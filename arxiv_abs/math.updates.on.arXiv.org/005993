The paper describes a number of simple but quite effective methods for constructing exact solutions
of PDEs, that involve a relatively small amount of intermediate calculations. The methods employ
two main ideas: (i) simple exact solutions can serve to construct more complex solutions of the equations
under consideration and (ii) exact solutions of some equations can serve to construct solutions
of other, more complex equations. In particular, we propose a method for constructing complex solutions
from simple solutions using translation and scaling. We show that in some cases, rather complex
solutions can be obtained by adding one or more terms to simpler solutions. There are situations
where nonlinear superposition allows us to construct a complex composite solution using similar
simple solutions. We also propose a few methods for constructing complex exact solutions to linear
and nonlinear PDEs by introducing complex-valued parameters into simpler solutions. The effectiveness
of the methods is illustrated by a large number of specific examples (over 30 in total). These include
nonlinear heat/diffusion equations, wave type equations, Klein--Gordon type equations, hydrodynamic
boundary layer equations, Navier--Stokes equations, and some other PDEs. Apart from exact solutions
to `ordinary' PDEs, we also describe some exact solutions to more complex nonlinear delay PDEs.
Along with the unknown function at the current time, $u=u(x,t)$, these equations contain the same
function at a past time, $w=u(x,t-\tau)$, where $\tau>0$ is the delay time. Furthermore, we look
at nonlinear partial functional-differential equations of the pantograph type, which in addition
to the unknown $u=u(x,t)$, also contain the same functions with dilated or contracted arguments,
$w=u(px,qt)$, where $p$ and $q$ are scaling parameters.

In this work, we present a new iterative exact solution algorithm for the weighted fair sequences
problem, which is a recently introduced NP-hard sequencing problem with applications in diverse
areas such as TV advertisement scheduling, periodic machine maintenance and real-time scheduling.
In the problem we are given an upper bound on the allowed solution sequence length and a list of symbols.
For each symbols, there is a positive weight and a number, which gives the minimum times the symbol
has to occur in a feasible solution sequence. The goal is to find a feasible sequence, which minimizes
the maximum weight-distance product, which is calculated for each consecutive appearance of each
symbol in the sequence, including the last and first appearance in the sequence, i.e., the sequence
is considered to be circular for the calculation of the objective function. Our proposed solution
algorithm is based on a new mixed-integer programming model for the problem for a fixed sequence
length. The model is enhanced with valid inequalities and variable fixings. We also develop an extended
model, which allows the definition of an additional set of valid inequalities and present additional
results which can allow us to skip the solution of the mixed-integer program for some sequence lengths.
We conduct a computational study on the instances from literature to assess the efficiency of our
newly proposed solution approach. Our approach manages to solve 404 of 440 instances to optimality
within the given timelimit, most of them within five minutes. The previous best existing solution
approach for the problem only managed to solve 229 of these instances, and its exactness depends
on an unproven conjecture. Moreover, our approach is up to two magnitudes faster compared to this
best existing solution approach.

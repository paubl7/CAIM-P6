Let f(1)=2, f(2)=4, and let f(n+1)=f(n)! for n>1. Edmund Landau's conjecture states that the set
P(n^2+1) of primes of the form n^2+1 is infinite. This conjecture implies the following unproven
statement F: card(P(n^2+1))<omega => P(n^2+1) subseteq [2,f(7)]. Let B denote the system {x_i!=x_k:
i,k in {1,...,9}} cup {x_i cdot x_j=x_k: i,j,k in {1,...,9}}. We write some system U subseteq B which
has exactly two solutions in positive integers x_1,...,x_9: (1,...,1) and (f(1),...,f(9)). We
write some system A subseteq B. Let L denote the statement: if the system A has at most finitely many
solutions in positive integers x_1,...,x_9, then each such solution (x_1,...,x_9) satisfies
x_1,...,x_9 leq f(9). The statement L is equivalent to the statement F. We explain the distinction
between existing algorithms and known algorithms. For every set X subseteq N, conditions (1)-(5)
probably imply that X is naturally defined. *** (1) A known algorithm with no input returns an integer
n satisfying card(X)<omega => X subseteq (-infty,n]. (2) A known algorithm for every k in N decides
whether or not k in X. (3) No known algorithm with no input returns the logical value of the statement
card(X)=omega. (4) There are many elements of X and it is conjectured that X is infinite. (5) X has
the simplest definition among known sets Y subseteq N with the same set of known elements. *** No known
set X subseteq N satisfies conditions (1)-(4) and is naturally defined or known in number theory.
F implies conditions (1)-(5) for X=P(n^2+1). The set X={k in N:(f(7)<k)=>(f(7),f(k)) cap P(n^2+1)
neq emptyset} satisfies conditions (1)-(4) and does not satisfy condition (5). No set X subseteq
N will satisfy conditions (1)-(4) forever, if for every algorithm with no input, at some future day,
a computer will be able to execute this algorithm in 1 second or less. The physical limits of computation
disprove this assumption.

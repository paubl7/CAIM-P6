La Fuenfr\'ia Hospital (LFH) operative parameters such as: hospitalised patients; daily admissions
and discharges were studies for the hospital as a whole, and per each Hospital's service unit (just
called "service" here). Data were used to build operative parameter value series and their variation.
Conventional statistical analyses and fractal dimension analyses were performed on the series.
Statistical analyses indicated that the data did not follow a Gauss (i.e. "normal") distribution,
thus nonparametric statistical analyses were chosen to describe data. The sequence of admitted
daily admissions and patients staying on each service were found to be a kind of random series of a
kind called random walks (Rw). Rw are sequences where what happens next ($ y_{t+\Delta t}$), depends
on what happens now ($ y_{t}$) plus a random variable ($ \epsilon $), $ y_{t+\Delta t}= y_t + \epsilon
$. Rw analysed with parametric or non parametric statistics may simulate cycles and drifts which
resemble seasonal variations or fake trends. Globally, admitted patients Rws in LFFH, were found
to be determined by the time elapsed between daily discharges and admissions. The factor determining
LFH Rw were found to be the difference between daily admissions and discharges. The analysis suggests
discharges are replaced by admissions with some random delay and that the random difference determinants
LFH Rws. The daily difference between hospitalised patients follows the same statistical distribution
as the daily difference between admissions and discharges. These suggest that if the daily difference
between admissions and discharges is minimised, i.e., a patient is admitted without delay when
another is discharged, the number of admitted panties would fluctuate less and the number of unoccupied
beds would be reduced optimising the Hospital service.

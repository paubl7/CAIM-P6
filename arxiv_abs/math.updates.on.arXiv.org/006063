We introduce a random differential operator, that we call the $\mathtt{CS}_\tau$ operator, whose
spectrum is given by the $\mbox{Sch}_\tau$ point process introduced by Kritchevski, Valk\'o and
Vir\'ag (2012) and whose eigenvectors match with the description provided by Rifkind and Vir\'ag
(2018). This operator acts on $\mathbf{R}^2$-valued functions from the interval $[0,1]$ and takes
the form: $$ 2 \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -\partial_t \\ \partial_t & 0 \end{pmatrix} + \sqrt{\tau} \begin{pmatrix}
d\mathcal{B} + \frac1{\sqrt 2} d\mathcal{W}_1 & \frac1{\sqrt 2} d\mathcal{W}_2\\ \frac1{\sqrt
2} d\mathcal{W}_2 & d\mathcal{B} - \frac1{\sqrt 2} d\mathcal{W}_1\end{pmatrix}\,, $$ where
$d\mathcal{B}$, $d\mathcal{W}_1$ and $d\mathcal{W}_2$ are independent white noises. Then,
we investigate the high part of the spectrum of the Anderson Hamiltonian $\mathcal{H}_L := -\partial_t^2
+ dB$ on the segment $[0,L]$ with white noise potential $dB$, when $L\to\infty$. We show that the
operator $\mathcal{H}_L$, recentred around energy levels $E \sim L/\tau$ and unitarily transformed,
converges in law as $L\to\infty$ to $\mathtt{CS}_\tau$ in an appropriate sense. This allows to
answer a conjecture of Rifkind and Vir\'ag (2018) on the behavior of the eigenvectors of $\mathcal{H}_L$.
Our approach also explains how such an operator arises in the limit of $\mathcal{H}_L$. Finally
we show that at higher energy levels, the Anderson Hamiltonian matches (asymptotically in $L$)
with the unperturbed Laplacian $-\partial_t^2$. In a companion paper, it is shown that at energy
levels much smaller than $L$, the spectrum is localized with Poisson statistics: the present paper
therefore identifies the delocalized phase of the Anderson Hamiltonian.

In this paper we consider a problem, called convex projection, of projecting a convex set onto a subspace.
We will show that to a convex projection one can assign a particular multi-objective convex optimization
problem, such that the solution to that problem also solves the convex projection (and vice versa),
which is analogous to the result in the polyhedral convex case considered in arXiv:1507.00228.
In practice, however, one can only compute approximate solutions in the (bounded or self-bounded)
convex case, which solve the problem up to a given error tolerance. We will show that for approximate
solutions a similar connection can be proven, but the tolerance level needs to be adjusted. That
is, an approximate solution of the convex projection solves the multi-objective problem only with
an increased error. Similarly, an approximate solution of the multi-objective problem solves
the convex projection with an increased error. In both cases the tolerance is increased proportionally
to a multiplier. These multipliers are deduced and shown to be sharp. These results allow to compute
approximate solutions to a convex projection problem by computing approximate solutions to the
corresponding multi-objective convex optimization problem, for which algorithms exist in the
bounded case. For completeness, we will also investigate the potential generalization of the following
result to the convex case. In arXiv:1507.00228, it has been shown for the polyhedral case, how to
construct a polyhedral projection associated to any given vector linear program and how to relate
their solutions. This in turn yields an equivalence between polyhedral projection, multi-objective
linear programming and vector linear programming. We will show that only some parts of this result
can be generalized to the convex case, and discuss the limitations.

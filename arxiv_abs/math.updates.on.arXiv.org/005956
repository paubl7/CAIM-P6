Theoretical studies on braiding phases among topological excitations are highly demanded for
identifying topological orders. In this paper, we provide a systematic approach towards complete
lists of mutually compatible braiding phases of topological orders in (3+1)D spacetime. More concretely,
considering a discrete gauge group $\prod^n_{i=1}\mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ as input data, topological
excitations in this paper are bosonic particles carrying gauge charges and loops carrying gauge
fluxes. Among these excitations, there are three classes of root braiding processes: particle-loop
braidings (i.e., the familiar Aharonov-Bohm phase of winding an electric charge around a thin magnetic
solenoid), multi-loop braidings [Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 080403 (2014)], and particle-loop-loop
braidings [i.e., Borromean-Rings braiding in Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 061601 (2018)]. A naive way
to exhaust all topological orders is just to arbitrarily combine these root braiding processes.
Surprisingly, we find that there exist sick combinations in which certain braiding phases cannot
coexist, i.e., are mutually incompatible. Thus, the resulting topological orders are illegitimate
and must be excluded. It is not obvious to identify sick combinations and understand why those braiding
phases cannot coexist. But with the help of the powerful (3+1)D topological quantum field theories
(TQFTs), we find that sick combinations necessarily violate properly-defined gauge invariance
if $\mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$ fusion rules strictly hold. In this way, we are able to obtain all sets of mutually
compatible braiding phases and corresponding legitimate topological orders. We work out all details
for $n=1$, $2$, $3$, and $4$. Our theory on excluding incompatible braidings can be straightforwardly
generalized to all other dimensions. To illustrate, we concisely discuss compatible braidings
and TQFTs in (4+1)D spacetime.

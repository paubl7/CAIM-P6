Spherical harmonic expansions (SHEs) play an important role in most of the physical sciences, especially
in physical geodesy. Despite many decades of investigation, the large order behavior of the SHE
coefficients, and the precise domain of convergence for these expansions, have remained open questions.
These questions are settled in the present paper for generic planets, whose shape (topography)
may include many local peaks, but just one globally highest peak. We show that regardless of the smoothness
of the density and topography, short of outright analyticity, the spherical harmonic expansion
of the gravitational potential converges exactly in the closure of the exterior of the Brillouin
sphere (The smallest sphere around the center of mass of the planet containing the planet in its interior),
and convergence below the Brillouin sphere occurs with probability zero. More precisely, such
over-convergence occurs on zero measure sets in the space of parameters. A related result is that,
in a natural Banach space, SHE convergence of the potential below the Brillouin sphere occurs for
potential functions in a subspace of infinite codimension (while any positive codimension already
implies occurrence of probability zero). Provided a certain limit in Fourier space exists, we find
the leading order asymptotic behavior of the coefficients of SHEs. We go further by finding a necessary
and sufficient condition for convergence below the Brillouin sphere, which requires a form of analyticity
at the highest peak, which would not hold for a realistic celestial body. Namely, a longitudinal
average of the harmonic measure on the Brillouin sphere would have to be real-analytic at the point
of contact with the boundary of the planet. It turns out that only a small neighborhood of the peak
is involved in this condition.

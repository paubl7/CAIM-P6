This document comprises Level Theory, parts 1-3. PART 1. The following bare-bones story introduces
the idea of a cumulative hierarchy of pure sets: 'Sets are arranged in stages. Every set is found at
some stage. At any stage S: for any sets found before S, we find a set whose members are exactly those
sets. We find nothing else at S.' Surprisingly, this story already guarantees that the sets are arranged
in well-ordered levels, and suffices for quasi-categoricity. I show this by presenting Level Theory,
a simplifiation of set theories due to Scott, Montague, Derrick, and Potter. PART 2. Potentialists
think that the concept of set is importantly modal. Using tensed language as an heuristic, the following
bare-bones story introduces the idea of a potential hierarchy of sets: 'Always: for any sets that
existed, there is a set whose members are exactly those sets; there are no other sets.' Surprisingly,
this story already guarantees well-foundedness and persistence. Moreover, if we assume that time
is linear, the ensuing modal set theory is almost definitionally equivalent with non-modal set
theories; specifically, with Level Theory, as developed in Part 1. PART 3. On a very natural conception
of sets, every set has an absolute complement. The ordinary cumulative hierarchy dismisses this
idea outright. But we can rectify this, whilst retaining classical logic. Indeed, we can develop
a boolean algebra of sets arranged in well-ordered levels. I show this by presenting Boolean Level
Theory, which fuses ordinary Level Theory (from Part 1) with ideas due to Thomas Forster, Alonzo
Church, and Urs Oswald. BLT neatly implement Conway's games and surreal numbers; and a natural extension
of BLT is definitionally equivalent with ZF.

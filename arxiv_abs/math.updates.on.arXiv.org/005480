We study family of dynamical systems on 2-torus modeling overdamped Josephson junction in superconductivity.
The family depends on three parameters $(B,A;\omega)$: $B$ (abscissa), $A$ (ordinate), $\omega$
(a fixed frequency). We study the rotation number $\rho(B,A;\omega)$ as a function of $(B,A)$ with
fixed $\omega$. A phase-lock area is a level set $L_r:=\{\rho=r\}$, if it has a non-empty interior.
This holds exactly for $r\in\mathbb Z$ (proved by V.M.Buchstaber, O.V.Karpov and S.I.Tertychnyi).
It is known that each phase-lock area is an infinite garland of domains going to infinity in the vertical
direction; each two neighbor domains are separated by one point, which is called constriction (if
it does not lie in the abscissa axis). We show that all the constrictions in $L_r$ lie in its axis $\{
B=\omega r\}$, confirming an experimental fact (conjecture) observed numerically by S.I.Tertychnyi,
V.A.Kleptsyn, D.A.Filimonov and I.V.Schurov. We prove that each constriction is positive: the
corresponding phase-lock area germ contains the vertical line germ (confirming another conjecture).
To do this, we study family of linear systems on the Riemann sphere equivalently describing the model:
the Josephson type systems. We study their Jimbo isomonodromic deformations (in a bigger class
of the so-called normalized $\mathbb R_+$-Jimbo type systems) described by solutions Painlev\'e
3 equations. Using results of this study, a Riemann--Hilbert approach and some previous results,
we show that each constriction can be analytically deformed to constrictions with arbitrarily
small $\omega$. Then non-existence of "ghost" constrictions (nonpositive or with wrong $\rho$)
for small $\omega$ is proved by slow-fast methods.

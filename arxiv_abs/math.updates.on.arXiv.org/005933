In simplicial complexes it is well known that many of the global properties of the complex, can be
deduced from expansion properties of its links. This phenomenon was first discovered by Garland
[G]. In this work we develop a local to global machinery for general posets. We first show that the
basic localization principle of Garland generalizes to more general posets. We then show that notable
local to global theorems for simplicial complexes arise from general principles for general posets
with expanding links. Specifically, we prove the following theorems for general posets satisfying
some assumptions: Expanding links (one sided expansion) imply fast convergence of high dimensional
random walks (generalization [KO,AL]); Expanding links imply Trickling down theorem (generalizing
[O]); and a poset has expanding links (with two sided expansion) iff it satisfies a global random
walk convergence property (generalization [DDFH]). We axiomatize general conditions on posets
that imply local to global theorems. By developing this local to global machinery for general posets
we discover that some posets behave better than simplicial complexes with respect to local to global
implications. Specifically, we get a trickling down theorem for some posets (e.g. the Grassmanian
poset) which is better behaved than the trickling down theorem known for simplicial complexes.
In addition to this machinery, we also present a method to construct a new poset out of a pair of an initial
poset and an auxiliary simplicial complex. By applying this procedure to the case where the pair
is the Grassmanian poset and a bounded degree high dimensional expander, we obtain a bounded degree
Grassmanian poset. We prove, using the tools described above, that this poset is a bounded degree
expanding Grassmanian poset, partially proving a conjecture of [DDFH].

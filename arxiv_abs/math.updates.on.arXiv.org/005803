For any suitable Optimal Control Problem (OCP) which satisfies the Principle of Optimality, there
exists a value function, defined as the unique viscosity solution to a HJB PDE, and which can be used
to design an optimal feedback controller for the given OCP. Solving the HJB analytically is rarely
possible, and existing numerical approximation schemes largely rely on discretization - implying
that the resulting approximate value functions may not have the useful property of being uniformly
less than or equal to the true value function (ie be sub-value functions). Furthermore, controllers
obtained from such schemes currently have no associated bound on performance. To address these
issues, for a given OCP, we propose a sequence of Sum-Of-Squares (SOS) problems, each of which yields
a polynomial sub-solution to the HJB PDE, and show that the resulting sequence of polynomial sub-solutions
converges to the value function of the OCP in the $L^1$ norm. Furthermore, for each polynomial sub-solution
in this sequence we define an associated sublevel set, and show that the resulting sequence of sublevel
sets converges to the sub-level set of the value function of the OCP in the volume metric. Next, for
any approximate value function, obtained from an SOS program or any other method (e.g. discretization),
we construct an associated feedback controller, and show that sub-optimality of this controller
as applied to the OCP is bounded by the distance between the approximate and true value function of
the OCP in the $W^{1,\infty}$ (Sobolev) norm. This result implies approximation of value functions
in the $W^{1,\infty}$ norm results in feedback controllers with performance that can be made arbitrarily
close to optimality. Finally, we demonstrate numerically that by solving our proposed SOS problem
we are able to accurately approximate value functions, design controllers and estimate reachable
sets.

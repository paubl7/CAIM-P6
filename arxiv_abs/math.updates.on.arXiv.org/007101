We study the semimartingale properties for the generalized fractional Brownian motion (GFBM)
introduced by Pang and Taqqu (2019) and discuss the applications of the GFBM and its mixtures to financial
models, including stock price and rough volatility. The GFBM is self-similar and has non-stationary
increments, whose Hurst index $H \in (0,1)$ is determined by two parameters. We identify the region
of these two parameter values where the GFBM is a semimartingale. Specifically, in one region resulting
in $H\in (1/2,1)$, it is in fact a process of finite variation and differentiable, and in another
region also resulting in $H\in (1/2,1)$ it is not a semimartingale. For regions resulting in $H \in
(0,1/2]$ except the Brownian motion case, the GFBM is also not a semimartingale. We also establish
$p$-variation results of the GFBM, which are used to provide an alternative proof of the non-semimartingale
property when $H < 1/2$. We then study the semimartingale properties of the mixed process made up
of an independent Brownian motion and a GFBM with a Hurst parameter $H \in (1/2,1)$, and derive the
associated equivalent Brownian measure. We use the GFBM and its mixture with a BM to study financial
asset models. The first application involves stock price models with long range dependence that
generalize those using shot noise processes and FBMs. The second application involves rough stochastic
volatility models. We focus in particular on a generalization of the rough Bergomi model introduced
by Bayer, Friz and Gatheral (2016), where instead of using the standard FBM to model the volatility,
we use the GFBM, and then derive an approximation for the VIX variance swaps and use numerical examples
to illustrate the impact of the non-stationarity parameter.

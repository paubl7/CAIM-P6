A well-known application of the Ramsey Theorem in the Banach Space Theory is the proof of the fact
that every normalized basic sequence has a subsequence which generates a spreading model (the Brunel-Sucheston
Theorem). Based on this application, as an intermediate step, we can talk about the notion of $(k,\varepsilon)-$oscillation
stable sequence, which will be described and analyzed more generally in this article. Indeed, we
introduce the notion $((\mathcal{B}_i)_{i=1}^k,\varepsilon)-$block oscillation stable sequence
where $(\mathcal{B}_i)_{i=1}^k$ is a finite sequence of barriers and using what we will call blocks
of barriers. In particular, we prove that the Ramsey Theorem is equivalent to the statement ``for
every finite sequence $(\mathcal{B}_i)_{i=1}^k$ of barriers, every $\varepsilon>0$ and every
normalized sequence $(x_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ there is a subsequence $(x_i)_{i\in M}$ that is
$((\mathcal{B}_i\cap\mathcal{P}(M))_{i=1}^k,\varepsilon)-$block oscillation stable'',
where $\mathcal{P}(M)$ is the power set of the infinite set M. Besides, we introduce the $(\mathcal{B}_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}-$block
asymptotic model of a normalized basic sequence where $(\mathcal{B}_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}$ is
a sequence of barriers. These models are a generalization of the spreading models and are related
to the $((\mathcal{B}_i)_{i=1}^k,\varepsilon)-$block oscillation stable sequences. We show
that the Brunel-Sucheston is satisfied for the $(\mathcal{B}_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}-$block asymptotic
models, and we also prove that this result is equivalent to the Ramsey Theorem. The difference between
our theorem and the Brunel-Sucheston Theorem is based on the number of different models that are
obtained from the same normalized basic sequence through them. This and other observations about
$(\mathcal{B}_i)_{i\in\mathbb{N}}-$block asymptotic models are noted in an example at the end
of the article.

Derived from a biophysical model for the motion of a crawling cell, the system \[(*)~\begin{cases}u_t=\Delta
u-\nabla\cdot(u\nabla v)\\0=\Delta v-kv+u\end{cases}\] is investigated in a finite domain
$\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq2$, with $k\geq0$. While a comprehensive literature is
available for cases with $(*)$ describing chemotaxis systems and hence being accompanied by homogeneous
Neumann-type boundary conditions, the presently considered modeling context, besides yet requiring
the flux $\partial_\nu u-u\partial_\nu v$ to vanish on $\partial\Omega$, inherently involves
homogeneous Dirichlet conditions for the attractant $v$, which in the current setting corresponds
to the cell's cytoskeleton being free of pressure at the boundary. This modification in the boundary
setting is shown to go along with a substantial change with respect to the potential to support the
emergence of singular structures: It is, inter alia, revealed that in contexts of radial solutions
in balls there exist two critical mass levels, distinct from each other whenever $k>0$ or $n\geq3$,
that separate ranges within which (i) all solutions are global in time and remain bounded, (ii) both
global bounded and exploding solutions exist, or (iii) all nontrivial solutions blow up in finite
time. While critical mass phenomena distinguishing between regimes of type (i) and (ii) belong
to the well-understood characteristics of $(*)$ when posed under classical no-flux boundary conditions
in planar domains, the discovery of a distinct secondary critical mass level related to the occurrence
of (iii) seems to have no nearby precedent. In the planar case with the domain being a disk, the analytical
results are supplemented with some numerical illustrations, and it is discussed how the findings
can be interpreted biophysically for the situation of a cell on a flat substrate.

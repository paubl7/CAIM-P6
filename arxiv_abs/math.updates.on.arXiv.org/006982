In this article, we discuss a set-valued generalization of strong proximinality in Banach spaces,
introduced as property-$(P_1)$ in the literature. We establish that if the closed unit ball of a
closed subspace of a Banach space $X$ possesses property-$(P_1)$ for each of the classes of closed
bounded, compact and finite subsets of $X$, then so does the subspace. It is also proved that the closed
unit ball of an $M$-ideal in an $L_{1}$-predual space satisfies property-$(P_{1})$ for the compact
subsets of the space. For a Choquet simplex $K$, we provide a sufficient condition for the closed
unit ball of a finite co-dimensional closed subspace of $A(K)$ to satisfy property-$(P_{1})$ for
the compact subsets of $A(K)$. This condition also helps to establish the equivalence of strong
proximinality of the closed unit ball of a finite co-dimensional subspace of $A(K)$ and property-$(P_{1})$
of the closed unit ball of the subspace for the compact subsets of $A(K)$. Further, for a compact Hausdorff
space $S$, a characterization is provided for a strongly proximinal finite co-dimensional closed
subspace of $C(S)$ in terms of property-$(P_{1})$ of the subspace and that of its closed unit ball
for the compact subsets of $C(S)$. As a consequence, we prove that such a subspace is a finite intersection
of hyperplanes such that each of these hyperplanes satisfy property-$(P_1)$ for its closed unit
balls for the compact subsets of the $L_1$-predual space and vice-versa. We generalize this characterization
for a strongly proximinal finite co-dimensional closed subspace of an $L_{1}$-predual space.
We conclude this article by providing an example of a closed subspace of a non-reflexive Banach space
which satisfies $1 \frac{1}{2}$-ball property and does not admit restricted Chebyshev centre
for a closed bounded subset of the Banach space.

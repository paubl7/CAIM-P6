We develop a framework for simulating measure-preserving, ergodic dynamical systems on a quantum
computer. Our approach provides a new operator-theoretic representation of classical dynamics
by combining ergodic theory with quantum information science. The resulting \emph{quantum compiler}
enables efficient simulation of spaces of classical observables with exponentially large dimension
using a quadratic number of quantum gates. The compiler is based on a quantum feature map that we introduce
for representing classical states by density operators on a reproducing kernel Hilbert space,
$\mathcal H$. Furthermore, an embedding of classical observables into self-adjoint operators
on $\mathcal H$ is established, such that quantum mechanical expectation values are consistent
with pointwise function evaluation. In this scheme, quantum states and observables evolve unitarily
under the lifted action of the Koopman evolution operators of the classical system. Moreover, by
virtue of the reproducing property of $\mathcal H$, the quantum system is pointwise-consistent
with the underlying classical dynamics. To achieve an exponential quantum computational advantage,
we project the state of the quantum system onto a finite-rank density operator on a $2^n$-dimensional
tensor product Hilbert space associated with $n$ qubits. By employing discrete Fourier-Walsh
transforms of spectral functions, the evolution operator of the finite-dimensional quantum system
is factorized into tensor product form, enabling implementation through an $n$-channel quantum
circuit with an $O(n)$ gates and no interchannel communication. Furthermore, the circuit features
a quantum Fourier transform stage with $O(n^2)$ gates, which generates predictions by measurement
in the standard computational basis. We implement the framework in Qiskit, and demonstrate its
consistency for prototypical periodic and quasiperiodic systems.

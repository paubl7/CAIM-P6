We consider a system of several collocated nodes sharing a time slotted wireless channel, and seek
a MAC that (i) provides low mean delay, (ii) has distributed control (i.e., there is no central scheduler),
and (iii) does not require explicit exchange of state information or control signals. The design
of such MAC protocols must keep in mind the need for contention access at light traffic, and scheduled
access in heavy traffic, leading to the long-standing interest in hybrid, adaptive MACs. We first
propose EZMAC, a simple extension of an existing decentralized, hybrid MAC called ZMAC. Next, motivated
by our results on delay and throughput optimality in partially observed, constrained queuing networks,
we develop another decentralized MAC protocol that we term QZMAC. A method to improve the short-term
fairness of QZMAC is proposed and analysed, and the resulting modified algorithm is shown to possess
better fairness properties than QZMAC. The theory developed to reduce delay is also shown to work
%with different traffic types (batch arrivals, for example) and even in the presence of transmission
errors and fast fading. Extensions to handle time critical traffic (alarms, for example) and hidden
nodes are also discussed. Practical implementation issues, such as handling Clear Channel Assessment
(CCA) errors, are outlined. We implement and demonstrate the performance of QZMAC on a test bed consisting
of CC2420 based Crossbow telosB motes, running the 6TiSCH communication stack on the Contiki operating
system over the 2.4GHz ISM band. Finally, using simulations, we show that both protocols achieve
mean delays much lower than those achieved by ZMAC, and QZMAC provides mean delays very close to the
minimum achievable in this setting, i.e., that of the centralized complete knowledge scheduler.

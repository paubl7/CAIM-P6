In this paper, we present strong numerical evidences that the $3$D incompressible axisymmetric
Navier-Stokes equations with degenerate diffusion coefficients and smooth initial data of finite
energy develop a potential finite time locally self-similar singularity at the origin. The spatial
part of the degenerate diffusion coefficient is a smooth function of $r$ and $z$ independent of the
solution and vanishes like $O(r^2)+O(z^2)$ near the origin. This potential singularity is induced
by a potential singularity of the $3$D Euler equations. An important feature of this potential singularity
is that the solution develops a two-scale traveling wave that travels towards the origin. The two-scale
feature is characterized by the property that the center of the traveling wave approaches the origin
at a slower rate than the rate of the collapse of the singularity. The driving mechanism for this potential
singularity is due to two antisymmetric vortex dipoles that generate a strong shearing layer in
both the radial and axial velocity fields. Without the viscous regularization, the $3$D Euler equations
develop an additional small scale characterizing the thickness of the sharp front. On the other
hand, the Navier-Stokes equations with a constant diffusion coefficient regularize the two-scale
solution structure and do not develop a finite time singularity for the same initial data. The initial
condition is designed in such a way that it generates a positive feedback loop that enforces a strong
nonlinear alignment of vortex stretching, leading to a stable locally self-similar blowup at the
origin. We perform careful resolution study and asymptotic scaling analysis to provide further
support of the potential finite time locally self-similar blowup.

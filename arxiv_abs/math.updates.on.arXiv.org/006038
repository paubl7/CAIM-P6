We prove the local well-posedness in Sobolev spaces and incompressible limit for the motion of a
compressible isentropic inviscid elastic fluid with moving physical vacuum boundary under Rayleigh-Taylor
sign condition. The deformation tensor satisfies the neo-Hookean linear elasticity and is tangential
to the free boundary. We apply the tangential smoothing method to set the approximation system.
Our key observation is that the structure of the wave equation of pressure together with Christodoulou-Lindblad
elliptic estimates reduces the energy estimates to the control of tangentially-differentiated
wave equations in spite of a potential loss of derivative in the source term. Then we use the hyperbolic
approach to solve the linearized system and standard iteration to the nonlinear counterpart to
establish the well-posedness. Our energy estimates are of no regularity loss and uniform in sound
speed which yields the incompressible limit: The solutions and energy functionals of the free-boundary
compressible elastodynamic equations converge to the incompressible counterpart provided the
convergence of initial datum. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result in free-boundary
compressible elastodynamics under Rayleigh-Taylor sign condition. It is worth emphasizing that
our method is completely applicable to compressible Euler equations. Our observation also shows
that it is not necessary to analyze the full time derivatives in boundary energy and higher order
wave equations as in the previous works of compressible Euler equations even if we require the energy
is uniform in sound speed. Moreover, the enhanced regularity for compressible Euler equations
obtained in Lindblad-Luo and Luo can still be recovered by a different further delicate analysis
of a slightly compressible elastic fluid.

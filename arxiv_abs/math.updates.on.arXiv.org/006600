We study the (characteristic) Cauchy problem for the Maxwell-Bloch equations of light-matter
interaction via asymptotics, under assumptions that prevent the generation of solitons. Our analysis
clarifies some features of the sense in which physically-motivated initial/boundary conditions
are satisfied. In particular, we present a proper Riemann-Hilbert problem that generates the unique
causal solution to the Cauchy problem, that is, the solution vanishes outside of the light cone.
Inside the light cone, we relate the leading-order asymptotics to self-similar solutions that
satisfy a system of ordinary differential equations related to the Painlev\'e-III (PIII) equation.
We identify these solutions and show that they are related to a family of PIII solutions recently
discovered in connection with several limiting processes involving the focusing nonlinear Schr\"odinger
equation. We fully explain a resulting boundary layer phenomenon in which, even for smooth initial
data (an incident pulse), the solution makes a sudden transition over an infinitesimally small
propagation distance. At a formal level, this phenomenon has been described by other authors in
terms of the PIII self-similar solutions. We make this observation precise and for the first time
we relate the PIII self-similar solutions to the Cauchy problem. Our analysis of the asymptotic
behavior satisfied by the optical field and medium density matrix reveals slow decay of the optical
field in one direction that is actually inconsistent with the simplest version of scattering theory.
Our results identify a precise generic condition on an optical pulse incident on an initially-unstable
medium sufficient for the pulse to stimulate the decay of the medium to its stable state.

We establish the existence of a broad class of asymptotically Euclidean solutions to Einstein's
constraint equations whose asymptotic behavior is a priori prescribed. The seed-to-solution
method (as we call it) proposed in this paper encompasses vacuum spaces as well as spaces with (possibly
slowly decaying) matter, and generates a Riemannian manifold from any seed data set consisting
of (1): a Riemannian metric and a symmetric two-tensor on a manifold with finitely many asymptotically
Euclidean ends, and (2): a (density) field and a (momentum) vector field representing the matter
content. We distinguish between several classes of seed data referred to as tame or strongly tame,
depending whether the data provides a rough or an accurate asymptotic Ansatz at infinity. We encompass
metrics with the weakest possible decay at infinity, as well as with the strongest possible decay.
Our analysis is based on a linearization of the Einstein operator around a seed data and is motivated
by Carlotto and Schoen's pioneering work on the localization problem for Einstein's vacuum equations.
Dealing with possibly very low decay and establishing estimates beyond the critical decay require
significantly new arguments. In a weighted Lebesgue-Holder framework adapted to the seed data,
we analyze the nonlinear coupling between the Hamiltonian and momentum constraints and study critical
terms, and uncover the novel notion of mass-momentum correctors. We estimate the difference between
the seed data and the actual Einstein solution, a result that should be of interest for numerical
computations. Next, we introduce and study the asymptotic localization problem (as we call it)
in which the Carlotto-Schoen's localization property is required in an asymptotic sense only.
By applying our method to a suitably parametrized family of seed data, we solve this problem at the
critical decay level.

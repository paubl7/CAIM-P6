There are many scenarios such as the electronic health records where the outcome is much more difficult
to collect than the covariates. In this paper, we consider the linear regression problem with such
a data structure under the high dimensionality. Our goal is to investigate when and how the unlabeled
data can be exploited to improve the estimation and inference of the regression parameters in linear
models, especially in light of the fact that such linear models may be misspecified in data analysis.
In particular, we address the following two important questions. (1) Can we use the labeled data
as well as the unlabeled data to construct a semi-supervised estimator such that its convergence
rate is faster than the supervised estimators? (2) Can we construct confidence intervals or hypothesis
tests that are guaranteed to be more efficient or powerful than the supervised estimators? To address
the first question, we establish the minimax lower bound for parameter estimation in the semi-supervised
setting. We show that the upper bound from the supervised estimators that only use the labeled data
cannot attain this lower bound. We close this gap by proposing a new semi-supervised estimator which
attains the lower bound. To address the second question, based on our proposed semi-supervised
estimator, we propose two additional estimators for semi-supervised inference, the efficient
estimator and the safe estimator. The former is fully efficient if the unknown conditional mean
function is estimated consistently, but may not be more efficient than the supervised approach
otherwise. The latter usually does not aim to provide fully efficient inference, but is guaranteed
to be no worse than the supervised approach, no matter whether the linear model is correctly specified
or the conditional mean function is consistently estimated.

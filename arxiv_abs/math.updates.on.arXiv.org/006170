In dynamical systems, a hidden attractor is an attracting set, which cannot be localized by a trajectory
starting from a small neighbourhood of any equilibrium. Without appealing to special analytical-numerical
procedures and the intuition behind them, hidden attractors in multiparameter families of systems
(especially infinite-dimensional ones) can be only discovered by an accident. In this paper we
follow the feedback gain intuition and its justification via the generalized Poincar\'{e}-Bendixson
theory for infinite-dimensional systems. As a result, we discover hidden periodic orbits in the
Suarez-Schopf delayed oscillator for El Ni\~no-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) with parameters
from the linear stability region. Moreover, from our developments on inertial (slow) manifolds
theory we show that hidden oscillations coexist with single unstable periodic orbits and that self-excited
oscillations must coexist with pairs of unstable periodic orbits. The corresponding phase portraits
transit into each other through a bifurcation of a homoclinic ``figure eight''. We propose a description
of the dynamics in the linear stability region by dividing it to subregions corresponding to self-excited
oscillations, hidden oscillations and the non-oscillatory part. For different parameters from
the hidden oscillations region there is a variety of periods, which may correspond to real ENSO events.
Multistability in the hidden oscillations region may correspond to the stochastic irregularity
of ENSO. On the other hand, a homoclinic ``figure eight'' may lead to reach (chaotic) dynamics under
a small amplitude periodic forcing. Thus, the simple Suarez-Schopf model may become a basis for
both theories of irregularity. We also propose a smaller non-oscillatory region (motivated by
dimension estimates), which can be analytically described.

Emotions are a central key for understanding human beings and of fun-damental importance regarding
their impact in human and animal behaviors.They have been for a long time a subject of study for various
scholars includ-ing in particular philosophers and mystics [29, 5, 7, 36, 35, 22, 27, 31]. Inmodern
science, the emotional phenomenon has attracted for a few decadesan increasing number of studies,
notably in the fields of Psychology, Psy-chiatry, Neuroscience and Biochemistry [1, 3, 2, 9, 11,
17, 16, 19, 20, 23,24, 25, 26, 32, 34]. However, since our perception of emotions is not, sofar, directly
detectable nor recordable by our measure instruments, Physicsand Mathematics have not been so
far used academically to provide a pre-cise description of the phenomenon of feeling an emotion.
Relying upon theworks of O. Elahi [10, 14] and on the hypothesis that the human soul and itspsyche
may manifest in ourselves (in both conscious and unconscious man-ner) in an analog way as electromagnetic
waves [13], we propose here a fewmathematical descriptions consistent with the human personal
experience,of the feeling and cognition of emotions. As far as we know, such a mathe-matical description
has never been provided before. It allows a quantitative(intensity) and qualitative (nature of
feelings/frequency) of the emotionalphenomenon which provides a novel scientific approach of
the nature of the mind, complementary to the on going research of physiological manifesta-tion
of emotions. We anticipate such an approach and the associated math-ematical modeling to become
an important tool to describe emotions andtheir subsequent behavior. In complement of the modeling
of oscillationsand brain dynamics[4, 8, 28], it provides a fruitful direction of research withpotentially
broad and deep impacts in both applied mathematics, physics,cognitive and behavioral sciences.

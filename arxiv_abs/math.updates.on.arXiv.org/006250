We propose new structures called almost o-minimal structures and $\mathfrak X$-structures. The
former is a first-order expansion of a dense linear order without endpoints such that the intersection
of a definable set with a bounded open interval is a finite union of points and open intervals. The
latter is a variant of van den Dries and Miller's analytic geometric categories and Shiota's $\mathfrak
X$-sets and $\mathfrak Y$-sets. In them, the family of definable sets are closed only under proper
projections unlike first-order structures. We demonstrate that an $\mathfrak X$-expansion of
an ordered divisible abelian group always contains an o-minimal expansion of an ordered group such
that all bounded $\mathfrak X$-definable sets are definable in the structure. Another contribution
of this paper is a uniform local definable cell decomposition theorem for almost o-minimal expansions
of ordered groups $\mathcal M=(M,<,0,+,\ldots)$. Let $\{A_\lambda\}_{\lambda\in\Lambda}$
be a finite family of definable subsets of $M^{m+n}$. Take an arbitrary positive element $R \in M$
and set $B=]-R,R[^n$. Then, there exists a finite partition into definable sets \begin{equation*}
M^m \times B = X_1 \cup \ldots \cup X_k \end{equation*} such that $B=(X_1)_b \cup \ldots \cup (X_k)_b$
is a definable cell decomposition of $B$ for any $b \in M^m$ and either $X_i \cap A_\lambda = \emptyset$
or $X_i \subseteq A_\lambda$ for any $1 \leq i \leq k$ and $\lambda \in \Lambda$. Here, the notation
$S_b$ denotes the fiber of a definable subset $S$ of $M^{m+n}$ at $b \in M^m$. We introduce the notion
of multi-cells and demonstrate that any definable set is a finite union of multi-cells in the course
of the proof of the above theorem.

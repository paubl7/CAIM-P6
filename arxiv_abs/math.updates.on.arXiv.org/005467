Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are regarded as a key enabler of green wireless communication,
due to their capability of customizing favorable wireless propagation environments. In this paper,
we investigate resource allocation for IRS-assisted green multiuser multiple-input single-output
(MISO) systems. To minimize the total transmit power, both the beamforming vectors at the access
point (AP) and the phase shifts at multiple IRSs are jointly optimized, while taking into account
the minimum required quality-of-service (QoS) of multiple users. First, two novel algorithms,
namely a penalty-based alternating minimization (AltMin) algorithm and an inner approximation
(IA) algorithm, are developed to tackle the non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem
when perfect channel state information (CSI) is available. Unlike existing designs that cannot
ensure convergence, the proposed penalty-based AltMin and IA algorithms are guaranteed to converge
to a stationary point and a Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) solution of the design problem, respectively.
Second, the impact of imperfect knowledge of the CSI of the channels between the AP and the users is
investigated. To this end, a non-convex robust optimization problem is formulated and the penalty-based
AltMin algorithm is extended to obtain a stationary solution. Simulation results reveal a key trade-off
between the speed of convergence and the achievable total transmit power for the two proposed algorithms.
In addition, we show that the proposed algorithms can significantly reduce the total transmit power
at the AP compared to various baseline schemes and that the optimal numbers of transmit antennas
and IRS reflecting elements, which minimize the total power consumption of the considered system,
are finite.

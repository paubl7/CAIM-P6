In ptychography experiments, redundant scanning is usually required to guarantee the stable recovery,
such that a huge amount of frames are generated, and thus it poses a great demand of parallel computing
in order to solve this large-scale inverse problem. In this paper, we propose the overlapping Domain
Decomposition Methods (DDMs) to solve the nonconvex optimization problem in ptychographic imaging,
that decouple the problem defined on the whole domain into subproblems only defined on the subdomains
with synchronizing information on the interface of these subdomains, thus leading to highly parallel
algorithms with good load balance. More specifically, for the nonblind recovery (with known probe
in advance), by enforcing the continuity of the overlapping region for the image (sample), the nonlinear
optimization model is established based on a novel smooth-truncated amplitude-Gaussian metric.
Then the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) is utilized to generate an efficient
Overlapping Domain Decomposition based Ptychography algorithm (OD2P) for the two-subdomain
domain decomposition (DD), where all subproblems can be computed with close-form solutions. Due
to the Lipschitz continuity for the gradient of the objective function, the convergence of the proposed
OD2P is derived under mild conditions. Moreover, it is extended to more general case including multiple-subdomain
DD and blind recovery. Numerical experiments are further conducted to show the performance of proposed
algorithms, demonstrating good convergence speed and robustness to the noise. Especially, we
report the virtual wall-clock time of proposed algorithm, which shows great potential for parallel
computing in massively parallel processing computers.

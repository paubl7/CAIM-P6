The Loewner framework-(LF) in combination with Volterra series-(VS) offers a non-intrusive approximation
method that is capable of identifying bilinear models from time-domain measurements. This method
uses harmonic inputs which establish a natural way for data acquisition. For the general class of
nonlinear problems with VS representation, the growing exponential approach allows the derivation
of the generalized kernels, namely symmetric generalized frequency response functions - (GFRFs).
In addition, the homogeneity of the Volterra operator determines the accuracy in terms of how many
kernels are considered. For the weakly nonlinear setup, only a few kernels are needed to obtain a
good approximation. In this direction, the proposed adaptive scheme is able to improve the estimations
of the computationally non-zero kernels. The Fourier transform associates these measurements
with the derived GFRFs and the LF makes the connection with system theory. In the linear case, the
LF associates the so-called S-parameters with the linear transfer function by interpolating in
the frequency domain. The goal of the proposed method is to extend identification to the case of bilinear
systems from time-domain measurements and to approximate other general nonlinear systems (by
means of the Carleman bilinearizarion scheme). By identifying the linear contribution with the
LF, a considerable reduction is achieved by means of the SVD. The fitted linear system has the same
McMillan degree as the original linear system. Then, the performance of the linear model is improved
by augmenting a special nonlinear structure. In a nutshell, we learn reduced-dimension bilinear
models directly from a potentially large-scale system that is simulated in the time domain. This
is done by fitting first a linear model, and afterwards, by fitting the corresponding bilinear operator.

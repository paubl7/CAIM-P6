Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems require downlink channel state information
(CSI) at the base station (BS) to achieve spatial diversity and multiplexing gains. In a frequency
division duplex (FDD) multiuser massive MIMO network, each user needs to compress and feedback
its downlink CSI to the BS. The CSI overhead scales with the number of antennas, users and subcarriers,
and becomes a major bottleneck for the overall spectral efficiency. In this paper, we propose a deep
learning (DL)-based CSI compression scheme, called DeepCMC, composed of convolutional layers
followed by quantization and entropy coding blocks. In comparison with previous DL-based CSI reduction
structures, DeepCMC proposes a novel fully-convolutional neural network (NN) architecture,
with residual layers at the decoder, and incorporates quantization and entropy coding blocks into
its design. DeepCMC is trained to minimize a weighted rate-distortion cost, which enables a trade-off
between the CSI quality and its feedback overhead. Simulation results demonstrate that DeepCMC
outperforms the state of the art CSI compression schemes in terms of the reconstruction quality
of CSI for the same compression rate. We also propose a distributed version of DeepCMC for a multi-user
MIMO scenario to encode and reconstruct the CSI from multiple users in a distributed manner. Distributed
DeepCMC not only utilizes the inherent CSI structures of a single MIMO user for compression, but
also benefits from the correlations among the channel matrices of nearby users to further improve
the performance in comparison with DeepCMC. We also propose a reduced-complexity training method
for distributed DeepCMC, allowing to scale it to multiple users, and suggest a cluster-based distributed
DeepCMC approach for practical implementation.

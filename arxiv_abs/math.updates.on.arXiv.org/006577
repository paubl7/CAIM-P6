In this paper we consider the coalescing random walk model on general graphs $G=(V,E)$. We set up
a unified framework to study the leading order of decay rate of $P_t$, the expectation of the fraction
of occupied sites at time $t$, particularly for the `Big Bang' regime where $t\ll t_{\text{coal}}:=\mathbb{E}[\inf\{s:\text{There
is only one particle at time }s\}]$. Our results show that $P_t$ satisfies certain mean field behavior,
if the graphs satisfy certain transience-like conditions. We apply this framework to two families
of graphs: (1) graphs given by configuration model with degree $\ge 3$, and (2) finite and infinite
vertex-transitive graphs. In the first case, we show that for $1 \ll t \ll |V|$, $P_t$ decays in the
order of $t^{-1}$, and $(tP_t)^{-1}$ is approximately the probability that two particles starting
from the root of the corresponding unimodular Galton-Watson tree never collide after one of them
leaves the root, which is also roughly $|V|/(2t_{\text{meet}})$, where $t_{\text{meet}}$ is
the mean meeting time of two independent walkers. By taking the local weak limit, for the corresponding
unimodular Galton-Watson tree we prove convergence of $tP_t$ as $t\to\infty$. For the second family
of graphs, if we take a sequence of finite vertex-transitive graphs $G_n=(V_n, E_n)$, such that
$t_{\text{meet}}=O(|V_n|)$ and the inverse of the spectral gap $t_{\text{rel}}$ is $o(|V_n|)$,
then for $t_{\text{rel}}\ll t\ll t_{\text{coal}}$, $(tP_t)^{-1}$ is approximately the probability
that two random walks never meet before time $t$, and also $|V|/(2t_{\text{meet}})$. In addition,
we define a natural uniform transience condition, and show that in the transitive setup it implies
the above for all $1\ll t\ll t_{\text{coal}}$. Such estimates of $tP_t$ are also obtained for all
infinite transient transitive unimodular graphs, in particular, all transient transitive amenable
graphs.

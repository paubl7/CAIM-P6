We pursue two goals in this article. As our first goal, we construct a family $\mathcal{M}_G$ of Gibbs
like measures on the set of piecewise linear convex functions $g:\mathbb{R}^2\to\mathbb{R}$.
It turns out that there is a one-to-one correspondence between the gradient of such convex functions
and $\textit{Laguerre tessellations}$. Each cell in a Laguerre tessellation is a convex polygon
that is marked by a vector $\rho\in\mathbb{R}^2$. Each measure $\nu^f\in\mathcal{M}_G$ in our
family is uniquely characterized by a kernel $f(x,\rho^-,\rho^+)$, which represents the rate
at which a line separating two cells associated with marks $\rho^-$ and $\rho^+$ passes through
$x$. To construct our measures, we give a precise recipe for the law of the restriction of our tessellation
to a box. This recipe involves a boundary condition, and a dynamical description of our random tessellation
inside the box. As we enlarge the box, the consistency of these random tessellations requires that
the kernel satisfies a suitable kinetic like PDE. As our second goal, we study the invariance of the
set $\mathcal{M}_G$ with respect to the dynamics of such Hamilton-Jacobi PDEs. In particular we
$\textit{conjecture}$ the invariance of a suitable subfamily $\widehat{\mathcal{M}_G}$ of
$\mathcal{M}_G$. More precisely, we expect that if the initial slope $u_x(\cdot,0)$ is selected
according to a measure $\nu^{f}\in \widehat{\mathcal{M}_G}$, then at a later time the law of $u_x(\cdot,
t)$ is given by a measure $\nu^{\Theta_t(f)}\in\widehat{\mathcal{M}_G}$, for a suitable kernel
$\Theta_t(f)$. As we vary $t$, the kernel $\Theta_t(f)$ must satisfy a suitable kinetic equation.
We remark that the function $u$ is also piecewise linear convex function in $(x,t)$, and its law is
an example of a Gibbs-like measure on the set of Laguerre tessellations of certain convex subsets
of $\mathbb{R}^3$.

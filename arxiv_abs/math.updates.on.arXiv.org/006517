In this paper, we characterize the performance of a three-dimensional (3D) two-hop cellular network
in which terrestrial base stations (BSs) coexist with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to serve
a set of ground user equipment (UE). In particular, UEs connect either directly to BSs by access links
or indirectly through UAVs to BSs by joint access and backhaul links, where the BSs provide wireless
backhaul to the UAVs. We consider realistic antenna radiation patterns for both BSs and UAVs using
practical models developed by the third generation partnership project (3GPP). We assume a probabilistic
channel model for the air-to-ground transmission, which incorporates both line-of-sight (LoS)
and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) links. Assuming the max-power association policy, we study the performance
of the network in both amplify-and-forward (AF) and decode-and-forward (DF) relaying protocols.
Using tools from stochastic geometry, we analyze the joint distribution of distance and zenith
angle of the closest (and serving) UAV to the origin in a 3D setting. Further, we identify and extensively
study key mathematical constructs as the building blocks of characterizing the received signal-to-interference-plus-noise
ratio (SINR) distribution. Using these results, we obtain exact mathematical expressions for
the coverage probability in both AF and DF relaying protocols. Furthermore, considering the fact
that backhaul links could be quite weak because of the downtilted antennas at the BSs, we propose
and analyze the addition of a directional uptilted antenna at the BS that is solely used for backhaul
purposes. The superiority of having directional antennas with wirelessly backhauled UAVs is further
demonstrated via simulation.

Single index models provide an effective dimension reduction tool in regression, especially for
high dimensional data, by projecting a general multivariate predictor onto a direction vector.
We propose a novel single-index model for regression models where metric space-valued random object
responses are coupled with multivariate Euclidean predictors. The responses in this regression
model include complex, non-Euclidean data, including covariance matrices, graph Laplacians
of networks, and univariate probability distribution functions among other complex objects that
lie in abstract metric spaces. Fr\'echet regression has provided an approach for modeling the conditional
mean of such random objects given multivariate Euclidean vectors, but it does not provide for regression
parameters such as slopes or intercepts, since the metric space-valued responses are not amenable
to linear operations. We show here that for the case of multivariate Euclidean predictors, the parameters
that define a single index and associated projection vector can be used to substitute for the inherent
absence of parameters in Fr\'echet regression. Specifically, we derive the asymptotic consistency
of suitable estimates of these parameters subject to an identifiability condition. Consistent
estimation of the link function of the single index Fr\'echet regression model is obtained through
local Fr\'echet regression. We demonstrate the finite sample performance of estimation for the
proposed single index Fr\'echet regression model through simulation studies, including the special
cases of probability distributions and graph adjacency matrices. The method is also illustrated
for resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data from the ADNI study.

We consider the quasilinear 1D inverse heat convection problem (IHCP) of determining the enthalpy-dependent
heat fluxes from noisy internal enthalpy measurements. This problem arises in the Accelerated
Cooling (ACC) process of producing thermomechanically controlled processed (TMCP) heavy plates
made of steel. In order to adjust the complex microstructure of the underlying material, the Leidenfrost
behavior of the hot surfaces with respect to the application of the cooling fluid has to be studied.
Since the heat fluxes depend on the enthalpy and hence on the solution of the underlying initial boundary
value problem (IBVP), the parameter-to-solution operator, and thus the forward operator of the
inverse problem, can only be defined implicitly. To guarantee well-defined operators, we study
two approaches for showing existence and uniqueness of solutions of the IBVP. One approach deals
with the theory of pseudomonotone operators and so-called strong solutions in Sobolev-Bochner
spaces. The other theory uses classical solutions in H\"older spaces. Whereas the first approach
yields a solution under milder assumptions, it fails to show the uniqueness result in contrast to
the second approach. Furthermore, we propose a convenient parametrization approach for the nonlinear
heat fluxes in order to decouple the parameter-to-solution relation and use an iterative solver
based on a Projected Quasi-Newton (PQN) method together with box-constraints to solve the inverse
problem. For numerical experiments, we derive the necessary gradient information of the objective
functional and use the discrepancy principle as a stopping rule. Numerical tests show that the PQN
method outperforms the Landweber method with respect to computing time and approximation accuracy.

The hypercontractive inequality on the discrete cube plays a crucial role in many fundamental results
in the Analysis of Boolean functions, such as the KKL theorem, Friedgut's junta theorem and the invariance
principle. In these results the cube is equipped with the uniform measure, but it is desirable, particularly
for applications to the theory of sharp thresholds, to also obtain such results for general $p$-biased
measures. However, simple examples show that when $p = o(1)$, there is no hypercontractive inequality
that is strong enough. In this paper, we establish an effective hypercontractive inequality for
general $p$ that applies to `global functions', i.e. functions that are not significantly affected
by a restriction of a small set of coordinates. This class of functions appears naturally, e.g. in
Bourgain's sharp threshold theorem, which states that such functions exhibit a sharp threshold.
We demonstrate the power of our tool by strengthening Bourgain's theorem, thereby making progress
on a conjecture of Kahn and Kalai and by establishing a $p$-biased analog of the invariance principle.
Our results have significant applications in Extremal Combinatorics. Here we obtain new results
on the Tur\'an number of any bounded degree uniform hypergraph obtained as the expansion of a hypergraph
of bounded uniformity. These are asymptotically sharp over an essentially optimal regime for both
the uniformity and the number of edges and solve a number of open problems in the area. In particular,
we give general conditions under which the crosscut parameter asymptotically determines the Tur\'an
number, answering a question of Mubayi and Verstra\"ete. We also apply the Junta Method to refine
our asymptotic results and obtain several exact results, including proofs of the Huang--Loh--Sudakov
conjecture on cross matchings and the F\"uredi--Jiang--Seiver conjecture on path expansions.

The gold standard of a wireless network is that the throughput increases linearly with the density
of access points (APs). However, such a linear throughput gain is suspended in the 5G mmWave network
mainly due to the short communication distances in mmWave bands and the dense deployments of mmWave
APs. As being operated in the interference-limited regime, the aggregate interference resulted
from the increasing mmWave APs will gradually become the network performance bottleneck, which
leads to the saturation of the throughput. In this paper, we propose to overcome the densification
plateau of a mmWave network by employing spatial multiplexing at APs. To study the effect of spatial
multiplexing on mmWave networks, we first derive the coverage probability as a function of spatial
multiplexing gain. The fixed-rate coding scheme is then used to provide the network throughput.
We also introduce the concept of densification gain to capture the improvement in network throughput
achieved through the AP densification. Our results indicate that without the spatial multiplexing
at APs, the throughput of mmWave networks will reach the plateau when the density of APs becomes sufficiently
large. By enabling the spatial multiplexing at APs, however, the mmWave network can continuously
harvest the throughput gains as the number of APs grows. By deriving the upper bound for the throughput
of mmWave networks, we quantify the potential throughput improvement as the spatial multiplexing
gain increases. However, our numerical results show that such a potential throughput gain cannot
be explored by the fixed-rate coding scheme. We then demonstrate the necessity for deploying the
multi-rate coding scheme in mmWave networks, especially when the spatial multiplexing gain at
mmWave APs is large.

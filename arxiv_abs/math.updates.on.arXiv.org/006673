The analysis of nematics shells has recently become of great importance, with novel applications
ranging from the creation of colloidal materials using DNA strands, to inventing contact lenses
capable of changing their dioptre. In this piece, we analyse the orientation of a thin nematic film
on the surface of a smooth manifold, specifically the strength of point defects located on the surface
and the boundary. We model the orientation by a unit vector field which is orthogonal to the surface
normal, in this model defects are points where the localised index is non-zero, this motivates us
to derive a generalisation to the Poincare-Hopf theorem, which connects the total index of a vector
field to the Euler characteristic of the surface, the sum of the interior angles and the integral
of the boundary data. In liquid crystals one of the first models derived is the Oseen-Frank energy
density, in this piece we consider the one constant approximation with respect to the curved geometry.
The energy density diverges to infinity as one approaches a point defect of non-zero strength. Thus
for a given manifold and vector field we derive a lower bound for the rate of energy divergence. This
divergence rate is a function of the defect strengths and local curvatures, thus observable configurations
of defects must minimise this rate of divergence, whilst also obeying the generalisation to the
Poincare-Hopf theorem we derived earlier. Thus using these principle we create a heuristic method
to predict the defect strengths of a nematic shell given purely geometrical parameters and boundary
data. This is then contrasted with known results from both the experimental and numerical results
within the liquid crystal community.

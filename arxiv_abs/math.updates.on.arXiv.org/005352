We study the combinatorial Teichm\"uller space and construct on it global coordinates, analogous
to the Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates on the ordinary Teichm\"uller space. We prove that these coordinates
form an atlas with piecewise linear transition functions, and constitute global Darboux coordinates
for the Kontsevich symplectic structure on top-dimensional cells. We then set up the geometric
recursion in the sense of Andersen-Borot-Orantin adapted to the combinatorial setting, which
naturally produces mapping class group invariant functions on the combinatorial Teichm\"uller
spaces. We establish a combinatorial analogue of the Mirzakhani-McShane identity fitting this
framework. As applications, we obtain geometric proofs of Witten conjecture/Kontsevich theorem
(Virasoro constraints for $\psi$-classes intersections) and of Norbury's topological recursion
for the lattice point count in the combinatorial moduli spaces. These proofs arise now as part of
a unified theory and proceed in perfect parallel to Mirzakhani's proof of topological recursion
for the Weil-Petersson volumes. We move on to the study of the spine construction and the associated
rescaling flow on the Teichm\"uller space. We strengthen former results of Mondello and Do on the
convergence of this flow. In particular, we prove convergence of hyperbolic Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates
to the combinatorial ones with some uniformity. This allows us to effectively carry natural constructions
on the Teichm\"uller space to their analogues in the combinatorial spaces. For instance, we obtain
the piecewise linear structure on the combinatorial Teichm\"uller space as the limit of the smooth
structure on the Teichm\"uller space. To conclude, we provide further applications to the enumerative
geometry of multicurves, Masur-Veech volumes and measured foliations in the combinatorial setting.

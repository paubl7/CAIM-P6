This paper proposes a plane wave activation based neural network (PWNN) for solving Helmholtz equation,
the basic partial differential equation to represent wave propagation, e.g. acoustic wave, electromagnetic
wave, and seismic wave. Unlike using traditional activation based neural network (TANN) or $sin$
activation based neural network (SIREN) for solving general partial differential equations,
we instead introduce a complex activation function $e^{\mathbf{i}{x}}$, the plane wave which
is the basic component of the solution of Helmholtz equation. By a simple derivation, we further
find that PWNN is actually a generalization of the plane wave partition of unity method (PWPUM) by
additionally imposing a learned basis with both amplitude and direction to better characterize
the potential solution. We firstly investigate our performance on a problem with the solution is
an integral of the plane waves with all known directions. The experiments demonstrate that: PWNN
works much better than TANN and SIREN on varying architectures or the number of training samples,
that means the plane wave activation indeed helps to enhance the representation ability of neural
network toward the solution of Helmholtz equation; PWNN has competitive performance than PWPUM,
e.g. the same convergence order but less relative error. Furthermore, we focus a more practical
problem, the solution of which only integrate the plane waves with some unknown directions. We find
that PWNN works much better than PWPUM at this case. Unlike using the plane wave basis with fixed directions
in PWPUM, PWNN can learn a group of optimized plane wave basis which can better predict the unknown
directions of the solution. The proposed approach may provide some new insights in the aspect of
applying deep learning in Helmholtz equation.

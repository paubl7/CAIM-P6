Multiple methods for deriving the energy-momentum tensor for a physical theory exist in the literature.
The most common methods are to use Noether's first theorem with the 4-parameter Poincar\'{e} translation,
or to write the action in a curved spacetime and perform variation with respect to the metric tensor,
then return to a Minkowski spacetime. These are referred to as the Noether and Hilbert (metric/ curved
space/ variational) energy-momentum tensors, respectively. In electrodynamics and other simple
models, the Noether and Hilbert methods yield the same result. Due to this fact, it is often asserted
that these methods are generally equivalent for any theory considered, and that this gives physicists
a freedom in using either method to derive an energy-momentum tensor depending on the problem at
hand. $\dots$ For spin-2, the ideal candidate to check this equivalence for a more complicated model,
there exist many energy-momentum tensors in the literature, none of which are gauge invariant,
so it is not clear which expression one hopes to obtain from the Noether and Hilbert approaches unlike
in the case of e.g. electrodynamics. It has been shown, however, that the linearized Gauss-Bonnet
gravity model (second order derivatives, second rank tensor potential) has an energy-momentum
tensor that is unique, gauge invariant, symmetric, conserved, and trace-free when derived from
Noether's first theorem (all the same properties of the physical energy-momentum tensor of electrodynamics).
This makes it the ideal candidate to check if the Noether and Hilbert methods coincide for a more complicated
model. It is proven here using this model as a counterexample, by direct calculation, that the Noether
and Hilbert energy-momentum tensors are not, in general, equivalent.

Motivated by the increasing popularity and the seemingly broad applicability of pair-copula constructions
underlined by numerous publications in the last decade, in this contribution we tackle the unavoidable
question on how flexible and simplifying the commonly used `simplifying assumption' is from an
analytic perspective and provide answers to two related open questions posed by Nagler and Czado
in 2016. Aiming at a simplest possible setup for deriving the main results we first focus on the three-dimensional
setting. We prove that the family of simplified copulas is flexible in the sense that it is dense in
the set of all three-dimensional co\-pulas with respect to the uniform metric $d_\infty$ - considering
stronger notions of convergence like the one induced by the metric $D_1$, by weak conditional convergence,
by total variation, or by Kullback-Leibler divergence, however, the family even turn out to be nowhere
dense and hence insufficient for any kind of flexible approximation. Furthermore, returning to
$d_\infty$ we show that the partial vine copula is never the optimal simplified copula approximation
of a given, non-simplified copula $C$, and derive examples illustrating that the corresponding
approximation error can be strikingly large and extend to more than 28\% of the diameter of the metric
space. Moreover, the mapping $\psi$ assigning each three-dimensional copula its unique partial
vine copula turns out to be discontinuous with respect to $d_\infty$ (but continuous with respect
to $D_1$ and to weak conditional convergence), implying a surprising sensitivity of partial vine
copula approximations. The afore-mentioned main results concerning $d_\infty$ are then extended
to the general multivariate setting.

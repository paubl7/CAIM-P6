Carlitz [2] initiated a study on degenerate versions of Bernoulli and Euler numbers which has been
extended recently to the researches on various degenerate versions of quite a few special numbers
and polynomials. They have been explored by using several different tools including generating
functions, combinatorial methods, $p$-adic analysis, umbral calculus, special functions, differential
equations and probability theory as well. \par The degenerate Poisson random variables are degenerate
versions of the Poisson random variables. In [6], studied are the degenerate binomial and degenerate
Poisson random variables in relation to the degenerate Lah-Bell polynomials. Among other things,
it is shown that the rising factorial moments of the degenerate Poisson random variable are expressed
by the degenerate Lah-Bell polynomials. Also, it is shown that the probability-generating function
of the degenerate Poisson random variable is equal to the generating function of the degenerate
Lah-Bell polynomials. The zero-truncated Poisson distributions (also called the conditional
or the positive Poisson distributions) are certain discrete probability distributions whose
supports are the set of positive integers. In [10], the zero-truncated degenerate Poisson random
variables, whose probability mass functions are a natural extension of the zero-truncated Poisson
random variables, are introduced and various properties of those random variables are investigated.
Specifically, for those distributions, studied are its expectation, its variance, its n-th moment,
its cumulative distribution function and certain expressions for the probability function of
a finite sum of independent degenerate zero-truncated Poisson random variables with equal and
unequal parameters.

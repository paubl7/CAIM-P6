In this paper, important concepts from finite group theory are translated to localities, in particular
to linking localities. Here localities are group-like structures associated to fusion systems
which were introduced by Chermak. Linking localities (by Chermak also called proper localities)
are special kinds of localities which correspond to linking systems; thus they contain the algebraic
information that is needed to study $p$-completed classifying spaces of fusion systems as generalizations
of $p$-completed classifying spaces of finite groups. Because of the group-like nature of localities,
there is a natural notion of partial normal subgroups. Given a locality $\mathcal{L}$ and a partial
normal subgroup $\mathcal{N}$ of $\mathcal{L}$, we show that there is a largest partial normal
subgroup $\mathcal{N}^\perp$ of $\mathcal{L}$ which, in a certain sense, commutes elementwise
with $\mathcal{N}$ and thus morally plays the role of a ``centralizer'' of $\mathcal{N}$ in $\mathcal{L}$.
This leads to a nice notion of the generalized Fitting subgroup $F^*(\mathcal{L})$ of a linking
locality $\mathcal{L}$. Building on these results we define and study special kinds of linking
localities called regular localities. It turns out that there is a theory of components of regular
localities akin to the theory of components of finite groups. The main concepts we introduce and
work with in the present paper (in particular $\mathcal{N}^\perp$ in the special case of linking
localities, $F^*(\mathcal{L})$, regular localities and components of regular localities) were
already introduced and studied in a preprint by Chermak. However, we give a different and self-contained
approach to the subject where we reprove Chermak's theorems and also show several new results.

Numerical simulations of flow and transport in porous media usually rely on hybrid-dimensional
models, i.e., the fracture is considered as objects of a lower dimension compared to the embedding
matrix. Such models are usually combined with non-conforming discretizations as they avoid the
inherent difficulties associated with the generation of meshes that explicitly resolve fractures-matrix
interfaces. However, non-conforming discretizations demand a more complicated coupling of different
sub-models and may require special care to ensure conservative fluxes. We propose a novel approach
for the simulation of flow and transport problems in fractured porous media based on an equi-dimensional
representation of the fractures. The major challenge for these types of representation is the creation
of meshes which resolve the several complex interfaces between the fractures and the embedding
matrix. To overcome this difficulty, we employ a strategy based on adaptive mesh refinement (AMR).
The idea at the base of the proposed AMR is to start from an initially uniform coarse mesh and refine
the elements which have non-empty overlaps with at least one of the fractures. Iterating this process
allows to create non-uniform non-conforming meshes, which do not resolve the interfaces but can
approximate them with arbitrary accuracy. We demonstrate that low-order finite element (FE) discretizations
on adapted meshes are globally and locally conservative and we suitably adapt an algebraic flux
correction technique to ensure the discrete maximum principle. In particular, we show that the
notorious conditions on M-matrices have to be adapted to the basis functions defined on non-conforming
meshes. Although the proposed applications come from geophysical applications, the obtained
results could be applied to any diffusion and transport problems, on both conforming and non-conforming
meshes.

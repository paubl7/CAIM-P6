Locally convex (or nondegenerate) curves in the sphere (or projective space) have been studied
for several reasons, including the study of linear ordinary differential equations. Taking Frenet
frames allows us to translate such curves into corresponding curves in the flag space, the orthogonal
group or its cover $Spin_{n+1}$. Determining the homotopy type of the space of such closed curves
or, more generally, of spaces of such curves with prescribed initial and final jets appears to be
a hard problem, which has been solved for $n=2$ but otherwise remains open. This paper is a step towards
solving the problem for larger values of $n$. In the process, we prove a related conjecture of B. Shapiro
and M. Shapiro. We define the itinerary of a locally convex curve $\Gamma:[0,1]\to Spin_{n+1}$
as a word $w$ in the alphabet of non-trivial permutations. This word encodes the succession of non-open
Bruhat cells of $Spin_{n+1}$ pierced by $\Gamma$. We prove that, for each word $w$, the subspace
of curves of itinerary $w$ is an embedded contractible (topological) submanifold of finite codimension,
thus defining a stratification of the space of curves. We show how to obtain explicit (topologically)
transversal sections for each of these submanifolds. We study both a space of curves with minimum
regularity hypotheses, where only topological transversality applies, and spaces of sufficiently
regular curves. In both cases we study the neighboring relation between strata. This is an important
step in the construction of CW cell complexes mapped into the original space of curves by weak homotopy
equivalences. Our stratification is not as nice as might be desired, lacking for instance the Whitney
property. The differentiability class of the curves affect some properties of the stratification.
The necessary ingredients for the construction of a dual CW complex are proved.

(Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not
be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study a focusing $\Phi^4_3$-model with a Hartree-type
nonlinearity, where the potential for the Hartree nonlinearity is given by the Bessel potential
of order $\beta$. We first construct the focusing Gibbs measure for $\beta > 2$. We also show that
the threshold $\beta = 2$ is sharp in the sense that the associated Gibbs measure is not normalizable
for $\beta < 2$. Furthermore, we prove the following dichotomy at the critical value $\beta = 2$:
normalizability in the weakly nonlinear regime and non-normalizability in the strongly nonlinear
regime. We then study the three-dimensional stochastic damped nonlinear wave equation (SdNLW)
with a cubic Hartree nonlinearity, forced by an additive space-time white noise. Using ideas from
paracontrolled calculus, we rewrite the equation into a system of three unknowns and prove its local
well-posedness. We then establish almost sure global well-posedness and invariance of the focusing
Gibbs measure via Bourgain's invariant measure argument. In view of the non-normalizability result,
our almost sure global well-posedness result is sharp. In Appendix, we also consider the (parabolic)
stochastic quantization for the focusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure and construct global-in-time
invariant dynamics for the same range of $\beta$. We also consider the defocusing case. By introducing
further renormalizations at $\beta = 1$ and $\beta = \frac 12$, we extend the construction of the
defocusing Hartree $\Phi^4_3$-measure for $\beta > 0$, where the resulting measure is shown to
be singular with respect to the reference Gaussian free field for $0 < \beta \le \frac 12$. The dynamical
problem is studied only for $\beta > 1$ in the defocusing case.

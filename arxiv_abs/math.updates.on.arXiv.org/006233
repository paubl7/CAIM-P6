We study the band structure of self-adjoint elliptic operators $\mathbb{A}_g= -\nabla \cdot \sigma_{g}
\nabla$, where $\sigma_g$ has the symmetries of a honeycomb tiling of $\mathbb{R}^2$. We focus
on the case where $\sigma_{g}$ is a real-valued scalar: $\sigma_{g}=1$ within identical, disjoint
and "inclusions", centered at vertices of a honeycomb lattice, and $\sigma_{g}=g \gg1 $ (high contrast)
in the complement of the inclusion set (bulk). Such operators govern, e.g. transverse electric
(TE) modes in photonic crystal media consisting of high dielectric constant inclusions (semi-conductor
pillars) within a homogeneous lower contrast bulk (air), a configuration in physical studies.
Our approach, which is based on monotonicity properties of the associated energy form, extends
to a class of high contrast elliptic operators that model heterogeneous and anisotropic honeycomb
media. Our results concern the global behavior of dispersion surfaces, and the existence of conical
crossings (Dirac points) occurring in the lowest two energy bands as well as in bands arbitrarily
high in the spectrum. Dirac points are the source of important phenomena in fundamental and applied
physics, e.g. graphene and its artificial analogues, and topological insulators. The key hypotheses
are the non-vanishing of the Dirac (Fermi) velocity $v_D(g)$, verified numerically, and a spectral
isolation condition, verified analytically in many configurations. Asymptotic expansions,
to any order in $g^{-1}$, of Dirac point eigenpairs and $v_D(g)$ are derived with error bounds. Our
study illuminates differences between the high contrast behavior of $\mathbb{A}_g$ and the corresponding
strong binding regime for Schroedinger operators.

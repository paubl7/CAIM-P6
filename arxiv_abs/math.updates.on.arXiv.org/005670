We address the aircraft conflict resolution problem under trajectory prediction uncertainty.
We consider that aircraft velocity vectors may be perturbed due to weather effects, such as wind,
or measurement errors. Such perturbations may affect aircraft trajectory prediction which plays
a key role in ensuring flight safety in air traffic control. Our goal is to solve the aircraft conflict
resolution problem in the presence of such perturbations and guarantee that aircraft are separated
for any realization of the uncertain data. We propose an uncertainty model wherein aircraft velocities
are represented as random variables and the uncertainty set is assumed to be polyhedral. We consider
a robust optimization approach and embed the proposed uncertainty model within state-of-the-art
mathematical programming formulations for aircraft conflict resolution. We then adopt the approach
of Bertsimas and Sim (2004) to formulate the robust counterpart. We use the complex number reformulation
and the constraint generation algorithm proposed by Dias et al. (2020a) to solve the resulting nonconvex
optimization problem on benchmarking instances of the literature. Our numerical experiments
reveal that perturbations of the order of $\pm 5\%$ on aircraft velocities can be accounted for without
significantly impacting the objective function compared to the deterministic case. Our tests
also show that for greater levels of uncertainty, several instances fail to admit conflict-free
solutions, thus highlighting existing risk factors in aircraft conflict resolution. We attempt
to explain this behavior by further analyzing pre- and post-optimization aircraft trajectories.
Our findings show that most infeasible instances have both a relatively low total aircraft pairwise
minimal distance and a high number of conflicts.

In this thesis, we investigate the low-energy expansion of scattering amplitudes of closed strings
at one-loop level (i.e. at genus one) in a ten-dimensional Minkowski background using a special
class of functions called modular graph forms. These allow for a systematic evaluation of the low-energy
expansion and satisfy many non-trivial algebraic and differential relations. We study these relations
in detail, leading to basis decompositions for a large number of modular graph forms which greatly
reduce the complexity of the expansions of the integrals appearing in the amplitude. One of the results
of this thesis is a Mathematica package which automatizes these simplifications. We use these techniques
to compute the leading low-energy orders of the scattering amplitude of four gluons in the heterotic
string at one-loop level. Furthermore, we study a generating function which conjecturally contains
the torus integrals of all perturbative closed-string theories. We write this generating function
in terms of iterated integrals of holomorphic Eisenstein series and use this approach to arrive
at a more rigorous characterization of the space of modular graph forms than was possible before.
For tree-level string amplitudes, the single-valued map of multiple zeta values maps open-string
amplitudes to closed-string amplitudes. The definition of a suitable one-loop generalization,
a so-called elliptic single-valued map, is an active area of research and we provide a new perspective
on this topic using our generating function of torus integrals. The original version of this thesis,
as submitted in June 2020 to the Humboldt University Berlin, is available under the DOI 10.18452/21829.
The present text contains minor updates compared to this version, reflecting further developments
in the literature, in particular concerning the construction of an elliptic single-valued map.

In this article, the phenomenon of delayed Hopf bifurcations (DHB) in reaction-diffusion PDEs
is analyzed in the cubic Complex Ginzburg-Landau equation with a slowly-varying parameter. We
use the classical asymptotic methods of stationary phase and steepest descents to show that solutions
which approach the attracting quasi-steady state (QSS) before the Hopf bifurcation remain near
that state for long times after the Hopf bifurcation and the QSS has become repelling. In the complex
time plane, the phase function of the linear PDE has a saddle point, and the Stokes and anti-Stokes
lines are central to the asymptotics. The nonlinear terms are treated by applying an iterative method
to the mild form of the PDE given by perturbations about the linear particular solution. This tracks
the closeness of solutions near the attracting and repelling QSS. Next, we show that beyond a key
Stokes line through the saddle there is a space-time buffer curve along which the particular solution
of the linear PDE ceases to be exponentially small, causing the solution of the nonlinear PDE to diverge
from the repelling QSS and exhibit large-amplitude oscillations. The homogeneous solution also
stops being exponentially small in a spatially dependent manner, as determined also by the initial
time. We find four different cases of DHB, depending on the competition between the homogeneous
and particular solutions, and we quantify how these depend on system parameters. Examples are presented
for each case, with uni-modal, spatially-periodic, smooth step, and algebraically-growing source
terms. Also, rich spatio-temporal dynamics are observed in the post-DHB oscillations. Finally,
it is shown that large-amplitude source terms can be designed so that solutions spend substantially
longer times near the repelling QSS, and hence region-specific control over the delayed onset of
oscillations can be achieved.

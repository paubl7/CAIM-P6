The characterization of intermittency in turbulence has its roots in the K62 theory, and if no proper
definition is to be found in the literature, statistical properties of intermittency were studied
and models were developed in attempt to reproduce it. The first contribution of this work is to propose
a requirement list to be satisfied by models designed within the Lagrangian framework. Multifractal
stochastic processes are a natural choice to retrieve multifractal properties of the dissipation.
Among them, following the proposition of \cite{Mandelbrot1968}, we investigate the Gaussian
Multiplicative Chaos formalism, which requires the construction of a log-correlated stochastic
process $X_t$. The fractional Gaussian noise of Hurst parameter $H = 0$ is of great interest because
it leads to a log-correlation for the logarithm of the process.Inspired by the approximation of
fractional Brownian motion by an infinite weighted sum of correlated Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes,
our second contribution is to propose a new stochastic model: $X_t = \int_0^\infty Y_t^x k(x) d x$,
where $Y_t^x$ is an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with speed of mean reversion $x$ and $k$ is a kernel.
A regularization of $k(x)$ is required to ensure stationarity, finite variance and logarithmic
auto-correlation. A variety of regularizations are conceivable, and we show that they lead to the
aforementioned multifractal models.To simulate the process, we eventually design a new approach
relying on a limited number of modes for approximating the integral through a quadrature $X_t^N
= \sum_{i=1}^N \omega_i Y_t^{x_i}$, using a conventional quadrature method. This method can retrieve
the expected behavior with only one mode per decade, making this strategy versatile and computationally
attractive for simulating such processes, while remaining within the proposed framework for a
proper description of intermittency.

This paper introduces an efficient algorithm for the sequential positioning (or nested dissection)
of two planar interfaces in an arbitrary polyhedron, such that, after each truncation, the respectively
remaining polyhedron admits a prescribed volume. This task, among others, is frequently encountered
in the numerical simulation of three-phase flows when resorting to the geometric Volume-of-Fluid
method. For two-phase flows, the recent work of Kromer and Bothe (arXiv:2101.03861) addresses
the positioning of a single plane by combining an implicit bracketing of the sought position with
up to third-order derivatives of the volume fraction. An analogous application of their highly
efficient root-finding scheme to three-material configurations requires computing the volume
of a twice truncated arbitrary polyhedron. The present manuscript achieves this by recursive application
of the Gaussian divergence theorem in appropriate form, which allows to compute the volume as a sum
of quantities associated to the faces of the original polyhedron. With a suitable choice of the coordinate
origin, accounting for the sequential character of the truncation, the volume parametrization
becomes co-moving with respect to the planes. This eliminates the necessity to establish topological
connectivity and tetrahedron decomposition after each truncation. After a detailed mathematical
description of the concept, we conduct a series of carefully designed numerical experiments to
assess the performance in terms of polyhedron truncations. The high efficiency of the two-phase
positioning persists for sequential application, thereby being robust with respect to input data
and possible intersection topologies. In comparison to an existing decomposition-based approach,
the number of truncations was reduced by up to an order of magnitude, further highlighting the superiority
of the divergence-based volume computation.

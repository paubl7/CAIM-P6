This paper studies how to integrate rider mode preferences into the design of On-Demand Multimodal
Transit Systems (ODMTS). It is motivated by a common worry in transit agencies that an ODMTS may be
poorly designed if the latent demand, i.e., new riders adopting the system, is not captured. The
paper proposes a bilevel optimization model to address this challenge, in which the leader problem
determines the ODMTS design, and the follower problems identify the most cost efficient and convenient
route for riders under the chosen design. The leader model contains a choice model for every potential
rider that determines whether the rider adopts the ODMTS given her proposed route. To solve the bilevel
optimization model, the paper proposes an exact decomposition method that includes Benders optimal
cuts and nogood cuts to ensure the consistency of the rider choices in the leader and follower problems.
Moreover, to improve computational efficiency, the paper proposes upper bounds on trip durations
for the follower problems and valid inequalities that strenghten the nogood cuts. The proposed
method is validated using an extensive computational study on a real data set from AAATA, the transit
agency for the broader Ann Arbor and Ypsilanti region in Michigan. The study considers the impact
of a number of factors, including the price of on-demand shuttles, the number of hubs, and accessibility
criteria. The designed ODMTS feature high adoption rates and significantly shorter trip durations
compared to the existing transit system and highlight the benefits in accessibility for low-income
riders. Finally, the computational study demonstrates the efficiency of the decomposition method
for the case study and the benefits of computational enhancements that improve the baseline method
by several orders of magnitude.

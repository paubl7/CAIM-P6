In this short paper, we extend the concept of the strict order polynomial $\Omega_{P}^{\circ}(n)$,
which enumerates the number of strict order-preserving maps $\phi:P\rightarrow\boldsymbol{n}$
for a poset $P$, to the extended strict order polynomial $\text{E}_{P}^{\circ}(n,z)$, which enumerates
analogous maps for the elements of the power set $\mathcal{P}(P)$. The problem at hand immediately
reduces to the problem of enumeration of linear extensions for the subposets of $P$. We show that
for every $Q\subset P$ a given linear extension $v$ of $Q$ can be associated with a unique linear extension
$w$ of $P$. The number of such linear extensions $v$ (of length $k$) associated with a given linear
extension $w$ of $P$ can be expressed compactly as $\binom{\text{del}_{P}(w)}{k}$, where $\text{del}_{P}(w)$
is the number of deletable elements of $w$ defined in the text. Consequently the extended strict
order polynomial $\text{E}_{P}^{\circ}(n,z)$ can be represented as $ \text{E}_{P}^{\circ}(n,z)=\sum_{w\in\mathcal{L}(P)}\sum_{k=0}^{p}\binom{\text{del}_{P}(w)}{p-k}\binom{n+\text{des}(w)}{k}z^{k}$.
The derived equation can be used for example for solving the following combinatorial problem: Consider
a community of $p$ shepherds, some of whom are connected by a master-apprentice relation (expressed
as a poset $P$). Every morning, $k$ of the shepherds go out and each of them herds a flock of sheep. Community
tradition stipulates that each of these $k$ shepherds will herd at least one and at most $n$ sheep,
and an apprentice will always herd fewer sheep than his master (or his master's master, etc). In how
many ways can the flocks be formed? The strict order polynomial answers this question for the case
in which all $p$ shepherds go to work, and the extended strict order polynomial considers also all
the situations in which some of the shepherds decide to take a day off.

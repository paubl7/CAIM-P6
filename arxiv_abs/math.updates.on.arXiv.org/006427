Given a set $A$ consisting of positive integers $a_1<a_2<\cdots<a_k$ and a $k$-term partition
$P:n_1+\cdots+n_k=n$, find the extremal denominators of the regular and semi-regular continued
fraction $[0;x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ with partial quotients $x_i\in A$, where each $a_i$ occurs precisely
$n_i$ times in the sequence $x_1,\ldots,x_n$. In 1983, G. Ramharter gave an explicit description
of the extremal arrangements of the regular continued fraction and the minimizing arrangement
for the semi-regular continued fraction and showed that in each case the arrangement is unique up
to reversal and independent of the actual values of the positive integers $a_i$. However, the determination
of the maximizing arrangement for the semi-regular continuant turned out to be more difficult.
He showed that if $|A|=2$ then the maximizing arrangement is unique (up to reversal) and depends
only on the partition $P$ and not on the values of the $a_i$. He further conjectured that this should
be true for general $A$ with $|A|\geq 2.$ In this paper we confirm Ramharter's conjecture for sets
$A$ with $|A|=3$ and give an algorithmic procedure for constructing the maximizing arrangement.
We also show that Ramharter's conjecture fails in general for $|A|\geq 4$ in that the maximizing
arrangement is neither unique nor independent of the values of the digits in $A$. The central idea,
as discovered by Ramharter, is that the extremal arrangements satisfy a strong combinatorial condition.
In the context of bi-infinite binary words, this condition coincides with the Markoff property,
discovered by A.A. Markoff in 1879 in his study of minima of binary quadratic forms. We show that this
same combinatorial condition, in the framework of infinite words over a $k$-letter alphabet, is
the characterizing property which describes the orbit structure of codings of points under a symmetric
$k$-interval exchange transformation.

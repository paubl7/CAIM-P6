Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has recently appeared as a powerful and robust multiple
access and interference management strategy for downlink Multi-user (MU) multi-antenna communications.
In this work, we study the precoder design problem for RSMA scheme in downlink MU systems with both
perfect and imperfect Channel State Information at the Transmitter (CSIT) and assess the role and
benefits of transmitting multiple common streams. Unlike existing works which have considered
single-antenna receivers (Multiple-Input Single-Output--MISO), we propose and extend the RSMA
framework for multi-antenna receivers (Multiple-Input Multiple-Output--MIMO) and formulate
the precoder optimization problem with the aim of maximizing the Weighted Ergodic Sum-Rate (WESR).
Precoder optimization is solved using Sample Average Approximation (SAA) together with the proposed
vectorization and Weighted Minimum Mean Square Error (WMMSE) based approach. Achievable sum-Degree
of Freedom (DoF) of RSMA is derived for the proposed framework as an increasing function of the number
of transmitted common and private streams, which is further validated by the Ergodic Sum Rate (ESR)
performance using Monte Carlo simulations. Conventional MU-MIMO based on linear precoders and
Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) schemes are considered as baselines. Numerical results
show that with imperfect CSIT, the sum-DoF and ESR performance of RSMA is superior than that of the
two baselines, and is increasing with the number of transmitted common streams. Moreover, by better
managing the interference, RSMA not only has significant ESR gains over baseline schemes but is
more robust to CSIT inaccuracies, network loads and user deployments.

Hybrid vibro-impact (HVI) oscillations is a strongly nonlinear dynamical regime that involves
both linear oscillations and collisions under periodic, impulsive, or stochastic excitation.
This regime arises in various engineering systems, such as mechanical components under tight rigid
constraints, seismic-induced sloshing in partially-filled liquid storage tanks, and more. The
adaptive nonlinearity of the HVI oscillator is used by the HVI-nonlinear energy sink as an effective
vibration mitigation solution for broad energy and frequency range. Due to the extreme nonlinearity
of this regime, traditional analytical methods are inapplicable for the description of its transient
dynamics. In the current work, we model the HVI oscillator by a forced particle in a truncated quadratic
potential well with infinite depth. The slow flow dynamics of the system in the vicinity of primary
resonance is described by canonical transformation to action-angle (AA) variables and the corresponding
reduced resonance manifold (RM). Two types of bifurcation are examined. The former is associated
with the transition between linear oscillations and the HVI-regime and vice versa, and the latter
with reaching a chosen maximal transient energy level. The transition boundaries and frequency
response curves are obtained analytically. Two underlying dynamical mechanisms that govern the
occurrence of bifurcations are identified: the "maximum" and the "saddle" mechanisms. The latter,
a potentially more dangerous scenario, involves abrupt transitions of the system's energy response
from a relatively small value to the threshold energy level. Both mechanisms are universal for systems
that undergo escape from a potential well. All theoretical results are in complete agreement with
full-scale numerical simulations.

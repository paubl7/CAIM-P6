Max-point-tolerance graphs (MPTG) were studied by Catanzaro et al. in 2017 and the same class of
graphs were introduced in the name of p-BOX(1) graphs by Soto and Caro in 2015. In our paper we consider
central-max-point tolerance graphs (central MPTG) by taking the points of MPTG as center points
of their corresponding intervals. In course of study on this class of graphs we show that the class
of central MPTG is same as the class of unit max-tolerance graphs. We prove the class of unit central
max-point tolerance graphs is same as that of proper central max-point tolerance graphs and both
of them are equivalent to the class of proper interval graphs. Next we introduce 50% max-tolerance
graphs and separate this class from unit max-tolerance graph whereas for min-tolerance graphs
50% and unit denote the same graph class. Interval catch digraphs (ICD) was introduced by Maehera
in 1984. In his introducing paper Maehera proposed a conjecture for the characterization of central
interval catch digraph (central ICD) in terms of forbidden subdigraphs. In this paper, we disprove
the conjecture by showing counter examples. We find close relation between a central MPTG and a central
ICD. Also we characterize this digraph by defining a suitable mapping from the vertex set to the real
line. Next we study oriented interval catch digraphs (oriented ICD). We characterize augmented
adjacency matrix of an oriented ICD when it is a tournament. Also we characterize an oriented ICD
whose underlying graph is a tree. Further we obtain characterization of the adjacency matrix of
a proper interval catch digraph. Another important result is to provide forbidden subdigraph characterization
of those proper oriented interval catch digraphs whose underlying undirected graph is chordal.
In last section we discuss relationships between these classes of graphs and digraphs.

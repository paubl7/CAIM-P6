This paper investigates the effect of malicious intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) in a massive
MIMO uplink.The IRSs are used by malicious users (MUs) for randomly reflecting pilot and data sequences
of legitimate users (LUs) to a base station (BS), we consider the problem of channel estimation and
signal extraction in the presence of the malicious IRSs. Firstly, we find that by using the IRSs,
the reflected sequences are correlative to the data sequences of LUs. This correlation challenges
traditional channel estimation techniques. To be more precisely, we prove that the right singular
matrix of a received signal at the BS is a function of the correlation between the legitimate and reflection
data in a large-scale antenna regime. As a result, the correlation caused by malicious IRSs degrades
the performance of traditional channel estimation methods based on eigenvalue decomposition
(EVD) of the received signals. To address this challenge, we propose a signal extraction and channel
estimation method to combat malicious IRSs. More precisely, geometric arguments, such as convex
hulls of extracted signals exhibit insensitive to the correlation. The convex hulls are thus utilized
to provide signal extraction and channel estimation criteria. To optimize these criteria, we develop
an extractor that can capture the convex hulls of desired signals from noisy signals. Based on this,
we formulate two optimization problems, whose global minima are solved to perform signal extraction
and channel estimation. Experimental results show that when the IRSs randomly flop reflection
phases with probability of 0.8, the proposed method outperforms the EVD-based method by more than
5 dB in the sense of normalized mean square error (NMSE).

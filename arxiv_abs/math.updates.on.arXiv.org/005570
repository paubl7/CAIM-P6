This paper presents the first classical Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that can be applied
directly to data from unstructured finite element meshes or control volume grids. CNNs have been
hugely influential in the areas of image classification and image compression, both of which typically
deal with data on structured grids. Unstructured meshes are frequently used to solve partial differential
equations and are particularly suitable for problems that require the mesh to conform to complex
geometries or for problems that require variable mesh resolution. Central to the approach are space-filling
curves, which traverse the nodes or cells of a mesh tracing out a path that is as short as possible (in
terms of numbers of edges) and that visits each node or cell exactly once. The space-filling curves
(SFCs) are used to find an ordering of the nodes or cells that can transform multi-dimensional solutions
on unstructured meshes into a one-dimensional (1D) representation, to which 1D convolutional
layers can then be applied. Although developed in two dimensions, the approach is applicable to
higher dimensional problems. To demonstrate the approach, the network we choose is a convolutional
autoencoder (CAE) although other types of CNN could be used. The approach is tested by applying CAEs
to data sets that have been reordered with an SFC. Sparse layers are used at the input and output of
the autoencoder, and the use of multiple SFCs is explored. We compare the accuracy of the SFC-based
CAE with that of a classical CAE applied to two idealised problems on structured meshes, and then
apply the approach to solutions of flow past a cylinder obtained using the finite-element method
and an unstructured mesh.

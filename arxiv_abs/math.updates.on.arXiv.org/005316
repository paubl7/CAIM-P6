Aldous, Evans and Pitman (1998) studied the behavior of the fragmentation process derived from
deleting the edges of a uniform random tree on $n$ labelled vertices. In particular, they showed
that, after proper rescaling, the above fragmentation process converges as $n \rightarrow \infty$
to the fragmentation process of the Brownian CRT obtained by cutting-down the Brownian CRT along
its skeleton in a Poisson manner. Aldous and Pitman (1998) also showed that this latter is connected
to the standard additive coalescent via a deterministic time-change. In this work, we continue
the above investigation and study the fragmentation process obtained by deleting randomly chosen
edges from a critical Galton-Watson tree $\mathbf{t}_{n}$ conditioned on having $n$ vertices,
whose offspring distribution belongs to the domain of attraction of a stable law of index $\alpha
\in (1,2]$. Our main results establish that, after rescaling, the fragmentation process of $\mathbf{t}_{n}$
converges as $n \rightarrow \infty$ to the fragmentation process obtained by cutting-down proportional
to the length on the skeleton of an $\alpha$-stable L\'evy tree of index $\alpha \in (1,2]$. We further
show that the fragmentation process of the $\alpha$-stable L\'evy tree can be constructed by considering
the partitions of the unit interval induced by the normalized $\alpha$-stable L\'evy excursion
with a deterministic drift studied by Miermont (2001), which extends the result of Bertoin (2000)
on the fragmentation process of the Brownian CRT. In particular, this implies that the fragmentation
of the $\alpha$-stable L\'evy tree can also be obtained as mixing of time-reversed extremal additive
coalescents in analogy with the work of Aldous and Pitman (2000).

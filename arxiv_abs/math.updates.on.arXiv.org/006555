Let $\psi:{\mathcal{D}}\rightarrow{\mathbf{R}}$ be a harmonic function such that $\Delta\psi(x)=0$
for all $x\in\mathcal{D}\subset{\mathbf{R}}^{n}$. There are then many well-established classical
results:the Dirichlet problem and Poisson formula, Harnack inequality, the Maximum Principle,
the Mean Value Property etc. Here, a 'noisy' or random domain is one for which there also exists a classical
scalar Gaussian random field (GRF) ${\mathscr{J}(x)}$ defined for all $x\in{\mathcal{D}}$ or
$x\in\partial {\mathcal{D}}$ with respect to a probability space $[\Omega,\mathcal{F},{\mathrm{I\!P}}]$.
The GRF has vanishing mean value $\mathbf{E}[\![\mathscr{J}(x)]\!] = 0$ and a regulated covariance
${{\mathbf{E}}}[\![{{\mathscr{J}}(x)} \otimes {{\mathscr{J}}(y)}]\!] = \alpha J(x,y;\xi)$
for all $(x,y)\in{\mathcal{D}}$ and/or $(x,y)\in{\partial\mathcal{D}}$, with correlation
length $\xi$ and ${{\mathbf{E}}}[\![{{\mathscr{J}}(x)} \otimes {{\mathscr{J}}}(x)]\!] =
\alpha<\infty$. The gradient $\nabla{{\mathscr{J}}(x)}$ and integral $\int_{{\mathcal{D}}}{\mathscr{J}}(x)
d\mu(x)$ also exist on ${\mathcal{D}}\bigcup\partial\mathcal{D}$. Harmonic functions and
potentials can become randomly perturbed GRFs of the form $\overline{\psi(x)}=\psi(x)+\lambda{{\mathscr{J}}}(x)$.
Physically, this scenario arises from noisy sources or random fluctuations in mass/charge density,
noisy or random boundary/surface data; and introducing turbulence/randomness into smooth fluid
flows, steady state diffusions or heat flow. This leads to stochastic modifications of classical
theorems for randomly perturbed harmonic functions and Riesz and Newtonian potentials; and to
stability estimates and bounds for the growth and decay of their volatility and moments.

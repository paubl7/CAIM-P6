We investigate the chaotic behaviour of multiparticle systems, in particular DNA and graphene
models, by applying methods of nonlinear dynamics. Using symplectic integration techniques,
we present an extensive analysis of chaos in the Peyrard-Bishop-Dauxois (PBD) model of DNA. The
chaoticity is quantified by the maximum Lyapunov exponent (mLE) across a spectrum of temperatures,
and the effect of base pair (BP) disorder on the dynamics is studied. In addition to heterogeneity
due to the ratio of adenine-thymine (AT) and guanine-cytosine (GC) BPs, the distribution of BPs
in the sequence is analysed by introducing the alternation index $\alpha$. An exact probability
distribution for BP arrangements and $\alpha$ is derived using P\'olya counting. The value of the
mLE depends on the composition and arrangement of BPs in the strand, with a dependence on temperature.
We probe regions of strong chaoticity using the deviation vector distribution, studying links
between strongly nonlinear behaviour and the formation of bubbles. Randomly generated sequences
and biological promoters are both studied. Further, properties of bubbles are analysed through
molecular dynamics simulations. The distributions of bubble lifetimes and lengths are obtained,
fitted with analytical expressions, and a physically justified threshold for considering a BP
to be open is successfully implemented. In addition to DNA, we present analysis of the dynamical
stability of a planar model of graphene, studying the mLE in bulk graphene as well as in graphene nanoribbons
(GNRs). The stability of the material manifests in a very small mLE, with chaos being a slow process
in graphene. For both armchair and zigzag edge GNRs, the mLE decreases with increasing width, asymptotically
reaching the bulk behaviour. This dependence of the mLE on both energy density and ribbon width is
fitted accurately with empirical expressions.

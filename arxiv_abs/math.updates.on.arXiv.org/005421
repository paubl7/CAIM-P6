The present paper provides a solution in the affirmative to a recognized open problem in the theory
of uniform stabilization of 3-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in the vicinity of an unstable
equilibrium solution, by means of a `minimal' and `least' invasive feedback strategy which consists
of a control pair $\{ v,u \}$ \cite{LT2:2015}. Here $v$ is a tangential boundary feedback control,
acting on an arbitrary small part $\widetilde{\Gamma}$ of the boundary $\Gamma$; while $u$ is a
localized, interior feedback control, acting tangentially on an arbitrarily small subset $\omega$
of the interior supported by $\widetilde{\Gamma}$. The ideal strategy of taking $u = 0$ on $\omega$
is not sufficient. A question left open in the literature was: Can such feedback control $v$ of the
pair $\{ v, u \}$ be asserted to be finite dimensional also in the dimension $d = 3$? We here give an affirmative
answer to this question, thus establishing an optimal result. To achieve the desired finite dimensionality
of the feedback tangential boundary control $v$, it is here then necessary to abandon the Hilbert
setting of past literature and replace it with a Besov setting which are `close' to $L^3(\Omega)$
for $d=3$. It is in line with recent critical well-posedness in the full space of the non-controlled
N-S equations. A key feature of such Besov spaces with tight indices is that they do not recognize
compatibility conditions. The proof is constructive and is "optimal" also regarding the "minimal"
number of tangential boundary controllers needed. The new setting requires establishing maximal
regularity in the required critical Besov setting for the overall closed-loop linearized problem
with tangential feedback control applied on the boundary. Finally, the minimal amount of tangential
boundary action is linked to the issue of unique continuation of over-determined Oseen eigenproblems.

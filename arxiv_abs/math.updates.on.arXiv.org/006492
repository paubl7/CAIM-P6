For any simply-laced type simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ and any height function $\xi$ adapted
to an orientation $Q$ of the Dynkin diagram of $\mathfrak{g}$, Hernandez-Leclerc introduced a
certain category $\mathcal{C}^{\leq \xi}$ of representations of the quantum affine algebra $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$,
as well as a subcategory $\mathcal{C}_Q$ of $\mathcal{C}^{\leq \xi}$ whose complexified Grothendieck
ring is isomorphic to the coordinate ring $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{N}]$ of a maximal unipotent subgroup.
In this paper, we define an algebraic morphism $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ on a torus $\mathcal{Y}^{\leq
\xi}$ containing the image of $K_0(\mathcal{C}^{\leq \xi})$ under the truncated $q$-character
morphism. We prove that the restriction of $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ to $K_0(\mathcal{C}_Q)$ coincides
with the morphism $\overline{D}$ recently introduced by Baumann-Kamnitzer-Knutson in their
study of equivariant multiplicities of Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen cycles. This is achieved using the
T-systems satisfied by the characters of Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules in $\mathcal{C}_Q$, as
well as certain results by Brundan-Kleshchev-McNamara on the representation theory of quiver
Hecke algebras. This alternative description of $\overline{D}$ allows us to prove a conjecture
by the first author on the distinguished values of $\overline{D}$ on the flag minors of $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{N}]$.
We also provide applications of our results from the perspective of Kang-Kashiwara-Kim-Oh's generalized
Schur-Weyl duality. Finally, we define a cluster algebra $\overline{\mathcal{A}}_Q$ as a subquotient
of $K_0(\mathcal{C}^{\leq \xi})$ naturally containing $\mathbb{C}[\mathbf{N}]$, and suggest
the existence of an analogue of the Mirkovi\'c-Vilonen basis in $\overline{\mathcal{A}}_Q$ on
which the values of $\widetilde{D}_{\xi}$ may be interpreted as certain equivariant multiplicities.

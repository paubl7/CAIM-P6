We analyse three time integration schemes for unfitted methods in fluid structure interaction.
In Alghorithm 1 we propose a fully discrete monolithic algorithm with P1 P1 stabilized finite elements
for the fluid problem; for this alghorithm we prove well-posedness, unconditional stability and
convergence in the case of linearized problem (see Propositions 2.4.2, 2.4.3 and Theorem 3.3.7,
respectively). The analysis optimal convergence rates as expected from the Euler scheme, and the
supposed regularity of the solution to the continuous problem. Moreover we introduce two algorithms
that allow for a partitioning of the coupled problem by exploiting an explicit-implicit treatment
of the transmission conditions. Algorithm 2 represents, essentially, a simplification of Algorithm
1 since it simply treat the solid elastic forces in explicit form using the displacement and velocities
of the structure evaluated in the previous time steps. Instead, Algorithm 3, is really a splitting
algorithm that involves the solution of two staggered problems. It splits the forces that solid
transfers to fluid in two contributions: the inertial contribution that is treated in implicit
form and the elastic contribution that is treated in explicit form. We perform the stability analysis
for both the schemes in Theorems 4.3.1 and 4.3.3. Algorithm 2 results conditionally stable for all
the extrapolations considered, instead Algorithm 3 is unconditionally stable, for extrapolations
of order zero and one, and conditionally stable for the extrapolation of order two. Since Algorithm
3 is the most promising, we perform the convergence analysis in the linearized case (see Theorem
4.4.2) obtaining results in line with those of the monolithic case, in particular the splitting
introduced preserves optimal conevegence rates.

For $(t,x) \in (0,\infty)\times\mathbb{T}^D$, the generalized Kasner solutions are a family
of explicit solutions to various Einstein-matter systems that start out smooth but then develop
a Big Bang singularity as $t \downarrow 0$, i.e., curvature blowup along a spacelike hypersurface.
The family is parameterized by the Kasner exponents $\widetilde{q}_1,\cdots,\widetilde{q}_D
\in \mathbb{R}$, which satisfy two algebraic constraints. There are heuristics in the mathematical
physics literature, going back more than 50 years, suggesting that the Big Bang formation should
be stable under perturbations of the Kasner initial data, given say at $\lbrace t = 1 \rbrace$, as
long as the exponents are "sub-critical" in the following sense: $\mathop{\max_{I,J,B=1,\cdots,D}}_{I
< J} \{\widetilde{q}_I+\widetilde{q}_J-\widetilde{q}_B\}<1$. Previous works have shown the
stability of the singularity under stronger assumptions: 1) the Einstein-scalar field system
with $D = 3$ and $\widetilde{q}_1 \approx \widetilde{q}_2 \approx \widetilde{q}_3 \approx 1/3$
or 2) the Einstein-vacuum equations for $D \geq 39$ with $\max_{I=1,\cdots,D} |\widetilde{q}_I|
< 1/6$. We prove that the Kasner singularity is dynamically stable for \emph{all} sub-critical
Kasner exponents, thereby justifying the heuristics in the full regime where stable monotonic-type
curvature blowup is expected. We treat the $1+D$-dimensional Einstein-scalar field system for
$D \geq3$ and the $1+D$ dimensional Einstein-vacuum equations for $D \geq 10$. Moreover, for the
Einstein-vacuum equations in $1+3$ dimensions, where instabilities are in general expected,
we prove that all singular Kasner solutions have stable Big Bangs under polarized $U(1)$-symmetric
perturbations of their initial data. Our results hold for open sets of initial data in Sobolev spaces
without symmetry, apart from our work on polarized $U(1)$-symmetric solutions.

In this paper, we study the dual of generalized bent functions $f: V_{n}\rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$
where $V_{n}$ is an $n$-dimensional vector space over $\mathbb{F}_{p}$ and $p$ is an odd prime,
$k$ is a positive integer. It is known that weakly regular generalized bent functions always appear
in pairs since the dual of a weakly regular generalized bent function is also a weakly regular generalized
bent function. The dual of non-weakly regular generalized bent functions can be generalized bent
or not generalized bent. By generalizing the construction of \cite{Cesmelioglu5}, we obtain an
explicit construction of generalized bent functions for which the dual can be generalized bent
or not generalized bent. We show that the generalized indirect sum construction method given in
\cite{Wang} can provide a secondary construction of generalized bent functions for which the dual
can be generalized bent or not generalized bent. By using the knowledge on ideal decomposition in
cyclotomic field, we prove that $f^{**}(x)=f(-x)$ if $f$ is a generalized bent function and its
dual $f^{*}$ is also a generalized bent function. For any non-weakly regular generalized bent function
$f$ which satisfies that $f(x)=f(-x)$ and its dual $f^{*}$ is generalized bent, we give a property
and as a consequence, we prove that there is no self-dual generalized bent function $f: V_{n}\rightarrow
\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$ if $p\equiv 3 \ (mod \ 4)$ and $n$ is odd. For $p \equiv 1 \ (mod \ 4)$ or $p\equiv 3
\ (mod \ 4)$ and $n$ is even, we give a secondary construction of self-dual generalized bent functions.
In the end, we characterize the relations between the generalized bentness of the dual of generalized
bent functions and the bentness of the dual of bent functions, as well as the self-duality relations
between generalized bent functions and bent functions by the decomposition of generalized bent
functions.

Scalar field cosmologies for Kantowski-Sachs (KS) and closed Friedmann-Lema\^itre-Robertson-Walker
(FLRW) metrics with generalized harmonic potential and matter with energy density $\rho_m$, pressure
$p_m$ and barotropic equation of state (EoS) $p_m=(\gamma-1)\rho_m$ where $\gamma\in[0,2]$
are investigated. Using methods from the theory of averaging of nonlinear dynamical systems it
is proved that solutions of full time-depending equations and their corresponding time-averaged
versions remain close as a time-dependent perturbation parameter $D$ is small. When $D$ becomes
monotonic increasing we define a regular dynamical system over a compact phase space; obtaining
global results. That is, for KS metric global late-time attractors of full and time-averaged systems
are: two anisotropic contracting solutions which are non-flat locally rotationally symmetric
(LRS) Kasner Bianchi I and Taub (flat LRS Kasner) for $0\leq \gamma<2$ and flat FLRW matter dominated
universe if $0\leq \gamma \leq \frac{2}{3}$. For closed FLRW metric late-time attractors of the
full and averaged systems are: a flat matter dominated FLRW universe for $0\leq \gamma \leq \frac{2}{3}$
as in KS and the Einstein-de-Sitter solution for $0\leq\gamma<1$. Therefore, the time-averaged
system determines future asymptotics of the full system and the oscillations entering the system
through Klein-Gordon (KG) equation can be controlled and smoothed out when $D$ goes monotonically
to zero, and incidentally, for the whole $D$-range for KS and for closed FLRW (if $0\leq \gamma\leq
1$) too. However, for $\gamma\geq 1$ closed FLRW's solutions of the full system depart from the solutions
of the averaged system as $D$ become large. Our results are supported by numerical simulations.

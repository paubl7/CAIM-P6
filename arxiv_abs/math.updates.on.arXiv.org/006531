We study two classes of operator algebras associated with a unital subsemigroup $P$ of a discrete
group $G$: one related to universal structures, and one related to co-universal structures. First
we provide connections between universal C*-algebras that arise variously from isometric representations
of $P$ that reflect the space $\mathcal{J}$ of constructible right ideals, from associated Fell
bundles, and from induced partial actions. This includes connections of appropriate quotients
with the strong covariance relations in the sense of Sehnem. We then pass to the reduced representation
$\mathrm{C}^*_\lambda(P)$ and we consider the boundary quotient $\partial \mathrm{C}^*_\lambda(P)$
related to the minimal boundary space. We show that $\partial \mathrm{C}^*_\lambda(P)$ is co-universal
in two different classes: (a) with respect to the equivariant constructible isometric representations
of $P$; and (b) with respect to the equivariant C*-covers of the reduced nonselfadjoint semigroup
algebra $\mathcal{A}(P)$. If $P$ is an Ore semigroup, or if $G$ acts topologically freely on the
minimal boundary space, then $\partial \mathrm{C}^*_\lambda(P)$ coincides with the usual C*-envelope
$\mathrm{C}^*_{\text{env}}(\mathcal{A}(P))$ in the sense of Arveson. This covers total orders,
finite type and right-angled Artin monoids, the Thompson monoid, multiplicative semigroups of
nonzero algebraic integers, and the $ax+b$-semigroups over integral domains that are not a field.
In particular, we show that $P$ is an Ore semigroup if and only if there exists a canonical $*$-isomorphism
from $\partial \mathrm{C}^*_\lambda(P)$, or from $\mathrm{C}^*_{\text{env}}(\mathcal{A}(P))$,
onto $\mathrm{C}^*_\lambda(G)$. If any of the above holds, then $\mathcal{A}(P)$ is shown to be
hyperrigid.

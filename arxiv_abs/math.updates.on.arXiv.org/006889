The study of intersection problems in Extremal Combinatorics dates back perhaps to 1938, when Paul
Erd\H{o}s, Chao Ko and Richard Rado proved the (first) `Erd\H{o}s-Ko-Rado theorem' on the maximum
possible size of an intersecting family of $k$-element subsets of a finite set. Since then, a plethora
of results of a similar flavour have been proved, for a range of different mathematical structures,
using a wide variety of different methods. Structures studied in this context have included families
of vector subspaces, families of graphs, subsets of finite groups with given group actions, and
of course uniform hypergraphs with stronger or weaker intersection conditions imposed. The methods
used have included purely combinatorial ones such as shifting/compressions, algebraic methods
(including linear-algebraic, Fourier analytic and representation-theoretic), and more recently,
analytic, probabilistic and regularity-type methods. As well as being natural problems in their
own right, intersection problems have connections with many other parts of Combinatorics and with
Theoretical Computer Science (and indeed with many other parts of Mathematics), both through the
results themselves, and the methods used. In this survey paper, we discuss both old and new results
(and both old and new methods), in the field of intersection problems. Many interesting open problems
remain; we will discuss several. For expositional and pedagogical purposes, we also take this opportunity
to give slightly streamlined versions of proofs (due to others) of several classical results in
the area. This survey is intended to be useful to PhD students, as well as to more established researchers.
It is a personal perspective on the field, and is not intended to be exhaustive; we apologise for any
omissions. It is an expanded version of a paper that will appear in the Proceedings of the 29th British
Combinatorial Conference.

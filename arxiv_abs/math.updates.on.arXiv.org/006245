In this paper, we consider the problem of restoring the correspondence matrix based on the observations
of real correspondences in Moscow. Following the conventional approach, the transport network
is considered as a directed graph whose edges correspond to road sections and the graph vertices
correspond to areas that the traffic participants leave or enter. The number of city residents is
considered constant. The problem of restoring the correspondence matrix is to calculate all the
correspondence from the $i$ area to the $j$ area. To restore the matrix, we propose to use one of the
most popular methods of calculating the correspondence matrix in urban studies -- the entropy model.
In our work, we describe the evolutionary justification of the entropy model and the main idea of
the transition to solving the problem of entropy-linear programming (ELP) in calculating the correspondence
matrix. To solve the ELP problem, it is proposed to pass to the dual problem. In this paper, we describe
several numerical optimization methods for solving this problem: the Sinkhorn method and the Accelerated
Sinkhorn method. We provide numerical experiments for the following variants of cost functions:
a linear cost function and a superposition of the power and logarithmic cost functions. In these
functions, the cost is a combination of average time and distance between areas, which depends on
the parameters. The correspondence matrix is calculated for multiple sets of parameters and then
we calculate the quality of the restored matrix relative to the known correspondence matrix. We
assume that the noise in the restored correspondence matrix is Gaussian, as a result, we use the standard
deviation as a quality metric.

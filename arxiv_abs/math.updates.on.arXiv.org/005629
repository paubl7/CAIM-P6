In many computational tasks and dynamical systems, asynchrony and randomization are naturally
present and have been considered as ways to increase the speed and reduce the cost of computation
while compromising the accuracy and convergence rate. In this work, we show the additional benefits
of randomization and asynchrony on the stability of linear dynamical systems. We introduce a natural
model for random asynchronous linear time-invariant (LTI) systems which generalizes the standard
(synchronous) LTI systems. In this model, each state variable is updated randomly and asynchronously
with some probability according to the underlying system dynamics. We examine how the mean-square
stability of random asynchronous LTI systems vary with respect to randomization and asynchrony.
Surprisingly, we show that the stability of random asynchronous LTI systems does not imply or is
not implied by the stability of the synchronous variant of the system and an unstable synchronous
system can be stabilized via randomization and/or asynchrony. We further study a special case of
the introduced model, namely randomized LTI systems, where each state element is updated randomly
with some fixed but unknown probability. We consider the problem of system identification of unknown
randomized LTI systems using the precise characterization of mean-square stability via extended
Lyapunov equation. For unknown randomized LTI systems, we propose a systematic identification
method to recover the underlying dynamics. Given a single input/output trajectory, our method
estimates the model parameters that govern the system dynamics, the update probability of state
variables, and the noise covariance using the correlation matrices of collected data and the extended
Lyapunov equation. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that the proposed method consistently
recovers the underlying system dynamics with the optimal rate.

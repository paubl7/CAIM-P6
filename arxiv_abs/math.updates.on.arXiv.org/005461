Here we consider the discrete time dynamics. As an example one can consider the transformation $T:M
\to M$, where $T=\sigma$ is the shift $M=\{1,2,...,d\}^\mathbb{N}$, It is known that the infinite
dimensional manifold $\mathcal{N}$ of H\"older equilibrium probabilities carries a natural
Riemannian metric. Given a certain normalized H\"older potential $A$ denote by $\mu_A \in \mathcal{N}$
the associated equilibrium probability. The set of tangent vectors $X$ (functions $X: M \to \mathbb{R}$)
to the manifold at the point $\mu_A$ (a subspace of the Hilbert space L^2(\mu_A)) coincides with
the kernel of the Ruelle operator for the normalized potential A. The Riemannian norm $|X|=|X|_A$
of the vector $X$, which is tangent to $\mathcal{N}$ at the point $\mu_A$, is described via the asymptotic
variance, that is, satisfies $$|X|^2\,\,= \,\,\langle X, X \rangle \,\,=\,\,\lim_{n \to \infty}
\frac{1}{n} \int (\sum_{i=0}^{n-1} X\circ T^i )^2 \,d \mu_A.$$ Consider an orthonormal basis
$X_i$, $i \in \mathbb{N}$, for the tangent space at $\mu_A$. Given two unitary tangent vectors $X$
and $Y$ the curvature $K(X,Y)$ satisfies K(X,Y) = 1 + \frac{1}{4}[\, \sum_{i=1}^\infty ( \int X
\,Y\, X_i \,d \mu_A)^2 - \sum_{i=1}^\infty \int X^2 X_i \,d \mu_A\, \,\int Y^2 X_i \,d \mu_A \,].
When the equilibrium probabilities \mu_A are invariant Markov probabilities on $\{0,1\}^\mathbb{N}$,
introducing a special orthonormal basis \hat{a}_y, indexed by finite words $y$, we shall get explicit
expressions for $K(\hat{a}_x,\hat{a}_z)$, which will be a finite sum. These values can be positive
or negative depending on $A$ and the words x and z. Words $x$ and z with large length can produce extremely
negative curvature K(\hat{a}_x,\hat{a}_z). If x and z do not share common words, then K(\hat{a}_x,\hat{a}_z)=1.

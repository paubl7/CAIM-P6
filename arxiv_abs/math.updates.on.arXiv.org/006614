I was asked to make my, by now quite old PhD thesis, available on the arxiv, for parts of it was never
submitted for publication. The thesis offers a systematic study of stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) on non-compact spaces. In particular we solve the open problem on strong completeness. An
SDE is strongly complete if its solution can be chosen to depend continuously in space and in time
for all time. The question is whether non-explosion, with possibly additional assumptions, implies
strong completeness. Strong completeness of an SDE implies that its solution depends continuously
on the initial condition, opening up possibility for numerical solutions, and the existence of
a perfect Cocycle (a basic assumption on random dynamical systems). This was known only for compact
manifolds and for linear state spaces, methods for either are not applicable to a general space.
We also obtain existence of the global smooth solution flow of SDEs on $R^n$ (sometimes allowing
substantial growth of the derivative of the coefficients, removing the global Lipschitz continuity
condition). Non-explosion, the $C_0$-property, and the derivative flow are studied. We showed
Bismut-Witten Laplacians are essentially self-adjojnt, paving the way for studying theirs semigroups
acting on functions and on differential forms. We relate the Markovian semi-group on differential
one forms with the semi-group $P_t$ on functions (inter-twining), find a method for proving path
integration formulas for $dP_tf$, path integration formula for semi-group on differential forms,
moment bounds for the derivative flows. Relation are obtained between intrinsic topological and
geometrical properties of the manifold and that of SDEs. Information on the homotopy and cohomology
of the manifolds are obtained from moment stability of the stochastic flows.

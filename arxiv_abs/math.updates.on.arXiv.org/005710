In this article, we first prove "scale-invariant" $L^p$-estimates for the Schr\"odinger kernel
on compact semisimple groups for major arcs of the time variable, using a barycentric decomposition
of the Weyl alcove and sharp integral estimates of some weight functions associated to the parabolic
subsystems of the root system. Then we give applications to two Fourier restriction problems on
compact groups. The first is to improve the range of exponent for scale-invariant Strichartz estimates
on compact semisimple groups. For such a group $M$ of dimension $d$ and rank $r$, let $s$ be the largest
among the numbers $2d_0/(d_0-r_0)$, where $d_0,r_0$ are respectively the dimension and rank of
a simple factor of $M$. We establish \begin{align*} \|e^{it\Delta}f\|_{L^p(I\times M)}\lesssim
\|f\|_{H^{d/2-(d+2)/p}(M)} \end{align*} for $p>2+8(s-1)/sr$ and $r\geq 2$. The second is to
prove some eigenfunction bounds for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on compact semisimple groups.
For any eigenfunction $f$ of eigenvalue $-\lambda$, we establish \begin{align*} \|f\|_{L^p(M)}\lesssim\lambda^{(d-2)/4-d/2p}\|f\|_{L^2(M)}
\end{align*} for $p>2sr/(sr-4s+4)$ and $r\geq 5$. By a more refined approach, we also establish
the above eigenfunction bound with an extra $\lambda^\varepsilon$ factor for the larger range
$p>2s(r+1)/(sr-3s+4)$ and $r\geq 4$. We then provide evidence for the optimal range for both estimates
by studying class functions, and in the meanwhile put a spotlight on some naturally conjectured
exponential sum estimates. Lastly, as quick by-products of some of our argument, we provide some
sharp $L^p$ bounds for joint eigenfunctions of invariant differential operators on compact simple
groups, without assuming any regularity conditions on the spectral parameter.

The Alexandrov--Fenchel inequality bounds from below the square of the mixed volume $V(K_1,K_2,K_3,\ldots,K_n)$
of convex bodies $K_1,\ldots,K_n$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$ by the product of the mixed volumes $V(K_1,K_1,K_3,\ldots,K_n)$
and $V(K_2,K_2,K_3,\ldots,K_n)$. As a consequence, for integers $\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_m\in\mathbb{N}$
with $\alpha_1+\cdots+\alpha_m=n$ the product $V_n(K_1)^{\frac{\alpha_1}{n}}\cdots V_n(K_m)^{\frac{\alpha_m}{n}}
$ of suitable powers of the volumes $V_n(K_i)$ of the convex bodies $K_i$, $i=1,\ldots,m$, is a lower
bound for the mixed volume $V(K_1[\alpha_1],\ldots,K_m[\alpha_m])$, where $\alpha_i$ is the
multiplicity with which $K_i$ appears in the mixed volume. It has been conjectured by Ulrich Betke
and Wolfgang Weil that there is a reverse inequality, that is, a sharp upper bound for the mixed volume
$V(K_1[\alpha_1],\ldots,K_m[\alpha_m])$ in terms of the product of the intrinsic volumes $V_{\alpha_i}(K_i)$,
for $i=1,\ldots,m$. The case where $m=2$, $\alpha_1=1$, $\alpha_2=n-1$ has recently been settled
by the present authors (2020). The case where $m=3$, $\alpha_1=\alpha_2=1$, $\alpha_3=n-2$ has
been treated by Artstein-Avidan, Florentin, Ostrover (2014) under the assumption that $K_2$ is
a zonoid and $K_3$ is the Euclidean unit ball. The case where $\alpha_2=\cdots=\alpha_m=1$, $K_1$
is the unit ball and $K_2,\ldots,K_m$ are zonoids has been considered by Hug, Schneider (2011).
Here we substantially generalize these previous contributions, in cases where most of the bodies
are zonoids, and thus we provide further evidence supporting the conjectured reverse Alexandrov--Fenchel
inequality. The equality cases in all considered inequalities are characterized. More generally,
stronger stability results are established as well.

Observability is a fundamental structural property of any dynamic system and describes the possibility
of reconstructing the state that characterizes the system from observing its inputs and outputs.
Despite the huge effort made to study this property, there is no general analytical criterion to
automatically check the state observability when the dynamics are also driven by unknown inputs.
Here, we introduce the general analytical solution of this fundamental problem, often called the
unknown input observability problem. We provide the systematic procedure, based on automatic
computation (differentiation and matrix rank determination), that allows us to automatically
check the state observability even in the presence of unknown inputs. The fundamental step to obtain
this solution is the introduction of the group of invariance of observability. We introduce the
group of transformations under which observability is invariant. Based on this group, we introduce
new tensor fields with respect to this group of transformations. The analytical solution of the
unknown input observability problem is expressed in terms of these tensors. This paper provides
this solution together with the main analytical steps for its derivation and a sketch of the proof
of its validity. A complete derivation, together with additional important properties, is available
in [45]. On the other hand, this paper also provides a more general solution than the one presented
in [45] by exhaustively dealing with the systems that do not belong to the category of the systems
that are canonic with respect to their unknown inputs. This solution is also provided in the form
of a new algorithm. We illustrate the implementation of the new algorithm by studying the observability
properties of a nonlinear system in the framework of visual-inertial sensor fusion.

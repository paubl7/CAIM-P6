This work deals with the inference of catalytic recombination parameters from plasma wind tunnel
experiments for reusable thermal protection materials. One of the critical factors affecting
the performance of such materials is the contribution to the heat flux of the exothermic recombination
reactions at the vehicle surface. The main objective of this work is to develop a dedicated Bayesian
framework that allows us to compare uncertain measurements with model predictions which depend
on the catalytic parameter values. Our framework accounts for uncertainties involved in the model
definition and incorporates all measured variables with their respective uncertainties. The
physical model used for the estimation consists of a 1D boundary layer solver along the stagnation
line. The chemical production term included in the surface mass balance depends on the catalytic
recombination efficiency. As not all the different quantities needed to simulate a reacting boundary
layer can be measured or known (such as the flow enthalpy at the inlet boundary), we propose an optimization
procedure built on the construction of the likelihood function to determine their most likely values
based on the available experimental data. This procedure avoids the need to introduce any a priori
estimates on the nuisance quantities, namely, the boundary layer edge enthalpy, wall temperatures,
static and dynamic pressures, which would entail the use of very wide priors. We substitute the optimal
likelihood of the experimental data with a surrogate model to make the inference procedure both
faster and more robust. We show that the resulting Bayesian formulation yields meaningful and accurate
posterior distributions of the catalytic parameters with a reduction of more than 20% of the standard
deviation with respect to previous works. We also study the implications of an extension of the experimental
procedure.

We establish the existence of a broad class of asymptotically Euclidean solutions to Einstein's
constraint equations whose asymptotic behavior at infinity is prescribed. The seed-to-solution
method proposed in this paper encompasses vacuum spaces as well as spaces with (possibly slowly
decaying) matter, by relying on iterations based on the linearized Einstein operator and its dual.
It generates a Riemannian manifold from any seed data set consisting of (1): a Riemannian metric
and a symmetric two-tensor prescribed on a manifold with finitely many asymptotically Euclidean
ends, and (2): a (density) field and a (momentum) vector field representing the prescribed matter
content. We distinguish between several classes of seed data referred to as tame or strongly tame,
depending whether the data provides a rough or an accurate asymptotic Ansatz at infinity. We encompass
classes of metrics with the weakest possible decay at infinity (with infinite ADM mass), as well
as with the strongest possible decay (with Schwarzschild behavior). Our analysis is motivated
by Carlotto and Schoen's pioneering work on the localization problem for Einstein's vacuum equations.
We study critical terms arising in the Einstein equations and, in this way, we uncover the novel notion
of mass-momentum correctors. We estimate the difference between the seed data and the actual Einstein
solution, a result that should be of interest for numerical computations. We also introduce and
study here the asymptotic localization problem (as we call it) in which the Carlotto-Schoen's localization
requirement is imposed in an asymptotic sense, only. By applying the seed-to-solution method with
a suitably chosen, parametrized family of seed data, we solve this problem at the critical decay
level.

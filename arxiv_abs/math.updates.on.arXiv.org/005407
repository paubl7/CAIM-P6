Fisher [Fis75] and Baur [Bau75] showed independently in the seventies that if $T$ is a complete first-order
theory extending the theory of modules, then the class of models of $T$ with pure embeddings is stable.
In [Maz4, 2.12], it is asked if the same is true for any abstract elementary class $(K, \leq_p)$ such
that $K$ is a class of modules and $\leq_p$ is the pure submodule relation. In this paper we give some
instances where this is true: $\textbf{Theorem.}$ Assume $R$ is an associative ring with unity.
Let $(K, \leq_p)$ be an AEC such that $K \subseteq R\text{-Mod}$ and $K$ is closed under finite direct
sums, then: - If $K$ is closed under direct summands and pure-injective envelopes, then $(K, \leq_p)$
is $\lambda$-stable for every $\lambda \geq LS(K)$ such that $\lambda^{|R| + \aleph_0}= \lambda$.
- If $K$ is closed under pure submodules and pure epimorphic images, then $(K, \leq_p)$ is $\lambda$-stable
for every $\lambda$ such that $\lambda^{|R| + \aleph_0}= \lambda$. - Assume $R$ is Von Neumann regular.
If $K$ is closed under submodules and has arbitrarily large models, then $(K, \leq_p)$ is $\lambda$-stable
for every $\lambda$ such that $\lambda^{|R| + \aleph_0}= \lambda$. As an application of these results
we give new characterizations of noetherian rings, pure-semisimple rings, dedekind domains and
fields via superstability. Moreover, we show how these results can be used to show a link between
being good in the stability hierarchy and being good in the axiomatizability hierarchy. Another
application is the existence of universal models with respect to pure embeddings in several classes
of modules. Among them, the class of flat modules and the class of injective torsion modules.

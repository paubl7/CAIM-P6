Adapting the blow-up arguments in \cite{simon1993cylindrical} and \cite{wickramasekera2014general},
we prove a $C^{1,\alpha}$ regularity theorem for stable codimension one integral $n$-varifolds
which are sufficiently close to a \lq\lq classical cone'' of density $\frac{5}{2}$, i.e., a stationary
integral cone supported on at most 5 half-hyperplanes meeting along a common $(n-1)$-dimensional
axis with density $\frac{5}{2}$ at the origin. Our result is the first of its kind for non-flat cones
with multiplicity $>1$ when branch points are present in the nearby varifold. The only additional
hypothesis necessary for our result is geometric: ruling out singularities comprised of three
$C^{1,\alpha}$ hypersurfaces-with-boundary meeting (only) along their common boundary; the
corresponding results when the density of the classical cone is $\frac{3}{2}$ or $2$ -- in which
case the cone has multiplicity one almost everywhere -- have been previously established in \cite{simon1993cylindrical}
and \cite{wick2021} respectively. For such varifolds the present work completes the analysis
of the singular set in the region where the density is $<3$, up to a set which is countably $(n-2)$-rectifiable.
A key new ingredient in our work is establishing a $C^{1,\alpha}$ boundary regularity theory for
two-valued $C^{1,\alpha}$ harmonic functions which arise as blow-ups of sequences of such varifolds;
this is discussed more generally in the accompanying work \cite{minter2021}. Subject to appropriate
conditions on lower density classical singularities and (expected) regularity theorems concerning
lower density branch point singularities, our arguments have the potential to be iterated inductively
to establish regularity results for stable codimension one integral varifolds near classical
cones of density $q+\frac{1}{2}$ at the origin.

The MaxCut problem asks for the size ${\rm mc}(G)$ of a largest cut in a graph $G$. It is well known that
${\rm mc}(G)\ge m/2$ for any $m$-edge graph $G$, and the difference ${\rm mc}(G)-m/2$ is called
the surplus of $G$. The study of the surplus of $H$-free graphs was initiated by Erd\H{o}s and Lov\'asz
in the 70s, who in particular asked what happens for triangle-free graphs. This was famously resolved
by Alon, who showed that in the triangle-free case the surplus is $\Omega(m^{4/5})$, and found constructions
matching this bound. We prove several new results in this area. Firstly, we show that for every fixed
odd $r\ge 3$, any $C_r$-free graph with $m$ edges has surplus $\Omega_r\big(m^{\frac{r+1}{r+2}}\big)$.
This is tight, as is shown by a construction of pseudorandom $C_r$-free graphs due to Alon and Kahale.
It improves previous results of several researchers, and complements a result of Alon, Krivelevich
and Sudakov which is the same bound when $r$ is even. Secondly, generalizing the result of Alon, we
allow the graph to have triangles, and show that if the number of triangles is a bit less than in a random
graph with the same density, then the graph has large surplus. For regular graphs our bounds on the
surplus are sharp. Thirdly, we prove that an $n$-vertex graph with few copies of $K_r$ and average
degree $d$ has surplus $\Omega_r(d^{r-1}/n^{r-3})$, which is tight when $d$ is close to $n$ provided
that a conjectured dense pseudorandom $K_r$-free graph exists. This result is used to improve the
best known lower bound (as a function of $m$) on the surplus of $K_r$-free graphs. Our proofs combine
techniques from semidefinite programming, probabilistic reasoning, as well as combinatorial
and spectral arguments.

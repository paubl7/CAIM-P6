In this work we extend the theory of global pseudo-differential operators on compact Lie groups
to a subelliptic context. More precisely,given a compact Lie group $G$, and the sub-Laplacian $\mathcal{L}$
associated to a system of vector fields satisfying the H\"ormander condition, we introduce a (subelliptic)
pseudo-differential calculus associated to $\mathcal{L},$ based on the matrix-valued quantisation
process developed in [111]. This theory will be developed as follows. First, we will investigate
the singular kernels of this calculus, estimates of Lp-Lp, H1-L1, $L^\infty$-BMO type and also
the weak (1,1) boundedness of these subelliptic H\"ormander classes. Between the obtained estimates
we prove subelliptic versions of the celebrated sharp Fefferman Lp-theorem and the Calder\'on-Vaillancourt
theorem. The obtained estimates will be used to establish the boundedness of subelliptic operators
on subelliptic Sobolev and Besov spaces. We will investigate the ellipticity, the construction
of parametrices, the heat traces and the regularisation of traces for the developed subelliptic
calculus. A subelliptic global functional calculus will be established as well as a subelliptic
version of Hulanicki theorem. This subelliptic functional calculus will be used to prove a subelliptic
version of the G\r{a}rding inequality, which we also use to study the global solvability for a class
of subelliptic pseudo-differential problems. Finally, by using both, the matrix-valued symbols
and also the notion of matrix-valued phases we study the $L^2$-boundedness of global Fourier integral
operators. The approach established in characterising our subelliptic H\"ormander classes (by
proving that the definition of these classes is independent of certain parameters) will be also
applied in order to characterise the global H\"ormander classes on arbitrary graded Lie groups
developed in [66].

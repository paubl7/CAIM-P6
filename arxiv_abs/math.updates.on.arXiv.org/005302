We develop the representation theory of shifted quantum affine algebras $\mathcal{U}_q^\mu(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$
and of their truncations which appeared in the study of quantized K-theoretic Coulomb branches
of 3d $N = 4$ SUSY quiver gauge theories. Our direct approach is based on relations that we establish
with the category $\mathcal{O}$ of representations of the quantum affine Borel algebra $\mathcal{U}_q(\hat{\mathfrak{b}})$
and on associated quantum integrable models we have previously studied. We introduce the category
$\mathcal{O}^\mu$ of representations of $\mathcal{U}_q^\mu(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$ and we classify
its simple objects. For $\mathfrak{g} = sl_2$ we prove the existence of evaluation morphisms to
$q$-oscillator algebras. We establish the existence of a fusion product and we get a ring structure
on the sum of the Grothendieck groups $K_0(\mathcal{O}^\mu)$. We introduce induction and restriction
functors to the category $\mathcal{O}$ of $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{b})$. As a by product we classify
simple finite-dimensional representations of $\mathcal{U}_q^\mu(\hat{\mathfrak{g}})$ and
we obtain a cluster algebra structure on the Grothendieck ring of finite-dimensional representations.
We establish a necessary condition for a simple representation to descend to a truncation, which
is also sufficient for $\mathfrak{g} = sl_2$. We introduce a related partial ordering on simple
modules and we prove a truncation has only a finite number of simple representations. We state a conjecture
on the parametrization of simple modules of a non simply-laced truncation in terms of the Langlands
dual Lie algebra. We have several evidences, including a general result for simple finite-dimensional
representations proved by using the Baxter polynomiality of quantum integrable models.

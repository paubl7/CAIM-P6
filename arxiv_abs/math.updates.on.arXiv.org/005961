Kinetic theory describes a dilute monatomic gas using a distribution function $f(q,p,t)$, the
expected phase-space density of particles. The distribution function evolves according to the
collisionless Boltzmann equation in the high Knudsen number limit. Fluid dynamics is an alternative
description of the gas using hydrodynamic variables that are functions of position and time only.
These hydrodynamic variables evolve according to the compressible Euler equations in the inviscid
limit. Both systems are noncanonical Hamiltonian systems. Each configuration space is an infinite-dimensional
Poisson manifold, and the dynamics is the flow generated by a Hamiltonian functional via a Poisson
bracket. We construct a map $\mathcal{J}_1$ from the space of distribution functions to the space
of hydrodynamic variables that respects the Poisson brackets on the two spaces i.e. a Poisson map.
It maps the $p$-integral of the Boltzmann entropy $f\log f$ to the hydrodynamic entropy density.
This map belongs to a family of Poisson maps to spaces that include generalised entropy densities
as additional hydrodynamic variables. The whole family can be generated from the Taylor expansion
of a further Poisson map that depends on a formal parameter. If the kinetic-theory Hamiltonian factors
through the Poisson map $\mathcal{J}_1$, an exact reduction of kinetic theory to fluid dynamics
is possible. This is not the case, but by ignoring the relative entropy of $f$ to its local Maxwellian,
we can construct an approximate Hamiltonian that factors through the map. The resulting reduced
Hamiltonian generates the compressible Euler equations. We can thus derive the compressible Euler
equations as a Hamiltonian approximation to kinetic theory. We also give an analogous Hamiltonian
derivation of the compressible Euler--Poisson equations with non-constant entropy, starting
from the Vlasov--Poisson equation.

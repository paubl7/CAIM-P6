The resolution of $4$-dimensional massless field operators of higher spins was constructed by
Eastwood-Penrose-Wells by using the twistor method. Recently physicists are interested in $6$-dimensional
physics including the massless field operators of higher spins on Lorentzian space $\Bbb R^{5,1}$.
Its Euclidean version $\mathscr{D}_0$ and their function theory are discussed in \cite{wangkang3}.
In this paper, we construct an exact sequence of Hilbert spaces as weighted $L^2$ spaces resolving
$\mathscr{D}_0$: $$L^2_\varphi(\Bbb R^6, \mathscr{V}_0)\overset{\mathscr{D}_0}\longrightarrow
L^2_\varphi(\Bbb R^6,\mathscr{V}_1)\overset{\mathscr{D}_1}\longrightarrow L^2_\varphi(\Bbb
R^6, \mathscr{V}_2)\overset{\mathscr{D}_2}\longrightarrow L^2_\varphi(\Bbb R^6, \mathscr{V}_3)\longrightarrow
0,$$ with suitable operators $\mathscr{D}_l$ and vector spaces $\mathscr{V}_l$. Namely, we can
solve $\mathscr{D}_{l}u=f$ in $L^2_\varphi(\Bbb R^6, \mathscr{V}_{l})$ when $\mathscr{D}_{l+1}
f=0$ for $f\in L^2_{\varphi}(\Bbb R^6, \mathscr{V}_{l+1})$. This is proved by using the $L^2$
method in the theory of several complex variables, which is a general framework to solve overdetermined
PDEs under the compatibility condition. To apply this method here, it is necessary to consider weighted
$L^2$ spaces, an advantage of which is that any polynomial is $L^2_{\varphi}$ integrable. As a corollary,
we prove that $$ P(\Bbb R^6, \mathscr{V}_0)\overset{\mathscr{D}_0}\longrightarrow P(\Bbb
R^6,\mathscr{V}_1)\overset{\mathscr{D}_1}\longrightarrow P(\Bbb R^6, \mathscr{V}_2)\overset{\mathscr{D}_2}\longrightarrow
P(\Bbb R^6, \mathscr{V}_3)\longrightarrow 0$$ is a resolution, where $P(\Bbb R^6, \mathscr{V}_l)$
is the space of all $\mathscr{V}_l$-valued polynomials. This provides an analytic way to construct
a resolution of a differential operator acting on vector valued polynomials.

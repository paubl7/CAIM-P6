We consider the problem of constructing pointwise confidence intervals in the multiple isotonic
regression model. Recently, [HZ19] obtained a pointwise limit distribution theory for the so-called
block max-min and min-max estimators [FLN17] in this model, but inference remains a difficult problem
due to the nuisance parameter in the limit distribution that involves multiple unknown partial
derivatives of the true regression function. In this paper, we show that this difficult nuisance
parameter can be effectively eliminated by taking advantage of information beyond point estimates
in the block max-min and min-max estimators. Formally, let $\hat{u}(x_0)$ (resp. $\hat{v}(x_0)$)
be the maximizing lower-left (resp. minimizing upper-right) vertex in the block max-min (resp.
min-max) estimator, and $\hat{f}_n$ be the average of the block max-min and min-max estimators.
If all (first-order) partial derivatives of $f_0$ are non-vanishing at $x_0$, then the following
pivotal limit distribution theory holds: $$ \sqrt{n_{\hat{u},\hat{v}}(x_0)}\big(\hat{f}_n(x_0)-f_0(x_0)\big)\rightsquigarrow
\sigma\cdot \mathbb{L}_{1_d}. $$ Here $n_{\hat{u},\hat{v}}(x_0)$ is the number of design points
in the block $[\hat{u}(x_0),\hat{v}(x_0)]$, $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the errors,
and $\mathbb{L}_{1_d}$ is a universal limit distribution free of nuisance parameters. This immediately
yields confidence intervals for $f_0(x_0)$ with asymptotically exact confidence level and oracle
length. Notably, the construction of the confidence intervals, even new in the univariate setting,
requires no more efforts than performing an isotonic regression for once using the block max-min
and min-max estimators, and can be easily adapted to other common monotone models. Extensive simulations
are carried out to support our theory.

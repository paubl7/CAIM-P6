By juxtaposing ideas from fractal geometry and dynamical systems, Furstenberg proposed a series
of conjectures in the late 1960's that explore the relationship between digit expansions with respect
to multiplicatively independent bases. In this work, we introduce and study - in the discrete context
of the integers - analogues of some of the notions and results surrounding Furstenberg's work. In
particular, we define a new class of fractal sets of integers that parallels the notion of $\times
r$-invariant sets on the 1-torus and investigate the additive and geometric independence between
two such fractal sets when they are structured with respect to multiplicatively independent bases.
Our main results in this direction parallel the works of Furstenberg, Hochman-Shmerkin, Shmerkin,
Wu, and Lindenstrauss-Meiri-Peres and include: -a classification of all subsets of the positive
integers that are simultaneously $\times r$- and $\times s$-invariant; -integer analogues of
two of Furstenberg's transversality conjectures pertaining to the dimensions of the intersection
$A\cap B$ and the sumset $A+B$ of $\times r$- and $\times s$-invariant sets $A$ and $B$ when $r$ and
$s$ are multiplicatively independent; and -a description of the dimension of iterated sumsets
$A+A+\cdots+A$ for any $\times r$-invariant set $A$. We achieve these results by combining ideas
from fractal geometry and ergodic theory to build a bridge between the continuous and discrete regimes.
For the transversality results, we rely heavily on quantitative bounds on the $L^q$-dimensions
of projections of restricted digit Cantor measures obtained recently by Shmerkin. We end by outlining
a number of open questions and directions regarding fractal subsets of the integers.

A transshipment problem (G, d, \lambda) is modeled by a directed graph G = (V, E) with weighted vertices
d = (d_v | v \in V) and directed edges \lambda = (\lambda_e | e \in E) interpreted as follows: G is a communication
or transportation network, e.g., a pipeline; each edge e \in E is a one-way communication line, road
or pipe of capacity \lambda_e, while every vertex v \in V is a node of production d_v > 0, consumption
d_v < 0, or transition d_v = 0. A non-negative flow x = (x_e \mid e \in E) is called weakly feasible if
for each v \in V the algebraic sum of flows, over all directed edges incident to v, equals d_v; or shorter,
if A_G x = d, where A_G is the vertex-edge incidence matrix of G. A weakly feasible flow x is called feasible
if x_e \leq \lambda_e for all e \in E. We consider weakly feasible but not necessarily feasible flows,
that is, inequalities x_e > \lambda_e are allowed. However, such an excess is viewed as unwanted
(dangerous) and so we minimize the excess ratio vector r = (r_e = x_e / \lambda_e | e \in E) lexicographically.
More precisely, first, we look for the weakly feasible flows minimizing the maximum of re over all
e in E; among all such flows we look for those that minimize the second largest coordinate of r, etc.
Clearly, |E| such steps define a unique balanced flow, which provides the lexmin solution for problem
(G, d, \lambda). We construct it in polynomial time, provided vectors d and \lambda are integer.
For symmetric digraphs the problem was solved by Gurvich and Gvishiani in 1984. Here we extend this
result to directed graphs. Furthermore, we simplify the algorithm and proofs applying the classic
criterion of existence of a feasible flow for (G, d, \lambda) obtained by Gale and Hoffman in late
1950-s.

In this paper, we define a notion of containment and avoidance for subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$. Then
we introduce a new, continuous and super-additive extremal function for subsets $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$
called $px(n, P)$, which is the supremum of $\mu_2(S)$ over all open $P$-free subsets $S \subseteq
[0, n]^2$, where $\mu_2(S)$ denotes the Lebesgue measure of $S$ in $\mathbb{R}^2$. We show that
$px(n, P)$ fully encompasses the Zarankiewicz problem and more generally the 0-1 matrix extremal
function $ex(n, M)$ up to a constant factor. More specifically, we define a natural correspondence
between finite subsets $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ and 0-1 matrices $M_P$, and we prove that $px(n,
P) = \Theta(ex(n, M_P))$ for all finite subsets $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, where the constants
in the bounds depend only on the distances between the points in $P$. We also discuss bounded infinite
subsets $P$ for which $px(n, P)$ grows faster than $ex(n, M)$ for all fixed 0-1 matrices $M$. In particular,
we show that $px(n, P) = \Theta(n^{2})$ for any open subset $P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$. We prove
an even stronger result, that if $Q_P$ is the set of points with rational coordinates in any open subset
$P \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, then $px(n, Q_P) = \Theta(n^2)$. Finally, we obtain a strengthening
of the K\H{o}vari-S\'{o}s-Tur\'{a}n theorem that applies to infinite subsets of $\mathbb{R}^2$.
Specifically, for subsets $P_{s, t, c} \subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$ consisting of $t$ horizontal line
segments of length $s$ with left endpoints on the same vertical line with consecutive segments a
distance of $c$ apart, we prove that $px(n, P_{s, t,c}) = O(s^{\frac{1}{t}}n^{2-\frac{1}{t}})$,
where the constant in the bound depends on $t$ and $c$. When $t = 2$, we show that this bound is sharp
up to a constant factor that depends on $c$.

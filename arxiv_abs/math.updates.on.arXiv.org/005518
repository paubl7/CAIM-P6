This paper provides an extended case study of the cutoff phenomenon for a prototypical class of nonlinear
Langevin systems with a single stable state perturbed by an additive pure jump L\'evy noise of small
amplitude $\varepsilon>0$, where the driving noise process is of layered stable type. Under a drift
coercivity condition the associated family of processes $X^\varepsilon$ turns out to be exponentially
ergodic with equilibrium distribution $\mu^{\varepsilon}$ in total variation distance which
extends a result from Peng and Zhang (2018) to arbitrary moments. The main results establish the
cutoff phenomenon with respect to the total variation, under a sufficient smoothing condition
of Blumenthal-Getoor index $\alpha>\frac{3}{2}$. That is to say, in this setting we identify a
deterministic time scale $\mathfrak{t}_{\varepsilon}^{\mathrm{cut}}$ satisfying $\mathfrak{t}_
\varepsilon^{\mathrm{cut}} \rightarrow \infty$, as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$, and a respective
time window, $\mathfrak{t}_\varepsilon^{\mathrm{cut}} \pm o(\mathfrak{t}_\varepsilon^{\mathrm{cut}})$,
during which the total variation distance between the current state and its equilibrium $\mu^{\varepsilon}$
essentially collapses as $\varepsilon$ tends to zero. In addition, we extend the dynamical characterization
under which the latter phenomenon can be described by the convergence of such distance to a unique
profile function first established in Barrera and Jara (2020) to the L\'evy case for nonlinear drift.
This leads to sufficient conditions, which can be verified in examples, such as gradient systems
subject to small symmetric $\alpha$-stable noise for $\alpha>\frac{3}{2}$. The proof techniques
differ completely from the Gaussian case due to the absence of respective Girsanov transforms which
couple the nonlinear equation and the linear approximation asymptotically even for short times.

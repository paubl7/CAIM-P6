Consider the Ising model on a centered box of side length $n$ in $\mathbb Z^d$ with $\mp$-boundary
conditions that are minus in the upper half-space and plus in the lower half-space. Dobrushin famously
showed that in dimensions $d\ge 3$, at low-temperatures the Ising interface (dual-surface separating
the plus/minus phases) is rigid, i.e., it has $O(1)$ height fluctuations. Recently, the authors
decomposed these oscillations into pillars and identified their typical shape, leading to a law
of large numbers and tightness of their maximum. Suppose we condition on a height-$h$ level curve
of the interface, bounding a set $S \subset \mathbb Z^{d-1}$, along with the entire interface outside
the cylinder $S\times \mathbb Z$: what does the interface in $S\times \mathbb Z$ look like? Many
models of random surfaces (e.g., SOS and DGFF) fundamentally satisfy the domain Markov property,
whereby their heights on $S$ only depend on the heights on $S^c$ through the heights on $\partial
S$. The Ising interface importantly does not satisfy this property; the law of the interface depends
on the full spin configuration outside $S\times \mathbb Z$. Here we establish an approximate domain
Markov property inside the level curves of the Ising interface. We first extend Dobrushin's result
to this setting, showing the interface in $S\times \mathbb Z$ is rigid about height $h$, with exponential
tails on its height oscillations. Then we show that the typical tall pillars in $S\times \mathbb
Z$ are uniformly absolutely continuous with respect to tall pillars of the unconditional Ising
interface. Using this we identify the law of large numbers, tightness, and Gumbel tail bounds on
the maximum oscillations in $S\times \mathbb Z$ about height $h$, showing that these only depend
on the conditioning through the cardinality of $S$.

The manuscript is concerned with a continuous adjoint complement to two-dimensional, incompressible,
first-order boundary-layer equations for a flat plate boundary-layer. The text is structured
into three parts. The first part demonstrates, that the adjoint complement can be derived in two
ways, either following a first simplify then derive or a first derive and then simplify strategy.
The simplification step comprises the classical boundary-layer (b.-l.) approximation and the
derivation step transfers the primal flow equation into a companion adjoint equation. The second
part of the paper comprises the analyses of the coupled primal/adjoint b.-l. framework. This leads
to similarity parameters, which turn the Partial-Differential-Equation (PDE) problem into a
boundary value problem described by a set of Ordinary-Differential-Equations (ODE) and support
the formulation of an adjoint complement to the classical Blasius equation. Opposite to the primal
Blasius equation, its adjoint complement consists of two ODEs which can be simplified depending
on the treatment of advection. It is shown, that the advective fluxes, which are frequently debated
in the literature, vanish for the investigated self-similar b.l. flows. Differences between the
primal and the adjoint Blasius framework are discussed against numerical solutions, and analytical
expressions are derived for the adjoint b.-l. thickness, wall shear stress and subordinated skin
friction and drag coefficients. The analysis also provides an analytical expression for the shape
sensitivity to shear driven drag objectives. The third part assesses the predictive agreement
between the different Blasius solutions and numerical results for Navier-Stokes simulations
of a flat plate b.-l. at Reynolds numbers between 1E+03 <= ReL <= 1E+05 .

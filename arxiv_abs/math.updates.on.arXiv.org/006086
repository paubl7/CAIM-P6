Hamkins and Kikuchi (2016 and 2017) show that in both set theory and class theory the definable subset
ordering of the universe interprets a complete and decidable theory. If $\mathcal{M}$ is a model
of set theory, then $\langle M, \subseteq^\mathcal{M} \rangle$ is an atomic unbounded relatively
complemented distributive lattice. If $\mathcal{M}$ is model of class theory, then $\langle M,
\subseteq^\mathcal{M} \rangle$ is an infinite atomic boolean algebra. We identify the minimal
subsystem of $\mathrm{ZF}$, $\mathrm{BAS}$, that ensures that the definable subset relation
is an atomic unbounded relatively complemented distributive lattice and classify the atomic unbounded
relatively complemented distributive lattices that can be realised as a subset relations of this
theory. The fact that the theory of atomic unbounded relatively complemented distributive lattices
is complete is used to show that $\mathrm{BAS}$ decides every $2$-stratified sentence of set theory.
We also identify the minimal subsystem of $\mathrm{NBG}$, $\mathrm{BAC}$, that ensures that the
definable subset relation is an infinite atomic Boolean algebra. We show that there is a complete
extension, $\mathrm{IABA}_\mathrm{Ideal}$, of the theory of infinite atomic boolean algebras
and an extension $\mathrm{BAC}^+$ of $\mathrm{BAC}$ corresponding to the minimal theory such
that if $\mathcal{M}$ is a model of $\mathrm{BAC}^+$, then $\langle M, \mathcal{S}^\mathcal{M},
\subseteq^\mathcal{M} \rangle$ is a model of $\mathrm{IABA}_{\mathrm{Ideal}}$, where $\mathcal{S}^\mathcal{M}$
is a unary predicate that distinguishes sets from classes. This is used to show that $\mathrm{BAC}^+$,
a subsystem of $\mathrm{NBG}$, decides every $2$-sentence in the language of class theory that
includes a unary predicate distinguishing sets from classes.

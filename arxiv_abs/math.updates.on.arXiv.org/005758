Recently the synchrosqueezed transform (SST) was developed as an empirical mode decomposition
(EMD)-like tool to enhance the time-frequency resolution and energy concentration of a multi-component
non-stationary signal and provides more accurate component recovery. To recover individual components,
the SST method consists of two steps. First the instantaneous frequency (IF) of a component is estimated
from the SST plane. Secondly, after IF is recovered, the associated component is computed by a definite
integral along the estimated IF curve on the SST plane. The reconstruction accuracy for a component
depends heavily on the accuracy of the IFs estimation carried out in the first step. More recently,
a direct method of the time-frequency approach, called signal separation operation (SSO), was
introduced for multi-component signal separation. While both SST and SSO are mathematically rigorous
on IF estimation, SSO avoids the second step of the two-step SST method in component recovery (mode
retrieval). The SSO method is based on some variant of the short-time Fourier transform. In the present
paper, we propose a direct method of signal separation based on the adaptive continuous wavelet-like
transform (CWLT) by introducing two models of the adaptive CWLT-based approach for signal separation:
the sinusoidal signal-based model and the linear chirp-based model, which are derived respectively
from sinusoidal signal approximation and the linear chirp approximation at any time instant. A
more accurate component recovery formula is derived from linear chirp local approximation. We
present the theoretical analysis of our approach. For each model, we establish the error bounds
for IF estimation and component recovery.

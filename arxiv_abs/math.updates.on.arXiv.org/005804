We studied Ramanujan series $\sum_{q=1}^{\infty}G(q)c_q(a)$, where $c_q(a)$ is the well-known
Ramanujan sum and the complex numbers $G(q)$, as $q\in$N, are the Ramanujan coefficients; of course,
we mean, implicitly, that the series converges pointwise, in all natural $a$, as its partial sums
$\sum_{q\le Q}G(q)c_q(a)$ converge in C, when $Q\to \infty$. Motivated by our recent study of infinite
and finite Euler products for the Ramanujan series, in which we assumed $G$ multiplicative, we look
at a kind of (partial) smooth summations. These are $\sum_{q\in (P)}G(q)c_q(a)$, where the indices
$q$ in $(P)$ means that all prime factors $p$ of $q$ are up to $P$ (fixed); then, we pass to the limit
over $P\to \infty$. Notice that this kind of partial sums over $P-$smooth numbers (i.e., in $(P)$,
see the above) make up an infinite sum, themselves, $\forall P\in$P fixed, in general; however,
our summands contain $c_q(a)$, that has a vertical limit, i.e. it's supported over indices $q\in$N
for which the $p-$adic valuations of, resp., $q$ and $a$, namely $v_p(q)$, resp., $v_p(a)$ satisfy
$v_p(q)\le v_p(a)+1$ and this is true $\forall p\le P$ ($P$'s fixed). In other words, the series
$\sum_{q\in (P)}G(q)c_q(a)$ is a finite sum, $\forall a\in $N, $\forall P\in $P fixed: we will call
$\sum_{q=1}^{\infty}G(q)c_q(a)$ a 'smooth Ramanujan series' if and only if $\exists \lim_P \sum_{q\in
(P)}G(q)c_q(a)\in $C, $\forall a\in $N. Notice a very important property : smooth Ramanujan series
and Ramanujan series need not to be the same. We prove : smooth Ramanujan series converge under Wintner
Assumption. (This is not necessarily true for Ramanujan series.) We apply this to correlations
and to the Hardy--Littlewood "$2k-$Twin Primes" Conjecture.

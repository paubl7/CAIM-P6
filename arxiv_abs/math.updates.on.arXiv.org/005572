We present a simple model of alignment of a large number of rigid bodies (modeled by rotation matrices)
subject to internal rotational noise. The numerical simulations exhibit a phenomenon of first
order phase transition with respect the alignment intensity, with abrupt transition at two thresholds.
Below the first threshold, the system is disordered in large time: the rotation matrices are uniformly
distributed. Above the second threshold, the long time behaviour of the system is to concentrate
around a given rotation matrix. When the intensity is between the two thresholds, both situations
may occur. We then study the mean-field limit of this model, as the number of particles tends to infinity,
which takes the form of a nonlinear Fokker--Planck equation. We describe the complete classification
of the steady states of this equation, which fits with numerical experiments. This classification
was obtained in a previous work by Degond, Diez, Merino-Aceituno and the author, thanks to the link
between this model and a four-dimensional generalization of the Doi--Onsager equation for suspensions
of rodlike polymers interacting through Maier--Saupe potential. This previous study concerned
a similar equation of BGK type for which the steady-states were the same. We take advantage of the
stability results obtained in this framework, and are able to prove the exponential stability of
two families of steady-states: the disordered uniform distribution when the intensity of alignment
is less than the second threshold, and a family of non-isotropic steady states (one for each possible
rotation matrix, concentrated around it), when the intensity is greater than the first threshold.
We also show that the other families of steady-states are unstable, in agreement with the numerical
observations.

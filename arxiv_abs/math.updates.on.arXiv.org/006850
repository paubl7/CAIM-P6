Two ensembles are often used to model random graphs subject to constraints: the microcanonical
ensemble (= hard constraint) and the canonical ensemble (= soft constraint). It is said that breaking
of ensemble equivalence (BEE) occurs when the specific relative entropy of the two ensembles does
not vanish as the size of the graph tends to infinity. The latter means that it matters for the scaling
properties of the graph whether the constraint is met for every single realisation of the graph or
only holds as an ensemble average. In the literature, it was found that BEE is the rule rather than
the exception for two classes: sparse random graphs when the number of constraints is of the order
of the number of vertices and dense random graphs when there are two or more constraints that are frustrated.
In the present paper we establish BEE for a third class: dense random graphs with a single constraint,
namely, on the density of a given finite simple graph. We show that BEE occurs only in a certain range
of choices for the density and the number of edges of the simple graph, which we refer to as the BEE-phase.
We show that, in part of the BEE-phase, there is a gap between the scaling limits of the averages of
the maximal eigenvalue of the adjacency matrix of the random graph under the two ensembles, a property
that is referred to as spectral signature of BEE. Proofs are based on an analysis of the variational
formula on the space of graphons for the limiting specific relative entropy derived by Den Hollander
et al. (2018), in combination with an identification of the minimising graphons and replica symmetry
arguments. We show that in the replica symmetric region of the BEE-phase, as the size of the graph
tends to infinity, the microcanonical ensemble behaves like an Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graph,
while the canonical ensemble behaves like a mixture of two Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi random graphs.

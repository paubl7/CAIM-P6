This paper presents a one-sided immersed boundary (IB) method using kernel functions constructed
via a moving least squares (MLS) method. The resulting kernels effectively couple structural degrees
of freedom to fluid variables on only one side of the fluid-structure interface. This reduces spurious
feedback forcing and internal flows that are typically observed in IB models that use isotropic
kernel functions to couple the structure to fluid degrees of freedom on both sides of the interface.
The method developed here extends the original MLS methodology introduced by Vanella and Balaras
(J Comput Phys, 2009). Prior IB/MLS methods have used isotropic kernel functions that coupled fluid
variables on both sides of the boundary to the interfacial degrees of freedom. The original IB/MLS
approach converts the cubic spline weights typically employed in MLS reconstruction into an IB
kernel function that satisfies particular discrete moment conditions. This paper shows that the
same approach can be used to construct one-sided kernel functions (kernel functions are referred
to as generating functions in the MLS literature). We also examine the performance of the new approach
for a family of kernel functions introduced by Peskin. It is demonstrated that the one-sided MLS
construction tends to generate non-monotone interpolation kernels with large over- and undershoots.
We present two simple weight shifting strategies to construct generating functions that are positive
and monotone, which enhances the stability of the resulting IB methodology. Benchmark cases are
used to test the order of accuracy and verify the one-sided IB/MLS simulations in both two and three
spatial dimensions. This new IB/MLS method is also used to simulate flow over the Ahmed car model,
which highlights the applicability of this methodology for modeling complex engineering flows.

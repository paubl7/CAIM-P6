We improve the lower bound on the $d$-dimensional rectilinear crossing number of the complete $d$-uniform
hypergraph having $2d$ vertices to $\Omega(2^d d)$ from $\Omega(2^d \sqrt{d})$. We also establish
that $3$-dimensional rectilinear crossing number of a complete $3$-uniform hypergraph having
$n \geq 9$ vertices is at least $\dfrac{43}{42}\dbinom{n}{6}$. Anshu et al. conjectured that among
all $d$-dimensional convex drawings of a complete $d$-uniform hypergraph having $n$ vertices,
the number of crossing pairs of hyperedges is maximized if all its vertices are placed on the $d$-dimensional
moment curve and proved this conjecture for $d=3$. It is trivially true for $d = 2$, since any convex
drawing of the complete graph $K_n$ produces $n \choose 4$ pairs of crossing edges. We prove that
their conjecture is true for $d=4$ by using Gale transform. In fact, we prove a stronger statement.
We prove that among all $4$-dimensional rectilinear drawings of a complete $4$-uniform hypergraph
having $n$ vertices, the number of crossing pairs of hyperedges is maximized if all its vertices
are placed on the $4$-dimensional moment curve. We also prove that the maximum $d$-dimensional
rectilinear crossing number of a complete $d$-partite $d$-uniform balanced hypergraph is $(2^{d-1}-1){n
\choose 2}^d$, where $n$ denotes the number of vertices in each part. We then prove that finding the
maximum $d$-dimensional rectilinear crossing number of an arbitrary $d$-uniform hypergraph
is NP-hard and give a randomized scheme to create a $d$-dimensional rectilinear drawing of a $d$-uniform
hypergraph $H$ producing the number of crossing pairs of hyperedges up to a constant factor of the
maximum $d$-dimensional rectilinear crossing number of $H$.

In a recent paper we studied an equation (called the "simple equation") introduced by one of us in
1963 for an approximate correlation function associated to the ground state of an interacting Bose
gas. Solving the equation yields a relation between the density $\rho$ of the gas and the energy per
particle. Our construction of solutions gave a well-defined function $\rho(e)$ for the density
as a function of the energy $e$. We had conjectured that $\rho(e)$ is a strictly monotone increasing
function, so that it can be inverted to yield the strictly monotone increasing function $e(\rho)$.
We had also conjectured that $\rho e(\rho)$ is convex as a function of $\rho$. We prove both conjectures
here for small densities, the context in which they have the most physical relevance, and the monotonicity
also for large densities. Both conjectures are grounded in the underlying physics, and their proof
provides further mathematical evidence for the validity of the assumptions underlying the derivation
of the simple equation, at least for low or high densities, if not intermediate densities, although
the equation gives surprisingly good predictions for all densities $\rho$. Another problem left
open in our previous paper was whether the simple equation could be used to compute accurate predictions
of observables other than the energy. Here, we provide a recipe for computing predictions for any
one- or two-particle observables for the ground state of the Bose gas. We focus on the condensate
fraction and the momentum distribution, and show that they have the same low density asymptotic
behavior as that predicted for the Bose gas. Along with the computation of the low density energy
of the simple equation in our previous paper, this shows that the simple equation reproduces the
known and conjectured properties of the Bose gas at low densities.

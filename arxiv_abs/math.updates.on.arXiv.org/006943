We are interested in solving decision problem $\exists? t \in \mathbb{N}, \cos t \theta = c$ where
$\cos \theta$ and $c$ are algebraic numbers. We call this the $\cos t \theta$ problem. This is an exploration
of Diophantine equations with analytic functions. Polynomial, exponential with real base and
cosine function are closely related to this decision problem: $ \exists ? t \in \mathbb{N}, u^T M^t
v = 0$ where $u, v \in \mathbb{Q}^n, M \in \mathbb{Q}^{n\times n}$. This problem is also known as "Skolem
problem" and is useful in verification of linear systems. Its decidability remains unknown. Single
variable Diophantine equations with exponential function with real algebraic base and $\cos t
\theta$ function with $\theta$ a rational multiple of $\pi$ is decidable. This idea is central in
proving the decidability of Skolem problem when the eigenvalues of $M$ are roots of real numbers.
The main difficulty with the cases when eigenvalues are not roots of reals is that even for small order
cases decidability requires application of trancendental number theory which does not scale for
higher order cases. We provide a first attempt to overcome that by providing a $PTIME$ algorithm
for $\cos t \theta$ when $\theta$ is not a rational multiple of $\pi$. We do so without using techniques
from transcendental number theory. \par One of the main difficulty in Diophantine equations is
being unable to use tools from calculus to solve this equation as the domain of variable is $\mathbb{N}$.
We also provide an attempt to overcome that by providing reduction of Skolem problem to solving a
one variable equation (which involves polynomials, exponentials with real bases and $\cos t \theta$
function with $t$ ranging over reals and $\theta \in [0, \pi]$) over reals.

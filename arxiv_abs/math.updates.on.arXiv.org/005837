We introduce an associative algebra $A^{\infty}(V)$ using infinite matrices with entries in a
grading-restricted vertex algebra $V$ such that the associated graded space $Gr(W)=\coprod_{n\in
\mathbb{N}}Gr_{n}(W)$ of a filtration of a lower-bounded generalized $V$-module $W$ is an $A^{\infty}(V)$-module
satisfying additional properties (called a graded $A^{\infty}(V)$-module). We prove that a lower-bounded
generalized $V$-module $W$ is irreducible or completely reducible if and only if the graded $A^{\infty}(V)$-module
$Gr(W)$ is irreducible or completely reducible, respectively. We also prove that the set of equivalence
classes of the lower-bounded generalized $V$-modules are in bijection with the set of the equivalence
classes of graded $A^{\infty}(V)$-modules. For $N\in \mathbb{N}$, there is a subalgebra $A^{N}(V)$
of $A^{\infty}(V)$ such that the subspace $Gr^{N}(W)=\coprod_{n=0}^{N}Gr_{n}(W)$ of $Gr(W)$
is an $A^{N}(V)$-module satisfying additional properties (called a graded $A^{N}(V)$-module).
We prove that $A^{N}(V)$ are finite dimensional when $V$ is of positive energy (CFT type) and $C_{2}$-cofinite.
We prove that the set of the equivalence classes of lower-bounded generalized $V$-modules is in
bijection with the set of the equivalence classes of graded $A^{N}(V)$-modules. In the case that
$V$ is a M\"{o}bius vertex algebra and the differences between the real parts of the lowest weights
of the irreducible lower-bounded generalized $V$-modules are less than or equal to $N\in \mathbb{N}$,
we prove that a lower-bounded generalized $V$-module $W$ of finite length is irreducible or completely
reducible if and only if the graded $A^{N}(V)$-module $Gr^{N}(W)$ is irreducible or completely
reducible, respectively.

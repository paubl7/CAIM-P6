Given a graph $G=(V,E)$ with a weight $w_v$ associated with each vertex $v\in V$, the maximum weighted
induced forest problem consists of encountering a maximum weighted subset $V'\subseteq V$ of the
vertices such that $V'$ induces a forest. This NP-hard problem is known to be equivalent to the minimum
weighted feedback vertex set problem, which has applicability in a variety of domains. The closely
related maximum weighted induced tree problem, on the other hand, requires that the subset $V'\subseteq
V$ induces a tree. We propose two new integer programming formulations with an exponential number
of constraints and branch-and-cut procedures for the maximum weighted induced forest problem.
Furthermore, we show how formulations for the problem can be very easily adapted to obtain maximum
weighted induced trees. Computational experiments using benchmark instances are performed comparing
several formulations, including the newly proposed approaches and those available in the literature,
when implemented in a standard commercial MIP (mixed integer programming) solver. More specifically,
five formulations are compared, two compact (i.e., with a polynomial number of variables and constraints)
ones and the three others with an exponential number of constraints. The results indicate that one
of the newly proposed formulations, denoted tree with cycle elimination (TCYC), outperforms those
available in the literature when it comes to the average times for proving optimality for the small
instances, especially the more challenging ones. Additionally, this formulation can achieve
much lower average times for solving the larger random instances that can be optimally solved. The
results also illustrate the impact of offering high quality initial feasible solutions in the performance
of the formulations.

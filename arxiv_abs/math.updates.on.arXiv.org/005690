A distance may be defined on a domain of the plane, by considering a suitable set of admissible curves,
and a function $\lambda$ such that its square root is integrable along any admissible curve. More
precisely, to integrate the square root of $\lambda$ gives a notion of length of the curve, and taking
the infimum of these lengths between two points endows the domain with a pseudo-distance. If $\lambda$
is $C^\infty$, one obtains a Riemannian distance. Other basic famous examples are flat metrics
with conical singularities. What should be the good regularity of $\lambda$ to develop a theory
of "Riemannian geometry with low regularity" on surfaces, containing the Riemannian case and the
case of flat metrics? This has been answered in a series of articles by \res in the $60'$s: the logarithm
of $\lambda$ is a difference of subharmonic functions. These distances come with a natural notion
of curvature measure,and a central result in the theory is that, roughly speaking, the converge
of the measures implies the convergence of the distances. On a given domain, the set of subharmonic
distances is exactly the set of the limits (for the uniform convergence) of sequences of Riemannian
distances with uniformly bounded total variation of the curvature measure. In the same period,
A. Huber proved that a distance preserving mapping between domains with subharmonic distances
is a conformal mapping, giving a bridge with the theory of Riemann surfaces. Also, using his convergence
theorem, \res proved that subharmonic distances and two-dimensional manifolds of bounded curvatures,
in the sense of A.D. Alexandrov, are the same thing, providing an analytic approaches to a classical
objects of the theory of metric geometry of surfaces.

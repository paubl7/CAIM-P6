This article is motivated by studying multisensory effects on brain activities in intracranial
electroencephalography (iEEG) experiments. Differential brain activities to multisensory
stimulus presentations are zero in most regions and non-zero in some local regions, yielding locally
sparse functions. Such studies are essentially a function-on-scalar regression problem, with
interest being focused not only on estimating nonparametric functions but also on recovering the
function supports. We propose a weighted group bridge approach for simultaneous function estimation
and support recovery in function-on-scalar mixed effect models, while accounting for heterogeneity
present in functional data. We use B-splines to transform sparsity of functions to its sparse vector
counterpart of increasing dimension, and propose a fast non-convex optimization algorithm using
nested alternative direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for estimation. Large sample properties
are established. In particular, we show that the estimated coefficient functions are rate optimal
in the minimax sense under the $L_2$ norm and resemble a phase transition phenomenon. For support
estimation, we derive a convergence rate under the $L_{\infty}$ norm that leads to a sparsistency
property under $\delta$-sparsity, and provide a simple sufficient regularity condition under
which a strict sparsistency property is established. An adjusted extended Bayesian information
criterion is proposed for parameter tuning. The developed method is illustrated through simulation
and an application to a novel iEEG dataset to study multisensory integration. We integrate the proposed
method into RAVE, an R package that gains increasing popularity in the iEEG community.

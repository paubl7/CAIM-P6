The second author stated the dynamical degree comparison (DDC) conjecture on dynamical correspondences
(which are natural generalizations of dominant rational maps) of smooth projective varieties,
relating the pullback actions of their dynamical iterates on \'etale cohomology groups and on cycle
class groups. This conjecture contains as special cases both the celebrated Weil's Riemann hypothesis
and the positive characteristic analog of Serre's result on polarized endomorphisms. In this paper,
we explore certain motivic analogs of the above DDC conjecture and then propose the spectral radius
comparison (SRC) conjecture and the norm comparison (NC) conjecture. We show some subtleties regarding
these motivic analogs, and that there are some interesting interrelations between these conjectures
and the well-known standard conjectures. As a tool to resolve these conjectures, we propose a quantitative
version of the standard conjecture $C$, named Conjecture $G_r$, which suffices to obtain the DDC
and SRC conjectures for all effective finite correspondences. Under an additional assumption
of the standard conjecture $D$, we show that the DDC and NC conjectures hold. Conjecture $G_r$ and
the standard conjecture $D$, for our purpose, can be regarded as a replacement of the various positivity
notions (forms and currents) in K\"ahler geometry which are currently not available in positive
characteristic. To illustrate the main results, several examples - involving curves, Abelian
varieties, surfaces, threefolds, algebraically stable correspondences, as well as the complex
field case - are given. Along the way, we show that for surfaces and threefolds, cohomological dynamical
degrees are birational invariants, and the DDC conjecture descents to finite quotients.

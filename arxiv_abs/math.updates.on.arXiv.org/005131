This paper presents a techno-economic optimisation tool to study how the power system expansion
decisions can be taken in a more economical and efficient way, by minimising the consequent costs
of network reinforcement and reconfiguration. Analyses are performed to investigate how the network
reinforcement and reconfiguration should be planned, within a time horizon of several years, by
continuously keeping the network feasibility and ability to satisfy the load. The main contribution
of this study is the inclusion of key features within the mathematical model to enhance the investment
decision making process. A representative maintenance cost of existing cables and apparatus is
included, to analyse the influence of the historical performance of the electric items on the investment
decisions. A multihorizon methodology is developed to take into account the long term variation
of the demand, combined with the long term variation of cables maintenance costs. Moreover, technological
learning coefficients are considered, to take into account the investment costs reductions that
arise when an investment in network restructuring and/or reconfiguration is repeated throughout
the years. Finally, construction time constraints are included to find a proper investment scheduling
that allows a feasible power flow, also during the years required to build a new connection or restructure
an existing one. This study is also providing recommendations for future research directions within
the power system reliability field. The analyses show the important and urgent need of proper methodologies
for a better definition of cables projected maintenance costs and learning coefficients dedicated
to network restructuring, reconfiguration and expansion.

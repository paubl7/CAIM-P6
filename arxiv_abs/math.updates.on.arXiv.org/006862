With the increasing number of wireless communication systems and the demand for bandwidth, the
wireless medium has become a congested and contested environment. Operating under such an environment
brings several challenges, especially for military communication systems, which need to guarantee
reliable communication while avoiding interfering with other friendly or neutral systems and
denying the enemy systems of service. In this work, we investigate a novel application of Rate-Splitting
Multiple Access(RSMA) for joint communications and jamming with a Multi-Carrier(MC) waveform
in a multiantenna Cognitive Radio(CR) system. RSMA is a robust multiple access scheme for downlink
multi-antenna wireless networks. RSMA relies on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) at the transmitter
and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receivers. Our aim is to simultaneously
communicate with Secondary Users(SUs) and jam Adversarial Users(AUs) to disrupt their communications
while limiting the interference to Primary Users(PUs) in a setting where all users perform broadband
communications by MC waveforms in their respective networks. We consider the practical setting
of imperfect CSI at transmitter(CSIT) for the SUs and PUs, and statistical CSIT for AUs. We formulate
a problem to obtain optimal precoders which maximize the mutual information under interference
and jamming power constraints. We propose an Alternating Optimization-Alternating Direction
Method of Multipliers(AOADMM) based algorithm for solving the resulting non-convex problem.
We perform an analysis based on Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions to determine the optimal jamming
and interference power thresholds that guarantee the feasibility of problem and propose a practical
algorithm to calculate the interference power threshold. By simulations, we show that RSMA achieves
a higher sum-rate than Space Division Multiple Access(SDMA).

If $k$ is a field, $A$ a finite dimensional $k$-algebra, then the simple $A$-modules form a simple
minded collection in the derived category $\mathscr{D}^{\rm b}(\operatorname{mod}\,A)$. Their
extension closure is $\operatorname{mod}\,A$; in particular, it is abelian. This situation is
emulated by a general simple minded collection $\mathscr{S}$ in a suitable triangulated category
$\mathscr{C}$. In particular, the extension closure $\langle \mathscr{S} \rangle$ is abelian,
and there is a tilting theory for such abelian subcategories of $\mathscr{C}$. These statements
follow from $\langle \mathscr{S} \rangle$ being the heart of a bounded $t$-structure. It is a defining
characteristic of simple minded collections that their negative self extensions vanish in every
degree. Relaxing this to vanishing in degrees $\{ -w+1, \ldots, -1 \}$ where $w$ is a positive integer
leads to the rich, parallel notion of $w$-simple minded systems, which have recently been the subject
of vigorous interest. If $\mathscr{S}$ is a $w$-simple minded system for some $w \geqslant 2$, then
$\langle \mathscr{S} \rangle$ is typically not the heart of a $t$-structure. Nevertheless, using
different methods, we will prove that $\langle \mathscr{S} \rangle$ is abelian and that there is
a tilting theory for such abelian subcategories. Our theory is based on Quillen's notion of exact
categories. The theory of simple minded systems can be viewed as "negative cluster tilting theory".
In particular, the result that $\langle \mathscr{S} \rangle$ is an abelian subcategory is a negative
counterpart to the result from (higher) positive cluster tilting theory that if $\mathscr{T}$
is a cluster tilting subcategory, then $( \mathscr{T} * \Sigma \mathscr{T} )/[ \mathscr{T} ]$ is
an abelian quotient category.

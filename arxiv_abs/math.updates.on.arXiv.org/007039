Evolutionary models used for describing molecular sequence variation suppose that at a non-recombining
genomic segment, sequences share ancestry that can be represented as a genealogy--a rooted, binary,
timed tree, with tips corresponding to individual sequences. Under the in?fitely-many-sites
mutation model, mutations are randomly superimposed along the branches of the genealogy, so that
every mutation occurs at a chromosomal site that has not previously mutated; if a mutation occurs
at an interior branch, then all individuals descending from that branch carry the mutation. The
implication is that observed patterns of molecular variation from this model impose combinatorial
constraints on the hidden state space of genealogies. In particular, observed molecular variation
can be represented in the form of a perfect phylogeny, a tree structure that fully encodes the mutational
differences among sequences. For a sample of n sequences, a perfect phylogeny might not possess
n distinct leaves, and hence might be compatible with many possible binary tree structures that
could describe the evolutionary relationships among the n sequences. Here, we investigate enumerative
properties of the set of binary ranked and unranked tree shapes that are compatible with a perfect
phylogeny, and hence, the binary ranked and unranked tree shapes conditioned on an observed pattern
of mutations under the in?nitely-many-sites mutation model. We provide a recursive enumeration
of these shapes. We consider both perfect phylogenies that can be represented as binary and those
that are multifurcating. The results have implications for computational aspects of the statistical
inference of evolutionary parameters that underlie sets of molecular sequences.

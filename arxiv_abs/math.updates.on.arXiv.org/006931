In this paper an approach to joint source-channel coding (JSCC) named Shannon-Kotel'nikov mappings
(S-K mappings) is presented. S-K mappings are continuous, or piecewise continuous direct source-to-channel
mappings operating directly on amplitude continuous and discrete time signals. Such mappings
include several existing JSCC schemes as special cases. Many existing approaches to analog- or
hybrid discrete analog JSCC provide both excellent performance as well as robustness to variations
in noise level. This at low delay and relatively low complexity. However, a theory explaining their
performance and behaviour on a general basis, as well as guidelines on how to construct close to optimal
mappings in general, does not currently exist. Therefore, such mappings are often found based on
educated guesses inspired of configurations that are known in advance to produce good solutions,
combination of already existing mappings, numerical optimization or machine learning methods.
The objective of this paper is to introduce a theoretical framework for analysis of analog- or hybrid
discrete analog S-K mappings. This framework will enable calculation of distortion when applying
such schemes on point-to-point links, reveal more about their fundamental nature, and provide
guidelines on how they should be constructed in order to perform well at both low and arbitrary complexity
and delay. Such guidelines will likely help constrain solutions to numerical approaches and help
explain why machine learning approaches finds the solutions they do. This task is difficult and
we do not provide a complete framework at this stage: We focus on high SNR and memoryless sources with
an arbitrary continuous unimodal density function and memoryless Gaussian channels. We also provide
example of mappings based on surfaces which are chosen based on the provided theory.

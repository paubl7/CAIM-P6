We investigate the performance of multi-user multiple-antenna downlink systems in which a BS serves
multiple users via a shared wireless medium. In order to fully exploit the spatial diversity while
minimizing the passive energy consumed by radio frequency (RF) components, the BS is equipped with
M RF chains and N antennas, where M < N. Upon receiving pilot sequences to obtain the channel state
information, the BS determines the best subset of M antennas for serving the users. We propose a joint
antenna selection and precoding design (JASPD) algorithm to maximize the system sum rate subject
to a transmit power constraint and QoS requirements. The JASPD overcomes the non-convexity of the
formulated problem via a doubly iterative algorithm, in which an inner loop successively optimizes
the precoding vectors, followed by an outer loop that tries all valid antenna subsets. Although
approaching the (near) global optimality, the JASPD suffers from a combinatorial complexity,
which may limit its application in real-time network operations. To overcome this limitation,
we propose a learning-based antenna selection and precoding design algorithm (L-ASPA), which
employs a DNN to establish underlaying relations between the key system parameters and the selected
antennas. The proposed L-ASPD is robust against the number of users and their locations, BS's transmit
power, as well as the small-scale channel fading. With a well-trained learning model, it is shown
that the L-ASPD significantly outperforms baseline schemes based on the block diagonalization
and a learning-assisted solution for broadcasting systems and achieves higher effective sum rate
than that of the JASPA under limited processing time. In addition, we observed that the proposed
L-ASPD can reduce the computation complexity by 95% while retaining more than 95% of the optimal
performance.

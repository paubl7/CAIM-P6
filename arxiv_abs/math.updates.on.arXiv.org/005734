Recently proposed adaptive Sketch & Project (SP) methods connect several well-known projection
methods such as Randomized Kaczmarz (RK), Randomized Block Kaczmarz (RBK), Motzkin Relaxation
(MR), Randomized Coordinate Descent (RCD), Capped Coordinate Descent (CCD), etc. into one framework
for solving linear systems. In this work, we first propose a Stochastic Steepest Descent (SSD) framework
that connects SP methods with the well-known Steepest Descent (SD) method for solving positive-definite
linear system of equations. We then introduce two greedy sampling strategies in the SSD framework
that allow us to obtain algorithms such as Sampling Kaczmarz Motzkin (SKM), Sampling Block Kaczmarz
(SBK), Sampling Coordinate Descent (SCD), etc. In doing so, we generalize the existing sampling
rules into one framework and develop an efficient version of SP methods. Furthermore, we incorporated
the Polyak momentum technique into the SSD method to accelerate the resulting algorithms. We provide
global convergence results for both the SSD method and the momentum induced SSD method. Moreover,
we prove $\mathcal{O}(\frac{1}{k})$ convergence rate for the Cesaro average of iterates generated
by both methods. By varying parameters in the SSD method, we obtain classical convergence results
of the SD method as well as the SP methods as special cases. We design computational experiments to
demonstrate the performance of the proposed greedy sampling methods as well as the momentum methods.
The proposed greedy methods significantly outperform the existing methods for a wide variety of
datasets such as random test instances as well as real-world datasets (LIBSVM, sparse datasets
from matrix market collection). Finally, the momentum algorithms designed in this work accelerate
the algorithmic performance of the SSD methods.

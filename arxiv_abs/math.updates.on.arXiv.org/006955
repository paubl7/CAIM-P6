We consider an Erdos-Renyi random graph consisting of N vertices connected by randomly and independently
drawing an edge between every pair of them with probability c/N so that at N->infinity one obtains
a graph of finite mean degree c. In this regime, we study the distribution of resistance distances
between the vertices of this graph and develop an auxiliary field representation for this quantity
in the spirit of statistical field theory. Using this representation, a saddle point evaluation
of the resistance distance distribution is possible at N->infinity in terms of an 1/c expansion.
The leading order of this expansion captures the results of numerical simulations very well down
to rather small values of c; for example, it recovers the empirical distribution at c=4 or 6 with an
overlap of around 90%. At large values of c, the distribution tends to a Gaussian of mean 2/c and standard
deviation sqrt{2/c^3}. At small values of c, the distribution is skewed toward larger values, as
captured by our saddle point analysis, and many fine features appear in addition to the main peak,
including subleading peaks that can be traced back to resistance distances between vertices of
specific low degrees and the rest of the graph. We develop a more refined saddle point scheme that
extracts the corresponding degree-differentiated resistance distance distributions. We then
use this approach to recover analytically the most apparent of the subleading peaks that originates
from vertices of degree 1. Rather intuitively, this subleading peak turns out to be a copy of the main
peak, shifted by one unit of resistance distance and scaled down by the probability for a vertex to
have degree 1. We comment on a possible lack of smoothness in the true N->infinity distribution suggested
by the numerics.

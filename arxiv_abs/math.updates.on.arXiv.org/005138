The topics treated in this thesis are inherently two-fold. The first part considers the problem
of a market maker optimally setting bid/ask quotes over a finite time horizon, to maximize her expected
utility. The intensities of the orders she receives depend not only on the spreads she quotes, but
also on unobservable factors modelled by a hidden Markov chain. This stochastic control problem
under partial information is solved by means of stochastic filtering, control and PDMPs theory.
The value function is characterized as the unique continuous viscosity solution of its dynamic
programming equation and numerically compared with its full information counterpart. The optimal
full information spreads are shown to be biased when the exact market regime is unknown, as the market
maker needs to adjust for additional regime uncertainty in terms of PnL sensitivity and observable
order flow volatility. The second part deals with numerically solving nonzero-sum stochastic
impulse control games. These offer a realistic and far-reaching modelling framework, but the difficulty
in solving such problems has hindered their proliferation. A policy-iteration-type solver is
proposed to solve an underlying system of quasi-variational inequalities, and it is validated
numerically with reassuring results. Eventually, the focus is put on games with a symmetric structure
and an improved algorithm is put forward. A rigorous convergence analysis is undertaken with natural
assumptions on the players strategies, which admit graph-theoretic interpretations in the context
of weakly chained diagonally dominant matrices. The algorithm is used to compute with high precision
equilibrium payoffs and Nash equilibria of otherwise too challenging problems, and even some for
which results go beyond the scope of the currently available theory.

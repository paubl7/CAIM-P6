Privacy-preserving data release mechanisms aiming to minimize the privacy leakage under utility
constraints of nonspecific tasks are studied through the lens of information theory. An information
theoretic framework extending Sankar et al. [1] is proposed. While the private feature to be protected
is typically determined and known by the users who release their data, the specific task where the
release data is utilized is usually unknown. To address the lack of information of the specific task,
utility constraints laid on a set of multiple possible tasks are considered. The mechanism protects
the privacy of a given feature of the to-be-released data while satisfying utility constraints
of all possible tasks in the set. First, the single-letter characterization of the privacy-utility
tradeoff region is derived. Characterization of the minimum privacy under log-loss utility constraints
turns out to be a non-convex optimization problem involving mutual information in the objective
function and the constraints. Second, focusing on the case where the raw data consists of multiple
independent components, we show that the above optimization problem can be decomposed into multiple
parallel privacy funnel (PF) problems [2] with different weightings, each of which includes only
a single utility constraint. We explicitly derive the optimal solution to each PF problem when the
private feature is a deterministic function of a data component. The solution is characterized
by the leakage-free threshold, and the minimum leakage is zero while the utility constraint is below
the threshold. Once the utility requirement is above the threshold, the privacy leakage increases
linearly. Finally, we show that the optimal weighting of each privacy funnel problem can be found
by solving a linear program (LP). Numerical results are shown to illustrate the robustness of our
approach.

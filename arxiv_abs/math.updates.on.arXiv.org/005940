A new representation of splines that targets efficiency in the analysis of functional data is implemented.
The efficiency is achieved through two novel features: using the recently introduced orthonormal
spline bases, the so-called {\it splinets} and accounting for the spline support sets in the proposed
spline object representation. The recently-introduced orthogonal splinets are evaluated by
{\it dyadic orthogonalization} of the $B$-splines. The package is built around the {\it Splinets}-object
that represents a collection of splines. It treats splines as mathematical functions and contains
information about the support sets and the values of the derivatives at the knots that uniquely define
these functions. Algebra and calculus of splines utilize the Taylor expansions at the knots within
the support sets. Several orthonormalization procedures of the $B$-splines are implemented including
the recommended dyadic method leading to the splinets. The method bases on a dyadic algorithm that
can be also viewed as the efficient method of diagonalizing a band matrix. The locality of the $B$-splines
in terms of the support sets is, to a great extend, preserved in the corresponding splinet. This together
with implemented algorithms utilizing locality of the supports provides a valuable computational
tool for functional data analysis. The benefits are particularly evident when the sparsity in the
data plays an important role. Various diagnostic tools are provided allowing to maintain the stability
of the computations. Finally, the projection operation to the space of splines is implemented that
facilitates functional data analysis. An example of a simple functional analysis of the data using
the tools in the package is presented. The functionality of the package extends beyond the splines
to piecewise polynomial functions, although the splines are its focus.

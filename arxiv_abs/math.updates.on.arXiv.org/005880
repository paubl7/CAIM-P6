Let $G$ be a real semisimple Lie group with finite center and let $\mathfrak g=\mathfrak k \oplus
\mathfrak p$ be a Cartan decomposition of its Lie algebra. Let $K$ be a maximal compact subgroup of
$G$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak k$ and let $\tau$ be an irreducible representation of $G$ on a complex
vector space $V$. Let $h$ be a Hermitian scalar product on $V$ such that $\tau(G)$ is compatible with
respect to $\mathrm{U}(V,h)^{\mathbb C}$. We denote by $\mu_{\mathfrak p}:\mathbb P(V) \longrightarrow
\mathfrak p$ the $G$-gradient map and by $\mathcal O$ the unique closed orbit of $G$ in $\mathbb P(V)$,
which is a $K$-orbit, contained in the unique closed orbit of the Zariski closure of $\tau(G)$ in
$\mathrm{U}(V,h)^{\mathbb C}$. We prove that up to equivalence the set of irreducible representations
of parabolic subgroups of $G$ induced by $\tau$ are completely determined by the facial structure
of the polar orbitope $\mathcal E=\mathrm{conv}(\mu_{\mathfrak p} (\mathcal O))$. Moreover,
any parabolic subgroup of $G$ admits a unique closed orbit which is well-adapted to $\mathcal O$
and $\mu_{\mathfrak p}$ respectively. These results are new also in the complex reductive case.
The connection between $\mathcal E$ and $\tau$ provides a geometrical description of the Satake
compactifications without root data. In this context the properties of the Bourguignon-Li-Yau
map are also investigated. Given a measure $\gamma$ on $\mathcal O$, we construct a map $\Psi_\gamma$
from the Satake compactification of $G/K$ associated to $\tau$ and $\mathcal E$. If $\gamma$ is
a $K$-invariant measure then $\Psi_\gamma$ is an homeomorphism of the Satake compactification
and $\mathcal E$. Finally, we prove that for a large class of measures the map $\Psi_\gamma$ is surjective.

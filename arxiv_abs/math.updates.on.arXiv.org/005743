The ever-growing popularity and rapid improving of artificial intelligence (AI) have raised rethinking
on the evolution of wireless networks. Mobile edge computing (MEC) provides a natural platform
for AI applications since it is with rich computation resources to train machine learning (ML) models,
as well as low-latency access to the data generated by mobile and internet of things (IoT) devices.
In this paper, we present an infrastructure to perform ML tasks at an MEC server with the assistance
of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS). In contrast to conventional communication systems
where the principal criterions are to maximize the throughput, we aim at maximizing the learning
performance. Specifically, we minimize the maximum learning error of all participating users
by jointly optimizing transmit power of mobile users, beamforming vectors of the base station (BS),
and the phase-shift matrix of the RIS. An alternating optimization (AO)-based framework is proposed
to optimize the three terms iteratively, where a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based
algorithm is developed to solve the power allocation problem, closed-form expressions of the beamforming
vectors are derived, and an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based algorithm
is designed together with an error level searching (ELS) framework to effectively solve the challenging
nonconvex optimization problem of the phase-shift matrix. Simulation results demonstrate significant
gains of deploying an RIS and validate the advantages of our proposed algorithms over various benchmarks.
Lastly, a unified communication-training-inference platform is developed based on the CARLA
platform and the SECOND network, and a use case (3D object detection in autonomous driving) for the
proposed scheme is demonstrated on the developed platform.

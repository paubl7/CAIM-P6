We prove a finite-dimensional covariant Stinespring theorem for compact quantum groups. Let G
be a compact quantum group, and let T:= Rep(G) be the rigid C*-tensor category of finite-dimensional
continuous unitary representations of G. Let Mod(T) be the rigid C*-2-category of cofinite semisimple
finitely decomposable T-module categories. We show that finite-dimensional G-C*-algebras can
be identified with equivalence classes of 1-morphisms out of the object T in Mod(T). For 1-morphisms
X: T -> M1, Y: T -> M2, we show that covariant completely positive maps between the corresponding G-C*-algebras
can be 'dilated' to isometries t: X -> Y \otimes E, where E: M2 -> M1 is some 'environment' 1-morphism.
Dilations are unique up to partial isometry on the environment; in particular, the dilation minimising
the quantum dimension of the environment is unique up to a unitary. When G is a compact group this implies
and generalises previous covariant Stinespring-type theorems. To provide a theoretical foundation
for these results we study rigid C*-2-categories. We say that a rigid C*-2-category is presemisimple
if it is locally semisimple and additive, and every object decomposes as a finite direct sum of simple
objects. We extend the notion of standard duals to this setting, and thereby prove that any presemisimple
rigid C*-2-category is a pivotal dagger 2-category. We say that a presemisimple rigid C*-2-category
is semisimple if all special standard Frobenius algebras in all endomorphism categories are pairs
of pants. We show that, for any rigid C*-tensor category T, the 2-category Mod(T) and the 2-category
Bimod(T) of special standard Frobenius algebras, dagger bimodules and bimodule homomorphisms
in T are equivalent semisimple rigid C*-2-categories. We show that in fact every connected semisimple
rigid C*-2-category is equivalent to Mod(T) for some rigid C*-tensor category T.

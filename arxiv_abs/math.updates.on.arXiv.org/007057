Failure trajectories, identifying the probable failure zones, and damage statistics are some
of the key quantities of relevance in brittle fracture applications. High-fidelity numerical
solvers that reliably estimate these relevant quantities exist but they are computationally demanding
requiring a high resolution of the crack. Moreover, independent intensive simulations need to
be carried out even for a small change in domain parameters and/or material properties. Therefore,
fast and generalizable surrogate models are needed to alleviate the computational burden but the
discontinuous nature of fracture mechanics presents a major challenge to developing such models.
We propose a physics-informed variational formulation of DeepONet (V-DeepONet) for brittle fracture
analysis. V-DeepONet is trained to map the initial configuration of the defect to the relevant fields
of interests (e.g., damage and displacement fields). Once the network is trained, the entire global
solution can be rapidly obtained for any initial crack configuration and loading steps on that domain.
While the original DeepONet is solely data-driven, we take a different path to train the V-DeepONet
by imposing the governing equations in variational form and we also use some labelled data. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of V-DeepOnet through two benchmarks of brittle fracture, and we verify its accuracy
using results from high-fidelity solvers. Encoding the physical laws and also some data to train
the network renders the surrogate model capable of accurately performing both interpolation and
extrapolation tasks, considering that fracture modeling is very sensitive to fluctuations. The
proposed hybrid training of V-DeepONet is superior to state-of-the-art methods and can be applied
to a wide array of dynamical systems with complex responses.

This paper proposes a novel approach to improve the performance of a heterogeneous network (HetNet)
supported by dual connectivity (DC) by adopting multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) as passive
relays that carry reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). More specifically, RISs are deployed
under the UAVs termed as UAVs-RISs that operate over the micro-wave ($\mu$W) channel in the sky to
sustain a strong line-of-sight (LoS) connection with the ground users. The macro-cell operates
over the $\mu$W channel based on orthogonal multiple access (OMA), while small base stations (SBSs)
operate over the millimeter-wave (mmW) channel based on non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA).
We study the problem of total transmit power minimization by jointly optimizing the trajectory/velocity
of each UAV, RISs' phase shifts, subcarrier allocations, and active beamformers at each BS. The
underlying problem is highly non-convex and the global optimal solution is intractable. To handle
it, we decompose the original problem into two subproblems, i.e., a subproblem which deals with
the UAVs' trajectories/velocities, RISs' phase shifts, and subcarrier allocations for $\mu$W;
and a subproblem for active beamforming design and subcarrier allocation for mmW. In particular,
we solve the first subproblem via the dueling deep Q-Network (DQN) learning approach by developing
a distributed algorithm which leads to a better policy evaluation. Then, we solve the active beamforming
design and subcarrier allocation for the mmW via the successive convex approximation (SCA) method.
Simulation results exhibit the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation scheme compared
to other baseline schemes. In particular, it is revealed that by deploying UAVs-RISs, the transmit
power can be reduced by 6 dBm while maintaining similar guaranteed QoS.

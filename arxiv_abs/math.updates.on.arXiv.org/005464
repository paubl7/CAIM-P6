We continue the study of topological nonrelativistic quantum gravity associated with a family
of Ricci flow equations on Riemannian manifolds. This topological gravity is of the cohomological
type, and it exhibits an ${\cal N}=2$ extended BRST symmetry. In our previous work, we constructed
this theory in a two-step procedure in the appropriate nonrelativistic ${\cal N}=2$ superspace,
first presenting a topological theory of the spatial metric $g_{ij}$, and then adding the superspace
versions of the lapse and shift variables $n$ and $n^i$ while gauging the symmetries of foliation-preserving
spacetime diffeomorphisms. In the relation to Perelman's theory of the Ricci flow, the role of Perelman's
dilaton is played by our nonprojectable lapse. Here we demonstrate that this construction is equivalent
to a standard one-step BRST gauge-fixing of a theory whose fields are $g_{ij}$, $n^i$ and $n$, and
whose gauge symmetries consist of (i) the topological deformations of $g_{ij}$, and (ii) the ultralocal
nonrelativistic limit of spacetime diffeomorphisms. The supercharge $Q$ of our superspace construction
plays the role of the BRST charge. The spacetime diffeomorphism symmetries appear in an interestingly
"shifted" form, which may be of broader interest for nonrelativistic quantum gravity outside of
the present topological context. In contrast to the foliation-preserving spacetime diffeomorphisms,
the gauge symmetries identified in this paper act nonprojectably on time, making it clear that this
theory has no local propagating degrees of freedom. We point out an intriguing dual interpretation
of the same theory, as a gauge fixing of a dual copy of ultralocal spacetime diffeomorphisms, with
the role of ghosts and antighosts interchanged and the second supercharge $\bar Q$ of the ${\cal
N}=2$ superalgebra playing the role of the BRST charge in the dual picture.

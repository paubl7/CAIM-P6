We introduce a natural filtration on the simplicial homology of a finite simplicial complex $X$
using bi-colourings of its vertices. This yields two dual homology theories, which generalise
simplicial homology and are closely related to discrete Morse matchings on $X$. We give an explicit
expression for the associated graded object of these homologies when $X$ is the matching complex
of the Tait graph of a plane graph $G$, in terms of subgraphs determined by certain matchings on the
dual of $G$. We then use one of these homologies, in the case where $X$ is a graph, to define a conjecturally
optimal dissimilarity pseudometric for graphs; we prove various results for this dissimilarity
and provide several computations. We further show that, by organising the horizontal homologies
of a simplicial complex in the poset of its colourings, we obtain a triply graded homology theory
which we call \"uberhomology. This latter homology is not a homotopy invariant, but nonetheless
encodes both combinatorial and topological information on $X$. For example we prove that if $X$
is a subdivision, the \"uberhomology vanishes in its lowest degree, while for an homology manifold
it coincides with the fundamental class in its top degree. We compute the \"uberhomology on several
classes of examples and infinite families, and prove some of its properties; namely that, in its
extremal degrees, it is well behaved under coning and taking suspension. We then focus on the case
where $X$ is a simple graph, and prove a detection result. Finally, we define some singly-graded
homologies for graphs obtained by specialising the \"uberhomology in certain bi-degrees, provide
some computations and use computer aided calculations to make some conjectures.

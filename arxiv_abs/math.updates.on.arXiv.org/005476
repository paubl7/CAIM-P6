Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have played an important role in wireless communications due to
the advantages such as highly controllable mobility in three-dimensional (3D) space, swift deployment,
line-of-sight (LoS) aerial-ground links, and so on. In this paper, we consider a UAV-enabled two-way
relaying system where the UAV relay assists the information exchange between two ground users (GUs)
under three different schemes, i.e., four-slot multi-hopping (FSMH) without network coding (NC),
three-slot NC and two-slot physical NC (PNC). Firstly, the capacity region of each scheme in this
relaying system is analyzed. Then, we maximize the system average sum rate by jointly optimizing
the time resources allocation, transmission powers of the transceivers, and the UAV trajectory
subject to the constraints on UAV mobility and information causality under each scheme. To solve
those problems, we propose an iterative algorithm by applying the successive convex approximation
and block coordinate descent techniques. Specifically, the time resources allocation, transmission
powers and the UAV trajectory are alternatively optimized in each iteration. In addition, the nonconvex
trajectory optimization problem is solved by successively solving an approximate convex optimization
problem. To gain more insights, we also investigate the performance of those three schemes with
symmetric and asymmetric traffic respectively by introducing a new traffic pattern constraint.
Numerical results show that the proposed relaying schemes with moving relay can achieve great throughput
gains as compared to the conventional scheme with static relay. The three relay schemes also show
great performance heterogeneity under different traffic patterns.

Even though the Hamiltonian cycle problem is NP-complete, many of its problem instances aren't.
In fact, almost all the hard instances reside in one area: near the Koml\'os-Szemer\'edi bound,
of $\frac{1}{2}\ v\cdot ln(v) + \frac{1}{2}\ v\cdot ln( ln(v))$ edges, where randomly generated
graphs have an approximate 50\% chance of being Hamiltonian. If the number of edges is either much
higher or much lower, the problem is not hard -- most backtracking algorithms decide such instances
in (near) polynomial time. Recently however, targeted search efforts have identified very hard
Hamiltonian cycle problem instances very far away from the Koml\'os-Szemer\'edi bound. In that
study, the used backtracking algorithm was Vandegriend-Culberson's, which was supposedly the
most efficient of all Hamiltonian backtracking algorithms. In this paper, we make a unified large
scale quantitative comparison for the best known backtracking algorithms described between 1877
and 2016. We confirm the suspicion that the Koml\'os-Szemer\'edi bound is a hard area for all backtracking
algorithms, but also that Vandegriend-Culberson is indeed the most efficient algorithm, when
expressed in consumed computing time. When measured in recursive effectiveness however, the algorithm
by Frank Rubin, almost half a century old, performs best. In a more general algorithmic assessment,
we conjecture that edge pruning and non-Hamiltonicity checks might be largely responsible for
these recursive savings. When expressed in system time however, denser problem instances require
much more time per recursion. This is most likely due to the costliness of the extra search pruning
procedures, which are relatively elaborate. We supply large amounts of experimental data, and
a unified single-program implementation for all six algorithms. All data and algorithmic source
code is made public for further use by our colleagues.

Three-Dimensional Stationary Spherically Symmetric Stellar Dynamic Models Depending on the
Local Energy. Juergen Batt, Enno Joern, Alexander L. Skubachevskii The stellar dynamic models
considered here are triples (f,rho,U) of three functions: the distribution function f=f(r,u),
the local density rho=rho(r) and the Newtonian potential U=U(r), where r:=|x|, u:=|v| ((x,v) in
R^3xR^3 are the space-velocity coordinates), and f is a function q of the local energy E=U(r)+u^2/2.
Our first result is an answer to the following question: Given a (positive) function p=p(r) on a bounded
interval [0,R], how can one recognize p as the local density of a stellar dynamic model of the given
type ("inverse problem")? If this is the case, we say that p is "extendable" (to a complete stellar
dynamic model). Assuming that p is strictly decreasing, we reveal the connection between p and F,
which appears in the nonlinear integral equation p=FU[p] and the solvability of Eddington's equation
between F and q. Second, we investigate the following question ("direct problem"): Which q induce
distribution functions f of the form f=q(-E(r,u)-E0) of a stellar dynamic model? This leads to the
investigation of the nonlinear equation p=FU[p] in an approximate and constructive way by mainly
numerical methods. The paper extends preceding work on flat galaxies to the three-dimensional
case. In particular, the present answer to the extendability problem is completely different as
in [1]. The present paper also opens the way to further explicit solutions of the Vlasov-Poisson
system beyond the classical known examples which are for instant given in [4]. Keywords: Vlasov-Poisson
system, stationary solutions, numerical approximation, mathematical physic, galaxy astrophysics.

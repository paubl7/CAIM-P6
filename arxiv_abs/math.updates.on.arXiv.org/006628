Probing is a general technique that is used to reduce the variance of the Hutchinson stochastic estimator
for the trace of the inverse of a large, sparse matrix $A$. The variance of the estimator is the sum
of the squares of the off-diagonal elements of $A^{-1}$. Therefore, this technique computes probing
vectors that when used in the estimator they annihilate the largest off-diagonal elements. For
matrices that display decay of the magnitude of $|A^{-1}_{ij}|$ with the graph distance between
nodes $i$ and $j$, this is achieved through graph coloring of increasing powers $A^p$. Equivalently,
when a matrix stems from a lattice discretization, it is computationally beneficial to find a distance-$p$
coloring of the lattice. In this work, we study probing for the more general problem of computing
the trace of a permutation of $A^{-1}$, say $PA^{-1}$, motivated from Lattice QCD where we need to
construct "disconnected diagrams" to extract flavor-separated Generalized Parton functions.
In Lattice QCD, where the matrix has a 4D toroidal lattice structure, these non-local operators
correspond to a $PA^{-1}$ where $P$ is the permutation relating to some displacement in one or more
dimensions. We focus on a single dimension displacement ($k$) but our methods are general. We show
that probing on $A^p$ or $(PA)^p$ do not annihilate the largest magnitude elements. To resolve this
issue, our displacement-based probing works on $PA^p$ using a new coloring scheme that works directly
on appropriately displaced neighborhoods on the lattice. We prove lower bounds on the number of
colors needed, and study the effect of this scheme on variance reduction, both theoretically and
experimentally on a real-world Lattice QCD calculation. We achieve orders of magnitude speedup
over the un-probed or the naively probed methods.

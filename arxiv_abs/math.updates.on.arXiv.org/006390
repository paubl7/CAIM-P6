We prove universality of spin correlations in the scaling limit of the planar Ising model on isoradial
graphs with uniformly bounded angles and Z-invariant weights. Specifically, we show that in the
massive scaling limit, i.e., as the mesh size $\delta$ tends to zero at the same rate as the inverse
temperature goes to the critical one, the two-point spin correlations in the full plane behave as
\[ \delta^{-\frac{1}{4}}\mathbb{E}\left[\sigma_{u_{1}}\sigma_{u_{2}}\right]\ \to\ C_{\sigma}^{2}\cdot\Xi\left(|u_{1}-u_{2}|,m\right)\quad\text{as}\quad\delta\to0,
\] where the universal constant $C_{\sigma}$ and the function $\Xi(|u_{1}-u_{2}|,m)$ are independent
of the lattice. The mass $m$ is defined by the relation $k'-1\sim 4m\delta$, where $k'$ is the Baxter
elliptic parameter. This includes $m$ of both signs as well as the critical case when $\Xi(r,0)=r^{-1/4}.$
These results, together with techniques developed to obtain them, are sufficient to extend to isoradial
graphs the convergence of multi-point spin correlations in finite planar domains on the square
grid, which was established in a joint work of the first two authors and C. Hongler at criticality,
and by S.C. Park in the sub-critical massive regime. We also give a simple proof of the fact that the
infinite-volume magnetization in the Z-invariant model is independent of the site and of the lattice.
As compared to techniques already existing in the literature, we streamline the analysis of discrete
(massive) holomorphic spinors near their ramification points, relying only upon discrete analogues
of the kernel $z^{-1/2}$ for $m=0$ and of $z^{-1/2}e^{\pm 2m|z|}$ for $m\ne 0$. Enabling the generalization
to isoradial graphs and providing a solid ground for further generalizations, our approach also
considerably simplifies the proofs in the square lattice setup.

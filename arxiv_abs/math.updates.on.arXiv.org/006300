We study d-dimensional generalizations of three mutually related topics in graph theory: Hamiltonian
paths, (unit) interval graphs, and binomial edge ideals. We provide partial high-dimensional
generalizations of Ore and Posa's sufficient conditions for a graph to be Hamiltonian. We introduce
a hierarchy of combinatorial properties for simplicial complexes that generalize unit-interval,
interval, and co-comparability graphs. We connect these properties to the already existing notions
of determinantal facet ideals and Hamiltonian paths in simplicial complexes. Some important consequences
of our work are: (1) Every almost-closed strongly-connected d-dimensional simplicial complex
is traceable. (This extends the well-known result "unit-interval connected graphs are traceable".)
(2) Every almost-closed d-complex that remains strongly connected after the deletion of d or less
vertices, is Hamiltonian. (This extends the fact that "unit-interval 2-connected graphs are Hamiltonian".)
(3) Unit-interval complexes are characterized, among traceable complexes, by the property that
the minors defining their determinantal facet ideal form a Groebner basis for a diagonal term order
which is compatible with the traceability of the complex. (This corrects a recent theorem by Ene
et al., extends a result by Herzog and others, and partially answers a question by Almousa-Vandebogert.)
(4) Only the d-skeleton of the simplex has a determinantal facet ideal with linear resolution. (This
extends the result by Kiani and Saeedi-Madani that "only the complete graph has a binomial edge ideal
with linear resolution".) (5) The determinantal facet ideals of all under-closed and semi-closed
complexes have a square-free initial ideal with respect to lex. In characteristic p, they are even
F-pure.

In his paper, we present order reduction techniques for nonlinear quasi-periodic systems subjected
to external excitations. The order reduction techniques presented here are based on the Lyapunov-Perrone
(L-P) Transformation. For a class of non-resonant quasi-periodic systems, the L-P transformation
can convert a linear quasi-periodic system into a linear time-invariant one. This Linear Time-Invariant
(LTI) system retains the dynamics of the original quasi-periodic system. Once this LTI system is
obtained, the tools and techniques available for analysis of LTI systems can be used, and the results
could be obtained for the original quasi-periodic system via the L-P transformation. This approach
is similar to using the Lyapunov-Floquet (L-F) transformation to convert a linear time-periodic
system into an LTI system and perform analysis and control. Order reduction is a systematic way of
constructing dynamical system models with relatively smaller states that accurately retain large-scale
systems' essential dynamics. In this work, reduced-order modeling techniques for nonlinear quasi-periodic
systems subjected to external excitations are presented. The methods proposed here use the L-P
transformation that makes the linear part of transformed equations time-invariant. In this work,
two order reduction techniques are suggested. The first method is simply an application of the well-known
Guyan like reduction method to nonlinear systems. The second technique is based on the concept of
an invariant manifold for quasi-periodic systems. The 'quasi-periodic invariant manifold' based
technique yields' reducibility conditions.' These conditions help us to understand the various
types of resonant interactions in the system. These resonances indicate energy interactions between
the system states, nonlinearity, and external excitation.

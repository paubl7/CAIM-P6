This paper presents a thoroughgoing interpretation of a weak relevant logic built over the Dunn-Belnap
four-valued semantics in terms of the communication of information in a network of sites of knowledge
production (laboratories). The knowledge communicated concerns experimental data and the regularities
tested using it. There have been many nods to interpretations similar to ours - for example, in Dunn
(1976), Belnap (1977). The laboratory interpretation was outlined in Bilkova et al. (2010). Our
system is built on the Routley--Meyer semantics for relevant logic equipped with a four-valued
valuation of formulas, where labs stand in for situations, and the four values reflect the complexity
of assessing results of experiments. This semantics avoids using the Routley star, on the cost of
introducing a further relation, required in evaluating falsity assignments of implication. We
can however provide a natural interpretation of two accessibility relations - confirmation and
refutation of hypotheses are two independent processes in our laboratory setup. This setup motivates
various basic properties of the accessibility relations, as well as a number of other possible restrictions.
This gives us a flexible modular system which can be adjusted to specific epistemic contexts. As
perfect regularities are rarely, or perhaps never, actually observed, we add probabilities to
the logical framework. As our logical framework is non-classical, the probability is non-classical
as well, satisfying a weaker version of Kolmogorov axioms (cf. Priest 2006). We show that these probabilities
allow for a relative frequency as well as for a subjective interpretation (we provide a Dutch book
argument). We further show how to update the probabilities and to distinguish conditional probabilities
from the probability of conditionals.

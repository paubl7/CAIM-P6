The Yangian $Y(\mathfrak{g})$ of a simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ can be regarded as a deformation
of two different Hopf algebras: the universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{g}[t])$ and the
coordinate ring of the first congruence subgroup $\mathcal{O}(G_1[[t^{-1}]])$. Both of these
algebras are obtained from the Yangian by taking the associated graded with respect to an appropriate
filtration on Yangian. Bethe subalgebras form a natural family of commutative subalgebras depending
on a group element $C$ of the adjoint group $G$. The images of these algebras in tensor products of
fundamental representations give all integrals of the quantum XXX Heisenberg magnet chain. We
describe the associated graded of Bethe subalgebras as subalgebras in $U(\mathfrak{g}[t])$ and
in $\mathcal{O}(G_1[[t^{-1}]])$ for all semisimple $C\in G$. We show that associated graded in
$U(\mathfrak{g}[t])$ of the Bethe subalgebra assigned to the identity of $G$ is the universal Gaudin
subalgebra of $U(\mathfrak{g}[t])$ obtained from the center of the corresponding affine Kac-Moody
algebra at the critical level. This generalizes Talalaev's formula for generators of the universal
Gaudin subalgebra to $\mathfrak{g}$ of any type. In particular, this shows that higher Hamiltonians
of the Gaudin magnet chain can be quantized without referring to the Feigin-Frenkel center at the
critical level. Using our general result on associated graded of Bethe subalgebras, we compute
some limits of Bethe subalgebras corresponding to regular semisimple $C\in G$ as $C$ goes to an irregular
semisimple group element $C_0$. We show that this limit is the product of the smaller Bethe subalgebra
and a quantum shift of argument subalgebra in the universal enveloping algebra of the centralizer
of $C_0$ in $\mathfrak{g}$. This generalizes the Nazarov-Olshansky solution of Vinberg's problem
on quantization of shift of argument subalgebras.

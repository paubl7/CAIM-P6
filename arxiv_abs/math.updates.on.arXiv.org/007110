In this paper, we investigate the initial-boundary value problem to the heat conductive compressible
Navier-Stokes equations. Local existence and uniqueness of strong solutions is established with
any such initial data that the initial density $\rho_0$, velocity $u_0$, and temperature $\theta_0$
satisfy $\rho_0\in W^{1,q}$, with $q\in(3,6)$, $u_0\in H^1$, and $\sqrt{\rho_0}\theta_0\in
L^2$. The initial density is assumed to be only nonnegative and thus the initial vacuum is allowed.
In addition to the necessary regularity assumptions, we do not require any initial compatibility
conditions such as those proposed in (Y. Cho and H. Kim, \emph{Existence results for viscous polytropic
fluids with vacuum}, J. Differential Equations {\bf 228} (2006), no.~2, 377--411.), which although
are widely used in many previous works but put some inconvenient constraints on the initial data.
Due to the weaker regularities of the initial data and the absence of the initial compatibility conditions,
leading to weaker regularities of the solutions compared with those in the previous works, the uniqueness
of solutions obtained in the current paper does not follow from the arguments used in the existing
literatures. Our proof of the uniqueness of solutions is based on the following new idea of two-stages
argument: (i) showing that the difference of two solutions (or part of their components) with the
same initial data is controlled by some power function of the time variable; (ii) carrying out some
singular-in-time weighted energy differential inequalities fulfilling the structure of the
Gr\"onwall inequality. The existence is established in the Euler coordinates, while the uniqueness
is proved in the Lagrangian coordinates first and then transformed back to the Euler coordinates.

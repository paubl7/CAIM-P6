Computing the distribution of permanents of random matrices has been an outstanding open problem
for several decades. In quantum computing, "anti-concentration" of this distribution is an unproven
input for the proof of hardness of the task of boson-sampling. We study permanents of random i.i.d.
complex Gaussian matrices, and more broadly, submatrices of random unitary matrices. Using a hybrid
representation-theoretic and combinatorial approach, we prove strong lower bounds for all moments
of the permanent distribution. We provide substantial evidence that our bounds are close to being
tight and constitute accurate estimates for the moments. Let $U(d)^{k\times k}$ be the distribution
of $k\times k$ submatrices of $d\times d$ random unitary matrices, and $G^{k\times k}$ be the distribution
of $k\times k$ complex Gaussian matrices. (1) Using the Schur-Weyl duality (or the Howe duality),
we prove an expansion formula for the $2t$-th moment of $|Perm(M)|$ when $M$ is drawn from $U(d)^{k\times
k}$ or $G^{k\times k}$. (2) We prove a surprising size-moment duality: the $2t$-th moment of the
permanent of random $k\times k$ matrices is equal to the $2k$-th moment of the permanent of $t\times
t$ matrices. (3) We design an algorithm to exactly compute high moments of the permanent of small
matrices. (4) We prove lower bounds for arbitrary moments of permanents of matrices drawn from $G^{
k\times k}$ or $U(k)$, and conjecture that our lower bounds are close to saturation up to a small multiplicative
error. (5) Assuming our conjectures, we use the large deviation theory to compute the tail of the
distribution of log-permanent of Gaussian matrices for the first time. (6) We argue that it is unlikely
that the permanent distribution can be uniquely determined from the integer moments and one may
need to supplement the moment calculations with extra assumptions to prove the anti-concentration
conjecture.

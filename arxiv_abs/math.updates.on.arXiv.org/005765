Wakes of upswept afterbodies are often characterized by a counter-rotating streamwise vortex
pair. The unsteady dynamics of these vortices are examined with a spatio-temporally resolved Large-Eddy
Simulation dataset on a representative configuration consisting of a cylinder with an upswept
basal surface. Emphasis is placed on understanding the meandering motion of the vortices in the
pair, including vortex core displacement, spectral content, stability mechanisms and overall
rank-behavior. The first two energy-ranked modes obtained through Proper Orthogonal Decomposition(POD)
of the time-resolved vorticity field reveals a pair of vortex dipoles aligned relatively perpendicularly
to each other. The dynamics is successfully mapped to a matched Batchelor vortex pair whose spatial
and temporal stability analyses indicate similar dipole structures associated with an |m|=1 elliptic
mode pair. This short-wave elliptic instability dominates the meandering motion, with strain
due to axial velocity playing a key role in breakdown. The low frequency of the unstable mode (Strouhal
number StD =0.3 based on cylinder diameter) is consistent with spectral analysis of meandering
in the LES. The wake is examined for its rank behavior; the number of modes required to reproduce the
flow to given degree of accuracy diminishes rapidly outside of the immediate vicinity of the base.
Beyond two diameters downstream, only two leading POD modes are required to reconstruct the dominant
meandering motion and spatial structure in the LES data with < 15% performance loss, while ten modes
nearly completely recover the flow field. This low-rank behavior may hold promise in constructing
a reduced-order model for control purposes.

Connected and automated vehicle (CAV) technology is providing urban transportation managers
tremendous opportunities for better operation of urban mobility systems. However, there are significant
challenges in real-time implementation, as the computational time of the corresponding operations
optimization model increases exponentially with increasing vehicle numbers. Following the companion
paper (Chen et al., 2020) which proposes a novel automated traffic control scheme for isolated intersections,
this study proposes a network-level real-time traffic control framework for CAVs on grid networks.
The proposed framework integrates a rhythmic control (RC) method with an online routing algorithm
to realize collisionfree control of all CAVs on a network and achieve superior performance in average
vehicle delay, network traffic throughput, and computational scalability. Specifically, we
construct a preset network rhythm that all CAVs can follow to move on the network and avoid collisions
at all intersections. Based on the network rhythm, we then formulate online routing for the CAVs
as a mixed integer linear program, which optimizes the entry times of CAVs at all entrances of the
network and their time-space routings in real time. We provide a sufficient condition that the linear
programming relaxation of the online routing model yields an optimal integer solution. Extensive
numerical tests are conducted to show the performance of the proposed operations management framework
under various scenarios. It is illustrated that the framework is capable of achieving negligible
delays and increased network throughput. Furthermore, the computational time results are also
promising. The CPU time for solving a collision-free control optimization problem with 2,000 vehicles
is only 0.3 s on an ordinary personal computer.

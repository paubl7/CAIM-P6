Port-based teleportation (PBT) is a protocol of quantum teleportation in which a receiver does
not have to apply correction to the transmitted state. In this protocol two spatially separated
parties can teleport an unknown quantum state only by exploiting joint measurements on shared $d-$dimensional
maximally entangled states (resource state) together with a state to be teleported and one way classical
communication. In this paper we analyse degradation of the resource state after one round of PBT
and implications for the recycling protocol for deterministic PBT introduced earlier. In the recycling
protocol the main idea is to re-use the remaining resource state after one or many rounds of PBT for
further processes of teleportation. It was stated by other authors that the recycling protocol
is by arguing that the resource state does not degrade too much after each round of teleportation
process. In particular, there is a claim that the fidelity between ideal resource state and its real
version, each of them after one round of PBT, reaches asymptotically 1 when the number of shared entangled
pairs tends to infinity. Here, considering original setup for the recycling protocol, we disprove
these claims. We show the resource state is heavily distorted after even one round of PBT with fidelity
not exceeding the value $1/d$. This bound was obtained by referring only to Schwarz inequality and
general properties of measurements exploited in the protocol. As additional results we present
explicit formula for the mentioned fidelity involving group-theoretic parameters describing
irreducible representations in the Schur-Weyl duality. For the first time, we also analyse the
degradation of the resource state for the optimal PBT scheme and show its substantial distortion
for all $d\geq 2$. (...)

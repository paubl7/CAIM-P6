Rochlin proved \cite{VR} that a closed 4-dimensional connected smooth oriented manifold $X^4$
with vanishing second Stiefel-Whitney class has signature $\sigma(X)$ divisible by 16. This was
generalized by Kervaire and Milnor \cite{kervaire_milnor_spheres} to the statement that if $\xi
\in H_2(X;\mathbb{Z})$ is an integral lift of an element in $H_2(X; \mathbb{Z}/2\mathbb{Z})$
that is dual to $w_2(X)$, and if $\xi$ can be represented by an embedded sphere in $X$, then the self-intersection
number $\xi^2$ is divisible by 16. This was subsequently generalized further by Rochlin (see Theorem
\ref{matsumoto} below) and various alternative proofs of this result where given by Freedman and
Kirby \cite{freedman1978geometric}, Matsumoto \cite{matsumoto}, and Kirby \cite{kirbybook}.
We give further generalizations of this result concerning 4-manifolds with boundary. Given a smooth
compact orientable four manifold $X^4$ with integral homology sphere boundary and a connected
orientable characteristic surface with connected boundary $F^2$ properly embedded in $X$, we
prove a theorem relating the Arf invariant of $\partial F$, and the Arf invariant of $F$, and the Rochlin
invariant of $\partial X$. We then proceed to generalize this result to the case where $X$ is a topological
compact orientable 4-manifold (which brings in the Kirby-Siebenmann invariant), $\partial F$
is not connected (which brings in the condition of being proper as a link), $F$ is not orientable (which
brings in Brown invariants), and finally where $\partial X$ is an arbitrary 3-manifold (which brings
in pin structures). The final result gives a ``combinatorial'' description of the Kirby-Siebenmann
invariant of a compact orientable 4-manifold with nonempty boundary.

In the framework of accurate and efficient segregated schemes for 3D cardiac electromechanics
and 0D cardiovascular models, we propose here a novel numerical approach to address the coupled
3D-0D problem introduced in Part I of this two-part series of papers. We combine implicit-explicit
schemes to solve the different cardiac models in a multiphysics setting. We properly separate and
manage the different time and space scales related to cardiac electromechanics and blood circulation.
We employ a flexible and scalable intergrid transfer operator that enables to interpolate Finite
Element functions among different meshes and, possibly, among different Finite Element spaces.
We propose a numerical method to couple the 3D electromechanical model and the 0D circulation model
in a numerically stable manner within a fully segregated fashion. No adaptations are required through
the different phases of the heartbeat. We also propose a robust algorithm to reconstruct the stress-free
reference configuration. Due to the computational cost associated with the numerical solution
of this inverse problem, the reference configuration recovery algorithm comes along with a novel
projection technique to precisely recover the unloaded geometry from a coarser representation
of the computational domain. We show the convergence property of our numerical schemes by performing
an accuracy study through grid refinement. To prove the biophysical accuracy of our computational
model, we also address different scenarios of clinical interest in our numerical simulations by
varying preload, afterload and contractility. Indeed, we simulate physiologically relevant
behaviors and we reproduce meaningful results in the context of cardiac function.

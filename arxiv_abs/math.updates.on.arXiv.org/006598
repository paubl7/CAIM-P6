Localized patterns in singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion equations typically consist
of slow parts -- in which the associated solution follows an orbit on a slow manifold in a reduced spatial
dynamical system -- alternated by fast excursions -- in which the solution jumps from one slow manifold
to another, or back to the original slow manifold. In this paper we consider the existence and stability
of stationary and traveling slow localized patterns that do not exhibit such jumps, i.e. that are
completely embedded in a slow manifold of the singularly perturbed spatial dynamical system. These
patterns have rarely been considered in the literature, for two reasons: (i) in the classical Gray-Scott/Gierer-Meinhardt
type models that dominate the literature, the flow on the slow manifold is typically linear and thus
cannot exhibit homoclinic pulse or heteroclinic front solutions; (ii) the slow manifolds occurring
in the literature are typically `vertical' -- i.e. given by $u \equiv u_0$, where $u$ is the fast variable
-- so that the stability problem is determined by a simple (decoupled) scalar equation. The present
research concerns a general system of singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion equations and
is motivated by several explicit ecosystem models that do give rise to non-vertical normally hyperbolic
slow manifolds on which the flow may exhibit both homoclinic and heteroclinic orbits -- that correspond
to either stationary or traveling localized patterns. The associated spectral stability problems
are at leading order given by a nonlinear, but scalar, eigenvalue problem with Sturm-Liouville
characteristics and we establish that homoclinic pulse patterns are typically unstable, while
heteroclinic fronts can either be stable or unstable. However, we also show that homoclinic pulse
patterns that are asymptotically close to a heteroclinic cycle may be stable.

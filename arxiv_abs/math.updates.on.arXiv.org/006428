We show that all compact four-dimensional Hamiltonian $S^1$-spaces can be extended to a completely
integrable system on the same manifold such that all singularities are non-degenerate, except
possibly for a finite number of degenerate orbits of parabolic (also called cuspidal) type -- we
call such systems hypersemitoric. More precisely, given any compact four dimensional Hamiltonian
$S^1$-space $(M,\omega,J)$ we show that there exists a smooth $H\colon M\to\mathbb{R}$ such that
$(M,\omega,(J,H))$ is a completely integrable system of hypersemitoric type. Hypersemitoric
systems generalize semitoric systems. In addition to elliptic-elliptic, elliptic-regular,
and focus-focus singular points which can occur in semitoric systems, hypersemitoric systems
may also have hyperbolic-regular and hyperbolic-elliptic singular points (hyperbolic-hyperbolic
points cannot appear due to the presence of the global $S^1$-action) and moreover degenerate singular
points of a relatively tame type called parabolic. Admitting the existence of degenerate points
is necessary since there exist compact four-dimensional Hamiltonian $S^1$-spaces whose extensions
must include degenerate singular points of some kind as we show in the present paper. Parabolic points
are among the most common and natural degenerate points, and we show that it is sufficient to only
admit these degenerate points in order to extend all Hamiltonian $S^1$-spaces. In this sense, hypersemitoric
systems are thus the "nicest and smallest" class of systems to which all Hamiltonian $S^1$-spaces
can be extended. Moreover, we prove several foundational results about these systems, such as the
non-existence of loops of hyperbolic-regular points and properties about their fibers.

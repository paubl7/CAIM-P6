This article provides a self-contained pedagogical introduction to the relativistic kinetic
theory of a dilute gas propagating on a curved spacetime manifold (M,g) of arbitrary dimension.
Special emphasis is made on geometric aspects of the theory in order to achieve a formulation which
is manifestly covariant on the relativistic phase space. Whereas most previous work has focussed
on the tangent bundle formulation, here we work on the cotangent bundle associated with (M,g) which
is more naturally adapted to the Hamiltonian framework of the theory. In the first part of this work
we discuss the relevant geometric structures of the cotangent bundle T*M, starting with the natural
symplectic form on T*M, the one-particle Hamiltonian and the Liouville vector field, defined as
the corresponding Hamiltonian vector field. Next, we discuss the Sasaki metric on T*M and its most
important properties, including the role it plays for the physical interpretation of the one-particle
distribution function. In the second part of this work we describe the general relativistic theory
of a collisionless gas, starting with the derivation of the collisionless Boltzmann equation for
a neutral simple gas. Subsequently, the description is generalized to a charged gas consisting
of several species of particles and the general relativistic Vlasov-Maxwell equations are derived
for this system. The last part of this work is devoted to a transparent derivation of the collision
term, leading to the general relativistic Boltzmann equation on (M,g). The meaning of global and
local equilibrium and the strident restrictions for the existence of the former on a curved spacetime
are discussed. We close this article with an application of our formalism to the expansion of a homogeneous
and isotropic universe filled with a collisional simple gas and its behavior in the early and late
epochs. [abbreviated version]

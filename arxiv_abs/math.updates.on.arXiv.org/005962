We introduce methods for deriving analytic solutions from differential-algebraic systems of
equations (DAEs), as well as methods for deriving governing equations for analytic characterization
which is currently limited to very small systems as it is carried out by hand. Analytic solutions
to the system and analytic characterization through governing equations provide insights into
the behaviors of DAEs as well as the parametric regions of operation for each potential behavior.
For each system (DAEs), and choice of dependent variable, there is a corresponding governing equation
which is univariate ODE or PDE that is typically higher order than the constitutive equations of
the system. We first introduce a direct formulation for representing systems of linear DAEs. Unlike
state space formulations, our formulation follows very directly from the system of constitutive
equations without the need for introducing state variables or singular matrices. Using this formulation
for the system of constitutive equations (DAEs), we develop methods for deriving analytic expressions
for the full solution (complementary and particular) for all dependent variables of systems that
consist of constant coefficient ordinary-DAEs and special cases of partial-DAEs. We also develop
methods for deriving the governing equation for a chosen dependent variable for the constant coefficient
ordinary-DAEs and partial-DAEs as well as special cases of variable coefficient DAEs. The methods
can be automated with symbolic coding environments thereby allowing for dealing with systems of
any size while retaining analytic nature. This is relevant for interpretable modeling, analytic
characterization and estimation, and engineering design in which the objective is to tune parameter
values to achieve specific behavior. Such insights cannot directly be obtained using numerical
simulations.

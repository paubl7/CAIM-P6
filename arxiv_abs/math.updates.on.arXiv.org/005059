Let $SM_n(\mathbb{R})^g$ denote $g$-tuples of $n \times n$ real symmetric matrices and set $SM(\mathbb{R})^g
= \cup_n SM_n(\mathbb{R})^g$. A free quadrilateral is the collection of tuples $X \in SM(\mathbb{R})^2$
which have positive semidefinite evaluation on the linear equations defining a classical quadrilateral.
Such a set is closed under a rich class of convex combinations called matrix convex combination.
That is, given elements $X=(X_1, \dots, X_g) \in SM_{n_1}(\mathbb{R})^g$ and $Y=(Y_1, \dots,
Y_g) \in SM_{n_2}(\mathbb{R})^g$ of a free quadrilateral $\mathcal{Q}$, one has \[ V_1^T X V_1+V_2^T
Y V_2 \in \mathcal{Q} \] for any contractions $V_1:\mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}^{n_1}$ and $V_2:\mathbb{R}^n
\to \mathbb{R}^{n_2}$ satisfying $V_1^T V_1+V_2^T V_2=I_n$. These matrix convex combinations
are a natural analogue of convex combinations in the dimension free setting. A natural class of extreme
point for free quadrilaterals is free extreme points: elements of a free quadrilateral which cannot
be expressed as a nontrivial matrix convex combination of elements of the free quadrilateral. These
free extreme points serve as the minimal set which recovers a free quadrilateral through matrix
convex combinations. In this article we show that the set of free extreme points of a free quadrilateral
is determined by the zero set of a collection of noncommutative polynomials. More precisely, given
a free quadrilateral $\mathcal{Q}$, we construct noncommutative polynomials $p_1,p_2,p_3,p_4$
such that a tuple $X \in SM (\mathbb{R})^2$ is a free extreme point of a $\mathcal{Q}$ if and only if
$X \in \mathcal{Q}$ and $p_i(X) =0 $ for $i=1,2,3,4$ and $X$ is irreducible. In addition we establish
several basic results for projective maps of free spectrahedra and for homogeneous free spectrahedra.

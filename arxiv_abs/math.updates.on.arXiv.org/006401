We present the analytical singular value decomposition of the stoichiometry matrix for a spatially
discrete reaction-diffusion system on a one dimensional domain. The domain has two subregions
which share a single common boundary. Each of the subregions is further partitioned into a finite
number of compartments. Chemical reactions can occur within a compartment, whereas diffusion
is represented as movement between adjacent compartments. Inspired by biology, we study both 1)
the case where the reactions on each side of the boundary are different and only certain species diffuse
across the boundary as well as 2) the case with spatially homogenous reactions and diffusion. We
write the stoichiometry matrix for these two classes of systems using a Kronecker product formulation.
For the first scenario, we apply linear perturbation theory to derive an approximate singular value
decomposition in the limit as diffusion becomes much faster than reactions. For the second scenario,
we derive an exact analytical singular value decomposition for all relative diffusion and reaction
time scales. By writing the stoichiometry matrix using Kronecker products, we show that the singular
vectors and values can also be written concisely using Kronecker products. Ultimately, we find
that the singular value decomposition of the reaction-diffusion stoichiometry matrix depends
on the singular value decompositions of smaller matrices. These smaller matrices represent modified
versions of the reaction-only stoichiometry matrices and the analytically known diffusion-only
stoichiometry matrix. Our results provide a mathematical framework that can be used to study complex
biochemical systems with metabolic compartments. MATLAB code for calculating the SVD equations

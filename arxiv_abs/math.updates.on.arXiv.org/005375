Stochastic errors on quantum systems occur randomly but coherent errors are more damaging since
they can accumulate in a particular direction. While active error correction can address coherent
noise, a passive approach is to design decoherence free subspaces (DFS) that remain unperturbed
by this noise. This paper considers a form of coherent $Z$-errors and constructs stabilizer codes
that form DFS for such noise ("Z-DFS"). We develop conditions for transversal $\exp(\imath \theta
Z)$ to preserve a stabilizer code subspace for all $\theta$. If the code is error-detecting, then
this implies a trivial action on the logical qubits. These conditions require the existence of a
large number of weight-$2$ $Z$-stabilizers, and together, these generate a direct product of single-parity-check
codes. By adjusting the size of these components, we construct a linear rate family of CSS Z-DFS codes.
Invariance under transversal $\exp(\frac{\imath \pi}{2^l} Z)$ translates to a trigonometric
equation satisfied by $\tan\frac{2\pi}{2^l}$, and there is an equation for each non-zero $X$-component
of stabilizers. The $Z$-stabilizers on the support of a stabilizer's $X$-component form a code
$C$, and the trigonometric constraint connects signs of the $Z$-stabilizers to divisibility of
weights in $C^{\perp}$. This connection to divisibility might be of independent interest to classical
coding theorists. Next, to induce a non-trivial logical operation, we impose that transversal
$\exp(\frac{\imath \pi}{2^l} Z)$ preserve the code space only up to a finite level $l$ in the Clifford
hierarchy. The aforesaid code $C$ contains a self-dual code and the classical Gleason's theorem
constrains its weight enumerator. Surprisingly, the finite $l$ constraint makes the trigonometric
equation generalize Gleason's theorem. Several examples, e.g. the $[[4L^2,1,2L]]$ Shor codes,
are described to illuminate our general results.

The Boltzmann distribution of an ideal gas is determined by the Hamiltonian function generating
single particle dynamics. Systems with higher complexity often exhibit topological constraints,
which are independent of the Hamiltonian and may affect the shape of the distribution function as
well. Here, we study a further source of heterogeneity, the curvature of spacetime arising from
the general theory of relativity. The present construction relies on three assumptions: first,
the statistical ensemble is made of particles obeying geodesic equations, which define the phase
space of the system. Next, the metric coefficients are time-symmetric, implying that, if thermodynamic
equilibrium is achieved, all physical observables are independent of coordinate time. Finally,
ergodicity is enforced with respect to proper time, so that ambiguity in the choice of a time variable
for the statistical ensemble is removed. Under these hypothesis, we derive the distribution function
of thermodynamic equilibrium, and verify that it reduces to the Boltzmann distribution in the classical
limit. We further show that spacetime curvature affects physical observables, even far from the
source of the metric. Two examples are analyzed: an ideal gas in Schwarzschild spacetime and a charged
gas in Kerr-Newman spacetime. In the Schwarzschild case, conservation of macroscopic constraints,
such as angular momentum, combined with relativistic distortion of the distribution function
can produce configurations with decreasing density and growing azimuthal rotation velocity far
from the event horizon of the central mass. In the Kerr-Newman case, it is found that kinetic energy
associated with azimuthal rotations is an increasing function of the radial coordinate, and it
eventually approaches a constant value corresponding to classical equipartition, even though
spatial particle density decreases.

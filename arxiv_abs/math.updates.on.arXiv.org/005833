Computation of gas dispersal in urban places or hilly grounds requires a large amount of computer
time when addressed with conventional multidimensional models. Those are usually based on two-phase
flow or Navier-Stokes equations. Different classes of simplified models exist. Among them, two-layer
shallow water models are interesting to address large-scale dispersion. Indeed, compared to conventional
multidimensional approaches, 2D simulations are carried out to mimic 3D effects. The computational
gain in CPU time is consequently expected to be tremendous. However, such models involve at least
three fundamental difficulties. The first one is related to the lack of hyperbolicity of most existing
formulations, yielding serious consequences regarding wave propagation. The second is related
to the non-conservative terms in the momentum equations. Those terms account for interactions
between fluid layers. Recently, these two difficulties have been addressed in Chiapolino and Saurel
(2018) and an unconditional hyperbolic model has been proposed along with a Harten-Lax-van Leer
(HLL) type Riemann solver dealing with the non-conservative terms. In the same reference, numerical
experiments showed robustness and accuracy of the formulation. In the present paper, a third difficulty
is addressed. It consists of the determination of appropriate drag effect formulation. Such effects
also account for interactions between fluid layers and become of particular importance when dealing
with heavy-gas dispersion. With this aim, the model is compared to laboratory experiments in the
context of heavy gas dispersal in quiescent air. It is shown that the model accurately reproduces
experimental results thanks to an appropriate drag force correlation. This function expresses
drag effects between the heavy and light gas layers. It is determined thanks to various experimental
configurations of dam-break test problems.

Emotions are a central key for understanding human beings and of fundamental importance regarding
their impact in human and animal behaviors. They have been for a long time a subject of study for various
scholars including in particular philosophers and mystics. In modern science, the emotional phenomenon
has attracted for a few decades an increasing number of studies, notably in the fields of Psychology,
Psychiatry, Neuroscience and Biochemistry. However, since our perception of emotions is not,
so far, directly detectable nor recordable by our measure instruments, Physics and Mathematics
have not been so far used academically to provide a precise description of the phenomenon of feeling
an emotion. Relying upon the works of O. Elahi and on the hypothesis that the human soul and its psyche
may manifest in ourselves (in both conscious and unconscious manner) in an analog way as electromagnetic
waves, we propose here a few mathematical descriptions consistent with the human personal experience,
of the feeling and cognition of emotions. As far as we know, such a mathematical description has never
been provided before. It allows a quantitative (intensity) and qualitative (nature of feelings/frequency)
of the emotional phenomenon which provides a novel scientific approach of the nature of the mind,
complementary to the on going research of physiological manifestation of emotions. We anticipate
such an approach and the associated mathematical modeling to become an important tool to describe
emotions and their subsequent behavior. In complement of the modeling of oscillations and brain
dynamics, it provides a fruitful direction of research with potentially broad and deep impacts
in both applied mathematics, physics, cognitive and behavioral sciences.

It is shown that there is a close relationship between ideal extensions of rings and trusses, that
is, sets with a semigroup operation distributing over a ternary abelian heap operation. Specifically,
a truss can be associated to every element of an extension ring that projects down to an idempotent
in the extending ring; every weak equivalence of extensions yields an isomorphism of corresponding
trusses. Furthermore, equivalence classes of ideal extensions of rings by integers are in one-to-one
correspondence with associated trusses up to isomorphism given by a translation. Conversely,
to any truss $T$ and an element of this truss one can associate a ring and its extension by integers
in which $T$ is embedded as a truss. Consequently any truss can be understood as arising from an ideal
extension by integers. The key role is played by interpretation of ideal extensions by integers
as extensions defined by double homothetisms of Redei [L.\ Redei, Die Verallgemeinerung der Schreierschen
Erweiterungstheorie, {\em Acta Sci.\ Math.\ Szeged}, {\bf 14} (1952), 252--273] or by self-permutable
bimultiplications of Mac Lane [S.\ Mac Lane, Extensions and obstructions for rings, {\em Illinois
J.\ Math.} {\bf 2} (1958), 316--345], that is, as {\em integral homothetic extensions}. It is shown
that integral homothetic extensions of trusses are universal as extensions of trusses to rings
but still enjoy a particular smallness property: they do not contain any subrings to which the truss
inclusion map corestricts. Minimal extensions of trusses into rings are defined. The correspondence
between homothetic ring extensions and trusses is used to classify fully up to isomorphism trusses
arising from rings with zero multiplication and rings with trivial annihilators.

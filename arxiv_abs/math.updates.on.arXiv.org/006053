This paper is the first of a pair that aims to classify a large number of the type $II$ quantum subgroups
of the categories $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_{r+1},k)$. In this work we classify the braided
auto-equivalences of the categories of local modules for all known type $I$ quantum subgroups of
$\mathcal{C}( \mathfrak{sl}_{r+1},k )$, barring a single unresolved case for an orbifold of $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_{4},8)$.
We find that the symmetries are all non-exceptional except for four possible cases (up to level-rank
duality). These exceptional cases are the orbifolds $\mathcal{C}( \mathfrak{sl}_{2},16)_{\operatorname{Rep}(\mathbb{Z}_2)}$,
$\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_{3},9)_{\operatorname{Rep}( \mathbb{Z}_3)}$, $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_{4},8)_{\operatorname{Rep}(\mathbb{Z}_4)}$,
and $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_{5},5)_{\operatorname{Rep}(\mathbb{Z}_5)}$. We develop
several technical tools in this work. We give a skein theoretic description of the orbifold quantum
subgroups of $\mathcal{C}( \mathfrak{sl}_{r+1},k)$. Our methods here are general, and the techniques
developed will generalise to give skein theory for any orbifold of a braided tensor category. We
also uncover an unexpected connection between quadratic categories and exceptional braided auto-equivalences
of the orbifolds. We use this connection to construct two of the four exceptionals, and to reduce
the $\mathcal{C}( \mathfrak{sl}_{4},8)_{ \operatorname{Rep}(\mathbb{Z}_4)}$ case to a concrete
finite computation. In the sequel to this paper we will use the classified braided auto-equivalences
to construct the corresponding type $II$ quantum subgroups of the categories $\mathcal{C}( \mathfrak{sl}_{r+1},k)$.
When paired with Gannon's type $I$ classification for $r\leq 6$, this will complete the type $II$
classification for these same ranks, excluding the one exception at $\mathcal{C}(\mathfrak{sl}_{4},8)$.

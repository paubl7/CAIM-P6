The paper is devoted to a reverse-mathematical study of some well-known consequences of Ramsey's
theorem for pairs, focused on the chain-antichain principle $\mathsf{CAC}$, the ascending-descending
sequence principle $\mathsf{ADS}$, and the Cohesive Ramsey Theorem for pairs $\mathsf{CRT}^2_2$.
We study these principles over the base theory $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$, which is weaker than the usual
base theory $\mathsf{RCA}_0$ considered in reverse mathematics in that it allows only $\Delta^0_1$-induction
as opposed to $\Sigma^0_1$-induction. In $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$, it may happen that an unbounded
subset of $\mathbb{N}$ is not in bijective correspondence with $\mathbb{N}$. Accordingly, Ramsey-theoretic
principles split into at least two variants, "normal" and "long", depending on the sense in which
the set witnessing the principle is required to be infinite. We prove that the normal versions of
our principles, like that of Ramsey's theorem for pairs and two colours, are equivalent to their
relativizations to proper $\Sigma^0_1$-definable cuts. Because of this, they are all $\Pi^0_3$-
but not $\Pi^1_1$-conservative over $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$, and, in any model of $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0
+ \neg \mathsf{RCA}_0$, if they are true then they are computably true relative to some set. The long
versions exhibit one of two behaviours: they either imply $\mathsf{RCA}_0$ over $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$
or are $\Pi^0_3$-conservative over $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$. The conservation results are obtained
using a variant of the so-called grouping principle. We also show that the cohesion principle $\mathsf{COH}$,
a strengthening of $\mathsf{CRT}^2_2$, is never computably true in a model of $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$
and, as a consequence, does not follow from $\mathsf{RT}^2_2$ over $\mathsf{RCA}^*_0$.

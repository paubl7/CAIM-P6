We investigate the existence and local uniqueness of normalized $k$-peak solutions for the fractional
Schr\"odinger equations with attractive interactions with a class of degenerated trapping potential
with non-isolated critical points. Precisely, applying the finite dimensional reduction method,
we first obtain the existence of $k$-peak concentrated solutions and especially describe the relationship
between the chemical potential $\mu$ and the attractive interaction $a$. Second, after precise
analysis of the concentrated points and the Lagrange multiplier, we prove the local uniqueness
of the $k$-peak solutions with prescribed $L^2$-norm, by use of the local Pohozaev identities,
the blow-up analysis and the maximum principle associated to the nonlocal operator $(-\Delta)^s$.
To our best knowledge, there is few results on the excited normalized solutions of the fractional
Schr\"odinger equations before this present work. The main difficulty lies in the non-local property
of the operator $(-\Delta)^s$. First, it makes the standard comparison argument in the ODE theory
invalid to use in our analysis. Second, because of the algebraic decay involving the approximate
solutions, the estimates, on the Lagrange multiplier for example, would become more subtle. Moreover,when
studying the corresponding harmonic extension problem, several local Pohozaev identities are
constructed and we have to estimate several kinds of integrals that never appear in the classic local
Schr\"odinger problems. In addition, throughout our discussion, we need to distinct the different
cases of $p$, which are called respectively that the mass-subcritical, the mass-critical, and
the mass-supercritical case, due to the mass-constraint condition. Another difficulty comes
from the influence of the different degenerate rates along different directions at the critical
points of the potential.

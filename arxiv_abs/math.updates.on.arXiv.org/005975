Computing spectra is a central problem in computational mathematics with an abundance of applications
throughout the sciences. However, in many applications gaining an approximation of the spectrum
is not enough. Often it is vital to determine geometric features of spectra such as Lebesgue measure,
capacity or fractal dimensions, different types of spectral radii and numerical ranges, or to detect
essential spectral gaps and the corresponding failure of the finite section method. Despite new
results on computing spectra and the substantial interest in these geometric problems, there remain
no general methods able to compute such geometric features of spectra of infinite-dimensional
operators. We provide the first algorithms for the computation of many of these longstanding problems
(including the above). As demonstrated with computational examples, the new algorithms yield
a library of new methods. Recent progress in computational spectral problems in infinite dimensions
has led to the Solvability Complexity Index (SCI) hierarchy, which classifies the difficulty of
computational problems. These results reveal that infinite-dimensional spectral problems yield
an intricate infinite classification theory determining which spectral problems can be solved
and with which type of algorithm. This is very much related to S. Smale's comprehensive program on
the foundations of computational mathematics initiated in the 1980s. We classify the computation
of geometric features of spectra in the SCI hierarchy, allowing us to precisely determine the boundaries
of what computers can achieve and prove that our algorithms are optimal. We also provide a new universal
technique for establishing lower bounds in the SCI hierarchy, which both greatly simplifies previous
SCI arguments and allows new, formerly unattainable, classifications.

$\mathtt{d}$-dimensional hyperspherical quantum dot with either Dirichlet or Neumann boundary
conditions (BCs) allows analytic solution of the Schr\"{o}dinger equation in position space and
the Fourier transform of the corresponding wave function leads to the analytic form of its momentum
counterpart too. This paves the way to an efficient computation in either space of Shannon, R\'{e}nyi
and Tsallis entropies, Onicescu energies and Fisher informations; for example, for the latter
measure, some particular orbitals exhibit simple expressions in either space at any BC type. A comparative
study of the influence of the edge requirement on the quantum information measures proves that the
lower threshold of the semi-infinite range of the dimensionless R\'{e}nyi/Tsallis coefficient
where one-parameter momentum entropies exist is equal to $\mathtt{d}/(\mathtt{d}+3)$ for the
Dirichlet hyperball and $\mathtt{d}/(\mathtt{d}+1)$ for the Neumann one what means that at the
unrestricted growth of the dimensionality both measures have their Shannon fellow as the lower
verge. Simultaneously, this imposes the restriction on the upper value of the interval $[1/2,\alpha_R)$
inside which the R\'{e}nyi uncertainty relation for the sum of the position $R_\rho(\alpha)$ and
wave vector $R_\gamma\left(\frac{\alpha}{2\alpha-1}\right)$ components is defined: $\alpha_R$
is equal to $\mathtt{d}/(\mathtt{d}-3)$ for the Dirichlet geometry and to $\mathtt{d}/(\mathtt{d}-1)$
for the Neumann BC. Some other properties are discussed from mathematical and physical points of
view. Parallels are drawn to the corresponding properties of the hydrogen atom and similarities
and differences are explained based on the analysis of the associated wave functions.

Computational methods and mathematical models have invaded arguably every scientific discipline
forming its own field of research called computational science. Mathematical models are the theoretical
foundation of computational science. Since Newton's time, differential equations in mathematical
models have been widely and successfully used to describe the macroscopic or global behaviour of
systems. With spatially inhomogeneous, time-varying, local element-specific, and often non-linear
interactions, the dynamics of complex systems is in contrast more efficiently described by local
rules and thus in an algorithmic and local or microscopic manner. The theory of mathematical modelling
taking into account these characteristics of complex systems has to be established still. We recently
presented a so-called allagmatic method including a system metamodel to provide a framework for
describing, modelling, simulating, and interpreting complex systems. Implementations of cellular
automata and artificial neural networks were described and created with that method. Guidance
from philosophy were helpful in these first studies focusing on programming and feasibility. A
rigorous mathematical formalism, however, is still missing. This would not only more precisely
describe and define the system metamodel, it would also further generalise it and with that extend
its reach to formal treatment in applied mathematics and theoretical aspects of computational
science as well as extend its applicability to other mathematical and computational models such
as agent-based models. Here, a mathematical definition of the system metamodel is provided. Based
on the presented formalism, model creation and equivalence of cellular automata and artificial
neural networks are proved. It thus provides a formal approach for studying the creation of mathematical
models as well as their structural and operational comparison.

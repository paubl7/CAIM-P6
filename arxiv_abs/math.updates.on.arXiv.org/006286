Recent research has highlighted the non-uniqueness problem of energy-momentum tensors in linearized
gravity; many different tensors are published in the literature, yet for particular calculations
a unique expression is required. It has been shown that (A) none of these spin-2 energy-momentum
tensors are gauge invariant and (B) the Noether and Hilbert energy-momentum tensors are not, in
general, equivalent; therefore uniqueness criteria is difficult to specify. Conventional wisdom
states that the various published energy-momentum tensors for linearized gravity can be derived
from the canonical Noether energy-momentum tensor of spin-2 Fierz-Pauli theory by adding ad-hoc
'improvement' terms (the divergence of a superpotential and terms proportional to the equations
of motion), that these superpotentials are in some way unique or physically significant, and that
this implies some meaningful connection to the Noether procedure. To explore this question of uniqueness,
we consider the most general possible energy-momentum tensor for linearized gravity with free
coefficients using the Fock method. We express this most general energy-momentum tensor as the
canonical Noether tensor, supplemented by the divergence of a general superpotential plus all
possible terms proportional to the equations of motion. We then derive systems of equations which
we solve in order to prove several key results for spin-2 Fierz-Pauli theory, most notably that there
are infinitely many conserved energy-momentum tensors derivable from the 'improvement' method,
and there are infinitely many conserved symmetric energy-momentum tensors that follow from specifying
the Belinfante superpotential alone. $\dots$ since there are infinitely many energy-momentum
tensors of this form, no meaningful or unique connection to Noether's first theorem can be claimed
by application of the canonical Noether 'improvement' method.

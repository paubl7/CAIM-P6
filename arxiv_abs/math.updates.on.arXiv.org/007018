We say that a PDE in a Riemannian manifold $M$ is geometric if,$\ $whenever $u$ is a solution of the
PDE on a domain $\Omega$ of $M$, the composition $u_{\phi}:=u\circ\phi$ is also solution on $\phi^{-1}\left(
\Omega\right) $, for any isometry $\phi$ of $M.$ We prove that if $u\in C^{1}\left( \mathbb{H}^{n}\right)
$ is a solution of a geometric PDE satisfying the comparison principle, where $\mathbb{H}^{n}$
is the hyperbolic space of constant sectional curvature $-1,$ $n\geq2,$ and if \[ \limsup_{R\rightarrow\infty}\left(
e^{R}\sup_{S_{R}}\left\Vert \nabla u\right\Vert \right) =0, \] where $S_{R}$ is a geodesic sphere
of $\mathbb{H}^{n}$ centered at fixed point $o\in\mathbb{H}^{n}$ with radius $R,$ then $u$ is
constant. Moreover, given $C>0,$ there is a bounded non-constant harmonic function $v\in C^{\infty
}\left( \mathbb{H}^{n}\right) $ such that \[ \lim_{R\rightarrow\infty}\left( e^{R}\sup_{S_{R}}\left\Vert
\nabla v\right\Vert \right) =C. \] The first part of the above result is a consequence of a more general
theorem proved in the paper which asserts that if $G$ is a non compact Lie group with a left invariant
metric, $u\in C^{1}\left( G\right) $ a solution of a left invariant PDE (that is, if $v$ is a solution
of the PDE on a domain $\Omega$ of $G$, the composition $v_{g}:=v\circ L_{g}$ of $v$ with a left translation
$L_{g}:G\rightarrow G,$ $L_{g}\left( h\right) =gh,$ is also solution on $L_{g}^{-1}\left( \Omega\right)
$ for any $g\in G),$ the PDE satisfies the comparison principle and% \[ \limsup_{R\rightarrow\infty}\left(
\sup_{g\in B_{R}}\left\Vert \operatorname*{Ad}\nolimits_{g}\right\Vert \sup_{S_{R}}\left\Vert
\nabla u\right\Vert \right) =0, \] where $\operatorname*{Ad}\nolimits_{g}:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}$
is the adjoint map of $G$ and $\mathfrak{g}$ the Lie algebra of $G,$ then $u$ is constant.

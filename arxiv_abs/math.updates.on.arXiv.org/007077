We develop a general approach for investigating geometric properties of Gaussian multiplicative
chaos (GMC) in an {\textit infinite dimensional} set up. The base space is chosen to be the space of
continuous functions endowed with Wiener measure, and the random field is a space-time Gaussian
noise integrated against Brownian paths. In this set up, we show that in any dimension $d\geq 1$ and
for any inverse temperature $\gamma>0$, the volume of a GMC ball, uniformly around all paths, decays
exponentially with an explicit decay rate. For $d\geq 3$ and high temperature, the decay rate is
just the principal eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian of the ball, which reflects a similar behavior
of the {\textit free } Brownian path. Incidentally, this is also the regime when the underlying Gaussian
field attains very high values under the GMC -- that is, all paths are {\textit GMC thick} in this regime.
For any $d\geq 1$, and small temperatures, the rate is given by an additional energy functional minimized
over (probability measures on) a translation-invariant compactification constructed in [MV14].
Quantifying exponential decay rates of GMC balls are natural infinite dimensional extensions
of similar behavior captured by mult-ifractal spectrum and {\textit scaling exponents} of $2d$
Liouville quantum gravity, which has been studied intensively over the last few years. To complete
the picture it is also shown that, while the volume of GMC balls decays exponentially for {\textit
any temperature}, for small enough temperature, the normalized overlap of two independent paths,
sampled according to the product GMC probability, tends to follow one of only a finite number of independent
paths for most of its allowed time horizon, allowing the GMC probability to accumulate most of its
mass along such trajectories.

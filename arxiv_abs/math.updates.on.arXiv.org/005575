We propose an integrated electromechanical model of the human heart, with focus on the left ventricle,
wherein biophysically detailed models describe the different physical phenomena concurring
to the cardiac function. We model the subcellular generation of active force by means of an Artificial
Neural Network, which is trained by a suitable Machine Learning algorithm from a collection of pre-computed
numerical simulations of a biophysically detailed, yet computational demanding, high-fidelity
model. To provide physiologically meaningful results, we couple the 3D electromechanical model
with a closed-loop 0D (lumped parameters) model describing the blood circulation in the whole cardiovascular
network. We prove that the 3D-0D coupling of the two models is compliant with the principle of energy
conservation, which is achieved in virtue of energy-consistent boundary conditions that account
for the interaction among cardiac chambers within the computational domain, pericardium and surrounding
tissue. We thus derive an overall balance of mechanical energy for the 3D-0D model. This provides
a quantitative insight into the energy utilization, dissipation and transfer among the different
compartments of the cardiovascular network and during different stages of the heartbeat. In virtue
of this new model and the energy balance, we propose a new validation tool of heart energy usage against
relationships used in the daily clinical practice. Finally, we provide a mathematical formulation
of an inverse problem aimed at recovering the reference configuration of one or multiple cardiac
chambers, starting from the stressed configuration acquired from medical imaging. This is fundamental
to correctly initialize electromechanical simulations. Numerical methods and simulations of
the 3D-0D model will be detailed in Part II.

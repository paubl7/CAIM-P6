We observe $n$ pairs $X_{1}=(W_{1},Y_{1}),\ldots,X_{n}=(W_{n},Y_{n})$ of independent random
variables and assume, although this might not be true, that for each $i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}$, the
conditional distribution of $Y_{i}$ given $W_{i}$ belongs to a given exponential family with real
parameter $\theta_{i}^{\star}=\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\star}(W_{i})$ the value of which is
a function $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\star}$ of the covariate $W_{i}$. Given a model $\boldsymbol{\overline\Theta}$
for $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\star}$, we propose an estimator $\boldsymbol{\widehat \theta}$
with values in $\boldsymbol{\overline\Theta}$ the construction of which is independent of the
distribution of the $W_{i}$ and that possesses the properties of being robust to contamination,
outliers and model misspecification. We establish non-asymptotic exponential inequalities
for the upper deviations of a Hellinger-type distance between the true distribution of the data
and the estimated one based on $\boldsymbol{\widehat \theta}$. Under a suitable parametrization
of the exponential family, we deduce a uniform risk bound for $\boldsymbol{\widehat \theta}$ over
the class of H\"olderian functions and we prove the optimality of this bound up to a logarithmic factor.
Finally, we provide an algorithm for calculating $\boldsymbol{\widehat \theta}$ when $\boldsymbol{\theta}^{\star}$
is assumed to belong to functional classes of low or medium dimensions (in a suitable sense) and,
on a simulation study, we compare the performance of $\boldsymbol{\widehat \theta}$ to that of
the MLE and median-based estimators. The proof of our main result relies on an upper bound, with explicit
numerical constants, on the expectation of the supremum of an empirical process over a VC-subgraph
class. This bound can be of independent interest.

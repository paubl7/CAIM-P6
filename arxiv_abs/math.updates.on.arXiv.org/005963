Elliptic curves arise in many important areas of modern number theory. One way to study them is take
local data, the number of solutions modulo $p$, and create an $L$-function. The behavior of this
global object is related to two of the seven Clay Millennial Problems: the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer
Conjecture and the Generalized Riemann Hypothesis. We study one-parameter families over $\mathbb{Q}(T)$,
which are of the form $y^2=x^3+A(T)x+B(T)$, with non-constant $j$-invariant. We define the r-th
moment of an elliptic curve to be $A_{r,E}(p) := \frac1{p} \sum_{t \bmod p} a_t(p)^r$, where $a_t(p)$
is $p$ minus the number of solutions to $y^2 = x^3 + A(t)x + B(t) \bmod p$. Rosen and Silverman showed
biases in the first moment equal the rank of the Mordell-Weil group of rational solutions. Michel
proved that $pA_{2,E}(p)=p^2+O(p^{3/2})$. Based on several special families where computations
can be done in closed form, Miller in his thesis conjectured that the largest lower-order term in
the second moment that does not average to $0$ is on average negative. He further showed that such
a negative bias has implications in the distribution of zeros of the elliptic curve $L$-function
near the central point. To date, evidence for this conjecture is limited to special families. In
addition to studying some additional families where the calculations can be done in closed form,
we also systematically investigate families of various rank. These are the first general tests
of the conjecture; while we cannot in general obtain closed form solutions, we discuss computations
which support or contradict the conjecture. We then generalize to higher moments, and see evidence
that the bias continues in the even moments.

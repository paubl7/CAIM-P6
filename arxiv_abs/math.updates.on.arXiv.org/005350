Given a times series ${\bf Y}$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, with a piece-wise contant mean and independent
components, the twin problems of change-point detection and change-point localization respectively
amount to detecting the existence of times where the mean varies and estimating the positions of
those change-points. In this work, we tightly characterize optimal rates for both problems and
uncover the phase transition phenomenon from a global testing problem to a local estimation problem.
Introducing a suitable definition of the energy of a change-point, we first establish in the single
change-point setting that the optimal detection threshold is $\sqrt{2\log\log(n)}$. When the
energy is just above the detection threshold, then the problem of localizing the change-point becomes
purely parametric: it only depends on the difference in means and not on the position of the change-point
anymore. Interestingly, for most change-point positions, it is possible to detect and localize
them at a much smaller energy level. In the multiple change-point setting, we establish the energy
detection threshold and show similarly that the optimal localization error of a specific change-point
becomes purely parametric. Along the way, tight optimal rates for Hausdorff and $l_1$ estimation
losses of the vector of all change-points positions are also established. Two procedures achieving
these optimal rates are introduced. The first one is a least-squares estimator with a new multiscale
penalty that favours well spread change-points. The second one is a two-step multiscale post-processing
procedure whose computational complexity can be as low as $O(n\log(n))$. Notably, these two procedures
accommodate with the presence of possibly many low-energy and therefore undetectable change-points
and are still able to detect and localize high-energy change-points even with the presence of those
nuisance parameters.

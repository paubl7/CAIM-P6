We consider the problem of identifying intermediate variables (or mediators) that regulate the
effect of a treatment on a response variable. While there has been significant research on this classical
topic, little work has been done when the set of potential mediators is high-dimensional (HD). A
further complication arises when these mediators are interrelated (with unknown dependencies).
In particular, we assume that the causal structure of the treatment, the confounders, the potential
mediators and the response is a (possibly unknown) directed acyclic graph (DAG). HD DAG models have
previously been used for the estimation of causal effects from observational data. In particular,
methods called IDA and joint-IDA have been developed for estimating the effects of single and multiple
simultaneous interventions, respectively. In this paper, we propose an IDA-type method called
MIDA for estimating so-called individual mediation effects from HD observational data. Although
IDA and joint-IDA estimators have been shown to be consistent in certain sparse HD settings, their
asymptotic properties such as convergence in distribution and inferential tools in such settings
have remained unknown. In this paper, we prove HD consistency of MIDA for linear structural equation
models with sub-Gaussian errors. More importantly, we derive distributional convergence results
for MIDA in similar HD settings, which are applicable to IDA and joint-IDA estimators as well. To
our knowledge, these are the first such distributional convergence results facilitating inference
for IDA-type estimators. These are built on our novel theoretical results regarding uniform bounds
for linear regression estimators over varying subsets of HD covariates which may be of independent
interest. Finally, we empirically validate our asymptotic theory for MIDA and demonstrate its
usefulness via simulations and a real data application.

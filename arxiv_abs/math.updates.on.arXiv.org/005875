In this paper we explore the extent to which the algebraic structure of a monoid $M$ determines the
topologies on $M$ that are compatible with its multiplication. Specifically we study the notions
of automatic continuity; minimal Hausdorff or Polish semigroup topologies; and we formulate a
notion of the Zariski topology for monoids. If $M$ is a topological monoid such that every homomorphism
from $M$ to a second countable topological monoid $N$ is continuous, then we say that $M$ has \emph{automatic
continuity}. We show that many well-known monoids have automatic continuity with respect to a natural
semigroup topology, namely: the full transformation monoid $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$; the full
binary relation monoid $B_{\mathbb{N}}$; the partial transformation monoid $P_{\mathbb{N}}$;
the symmetric inverse monoid $I_{\mathbb{N}}$; the monoid Inj$(\mathbb{N})$ consisting of the
injective functions on $\mathbb{N}$; and the monoid $C(2^{\mathbb{N}})$ of continuous functions
on the Cantor set. We show that the pointwise topology on $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$, and its analogue
on $P_{\mathbb{N}}$, are the unique Polish semigroup topologies on these monoids. The compact-open
topology is the unique Polish semigroup topology on $C(2^\mathbb{N})$ and $C([0, 1]^\mathbb{N})$.
There are at least 3 Polish semigroup topologies on $I_{\mathbb{N}}$, but a unique Polish inverse
semigroup topology. There are no Polish semigroup topologies $B_{\mathbb{N}}$ nor on the partitions
monoids. At the other extreme, Inj$(\mathbb{N})$ and the monoid Surj$(\mathbb{N})$ of all surjective
functions on $\mathbb{N}$ each have infinitely many distinct Polish semigroup topologies. We
prove that the Zariski topologies on $\mathbb{N}^\mathbb{N}$, $P_{\mathbb{N}}$, and Inj$(\mathbb{N})$
coincide with the pointwise topology; and we characterise the Zariski topology on $B_{\mathbb{N}}$.

We consider a bilevel attacker-defender problem to find the worst-case attack on the relays that
control the transmission grid. The attacker maximizes load shed by infiltrating a number of relays
and rendering the components connected to them inoperable. The defender responds by minimizing
the load shed, re-dispatching using a DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problem on the remaining network.
Though worst-case interdiction problems on the transmission grid are well-studied, there remains
a need for exact and scalable methods. Methods based on using duality on the inner problem rely on
the bounds of the dual variables of the defender problem in order to reformulate the bilevel problem
as a mixed integer linear problem. Valid dual bounds tend to be large, resulting in weak linear programming
relaxations and making the problem difficult to solve at scale. Often smaller heuristic bounds
are used, resulting in a lower bound. In this work we also consider a lower bound, where instead of
bounding the dual variables, we drop the constraints corresponding to Ohm's law, relaxing DCOPF
to capacitated network flow. We present theoretical results showing that, for uncongested networks,
approximating DCOPF with network flow yields the same set of injections, which suggests that this
restriction likely gives a high-quality lower bound in the uncongested case. Furthermore, we show
that in the network flow relaxation of the defender problem, the duals are bounded by 1, so we can solve
our restriction exactly. Last, we see empirically that this formulation scales well computationally.
Through experiments on 16 networks with up to 6468 buses, we find that this bound is almost always
as tight as we can get from guessing the dual bounds, even for congested networks. In addition, calculating
the bound is approximately 150 times faster than achieving the same bound with the reformulation
guessing the dual bounds.

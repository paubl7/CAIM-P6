Countable Markov shifts, denoted by $\Sigma_A$ for a 0-1 infinite matrix $A$, are central objects
in symbolic dynamics and ergodic theory. R. Exel and M. Laca introduced the corresponding operator
algebras, a generalization of the Cuntz-Krieger algebras for infinite countable alphabet, and
the set $X_A$, a kind of Generalized Markov Shift (GMS) that coincides with $\Sigma_A$ in the locally
compact case. The set $\Sigma_A$ is dense in $X_A$, and its complement, a set of finite allowed words,
is dense in $X_A$ when non-empty. We develop the thermodynamic formalism for $X_A$, introducing
the notion of conformal measure in it, and exploring its connections with the usual formalism for
$\Sigma_A$. New phenomena appear, as different types of phase transitions and new conformal measures
undetected by the classical thermodynamic formalism for $A$ not row-finite. Given a potential
$F$ and inverse of temperature $\beta$, we study the existence of conformal measures $\mu_{\beta}$
associated to $\beta F$. We present examples where there exists a critical $\beta_c$ s. t. we have
existence of conformal probabilities satisfying $\mu_{\beta}(\Sigma_A)=0$ for every $\beta
> \beta_c$ and, on the weak$^*$ topology, the set of conformal probabilities for $\beta >\beta_c$
collapses to the standard conformal probability $\mu_{\beta_c}$, $\mu_{\beta_c}(\Sigma_A)=1$,
for the limit $\beta\to\beta_c$. We study in detail the generalized renewal shift and modifications
of it. We highlight the bijection between infinite emitters of the alphabet and extremal conformal
probabilities for this class of renewal type shifts. We prove the existence and uniqueness of the
eigenmeasure probability of the Ruelle's transformation at low enough temperature for a particular
potential on the generalized renewal shift; such measures are not detected on the standard renewal
shift since for low temperatures, $\beta F$ is transient.

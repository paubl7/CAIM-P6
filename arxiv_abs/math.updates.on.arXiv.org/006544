The numerical solution of spectral fractional diffusion problems in the form ${\mathcal A}^\alpha
u = f$ is studied, where $\mathcal A$ is a selfadjoint elliptic operator in a bounded domain $\Omega\subset
{\mathbb R}^d$, and $\alpha \in (0,1]$. The finite difference approximation of the problem leads
to the system ${\mathbb A}^\alpha {\mathbf u} = {\mathbf f}$, where ${\mathbb A}$ is a sparse, symmetric
and positive definite (SPD) matrix, and ${\mathbb A}^\alpha$ is defined by its spectral decomposition.
In the case of finite element approximation, ${\mathbb A}$ is SPD with respect to the dot product
associated with the mass matrix. The BURA method is introduced by the best uniform rational approximation
of degree $k$ of $t^{\alpha}$ in $[0,1]$, denoted by $r_{\alpha,k}$. Then the approximation ${\bf
u}_k\approx {\bf u}$ has the form ${\bf u}_k = c_0 {\mathbf f} +\sum_{i=1}^k c_i({\mathbb A} - {\widetilde{d}}_i
{\mathbb I})^{-1}{\mathbf f}$, ${\widetilde{d}}_i<0$, thus requiring the solving of $k$ auxiliary
linear systems with sparse SPD matrices. The BURA method has almost optimal computational complexity,
assuming that an optimal PCG iterative solution method is applied to the involved auxiliary linear
systems. The presented analysis shows that the absolute values of first %${\widetilde{d}}_i$
$\left\{{\widetilde{d}}_i\right\}_{i=1}^{k'}$ can be extremely large. In such a case the condition
number of ${\mathbb A} - {\widetilde{d}}_i {\mathbb I}$ is practically equal to one. Obviously,
such systems do not need preconditioning. The next question is if we can replace their solution by
directly multiplying ${\mathbf f}$ with $-c_i/{\widetilde{d}}_i$. Comparative analysis of
numerical results is presented as a proof-of-concept for the proposed RS-BURA method.

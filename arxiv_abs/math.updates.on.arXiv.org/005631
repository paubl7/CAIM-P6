We obtain several fundamental results on finite index ideals and additive subgroups of rings as
well as on model-theoretic connected components of rings, which concern generating in finitely
many steps inside additive groups of rings. Let $R$ be any ring equipped with an arbitrary additional
first order structure, and $A$ a set of parameters. We show that whenever $H$ is an $A$-definable,
finite index subgroup of $(R,+)$, then $H+RH$ contains an $A$-definable, two-sided ideal of finite
index. As a corollary, we positively answer Question 3.9 of [Bohr compactifications of groups and
rings, J. Gismatullin, G. Jagiella and K. Krupi\'nski]: if $R$ is unital, then $(\bar R,+)^{00}_A
+ \bar R \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A + \bar R \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A = \bar R^{00}_A$, where $\bar R \succ
R$ is a sufficiently saturated elementary extension of $R$, and $(\bar R,+)^{00}_A$ [resp. $\bar
R^{00}_A$] is the smallest $A$-type-definable, bounded index additive subgroup [resp. ideal]
of $\bar R$. This implies that $\bar R^{00}_A=\bar R^{000}_A$, where $\bar R^{000}_A$ is the smallest
invariant over $A$, bounded index ideal of $\bar R$. If $R$ is of finite characteristic (not necessarily
unital), we get a sharper result: $(\bar R,+)^{00}_A + \bar R \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A = \bar R^{00}_A$.
We obtain similar results for finitely generated (not necessarily unital) rings and for topological
rings. The above results imply that the simplified descriptions of the definable (so also classical)
Bohr compactifications of triangular groups over unital rings obtained in Corollary 3.5 of the
aforementioned paper are valid for all unital rings. We analyze many examples, where we compute
the number of steps needed to generate a group by $(\bar R \cup \{1\}) \cdot (\bar R,+)^{00}_A$ and
study related aspects, showing "optimality" of some of our main results and answering some natural
questions.

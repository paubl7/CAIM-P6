One of the most profound questions of mathematical physics is that of establishing from first principles
the hydrodynamic equations in large, isolated, strongly interacting many-body systems. This
involves understanding relaxation at long times under reversible dynamics, determining the space
of emergent collective degrees of freedom (the ballistic waves), showing that projection occurs
onto them, and establishing their dynamics (the hydrodynamic equations). We make progress in these
directions, focussing for simplicity on one-dimensional systems. Under a model-independent
definition of the complete space of extensive conserved charges, we show that hydrodynamic projection
occurs in Euler-scale two-point correlation functions. A fundamental ingredient is a property
of relaxation: we establish ergodicity of correlation functions along almost every direction
in space-time. We further show that to every extensive conserved charge with a local density is associated
a local current and a continuity equation; and that Euler-scale two-point correlation functions
of local conserved densities satisfy a hydrodynamic equation. The results are established rigorously
within a general framework based on Hilbert spaces of observables. These spaces occur naturally
in the $C^*$ algebra description of statistical mechanics by the Gelfand-Naimark-Segal construction.
Using Araki's exponential clustering and the Lieb-Robinson bound, we show that the results hold,
for instance, in every nonzero-temperature Gibbs state of short-range quantum spin chains. Many
techniques we introduce are generalisable to higher dimensions. This provides a precise and universal
theory for the emergence of ballistic waves at the Euler scale and how they propagate within homogeneous,
stationary states.

An $n$-list $\lambda:=\left(r; \lambda_2, \ldots, \lambda_n\right)$ of complex numbers with
$r>0,$ is said to be realizable if $\lambda$ is the spectrum of $n\times n$ nonnegative matrix $A$
and in this case $A$ is said to be a nonnegative realization of $\lambda$. If, in addition, each row
and column sum of $A$ equals $r$, then $\lambda$ is said to be doubly stochastically realizable and
in such case $A$ is said to be a doubly stochastic realization for $\lambda$. In 1997, Guo proved that
if $\left(\lambda_2,\ldots, \lambda_n\right)$ is any list of complex numbers which is closed
under complex conjugation then there exists a least real number $\lambda_0$ with $\max\limits_{2\leq
j\leq n}|\lambda_j|\leq\lambda_0\leq 2n\max\limits_{2\leq j\leq n}|\lambda_j|$ such that
the list of complex numbers $\{ \lambda_1,\lambda_2,...,\lambda_n\}$ is realizable if and only
if $\lambda_1\geq \lambda_0$. In 2020, Julio and Soto showed that the upper bound may be reduced
to $(n-1)\max\limits_{2\leq j\leq n}|\lambda_j|$ in the case when at least one of the $\lambda_i$
is real. In this paper, we first describe an algorithm for passing from a nonnegative realization
to a doubly stochastic realization. As applications, we give a new sufficient condition for a stochastic
matrix $A$ to be cospectral to a doubly stochastic matrix $B$ and in this case $B$ is shown to be the
unique closest doubly stochastic matrix to $A$ with respect to the Frobenius norm. Then, our next
results slightly improve the upper bound for the nonnegative realization presented by Julio and
Soto and in the case when none of the $\lambda_i$ is real, we also give an improvement of Guo's bound.
Then, for doubly stochastic realizations, we obtain an upper bound that improves Guo's bound as
well. Finally, for certain particular cases, we give a further improvement of our last bound for
doubly stochastic realization.

In this paper, we study codes with sparse generator matrices. More specifically, low-density generator
matrix (LDGM) codes with a certain constraint on the weight of all the columns in the generator matrix
are considered. In this paper, it is first shown that when a binary-input memoryless symmetric (BMS)
channel $W$ and a constant $s>0$ are given, there exists a polarization kernel such that the corresponding
polar code is capacity-achieving and the column weights of the generator matrices are bounded from
above by $N^s$. Then, a general construction based on a concatenation of polar codes and a rate-$1$
code, and a new column-splitting algorithm that guarantees a much sparser generator matrix is given.
More specifically, for any BMS channel and any $\epsilon > 2\epsilon^*$, where $\epsilon^* \approx
0.085$, an existence of sequence of capacity-achieving codes with all the column wights of the generator
matrix upper bounded by $(\log N)^{1+\epsilon}$ is shown. Furthermore, coding schemes for BEC
and BMS channels, based on a second column-splitting algorithm are devised with low-complexity
decoding that uses successive-cancellation. The second splitting algorithm allows for the use
of a low-complexity decoder by preserving the reliability of the bit-channels observed by the source
bits, and by increasing the code block length. In particular, for any BEC and any $\lambda >\lambda^*
= 0.5+\epsilon^*$, the existence of a sequence of capacity-achieving codes where all the column
wights of the generator matrix are bounded from above by $(\log N)^{2\lambda}$ and with decoding
complexity $O(N\log \log N)$ is shown. The existence of similar capacity-achieving LDGM codes
with low-complexity decoding is shown for any BMS channel, and for any $\lambda >\lambda^{\dagger}
\approx 0.631$.

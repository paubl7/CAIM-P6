Synaptic communication is based on a biological Molecular Communication (MC) system which may
serve as a blueprint for the design of synthetic MC systems. However, the physical modeling of synaptic
MC is complicated by the possible saturation of the molecular receiver caused by the competition
of neurotransmitters (NTs) for postsynaptic receptors. Receiver saturation renders the system
behavior nonlinear in the number of released NTs and is commonly neglected in existing analytical
models. Furthermore, due to the ligands' competition for receptors (and vice versa), the individual
binding events at the molecular receiver are in general statistically dependent and the binomial
model for the statistics of the received signal does not apply. In this work, we propose a novel deterministic
model for receptor saturation in terms of a state-space description based on an eigenfunction expansion
of Fick's diffusion equation. The presented solution is numerically stable and computationally
efficient. Employing the proposed deterministic model, we show that saturation at the molecular
receiver reduces the peak-value of the expected received signal and accelerates the clearance
of NTs as compared to the case when receptor occupancy is neglected. We further derive a statistical
model for the received signal in terms of the hypergeometric distribution which accounts for the
competition of NTs for receptors and the competition of receptors for NTs. The proposed statistical
model reveals how the signal statistics are shaped by the number of released NTs, the number of receptors,
and the binding kinetics of the receptors, respectively, in the presence of competition. We show
that the impact of these parameters on the signal variance depends on the relative numbers of NTs
and receptors. The accuracy of the proposed deterministic and statistical models is verified by
particle-based computer simulations.

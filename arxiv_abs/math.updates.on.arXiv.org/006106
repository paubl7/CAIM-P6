Highly accurate numerical or physical experiments are often time-consuming or expensive to obtain.
When time or budget restrictions prohibit the generation of additional data, the amount of available
samples may be too limited to provide satisfactory model results. Multi-fidelity methods deal
with such problems by incorporating information from other sources, which are ideally well-correlated
with the high-fidelity data, but can be obtained at a lower cost. By leveraging correlations between
different data sets, multi-fidelity methods often yield superior generalization when compared
to models based solely on a small amount of high-fidelity data. In this work, we present the use of
artificial neural networks applied to multi-fidelity regression problems. By elaborating a few
existing approaches, we propose new neural network architectures for multi-fidelity regression.
The introduced models are compared against a traditional multi-fidelity scheme, co-kriging.
A collection of artificial benchmarks are presented to measure the performance of the analyzed
models. The results show that cross-validation in combination with Bayesian optimization consistently
leads to neural network models that outperform the co-kriging scheme. Additionally, we show an
application of multi-fidelity regression to an engineering problem. The propagation of a pressure
wave into an acoustic horn with parametrized shape and frequency is considered, and the index of
reflection intensity is approximated using the multi-fidelity models. A finite element model
and a reduced basis model are adopted as the high- and low-fidelity, respectively. It is shown that
the multi-fidelity neural network returns outputs that achieve a comparable accuracy to those
from the expensive, full-order model, using only very few full-order evaluations combined with
a larger amount of inaccurate but cheap evaluations of a reduced order model.

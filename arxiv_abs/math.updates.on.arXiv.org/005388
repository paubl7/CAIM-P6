When dynamical systems that produce rhythmic behaviors operate within hard limits, they may exhibit
limit cycles with sliding components, that is, closed isolated periodic orbits that make and break
contact with a constraint surface. Examples include heel-ground interaction in locomotion, firing
rate rectification in neural networks and stick-slip oscillators. In many rhythmic systems, robustness
against external perturbations involves response of both the shape and the timing of the limit cycle
trajectory. The existing methods of infinitesimal phase response curve (iPRC) and variational
analysis are well established for quantifying changes in timing and shape for smooth systems. These
tools have recently been extended to nonsmooth dynamics with transversal crossing boundaries.
In this work, we further extend the iPRC method to nonsmooth systems with sliding components, which
enables us to make predictions about the synchronization properties of weakly coupled stick-slip
oscillators. We observe a new feature of the isochrons in a planar limit cycle with hard sliding boundaries.
Moreover, the classical variational analysis neglects timing information and is restricted to
instantaneous perturbations. By defining the "infinitesimal shape response curve" (iSRC), we
incorporate timing sensitivity of an oscillator to describe the shape response of this oscillator
to parametric perturbations. In order to extract timing information, we also develop a "local timing
response curve" (lTRC) that measures the timing sensitivity of a limit cycle within any given region.
We demonstrate in a specific example that taking into account local timing sensitivity in a nonsmooth
system greatly improves the accuracy of the iSRC over global timing analysis given by the iPRC.

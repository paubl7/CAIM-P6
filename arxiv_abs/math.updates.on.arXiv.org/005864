To each monoid $P$ that embeds in a group we associate a universal Toeplitz C*-algebra $T_u(P)$ defined
via generators and relations; $T_u(P)$ is a quotient of Li's semigroup C*-algebra $C^*(P)$ and
they are isomorphic if and only if $P$ satisfies independence. We give a partial crossed product
realization of $T_u(P)$ and show that several key results known for $C^*(P)$ when $P$ satisfies
independence are also valid for $T_u(P)$ when independence fails. At the level of the reduced semigroup
C*-algebra $T_r(P)$, we show that nontrivial ideals have nontrivial intersection with the reduced
crossed product of the diagonal subalgebra by the action of the group of units of $P$, generalizing
a result of Li for monoids with trivial unit group. We also characterize when the action of the group
of units is topologically free and we show that in this case a representation of $T_r(P)$ is faithful
iff it is jointly proper. This yields a uniqueness theorem for C*-algebras generated by semigroups
of isometries that unifies several classical results. We provide a presentation for the covariance
algebra of the product system over $P$ with one-dimensional fibers in terms of a notion of foundation
sets of constructible ideals that generalizes that of Sims and Yeend for quasi-lattice orders.
The covariance algebra is a full, or universal, analogue of the boundary quotient. We give purely
algebraic sufficient conditions on $P$ for the boundary quotient to be purely infinite simple,
which reduce to Starling's conditions in the case of right LCM monoids. We discuss applications
of our results to examples that include a numerical semigroup and the $ax+b$-monoid of an integral
domain. This is particularly interesting in the case of nonmaximal orders in number fields, for
which we show independence always fails. In addition, we simplify and generalize results for right
LCM monoids.

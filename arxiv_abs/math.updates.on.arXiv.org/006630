We consider the nonlinear stability of spectrally stable periodic waves in the Lugiato-Lefever
equation (LLE), a damped nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation with forcing that arises in nonlinear
optics. So far, nonlinear stability of such solutions has only been established against co-periodic
perturbations by exploiting the existence of a spectral gap. In this paper, we consider perturbations
which are localized, i.e., integrable on the line. Such localized perturbations naturally yield
the absence of a spectral gap, so we must rely on a substantially different method with origins in
the stability analysis of periodic waves in reaction-diffusion systems. The relevant linear estimates
have been obtained in recent work by the first three authors through a delicate decomposition of
the associated linearized solution operator. Since its most critical part just decays diffusively,
the nonlinear iteration can only be closed if one allows for a spatio-temporal phase modulation.
However, the modulated perturbation satisfies a quasilinear equation yielding an inherent loss
of regularity which, due to the low-order damping in the LLE, cannot be regained using standard methods.
Therefore, in contrast to the case of reaction-diffusion systems, the nonlinear iteration cannot
be closed for the modulated perturbation. In this work, we present a new nonlinear iteration scheme
incorporating tame estimates on the unmodulated perturbation, which satisfies a semilinear equation
in which no derivatives are lost, yet where decay is too slow to close an independent iteration scheme.
We obtain nonlinear stability of periodic steady waves in the LLE against localized perturbations
with precisely the same decay rates as predicted by the linear theory.

The path measure corresponding to the Fr\"ohlich Polaron appearing in quantum statistical mechanics
is defined as the tilted measure $$ \widehat{\mathbb P}_{\varepsilon,T}= \frac{1}{Z(\varepsilon,T)}\exp\bigg(\frac{1}{2}\int_{-T}^T\int_{-T}^T
\frac{\varepsilon\mathrm e^{-\varepsilon |t-s|}}{|\omega(t)-\omega(s)|} \mathrm d s \,\mathrm
d t\bigg)\mathrm d\mathbb P. $$ Here $\varepsilon>0$ is the Kac parameter (or the inverse-coupling),
and $\mathbb P$ is the law of $3d$ Brownian increments. In [13] it was shown that the (thermodynamic)
limit $\lim_{T\to\infty}\widehat{\mathbb P}_{\varepsilon,T}=\widehat{\mathbb P}_\varepsilon$
exists as a process with stationary increments and this limit was identified explicitly as a mixture
of Gaussian processes. In the present article, the strong coupling limit or the vanishing Kac parameter
limit $\lim_{\varepsilon\to 0} \widehat{\mathbb P}_\varepsilon$ is investigated. It is shown
that this limit exists and coincides with the increments of the Pekar process, which is a stationary
diffusion process with generator $\frac 12 \Delta+ (\nabla\psi/\psi)\cdot \nabla$, where $\psi$
is the unique (modulo shifts) maximizer of the Pekar variational problem $$ g_0=\sup_{\|\psi\|_2=1}
\Big\{\int_{\mathbb R^3}\int_{\mathbb R^3}\,\psi^2(x) \psi^2(y)|x-y|^{-1}\mathrm d x\mathrm
d y -\frac 12\|\nabla \psi\|_2^2\Big\}. $$ As shown in [12,6,1], the Pekar process is itself approximated
by the limiting "mean-field Polaron measures", and thus, the present identification of the strong
coupling Polaron is a rigorous justification of the "mean-field approximation" (on the level of
path measures) conjectured by Spohn in [15]. This approximation in the vanishing Kac limit ($\varepsilon\to
0$) is also shown to hold for a general class of Kac-Interaction of the form $H(t,x)=\varepsilon
\mathrm e^{-\varepsilon|t|} V(x)$ where $V$ is any continuous function vanishing at infinity.

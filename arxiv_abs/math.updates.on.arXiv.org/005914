One of the open problems in Algebraic topology is the Peterson hit problem for a module over the mod
2 Steenrod algebra $\mathscr A$. More specifically, this problem asks a minimal set of generators
for the polynomial algebra $\mathcal P_m:=\mathbb F_2[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m]$ regarded as a connected
unstable $\mathscr A$-module on $m$ variables $x_1, \ldots, x_m,$ each of degree one. The algebra
$\mathcal P_m$ is the cohomology with $\mathbb F_2$-coefficients of the product of $m$ copies of
the Eilenberg-MacLan space of type $(\mathbb F_2, 1).$ The hit problem has been thoroughly studied
for 35 years in a variety of contexts by many authors and completely solved for $m\leq 4.$ Furthermore,
it is applied in studying the cohomology of $\mathscr A$ via the $m$-th Singer algebraic transfer
$Tr_m.$ The aim of this work is to continue our study of the Peterson hit problem in the case $m = 5$ and
the fifth Singer algebraic transfer. More precisely, we extend our result in [24] on the hit problem
for $\mathscr A$-module $\mathcal P_5$ in the generic degree $5(2^t-1) + 18.2^t$ with $t$ an arbitrary
non-negative integer. This result confirms Sum's conjecture on the relation between the minimal
set of $\mathscr A$-generators for the polynomial algebras $\mathcal P_5$ and $\mathcal P_{4}$
in the above degree. Moreover, by using our result [24] and a presentation in the Lambda algebra of
the fifth Singer transfer, we show that the non-trivial element $h_0f_0 = h_1e_0\in {\rm Ext}_{\mathscr
A}^{5, 5+(5(2^0-1) + 18.2^0)}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2)$ is in the image of $Tr_5$ and that $Tr_5$
is an isomorphism in the bidegree $(5, 5+(5(2^0-1) + 18.2^0)).$ In addition, the behavior of $Tr_5$
in the bidegree $(5, 5+(5(2^t-1) + 18.2^t))$ when $t\geq 1$ was also discussed. This method is different
from that of Singer in studying the image of the algebraic transfer.

An algebraic expression $3 + 2 + 6$ can be evaluated to $11$, but it can also be partially evaluated
to $5 + 6$. In categorical algebra, such partial evaluations can be defined in terms of the $1$-skeleton
of the bar construction for algebras of a monad. We show that this partial evaluation relation can
be seen as the relation internal to the category of algebras generated by relating a formal expression
to its result. The relation is transitive for many monads which describe commonly encountered algebraic
structures, and more generally for BC monads on Set, defined by the underlying functor and multiplication
being weakly cartesian. We find that this is not true for all monads: we describe a finitary monad
on Set for which the partial evaluation relation on the terminal algebra is not transitive. With
the perspective of higher algebraic rewriting in mind, we then investigate the compositional structure
of the bar construction in all dimensions. We show that for algebras of BC monads, the bar construction
has fillers for all directed acyclic configurations in $\Delta^n$, but generally not all inner
horns. We introduce several additional completeness and exactness conditions on simplicial sets
which correspond via the bar construction to composition and invertibility properties of partial
evaluations, including those arising from weakly cartesian monads. In order to provide simplified
presentations of these conditions and relate them to more familiar properties of simplicial sets,
we characterize and produce factorizations of pushouts and certain commutative squares in the
simplex category. Most notably, the properties we consider correspond to weak analogues of the
exactness properties characterizing the $1$- and $2$-Segal conditions of Dyckerhoff and Kapranov,
as well as additional exactness conditions studied by G\'{a}lvez, Kock, and Tonks.

We bound the average number of $2$-torsion elements in the class group of monogenised fields of odd
degree (and compute it precisely conditional on a tail estimate) using an orbit parametrisation
of Wood. Curiously, we find that the average number of non-trivial $2$-torsion elements in the class
group of monogenised fields of any given odd degree is twice the value predicted for the full family
of fields of that degree by the Cohen-Lenstra-Martinet-Malle heuristic! We also find that monogenicity
has an increasing effect on the average number of non-trivial $2$-torsion elements in the narrow
class group. In addition, we obtain unconditional statements for monogenised rings of odd degree.
For an order $\mathcal{O}$, denote by $\mathcal{I}_2(\mathcal{O})$ the group of $2$-torsion
ideals of $\mathcal{O}$. We show that the average value of the difference $ \left|{\rm Cl_2}(\mathcal{O})\right|-2^{1-r_1-r_2}\left|
\mathcal{I}_2(\mathcal{O}) \right|$ over all monogenised orders $\mathcal{O}$ of fixed signature
$(r_1,r_2)$ is $1+2^{1-r_1-r_2}$. For $3$-torsion in quadratic orders, $2$-torsion in cubic
orders, and $2$-torsion in orders arising from odd degree binary forms, work of Bhargava-Varma
and Ho-Shankar-Varma shows that the corresponding difference averaged over the full family of
orders is equal to $1$. This shows that monogenicity has an increasing effect not only on the class
group of fields, but also on the class group of orders. Our method gives a dual proof of a result of Bhargava-Hanke-Shankar
in the cubic case, reveals an interesting structure underpinning the deviation of these averages
from those expected for the full families, and extends to the case of monogenised rings and fields
of even degree at least $4$.

Reliable and efficient trajectory generation methods are a fundamental need for autonomous dynamical
systems of tomorrow. The goal of this article is to provide a comprehensive tutorial of three major
convex optimization-based trajectory generation methods: lossless convexification (LCvx),
and two sequential convex programming algorithms known as SCvx and GuSTO. In this article, trajectory
generation is the computation of a dynamically feasible state and control signal that satisfies
a set of constraints while optimizing key mission objectives. The trajectory generation problem
is almost always nonconvex, which typically means that it is not readily amenable to efficient and
reliable solution onboard an autonomous vehicle. The three algorithms that we discuss use problem
reformulation and a systematic algorithmic strategy to nonetheless solve nonconvex trajectory
generation tasks through the use of a convex optimizer. The theoretical guarantees and computational
speed offered by convex optimization have made the algorithms popular in both research and industry
circles. To date, the list of applications includes rocket landing, spacecraft hypersonic reentry,
spacecraft rendezvous and docking, aerial motion planning for fixed-wing and quadrotor vehicles,
robot motion planning, and more. Among these applications are high-profile rocket flights conducted
by organizations like NASA, Masten Space Systems, SpaceX, and Blue Origin. This article aims to
give the reader the tools and understanding necessary to work with each algorithm, and to know what
each method can and cannot do. A publicly available source code repository supports the provided
numerical examples. By the end of the article, the reader should be ready to use the methods, to extend
them, and to contribute to their many exciting modern applications.

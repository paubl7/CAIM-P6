In this paper we investigate the spread of advantageous genes in two variants of the F-KPP model with
dormancy. The first variant, in which dormant individuals do not move in space and instead form "localized
seed banks", has recently been introduced in Blath, Hammer and Nie (2020). However, there, only
a relatively crude upper bound for the critical speed of potential travelling wave solutions has
been provided. The second model variant is new and describes a situation in which the dormant forms
of individuals are subject to motion, while the "active" individuals remain spatially static instead.
This can be motivated e.g. by spore dispersal of fungi, where the "dormant" spores are distributed
by wind, water or insects, while the "active" fungi are locally fixed. For both models, we establish
the existence of monotone travelling wave solutions, determine the corresponding critical wave-speed
in terms of the model parameters, and characterize aspects of the asymptotic shape of the waves depending
on the decay properties of the initial condition. Interestingly, the slow-down effect of dormancy
on the speed of propagation of beneficial alleles is often more serious in model variant II (the "spore
model") than in variant I (the "seed bank model"), and this can be understood mathematically via
probabilistic representations of solutions in terms of (two variants of) "on/off branching Brownian
motions". Our proofs make rather heavy use of probabilistic tools in the tradition of McKean (1975),
Bramson (1978), Neveu (1987), Lalley and Sellke (1987), Champneys et al (1995) and others. However,
the two-compartment nature of the model and the special forms of dormancy also pose obstacles to
the classical formalism, giving rise to a variety of open research questions that we briefly discuss
at the end of the paper.

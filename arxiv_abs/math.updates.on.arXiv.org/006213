Inter-carrier interference (ICI) poses a significant challenge for OFDM joint radar-communications
(JRC) systems in high-mobility scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel ICI-aware sensing algorithm
for MIMO-OFDM JRC systems to detect the presence of multiple targets and estimate their delay-Doppler-angle
parameters. First, leveraging the observation that spatial covariance matrix is independent
of target delays and Dopplers, we perform angle estimation via the MUSIC algorithm. For each estimated
angle, we next formulate the radar delay-Doppler estimation as a joint carrier frequency offset
(CFO) and channel estimation problem via an APES (amplitude and phase estimation) spatial filtering
approach by transforming the delay-Doppler parameterized radar channel into an unstructured
form. To account for the presence of multiple targets at a given angle, we devise an iterative interference
cancellation based orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) procedure, where at each iteration the generalized
likelihood ratio test (GLRT) detector is employed to form decision statistics, providing as by-products
the maximum likelihood estimates (MLEs) of radar channels and CFOs. In the final step, target detection
is performed in delay-Doppler domain using target-specific, ICI-decontaminated channel estimates
over time and frequency, where CFO estimates are utilized to resolve Doppler ambiguities, thereby
turning ICI from foe to friend. The proposed algorithm can further exploit the ICI effect to introduce
an additional dimension (namely, CFO) for target resolvability, which enables resolving targets
located at the same delay-Doppler-angle cell. Simulation results illustrate the ICI exploitation
capability of the proposed approach and showcase its superior detection and estimation performance
in high-mobility scenarios over conventional methods.

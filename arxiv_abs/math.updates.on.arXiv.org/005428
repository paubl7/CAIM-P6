The electricity market, which was initially designed for dispatchable power plants and inflexible
demand, is being increasingly challenged by new trends, such as the high penetration of intermittent
renewables and the transformation of the consumers energy space. To accommodate these new trends
and improve the performance of the market, several modifications to current market designs have
been proposed in the literature. Given the vast variety of these proposals, this paper provides
a comprehensive investigation of the modifications proposed in the literature as well as a detailed
assessment of their suitability for improving market performance under the continuously evolving
electricity landscape. To this end, first, a set of criteria for an ideal market design is proposed,
and the barriers present in current market designs hindering the fulfillment of these criteria
are identified. Then, the different market solutions proposed in the literature, which could potentially
mitigate these barriers, are extensively explored. Finally, a taxonomy of the proposed solutions
is presented, highlighting the barriers addressed by each proposal and the associated implementation
challenges. The outcomes of this analysis show that even though each barrier is addressed by at least
one proposed solution, no single proposal is able to address all the barriers simultaneously. In
this regard, a future-proof market design must combine different elements of proposed solutions
to comprehensively mitigate market barriers and overcome the identified implementation challenges.
Thus, by thoroughly reviewing this rich body of literature, this paper introduces key contributions
enabling the advancement of the state-of-the-art towards increasingly efficient electricity
market.

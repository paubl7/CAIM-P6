Grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (GF-NOMA) is a potential technique to support massive
Ultra-Reliable and Low-Latency Communication (mURLLC) service. However, the dynamic resource
configuration in GF-NOMA systems is challenging due to random traffics and collisions, that are
unknown at the base station (BS). Meanwhile, joint consideration of the latency and reliability
requirements makes the resource configuration of GF-NOMA for mURLLC more complex. To address this
problem, we develop a general learning framework for signature-based GF-NOMA in mURLLC service
taking into account the multiple access signature collision, the UE detection, as well as the data
decoding procedures for the K-repetition GF and the Proactive GF schemes. The goal of our learning
framework is to maximize the long-term average number of successfully served users (UEs) under
the latency constraint. We first perform a real-time repetition value configuration based on a
double deep Q-Network (DDQN) and then propose a Cooperative Multi-Agent learning technique based
on the DQN (CMA-DQN) to optimize the configuration of both the repetition values and the contention-transmission
unit (CTU) numbers. Our results show that the number of successfully served UEs under the same latency
constraint in our proposed learning framework is up to ten times for the K-repetition scheme, and
two times for the Proactive scheme, more than that with fixed repetition values and CTU numbers.
In addition, the superior performance of CMA-DQN over the conventional load estimation-based
approach (LE-URC) demonstrates its capability in dynamically configuring in long term. Importantly,
our general learning framework can be used to optimize the resource configuration problems in all
the signature-based GF-NOMA schemes.

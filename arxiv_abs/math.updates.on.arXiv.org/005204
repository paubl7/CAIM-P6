The analysis and visualization of tensor fields is a very challenging task. Besides the cases of
zeroth- and first-order tensors, most techniques focus on symmetric second-order tensors. Only
a few works concern totally symmetric tensors of higher-order. Work on other tensors of higher-order
than two is exceptionally rare. We believe that one major reason for this gap is the lack of knowledge
about suitable tensor decompositions for the general higher-order tensors. We focus here on three
dimensions as most applications are concerned with three-dimensional space. A lot of work on symmetric
second-order tensors uses the spectral decomposition. The work on totally symmetric higher-order
tensors deals frequently with a decomposition based on spherical harmonics. These decompositions
do not directly apply to general tensors of higher-order in three dimensions. However, another
option available is the deviatoric decomposition for such tensors, splitting them into deviators.
Together with the multipole representation of deviators, it allows to describe any tensor in three
dimensions uniquely by a set of directions and non-negative scalars. The specific appeal of this
methodology is its general applicability, opening up a potentially general route to tensor interpretation.
The underlying concepts, however, are not broadly understood in the engineering community. In
this article, we therefore gather information about this decomposition from a range of literature
sources. The goal is to collect and prepare the material for further analysis and give other researchers
the chance to work in this direction. This article wants to stimulate the use of this decomposition
and the search for interpretation of this unique algebraic property. A first step in this direction
is given by a detailed analysis of the multipole representation of symmetric second-order three-dimensional
tensors.

Given a bounded sequence \omega of positive numbers and its associated unilateral weighted shift
W_{\omega} acting on the Hilbert space \ell^2(\mathbb{Z}_+), we consider natural representations
of W_{\omega} as a 2-variable weighted shift, acting on \ell^2(\mathbb{Z}_+^2). Alternatively,
we seek to examine the various ways in which the sequence \omega can give rise to a 2-variable weight
diagram. Our best (and more general) embedding arises from looking at two polynomials p and q nonnegative
on a closed interval I in R_+ and the double-indexed moment sequence \{\int p(r)^k q(r)^{\ell} d\sigma(r)\}_{k,\ell
\in \mathbb{Z}_+}, where W_{\omega} is assumed to be subnormal with Berger measure \sigma such
that \supp \; \sigma \subseteq I; we call such an embedding a (p,q)-embedding of W_{\omega}. We prove
that every (p,q)-embedding of a subnormal weighted shift W_{\omega} is (jointly) subnormal, and
we explicitly compute its Berger measure. We apply this result to answer three outstanding questions:
(i) Can the Bergman shift A_2 be embedded in a subnormal 2-variable spherically isometric weighted
shift W_{(\alpha,\beta)}? If so, what is the Berger measure of W_{(\alpha,\beta)}? (ii) Can a contractive
subnormal unilateral weighted shift be always embedded in a spherically isometric 2-variable
weighted shift? (iii) Does there exist a hyponormal 2-variable weighted shift \Theta(W_{\omega})
(where \Theta(W_{\omega}) denotes the classical embedding of a hyponormal unilateral weighted
shift W_{\omega}) such that some integer power of \Theta(W_{\omega}) is not hyponormal? As another
application, we find an alternative way to compute the Berger measure of the Agler j-th shift A_{j}
(j\geq 2). Our research uses techniques from the theory of disintegration of measures, Riesz functionals,
and the functional calculus for the columns of the moment matrix associated to a polynomial embedding.

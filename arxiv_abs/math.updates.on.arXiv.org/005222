We analyze a random lozenge tiling model of a large regular hexagon, whose underlying weight structure
is periodic of period $2$ in both the horizontal and vertical directions. This is a determinantal
point process whose correlation kernel is expressed in terms of non-Hermitian matrix valued orthogonal
polynomials. This model belongs to a class of models for which the existing techniques for studying
asymptotics cannot be applied. The novel part of our method consists of establishing a connection
between matrix valued and scalar valued orthogonal polynomials. This allows to simplify the double
contour formula for the kernel obtained by Duits and Kuijlaars by reducing the size of a Riemann-Hilbert
problem. The proof relies on the fact that the matrix valued weight possesses eigenvalues that live
on an underlying Riemann surface $\mathcal{M}$ of genus $0$. We consider this connection of independent
interest; it is natural to expect that similar ideas can be used for other matrix valued orthogonal
polynomials, as long as the corresponding Riemann surface $\mathcal{M}$ is of genus $0$. The rest
of the method consists of two parts, and mainly follows the lines of a previous work of Charlier, Duits,
Kuijlaars and Lenells. First, we perform a Deift-Zhou steepest descent analysis to obtain asymptotics
for the scalar valued orthogonal polynomials. The main difficulty is the study of an equilibrium
problem in the complex plane. Second, the asymptotics for the orthogonal polynomials are substituted
in the double contour integral and the latter is analyzed using the saddle point method. Our main
results are the limiting densities of the lozenges in the disordered flower-shaped region. However,
we stress that the method allows in principle to rigorously compute other meaningful probabilistic
quantities in the model.

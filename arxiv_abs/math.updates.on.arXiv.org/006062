We propose and compare methods for the analysis of extreme events in complex systems governed by
PDEs that involve random parameters, in situations where we are interested in quantifying the probability
that a scalar function of the system's solution is above a threshold. If this threshold is large,
this probability is small and its accurate estimation is challenging. To tackle this difficulty,
we blend theoretical results from large deviation theory (LDT) with numerical tools from PDE-constrained
optimization. Our methods first compute parameters that minimize the LDT-rate function over the
set of parameters leading to extreme events, using adjoint methods to compute the gradient of this
rate function. The minimizers give information about the mechanism of the extreme events as well
as estimates of their probability. We then propose a series of methods to refine these estimates,
either via importance sampling or geometric approximation of the extreme event sets. Results are
formulated for general parameter distributions and detailed expressions are provided when these
distribution are Gaussian. We give theoretical and numerical arguments showing that the performance
of our methods is insensitive to the extremeness of the events we are interested in. We illustrate
the application of our approach to quantify the probability of extreme tsunami events on shore.
Tsunamis are typically caused by a sudden, unpredictable change of the ocean floor elevation during
an earthquake. We model this change as a random process, which takes into account the underlying
physics. We use the one-dimensional shallow water equation to model tsunamis numerically. In the
context of this example, we present a comparison of our methods for extreme event probability estimation,
and find which type of ocean floor elevation change leads to the largest tsunamis on shore.

We study the problem of approximating the cone of positive semidefinite (PSD) matrices with a cone
that can be described by smaller-sized PSD constraints. Specifically, we ask the question: "how
closely can we approximate the set of unit-trace $n \times n$ PSD matrices, denoted by $D$, using
at most $N$ number of $k \times k$ PSD constraints?" In this paper, we prove lower bounds on $N$ to achieve
a good approximation of $D$ by considering two constructions of an approximating set. First, we
consider the unit-trace $n \times n$ symmetric matrices that are PSD when restricted to a fixed set
of $k$-dimensional subspaces in $\mathbb{RR}^n$. We prove that if this set is a good approximation
of $D$, then the number of subspaces must be at least exponentially large in $n$ for any $k = o(n)$.
% Second, we show that any set $S$ that approximates $D$ within a constant approximation ratio must
have superpolynomial $\mathbf{S}_+^k$-extension complexity. To be more precise, if $S$ is a constant
factor approximation of $D$, then $S$ must have $\mathbf{S}_+^k$-extension complexity at least
$\exp( C \cdot \min \{ \sqrt{n}, n/k \})$ where $C$ is some absolute constant. In addition, we show
that any set $S$ such that $D \subseteq S$ and the Gaussian width of $D$ is at most a constant times larger
than the Gaussian width of $D$ must have $\mathbf{S}_+^k$-extension complexity at least $\exp(
C \cdot \min \{ n^{1/3}, \sqrt{n/k} \})$. These results imply that the cone of $n \times n$ PSD matrices
cannot be approximated by a polynomial number of $k \times k$ PSD constraints for any $k = o(n / \log^2
n)$. These results generalize the recent work of Fawzi on the hardness of polyhedral approximations
of $\mathbf{S}_+^n$, which corresponds to the special case with $k=1$.

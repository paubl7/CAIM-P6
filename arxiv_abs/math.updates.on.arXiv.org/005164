Let T be a torus, X a smooth quasi-compact separated scheme equipped with a T-action, and [X/T] the
associated quotient stack. Given any localizing A$^1$-homotopy invariant E of dg categories,
we prove that the derived completion of E([X/T]) at the augmentation ideal I of the representation
ring R(T) of T agrees with the classical Borel construction associated to the T-action on X. As a first
application, we obtain an alternative proof of Krishna's completion theorem in algebraic K-theory,
of Thomason's completion theorem in \'etale K-theory with coefficients, and also of Atiyah-Segal's
completion theorem in topological K-theory (for those topological M-spaces X$^{a}$ arising from
analytification; M is a(ny) maximal compact Lie subgroup of T$^a$). These alternative proofs lead
to a spectral enrichment of the corresponding completion theorems and also to the following improvements:
in the case of Thomason's completion theorem the base field k no longer needs to be separably closed
and X no longer needs to be of finite type over k, and in the case of Atiyah-Segal's completion theorem
the topological M-space X$^a$ no longer needs to be compact and the M-equivariant topological K-theory
groups of X$^a$ no longer need to be finitely generated over R(M). As a second application, we obtain
new completion theorems in l-adic \'etale K-theory, in (real) semi-topological K-theory and also
in periodic cyclic homology. As a third application, we obtain a purely algebraic description of
the different T-equivariant cohomology groups of X (motivic, l-adic, (real) morphic, Betti, de
Rham, etc) in terms of the completion at the augmentation ideal I of the different localizing A$^1$-homotopy
invariants of the quotient stack [X/T]. Finally, in an appendix of independent interest, we extend
a result of Weibel concerning homotopy K-theory from the realm of schemes to the broad setting of
quotient stacks.

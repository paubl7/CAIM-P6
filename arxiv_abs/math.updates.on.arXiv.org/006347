Let $V$ be a vertex operator algebra with a category $\mathcal{C}$ of (generalized) modules that
has vertex tensor category structure, and thus braided tensor category structure, and let $A$ be
a vertex operator (super)algebra extension of $V$. We employ tensor categories to study untwisted
(also called local) $A$-modules in $\mathcal{C}$, using results of Huang-Kirillov-Lepowsky
showing that $A$ is a (super)algebra object in $\mathcal{C}$ and that generalized $A$-modules
in $\mathcal{C}$ correspond exactly to local modules for the corresponding (super)algebra object.
Both categories, of local modules for a $\mathcal{C}$-algebra and (under suitable conditions)
of generalized $A$-modules, have natural braided monoidal category structure, given in the first
case by Pareigis and Kirillov-Ostrik and in the second case by Huang-Lepowsky-Zhang. Our main result
is that the Huang-Kirillov-Lepowsky isomorphism of categories between local (super)algebra
modules and extended vertex operator (super)algebra modules is also an isomorphism of braided
monoidal (super)categories. Using this result, we show that induction from a suitable subcategory
of $V$-modules to $A$-modules is a vertex tensor functor. We give two applications. First, we derive
Verlinde formulae for regular vertex operator superalgebras and regular $(1/2)\mathbb{Z}$-graded
vertex operator algebras by realizing them as (super)algebra objects in the vertex tensor categories
of their even and $\mathbb{Z}$-graded components, respectively. Second, we analyze parafermionic
cosets $C=\mathrm{Com}(V_L,V)$ where $L$ is a positive definite even lattice and $V$ is regular.
If the category of either $V$-modules or $C$-modules is understood, then our results classify all
inequivalent simple modules for the other algebra and determine their fusion rules and modular
character transformations. We illustrate both directions with several examples.

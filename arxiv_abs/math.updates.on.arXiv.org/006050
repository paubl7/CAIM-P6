Light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation (laser) sources have many advantages
for use in high data rate optical wireless communications. In particular, the low cost and high-bandwidth
properties of laser sources such as vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) make them
attractive for future indoor optical wireless communications. In order to be integrated into future
indoor networks, such lasers should conform to eye safety regulations determined by the international
electrotechnical commission (IEC) standards for laser safety. In this paper, we provide a detailed
study of beam propagation to evaluate the received power of various laser sources, based on which
as well as the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) defined by the IEC 60825-1:2014 standard, we establish
a comprehensive framework for eye safety analyses. This framework allows us to calculate the maximum
allowable transmit power, which is crucial in the design of a reliable and safe laser-based wireless
communication system. Initially, we consider a single-mode Gaussian beam and calculate the maximum
permissible transmit power. Subsequently, we generalize this approach for higher-mode beams.
It is shown that the M-squared-based approach for analysis of multimode lasers ensures the IEC eye
safety limits, however, in some scenarios, it can be too conservative compared to the precise beam
decomposition method. Laser safety analyses with consideration of optical elements such as lens
and diffuser, as well as for VCSEL array have been also presented. Skin safety, as another significant
factor of laser safety, has also been investigated in this paper. We have studied the impacts of various
parameters such as wavelength, exposure duration and the divergence angle of laser sources on the
safety analysis by presenting insightful results.

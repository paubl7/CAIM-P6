Imagine a coverage area where each mobile device is communicating with a preferred set of wireless
access points (among many) that are selected based on its needs and cooperate to jointly serve it,
instead of creating autonomous cells. This effectively leads to a user-centric post-cellular
network architecture, which can resolve many of the interference issues and service-quality variations
that appear in cellular networks. This concept is called User-centric Cell-free Massive MIMO (multiple-input
multiple-output) and has its roots in the intersection between three technology components: Massive
MIMO, coordinated multipoint processing, and ultra-dense networks. The main challenge is to achieve
the benefits of cell-free operation in a practically feasible way, with computational complexity
and fronthaul requirements that are scalable to enable massively large networks with many mobile
devices. This monograph covers the foundations of User-centric Cell-free Massive MIMO, starting
from the motivation and mathematical definition. It continues by describing the state-of-the-art
signal processing algorithms for channel estimation, uplink data reception, and downlink data
transmission with either centralized or distributed implementation. The achievable spectral
efficiency is mathematically derived and evaluated numerically using a running example that exposes
the impact of various system parameters and algorithmic choices. The fundamental tradeoffs between
communication performance, computational complexity, and fronthaul signaling requirements
are thoroughly analyzed. Finally, the basic algorithms for pilot assignment, dynamic cooperation
cluster formation, and power optimization are provided, while open problems related to these and
other resource allocation problems are reviewed. All the numerical examples can be reproduced
using the accompanying Matlab code.

In electrocardiography, the "classic" inverse problem is the reconstruction of electric potentials
at a surface enclosing the heart from remote recordings at the body surface and an accurate description
of the anatomy. The latter being affected by noise and obtained with limited resolution due to clinical
constraints, a possibly large uncertainty may be perpetuated in the inverse reconstruction. The
purpose of this work is to study the effect of shape uncertainty on the forward and the inverse problem
of electrocardiography. To this aim, the problem is first recast into a boundary integral formulation
and then discretised with a collocation method to achieve high convergence rates and a fast time
to solution. The shape uncertainty of the domain is represented by a random deformation field defined
on a reference configuration. We propose a periodic-in-time covariance kernel for the random field
and approximate the Karhunen-Lo\`eve expansion using low-rank techniques for fast sampling.
The space-time uncertainty in the expected potential and its variance is evaluated with an anisotropic
sparse quadrature approach and validated by a quasi-Monte Carlo method. We present several numerical
experiments on a simplified but physiologically grounded 2-dimensional geometry to illustrate
the validity of the approach. The tested parametric dimension ranged from 100 up to 600. For the forward
problem the sparse quadrature is very effective. In the inverse problem, the sparse quadrature
and the quasi-Monte Carlo method perform as expected, except for the total variation regularisation,
where convergence is limited by lack of regularity. We finally investigate an $H^{1/2}$ regularisation,
which naturally stems from the boundary integral formulation, and compare it to more classical
approaches.

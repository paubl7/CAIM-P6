A non-Hermitian PT-symmetric version of the kicked top is introduced to study the interplay of quantum
chaos with balanced loss and gain. The classical dynamics arising from the quantum dynamics of the
angular momentum expectation values are derived. The presence of PT-symmetry can lead to stable
mixed regular chaotic behaviour without sinks or sources for subcritical values of the gain-loss
parameter. This is an example of what is known in classical dynamical systems as reversible dynamical
systems. For large values of the kicking strength a strange attractor is observed that also persists
if PT-symmetry is broken. The intensity dynamics of the classical map is found to provide the main
structure for the Husimi distributions of the subspaces of the quantum system belonging to certain
ranges of the imaginary parts of the quasienergies. Classical structures are identified in the
quantum dynamics. Finally, the statistics of the eigenvalues of the quantum system are analysed
and it is shown that if most of the eigenvalues are complex (which is the case already for fairly small
non-Hermiticity parameters) the nearest-neighbour distances of the (unfolded) quasienergies
follow a two-dimensional Posisson distribution when the classical dynamics is regular. In the
chaotic regime, they are in line with recently identified universal complex level spacing distributions
for non-Hermitian systems, with transpose symmetry $A^T= A$. It is demonstrated how breaking this
symmetry (by introducing an extra term in the Hamiltonian) recovers the more familiar universality
class for non-Hermitian systems given by the complex Ginibre ensemble. Both universality classes
display cubic level repulsion. The PT-symmetry of the system does not seem to influence the complex
level spacings. Similar behaviour is also observed for the spectrum of a PT-symmetric extension
of the triadic Baker map.

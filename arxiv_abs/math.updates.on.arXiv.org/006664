As the third part of this project, we introduce the homogeneous and piecewise multilinear extensions
and the eigenvalue problem for locally Lipschitz function pairs, which establish further connections
between combinatorics and analysis. Spectral properties for pairs of $p$-homogeneous functions,
and critical point theory on zero-homogeneous functions are proposed. The main contributions
are: (1) We provide several min-max relations between an original discrete formulation and its
piecewise multilinear extension. In virtue of the concept of perfect domain pairs introduced in
this paper, comonotonicity on vectors can be seen as an extension of inclusion chains on sets. The
piecewise multilinear extension is (slice-)rank preserving, which closely relates to Tao's lemma
on diagonal tensors. More discrete-to-continuous equalities are obtained, including a general
form involving log-concave polynomials. And by employing these fundamental correspondences,
we get further results and applications on tensors, Tur\'an's problem, signed (hyper-)graphs,
etc. (2) We derive the mountain pass characterization, linking theorems, nodal domain inequalities,
inertia bounds, duality theorems and distribution of eigenvalues for pairs of $p$-homogeneous
functions. We establish a new property on the subderivative of a convex function which relates to
the Gauss map of the graph of the convex function. Based on these fundamental results, we get more
understanding on the structure of eigenspace. For example, we show a simple one-to-one correspondence
between the nonzero eigenvalues of the vertex $p$-Laplacian and the edge $p^*$-Laplacian. Applications
to Cheeger inequalities and $p$-Laplacians on oriented hypergraphs and simplicial complexes
are presented. Also, the first nonlinear analog of Huang's approach for hypergraphs is provided.

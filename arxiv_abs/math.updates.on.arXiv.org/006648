In this work, we consider a modification of the usual Branching Random Walk (BRW), where we give certain
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) displacements to all the particles at the $n$-th
generation, which may be different from the driving increment distribution. We call this process
last progeny modified branching random walk (LPM-BRW). Depending on the value of a parameter, $\theta$,
we classify the model in three distinct cases, namely, the boundary case, below the boundary case,
and above the boundary case. Under very minimal assumptions on the underlying point process of the
increments, we show that at the boundary case, when $\theta$ takes a particular value $\theta_0$,
the maximum displacement converges to a limit after only an appropriate centering, which is of the
form $c_1 n - c_2 \log n$. We give an explicit formula for the constants $c_1$ and $c_2$ and show that
$c_1$ is exactly the same, while $c_2$ is $1/3$ of the corresponding constants of the usual BRW. We
also characterize the limiting distribution. We further show that below the boundary (that is,
when $\theta < \theta_0$), the logarithmic correction term is absent. For above the boundary case
(that is, when $\theta > \theta_0$), we have only a partial result, which indicates a possible existence
of the logarithmic correction in the centering with exactly the same constant as that of the classical
BRW. For $\theta \leq \theta_0$, we further derive Brunet--Derrida-type results of point process
convergence of our LPM-BRW to a decorated Poisson point process. Our proofs are based on a novel method
of coupling the maximum displacement with a linear statistics associated with a more well-studied
process in statistics, known as the smoothing transformation.

In the applied algebraic topology community, the persistent homology induced by the Vietoris-Rips
simplicial filtration is a standard method for capturing topological information from metric
spaces. In this paper, we consider a different, more geometric way of generating persistent homology
of metric spaces which arises by first embedding a given metric space into a larger space and then
considering thickenings of the original space inside this ambient metric space. In the course of
doing this, we construct an appropriate category for studying this notion of persistent homology
and show that, in a category theoretic sense, the standard persistent homology of the Vietoris-Rips
filtration is isomorphic to our geometric persistent homology provided that the ambient metric
space satisfies a property called injectivity. As an application of this isomorphism result we
are able to precisely characterize the type of intervals that appear in the persistence barcodes
of the Vietoris-Rips filtration of any compact metric space and also to give succinct proofs of the
characterization of the persistent homology of products and metric gluings of metric spaces. Our
results also permit proving several bounds on the length of intervals in the Vietoris-Rips barcode
by other metric invariants. Finally, as another application, we connect this geometric persistent
homology to the notion of filling radius of manifolds introduced by Gromov \cite{G07} and show some
consequences related to (1) the homotopy type of the Vietoris-Rips complexes of spheres which follow
from work of M.~Katz and (2) characterization (rigidity) results for spheres in terms of their Vietoris-Rips
persistence barcodes which follow from work of F.~Wilhelm.

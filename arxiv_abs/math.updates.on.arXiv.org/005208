There is an intrinsic value in higher integration of multi-carrier energy systems to increase operational
flexibility in the electricity system and to improve allocation of resources in gas and electricity
networks, as recently outlined in several contributions. However, the integration of different
energy carrier markets is challenging due to the existence of physical and economic dependencies
between the different energy carriers. We propose an integrated day-ahead multi-carrier gas,
electricity and heat market which includes new types of orders and constraints to represent techno-economic
constraints of conversion and storage technologies. The market contains conversion and storage
orders, and we prove that the proposed market clearing gives rise to competitive equilibria. Besides
a centralised clearing, we propose two decentralised clearing algorithms which differ in how the
decomposition of the underlying centralised clearing optimisation problem is performed, and
hence in sets of involved agents and their information exchange. It is proven that they yield solutions
equivalent to the centralised clearing under mild assumptions. We argue that such an integrated
multi-carrier energy market mitigates market risks faced by market participants and enables better
spot pricing of the different energy carriers. The mitigation of market risks is illustrated by
numerical simulations based on test cases considered in the H2020 Magnitude project. The results
show that conversion/storage technology owners suffer from losses and/or opportunity costs,
if they were obliged to only use elementary orders. For the moderate size test cases considered,
sum of losses and opportunity costs for conversion and storage technologies already reach up to
13,000 EUR/day and 9,000 EUR/day (millions per year), respectively, compared with the case where
only elementary orders are used.

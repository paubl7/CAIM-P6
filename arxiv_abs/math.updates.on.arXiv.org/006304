This study presents a physically consistent displacement-driven reformulation of the concept
of action-at-a-distance, which is at the foundation of nonlocal elasticity. In contrast to existing
approaches that adopts an integral stress-strain constitutive relation, the displacement-driven
approach is predicated on an integral strain-displacement relation. The most remarkable consequence
of this reformulation is that the (total) strain energy is guaranteed to be convex and positive-definite
without imposing any constraint on the symmetry of the kernels. This feature is critical to enable
the application of nonlocal formulations to general continua exhibiting asymmetric interactions;
ultimately a manifestation of material heterogeneity. Remarkably, the proposed approach also
enables a strong satisfaction of the locality recovery condition and of the laws of thermodynamics,
which are not foregone conclusions in most classical nonlocal elasticity theories. Additionally,
the formulation is frame-invariant and the nonlocal operator remains physically consistent at
boundaries. The study is complemented by a detailed analysis of the dynamic response of the nonlocal
continuum and of its intrinsic dispersion leading to the consideration that the choice of nonlocal
kernels should depend on the specific material. Examples of exponential or power-law kernels are
presented in order to demonstrate the applicability of the method to different classes of nonlocal
media. The ability to admit generalized kernels reinforces the generalized nature of the displacement-driven
approach over existing integral methodologies, which typically lead to simplified differential
models based on exponential kernels. The theoretical formulation is also leveraged to simulate
the static response of nonlocal beams and plates illustrating the intrinsic consistency of the
approach, which is free from unwanted boundary effects.

We revisit the problem of operator mixing in massless QCD-like theories. In particular, we address
the problem of determining under which conditions a renormalization scheme exists where the renormalized
mixing matrix in the coordinate representation, $Z(x, \mu)$, is diagonalizable to all perturbative
orders. Our main tool is the geometric interpretation -- perhaps well known but actually fundamental
-- of a (finite) change of renormalization scheme as a (formal) holomorphic gauge transformation,
of $-\frac{\gamma(g)}{\beta(g)}$ as a (formal) meromorphic connection with a Fuchsian singularity
at $g=0$, and of $Z(x, \mu)$ as the associated Wilson line, with $\gamma(g)=\gamma_0 g^2 + \cdots$
the matrix of the anomalous dimensions and $\beta(g)=-\beta_0 g^3 +\cdots$ the beta function.
Our key observation is that the aforementioned geometric interpretation allows us to apply a (formal)
version of the Poincare'-Dulac theorem to the linear system whose solution is $Z(x,\mu)$: If any
two eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \cdots $ of the matrix $\frac{\gamma_0}{\beta_0}$, in
nonincreasing order $\lambda_1 \geq \lambda_2 \geq \cdots$, do not differ by a positive even integer,
i.e., $\lambda_i -\lambda_j -2k \neq 0$ for $i\leq j$ and $k$ a positive integer -- that implies that
the aforementioned linear system is nonresonant according to the Poincare'-Dulac theorem -- then
it exists a renormalization scheme where $\frac{\gamma(g)}{\beta(g)} = \frac{\gamma_0}{\beta_0}
\frac{1}{g}$ is one-loop exact to all perturbative orders. It follows that, if in addition $\frac{\gamma_0}{\beta_0}$
is diagonalizable by a constant gauge transformation, $Z(x, \mu)$ is diagonalizable as well, and
the mixing reduces essentially to the multiplicatively renormalizable case. We also classify
the remaining cases of operator mixing by the Poincare'-Dulac theorem.

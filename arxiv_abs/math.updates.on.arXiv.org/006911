Humanitarian logistics service providers have two major responsibilities immediately after
a disaster: locating trapped people and routing aid to them. These difficult operations are further
hindered by failures in the transportation and telecommunications networks, which are often rendered
unusable by the disaster at hand. In this work, we propose two-echelon vehicle routing frameworks
for performing these operations using aerial uncrewed autonomous vehicles (UAVs or drones) to
address the issues associated with these failures. In our proposed frameworks, we assume that ground
vehicles cannot reach the trapped population directly, but they can only transport drones from
a depot to some intermediate locations. The drones launched from these locations serve to both identify
demands for medical and other aids (e.g., epi-pens, medical supplies, dry food, water) and make
deliveries to satisfy them. Specifically, we present two decision frameworks, in which the resulting
optimization problem is formulated as a two-echelon vehicle routing problem. The first framework
addresses the problem in two stages: providing telecommunications capabilities in the first stage
and satisfying the resulting demands in the second. To that end, two types of drones are considered.
Hotspot drones have the capability of providing cell phone and internet reception, and hence are
used to capture demands. Delivery drones are subsequently employed to satisfy the observed demand.
The second framework, on the other hand, addresses the problem as a stochastic emergency aid delivery
problem, which uses a two-stage robust optimization model to handle demand uncertainty. To solve
the resulting models, we propose efficient and novel solution approaches.

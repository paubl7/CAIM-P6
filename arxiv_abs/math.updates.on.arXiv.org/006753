Up to now, the nonparametric analysis of multidimensional continuous-time Markov processes has
focussed strongly on specific model choices, mostly related to symmetry of the semigroup. While
this approach allows to study the performance of estimators for the characteristics of the process
in the minimax sense, it restricts the applicability of results to a rather constrained set of stochastic
processes and in particular hardly allows incorporating jump structures. As a consequence, for
many models of applied and theoretical interest, no statement can be made about the robustness of
typical statistical procedures beyond the beautiful, but limited framework available in the literature.
To close this gap, we identify $\beta$-mixing of the process and heat kernel bounds on the transition
density as a suitable combination to obtain $\sup$-norm and $L^2$ kernel invariant density estimation
rates matching the case of reversible multidimenisonal diffusion processes and outperforming
density estimation based on discrete i.i.d. or weakly dependent data. Moreover, we demonstrate
how up to $\log$-terms, optimal $\sup$-norm adaptive invariant density estimation can be achieved
within our general framework based on tight uniform moment bounds and deviation inequalities for
empirical processes associated to additive functionals of Markov processes. The underlying assumptions
are verifiable with classical tools from stability theory of continuous time Markov processes
and PDE techniques, which opens the door to evaluate statistical performance for a vast amount of
Markov models. We highlight this point by showing how multidimensional jump SDEs with L\'evy driven
jump part under different coefficient assumptions can be seamlessly integrated into our framework,
thus establishing novel adaptive $\sup$-norm estimation rates for this class of processes.

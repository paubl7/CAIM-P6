Let $\mathscr{C}_n=\{-1,1\}^n$ be the discrete hypercube equipped with the uniform probability
measure $\sigma_n$. Talagrand's influence inequality (1994) asserts that there exists $C\in(0,\infty)$
such that for every $n\in\mathbb{N}$, every function $f:\mathscr{C}_n\to\mathbb{C}$ satisfies
$$\mathrm{Var}_{\sigma_n}(f) \leq C \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{\|\partial_if\|_{L_2(\sigma_n)}^2}{1+\log\big(\|\partial_if\|_{L_2(\sigma_n)}/\|\partial_i
f\|_{L_1(\sigma_n)}\big)}.$$ In this work, we undertake a systematic investigation of this and
related inequalities via harmonic analytic and stochastic techniques. We prove that Talagrand's
inequality extends, up to an additional doubly logarithmic factor, to Banach space-valued functions
under the necessary assumption that the target space has Rademacher type 2 and that this doubly logarithmic
term can be omitted if the target space admits an equivalent 2-uniformly smooth norm. These are the
first vector-valued extensions of Talagrand's influence inequality. We also obtain a joint strengthening
of results of Bakry-Meyer (1982) and Naor-Schechtman (2002) on the action of negative powers of
the hypercube Laplacian on functions $f:\mathscr{C}_n\to E$, whose target space $E$ has nontrivial
Rademacher type via a new vector-valued version of Meyer's multiplier theorem (1984). Inspired
by Talagrand's influence inequality, we introduce a new metric invariant called Talagrand type
and estimate it for Banach spaces with prescribed Rademacher or martingale type, Gromov hyperbolic
groups and simply connected Riemannian manifolds of pinched negative curvature. Finally, we prove
that Talagrand type is an obstruction to the bi-Lipschitz embeddability of nonlinear quotients
of the hypercube $\mathscr{C}_n$, thus deriving new nonembeddability results for these finite
metrics.

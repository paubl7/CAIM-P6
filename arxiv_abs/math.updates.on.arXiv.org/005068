In this article the author continues his investigation of the M\"obius-invariant Willmore flow,
for which the author has already proved existence and uniqueness of smooth short-time solutions,
starting in arbitrary smooth initial immersions $F_0$ which map some fixed compact torus $\Sigma$
into $\mathbb{R}^n$ respectively $\mathbb{S}^n$ without any umbilic points. Here, we prove that
this flow exists globally, in particular does not develop singularities, and subconverges to smooth
Willmore-Hopf-tori in every $C^{m}-$norm, if the initial immersion $F_0$ maps some fixed smooth
compact torus $\Sigma$ onto a "Hopf-torus" in $\mathbb{S}^3$. Moreover, if in addition the Willmore-energy
of the initial immersion $F_0$ is required to be smaller than the threshold $8 \, \sqrt{\frac{\pi^3}{3}}$,
then the unique flow line of the M\"obius invariant Willmore flow, starting to move in $F_0$, fully
converges to some conformal image of the standard Clifford-torus in every $C^{m}-$norm, up to time
dependent, smooth reparametrizations. Key instruments for the proofs are the equivariance of
the Hopf-fibration $\pi:\mathbb{S}^3 \to \mathbb{S}^2$ w.r.t. the effect of the first variation
of the Willmore energy applied to smooth Hopf-tori in $\mathbb{S}^3$ and to smooth closed regular
curves in $\mathbb{S}^2$, the application of the Lojasiewicz-Simon gradient inequality, in the
spirit of Leon Simon, respectively Chill, Fasanova and Sch\"atzle, some general maximal regularity
result for linear inhomogeneous parabolic boundary value problems due to Denk, Hieber and Pr\"uss,
and a certain mathematical bridge between the Euler-Lagrange equation of the elastic energy functional
and a particular class of elliptic curves over $\mathbb{C}$.

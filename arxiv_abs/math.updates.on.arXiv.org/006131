The Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (CHNS) equations represent the fundamental building blocks
of hydrodynamic phase-field models for multiphase fluid flow dynamics. Due to the coupling between
the Navier-Stokes equation and the Cahn-Hilliard equation, the CHNS system is non-trivial to solve
numerically. Traditionally, a numerical extrapolation for the coupling terms is used. However,
such brute-force extrapolation usually destroys the intrinsic thermodynamic structures of this
CHNS system. This paper proposes a new strategy to reformulate the CHNS system into a constraint
gradient flow formation. Under the new formulation, the reversible and irreversible structures
are clearly revealed. This guides us to propose operator splitting schemes. The operator splitting
schemes have several advantageous properties. First of all, the proposed schemes lead to several
decoupled systems in smaller sizes to be solved at each time marching step. This significantly reduces
computational costs. Secondly, the proposed schemes still guarantee the thermodynamic laws of
the CHNS system at the discrete level. It ensures the thermodynamic laws, accuracy, and stability
for the numerical solutions. In addition, unlike the recently populated IEQ or SAV approach using
auxiliary variables, our resulting energy laws are formulated in the original variables. Our proposed
framework lays out a foundation to design decoupled and energy stable numerical algorithms for
hydrodynamic phase-field models. Furthermore, given different splitting steps, various numerical
algorithms can be obtained, making this framework rather general. The proposed numerical algorithms
are implemented. Their second-order accuracy in time is verified numerically. Some numerical
examples and benchmark problems are calculated to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

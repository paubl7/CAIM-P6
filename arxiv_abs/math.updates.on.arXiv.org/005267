In this work, we present a pipeline for characterization of bladder surface dynamics during deep
respiratory movements from dynamic Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Dynamic MRI may capture
temporal anatomical changes in soft tissue organs with high-contrast but the obtained sequences
usually suffer from limited volume coverage which makes the high resolution reconstruction of
organ shape trajectories a major challenge in temporal studies. For a compact shape representation,
the reconstructed temporal data with full volume coverage are first used to establish a subject-specific
dynamical 4D mesh sequences using the large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping (LDDMM)
framework. Then, we performed a statistical characterization of organ shape changes from mechanical
parameters such as mesh elongations and distortions. Since shape space is curved, we have also used
the intrinsic curvature changes as metric to quantify surface evolution. However, the numerical
computation of curvature is strongly dependant on the surface parameterization (i.e. the mesh
resolution). To cope with this dependency, we propose a non-parametric level set method to evaluate
spatio-temporal surface evolution. Independent of parameterization and minimizing the length
of the geodesic curves, it shrinks smoothly the surface curves towards a sphere by minimizing a Dirichlet
energy. An Eulerian PDE approach is used for evaluation of surface dynamics from the curve-shortening
flow. Results demonstrate the numerical stability of the derived descriptor throughout smooth
continuous-time organ trajectories. Intercorrelations between individuals' motion patterns
from different geometric features are computed using the Laplace-Beltrami Operator (LBO) eigenfunctions
for spherical mapping.

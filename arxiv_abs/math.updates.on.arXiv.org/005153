Attitudinal Network Graphs (ANG) are network graphs where edges capture an expressed opinion:
two vertices connected by an edge can be agreeable (positive) or antagonistic (negative). Measure
of consensus in attitudinal graph reflects how easy or difficult consensus can be reached that is
acceptable by everyone. Frustration index is one such measure as it determines the distance of a
network from a state of total structural balance. In this paper, we propose to measure the consensus
in the graph by expanding the notion of frustration index to a frustration cloud, a collection of
nearest balanced states for a given network. The frustration cloud resolves the consensus problem
with minimal sentiment disruption, taking all possible consensus views over the entire network
into consideration. A frustration cloud based approach removes the brittleness of traditional
network graph analysis, as it allows one to examine the consensus on entire graph. A spanning-tree-based
balancing algorithm captures the variations of balanced states and global consensus of the network,
and enables us to measure vertex influence on consensus and strength of its expressed attitudes.
The proposed algorithm provides a parsimonious account of the differences between strong and weak
statuses and influences of a vertex in a large network, as demonstrated on sample attitudinal network
graphs constructed from social and survey data. We show that the proposed method accurately models
the alliance network, provides discriminant features for community discovery, successfully
predicts administrator election outcome consistent with real election outcomes, and provides
deeper analytic insights into ANG outcome analysis by pinpointing influential vertices and anomalous
decisions.

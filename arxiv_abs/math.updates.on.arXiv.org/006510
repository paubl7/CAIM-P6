This paper is concerned with the sensitivity analysis of a class of parameterized fixed-point problems
that arise in the context of obstacle-type quasi-variational inequalities. We prove that, if the
operators in the considered fixed-point equation satisfy a positive superhomogeneity condition,
then the maximal and minimal element of the solution set of the problem depend locally Lipschitz
continuously on the involved parameters. We further show that, if certain concavity conditions
hold, then the maximal solution mapping is Hadamard directionally differentiable and its directional
derivatives are precisely the minimal solutions of suitably defined linearized fixed-point equations.
In contrast to prior results, our analysis requires neither a Dirichlet space structure, nor restrictive
assumptions on the mapping behavior and regularity of the involved operators, nor sign conditions
on the directions that are considered in the directional derivatives. Our approach further covers
the elliptic and parabolic setting simultaneously and also yields Hadamard directional differentiability
results in situations in which the solution set of the fixed-point equation is a continuum and a characterization
of directional derivatives via linearized auxiliary problems is provably impossible. To illustrate
that our results can be used to study interesting problems arising in practice, we apply them to establish
the Hadamard directional differentiability of the solution operator of a nonlinear elliptic quasi-variational
inequality, which emerges in impulse control and in which the obstacle mapping is obtained by taking
essential infima over certain parts of the underlying domain, and of the solution mapping of a parabolic
quasi-variational inequality, which involves boundary controls and in which the state-to-obstacle
relationship is described by a partial differential equation.

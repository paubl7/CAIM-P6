Given an integer $n\geq 1$ and an irreducible character $\chi_{\lambda}$ of $S_{n}$ for some partition
$\lambda$ of $n$, the immanant $\mathrm{imm}_{\lambda}:\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}\to\mathbb{C}$
maps matrices $A\in\mathbb{C}^{n\times n}$ to $\mathrm{imm}_{\lambda}(A)=\sum_{\pi\in S_{n}}\chi_{\lambda}(\pi)\prod_{i=1}^{n}A_{i,\pi(i)}$.
Important special cases include the determinant and permanent, which are the immanants associated
with the sign and trivial character, respectively. It is known that immanants can be evaluated in
polynomial time for characters that are close to the sign character: Given a partition $\lambda$
of $n$ with $s$ parts, let $b(\lambda):=n-s$ count the boxes to the right of the first column in the
Young diagram of $\lambda$. For a family of partitions $\Lambda$, let $b(\Lambda):=\max_{\lambda\in\Lambda}b(\lambda)$
and write Imm$(\Lambda)$ for the problem of evaluating $\mathrm{imm}_{\lambda}(A)$ on input
$A$ and $\lambda\in\Lambda$. If $b(\Lambda)<\infty$, then Imm$(\Lambda)$ is known to be polynomial-time
computable. This subsumes the case of the determinant. On the other hand, if $b(\Lambda)=\infty$,
then previously known hardness results suggest that Imm$(\Lambda)$ cannot be solved in polynomial
time. However, these results only address certain restricted classes of families $\Lambda$. In
this paper, we show that the parameterized complexity assumption FPT $\neq$ #W[1] rules out polynomial-time
algorithms for Imm$(\Lambda)$ for any computationally reasonable family of partitions $\Lambda$
with $b(\Lambda)=\infty$. We give an analogous result in algebraic complexity under the assumption
VFPT $\neq$ VW[1]. Furthermore, if $b(\lambda)$ even grows polynomially in $\Lambda$, we show
that Imm$(\Lambda)$ is hard for #P and VNP. This concludes a series of partial results on the complexity
of immanants obtained over the last 35 years.

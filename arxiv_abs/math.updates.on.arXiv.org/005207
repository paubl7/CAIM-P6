We provide a primer to numerical methods based on Taylor series expansions such as generalized finite
difference methods and collocation methods. We provide a detailed benchmarking strategy for these
methods as well as all data files including input files, boundary conditions, point distribution
and solution fields, so as to facilitate future benchmarking of new methods. We review traditional
methods and recent ones which appeared in the last decade. We aim to help newcomers to the field understand
the main characteristics of these methods and to provide sufficient information to both simplify
implementation and benchmarking of new methods. Some of the examples are chosen within a subset
of problems where collocation is traditionally known to perform sub-par, namely when the solution
sought is non-smooth, i.e. contains discontinuities, singularities or sharp gradients. For such
problems and other simpler ones with smooth solutions, we study in depth the influence of the weight
function, correction function, and the number of nodes in a given support. We also propose new stabilization
approaches to improve the accuracy of the numerical methods. In particular, we experiment with
the use of a Voronoi diagram for weight computation, collocation method stabilization approaches,
and support node selection for problems with singular solutions. With an appropriate selection
of the above-mentioned parameters, the resulting collocation methods are compared to the moving
least-squares method (and variations thereof), the radial basis function finite difference method
and the finite element method. Extensive tests involving two and three dimensional problems indicate
that the methods perform well in terms of efficiency (accuracy versus computational time), even
for non-smooth solutions.

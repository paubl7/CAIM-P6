This paper considers the multiaccess coded caching systems formulated by Hachem et al., including
a central server containing $N$ files connected to $K$ cache-less users through an error-free shared
link, and $K$ cache-nodes, each equipped with a cache memory size of $M$ files. Each user has access
to $L$ neighbouring cache-nodes with a cyclic wrap-around topology. The coded caching scheme proposed
by Hachem et al. suffers from the case that $L$ does not divide $K$, where the needed number of transmissions
(a.k.a. load) is at most four times the load expression for the case where $L$ divides $K$. Our main
contribution is to propose a novel {\it transformation} approach to smartly extend the schemes
satisfying some conditions for the well known shared-link caching systems to the multiaccess caching
systems. Then we can get many coded caching schemes with different subpacketizations for multiaccess
coded caching system. These resulting schemes have the maximum local caching gain (i.e., the cached
contents stored at any $L$ neighbouring cache-nodes are different such that the number of retrieval
packets by each user from the connected cache-nodes is maximal) and the same coded caching gain as
the original schemes. Applying the transformation approach to the well-known shared-link coded
caching scheme proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen, we obtain a new multiaccess coded caching scheme
that achieves the same load as the scheme of Hachem et al. but for any system parameters. Under the
constraint of the cache placement used in this new multiaccess coded caching scheme, our delivery
strategy is approximately optimal when $K$ is sufficiently large. Finally, we also show that the
transmission load of the proposed scheme can be further reduced by compressing the multicast message.

We study a specialization of the problem of broadcasting on directed acyclic graphs, namely, broadcasting
on 2D regular grids. Consider a 2D regular grid with source vertex $X$ at layer $0$ and $k+1$ vertices
at layer $k\geq 1$, which are at distance $k$ from $X$. Every vertex of the 2D regular grid has outdegree
$2$, the vertices at the boundary have indegree $1$, and all other vertices have indegree $2$. At
time $0$, $X$ is given a random bit. At time $k\geq 1$, each vertex in layer $k$ receives transmitted
bits from its parents in layer $k-1$, where the bits pass through binary symmetric channels with
noise level $\delta\in(0,1/2)$. Then, each vertex combines its received bits using a common Boolean
processing function to produce an output bit. The objective is to recover $X$ with probability of
error better than $1/2$ from all vertices at layer $k$ as $k \rightarrow \infty$. Besides their natural
interpretation in communication networks, such broadcasting processes can be construed as 1D
probabilistic cellular automata (PCA) with boundary conditions that limit the number of sites
at each time $k$ to $k+1$. We conjecture that it is impossible to propagate information in a 2D regular
grid regardless of the noise level and the choice of processing function. In this paper, we make progress
towards establishing this conjecture, and prove using ideas from percolation and coding theory
that recovery of $X$ is impossible for any $\delta$ provided that all vertices use either AND or XOR
processing functions. Furthermore, we propose a martingale-based approach that establishes
the impossibility of recovering $X$ for any $\delta$ when all NAND processing functions are used
if certain supermartingales can be rigorously constructed. We also provide numerical evidence
for the existence of these supermartingales by computing explicit examples for different values
of $\delta$ via linear programming.

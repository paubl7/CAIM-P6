Due to structural and functional abnormalities or genetic variations and mutations, there may
be dysfunctional molecules within an intracellular signaling network that do not allow the network
to correctly regulate its output molecules, such as transcription factors. This disruption in
signaling interrupts normal cellular functions and may eventually develop some pathological
conditions. In this paper, computation capacity of signaling networks is introduced as a fundamental
limit on signaling capability and performance of such networks. The computation capacity measures
the maximum number of computable inputs, that is, the maximum number of input values for which the
correct functional output values can be recovered from the erroneous network outputs, when the
network contains some dysfunctional molecules. This contrasts with the conventional communication
capacity that measures instead the maximum number of input values that can be correctly distinguished
based on the erroneous network outputs. The computation capacity is higher than the communication
capacity, if the network response function is not a one-to-one function of the input signals. By
explicitly incorporating the effect of signaling errors that result in the network dysfunction,
the computation capacity provides more information about the network and its malfunction. Two
examples of signaling networks are studied here, one regulating caspase3 and another regulating
NFkB, for which computation and communication capacities are analyzed. Higher computation capacities
are observed for both networks. One biological implication of this finding is that signaling networks
may have more capacity than that specified by the conventional communication capacity metric.
The effect of feedback is also studied. In summary, this paper reports findings on a new fundamental
feature of the signaling capability of cell signaling networks.

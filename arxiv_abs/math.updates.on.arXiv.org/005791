Meshfree discretizations of state-based peridynamic models are attractive due to their ability
to naturally describe fracture of general materials. However, two factors conspire to prevent
meshfree discretizations of state-based peridynamics from converging to corresponding local
solutions as resolution is increased: quadrature error prevents an accurate prediction of bulk
mechanics, and the lack of an explicit boundary representation presents challenges when applying
traction loads. In this paper, we develop a reformulation of the linear peridynamic solid (LPS)
model to address these shortcomings, using improved meshfree quadrature, a reformulation of the
nonlocal dilitation, and a consistent handling of the nonlocal traction condition to construct
a model with rigorous accuracy guarantees. In particular, these improvements are designed to enforce
discrete consistency in the presence of evolving fractures, whose {\it a priori} unknown location
render consistent treatment difficult. In the absence of fracture, when a corresponding classical
continuum mechanics model exists, our improvements provide asymptotically compatible convergence
to corresponding local solutions, eliminating surface effects and issues with traction loading
which have historically plagued peridynamic discretizations. When fracture occurs, our formulation
automatically provides a sharp representation of the fracture surface by breaking bonds, avoiding
the loss of mass. We provide rigorous error analysis and demonstrate convergence for a number of
benchmarks, including manufactured solutions, free-surface, nonhomogeneous traction loading,
and composite material problems. Finally, we validate simulations of brittle fracture against
a recent experiment of dynamic crack branching in soda-lime glass, providing evidence that the
scheme yields accurate predictions for practical engineering problems.

This paper investigates a machine learning-based power allocation design for secure transmission
in a cognitive radio (CR) network. In particular, a neural network (NN)-based approach is proposed
to maximize the secrecy rate of the secondary receiver under the constraints of total transmit power
of secondary transmitter, and the interference leakage to the primary receiver, within which three
different regularization schemes are developed. The key advantage of the proposed algorithm over
conventional approaches is the capability to solve the power allocation problem with both perfect
and imperfect channel state information. In a conventional setting, two completely different
optimization frameworks have to be designed, namely the robust and non-robust designs. Furthermore,
conventional algorithms are often based on iterative techniques, and hence, they require a considerable
number of iterations, rendering them less suitable in future wireless networks where there are
very stringent delay constraints. To meet the unprecedented requirements of future ultra-reliable
low-latency networks, we propose an NN-based approach that can determine the power allocation
in a CR network with significantly reduced computational time and complexity. As this trained NN
only requires a small number of linear operations to yield the required power allocations, the approach
can also be extended to different delay sensitive applications and services in future wireless
networks. When evaluate the proposed method versus conventional approaches, using a suitable
test set, the proposed approach can achieve more than 94% of the secrecy rate performance with less
than 1% computation time and more than 93% satisfaction of interference leakage constraints. These
results are obtained with significant reduction in computational time, which we believe that it
is suitable for future real-time wireless applications.

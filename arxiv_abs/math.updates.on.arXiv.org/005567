A new proof for the embedded resolution of surface singularities in a three-dimensional smooth
ambient space over algebraically closed fields of arbitrary characteristic. The proof makes use
of an upper semicontinuous resolution invariant which prescribes the center in each step of the
resolution algorithm. The resolution invariant strictly decreases under each blowup. The definition
of the resolution invariant is inspired by the proofs of resolution of singularities in arbitrary
dimension over fields of characteristic zero. It was developed in an attempt to generalize these
proofs to the setting of arbitrary characteristic. The usual resolution invariant which is used
in characteristic zero behaves very badly over fields of positive characteristic. It is not upper
semicontinuous. Further, the invariant may increase under blowup which destroys the induction
argument. It is shown how these problems can be overcome in the case of surface singularities which
are embedded in a three-dimensional smooth ambient space. Analogous to the proofs of resolution
of singularities in characteristic zero, coefficient ideals are used to enable induction on the
dimension of the ambient space. Since hypersurfaces of maximal contact need not exist over fields
of positive characteristic, coefficient ideals are considered instead with respect to all regular
hypersurfaces. The associated invariants are then maximized over all local flags of smooth subspaces.
To construct flags which realize this maximum, techniques are introduced to maximize invariants
of coefficient ideals over all coordinate changes. These so-called "cleaning techniques" form
a core part of the proof. They can be seen as a characteristic-free generalization of the Tschirnhausen
transformation, a classical technique to construct hypersurfaces of maximal contact.

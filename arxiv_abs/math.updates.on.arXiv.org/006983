In this article, we discuss the stability of (restricted) Chebyshev centres in few function spaces,
namely, vector-valued continuous, bounded and Bochner integrable function spaces. For an extremally
disconnected compact Hausdorff space $K$ and a finite dimensional Banach space $X$, we prove the
existence of a Chebyshev centre of closed bounded subsets of $C(K,X)$, the space of $X$-valued continuous
functions on $K$ and that of compact subsets of $M$-ideals in $C(K,X)$. It is also proved that the
existence of restricted Chebyshev centres is stable in the space of all vector-valued bounded functions
on an arbitrary set. For a compact Hausdorff space $K$, an explicit description of the Chebyshev
centres in the $M$-summands in the space of real-valued continuous functions on a compact Hausdorff
space is provided. For a closed subspace $Y$ of a Banach space $X$, we also investigate the stability
of restricted Chebyshev centres of certain closed bounded subsets of the space of $X$-valued Bochner
$p$-integrable functions, $L_{p}(\mu,X)$, in $L_{p}(\mu,Y)$ in the following cases: $(i).$
a probability separable measure space $(\varOmega, \varSigma, \mu)$ such that $\varSigma$ contains
the singletons of $\varOmega$ and $1 \leq p <\infty$ and $(ii).$ a finite measure space $(\varOmega,
\varSigma, \mu)$; $Y$ satisfying property $(HV)$ in $X$, which was introduced in [W. A. Light, Proximinality
in $L_{p}(S, Y)$, Rocky Mountain Journal of Mathematics, Vol. $19$ ($1989$), $251\mbox{--}259$]
and $1 \leq p \leq \infty$. The stability of continuity properties of the (restricted) Chebyshev-centre
map of a Banach space $X$ in dependence on the continuity properties of the Chebyshev-centre map
of $C(K,X)$ or $L_{p}(\mu,X)$($1\leq p <\infty$) and vice versa is also discussed.

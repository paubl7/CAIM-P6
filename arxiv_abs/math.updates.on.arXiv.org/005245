Conservation laws are considered to be fundamental laws of nature. It has broad applications in
many fields, including physics, chemistry, biology, geology, and engineering. Solving the differential
equations associated with conservation laws is a major branch in computational mathematics. The
recent success of machine learning, especially deep learning in areas such as computer vision and
natural language processing, has attracted a lot of attention from the community of computational
mathematics and inspired many intriguing works in combining machine learning with traditional
methods. In this paper, we are the first to view numerical PDE solvers as an MDP and to use (deep) RL
to learn new solvers. As proof of concept, we focus on 1-dimensional scalar conservation laws. We
deploy the machinery of deep reinforcement learning to train a policy network that can decide on
how the numerical solutions should be approximated in a sequential and spatial-temporal adaptive
manner. We will show that the problem of solving conservation laws can be naturally viewed as a sequential
decision-making process, and the numerical schemes learned in such a way can easily enforce long-term
accuracy. Furthermore, the learned policy network is carefully designed to determine a good local
discrete approximation based on the current state of the solution, which essentially makes the
proposed method a meta-learning approach. In other words, the proposed method is capable of learning
how to discretize for a given situation mimicking human experts. Finally, we will provide details
on how the policy network is trained, how well it performs compared with some state-of-the-art numerical
solvers such as WENO schemes, and supervised learning based approach L3D and PINN, and how well it
generalizes.

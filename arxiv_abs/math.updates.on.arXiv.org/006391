Quantum self-testing is the task of certifying quantum states and measurements using the output
statistics solely, with minimal assumptions about the underlying quantum system. It is based on
the observation that some extremal points in the set of quantum correlations can only be achieved,
up to isometries, with specific states and measurements. Here, we present a new approach for quantum
self-testing in Bell non-locality scenarios, motivated by the following observation: the quantum
maximum of a given Bell inequality is, in general, difficult to characterize. However, it is strictly
contained in an easy-to-characterize set: the \emph{theta body} of a vertex-weighted induced
subgraph $(G,w)$ of the graph in which vertices represent the events and edges join mutually exclusive
events. This implies that, for the cases where the quantum maximum and the maximum within the theta
body (known as the Lov\'asz theta number) of $(G,w)$ coincide, self-testing can be demonstrated
by just proving self-testability with the theta body of $G$. This graph-theoretic framework allows
us to (i) recover the self-testability of several quantum correlations that are known to permit
self-testing (like those violating the Clauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt (CHSH) and three-party Mermin
Bell inequalities for projective measurements of arbitrary rank, and chained Bell inequalities
for rank-one projective measurements), (ii) prove the self-testability of quantum correlations
that were not known using existing self-testing techniques (e.g., those violating the Abner Shimony
Bell inequality for rank-one projective measurements). Additionally, the analysis of the chained
Bell inequalities gives us a closed-form expression of the Lov\'asz theta number for a family of
well-studied graphs known as the M\"obius ladders, which might be of independent interest in the
community of discrete mathematics.

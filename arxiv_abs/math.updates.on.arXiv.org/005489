This paper studies the structure and stability of boundaries in noncollapsed $\text{RCD}(K,N)$
spaces, that is, metric-measure spaces $(X,\mathsf{d},\mathscr{H}^N)$ with lower Ricci curvature
bounded below. Our main structural result is that the boundary $\partial X$ is homeomorphic to a
manifold away from a set of codimension 2, and is $N-1$ rectifiable. Along the way we show effective
measure bounds on the boundary and its tubular neighborhoods. These results are new even for Gromov-Hausdorff
limits $(M_i^N,\mathsf{d}_{g_i},p_i) \rightarrow (X,\mathsf{d},p)$ of smooth manifolds with
boundary, and require new techniques beyond those needed to prove the analogous statements for
the regular set, in particular when it comes to the manifold structure of the boundary $\partial
X$. The key local result is an $\epsilon$-regularity theorem, which tells us that if a ball $B_{2}(p)\subset
X$ is sufficiently close to a half space $B_{2}(0)\subset \mathbb{R}^N_+$ in the Gromov-Hausdorff
sense, then $B_1(p)$ is biH\"older to an open set of $\mathbb{R}^N_+$. In particular, $\partial
X$ is itself homeomorphic to $B_1(0^{N-1})$ near $B_1(p)$. Further, the boundary $\partial X$
is $N-1$ rectifiable and the boundary measure $\mathscr{H}^{N-1}_{\partial X}$ is Ahlfors regular
on $B_1(p)$ with volume close to the Euclidean volume. Our second collection of results involve
the stability of the boundary with respect to noncollapsed mGH convergence $X_i\to X$. Specifically,
we show a boundary volume convergence which tells us that the $N-1$ Hausdorff measures on the boundaries
converge $\mathscr{H}^{N-1}_{\partial X_i}\to \mathscr{H}^{N-1}_{\partial X}$ to the limit
Hausdorff measure on $\partial X$. We will see that a consequence of this is that if the $X_i$ are boundary
free then so is $X$.

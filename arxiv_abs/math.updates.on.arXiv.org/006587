There are many formulas that express interesting properties of a finite group G in terms of sums over
its characters. For estimating these sums, one of the most salient quantities to understand is the
character ratio trace(\pi(g)) / dim(\pi), for an irreducible representation \pi of G and an element
g of G. It turns out [Gurevich-Howe15, Gurevich-Howe17] that for classical groups G over finite
fields there are several (compatible) invariants of representations that provide strong information
on the character ratios. We call these invariants collectively rank. Rank suggests a new way to organize
the representations of classical groups over finite and local fields - a way in which the building
blocks are the "smallest" representations. This is in contrast to Harish-Chandra's philosophy
of cusp forms that is the main organizational principle since the 60s, and in it the building blocks
are the cuspidal representations which are, in some sense, the "LARGEST". The philosophy of cusp
forms is well adapted to establishing the Plancherel formula for reductive groups over local fields,
and led to Lusztig's classification of the irreducible representations of such groups over finite
fields. However, analysis of character ratios might benefit from a different approach. In this
note we discuss further the notion of tensor rank for GL_n over a finite field F_q and demonstrate
how to get information on representations of a given tensor rank using tools coming from the recently
studied eta correspondence, as well as the well known philosophy of cusp forms, mentioned just above.
A significant discovery so far is that although the dimensions of the irreducible representations
of a given tensor rank vary by quite a lot (they can differ by large powers of q), for certain group elements
of interest the character ratios of these irreps are nearly equal to each other.

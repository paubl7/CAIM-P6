We study here, from the Gromov-Witten theory point of view, some aspects of rigidity of locally conformally
symplectic manifolds, or $\lcs$ manifolds for short, which are a natural generalization of both
contact and symplectic manifolds. In particular, we give a first known analogue of the classical
Gromov non-squeezing in lcs geometry. Another possible version of non-squeezing related to contact
non-squeezing is also discussed. In a different direction we study Gromov-Witten theory of the
$\lcs$ manifold $C \times S ^{1} $ induced by a contact form $\lambda$ on $C$, and show that the extended
Gromov-Witten invariant counting certain charged elliptic curves in $C \times S ^{1} $ is identified
with the extended classical Fuller index of the Reeb vector field $R ^{\lambda} $, by extended we
mean that these invariants can be $\pm \infty$-valued. Partly inspired by this, we conjecture existence
of certain 1-d curves we call Reeb curves in certain $\lcs$ manifolds, which we call conformal symplectic
Weinstein conjecture, and this is a direct extension of the classical Weinstein conjecture. Also
using Gromov-Witten theory, we show that the CSW conjecture holds for a $C ^{3} $- neighborhood of
the induced lcs form on $C \times S ^{1} $, for $C$ a contact manifold with contact form whose Reeb flow
has non-zero extended Fuller index, e.g. $S ^{2k+1} $ with standard contact form, for which this
index is $\pm \infty$. We also show that in some cases the failure of this conjecture implies existence
of sky catastrophes for families of holomorphic curves in a $\lcs$ manifold. No examples of the latter
phenomenon are known to exist, even in the un-tamed almost complex world, this phenomenon if it exists,
would be analogous to sky catastrophes in dynamical systems discovered by Fuller.

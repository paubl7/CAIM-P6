Let us consider the prime field of two elements, $\mathbb F_2.$ The "hit" problem for a module over
the mod 2 Steenrod algebra $\mathscr A$ is an interesting and important open problem of Algebraic
topology, which asks a minimal set of generators for the polynomial algebra $\mathcal P_m:=\mathbb
F_2[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m]$ regarded as a connected unstable $\mathscr A$-module on $m$ variables
$x_1, \ldots, x_m,$ each of degree one. The algebra $\mathcal P_m$ is the $\mathbb F_2$-cohomology
of the product of $m$ copies of the Eilenberg-MacLan complex $K(\mathbb F_2, 1).$ This problem has
been thoroughly studied for 35 years in a variety of contexts, but solving it remains a mystery for
$m\geq 5.$ The aim of this work is of studying the hit problem of five variables. An efficient approach
to solve the problem had been given. More precisely, we develop our work on the hit problem for $\mathscr
A$-module $\mathcal P_5$ in the "generic" degree $n_t:=5(2^t-1) + 18.2^t$ for any non-negative
integer $t.$ Moreover, we provide an algorithm in MAGMA for verifying the results and studying the
hit problem in general. Our result confirms Sum's conjecture for the relation between the minimal
sets of $\mathscr A$-generators of the polynomial algebras $\mathcal P_{m-1}$ and $\mathcal P_{m}$
in the case $m=5$ and degree $n_t.$ Two applications of this study are to determine the dimension
of $\mathcal P_6$ in the generic degree $5(2^{t+4}-1) + n_1.2^{t+4}$ for all $t > 0$ and modular representation
of the general linear group of rank 5 over $\mathbb F_2.$ As a corollary, we show that the Singer cohomological
"transfer" is an isomorphism at the bidegree $(5, 5+n_0).$ Singer's algebraic transfer of rank
$m$ is one of the relatively efficient tools for describing the structure of the cohomology of the
Steenrod algebra.

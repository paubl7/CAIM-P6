We give a constructive proof, to all orders, that each member of the non-commutative potential Korteweg-de
Vries hierarchy is a Fredholm Grassmannian flow and is therefore linearisable. Indeed we prove
this for any linear combination of fields from this hierarchy. That each member of the hierarchy
is linearisable, and integrable in this sense, means that the time evolving solution can be generated
from the solution to the corresponding linear dispersion equation in the hierarchy, combined with
solving an associated linear Fredholm equation representing the Marchenko equation. Further,
we show that within the class of polynomial partial differential fields, at every order, each member
of the non-commutative potential Korteweg--de Vries hierarchy is unique. Indeed, we prove to all
orders, that each such member matches the non-commutative Lax hierarchy field, which is therefore
a polynomial partial differential field. We achieve this by constructing the abstract combinatorial
algebra that underlies the non-commutative potential Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy. This algebra
is the non-commutative polynomial algebra over the real line generated by the set of all compositions
endowed with the Poppe product. This product is the abstract representation of the product rule
for Hankel operators pioneered by Ch. Poppe for integrable equations such as the Sine-Gordon and
Korteweg-de Vries equations. Integrability of the hierarchy members translates, in the combinatorial
algebra, to proving the existence of a `Poppe polynomial' expansion for basic compositions in terms
of `linear signature expansions'. Proving the existence of such Poppe polynomial expansions boils
down to solving a linear algebraic problem for the expansion coefficients, which we solve constructively
to all orders.

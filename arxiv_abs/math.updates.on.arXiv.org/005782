Let f(1)=2, f(2)=4, and let f(n+1)=f(n)! for every integer n \geq 2. Edmund Landau's conjecture
states that the set P(n^2+1) of primes of the form n^2+1 is infinite. Landau's conjecture implies
the following unproven statement \Phi: card(P(n^2+1))< \omega => P(n^2+1) \subseteq [2,f(7)].
Let B denote the system of equations: {x_i!=x_k: i,k \in {1,...,9}} \cup {x_i \cdot x_j=x_k: i,j,k
\in {1,...,9}}. We write down a system U \subseteq B of 9 equations which has exactly two solutions
in positive integers: (1,...,1) and (f(1),...,f(9)). Let \Psi denote the statement: if a system
S \subseteq B has at most finitely many solutions in positive integers x_1,...,x_9, then each such
solution (x_1,...,x_9) satisfies x_1,...,x_9 \leq f(9). We write down a system A \subseteq B of
8 equations. The statement \Psi restricted to the system A is equivalent to the statement \Phi. It
heuristically proves the statement \Phi. Conditions (1)-(5) concern sets X \subseteq N. *** (1)
There are many elements of X and it is conjectured that X is infinite. (2) No known algorithm with no
input returns the logical value of the statement card(X)=\omega. (3) There is a known algorithm
that for every k \in N decides whether or not k \in X. (4) There is a known algorithm with no input that
computes an integer n satisfying card(X)<\omega => X \subseteq [0,n]. (5) There is a known condition
C, which can be formalized in ZFC, such that for all except at most finitely many k \in N, k satisfies
the condition C if and only if k \in X. The simplest known such condition C defines in N the set X. ***
We define a set X \subseteq N that satisfies conditions (1)-(5). No set X \subseteq N will satisfy
conditions (1)-(4) forever, if for every algorithm with no input, at some future day, a computer
will be able to execute this algorithm in 1 second or less. The statement \Phi implies that conditions
(1)-(5) hold for X={1} \cup P(n^2+1).

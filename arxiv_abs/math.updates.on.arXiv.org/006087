Timeliness is an emerging requirement for many Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In IoT networks,
where a large-number of nodes are distributed, severe interference may incur during the transmission
phase which causes age of information (AoI) degradation. It is therefore important to study the
performance limit of AoI as well as how to achieve such limit. In this paper, we aim to optimize the
AoI in random access Poisson networks. By taking into account the spatio-temporal interactions
amongst the transmitters, an expression of the peak AoI is derived, based on explicit expressions
of the optimal peak AoI and the corresponding optimal system parameters including the packet arrival
rate and the channel access probability are further derived. It is shown that with a given packet
arrival rate (resp. a given channel access probability), the optimal channel access probability
(resp. the optimal packet arrival rate), is equal to one under a small node deployment density, and
decrease monotonically as the spatial deployment density increases due to the severe interference
caused by spatio-temproal coupling between transmitters. When joint tuning of the packet arrival
rate and channel access probability is performed, the optimal channel access probability is always
set to be one. Moreover, with the sole tuning of the channel access probability, it is found that the
optimal peak AoI performance can be improved with a smaller packet arrival rate only when the node
deployment density is high, which is contrast to the case of the sole tuning of the packet arrival
rate, where a higher channel access probability always leads to better optimal peak AoI regardless
of the node deployment density. In all the cases of optimal tuning of system parameters, the optimal
peak AoI linearly grows with the node deployment density as opposed to an exponential growth with
fixed system parameters.

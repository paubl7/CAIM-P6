The Balmer spectrum of a monoidal triangulated category is an important geometric construction
which, in many cases, can be used to obtain a classification of thick tensor ideals. Many interesting
examples of monoidal triangulated categories arise as stable categories of finite tensor categories.
Given a finite tensor category, its Drinfeld center is a braided finite tensor category constructed
via half-braidings; in the case that the original category is the category of representations of
a Hopf algebra, then its Drinfeld center is the category of representations of its Drinfeld double.
We prove that the forgetful functor from the Drinfeld center of a finite tensor category ${\mathbf
C}$ to ${\mathbf C}$ extends to a monoidal triangulated functor between their corresponding stable
categories. We then prove that this functor induces a continuous map between the Balmer spectra
of these two stable categories. In the finite-dimensional Hopf algebra setting, we give conditions
under which the image of this continuous map can be realized as a certain intersection of open sets
in the Balmer spectrum, and prove conditions under which it is injective, surjective, or a homeomorphism.
We apply this general theory to the cases that the finite tensor category ${\mathbf C}$ is the category
of modules for group algebras of finite groups $G$ in characteristic $p$ dividing the order of $G$,
more generally to cosemisimple Hopf algebras, and for Benson-Witherspoon smash coproduct Hopf
algebras $H_{G,L}$. In the first case, we are able to prove that the Balmer spectrum for the stable
module category of the Drinfeld double of any cosemisimple quasitriangular Hopf algebra $H$ is
homeomorphic to the Balmer spectrum for the stable module category of $H$ itself, and that thick
ideals of the two categories are in bijection.

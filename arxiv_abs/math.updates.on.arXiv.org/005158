Bump attractors are wandering localised patterns observed in in vivo experiments of spatially-extended
neurobiological networks. They are important for the brain's navigational system and specific
memory tasks. A bump attractor is characterised by a core in which neurons fire frequently, while
those away from the core do not fire. We uncover a relationship between bump attractors and travelling
waves in a classical network of excitable, leaky integrate-and-fire neurons. This relationship
bears strong similarities to the one between complex spatiotemporal patterns and waves at the onset
of pipe turbulence. Waves in the spiking network are determined by a firing set, that is, the collection
of times at which neurons reach a threshold and fire as the wave propagates. We define and study analytical
properties of the voltage mapping, an operator transforming a solution's firing set into its spatiotemporal
profile. This operator allows us to construct localised travelling waves with an arbitrary number
of spikes at the core, and to study their linear stability. A homogeneous "laminar" state exists
in the network, and it is linearly stable for all values of the principal control parameter. Sufficiently
wide disturbances to the homogeneous state elicit the bump attractor. We show that one can construct
waves with a seemingly arbitrary number of spikes at the core; the higher the number of spikes, the
slower the wave, and the more its profile resembles a stationary bump. As in the fluid-dynamical
analogy, such waves coexist with the homogeneous state, are unstable, and the solution branches
to which they belong are disconnected from the laminar state; we provide evidence that the dynamics
of the bump attractor displays echoes of the unstable waves, which form its building blocks.

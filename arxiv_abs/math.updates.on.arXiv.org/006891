The classical Marcinkiewicz theorem states that if an entire characteristic function $\Psi$ of
a non-degenerate real-valued random variable $X$ is of the form $\exp(P(u))$ for some polynomial
$P$, then $X$ has to be a Gaussian. In this work, we obtain a broad, quantitative extension of this
framework in several directions, establish central limit theorems (CLTs) with explicit rates
of convergence, and demonstrate Gaussian fluctuations in continuous spin systems and general
classes of point processes. In particular, we obtain quantitative decay estimates on the Kolmogorov-Smirnov
distance between $X$ and a Gaussian under the condition that $\Psi$ does not vanish only on a bounded
disk. This leads to quantitative CLTs applicable to very general and possibly strongly dependent
random systems. In spite of the general applicability, our rates for the CLT match the classic Berry-Esseen
bounds for independent sums up to a log factor. We implement this programme for two important classes
of models in probability and statistical physics. First, we extend to the setting of continuous
spins a popular paradigm for obtaining CLTs for discrete spin systems that is based on the theory
of Lee-Yang zeros, focussing in particular on the XY model, Heisenberg ferromagnets and generalised
Ising models. Secondly, we establish Gaussian fluctuations for linear statistics of so-called
$\alpha$-determinantal processes for $\alpha \in \mathbb{R}$ (including the usual determinantal,
Poisson and permanental processes) under very general conditions, including in particular higher
dimensional settings where structural alternatives such as random matrix techniques are not available.
Our applications demonstrate the significance of having to control the characteristic function
only on a (small) disk, and lead to CLTs which, to the best of our knowledge, are not known in generality.

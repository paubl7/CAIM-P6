Asymptotic efficiency of targeted maximum likelihood estimators (TMLE) of target features of
the data distribution relies on a a second order remainder being asymptotically negligible. In
previous work we proposed a nonparametric MLE termed Highly Adaptive Lasso (HAL) which parametrizes
the relevant functional of the data distribution in terms of a multivariate real valued cadlag function
that is assumed to have finite variation norm. We showed that the HAL-MLE converges in Kullback-Leibler
dissimilarity at a rate n-1/3 up till logn factors. Therefore, by using HAL as initial density estimator
in the TMLE, the resulting HAL-TMLE is an asymptotically efficient estimator only assuming that
the relevant nuisance functions of the data density are cadlag and have finite variation norm. However,
in finite samples, the second order remainder can dominate the sampling distribution so that inference
based on asymptotic normality would be anti-conservative. In this article we propose a new higher
order TMLE, generalizing the regular first order TMLE. We prove that it satisfies an exact linear
expansion, in terms of efficient influence functions of sequentially defined higher order fluctuations
of the target parameter, with a remainder that is a k+1th order remainder. As a consequence, this
k-th order TMLE allows statistical inference only relying on the k+1th order remainder being negligible.
We also provide a rationale for the higher order TMLE that it will be superior to the first order TMLE
by (iteratively) locally minimizing the exact finite sample remainder of the first order TMLE.
The second order TMLE is demonstrated for nonparametric estimation of the integrated squared density
and for the treatment specific mean outcome. We also provide an initial simulation study for the
second order TMLE of the treatment specific mean confirming the theoretical analysis.

Given a random sample from a multivariate population, estimating the number of large eigenvalues
of the population covariance matrix is an important problem in Statistics with wide applications
in many areas. In the context of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), the linear combinations of
the original variables having the largest amounts of variation are determined by this number. In
this paper, we study the high dimensional asymptotic regime where the number of variables grows
at the same rate as the number of observations, and use the spiked covariance model proposed in Johnstone
(2001), under which the problem reduces to model selection. Our focus is on the Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC) which is known to be strongly consistent from the work of Bai et al. (2018). However,
Bai et al. (2018) requires a certain "gap condition" ensuring the dominant eigenvalues to be above
a threshold strictly larger than the BBP threshold (Baik et al. (2005), both quantities depending
on the limiting ratio of the number of variables and observations. It is well-known that, below the
BBP threshold, a spiked covariance structure becomes indistinguishable from one with no spikes.
Thus the strong consistency of AIC requires some extra signal strength. In this paper, we investigate
whether consistency continues to hold even if the "gap" is made smaller. We show that strong consistency
under arbitrarily small gap is achievable if we alter the penalty term of AIC suitably depending
on the target gap. Furthermore, another intuitive alteration of the penalty can indeed make the
gap exactly zero, although we can only achieve weak consistency in this case. We compare the two newly-proposed
estimators with other existing estimators in the literature via extensive simulation studies,
and show, by suitably calibrating our proposals, that a significant improvement in terms of mean-squared
error is achievable.

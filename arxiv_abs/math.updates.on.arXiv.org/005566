This work further improves the pseudo-transient approach for the Poisson Boltzmann equation (PBE)
in the electrostatic analysis of solvated biomolecules. The numerical solution of the nonlinear
PBE is known to involve many difficulties, such as exponential nonlinear term, strong singularity
by the source terms, and complex dielectric interface. Recently, a pseudo-time ghost-fluid method
(GFM) has been developed in [S. Ahmed Ullah and S. Zhao, Applied Mathematics and Computation, 380,
125267, (2020)], by analytically handling both nonlinearity and singular sources. The GFM interface
treatment not only captures the discontinuity in the regularized potential and its flux across
the molecular surface, but also guarantees the stability and efficiency of the time integration.
However, the molecular surface definition based on the MSMS package is known to induce instability
in some cases, and a nontrivial Lagrangian-to-Eulerian conversion is indispensable for the GFM
finite difference discretization. In this paper, an Eulerian Solvent Excluded Surface (ESES)
is implemented to replace the MSMS for defining the dielectric interface. The electrostatic analysis
shows that the ESES free energy is more accurate than that of the MSMS, while being free of instability
issues. Moreover, this work explores, for the first time in the PBE literature, adaptive time integration
techniques for the pseudo-transient simulations. A major finding is that the time increment $\Delta
t$ should become smaller as the time increases, in order to maintain the temporal accuracy. This
is opposite to the common practice for the steady state convergence, and is believed to be due to the
PBE nonlinearity and its time splitting treatment. Effective adaptive schemes have been constructed
so that the pseudo-time GFM methods become more efficient than the constant $\Delta t$ ones.

Differential Equations are among the most important Mathematical tools used in creating models
in the science, engineering, economics, mathematics, physics, aeronautics, astronomy, dynamics,
biology, chemistry, medicine, environmental sciences, social sciences, banking and many other
areas [7]. A differential equation that has only one independent variable is called an Ordinary
Differential Equation (ODE), and all derivatives in it are taken with respect to that variable.
Most often, the variable is time, t; although, I will use x in this paper as the independent variable.
The differential equation where the unknown function depends on two or more variables is referred
to as Partial Differential Equations (PDE). Ordinary differential equations can be solved by a
variety of methods, analytical and numerical. Although there are many analytic methods for finding
the solution of differential equations, there exist quite a number of differential equations that
cannot be solved analytically [8]. This means that the solution cannot be expressed as the sum of
a finite number of elementary functions (polynomials, exponentials, trigonometric, and hyperbolic
functions). For simple differential equations, it is possible to find closed form solutions [9].
But many differential equations arising in applications are so complicated that it is sometimes
impractical to have solution formulas; or at least if a solution formula is available, it may involve
integrals that can be calculated only by using a numerical quadrature formula. In either case, numerical
methods provide a powerful alternative tool for solving the differential equations under the prescribed
initial condition or conditions [9]. In this paper, I present the basic and commonly used numerical
and analytical methods of solving ordinary differential equations.

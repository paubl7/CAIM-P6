We refine two results in the paper entitled ``Sofic mean dimension'' by Hanfeng Li, improving two
inequalities with two equalities, respectively, for sofic mean dimension of typical actions.
On the one hand, we study sofic mean dimension of full shifts, for which, Li provided an upper bound
which however is not optimal. We prove a more delicate estimate from above, which is optimal for sofic
mean dimension of full shifts over arbitrary alphabets (i.e. compact metrizable spaces). Our refinement,
together with the techniques (in relation to an estimate from below) in the paper entitled ``Mean
dimension of full shifts'' by Masaki Tsukamoto, eventually allows us to get the exact value of sofic
mean dimension of full shifts over any finite dimensional compact metrizable spaces. On the other
hand, we investigate finite group actions. In contrast to the case that the acting group is infinite
(and amenable), Li showed that if a finite group acts continuously on a finite dimensional compact
metrizable space, then sofic mean dimension may be different from (strictly less than) the classical
(i.e. amenable) mean dimension (an explicitly known value in this case). We strengthen this result
by proving a sharp lower bound, which, combining with the upper bound, gives the exact value of sofic
mean dimension for all the actions of finite groups on finite dimensional compact metrizable spaces.
Furthermore, this equality leads to a satisfactory comparison theorem for those actions, deciding
when sofic mean dimension would coincide with classical mean dimension. Moreover, our two results,
in particular, verify for a typical class of sofic group actions that sofic mean dimension does not
depend on sofic approximation sequences.

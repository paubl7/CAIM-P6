Let $R\to A$ be a homomorphism of associative rings, and let $(\mathcal F,\mathcal C)$ be a hereditary
complete cotorsion pair in $R\mathsf{-Mod}$. Let $(\mathcal F_A,\mathcal C_A)$ be the cotorsion
pair in $A\mathsf{-Mod}$ in which $\mathcal F_A$ is the class of all left $A$-modules whose underlying
$R$-modules belong to $\mathcal F$. Assuming that the $\mathcal F$-resolution dimension of every
left $R$-module is finite and the class $\mathcal F$ is preserved by the coinduction functor $\operatorname{Hom}_R(A,-)$,
we show that $\mathcal C_A$ is the class of all direct summands of left $A$-modules finitely filtered
by $A$-modules coinduced from $R$-modules from $\mathcal C$. Assuming that the class $\mathcal
F$ is closed under countable products and preserved by the functor $\operatorname{Hom}_R(A,-)$,
we prove that $\mathcal C_A$ is the class of all direct summands of left $A$-modules cofiltered by
$A$-modules coinduced from $R$-modules from $\mathcal C$, with the decreasing filtration indexed
by the natural numbers. A combined result, based on the assumption that countable products of modules
from $\mathcal F$ have finite $\mathcal F$-resolution dimension bounded by $k$, involves cofiltrations
indexed by the ordinal $\omega+k$. The dual results also hold, provable by the same technique going
back to the author's monograph on semi-infinite homological algebra arXiv:0708.3398. In addition,
we discuss the $n$-cotilting and $n$-tilting cotorsion pairs, for which we obtain better results
using a suitable version of the classical Bongartz lemma. As an illustration of the main results
of the paper, we consider certain cotorsion pairs related to the contraderived and coderived categories
of curved DG-modules.

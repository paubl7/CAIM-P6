We consider a matching market where buyers and sellers arrive according to independent Poisson
processes at the same rate and independently abandon the market if not matched after an exponential
amount of time with the same mean. In this centralized market, the utility for the system manager
from matching any buyer and any seller is a general random variable. We consider a sequence of systems
indexed by $n$ where the arrivals in the $n^{\mathrm{th}}$ system are sped up by a factor of $n$. We
analyze two families of one-parameter policies: the population threshold policy immediately
matches an arriving agent to its best available mate only if the number of mates in the system is above
a threshold, and the utility threshold policy matches an arriving agent to its best available mate
only if the corresponding utility is above a threshold. Using a fluid analysis of the two-dimensional
Markov process of buyers and sellers, we show that when the matching utility distribution is light-tailed,
the population threshold policy with threshold $\frac{n}{\ln n}$ is asymptotically optimal among
all policies that make matches only at agent arrival epochs. In the heavy-tailed case, we characterize
the optimal threshold level for both policies. We also study the utility threshold policy in an unbalanced
matching market with heavy-tailed matching utilities and find that the buyers and sellers have
the same asymptotically optimal utility threshold. We derive optimal thresholds when the matching
utility distribution is exponential, uniform, Pareto, and correlated Pareto. We find that as the
right tail of the matching utility distribution gets heavier, the threshold level of each policy
(and hence market thickness) increases, as does the magnitude by which the utility threshold policy
outperforms the population threshold policy.

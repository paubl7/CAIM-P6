This paper studies the optimal spatial pricing for a ride-sourcing platform subject to a congestion
charge. The platform determines the ride prices over the transportation network to maximize its
profit, while the regulatory agency imposes the congestion charge to reduce traffic congestion
in the urban core. A network economic equilibrium model is proposed to capture the intimate interactions
among passengers, drivers, passenger and driver waiting times, platform pricing, vehicle repositioning
and flow balance over the transportation network. The overall optimal pricing problem is cast as
a non-convex program. An algorithm is proposed to approximately compute its optimal solution,
and a tight upper bound is established to evaluate its performance loss with respect to the globally
optimal solution. Using the proposed model, we compare the impacts of three forms of congestion
charge: (a) a one-directional cordon charge on ride-sourcing vehicles that enter the congestion
area; (b) a bi-directional cordon charge on ride-sourcing vehicles that enter or exit the congestion
area; (c) a trip-based congestion charge on all ride-sourcing trips that either start from, end
in, or pass through the congestion area. We show that the one-directional congestion charge not
only reduces the ride-sourcing traffic in the congestion area, but also improves the service quality
outside the congestion zone and benefits passengers in these underserved areas. We establish that
in all congestion charge schemes the largest share of the tax burden is carried by the platforms,
as opposed to passengers and drivers. We further show that compared to other congestion charges,
the one-directional cordon charge is more effective in congestion mitigation, whereas the trip-based
congestion charge is more effective in revenue-raising. We validate these results through realistic
numerical studies for San Francisco.

The Cauchy-Dirichlet pbm for the superquadratic viscous Hamilton-Jacobi eqn (VHJ), which has
important applications in stochastic control theory, admits a unique, global viscosity solution.
Sol. thus exist in the weak sense after appearance of singularity in finite time, which occurs through
gradient blow-up (GBU) on the boundary. Whereas theory of visc. sol. has been extensively studied
and applied to many PDEs, there are less results on refined behavior of sol. In particular, detailed
behavior of visc. sol. of VHJ after GBU has remained mostly open. Here, in general dim., for each $m\ge
1$ we construct sol. which undergo GBU and LBC at least at $m$ times and then recover regularity, as
well as sol. that exhibit GBU without LBC at 1st blowup time. In 1d, we obtain the complete classification
of visc. sol. at each time, which extends to radial cases in higher d. Furthermore for each $m\ge 2$
and arbitrarily given combination of GBU types with/without LBC at $m$ times in arbitrarily given
order, we show exist. of a sol. with this exact combination of GBU. Some sol. display a new type of behavior
called "bouncing". Global weak sol. of VHJ with multiple time singularity turn out to display larger
variety of behaviors than for the Fujita eqn. We introduce a method based on an arbitrary number of
critical parameters, whose continuity requires a delicate argument. Since we do not rely on any
known special sol. unlike in Fujita eqn, our method is expected to apply to other eqns. Singular behaviors
at multiple times are completely new in the context of VHJ but also of stochastic control theory.
In this framework our results imply that for certain spatial distributions of rewards, if a controled
Brownian particle starts near the boundary, then the net gain attains profitable values on different
time horizons but not on some intermediate times.

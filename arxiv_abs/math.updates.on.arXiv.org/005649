We study foliations by non-smooth chord-arc Jordan curves of the twice punctured Riemann sphere
$\mathbb C \smallsetminus \{0\}$ using the Loewner-Kufarev equation. We associate to such a foliation
a function on the plane that describes the "local winding" along each leaf. Our main theorem is that
this function has finite Dirichlet energy if and only if the Loewner driving measure $\rho$ has finite
Loewner-Kufarev energy, defined by $$S(\rho) = \frac{1}{2}\int_{S^1 \times \mathbb{R}} \nu_t'(\theta)^2
\, d \theta d t$$ whenever $\rho$ is of the form $\nu_t(\theta)^2 d\theta dt$, and set to $\infty$
otherwise. Moreover, if either of these two energies is finite they are equal up to a constant factor
and in this case the foliation leaves are Weil-Petersson quasicircles. This duality between energies
has several consequences. The first is that the Loewner-Kufarev energy is reversible, that is,
invariant with respect to inversion and time-reversal of the foliation. Furthermore, the Loewner
energy of a Jordan curve can be expressed using the minimal Loewner-Kufarev energy of those measures
that generate the curve as a leaf. This provides a new and quantitative characterization of Weil-Petersson
quasicircles. Finally, we consider conformal distortion of the foliation, and show that the Loewner-Kufarev
energy satisfies an exact transformation law involving the Schwarzian derivative. The proof of
our main result uses an isometry between the Dirichlet energy space and $L^2(2\rho)$ that we construct
using a version of Hadamard's formula expressed by means of the Loewner-Kufarev equation. While
our results and methods use no probability theory, there are links to probabilistic models. In particular,
$\kappa$-parameter duality and large deviations of Schramm-Loewner evolutions coupled with
Gaussian random fields.

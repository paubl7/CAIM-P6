Let K be a field equipped with a valuation. Tropical varieties over K can be defined with a theory of
Gr{\"o}bner bases taking into account the valuation of K. Because of the use of the valuation, the
theory of tropical Gr{\"o}bner bases has proved to provide settings for computations over polynomial
rings over a p-adic field that are more stable than that of classical Gr{\"o}bner bases. In this article,
we investigate how the FGLM change of ordering algorithm can be adapted to the tropical setting.
As the valuations of the polynomial coefficients are taken into account, the classical FGLM algorithm's
incremental way, monomo-mial by monomial, to compute the multiplication matrices and the change
of basis matrix can not be transposed at all to the tropical setting. We mitigate this issue by developing
new linear algebra algorithms and apply them to our new tropical FGLM algorithms. Motivations are
twofold. Firstly, to compute tropical varieties, one usually goes through the computation of many
tropical Gr{\"o}bner bases defined for varying weights (and then varying term orders). For an ideal
of dimension 0, the tropical FGLM algorithm provides an efficient way to go from a tropical Gr{\"o}bner
basis from one weight to one for another weight. Secondly, the FGLM strategy can be applied to go from
a tropical Gr{\"o}bner basis to a classical Gr{\"o}bner basis. We provide tools to chain the stable
computation of a tropical Gr{\"o}bner basis (for weight [0,. .. , 0]) with the p-adic stabilized
variants of FGLM of [RV16] to compute a lexicographical or shape position basis. All our algorithms
have been implemented into SageMath. We provide numerical examples to illustrate time-complexity.
We then illustrate the superiority of our strategy regarding to the stability of p-adic numerical
computations.

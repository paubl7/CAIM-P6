We make precise the analogy between Goodwillie's calculus of functors in homotopy theory and the
differential calculus of smooth manifolds by introducing a higher-categorical framework of which
both theories are examples. That framework is an extension to infinity-categories of the tangent
categories of Cockett and Cruttwell (introduced originally by Rosick\'y). A tangent structure
on an infinity-category X consists of an endofunctor on X, which plays the role of the tangent bundle
construction, together with various natural transformations that mimic structure possessed
by the ordinary tangent bundles of smooth manifolds and that satisfy similar conditions. The tangent
bundle functor in Goodwillie calculus is Lurie's tangent bundle for infinity-categories, introduced
to generalize the cotangent complexes of Andr\'e, Quillen and Illusie. We show that Lurie's construction
admits the additional structure maps and satisfies the conditions needed to form a tangent infinity-category,
which we refer to as the Goodwillie tangent structure on the infinity-category of infinity-categories.
Cockett and Cruttwell (and others) have started to develop various aspects of differential geometry
in the abstract context of tangent categories, and we begin to apply those ideas to Goodwillie calculus.
For example, we show that the role of Euclidean spaces in the calculus of manifolds is played in Goodwillie
calculus by the stable infinity-categories. We also show that Goodwillie's n-excisive functors
are the direct analogues of n-jets of smooth maps between manifolds; to state that connection precisely,
we develop a notion of tangent (infinity, 2)-category and show that Goodwillie calculus is best
understood in that context.

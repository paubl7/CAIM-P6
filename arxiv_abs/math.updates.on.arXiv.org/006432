We consider the uplink transmission between a multi-antenna ground station and an unmanned aerial
vehicle (UAV) swarm. The UAVs are assumed as intelligent agents, which can explore their optimal
three dimensional (3-D) deployment to maximize the channel capacity of the multiple input multiple
output (MIMO) system. Specifically, considering the limitations of each UAV in accessing the global
information of the network, we focus on a decentralized control strategy by noting that each UAV
in the swarm can only utilize the local information to achieve the optimal 3-D deployment. In this
case, the optimization problem can be divided into several optimization sub-problems with respect
to the rank function. Due to the non-convex nature of the rank function and the fact that the optimization
sub-problems are coupled, the original problem is NP-hard and, thus, cannot be solved with standard
convex optimization solvers. Interestingly, we can relax the constraint condition of each sub-problem
and solve the optimization problem by a formulated UAVs channel capacity maximization game. We
analyze such game according to the designed reward function and the potential function. Then, we
discuss the existence of the pure Nash equilibrium in the game. To achieve the best Nash equilibrium
of the MIMO system, we develop a decentralized learning algorithm, namely decentralized UAVs channel
capacity learning. The details of the algorithm are provided, and then, the convergence, the effectiveness
and the computational complexity are analyzed, respectively. Moreover, we give some insightful
remarks based on the proofs and the theoretical analysis. Also, extensive simulations illustrate
that the developed learning algorithm can achieve a high MIMO channel capacity by optimizing the
3-D UAV swarm deployment with the local information.

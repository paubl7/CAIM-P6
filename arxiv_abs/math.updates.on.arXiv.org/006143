We study fine global properties of nonnegative solutions to the Cauchy Problem for the fast $p$-Laplacian
evolution equation $u_t=\Delta_p u$ on the whole Euclidean space, in the so-called "good fast diffusion
range" $\tfrac{2N}{N+1}<p<2$. It is well-known that non-negative solutions behave for large
times as $\mathcal{B}$, the Barenblatt (or fundamental) solution, which has an explicit expression.
We prove the so-called Global Harnack Principle (GHP), that is, precise global pointwise upper
and lower estimates of nonnegative solutions in terms of $\mathcal{B}$. This can be considered
the nonlinear counterpart of the celebrated Gaussian estimates for the linear heat equation. We
characterize the maximal (hence optimal) class of initial data such that the GHP holds, by means
of an integral tail condition, easy to check. The GHP is then used as a tool to analyze the fine asymptotic
behavior for large times. For initial data that satisfy the same integral condition, we prove that
the corresponding solutions behave like the Barenblatt with the same mass, uniformly in relative
error. When the integral tail condition is not satisfied we show that both the GHP and the uniform
convergence in relative error, do not hold anymore, and we provide also explicit counterexamples.
We then prove a "generalized GHP", that is, pointwise upper and lower bounds in terms of explicit
profiles with a tail different from $\mathcal{B}$. Finally, we derive sharp global quantitative
upper bounds of the modulus of the gradient of the solution, and, when data are radially decreasing,
we show uniform convergence in relative error for the gradients. To the best of our knowledge, analogous
issues for the linear heat equation $p=2$, do not possess such clear answers, only partial results
are known.

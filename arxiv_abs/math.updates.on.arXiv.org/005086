In many applications, data and/or parameters are supported on non-Euclidean manifolds. It is important
to take into account the geometric structure of manifolds in statistical analysis to avoid misleading
results. Although there has been a considerable focus on simple and specific manifolds, there is
a lack of general and easy-to-implement statistical methods for density estimation and modeling
on manifolds. In this article, we consider a very broad class of manifolds: non-compact Riemannian
symmetric spaces. For this class, we provide a very general mathematical result for easily calculating
volume changes of the exponential and logarithm map between the tangent space and the manifold.
This allows one to define statistical models on the tangent space, push these models forward onto
the manifold, and easily calculate induced distributions by Jacobians. To illustrate the statistical
utility of this theoretical result, we provide a general method to construct distributions on symmetric
spaces. In particular, we define the log-Gaussian distribution as an analogue of the multivariate
Gaussian distribution in Euclidean space. With these new kernels on symmetric spaces, we also consider
the problem of density estimation. Our proposed approach can use any existing density estimation
approach designed for Euclidean spaces and push it forward to the manifold with an easy-to-calculate
adjustment. We provide theorems showing that the induced density estimators on the manifold inherit
the statistical optimality properties of the parent Euclidean density estimator; this holds for
both frequentist and Bayesian nonparametric methods. We illustrate the theory and practical utility
of the proposed approach on the space of positive definite matrices.

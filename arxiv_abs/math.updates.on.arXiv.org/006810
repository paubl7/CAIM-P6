We consider integer programs whose constraint matrix has a special block structure: $\min\{f(x):H_{com}x=b,
l\le x\le u,x\in\mathbb{Z}^{t_B+nt_A}\}$, where the objective function $f$ is separable convex
and the constraint matrix $H_ {com}$ is composed of small submatrices $A_i,B,C,D_i$ such that the
first row is $(C,D_1,D_2,\ldots,D_n)$, the first column is $(C,B,B,\ldots,B)^{\top}$, the main
diagonal is $(C,A_1,A_2,\ldots,A_n)$, and the rest entries are 0. Furthermore, $\text{rank}(B)$=1.
We study fixed parameter tractable (FPT) algorithms by taking as parameters the number of rows and
columns of small submatrices, together with the largest absolute value over their entries. We call
the IP (almost) combinatorial 4-block n-fold IP. It generalizes n-fold IP and is a special case of
4-block n-fold IP. The existence of FPT algorithms for 4-block n-fold IP is a major open problem and
Chen et al. [ESA 2020] showed that the $\ell_\infty$-norm of Graver basis elements of 4-block n-fold
IP is $\Omega(n)$. This motivates us to study special cases of 4-block n-fold IP to find structural
insights. We show the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm of Graver basis elements of combinatorial 4-block
n-fold IP is $\Omega(n)$. There is some FPT-value $\lambda$ such that for any nonzero element $g\in\{x:
H_{com} x= 0\}$, $\lambda g$ can always be decomposed into Graver basis elements in the same orthant
whose $\ell_{\infty}$-norm is FPT-bounded (while g might not admit such a decomposition). Then
we can bound the $\ell_{\infty}$-norm of Graver basis elements by $O_{FPT}(n)$ and develop $O_{FPT}(n^{3+o(1)})$-time
algorithms ($O_{FPT}$ hides a multiplicative FPT-term). Combinatorial 4-block n-fold IP can
be used to model some classical problems, including scheduling with rejection and bicriteria scheduling,
which implies that our FPT algorithm establishes a general framework to settle those problems.

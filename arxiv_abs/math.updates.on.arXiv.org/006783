In this article we prove a ``global existence and full smooth convergence theorem'' for flow lines
of the M\"obius-invariant Willmore flow, and we use this result, in order to prove that fully and
smoothly convergent flow lines of the M\"obius-invariant Willmore flow are stable w.r.t. perturbations
of their initial immersions in any $C^{4,\gamma}$-norm, provided they converge to a smooth parametrization
of ``a Clifford-torus'' in $\mathbb{S}^3$. More precisely, in our stability result we prove that
for every $C^{\infty}$-smooth initial immersion $F_0:\Sigma \longrightarrow \mathbb{S}^3$,
whose corresponding unique flow line of the M\"obius-invariant Willmore flow converges fully
and smoothly to a diffeomorphic parametrization of ``a Clifford-torus'' in $\mathbb{S}^3$, and
for every fixed $k\in \mathbb{N}$ and $\gamma \in (0,1)$, there is a small open ball $B_{r}(F_0)$
in $C^{4,\gamma}(\Sigma,\mathbb{R}^4)$ about the immersion $F_0$, such that for any $C^{\infty}$-smooth
initial immersion $F:\Sigma \longrightarrow \mathbb{S}^3$ in $B_{r}(F_0)$ the corresponding
flow line $\{\mathcal{P}(\,\cdot\,,0,F)\}$ of the M\"obius-invariant Willmore flow exists
globally and converges - up to smooth reparametrization - fully in $C^k(\Sigma,\mathbb{R}^4)$
to a smooth immersion, which parametrizes ``a Clifford-torus'' in $\mathbb{S}^3$. The proof relies
on a combination of the author's achievements and techniques of his recent papers - treating the
M\"obius-invariant Willmore flow - with Escher's, Mayer's and Simonett's work from ``the 90ies''
on invariant center manifolds for uniformly parabolic quasilinear evolution equations and their
special applications to the ``Willmore flow'' and ``Surface diffusion flow'' near round $2$-spheres
in $\mathbb{R}^3$.

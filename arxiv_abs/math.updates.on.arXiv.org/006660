There are two ways to unify gravitational field and gauge field. One is to represent gravitational
field as principal bundle connection, and the other is to represent gauge field as affine connection.
Poincar{\'{e}} gauge theory and metric-affine gauge theory adopt the first approach. This paper
adopts the second. This theory has the following advantages. (i) Gauge field and gravitational
field can both be represented by affine connection; they can be described by a unified spatial frame.
(ii) Time can be regarded as the total metric with respect to all dimensions of internal coordinate
space and external coordinate space. On-shell can be regarded as gradient direction. Quantum theory
can be regarded as a geometric theory of distribution of gradient directions. Hence, gravitational
theory and quantum theory obtain the same view of time and space and a unified description of evolution
in affine connection representation of gauge fields. (iii) Chiral asymmetry, coupling constants,
MNS mixing and CKM mixing can appear spontaneously as geometric properties in affine connection
representation, whereas in $U(1) \times SU(2)\times SU(3)$ principal bundle connection representation
they can just only be artificially set up. Some postulates of the Standard Model can be turned into
theorems in affine connection representation, so they are not necessary to be regarded as postulates
anymore. (iv) The unification theory of gauge fields that are represented by affine connection
can avoid the problem that a proton decays into a lepton. (v) There exists a possible geometric interpretation
to the color confinement of quarks. The Standard Model is not possessed of the above advantages.
In the affine connection representation, we can get better interpretations of these physical properties.
This is probably a necessary step towards the ultimate theory of physics.

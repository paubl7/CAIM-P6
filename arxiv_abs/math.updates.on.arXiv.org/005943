Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has becoming a useful tool in future wireless communication
systems for close-distance communication network. This paper we use Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surface (RIS) for downlink multi-user communication designed to improve energy collection performance
while satisfying wireless information and Power Transfer (WIPT). The designed system consists
of an IRS-assisted system consists of a multi-antenna assisted base station (BS) and two opposite
multi-antenna assisted information receiver cooperated (RIS) as energy receiver (ERs) that meets
energy collection requirements. Based on the electromagnetic property of Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surface (RIS), like two mirrors that are opposite each other, setting two Reconfigurable Intelligent
Surface (RIS) attached to the city buildings to reflect the sending signals. The transmitting precoding
of the Multi-antenna Auxiliary Base Station (BS) and the angular phase transfer matrix of the multi-antenna
Auxiliary Information Receiver (IRs) need to be optimized together to maximize the energy harvesting
of IoT devices for energy efficiency (EE) of the IRs system and to provide users with the efficiency
of the received signal. In order to solve the joint optimization problem effectively, we turn the
non-convex maximize problem into the equivalent formal error method based on the mean square, and
finally use the iterative algorithm for optimization. As for algorithm, we respectively use MSE
method, semidefinite relaxation techniques to simplify transmitting beamforming matrix and
the matrix phase shift. Through the observation of simulation data, it can be concluded that the
performance optimization method of SDR based on RIS is effective.

We study the hardness of Approximate Query Processing (AQP) of various types of queries involving
joins over multiple tables of possibly different sizes. In the case where the query result is a single
value (e.g., COUNT, SUM, and COUNT(DISTINCT)), we prove worst-case information-theoretic lower
bounds for AQP problems that are given parameters $\epsilon$ and $\delta$, and return estimated
results within a factor of 1+$\epsilon$ of the true results with error probability at most $\delta$.
In particular, the lower bounds for cardinality estimation over joins under various settings are
contained in our results. Informally, our results show that for various database queries with joins,
unless restricted to the set of queries whose results are always guaranteed to be above a very large
threshold, the amount of information an AQP algorithm needs for returning an accurate approximation
is at least linear in the number of rows in the largest table. Similar lower bounds even hold for some
special cases where additional information such as top-K heavy hitters and all frequency vectors
are available. In the case of GROUP-BY where the query result is not a single number, we study the lower
bound for the amount of information used by any approximation algorithm that does not report any
non-existing group and does not miss groups of large total size. Our work extends the work of Alon,
Gibbons, Matias, and Szegedy [AGMS99].We compare our lower bounds with the amount of information
required by Bernoulli sampling to give an accurate approximation. For COUNT queries with joins
over multiple tables of the same size, the upper bound matches the lower bound, unless the problem
setting is restricted to the set of queries whose results are always guaranteed to be above a very
large threshold.

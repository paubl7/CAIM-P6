In the existing theoretical physics there are too many principles and postulates, which are independent
of each other. It is an important problem that how to find out some principles that are more essential
to minimize the number of principles and postulates. This paper proposes a solution to this problem,
based on the intrinsic differential geometry. First, we show a generalization of intrinsic differential
geometry, hence the Riemannian geometry becomes a subgeometry. In such a new geometry, there exists
a new affine connection, which reflects some more intrinsic properties of differentiable manifold
than the Levi-Civita connection. These properties are closely related to gauge fields and elementary
particles. Then, we apply such a generalized intrinsic geometry to establishing an eight-dimmensional
unified coordinate description of gauge field and gravitational field. (1)Gauge field and gravitational
field have the same affine connection representation. (2)Time can be regarded as the total metric
with respect to all internal and external spacial dimensions. Actual evolution can be regarded
as a gradient direction field. Quantum theory can be regarded as a theory of distribution of gradient
directions. These geometric ideas make gravitational theory and quantum theory become coordinated,
so they have the same view of time and space and a unified description of evolution. (3)The generalized
intrinsic geometry makes gauge field and elementary particle field originate from the same geometric
construction at a deeper level. Many postulates of the Standard Model are turned into theorems in
the new framework, thereby they are not necessary to be regarded as postulates anymore. (4)Many
principles, postulates and artificially introduced equations of fundamental physics are turned
into theorems based on a unique fundamental axiom, hence they obtain a common origination at a deeper
level.

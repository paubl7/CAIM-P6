The Steiner Team Orienteering Problem (STOP) is defined on a digraph in which arcs are associated
with traverse times, and whose vertices are labeled as either mandatory or profitable, being the
latter provided with rewards (profits). Given a homogeneous fleet of vehicles M, the goal is to find
up to m = |M| disjoint routes (from an origin vertex to a destination one) that maximize the total sum
of rewards collected while satisfying a given limit on the route's duration. Naturally, all mandatory
vertices must be visited. In this work, we show that solely finding a feasible solution for STOP is
NP-hard and propose a Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) heuristic for the problem. The algorithm
is provided with initial solutions obtained by means of the matheuristic framework known as Feasibility
Pump (FP). In our implementation, FP uses as backbone a commodity-based formulation reinforced
by three classes of valid inequalities. To our knowledge, two of them are also introduced in this
work. The LNS heuristic itself combines classical local searches from the literature of routing
problems with a long-term memory component based on Path Relinking. We use the primal bounds provided
by a state-of-the-art cutting-plane algorithm from the literature to evaluate the quality of the
solutions obtained by the heuristic. Computational experiments show the efficiency and effectiveness
of the proposed heuristic in solving a benchmark of 387 instances. Overall, the heuristic solutions
imply an average percentage gap of only 0.54% when compared to the bounds of the cutting-plane baseline.
In particular, the heuristic reaches the best previously known bounds on 382 of the 387 instances.
Additionally, in 21 of these cases, our heuristic is even able to improve over the best known bounds.

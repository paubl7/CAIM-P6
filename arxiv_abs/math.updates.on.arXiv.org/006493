Quantum invariants like the colored Jones polynomial are algebraic in nature but are conjectured
to detect important information about the geometry of links. In this thesis we explore these connections
using an enhanced version of the RT construction. Our invariants take the holonomy of a flat connection
on the link complement as input, so we call them holonomy invariants. The case of trivial holonomy
recovers the ordinary RT construction. We consider holonomy representations into $\operatorname{SL}_2(\mathbb
C)$, which are closely related to hyperbolic geometry. In order to define our invariants we consider
a particular coordinate system on the space of representations closely related to the octahedral
decomposition of the knot complement. We call the corresponding diagrams shaped tangles. Using
shaped tangles we define a family of holonomy invariants $\mathrm{J}_N$ indexed by integers $N
\ge 2$, which we call the nonabelian quantum dilogarithm. They can be interpreted as a noncommutative
deformation of Kashaev's quantum dilogarithm (equivalently, the $N$th colored Jones polynomial
at a $N$th root of unity) or of the ADO invariants, depending on the eigenvalues of the holonomy. Our
construction depends in an essential way on representations of quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ at $q
= \xi$ a primitive $2N$th root of unity. We show that $\mathrm{J}_N$ is defined up to a power of $\xi$
and does not depend on the gauge class of the holonomy. Afterwards we introduce a version of the quantum
double construction for the holonomy invariants. We show that the quantum double $\mathrm{T}_N$
of the nonabelian dilogarithm $\mathrm{J}_N$ admits a canonical normalization with no phase ambiguity.
Finally, we prove that in the case $N = 2$ the doubled invariant $\mathrm{T}_2$ computes the Reidemeister
torsion of the link complement twisted by the holonomy representation.

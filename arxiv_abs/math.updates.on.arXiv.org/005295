Topology optimization (TopOpt) is a mathematical-driven design procedure to realize optimal
material architectures. This procedure is often used to automate the design of devices involving
flow through porous media, such as micro-fluidic devices. TopOpt offers material layouts that
control the flow of fluids through porous materials, providing desired functionalities. Many
prior studies in this application area have used Darcy equations for primal analysis and the minimum
power theorem (MPT) to drive the optimization problem. But both these choices (Darcy equations
and MPT) are restrictive and not valid for general working conditions of modern devices. Being simple
and linear, Darcy equations are often used to model flow of fluids through porous media. However,
two inherent assumptions of the Darcy model are: the viscosity of a fluid is a constant, and inertial
effects are negligible. There is irrefutable experimental evidence that viscosity of a fluid,
especially organic liquids, depends on the pressure. Given the typical small pore-sizes, inertial
effects are dominant in micro-fluidic devices. Next, MPT is not a general principle and is not valid
for (nonlinear) models that relax the assumptions of the Darcy model. This paper aims to overcome
the mentioned deficiencies by presenting a general strategy for using TopOpt. First, we will consider
nonlinear models that take into account the pressure-dependent viscosity and inertial effects,
and study the effect of these nonlinearities on the optimal material layouts under TopOpt. Second,
we will explore the rate of mechanical dissipation, valid even for nonlinear models, as an alternative
for the objective function. Third, we will present analytical solutions of optimal designs for
canonical problems; these solutions not only possess research and pedagogical values but also
facilitate verification of computer implementations.

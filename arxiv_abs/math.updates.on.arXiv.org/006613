For the Newtonian (gravitational) $n$-body problem in the Euclidean $d$-dimensional space, $d\ge
2$, the simplest possible periodic solutions are provided by circular relative equilibria, (RE)
for short, namely solutions in which each body rigidly rotates about the center of mass and the configuration
of the whole system is constant in time and central (or, more generally, balanced) configuration.
For $d\le 3$, the only possible (RE) are planar, but in dimension four it is possible to get truly four
dimensional (RE). A classical problem in celestial mechanics aims at relating the (in-)stability
properties of a (RE) to the index properties of the central (or, more generally, balanced) configuration
generating it. In this paper, we provide sufficient conditions that imply the spectral instability
of planar and non-planar (RE) in $\mathbb R^4$ generated by a central configuration, thus answering
some of the questions raised in \cite[Page 63]{Moe14}. As a corollary, we retrieve a classical result
of Hu and Sun \cite{HS09} on the linear instability of planar (RE) whose generating central configuration
is non-degenerate and has odd Morse index, and fix a gap in the statement of \cite[Theorem 1]{BJP14}
about the spectral instability of planar (RE) whose (possibly degenerate) generating central
configuration has odd Morse index. The key ingredients are a new formula of independent interest
that allows to compute the spectral flow of a path of symmetric matrices having degenerate starting
point, and a symplectic decomposition of the phase space of the linearized Hamiltonian system along
a given (RE) which is inspired by Meyer and Schmidt's planar decomposition \cite{MS05} and which
allows us to rule out the uninteresting part of the dynamics corresponding to the translational
and (partially) to the rotational symmetry of the problem.

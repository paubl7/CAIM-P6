Rare/Weak models for multiple hypothesis testing assume that only a small proportion of the tested
hypotheses concern non-null effects and the individual effects are only moderately large, so that
they generally do not stand out individually, for example in a Bonferroni analysis. Such rare/weak
models have been studied in quite a few settings, for example in some cases studies focused on underlying
Gaussian means model for the hypotheses being tested; in some others, Poisson. It seems not to have
been noticed before that such seemingly different models have asymptotically the following common
structure: Summarizing the evidence each test provides by the negative logarithm of its P-value,
previous rare/weak model settings are asymptotically equivalent to detection where most negative
log P-values have a standard exponential distribution but a small fraction of the P-values might
have an alternative distribution which is moderately larger; we do not know which individual tests
those might be, or even if there are any such. Moreover, the alternative distribution is noncentral
chisquared on one degree of freedom. We characterize the asymptotic performance of global tests
combining these P-values in terms of the chisquared mixture parameters: the scaling parameters
controlling heteroscedasticity, the non-centrality parameter describing the effect size whenever
it exists, and the parameter controlling the rarity of the non-null effects. Specifically, in a
phase space involving the last two parameters, we derive a region where all tests are asymptotically
powerless. Outside of this region, the Berk-Jones and the Higher Criticism tests have maximal power.
Inference techniques based on the minimal P-value, false-discovery rate controlling, and Fisher's
test have sub-optimal asymptotic phase diagrams. We provide various examples for multiple testing
problems of the said common structure.

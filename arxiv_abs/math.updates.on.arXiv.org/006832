In this paper, we propose a new dynamic IRS beamforming framework to boost the sum throughput of an
intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided wireless powered communication network (WPCN). Specifically,
the IRS phase-shift vectors across time and resource allocation are jointly optimized to enhance
the efficiencies of both downlink wireless power transfer (DL WPT) and uplink wireless information
transmission (UL WIT) between a hybrid access point (HAP) and multiple wirelessly powered devices.
To this end, we first study three special cases of the dynamic IRS beamforming,namely user-adaptive
IRS beamforming, UL-adaptive IRS beamforming, and static IRS beamforming,by characterizing
their optimal performance relationships and proposing corresponding algorithms. Interestingly,
it is rigorously proved that the latter two cases achieve the same throughput, thus helping halve
the number of IRS phase shifts to be optimized and signalling overhead practically required for
UL-adaptive IRS beamforming. Then, we propose a general optimization framework for dynamic IRS
beamforming, which is applicable for any given number of IRS phase-shift vectors available. Despite
of the non-convexity of the general problem with highly coupled optimization variables, we propose
two algorithms to solve it and particularly, the low-complexity algorithm exploits the intrinsic
structure of the optimal solution as well as the solutions to the cases with user-adaptive and static
IRS beamforming. Simulation results validate our theoretical findings, illustrate the practical
significance of IRS with dynamic beamforming for spectral and energy efficient WPCNs, and demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed designs over various benchmark schemes.

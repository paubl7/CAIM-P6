In the existing theoretical physics there are too many principles and postulates, which are independent
of each other. It is an important problem that how to find out some principles that are more essential
to minimize the number of principles and postulates. This paper proposes a solution to this problem,
based on an affine connection representation of gauge fields. There are two ways to unify gravitational
field and gauge field. One is to represent gravitational field as principal bundle connection,
and the other is to represent gauge field as affine connection. Poincare gauge theory and metric-affine
gauge theory both adopt the first approach. This paper adopts the second. First, we show a generalization
of Riemannian intrinsic geometry, where there exists a new affine connection, which is different
from spin connection and Riemann-Cartan connection. We speak of it as simple connection. It reflects
some more intrinsic properties of differentiable manifold than Levi-Civita connection. Then,
we apply such a generalized intrinsic geometry to establishing an unified coordinate description
of gauge field and gravitational field. It has the following advantages. (1)Gauge field and gravitational
field have the same affine connection representation. (2)Time can be regarded as the total metric
with respect to all dimensions of internal coordinate space and external coordinate space, and
actual evolution can be regarded as gradient direction field, and quantum theory can be regarded
as a theory of distribution of gradient directions. Hence, gravitational theory and quantum theory
obtain the same view of time and space and a unified description of evolution. (3)Many principles,
postulates and artificially introduced equations of fundamental physics and Standard Model are
turned into theorems, which mathematically and logically originate from a unique fundamental
axiom at a deeper level.

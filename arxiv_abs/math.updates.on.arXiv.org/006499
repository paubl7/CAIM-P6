In this work, we propose and develop efficient and accurate numerical methods for solving the Kirchhoff-Love
plate model in domains with complex geometries. The algorithms proposed here employ curvilinear
finite-difference methods for spatial discretization of the governing PDEs on general composite
overlapping grids. The coupling of different components of the composite overlapping grid is through
numerical interpolations. However, interpolations introduce perturbation to the finite-difference
discretization, which causes numerical instability for time-stepping schemes used to advance
the resulted semi-discrete system. To address the instability, we propose to add a fourth-order
hyper-dissipation to the spatially discretized system to stabilize its time integration; this
additional dissipation term captures the essential upwinding effect of the original upwind scheme.
The investigation of strategies for incorporating the upwind dissipation term into several time-stepping
schemes (both explicit and implicit) leads to the development of four novel algorithms. For each
algorithm, formulas for determining a stable time step and a sufficient dissipation coefficient
on curvilinear grids are derived by performing a local Fourier analysis. Quadratic eigenvalue
problems for a simplified model plate in 1D domain are considered to reveal the weak instability
due to the presence of interpolating equations in the spatial discretization. This model problem
is further investigated for the stabilization effects of the proposed algorithms. Carefully designed
numerical experiments are carried out to validate the accuracy and stability of the proposed algorithms,
followed by two benchmark problems to demonstrate the capability and efficiency of our approach
for solving realistic applications. Results that concern the performance of the proposed algorithms
are also presented.

The Information bottleneck (IB) method enables optimizing over the trade-off between compression
of data and prediction accuracy of learned representations, and has successfully and robustly
been applied to both supervised and unsupervised representation learning problems. However,
IB has several limitations. First, the IB problem is hard to optimize. The IB Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}_{IB}:=I(X;Z)-\beta
I(Y;Z)$ is non-convex and existing solutions guarantee only local convergence. As a result, the
obtained solutions depend on initialization. Second, the evaluation of a solution is also a challenging
task. Conventionally, it resorts to characterizing the information plane, that is, plotting $I(Y;Z)$
versus $I(X;Z)$ for all solutions obtained from different initial points. Furthermore, the IB
Lagrangian has phase transitions while varying the multiplier $\beta$. At phase transitions,
both $I(X;Z)$ and $I(Y;Z)$ increase abruptly and the rate of convergence becomes significantly
slow for existing solutions. Recent works with IB adopt variational surrogate bounds to the IB Lagrangian.
Although allowing efficient optimization, how close are these surrogates to the IB Lagrangian
is not clear. In this work, we solve the IB Lagrangian using augmented Lagrangian methods. With augmented
variables, we show that the IB objective can be solved with the alternating direction method of multipliers
(ADMM). Different from prior works, we prove that the proposed algorithm is consistently convergent,
regardless of the value of $\beta$. Empirically, our gradient-descent-based method results in
information plane points that are comparable to those obtained through the conventional Blahut-Arimoto-based
solvers and is convergent for a wider range of the penalty coefficient than previous ADMM solvers.

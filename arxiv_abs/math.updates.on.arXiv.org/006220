One of the open problems in Algebraic topology is the "hit" problem for a module over the Steenrod
ring $\mathscr A$. The problem asks a minimal set of generators for the polynomial algebra $\mathcal
P_m:=\mathbb F_2[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m] = H^*((K(\mathbb F_2, 1))^{\times m})$ regarded as a connected
unstable $\mathscr A$-module on $m$ generators with $|x_i| = 1$ for every $i$. The hit problem has
been thoroughly studied for 35 years in a variety of contexts by many authors and completely solved
for $m\leq 4.$ Furthermore, it is applied in studying the cohomology of $\mathscr A$ via the $m$-th
algebraic transfer $Tr^{\mathscr A}_m$ of William Singer [35]. The aim of this work is to continue
our study of the hit problem of five variables. At the same time, applying this result into the investigation
of the fifth Singer transfer map. More precisely, we extend a result in [26] on the hit problem for
$\mathscr A$-module $\mathcal P_5$ in the "generic" degree $5(2^t-1) + 18.2^t$ with $t\geq 0.$
This result confirms a conjecture of Sum [39] on the relation between the minimal set of $\mathscr
A$-generators for the polynomial algebras $\mathcal P_{m}$ and $\mathcal P_{m-1}$ in the case
$m=5$ and the above generic degree. As a consequence, we obtain the $\mathscr A$-generators for
$\mathcal P_6$ in the generic degree $5(2^{t+5}-1) + 41.2^{t+5}$ with $t\geq 0.$ Using the above
result and a presentation in the $\lambda$-algebra of $Tr_5^{\mathscr A}$, we show that the non-trivial
element $h_1e_0 = h_0f_0\in {\rm Ext}_{\mathscr A}^{5, 5+(5(2^0-1) + 18.2^0)}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb
F_2)$ is in the image of the fifth transfer and that $Tr^{\mathscr A}_5$ is an isomorphism in the bidegree
$(5, 5+(5(2^0-1) + 18.2^0)).$ This approach is different from the ones of Singer. In addition, the
behavior of $Tr^{\mathscr A}_5$ in the bidegree $(5, 5+(5(2^t-1) + 18.2^t))$ when $t\geq 1$ was
also discussed.

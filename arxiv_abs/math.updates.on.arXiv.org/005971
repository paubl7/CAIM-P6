We present tight bounds and heuristics for personalized, multi-product pricing problems. Under
mild conditions we show that the best price in the direction of a positive vector results in profits
that are guaranteed to be at least as large as a fraction of the profits from optimal personalized
pricing. For unconstrained problems, the fraction depends on the factor and on optimal price vectors
for the different customer types. For constrained problems the factor depends on the factor and
a ratio of the constraints. Using a factor vector with equal components results in uniform pricing
and has exceedingly mild sufficient conditions for the bound to hold. A robust factor is presented
that achieves the best possible performance guarantee. As an application, our model yields a tight
lower-bound on the performance of linear pricing relative to optimal personalized non-linear
pricing, and suggests effective non-linear price heuristics relative to personalized solutions.
Additionally, in the context of multi-product bundling pricing, we use our model and provide profit
guarantees for simple strategies such as bundle-size pricing and component-pricing with respect
to the optimal personalized mixed bundling solution. Heuristics to cluster customer types are
also developed with the goal of improving performance by allowing each cluster to price along its
own factor. Numerical results are presented for a variety of demand models that illustrate the tradeoffs
between using the economic factor and the robust factor for each cluster, as well as the tradeoffs
between using a clustering heuristic with a worst case performance of two and a machine learning
clustering algorithm. In our experiments economically motivated factors coupled with machine
learning clustering heuristics performed significantly better than other combinations.

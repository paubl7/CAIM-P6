This monograph introduces a framework for genuine proper equivariant stable homotopy theory for
Lie groups. The adjective `proper' alludes to the feature that equivalences are tested on compact
subgroups, and that the objects are built from equivariant cells with compact isotropy groups;
the adjective `genuine' indicates that the theory comes with appropriate transfers and Wirthm\"uller
isomorphisms, and the resulting equivariant cohomology theories support the analog of an $RO(G)$-grading.
Our model for genuine proper $G$-equivariant stable homotopy theory is the category of orthogonal
$G$-spectra; the equivalences are those morphisms that induce isomorphisms of equivariant stable
homotopy groups for all compact subgroups of $G$. This class of $\pi_*$-isomorphisms is part of
a symmetric monoidal stable model structure and the associated tensor triangulated homotopy category
is compactly generated. Every orthogonal $G$-spectrum represents an equivariant cohomology
theory on the category of $G$-spaces, depending only on the `proper $G$-homotopy type', tested
by fixed points under all compact subgroups. An important special case are infinite discrete groups.
For these, our genuine equivariant theory is related to finiteness properties, in the sense of geometric
group theory; for example, the $G$-sphere spectrum is a compact object in the equivariant homotopy
category if the universal space for proper $G$-actions has a finite $G$-CW-model. For discrete
groups, the represented equivariant cohomology theories on finite proper $G$-CW-complexes admit
a more explicit description in terms of parameterized equivariant homotopy theory, suitably stabilized
by $G$-vector bundles. Via this description, we can identify the previously defined $G$-cohomology
theories of equivariant stable cohomotopy and equivariant K-theory as cohomology theories represented
by specific orthogonal $G$-spectra.

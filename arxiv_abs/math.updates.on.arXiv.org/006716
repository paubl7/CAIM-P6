A random graph model on a host graph $H$ is said to be $1$-independent if for every pair of vertex-disjoint
subsets $A,B$ of $E(H)$, the state of edges (absent or present) in $A$ is independent of the state
of edges in $B$. For an infinite connected graph $H$, the $1$-independent critical percolation
probability $p_{1,c}(H)$ is the infimum of the $p\in [0,1]$ such that every $1$-independent random
graph model on $H$ in which each edge is present with probability at least $p$ almost surely contains
an infinite connected component. Balister and Bollob\'as observed in 2012 that $p_{1,c}(\mathbb{Z}^d)$
is nonincreasing and tends to a limit in $[\frac{1}{2}, 1]$ as $d\rightarrow \infty$. They asked
for the value of this limit. We make progress towards this question by showing that \[\lim_{n\rightarrow
\infty}p_{1,c}(\mathbb{Z}^2\times K_n)=4-2\sqrt{3}=0.5358\ldots \ .\] In fact, we show that
the equality above remains true if the sequence of complete graphs $K_n$ is replaced by a sequence
of weakly pseudorandom graphs on $n$ vertices with average degree $\omega(\log n)$. We conjecture
that the equality also remains true if $K_n$ is replaced instead by the $n$-dimensional hypercube
$Q_n$. This latter conjecture would imply the answer to Balister and Bollob\'as's question is $4-2\sqrt{3}$.
Using our results, we are also able to resolve a problem of Day, Hancock and the first author on the
emergence of long paths in $1$-independent random graph models on $\mathbb{Z}\times K_n$. Finally,
we prove some results on component evolution in $1$-independent random graphs, and discuss a number
of open problems arising from our work that may pave the way for further progress on the question of
Balister and Bollob\'as.

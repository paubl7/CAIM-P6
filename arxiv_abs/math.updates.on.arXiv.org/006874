Let $G$ be a graph $G$ whose largest independent set has size $m$. A permutation $\pi$ of $\{1, \ldots,
m\}$ is an {\em independent set permutation} of $G$ if $$ a_{\pi(1)}(G) \leq a_{\pi(2)}(G) \leq
\cdots \leq a_{\pi(m)}(G) $$ where $a_k(G)$ is the number of independent sets of size $k$ in $G$.
In 1987 Alavi, Malde, Schwenk and Erd\H{o}s proved that every permutation of $\{1, \ldots, m\}$
is an independent set permutation of some graph with $\alpha(G)=m$, i.e. with largest independent
set having size $m$. They raised the question of determining, for each $m$, the smallest number $f(m)$
such that every permutation of $\{1, \ldots, m\}$ is an independent set permutation of some graph
with $\alpha(G)=m$ and with at most $f(m)$ vertices, and they gave an upper bound on $f(m)$ of roughly
$m^{2m}$. Here we settle the question, determining $f(m)=m^m$, and make progress on a related question,
that of determining the smallest order such that every permutation of $\{1, \ldots, m\}$ is the {\em
unique} independent set permutation of some graph of at most that order. More generally we consider
an extension of independent set permutations to weak orders, and extend Alavi et al.'s main result
to show that every weak order on $\{1, \ldots, m\}$ can be realized by the independent set sequence
of some graph with $\alpha(G)=m$ and with at most $m^{m+2}$ vertices. Alavi et al. also considered
{\em matching permutations}, defined analogously to independent set permutations. They observed
that not every permutation of $\{1,\ldots,m\}$ is a matching permutation of some graph with largest
matching having size $m$, putting an upper bound of $2^{m-1}$ on the number of matching permutations
of $\{1,\ldots,m\}$. Confirming their speculation that this upper bound is not tight, we improve
it to $O(2^m/\sqrt{m})$.

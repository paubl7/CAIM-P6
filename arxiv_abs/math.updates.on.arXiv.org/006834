Depth induced multivariate medians (multi-dimensional maximum depth estimators) in regression
serve as robust alternatives to the traditional least squares and least absolute deviations estimators.
The induced median ($\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$) from regression depth (RD) of Rousseeuw and Hubert (1999)
(RH99) is one of the most prevailing estimators in regression. The maximum regression depth median
possesses outstanding robustness similar to the univariate location counterpart. Indeed, the
%maximum depth estimator induced from $\mbox{RD}$, $\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$ can, asymptotically,
resist up to $33\%$ contamination without breakdown, in contrast to the $0\%$ for the traditional
estimators %(i.e. they could break down by a single bad point) (see Van Aelst and Rousseeuw, 2000)
(VAR00). The results from VAR00 are pioneering and innovative, yet they are limited to regression
symmetric populations and the $\epsilon$-contamination and maximum bias model. With finite fixed
sample size practice, the most prevailing measure of robustness for estimators is the finite sample
breakdown point (FSBP) (Donoho (1982), Donoho and Huber (1983)). A lower bound (LB) of the FSBP for
the $\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$, which is not sharp, was given in RH99 (in a corollary of a conjecture).
An exact FSBP (or even a sharper LB) for the $\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$ remained open in the last two decades.
This article establishes a sharper lower and upper bounds of (and an exact) FSBP for the $\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$,
revealing an intrinsic connection between the regression depth of $\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$ and its
FSBP. This justifies the employment of the $\bs{\beta}^*_{RD}$ as a robust alternative to the traditional
estimators and demonstrating the necessity and the merit of using the FSBP in finite sample real
practice instead of an asymptotic breakdown value.

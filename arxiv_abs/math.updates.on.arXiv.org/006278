The space of tensors of metric curvature type on a Euclidean vector space carries a two-parameter
family of orthogonally invariant commutative nonassociative multiplications invariant with
respect to the symmetric bilinear form determined by the metric. For a particular choice of parameters
these algebras recover the polarization of the quadratic map on metric curvature tensors that arises
in the work of Hamilton on the Ricci flow. Here these algebras are studied as interesting examples
of metrized commutative algebras and in low dimensions they are described concretely in terms of
nonstandard commutative multiplications on self-adjoint endomorphisms. The algebra of curvature
tensors on a three-dimensional Euclidean vector space is shown isomorphic to an orthogonally invariant
deformation of the standard Jordan product on three by three symmetric matrices. This algebra is
characterized up to isomorphism in terms of purely algebraic properties of its idempotents and
the spectra of their multiplication operators. On a vector space of dimension at least four, the
subspace of Weyl (Ricci-flat) curvature tensors is a subalgebra for which the multiplication endomorphisms
are trace-free and the Killing type trace-form is a multiple of the nondegenerate invariant metric.
This subalgebra is simple when the Euclidean vector space has dimension greater than four. In the
presence of a compatible complex structure, the analogous result is obtained for the subalgebra
of K\"ahler Weyl curvature tensors. It is shown that the anti-self-dual Weyl tensors on a four-dimensional
vector space form a simple five-dimensional ideal isometrically isomorphic to the trace-free
part of the Jordan product on trace-free $3 \times 3$ symmetric matrices.

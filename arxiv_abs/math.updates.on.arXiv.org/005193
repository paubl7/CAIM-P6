This article establishes cutoff thermalization (also known as the cutoff phenomenon) for a general
class of general Ornstein-Uhlenbeck systems $(X^\epsilon_t(x))_{t\geq 0}$ under $\epsilon$-small
additive L\'evy noise with initial value $x$. The driving noise processes include Brownian motion,
$\alpha$-stable L\'evy flights, finite intensity compound Poisson processes and red noises and
may be highly degenerate. Window cutoff thermalization is shown under generic mild assumptions,
that is, we see an asymptotically sharp $\infty/0$-collapse of the renormalized Wasserstein distance
from the current state to the equilibrium measure $\mu^\epsilon$ along a time window centered in
a precise $\epsilon$-dependent time scale $\mathfrak{t}_\epsilon$. In many interesting situations
such as reversible (L\'evy) diffusions it is possible to prove the existence of an explicit, universal,
deterministic cutoff thermalization profile. That is, for generic initial data $x$ it holds the
stronger result $\mathcal{W}_p(X^\varepsilon_{\mathfrak{t}_\epsilon + r}(x), \mu^\varepsilon)
\cdot \epsilon^{-1} \rightarrow e^{-\mathfrak{q} r}, r\in \mathbb{R}$ as $\epsilon \rightarrow
0$ for some spectral constant $\mathfrak{q}>0$ and any $p\geq 1$ whenever the norm is finite. The
existence of this limit is characterized by the absence of non-normal growth patterns in terms of
an orthogonality condition on a computable family of generalized eigenvectors of $\mathcal{Q}$.
Precise error bounds are given. With this piece of theory at hand this article provides a complete
discussion of the cutoff phenomenon for the classical linear oscillator with friction subject
to $\epsilon$-small Brownian motion or $\alpha$-stable L\'evy flights. Furthermore, we cover
the highly degenerate case of a linear chain of oscillators in a generalized heat bath at low temperature.

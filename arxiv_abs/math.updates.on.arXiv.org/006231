Energy system models are challenged by the need for high temporal and spatial resolutions in or-der
to appropriately depict the increasing share of intermittent renewable energy sources, storage
technologies, and the growing interconnectivity across energy sectors. This study evaluates
methods for maintaining the computational viability of these models by ana-lyzing different temporal
aggregation techniques that reduce the number of time steps in their in-put time series. Two commonly-employed
approaches are the representation of time series by a subset of single (typical) time steps, or by
groups of consecutive time steps (typical periods). We test these techniques for two different
energy system models that are implemented using the Frame-work for Integrated Energy System Assessment
(FINE) by benchmarking the optimization results based on aggregation to those of the fully resolved
models and investigating whether the optimal aggregation method can, a priori, be determined based
on the clustering indicators. The results reveal that typical time steps consistenly outperform
typical days with respect to cluster-ing indicators, but do not lead to more accurate optimization
results when applied to a model that takes numerous storage technologies into account. Although
both aggregation techniques are ca-pable of coupling the aggregated time steps, typical days offer
more options to depict storage oper-ations, whereas typical time steps are more effective for models
that neglect time-linking con-straints. In summary, the adequate choice of aggregation methods
strongly depends on the mathematical structure of the considered energy system optimization model,
and a priori decisions of a sufficient temporal aggregation are only possible with good knowledge
of this mathematical structure.

This paper proposes an off-grid channel estimation scheme for orthogonal time-frequency space
(OTFS) systems adopting the sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) framework. To avoid channel spreading
caused by the fractional delay and Doppler shifts and to fully exploit the channel sparsity in the
delay-Doppler (DD) domain, we estimate the original DD domain channel response rather than the
effective DD domain channel response as commonly adopted in the literature. OTFS channel estimation
is first formulated as a one-dimensional (1D) off-grid sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem based
on a virtual sampling grid defined in the DD space, where the on-grid and off-grid components of the
delay and Doppler shifts are separated for estimation. In particular, the on-grid components of
the delay and Doppler shifts are jointly determined by the entry indices with significant values
in the recovered sparse vector. Then, the corresponding off-grid components are modeled as hyper-parameters
in the proposed SBL framework, which can be estimated via the expectation-maximization method.
To strike a balance between channel estimation performance and computational complexity, we further
propose a two-dimensional (2D) off-grid SSR problem via decoupling the delay and Doppler shift
estimations. In our developed 1D and 2D off-grid SBL-based channel estimation algorithms, the
hyper-parameters are updated alternatively for computing the conditional posterior distribution
of channels, which can be exploited to reconstruct the effective DD domain channel. Compared with
the 1D method, the proposed 2D method enjoys a much lower computational complexity while only suffers
slight performance degradation. Simulation results verify the superior performance of the proposed
channel estimation schemes over state-of-the-art schemes.

Homotopy comomentum maps are a higher generalization of the notion of moment map introduced to extend
the concept of Hamiltonian actions to the framework of multisymplectic geometry. Loosely speaking,
higher means passing from considering symplectic 2-form to consider differential forms in higher
degrees. The goal of this thesis is to provide new explicit constructions and concrete examples
related to group actions on multisymplectic manifolds admitting homotopy comomentum maps. The
first result is a complete classification of compact group actions on multisymplectic spheres.
The existence of a homotopy comomentum map about the latter depends on the dimension of the sphere
and the transitivity of the group action. Several concrete examples of such actions are also provided.
The second novel result is the explicit construction of the higher analogue of the embedding of the
Poisson algebra of a given symplectic manifold into the corresponding twisted Lie algebroid. It
is also proved a compatibility condition for such embedding for gauge-related multisymplectic
manifolds in presence of a compatible Hamiltonian group action. The latter construction could
play a role in determining the multisymplectic analogue of the geometric quantization procedure.
Finally, a concrete construction of a homotopy comomentum map for the action of the group of volume-preserving
diffeomorphisms on the multisymplectic 3-dimensional Euclidean space is proposed. This map can
be naturally related to hydrodynamics. For instance, it transgresses to the standard hydrodynamical
co-momentum map of Arnold, Marsden and Weinstein and others. A slight generalization of this construction
to a special class of Riemannian manifolds is also provided. The explicitly constructed homotopy
comomentum map can be also related to knot theory by virtue of the aforementioned hydrodynamical
interpretation.

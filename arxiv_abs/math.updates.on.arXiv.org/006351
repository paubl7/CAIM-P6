Bifurcation analysis has many applications in different scientific fields, such as electronics,
biology, ecology, and economics. In population biology, deterministic methods of bifurcation
are commonly used. In contrast, stochastic bifurcation techniques are infrequently employed.
Here we establish stochastic P-bifurcation behavior of (i) a growth model with state-dependent
birth rate and constant death rate, and (ii) a logistic growth model with state-dependent carrying
capacity, both of which are driven by multiplicative symmetric stable Levy noise. Transcritical
bifurcation occurs in the deterministic counterpart of the first model, while saddle-node bifurcation
takes place in the logistic growth model. We focus on the impact of the variations of the growth rate,
the per capita daily adult mortality rate, the stability index, and the noise intensity on the stationary
probability density functions of the associated non-local Fokker-Planck equation. In the first
model, the bifurcation parameter is the ratio of the population birth rate to the population death
rate. In the second model, the bifurcation parameter corresponds to the sensitivity of carrying
capacity to change in the size of the population near equilibrium. In each case, we show that as the
value of the bifurcation parameter increases, the shape of the steady-state probability density
function changes and that both stochastic models exhibit stochastic P-bifurcation. The unimodal
density functions become more peaked around deterministic equilibrium points as the stability
index increases. While an increase in any one of the other parameters has an effect on the stationary
probability density function. That means the geometry of the density function changes from unimodal
to flat, and its peak appears in the middle of the domain, which means a transition occurs.

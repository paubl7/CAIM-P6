We consider a $\mathscr C^\infty$ family of planar vector fields $\{X_{\hat\mu}\}_{\hat\mu\in\hat
W}$ having a hyperbolic saddle and we study the Dulac map $D(s;\hat\mu)$ and the Dulac time $T(s;\hat\mu)$
from a transverse section at the stable separatrix to a transverse section at the unstable separatrix,
both at arbitrary distance from the saddle. Since the hyperbolicity ratio $\lambda$ of the saddle
plays an important role, we consider it as an independent parameter, so that $\hat\mu=(\lambda,\mu)\in
\hat W=(0,+\infty)\times W$, where $W$ is an open subset of $\mathbb R^N.$ For each $\hat\mu_0\in\hat
W$ and $L>0$, the functions $D(s;\hat\mu)$ and $T(s;\hat\mu)$ have an asymptotic expansion at
$s=0$ and $\hat\mu\approx\hat\mu_0$ with the remainder being uniformly $L$-flat with respect
to the parameters. The principal part of both asymptotic expansions is given in a monomial scale
containing a deformation of the logarithm, the so-called Ecalle-Roussarie compensator. In this
paper we are interested in the coefficients of these monomials, which are functions depending on
$\hat\mu$ that can be shown to be $\mathscr C^\infty$ in their respective domains and "universally"
defined, meaning that their existence is stablished before fixing the flatness $L$ and the unfolded
parameter $\hat\mu_0.$ Each coefficient has its own domain and it is of the form $((0,+\infty)\setminus
D)\times W$, where~$D$ a discrete set of rational numbers at which a resonance of the hyperbolicity
ratio $\lambda$ occurs. In our main result we give the explicit expression of some of these coefficients
and to this end a fundamental tool is the employment of a sort of incomplete Mellin transform. With
regard to these coefficients we also prove that they have poles of order at most two at $D\times W$
and we give the corresponding residue, that plays an important role when compensators appear in
the principal part.

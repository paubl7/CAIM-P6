This paper examines a class of PDEs where some part of the PDE system evolves a vector field whose curl
remains zero or grows in proportion to specified source terms. Such PDEs are referred to as curl-free
or curl-preserving respectively. In this paper we catalogue a class of DG-like schemes for such
PDEs. To retain the globally curl-free or curl-preserving constraints, the components of the vector
field, as well as their higher moments, have to be collocated at the edges of the mesh. They are updated
by using potentials that are collocated at the vertices of the mesh. The resulting schemes : 1) do
not blow up even after very long integration times, 2) do not need any special cleaning treatment,
3) can operate with large explicit timesteps, 4) do not require the solution of an elliptic system
and 5) can be extended to higher orders using DG-like methods. The methods rely on a special curl-preserving
reconstruction and they also rely on multidimensional upwinding. The Galerkin projection, so
crucial to the design of a DG method, is now carried out in the edges of the mesh and yields a weak form
update that uses potentials that are obtained at the vertices of the mesh with the help of a multidimensional
Riemann solver. A von Neumann stability analysis of the curl-preserving methods is carried out
and the limiting CFL numbers of this entire family of methods is catalogued in this work. The stability
analysis confirms that with increasing order of accuracy, our novel curl-free methods have superlative
phase accuracy while substantially reducing dissipation. We also show that PNPM-like methods
retain much of the excellent wave propagation characteristics of the DG-like methods while offering
a much larger CFL number and lower computational complexity.

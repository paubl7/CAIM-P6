Haj\'os conjectured that every graph containing no subdivision of the complete graph $K_{s+1}$
is properly $s$-colorable. This conjecture was disproved by Catlin. Indeed, the maximum chromatic
number of such graphs is $\Omega(s^2/\log s)$. We prove that $O(s)$ colors are enough for a weakening
of this conjecture that only requires every monochromatic component to have bounded size (so-called
\emph{clustered} coloring). Our approach leads to more results. Say that a graph is an {\it almost
$(\leq 1)$-subdivision} of a graph $H$ if it can be obtained from $H$ by subdividing edges, where
at most one edge is subdivided more than once. Note that every graph with no $H$-subdivision does
not contain an almost $(\leq 1)$-subdivision of $H$. We prove the following (where $s \geq 2$): (1)
Graphs of bounded treewidth and with no almost $(\leq 1)$-subdivision of $K_{s+1}$ are $s$-choosable
with bounded clustering. (2) For every graph $H$, graphs with no $H$-minor and no almost $(\leq 1)$-subdivision
of $K_{s+1}$ are $(s+1)$-colorable with bounded clustering. (3) For every graph $H$ of maximum
degree at most $d$, graphs with no $H$-subdivision and no almost $(\leq 1)$-subdivision of $K_{s+1}$
are $\max\{s+3d-5,2\}$-colorable with bounded clustering. (4) For every graph $H$ of maximum
degree $d$, graphs with no $K_{s,t}$ subgraph and no $H$-subdivision are $\max\{s+3d-4,2\}$-colorable
with bounded clustering. (5) Graphs with no $K_{s+1}$-subdivision are $(4s-5)$-colorable with
bounded clustering. The first result shows that the weakening of Haj\'{o}s' conjecture is true
for graphs of bounded treewidth in a stronger sense; the final result is the first $O(s)$ bound on
the clustered chromatic number of graphs with no $K_{s+1}$-subdivision.

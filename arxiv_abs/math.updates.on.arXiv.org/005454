The achievable rate of existing wireless systems is commonly studied based on mathematical models
that disregard the physical limitations of antennas in terms of size, bandwidth, and efficiency.
Antenna models are indeed essential to properly analyze the achievable rate as a key performance
metric of wireless communication systems. In this work, we use ideas from Chu and Bode/Fano theories
to establish the achievable rate under antenna-size constraint. Specifically, we characterize
the maximum achievable rate over single-input single-output (SISO) wireless communication channels
under a restriction on the antenna size at the receiver. By employing circuit-theoretic multiport
models for radio communication systems, we derive the information-theoretic limits of compact
antennas. We first describe an equivalent Chu's antenna circuit under the physical realizability
conditions of its reflection coefficient. Such a design allows us to subsequently compute the achievable
rate for a given size of the receive antenna thereby providing a realistic upper-bound on the system
performance that we compare to the standard size-unconstrained Shannon capacity. We also determine
the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) which strongly depends on the antenna size and experiences
an apparent finite-size performance degradation where only a small fraction of Shannon capacity
can be achieved. We further determine the optimal signaling bandwidth which shows that impedance
matching is essential in bandwidth-limited scenarios. We also examine the achievable rate in presence
of interference showing that the size constraint is immaterial in interference-limited scenarios.
Finally, our numerical results of the derived achievable rate as a function of the antenna size and
the SNR reveal new insights into concepts for the physical design of radio systems.

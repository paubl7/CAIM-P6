We investigate polytopes inscribed into a sphere that are normally equivalent to a given polytope
$P$. We show that the associated space of polytopes, called the inscribed cone of $P$, is closed under
Minkowski addition. Inscribed cones are interpreted as type cones of ideal hyperbolic polytopes
and as deformation spaces of Delaunay subdivisions. In particular, testing if there is an inscribed
polytope normally equivalent to $P$ is polynomial time solvable. Normal equivalence is decided
on the level of normal fans and we study the structure of inscribed cones for various classes of polytopes
and fans, including simple, simplicial, and even. We classify (virtually) inscribable fans in
dimension $2$ as well as inscribable permutahedra and nestohedra. A second goal of the paper is to
introduce inscribed virtual polytopes. Polytopes with a fixed normal fan $\mathcal{N}$ form a
monoid with respect to Minkowski addition and the associated Grothendieck group is called the type
space of $\mathcal{N}$. Elements of the type space correspond to formal Minkowski differences
and are naturally equipped with vertices and hence with a notion of inscribability. We show that
inscribed virtual polytopes form a subgroup, which can be nontrivial even if $\mathcal{N}$ does
not have actual inscribed polytopes. We relate inscribed virtual polytopes to routed particle
trajectories, that is, piecewise linear trajectories of particles in a ball with restricted directions.
The state spaces gives rise to connected groupoids generated by reflections, called reflection
groupoids. The endomorphism groups of reflection groupoids can be thought of as discrete holonomy
groups of the trajectories and we determine when they are reflection groups.

When a differential field $K$ having $n$ commuting derivations is given together with two finitely
generated differential extensions $L$ and $M$ of $K$, an important problem in differential algebra
is to exhibit a common differential extension $N$ in order to define the new differential extensions
$L\cap M$ and the smallest differential field $(L,M)\subset N$ containing both $L$ and $M$. Such
a result allows to generalize the use of complex numbers in classical algebra. Having now two finitely
generated differential modules $L$ and $M$ over the non-commutative ring ring $D=K[d_1,... ,d_n]=K[d]$
of differential operators with coefficients in $K$, we may similarly look for a differential module
$N$ containing both $L$ and $M$ in order to define $L\cap M$ and $L+M$. This is {\it exactly} the situation
met in linear or non-linear OD or PD control theory by selecting the inputs and the outputs among the
control variables. However, in many recent books and papers, we have shown that controllability
was a {\it built-in} property of a control system, not depending on the choice of inputs and outputs.
The main purpose of this paper is to revisit control theory by showing the specific importance of
the two previous problems and the part plaid by $N$ in both cases for the parametrization of the control
system. The essential tool will be the study of {\it differential correspondences}, a modern name
for what was called {\it B\"{a}cklund problem} during the last century, namely the study of elimination
theory for groups of variables among systems of linear or nonlinear OD or PD equations. The difficulty
is to revisit {\it differential homological algebra} by using non-commutative localization.
Finally, when $M$ is a $D$-module, this paper is using for the first time the fact that the system $R=hom_K(M,K)$
is a $D$-module for the Spencer operator acting on sections.

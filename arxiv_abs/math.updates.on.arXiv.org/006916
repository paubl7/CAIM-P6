The Restricted 3-Body Problem models the motion of a body of negligible mass under the gravitational
influence of two massive bodies, called the primaries. If the primaries perform circular motions
and the massless body is coplanar with them, one has the Restricted Planar Circular 3-Body Problem
(RPC3BP). In synodic coordinates, it is a two degrees of freedom Hamiltonian system with five critical
points, L1,..,L5, called the Lagrange points. The Lagrange point L3 is a saddle-center critical
point which is collinear with the primaries and is located beyond the largest of the two. In this paper
and its sequel, we provide an asymptotic formula for the distance between the one dimensional stable
and unstable invariant manifolds of L3 when the ratio between the masses of the primaries $\mu$ is
small. It implies that L3 cannot have one-round homoclinic orbits. If the mass ratio $\mu$ is small,
the hyperbolic eigenvalues are weaker than the elliptic ones by factor of order $\sqrt{\mu}$. This
implies that the distance between the invariant manifolds is exponentially small with respect
to $\mu$ and, therefore, the classical Poincar\'e--Melnikov method cannot be applied. In this
first paper, we approximate the RPC3BP by an averaged integrable Hamiltonian system which possesses
a saddle center with a homoclinic orbit and we analyze the complex singularities of its time parameterization.
We also derive and study the inner equation associated to the original perturbed problem. The difference
between certain solutions of the inner equation gives the leading term of the distance between the
stable and unstable manifolds of L3. In the sequel we complete the proof of the asymptotic formula
for the distance between the invariant manifolds.

In this paper, we introduce an application of a high-performance MultiPeriod AC Optimal Power Flow
(MPOPF) solver, called "BATTPOWER", to simulate active distribution grids for a near-future scenario.
A large-scale Norwegian distribution grid along with a large population of Electric Vehicles (EV)
are here taken as the case-study. We suggest and analyse three operational strategies (in terms
of control of charge scheduling fleet of EV) for the Distribution System Operator (DSO): (a) uncoordinated/dumb
charge scheduling, (b) coordinated charge scheduling with the objective of energy cost-minimisation
without operational constraints of the grid, and (c) coordinated charge scheduling with the objective
of energy cost-minimisation along with the operational constraints of the grid. The results demonstrate
that the uncoordinated charging would lead to: 1) overloading of lines and transformers when the
share of EVs is above 20%, and 2) higher operational costs than the proposed control strategies of
(b) and (c). In strategy (b) operational line/transformer limits are violated when the populations
of EVs are growing above 36%. This implies that current market design must be altered to allow active
control of a large proportion of DERs within grid operational limits to achieve cost minimization
at system level. To our knowledge, the work presented in this paper is the first ever attempt to do
a comprehensive analysis of the impact of EV charging demand on a real Norwegian distribution grid.
Moreover, the inference of the analysis says that the Norwegian distribution networks are more
prone to congestion problems than the voltage problems for the EV demand which includes a smart charging
scheme accounting for grid conditions.

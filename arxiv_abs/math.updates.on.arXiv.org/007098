In a recent joint work, the author has developed a modification of Newton's method, named New Q-Newton's
method, which can avoid saddle points and has quadratic rate of convergence. While good theoretical
convergence guarantee has not been established for this method, experiments on small scale problems
show that the method works very competitively against other well known modifications of Newton's
method such as Adaptive Cubic Regularization and BFGS, as well as first order methods such as Unbounded
Two-way Backtracking Gradient Descent. In this paper, we resolve the convergence guarantee issue
by proposing a modification of New Q-Newton's method, named New Q-Newton's method Backtracking,
which incorporates a more sophisticated use of hyperparameters and a Backtracking line search.
This new method has very good theoretical guarantees, which for a {\bf Morse function} yields the
following (which is unknown for New Q-Newton's method): {\bf Theorem.} Let $f:\mathbb{R}^m\rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$ be a Morse function, that is all its critical points have invertible Hessian. Then for
a sequence $\{x_n\}$ constructed by New Q-Newton's method Backtracking from a random initial point
$x_0$, we have the following two alternatives: i) $\lim _{n\rightarrow\infty}||x_n||=\infty$,
or ii) $\{x_n\}$ converges to a point $x_{\infty}$ which is a {\bf local minimum} of $f$, and the rate
of convergence is {\bf quadratic}. Moreover, if $f$ has compact sublevels, then only case ii) happens.
As far as we know, for Morse functions, this is the best theoretical guarantee for iterative optimization
algorithms so far in the literature. We have tested in experiments on small scale, with some further
simplified versions of New Q-Newton's method Backtracking, and found that the new method significantly
improve New Q-Newton's method.

The two dimensional Hasegawa-Mima equation describes the time evolution of drift waves in a magnetically-confined
plasma. The main difficulty of the model resides in the third-order non-linear differential term
defined using Poisson's bracket, $\{u,\Delta u\}:=u_x\Delta u_u-u_y\Delta u_x $. Several authors
have treated, theoretically and numerically, the Hasegawa-Mima PDE using its original scalar
form: $-\Delta u_t+u_t = \{u,\Delta u\} + ku_y$ with difficulties arising when handling the non-linear
Poisson's bracket. In this paper, we introduce a new approach that avoids the Poisson's bracket
term by reformulating the non-linear Hasegawa-Mima initial-value plasma equation as a coupled
system of two linear PDEs, a solution of which is a pair $(u,w)$, with $w=(I-\Delta)u$. The first
equation in the system is a wave equation of hyperbolic type and the second is of elliptic type. Based
on the coupled hyperbolic-elliptic system, we derive several variational frames, all propitious
for finding weak solutions to the initial-value Hasegawa-Mima coupled system with spacial periodic
boundary conditions and minimal regularity assumptions on the initial data. More specifically,
for initial data $u_0 \in H_P^2$ with $w_0:=(I-\Delta) u_0$, we prove the existence of a weak solution
that is global in time. And for initial data $u_0 \in H_P^3$ with $w_0:=(I-\Delta) u_0 \in L^\infty$,
we prove the existence of a strong solution that is local in time. Our proofs are based on spectral
fixed-point solutions $\{(u_N,w_N)\}$ to Petrov-Galerkin Hasegawa-Mima systems, constructed
using a spacial Fourier basis. Through compactness arguments with appropriate a priori estimates,
we reach to limit point solutions $(u,w)$ when $N\to\infty$.

Let $G$ be a complex reductive algebraic group. In this paper, we give a geometric definition of a
unipotent representation of $G$. Our definition generalizes the notion of a special unipotent
representation, due to Barbasch-Vogan and Arthur. The representations we define arise from finite
equivariant covers of nilpotent co-adjoint $G$-orbits. To each such cover $\tilde{\mathbb{O}}$,
we attach a distinguished filtered algebra $\mathcal{A}_0$ equipped with a graded Poisson isomorphism
$\mathrm{gr}(\mathcal{A}_0)\simeq \mathbb{C}[\tilde{\mathbb{O}}]$. The algebra $\mathcal{A}_0$
receives a distinguished homomorphism from the universal enveloping algebra $U(\mathfrak{g})$,
and the kernel of this homomorphism is a completely prime primitive ideal in $U(\mathfrak{g})$
with associated variety $\overline{\mathbb{O}}$. A unipotent ideal is any ideal in $U(\mathfrak{g})$
which arises in this fashion. A unipotent representation is an irreducible Harish-Chandra bimodule
which is annihilated (on both sides) by such an ideal. Our unipotent ideals and representations
have all of the expected properties: the unipotent representations attached to $\tilde{\mathbb{O}}$
are parameterized by irreducible representations of a certain finite group (generalizing Lusztig's
canonical quotient) and, when restricted to $K$, are of the form conjectured by Vogan. In classical
types, all unipotent ideals are maximal, and all unipotent representations are unitary (we expect
these properties to hold for arbitrary groups). Finally, all special unipotent representations
are unipotent. To prove the last assertion, we introduce a refinement of Barbasch-Vogan-Lusztig-Spaltenstein
duality, inspired by the symplectic duality of Braden, Licata, Proudfoot, and Webster.

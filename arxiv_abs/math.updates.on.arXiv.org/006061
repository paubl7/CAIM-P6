This work proves rigorous results about the vanishing-mass limit of the classical problem to find
a shape with minimal elastic compliance. Contrary to all previous results in the mathematical literature,
which utilize a soft mass constraint by introducing a Lagrange multiplier, we here consider the
hard mass constraint. Our results are the first to establish the convergence of approximately optimal
shapes of (exact) size $\varepsilon \downarrow 0$ to a limit generalized shape represented by a
(possibly diffuse) probability measure. This limit generalized shape is a minimizer of the limit
compliance, which involves a new integrand, namely the one conjectured by Bouchitt\'e in 2001 and
predicted heuristically before in works of Allaire & Kohn and Kohn & Strang from the 1980s and 1990s.
This integrand gives the energy of the limit generalized shape understood as a fine oscillation
of (optimal) lower-dimensional structures. Its appearance is surprising since the integrand
in the original compliance is just a quadratic form and the non-convexity of the problem is not immediately
obvious. In fact, it is the interaction of the mass constraint with the requirement of attaining
the loading (in the form of a divergence-constraint) that gives rise to this new integrand. We also
present connections to the theory of Michell trusses, first formulated in 1904, and show how our
results can be interpreted as a rigorous justification of that theory on the level of functionals
in both two and three dimensions, finally settling this long-standing open problem. Our proofs
rest on compensated compactness arguments applied to an explicit family of (symmetric) div-quasiconvex
quadratic forms, computations involving the Hashin-Shtrikman bounds for the Kohn-Strang integrand,
and the characterization of limit minimizers due to Bouchitt\'e & Buttazzo.

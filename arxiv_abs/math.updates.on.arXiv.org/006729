Massive access is a critical design challenge of Internet of Things (IoT) networks. In this paper,
we consider the grant-free uplink transmission of an IoT network with a multiple-antenna base station
(BS) and a large number of single-antenna IoT devices. Taking into account the sporadic nature of
IoT devices, we formulate the joint activity detection and channel estimation (JADCE) problem
as a group-sparse matrix estimation problem. This problem can be solved by applying the existing
compressed sensing techniques, which however either suffer from high computational complexities
or lack of algorithm robustness. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm unrolling framework based
on the deep neural network to simultaneously achieve low computational complexity and high robustness
for solving the JADCE problem. Specifically, we map the original iterative shrinkage thresholding
algorithm (ISTA) into an unrolled recurrent neural network (RNN), thereby improving the convergence
rate and computational efficiency through end-to-end training. Moreover, the proposed algorithm
unrolling approach inherits the structure and domain knowledge of the ISTA, thereby maintaining
the algorithm robustness, which can handle non-Gaussian preamble sequence matrix in massive access.
With rigorous theoretical analysis, we further simplify the unrolled network structure by reducing
the redundant training parameters. Furthermore, we prove that the simplified unrolled deep neural
network structures enjoy a linear convergence rate. Extensive simulations based on various preamble
signatures show that the proposed unrolled networks outperform the existing methods in terms of
the convergence rate, robustness and estimation accuracy.

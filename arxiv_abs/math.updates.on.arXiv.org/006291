This paper studies the Graph-Connected Clique-Partitioning Problem (GCCP), a clustering optimization
model in which units are characterized by both individual and relational data. This problem, introduced
by Benati et al. (2017) under the name of Connected Partitioning Problem, shows that the combination
of the two data types improves the clustering quality in comparison with other methodologies. Nevertheless,
the resulting optimization problem is difficult to solve; only small-sized instances can be solved
exactly, large-sized instances require the application of heuristic algorithms. In this paper
we improve the exact and the heuristic algorithms previously proposed. Here, we provide a new Integer
Linear Programming (ILP) formulation, that solves larger instances, but at the cost of using an
exponential number of variables. In order to limit the number of variables necessary to calculate
the optimum, the new ILP formulation is solved implementing a branch-and-price algorithm. The
resulting pricing problem is itself a new combinatorial model: the Maximum-weighted Graph-Connected
Single-Clique problem (MGCSC), that we solve testing various Mixed Integer Linear Programming
(MILP) formulations and proposing a new fast "random shrink" heuristic. In this way, we are able
to improve the previous algorithms: The branch-and-price method outperforms the computational
times of the previous MILP algorithms and the new random shrink heuristic, when applied to GCCP,
is both faster and more accurate than the previous heuristic methods. Moreover, the combination
of column generation and random shrink is itself a new MILP-relaxed matheuristic that can be applied
to large instances too. Its main advantage is that all heuristic local optima are combined together
in a restricted MILP, consisting in the application of the exact branch-and-price method but solving
heuristically the pricing problem.

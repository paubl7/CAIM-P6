Guaranteeing the quality of transit service is of great importance to promote the attractiveness
of buses and alleviate urban traffic issues such as congestion and pollution. Emerging technologies
of automated driving and V2X communication have the potential to enable the accurate control of
vehicles and the efficient organization of traffic to enhance both the schedule adherence of buses
and the overall network mobility. This study proposes an innovative network-level control scheme
for heterogeneous automated traffic composed of buses and private cars under a full connected and
automated environment. Inheriting the idea of network-level rhythmic control proposed by Lin
et al. (2020), an augmented rhythmic control scheme for heterogeneous traffic, i.e., RC-H, is established
to organize the mixed traffic in a rhythmic manner. Realized virtual platoons are designed for accommodating
vehicles to pass through the network, including dedicated virtual platoons for buses to provide
exclusive right-of-ways (ROWs) on their trips and regular virtual platoons for private cars along
with an optimal assignment plan to minimize the total travel cost. A mixed-integer linear program
(MILP) is formulated to optimize the RC-H scheme and a bilevel heuristic solution method is designed
to relieve the computational burden of MILP. Numerical examples and simulation experiments are
conducted to evaluate the performance of the RC-H scheme under different scenarios. The results
show that the bus operation can be guaranteed and the travel delay can be minimized under various
demand levels with transit priority. Moreover, compared with traffic signal control strategies,
the RC-H scheme has significant advantages in handling massive traffic demand, in terms of both
vehicle delay and network throughput.

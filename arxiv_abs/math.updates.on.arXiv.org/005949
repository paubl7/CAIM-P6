One of the open problems in Algebraic topology is the "hit" problem for a module over the Steenrod
ring $\mathscr A$. More specifically, the problem asks a minimal set of generators for the polynomial
algebra $\mathcal P_m:=\mathbb F_2[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m]$ regarded as a connected unstable $\mathscr
A$-module on $m$ variables $x_1, \ldots, x_m,$ each of degree one. The algebra $\mathcal P_m$ is
the cohomology with $\mathbb F_2$-coefficients of the product of $m$ copies of the Eilenberg-MacLan
space of type $(\mathbb F_2, 1).$ The hit problem has been thoroughly studied for 35 years in a variety
of contexts by many authors and completely solved for $m\leq 4.$ Furthermore, it is applied in studying
the cohomology of $\mathscr A$ via the $m$-th Singer algebraic transfer $Tr_m$. The aim of this work
is to continue our study of the hit problem of five variables. At the same time, applying this result
into the investigation of the fifth Singer transfer map. More precisely, we extend our result in
[26] on the hit problem for $\mathscr A$-module $\mathcal P_5$ in the "generic" degree $5(2^t-1)
+ 18.2^t$ with $t\geq 0.$ This result confirms a conjecture of Sum [36] on the relation between the
minimal set of $\mathscr A$-generators for the polynomial algebras $\mathcal P_5$ and $\mathcal
P_{4}$ in the above degree. Moreover, by using our result [26] and a presentation in the Lambda algebra
of $Tr_5^{\mathscr A}$, we show that the non-trivial element $h_1e_0 = h_0f_0\in {\rm Ext}_{\mathscr
A}^{5, 5+(5(2^0-1) + 18.2^0)}(\mathbb F_2, \mathbb F_2)$ is in the image of the fifth transfer and
that $Tr^{\mathscr A}_5$ is an isomorphism in the bidegree $(5, 5+(5(2^0-1) + 18.2^0)).$ This approach
is different from the ones of Singer. In addition, the behavior of $Tr^{\mathscr A}_5$ in the bidegree
$(5, 5+(5(2^t-1) + 18.2^t))$ when $t\geq 1$ was also discussed.

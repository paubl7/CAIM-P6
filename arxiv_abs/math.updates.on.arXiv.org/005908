The main topic of this thesis is the analysis of evolution equations reflecting issues in ecology
and population dynamics. In mathematical modelling, the impact of environmental elements and
the interaction between species is read into the role of heterogeneity in equations and interactions
in coupled systems. In this direction, we investigate three separate problems, each corresponding
to a chapter of this thesis. The first problem addresses the evolution of a single population living
in a periodic medium with a fast diffusion line; this corresponds to the study of a reaction-diffusion
system with equations in different dimensions. We derive results on asymptotic behaviour through
the study of some generalised principal eigenvalues. We find that the road has no impact on the survival
chances of the population, despite the deleterious effect expected from fragmentation. The second
investigation regards a model describing the competition between two populations in a situation
of asymmetrically aggressive interactions; this consists of a system of two ODEs. The evolution
progresses through two possible scenarios, where only one population survives. Then, the interpretation
of one of the parameters as the aggressiveness of the attacker population naturally raises questions
of controllability. We characterise the set of initial conditions leading to the victory of the
attacker through a suitable (possibly time-dependant) strategy. The third and last part of this
thesis analyses the time decay of some evolution equations with classical and fractional time derivatives.
Depending on the type of derivative and some degree of non-degeneracy of the spatial operator, quantitative
polynomial or exponential estimates are entailed.

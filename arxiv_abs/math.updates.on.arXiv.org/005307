Any totally positive $(k+m)\times n$ matrix induces a map $\pi_+$ from the positive Grassmannian
$\Gr_+(k,n)$ to $\Gr(k,k+m)$, whose image is the amplituhedron $\A_{n,k,m}$ and is endowed with
a top-degree form called the canonical form ${\bf\Omega}(\A_{n,k,m})$. This construction was
introduced by Arkani-Hamed and Trnka, where they showed that ${\bf\Omega}(\A_{n,k,4})$ encodes
scattering amplitudes in $\mathcal{N}=4$ super Yang-Mills theory. Moreover, the computation
of ${\bf\Omega}(\A_{n,k,m})$ is reduced to finding the triangulations of $\A_{n,k,m}$. However,
while triangulations of polytopes are fully captured by their secondary and fiber polytopes, the
study of triangulations of objects beyond polytopes is still underdeveloped. We initiate the geometric
study of subdivisions of $\A_{n,k,m}$ in order to establish the notion of secondary amplituhedron.
For this purpose, we provide a concrete birational parametrization of fibers of the projection
$\pi: \Gr(k,n)\dasharrow \mathcal{A}_{n,k,m}$. We then use this to explicitly describe a rational
top-degree form $\omega_{n,k,m}$ (with simple poles) on the fibers and compute ${\bf\Omega}(\A_{n,k,m})$
as a summation of certain residues of $\omega_{n,k,m}$. As main application of our approach, we
develop a well-structured notion of secondary amplituhedra for conjugate to polytopes, i.e.~when
$n-k-1=m$. We show that, in this case, each fiber of $\pi$ is parameterized by a projective space
and its volume form $\omega_{n,k,m}$ has only poles on a hyperplane arrangement. Using such linear
structures, for amplituhedra which are cyclic polytopes or conjugate to polytopes, we show that
the Jeffrey-Kirwan residue computes ${\bf\Omega}(\A_{n,k,m})$ from the fiber volume form $\omega_{n,k,m}$.
Finally, we propose a more general framework of fiber positive geometries and analyze new families
of examples such as fiber and Grassmann polytopes.

Purpose: To simulate the intravoxel incoherent perfusion magnetic resonance magnitude signal
from the motion of blood particles in three realistic vascular network graphs from a mouse brain.
Methods: In three networks generated from the cortex of a mouse scanned by two-photon laser microscopy,
blood flow in each vessel was simulated using Poiseuille law. The trajectories, flow speeds and
phases acquired by a fixed number of simulated blood particles during a Stejskal-Tanner monopolar
pulse gradient scheme were computed. The resulting magnitude signal as a function of b-value was
obtained by integrating all phases and the pseudo-diffusion coefficient D* was estimated by fitting
an exponential signal decay. To better understand the anatomical source of the IVIM perfusion signal,
the above was repeated by restricting the simulation to various types of vessels. Results: The characteristics
of the three microvascular networks were respectively: vessel lengths [mean +/- std. dev.]: 67.2
+/- 53.6 um, 59.8 +/- 46.2 um, and 64.5 +/- 50.9 um; diameters: 6.0 +/- 3.5 um, network 2: 5.7 +/- 3.6
um, and network 3: 6.1 +/- 3.7 um; simulated blood velocity: 0.9 +/- 1.7 um/ms, 1.4 +/- 2.5 um/ms and
0.7 +/- 2.1 um/ms. Exponential fitting of the simulated signal decay as a function of b-value resulted
in the following D* [10-3 mm2/s]: 31.7, 40.4 and 33.4. The signal decay for low b-values was the largest
in the larger vessels, but the smaller vessels and the capillaries accounted more to the total volume
of the networks. Conclusion:This simulation improves the theoretical understanding of the IVIM
perfusion estimation method by directly linking the MR IVIM perfusion signal to an ultra-high resolution
measurement of the microvascular network and a realistic blood flow simulation.

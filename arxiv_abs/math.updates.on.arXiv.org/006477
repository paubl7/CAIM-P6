We study certain physically-relevant subgeometries of binary symplectic polar spaces $W(2N-1,2)$
of small rank $N$, when the points of these spaces canonically encode $N$-qubit observables. Key
characteristics of a subspace of such a space $W(2N-1,2)$ are: the number of its negative lines,
the distribution of types of observables, the character of the geometric hyperplane the subspace
shares with the distinguished (non-singular) quadric of $W(2N-1,2)$ and the structure of its Veldkamp
space. In particular, we classify and count polar subspaces of $W(2N-1,2)$ whose rank is $N-1$.
$W(3,2)$ features three negative lines of the same type and its $W(1,2)$'s are of five different
types. $W(5,2)$ is endowed with 90 negative lines of two types and its $W(3,2)$'s split into 13 types.
279 out of 480 $W(3,2)$'s with three negative lines are composite, i.e. they all originate from the
two-qubit $W(3,2)$ by selecting in the latter a geometric hyperplane and formally adding to each
two-qubit observable, at the same position, the identity matrix if this observable lies on the hyperplane,
and the same Pauli matrix for any other observable. Further, given a $W(3,2)$ and any of its geometric
hyperplanes, there are three other $W(3,2)$'s possessing the same hyperplane. There is also a particular
type of $W(3,2)$'s, a representative of which features a point each line through which is negative.
Finally, $W(7,2)$ is found to possess 1908 negative lines of five types and its $W(5,2)$'s fall into
as many as 29 types. 1524 out of 1560 $W(5,2)$'s with 90 negative lines originate from the three-qubit
$W(5,2)$. Remarkably, the difference in the number of negative lines for any two distinct types
of four-qubit $W(5,2)$'s is a multiple of four.

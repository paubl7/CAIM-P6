In [A dozen de {F}inetti-style results in search of a theory, Ann. Inst. H. Poincar\'{e} Probab.
Statist. 23(2)(1987), 397--423], Diaconis and Freedman studied low-dimensional projections
of random vectors from the Euclidean unit sphere and the simplex in high dimensions, noting that
the individual coordinates of these random vectors look like Gaussian and exponential random variables
respectively. In subsequent works, Rachev and R\"uschendorf and Naor and Romik unified these results
by establishing a connection between $\ell_p^N$ balls and a $p$-generalized Gaussian distribution.
In this paper, we study similar questions in a significantly generalized and unifying setting,
looking at low-dimensional projections of random vectors uniformly distributed on sets of the
form \[B_{\phi,t}^N := \Big\{(s_1,\ldots,s_N)\in\mathbb{R}^N : \sum_{ i =1}^N\phi(s_i)\leq
t N\Big\},\] where $\phi:\mathbb{R}\to [0,\infty]$ is a potential (including the case of Orlicz
functions). Our method is different from both Rachev-R\"uschendorf and Naor-Romik, based on a
large deviation perspective in the form of quantitative versions of Cram\'er's theorem and the
Gibbs conditioning principle, providing a natural framework beyond the $p$-generalized Gaussian
distribution while simultaneously unraveling the role this distribution plays in relation to
the geometry of $\ell_p^N$ balls. We find that there is a critical parameter $t_{\mathrm{crit}}$
at which there is a phase transition in the behaviour of the projections: for $t > t_{\mathrm{crit}}$
the coordinates of random points sampled from $B_{\phi,t}^N$ behave like uniform random variables,
but for $t \leq t_{\mathrm{crit}}$ the Gibbs conditioning principle comes into play, and here there
is a parameter $\beta_t>0$ (the inverse temperature) such that the coordinates are approximately
distributed according to a density proportional to $e^{ -\beta_t\phi(s)}$.

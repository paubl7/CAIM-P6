The prediction of crack initiation and propagation in ductile failure processes are challenging
tasks for the design and fabrication of metallic materials and structures on a large scale. Numerical
aspects of ductile failure dictate a sub-optimal calibration of plasticity- and fracture-related
parameters for a large number of material properties. These parameters enter the system of partial
differential equations as a forward model. In this work, we develop a step-wise Bayesian inversion
framework for ductile fracture to provide accurate knowledge regarding the effective mechanical
parameters. To this end, synthetic and experimental observations are used to estimate the posterior
density of the unknowns. To model the ductile failure behavior of solid materials, we rely on the
phase-field approach to fracture, for which we present a unified formulation that allows recovering
different models on a variational basis. In the variational framework, incremental minimization
principles for a class of gradient-type dissipative materials are used to derive the governing
equations. The overall formulation is revisited and extended to the case of anisotropic ductile
fracture. Three different models are subsequently recovered by certain choices of parameters
and constitutive functions, which are later assessed through Bayesian inversion techniques.
To estimate the posterior density function of ductile material parameters, three common Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques are employed: (i) the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, (ii)
delayed-rejection adaptive Metropolis, and (iii) ensemble Kalman filter combined with MCMC.
To examine the computational efficiency of the MCMC methods, we employ the R-convergence tool.

In this paper, we extend the \emph{principle of least action} and show that a \emph{Lagrange density}
always exists for the usual linear pde or linear fractional problems $\oA\,u=f$ in physics, if the
usual causality conditions $u|_{t<0}=0$ and $f|_{t<0}=0$ are assumed. (The approach is actually
applicable to uniquely solvable linear operator equations for which an adjoint exist.) The set
of Lagrange densities together with the zero vector form a non-trivial vector space and for each
different set of variables, e.g. $\{u_t,f\}$, $\{u_{xt},f\}$ or $\{u_t,u_x,u_y,u_z,f\}$, there
exists a Lagrange density that implies a Lagrange equation, which is equivalent to the considered
problem. The usual Lagrange density is such that it implies the 'original equation'. But there are
pde's for which the standard theory does not imply a Lagrange density. We show that for each of these
equations a (covariant) Lagrange density exists that leads to an equivalent \emph{higher order
pde} (if it is formulated with the above causality conditions). For each of these equations, there
exists a Lagrange density that implies a Lagrange equation that equals the original equation, but
this Lagrange density contains at least one \emph{linear integral operator}. A new point of view
is that each of these equivalent Lagrange densities for a given set of variables implies a (usually
different) \emph{generalized Hamiltonian density}, where the respective 'Hamiltonian' is conserved
if $\oA$ and $f$ are appropriate. The standard Lagrange density implies an Hamiltonian that (frequently)
models the energy. Morever, each conserved Hamiltonian implies countable many higher order Hamiltonians
that are conserved (if the solution of the considered problem is sufficiently smooth.)

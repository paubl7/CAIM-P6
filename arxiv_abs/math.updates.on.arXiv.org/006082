Existing compartmental models in epidemiology are limited in terms of optimizing the resource
allocation to control an epidemic outbreak under disease growth uncertainty. In this study, we
address this core limitation by presenting a multi-stage stochastic programming compartmental
model, which integrates the uncertain disease progression and resource allocation to control
an infectious disease outbreak. The proposed multi-stage stochastic program involves various
disease growth scenarios and optimizes the distribution of treatment centers and resources while
minimizing the total expected number of new infections and funerals. We define two new equity metrics,
namely infection and capacity equity, and explicitly consider equity for allocating treatment
funds and facilities over multiple time stages. We also study the multi-stage value of the stochastic
solution (VSS), which demonstrates the superiority of the proposed stochastic programming model
over its deterministic counterpart. We apply the proposed formulation to control the Ebola Virus
Disease (EVD) in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia of West Africa to determine the optimal and fair
resource-allocation strategies. Our model balances the proportion of infections over all regions,
even without including the infection equity or prevalence equity constraints. Model results also
show that allocating treatment resources proportional to population is sub-optimal, and enforcing
such a resource allocation policy might adversely impact the total number of infections and deaths,
and thus resulting in a high cost that we have to pay for the fairness. Our multi-stage stochastic
epidemic-logistics model is practical and can be adapted to control other infectious diseases
in meta-populations and dynamically evolving situations.

We study the structure of C*-algebras associated with compactly aligned product systems over group
embeddable right LCM-semigroups. Towards this end we employ controlled maps and a controlled elimination
method that associates the original cores to those of the controlling pair, and we combine with applications
of the C*-envelope theory for cosystems of nonselfadjoint operator algebras recently produced.
We derive several applications of these methods that generalize results on single C*-correspondences.
First we show that if the controlling group is exact then the co-universal C*-algebra of the product
system coincides with the quotient of the Fock C*-algebra by the ideal of strong covariance relations.
We show that if the controlling group is amenable then the product system is amenable. In particular
if the controlling group is abelian then the co-universal C*-algebra is the C*-envelope of the tensor
algebra. Secondly we give necessary and sufficient conditions for the Fock C*-algebra to be nuclear
and exact. When the controlling group is amenable we completely characterize nuclearity and exactness
of any equivariant injective Nica-covariant representation of the product system. Thirdly we
consider controlled maps that enjoy a saturation property. In this case we induce a compactly aligned
product system over the controlling pair that shares the same Fock representation, and preserves
injectivity. By using co-universality, we show that they share the same reduced covariance algebras.
If in addition the controlling pair is a total order then the fixed point algebra of the controlling
group induces a super-product system that has the same reduced covariance algebra and is moreover
reversible.

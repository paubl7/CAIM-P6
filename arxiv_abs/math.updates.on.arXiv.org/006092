The analysis of surface wave dispersion curves is a way to infer the vertical distribution of shear-wave
velocity. The range of applicability is extremely wide going, for example, from seismological
studies to geotechnical characterizations and exploration geophysics. However, the inversion
of the dispersion curves is severely ill-posed and only limited efforts have been put into the development
of effective regularization strategies. In particular, relatively simple smoothing regularization
terms are commonly used, even when this is in contrast with the expected features of the investigated
targets. To tackle this problem, stochastic approaches can be utilized, but they are too computationally
expensive to be practical, at least, in the case of large surveys. Instead, within a deterministic
framework, we evaluate the applicability of a regularizer capable of providing reconstructions
characterized by tunable levels of sparsity. This adjustable stabilizer is based on the minimum
support regularization, applied before on other kinds of geophysical measurements, but never
on surface wave data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this stabilizer on i) two benchmark - publicly
available - datasets at crustal and near-surface scales, ii) an experimental dataset collected
on a well-characterized site. In addition, we discuss a possible strategy for the estimation of
the depth of investigation. This strategy relies on the integrated sensitivity kernel used for
the inversion and calculated for each individual propagation mode. Moreover, we discuss the reliability,
and possible caveats, of the direct interpretation of this particular estimation of the depth of
investigation, especially in the presence of sharp boundary reconstructions.

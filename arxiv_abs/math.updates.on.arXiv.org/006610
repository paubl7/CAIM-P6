Discrete conformal structure on polyhedral surfaces is a discrete analogue of the smooth conformal
structure on surfaces that assigns discrete metrics by scalar functions defined on vertices. In
this paper, we introduce combinatorial $\alpha$-curvature for discrete conformal structures
on polyhedral surfaces, which is a parameterized generalization of the classical combinatorial
curvature. Then we prove the local and global rigidity of combinatorial $\alpha$-curvature with
respect to discrete conformal structures on polyhedral surfaces, which confirms parameterized
Glickenstein rigidity conjecture. To study the Yamabe problem for combinatorial $\alpha$-curvature,
we introduce combinatorial $\alpha$-Ricci flow for discrete conformal structures on polyhedral
surfaces, which is a generalization of Chow-Luo's combinatorial Ricci flow for Thurston's circle
packings and Luo's combinatorial Yamabe flow for vertex scaling on polyhedral surfaces. To handle
the potential singularities of the combinatorial $\alpha$-Ricci flow, we extend the flow through
the singularities by extending the inner angles in triangles by constants. Under the existence
of a discrete conformal structure with prescribed combinatorial curvature, the solution of extended
combinatorial $\alpha$-Ricci flow is proved to exist for all time and converge exponentially fast
for any initial value. This confirms a parameterized generalization of another conjecture of Glickenstein
on the convergence of combinatorial Ricci flow, gives an almost equivalent characterization of
the solvability of Yamabe problem for combinatorial $\alpha$-curvature in terms of combinatorial
$\alpha$-Ricci flow and provides an effective algorithm for finding discrete conformal structures
with prescribed combinatorial $\alpha$-curvatures.

Dynamic Portfolio optimization is the process of distribution and rebalancing of a fund into different
financial assets such as stocks, cryptocurrencies, etc, in consecutive trading periods to maximize
accumulated profits or minimize risks over a time horizon. This field saw huge developments in recent
years, because of the increased computational power and increased research in sequential decision
making through control theory. Recently Reinforcement Learning(RL) has been an important tool
in the development of sequential and dynamic portfolio optimization theory. In this paper, we design
a Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL) framework as an autonomous portfolio optimization agent consisting
of a Latent Feature State Space(LFSS) Module for filtering and feature extraction of financial
data which is used as a state space for deep RL model. We develop an extensive RL agent with high efficiency
and performance advantages over several benchmarks and model-free RL agents used in prior work.
The noisy and non-stationary behaviour of daily asset prices in the financial market is addressed
through Kalman Filter. Autoencoders, ZoomSVD, and restricted Boltzmann machines were the models
used and compared in the module to extract relevant time series features as state space. We simulate
weekly data, with practical constraints and transaction costs, on a portfolio of S&P 500 stocks.
We introduce a new benchmark based on technical indicator Kd-Index and Mean-Variance Model as compared
to equal weighted portfolio used in most of the prior work. The study confirms that the proposed RL
portfolio agent with state space function in the form of LFSS module gives robust results with an
attractive performance profile over baseline RL agents and given benchmarks.

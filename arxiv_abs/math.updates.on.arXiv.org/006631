We study $2$-dimensional Artin groups of hyperbolic type from the viewpoint of measure equivalence,
and establish rigidity theorems. We first prove that they are boundary amenable. So is every group
acting discretely by simplicial isometries on a connected piecewise hyperbolic $\mathrm{CAT}(-1)$
simplicial complex with countably many simplices in finitely many isometry types, assuming that
vertex stabilizers are boundary amenable. Consequently, they satisfy the Novikov conjecture.
We then show that measure equivalent $2$-dimensional Artin groups of hyperbolic type have isomorphic
fixed set graphs -- an analogue of the curve graph, introduced by Crisp. This yields classification
results. We obtain strong rigidity theorems. Let $G=G_\Gamma$ be a $2$-dimensional Artin group
of hyperbolic type, with $\mathrm{Out}(G)$ finite. When the automorphism groups of the fixed set
graph and of the Cayley complex $\mathfrak{C}$ coincide, every countable group $H$ which is measure
equivalent to $G$, is commensurable to a lattice in $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathfrak{C})$. This happens
whenever $\Gamma$ is triangle-free with all labels at least $3$ -- unless $G$ is commensurable to
the direct sum of $\mathbb{Z}$ and a free group. When $\Gamma$ satisfies an additional star-rigidity
condition, then $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathfrak{C})$ is countable, and $H$ is almost isomorphic to $G$.
This has applications to orbit equivalence rigidity, and rigidity results for von Neumann algebras
associated to ergodic actions of Artin groups. We also derive a rigidity statement regarding possible
lattice envelopes of certain Artin groups, and a cocycle superrigidity theorem from higher-rank
lattices to $2$-dimensional Artin groups of hyperbolic type.

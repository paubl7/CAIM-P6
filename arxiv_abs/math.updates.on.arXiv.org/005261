We study the propagation profile of the solution $u(x,t)$ to the nonlinear diffusion problem $u_t-\Delta
u=f(u)\; (x\in \mathbb R^N,\;t>0)$, $u(x,0)=u_0(x) \; (x\in\mathbb R^N)$, where $f(u)$ is of
multistable type: $f(0)=f(p)=0$, $f'(0)<0$, $f'(p)<0$, where $p$ is a positive constant, and
$f$ may have finitely many nondegenerate zeros in the interval $(0, p)$. The class of initial functions
$u_0$ includes in particular those which are nonnegative and decay to 0 at infinity. We show that,
if $u(\cdot, t)$ converges to $p$ as $t\to\infty$ in $L^\infty_{loc}(\mathbb R^N)$, then the long-time
dynamical behavior of $u$ is determined by the one dimensional propagating terraces introduced
by Ducrot, Giletti and Matano [DGM]. For example, we will show that in such a case, in any given direction
$\nu\in\mathbb{S}^{N-1}$, $u(x\cdot \nu, t)$ converges to a pair of one dimensional propagating
terraces, one moving in the direction of $x\cdot \nu>0$, and the other is its reflection moving in
the opposite direction $x\cdot\nu<0$. Our approach relies on the introduction of the notion "radial
terrace solution", by which we mean a special solution $V(|x|, t)$ of $V_t-\Delta V=f(V)$ such that,
as $t\to\infty$, $V(r,t)$ converges to the corresponding one dimensional propagating terrace
of [DGM]. We show that such radial terrace solutions exist in our setting, and the general solution
$u(x,t)$ can be well approximated by a suitablly shifted radial terrace solution $V(|x|, t)$. These
will enable us to obtain better convergence result for $u(x,t)$. We stress that $u(x,t)$ is a high
dimensional solution without any symmetry. Our results indicate that the one dimensional propagating
terrace is a rather fundamental concept; it provides the basic structure and ingredients for the
long-time profile of solutions in all space dimensions.

We construct an infinite volume spatial random permutation $(\chi,\sigma)$, where $\chi\subset\mathbb
R^d$ is locally finite and $\sigma:\chi\to \chi$ is a permutation, associated to the formal Hamiltonian
\begin{align} \nonumber H(\chi,\sigma) = \sum_{x\in \chi} \|x-\sigma(x)\|^2. \end{align}
The measures are parametrized by the point density $\rho$ and the temperature $\alpha$. Spatial
random permutations are naturally related to boson systems through a representation originally
due to Feynman (1953). Let $\rho_c=\rho_c(\alpha)$ be the critical density for Bose-Einstein
condensation in Feynman's representation. Each finite cycle of $\sigma$ induces a loop of points
of~$\chi$. For $\rho\le \rho_c$ we define $(\chi, \sigma)$ as a Poisson process of finite unrooted
loops of a random walk with Gaussian increments that we call Gaussian loop soup, analogous to the
Brownian loop soup of Lawler and Werner (2004). We also construct Gaussian random interlacements,
a Poisson process of doubly infinite trajectories of random walks with Gaussian increments analogous
to the Brownian random interlacements of Sznitman (2010). For $d\ge 3$ and $\rho>\rho_c$ we define
$(\chi,\sigma)$ as the superposition of independent realizations of the Gaussian loop soup at
density $\rho_c$ and the Gaussian random interlacements at density $\rho-\rho_c$. In either case
we call $(\chi, \sigma)$ a Gaussian random permutation at density $\rho$ and temperature $\alpha$.
The resulting measure satisfies a Markov property and it is Gibbs for the Hamiltonian $H$. Its point
marginal $\chi$ has the same distribution as the boson point process introduced by Shirai-Takahashi
(2003) in the subcritical case, and by Tamura-Ito (2007) in the supercritical case.

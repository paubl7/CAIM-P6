We propose a new optimal consumption model in which the degree of addictiveness of habit formation
is directly controlled through a consumption constraint. In particular, we assume that the individual
is unwilling to consume at a rate below a certain proportion $0<\alpha\le1$ of her consumption habit,
which is the exponentially-weighted average of past consumption rates. $\alpha=1$ prohibits
the habit process to decrease and corresponds to the completely addictive model. $\alpha=0$ makes
the habit-formation constraint moot and corresponds to the non-addictive model. $0<\alpha<1$
leads to partially addictive models, with the level of addictiveness increasing with $\alpha$.
In contrast to the existing habit-formation literature, our constraint cannot be incorporated
in the objective function through infinite marginal utility. Assuming that the individual invests
in a risk-free market, we formulate and solve an infinite-horizon, deterministic control problem
to maximize the discounted CRRA utility of the consumption-to-habit process subject to the habit-formation
constraint. Optimal consumption policies are derived explicitly in terms of the solution of a nonlinear
free-boundary problem, which we analyze in detail. Impatient always consume above the minimum
rate; thus, they eventually attain the minimum wealth-to-habit ratio. Patient individuals consume
at the minimum rate if their wealth-to-habit ratio is below a threshold, and above it otherwise.
By consuming patiently, these individuals maintain a wealth-to-habit ratio that is greater than
the minimum acceptable level. Additionally, we prove that the optimal consumption path is hump-shaped
if the initial wealth-to-habit ratio is either: (1) larger than a high threshold; or (2) below a low
threshold and the agent is less risk averse. Thus, we provide a simple explanation for the consumption
hump observed by various empirical studies.

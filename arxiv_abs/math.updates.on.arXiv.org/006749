The aim of this paper is to make a systematical study on the stability of polynomials in combinatorics.
Applying the characterizations of Borcea and Br\"and\'en concerning linear operators preserving
stability, we present criteria for real stability and Hurwitz stability. We also give a criterion
for Hurwitz stability of the Tur\'{a}n expressions. As applications, we derive some stability
results occurred in the literature in a unified manner. In addition, we obtain the Hurwitz stability
of Tur\'{a}n expressions for alternating runs polynomials of types $A$ and $B$ and solve a conjecture
concerning Hurwitz stability of alternating runs polynomials defined on a dual set of Stirling
permutations. Furthermore, we prove that the Hurwitz stability of any symmetric polynomial implies
its semi-$\gamma$-positivity. We study a class of symmetric polynomials and derive many nice properties
including Hurwitz stability, semi-$\gamma$-positivity, non $\gamma$-positivity, unimodality,
strong $q$-log-convexity, the Jacobi continued fraction expansion and the relation with derivative
polynomials. In particular, these properties of the alternating descents polynomials of types
$A$ and $B$ can be obtained in a unified approach. Finally, we use real stability to prove a criterion
for zeros interlacing between a polynomial and its reciprocal polynomial, which implies the alternatingly
increasing property. This criterion extends a result of Br\"and\'en and Solus and unifies such
properties for many combinatorial polynomials, including ascent polynomials for $k$-ary words,
descent polynomials on signed Stirling permutations and $q$-analog of descent polynomials on
colored permutations, and so on. We prove the alternatingly increasing property and zeros interlacing
for two kinds of peak polynomials on the dual set of Stirling permutations.

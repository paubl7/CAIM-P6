The asymptotic stable region and long-time decay rate of solutions to linear homogeneous Caputo
time fractional ordinary differential equations (F-ODEs) are known to be completely determined
by the eigenvalues of the coefficient matrix. Very different from the exponential decay of solutions
to classical ODEs, solutions of F-ODEs decay only polynomially, leading to the so-called Mittag-Leffler
stability, which was already extended to semi-linear F-ODEs with small perturbations. This work
is mainly devoted to the qualitative analysis of the long-time behavior of numerical solutions.
By applying the singularity analysis of generating functions developed by Flajolet and Odlyzko
(SIAM J. Disc. Math. 3 (1990), 216-240), we are able to prove that both $\mathcal{L}$1 scheme and
strong $A$-stable fractional linear multistep methods (F-LMMs) can preserve the numerical Mittag-Leffler
stability for linear homogeneous F-ODEs exactly as in the continuous case. Through an improved
estimate of the discrete fractional resolvent operator, we show that strong $A$-stable F-LMMs
are also Mittag-Leffler stable for semi-linear F-ODEs under small perturbations. For the numerical
schemes based on $\alpha$-difference approximation to Caputo derivative, we establish the Mittag-Leffler
stability for semi-linear problems by making use of properties of the Poisson transformation and
the decay rate of the continuous fractional resolvent operator. Numerical experiments are presented
for several typical time fractional evolutional equations, including time fractional sub-diffusion
equations, fractional linear system and semi-linear F-ODEs. All the numerical results exhibit
the typical long-time polynomial decay rate, which is fully consistent with our theoretical predictions.

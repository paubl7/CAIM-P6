Lambert's problem is the orbital boundary-value problem constrained by two points and elapsed
time. It is one of the most extensively studied problems in celestial mechanics and astrodynamics,
and, as such, it has always attracted the interest of mathematicians and engineers. Its solution
lies at the base of algorithms for, e.g., orbit determination, orbit design (mission planning),
space rendezvous and interception, space debris correlation, missile and spacecraft targeting.
There is abundancy of literature discussing various approaches developed over the years to solve
Lambert's problem. We have collected more than 70 papers and, of course, the issue is treated in most
astrodynamics and celestial mechanics textbooks. From our analysis of the documents, we have been
able to identify six or seven main solution methods, each associated to a number of revisions and
variations, and many, so to say, secondary research lines with little or no posterior development.
We have ascertained plenty of literature with proposed solutions, in many cases supplemented by
performance comparisons with other methods. We have reviewed and organized the existing bibliography
on Lambert's problem and we have performed a quantitative comparison among the existing methods
for its solution. The analysis is based on the following issues: choice of the free parameter, number
of iterations, generality of the mathematical formulation, limits of applicability (degeneracies,
domain of the parameter, special cases and peculiarities), accuracy, and suitability to automatic
execution. Eventually we have tested the performance of each code. The solvers that incorporate
the best qualities are Bate's algorithm via universal variables with Newton-Raphson and Izzo's
Householder algorithm. The former is the fastest, the latter exhibits the best ratio between speed,
robustness and accuracy.

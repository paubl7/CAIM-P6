Wireless power transfer (WPT) is an emerging paradigm that will enable using wireless to its full
potential in future networks, not only to convey information but also to deliver energy. Such networks
will enable trillions of future low-power devices to sense, compute, connect, and energize anywhere,
anytime, and on the move. The design of such future networks brings new challenges and opportunities
for signal processing, machine learning, sensing, and computing so as to make the best use of the
RF radiations, spectrum, and network infrastructure in providing cost-effective and real-time
power supplies to wireless devices and enable wireless-powered applications. In this paper, we
first review recent signal processing techniques to make WPT and wireless information and power
transfer as efficient as possible. Topics include power amplifier and energy harvester nonlinearities,
active and passive beamforming, intelligent reflecting surfaces, receive combining with multi-antenna
harvester, modulation, coding, waveform, massive MIMO, channel acquisition, transmit diversity,
multi-user power region characterization, coordinated multipoint, and distributed antenna
systems. Then, we overview two different design methodologies: the model and optimize approach
relying on analytical system models, modern convex optimization, and communication theory, and
the learning approach based on data-driven end-to-end learning and physics-based learning. We
discuss the pros and cons of each approach, especially when accounting for various nonlinearities
in wireless-powered networks, and identify interesting emerging opportunities for the approaches
to complement each other. Finally, we identify new emerging wireless technologies where WPT may
play a key role -- wireless-powered mobile edge computing and wireless-powered sensing -- arguing
WPT, communication, computation, and sensing must be jointly designed.

We consider strongly-convex-strongly-concave saddle-point problems with general non-bilinear
objective and different condition numbers with respect to the primal and the dual variables. First,
we consider such problems with smooth composite terms, one of which having finite-sum structure.
For this setting we propose a variance reduction algorithm with complexity estimates superior
to the existing bounds in the literature. Second, we consider finite-sum saddle-point problems
with composite terms and propose several algorithms depending on the properties of the composite
terms. When the composite terms are smooth we obtain better complexity bounds than the ones in the
literature, including the bounds of a recently proposed nearly-optimal algorithms which do not
consider the composite structure of the problem. If the composite terms are prox-friendly, we propose
a variance reduction algorithm that, on the one hand, is accelerated compared to existing variance
reduction algorithms and, on the other hand, provides in the composite setting similar complexity
bounds to the nearly-optimal algorithm which is designed for non-composite setting. Besides that,
our algorithms allow to separate the complexity bounds, i.e. estimate, for each part of the objective
separately, the number of oracle calls that is sufficient to achieve a given accuracy. This is important
since different parts can have different arithmetic complexity of the oracle, and it is desired
to call expensive oracles less often than cheap oracles. The key thing to all these results is our
general framework for saddle-point problems, which may be of independent interest. This framework,
in turn is based on our proposed Accelerated Meta-Algorithm for composite optimization with probabilistic
inexact oracles and probabilistic inexactness in the proximal mapping, which may be of independent
interest as well.

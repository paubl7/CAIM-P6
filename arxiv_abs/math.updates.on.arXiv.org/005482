There are two versions of the Jacobi weight encountered in random matrix theory. The most common
is $x^a(1-x)^b$ supported on the interval $(0,1)$, which is familiar from the study of the singular
values of sub-blocks of unitary matrices, for example. But there is also the weight $(1-x)^a(1+x)^b$
supported on the interval $(-1,1)$, which occurs for example in the study of certain random real
orthogonal matrices. We show that the density for the $\beta$-ensemble with respect to the Jacobi
weight supported on $(-1,1)$ can be related to the density for the $\beta$-ensemble with respect
to the Cauchy weight $ (1-ix)^\eta (1 + ix )^{\bar{\eta}}$ by appropriate analytic continuation.
This has the consequence of implying that the latter density satisfies a linear differential equation
of degree three for $\beta=2$, and of degree five for $\beta=1$ and $4$, analogues of which are already
known for the Jacobi weight supported on $(0,1)$. We concentrate on the case $a=b$ (Jacobi weight
on $(-1,1)$) and $\eta$ real (Cauchy weight) since then the density is an even function and the differential
equations simplify. From the differential equations, recurrences can be obtained for the moments
of the Jacobi weight supported on $(-1,1)$ and/or the moments of the Cauchy weight. Particular attention
is paid to the case $\beta = 2$ and the Jacobi weight on $(-1,1)$ in the symmetric case $a= b$, which
in keeping with a recent result obtained by Assiotis et al.~for the $\beta = 2$ case of the symmetric
Cauchy weight (parameter $\eta$ real), allows for an explicit solution of the recurrence in terms
of particular continuous Hahn polynomials. Also for the symmetric Cauchy weight with $\eta=-\beta(N-1)/2-\alpha$,
after appropriately scaling $\alpha$ proportional to $N$, we use differential equations to compute
terms in the $1/N^2$ ($1/N$) expansion of the resolvent for $\beta = 2$ ($\beta = 1, 4$).

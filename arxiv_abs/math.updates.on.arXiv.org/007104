Quantum contextual sets have been recognized as resources for universal quantum computation,
quantum steering and quantum communication. Their implementation relies on our ability to discriminate
between the statistics of the measurement data of quantum states and the statistics of the assumed
measurement data of their classical noncontextual counterparts. In this paper we review existing
discriminators and introduce a couple of new ones. We show that Groetschel-Lovasz-Schrijver's
inequality is violated for arbitrary many contextual hypergraphs and that it is therefore not a
noncontextuality inequality. On the other hand, the majority of inequalities defined via operators
in the literature make use of already known hypergraphs to generate the operators. Therefore, in
this paper we shift our focus from operators to hypergraphs and their structure. We obtain that the
multiplicity of states, i.e., their repeated measurements at multiple gates, provide us with two
different statistics of data and three corresponding kinds of inequality only one of which turns
out to be the noncontextuality inequality. We also obtain the following particular results: definite
vertex multiplicities uniquely characterize the master sets from which all known contextual sets
are generated; by discarding vertices with multiplicities equal to one we generate contextual
sets from both noncontextual and bigger contextual ones; hypergraphs underlying operator-based
contextual sets are themselves contextual; the smallest critical contextual hypergraph in any
dimension has just 3 edges and 3 vertices; several graph presentations and Greechie diagram transliterations
of hypergraphs from the literature are shown to be inconsistent.

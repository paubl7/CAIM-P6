One of the open problems in Algebraic topology is the "hit" problem for a module over the Steenrod
ring $\mathscr A$. The problem asks a minimal set of generators for the polynomial algebra $\mathcal
P_m:=\mathbb F_2[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m] = H^*((K(\mathbb F_2, 1))^{\times m})$ regarded as a connected
unstable $\mathscr A$-module on $m$ generators with $|x_i| = 1$ for every $i$. The hit problem has
been thoroughly studied for 35 years in a variety of contexts by many authors and completely solved
for $m\leq 4.$ Furthermore, it is applied in studying the cohomology of $\mathscr A$ via the $m$-th
algebraic transfer $Tr^{\mathscr A}_m$ of William Singer [32]. The aim of this work is to study the
hit problem of five variables. An efficient approach for solving the problem has been given. At the
same time, this result will be applied to the investigation of the fifth transfer of Singer and the
modular representation of the general linear group of rank 5 over $\mathbb F_2.$ More precisely,
we extend a result [27] on the hit problem for $\mathscr A$-module $\mathcal P_5$ in the generic degree
$n_t:=5(2^t-1) + 18.2^t$ with $t\geq 0.$ This result confirms Sum's conjecture [36] for the relation
between the minimal sets of $\mathscr A$-generators of the polynomial algebras $\mathcal P_{m-1}$
and $\mathcal P_{m}$ in the case $m=5$ and the above generic degree. As a consequence, we obtain the
dimension of $\mathcal P_6$ in the degree $5(2^{t+4}-1) + n_1.2^{t+4}$ for any $t\geq 1.$ Moreover,
using the above result for $t = 0,$ and a representation in the lambda algebra of $Tr_5^{\mathscr
A}$, we show that $Tr^{\mathscr A}_5$ is an isomorphism in the bidegree $(5, 5+n_0).$ Our approach
is different from that of Singer in studying the algebraic transfer.

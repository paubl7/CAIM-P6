Let $G$ be a prolific graph, that is a finite connected simple graph not isomorphic to a cycle nor a
path nor the star graph $K_{1,3}$. The line-graph of $G$, $L(G)$, is defined by having its vertex-set
equal to the edge-set of $G$ and two vertices of $L(G)$ are adjacent if the corresponding edges are
adjacent in $G$. For a positive integer $k$, the iterated line-graph $L^k(G)$ is defined by $L^k(G)=L(L^{k-1}(G))$.
In this paper we consider fifteen well-known graph parameters and study their behaviour when the
operation of taking the line-graph is iterated. We first show that all of these parameters are unbounded,
that is, if $P=P(G)$ is such a parameter defined on a prolific graph $G$, then for any positive integer
$N$, there is a $k$ such that $P(L^k(G))>N$. This idea of unboundedness is motivated by a well-known
old result of van Rooij and Wilf that says that the number of vertices is unbounded if and only if the
graph is prolific. Following this preliminary result, the main thrust of the paper will be the study
of the index $k(P,{\cal F})$ which, for a given family $\cal F$ of prolific graphs, is defined as the
least integer $k$ such that $P(L^k(G)) > P(G)$ for every $G$ in $\cal F$. The problem of determining
the index of a parameter is motivated by a classical result of Chartrand who showed that it could require
$k=|V(G)|-3$ iterations to guarantee that $L^k(G)$ has a hamiltonian cycle. We indicate some of
those parameters for which the index has been determined and investigate new ones. Our aim is to determine,
for each parameter, the index for as wide a class of graphs as possible and to characterise those graphs
which attain this index. We manage to achieve this for most of these parameters, for example, the
matching number $\mu$, where we show that the index is $4$ and for which we give a complete characterization
of those graphs requiring the full four iterations.

This survey article mainly addresses to graduate students and young researchers in complex geometry
willing to enter the beautiful word of connections between curvature and Kobayashi hyperbolicity.
It is a detailed account of a recent breakthrough by Wu and Yau, shortly after generalized by Tosatti
and Yang (and others), which sits on the crossroad between complex differential geometry and Kobayashi
hyperbolicity. More specifically, an old conjecture by Kobayashi, stated at the very beginning
of the theory, predict that a Kobayashi hyperbolic manifold should have ample canonical bundle.
Now, on the one hand it is also known since the beginning of the theory that a compact complex manifold
with a Hermitian metric whose holomorphic sectional curvature is negative is Kobayashi hyperbolic.
On the other hand a compact K\"ahler manifold with ample canonical bundle is known -- by the celebrated
work of Aubin and Yau -- to admit a K\"ahler metric with (constant) negative Ricci curvature. Wu and
Yau's theorem states that if a smooth projective manifolds admits a K\"ahler metric with negative
holomorphic sectional curvature, then it also admits a possibly different K\"ahler metric whose
Ricci curvature is negative. It can be therefore seen as a weak confirmation of Kobayashi's conjecture
above, since it gives the same conclusion but with the stronger hypothesis about the holomorphic
sectional curvature. Beside a fully detailed presentation of the proof of this theorem, we also
provide some basic background on complex differential geometry as well as several (positive or
negative) results about the theme of curvature and hyperbolicity. Some natural open questions
are also discussed. The proof of the Wu-Yau theorem presented here follows quite closely the original
main key ideas by Wu and Yau, but the conclusion is somehow simplified using the pluripotential approach
of Diverio and Trapani.

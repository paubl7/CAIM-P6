Parallelization is an algebraic operation that lifts problems to sequences in a natural way. Given
a sequence as an instance of the parallelized problem, another sequence is a solution of this problem
if every component is instance-wise a solution of the original problem. In the Weihrauch lattice
parallelization is a closure operator. Here we introduce a dual operation that we call stashing
and that also lifts problems to sequences, but such that only some component has to be an instance-wise
solution. In this case the solution is stashed away in the sequence. This operation, if properly
defined, induces an interior operator in the Weihrauch lattice. We also study the action of the monoid
induced by stashing and parallelization on the Weihrauch lattice, and we prove that it leads to at
most five distinct degrees, which (in the maximal case) are always organized in pentagons. We also
introduce another closely related interior operator in the Weihrauch lattice that replaces solutions
of problems by upper Turing cones that are strong enough to compute solutions. It turns out that on
parallelizable degrees this interior operator corresponds to stashing. This implies that, somewhat
surprisingly, all problems which are simultaneously parallelizable and stashable have computability-theoretic
characterizations. Finally, we apply all these results in order to study the recently introduced
discontinuity problem, which appears as the bottom of a number of natural stashing-parallelization
pentagons. The discontinuity problem is not only the stashing of several variants of the lesser
limited principle of omniscience, but it also parallelizes to the non-computability problem.
This supports the slogan that "non-computability is the parallelization of discontinuity".

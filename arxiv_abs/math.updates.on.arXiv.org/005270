We study Aluthge transforms of left invertible shift operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces
(RKHS), and in particular, on tridiagonal spaces. A RKHS $\mathcal{H}_k$ of analytic functions
on the open unit disc is called tridiagonal space if there exist scalars $a_n (\neq 0)$ and $b_n$,
$n \geq 0$, such that $\{(a_n + b_nz) z^n\}_{n=0}^\infty$ is an orthonormal basis of $\mathcal{H}_k$.
It is easy to see that \[ k(z, w) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty \Big((a_n + b_n z)z^n\Big) \Big((\bar{a}_n
+ \bar{b}_n \bar{w}) \bar{w}^n \Big), \] and so $k$ is a band kernel with bandwidth $1$. We prove that
the shift on $\mathcal{H}_k$ is left invertible if and only if the sequence $\Big\{\Big| \frac{a_n}{a_{n+1}}\Big|\Big\}_{n\geq
0}$ is bounded away from zero. We employ two different approaches to compute Aluthge transforms
(in terms of kernel functions) of shifts on $\mathcal{H}_k$ (or, more general RKHS): the first is
based on Shimorin's analytic model; and the second approach is rather direct and based on RKHS techniques.
On the other hand, unlike the case of weighted shifts, we find that Shimorin models fail to bring to
the foreground the tridiagonal structure of shifts. In fact, the tridiagonal structure of a kernel
$k$, as above, is preserved under Shimorin model if and only if $b_0=0$ or that $M_z$ on $\mathcal{H}_k$
is a weighted shift. We prove a number of concrete classification results concerning invariance
of tridiagonality of kernels under the action of Aluthge transforms, Shimorin models and positive
operators. We also give explicit algorithms to compute Aluthge transforms (in terms of kernel functions)
of shifts on truncated tridiagonal spaces. Curiously, in contrast to direct RKHS techniques, often
Shimorin models fails to yield tridiagonal Aluthge transforms of shifts defined on tridiagonal
spaces.

This paper deals with a version of the two-timing method which describes various slow effects caused
by externally imposed fast oscillations. Such small oscillations are often called vibrations
and the research area can be referred as vibrodynamics. The basic small parameter represents the
ratio of two time-scales; it appears in equations as a regular perturbation. We focus our study on
the usually hidden aspects of the two-timing method such as the uniqueness or multiplicity of distinguished
limits (DLs) and the universal structures of averaged equations. The equations considered represent
a generic system of first order ODEs, containing a prescribed oscillating velocity u. The derived
dimensionless form of these equations contains two scaling parameters, and proper connections
between them lead to asymptotic solutions. The main result is the demonstration that there are two
(and only two) different DLs called DL-1 and DL-2. Calculations show the existence of the closed
systems of equations for the first three successive approximations, and indicate that an infinite
number of such closed equations are available. These equations possess universal structures,
containing a quadratic in u averaged function called the drift velocity V. DL-2 produces a closed
averaged system of equations in the zeroth approximation that always represents the main aim in
applications. In DL-1, the averaged equations of the zeroth approximation formally coincide with
the original system, while the first approximation exhibits a similarity with a linearized version
of the previous equation; however it is drastically different, since V appears as its nonhomogeneous
driving term. Possible generalizations and interpretations are briefly discussed. To illustrate
the broadness of our study, two examples from mathematical biology are shown. The paper is accessible
for students in applied mathematics.

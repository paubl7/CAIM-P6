Global optimisation problems in high-dimensional and infinite dimensional spaces arise in various
real-world applications such as engineering, economics, geophysics, biology, machine learning,
optimal control, etc. Among stochastic approaches to global optimisation, biology-inspired
methods are currently popular in the literature, imitating natural ecological and evolutionary
processes and reported to be efficient in many practical study cases. However, many of bio-inspired
methods have some vital drawbacks. Due to their semi-empirical nature, convergence to the globally
optimal solution cannot always be guaranteed and struggles with the high dimensionality of space,
showing a slow convergence. Here, we present a bio-inspired global stochastic optimisation method,
applicable in Hilbert function spaces, inspired by Darwin's' famous idea of the survival of the
fittest, therefore, referred to as the `Survival of the Fittest Algorithm' (SoFA). Mathematically,
the convergence of SoFA is a consequence of a fundamental property of localisation of probabilistic
measure in a Hilbert space, we rigorously prove the convergence of the introduced algorithm for
a generic class of functionals. As an insightful real-world problem, we apply SoFA to find globally
optimal trajectories for daily vertical migrations of zooplankton in ocean and lakes, considered
to be the largest synchronised movement of biomass on Earth. We maximise fitness in a function space
derived from a von-Foerster stage-structured population model with biologically realistic parameters.
We show that for problems of fitness maximisation in high-dimensional spaces, SoFA performs better
than some other stochastic global optimisation algorithms. We highlight the links between the
new optimisation algorithm and natural selection process in ecosystems occurring within a population
via gradual exclusion of competitive con-specific strains.

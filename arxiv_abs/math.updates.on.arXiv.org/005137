Roy and Bhattacharya (2020) provided Bayesian characterization of infinite series, and their
most important application, namely, to the Dirichlet series characterizing the (in)famous Riemann
Hypothesis, revealed insights that are not in support of the most celebrated conjecture for over
150 years. In contrast with deterministic series considered by Roy and Bhattacharya (2020), in
this article we take up random infinite series for our investigation. Remarkably, our method does
not require any simplifying assumption. Albeit the Bayesian characterization theory for random
series is no different from that for the deterministic setup, construction of effective upper bounds
for partial sums, required for implementation, turns out to be a challenging undertaking in the
random setup. In this article, we construct parametric and nonparametric upper bound forms for
the partial sums of random infinite series and demonstrate the generality of the latter in comparison
to the former. Simulation studies exhibit high accuracy and efficiency of the nonparametric bound
in all the setups that we consider. Finally, exploiting the property that the summands tend to zero
in the case of series convergence, we consider application of our nonparametric bound driven Bayesian
method to global climate change analysis. Specifically, analyzing the global average temperature
record over the years 1850--2016 and Holocene global average temperature reconstruction data
12,000 years before present, we conclude, in spite of the current global warming situation, that
global climate dynamics is subject to temporary variability only, the current global warming being
an instance, and long term global warming or cooling either in the past or in the future, are highly
unlikely.

The original Hegselmann-Krause (HK) model consists of a set of~$n$ agents that are characterized
by their opinion, a number in~$[0, 1]$. Each agent, say agent~$i$, updates its opinion~$x_i$ by
taking the average opinion of all its neighbors, the agents whose opinion differs from~$x_i$ by
at most~$\epsilon$. There are two types of~HK models: the synchronous~HK model and the asynchronous~HK
model. For the synchronous model, all the agents update their opinion simultaneously at each time
step, whereas for the asynchronous~HK model, only one agent chosen uniformly at random updates
its opinion at each time step. This paper is concerned with a variant of the~HK opinion dynamics,
called the mixed~HK model, where each agent can choose its degree of stubbornness and mix its opinion
with the average opinion of its neighbors at each update. The degree of the stubbornness of agents
can be different and/or vary over time. An agent is not stubborn or absolutely open-minded if its
new opinion at each update is the average opinion of its neighbors, and absolutely stubborn if its
opinion does not change at the time of the update. The particular case where, at each time step, all
the agents are absolutely open-minded is the synchronous~HK model. In contrast, the asynchronous
model corresponds to the particular case where, at each time step, all the agents are absolutely
stubborn except for one agent chosen uniformly at random who is absolutely open-minded. We first
show that some of the common properties of the synchronous~HK model, such as finite-time convergence,
do not hold for the mixed model. We then investigate conditions under which the asymptotic stability
holds, or a consensus can be achieved for the mixed model.

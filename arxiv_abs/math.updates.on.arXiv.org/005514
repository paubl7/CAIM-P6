A service system with multiple types of arriving customers is considered. There is an infinite number
of homogeneous servers. Multiple customers can be placed for simultaneous service into one server,
subject to general packing constraints. Each new arriving customer is placed for service immediately,
either into an occupied server, as long as packing constraints are not violated, or into an empty
server. After service completion, each customer leaves its server and the system. The basic objective
is to minimize the number of occupied servers in steady state. We study a Greedy-Random (GRAND) placement
(packing) algorithm, introduced in [23]. This is a simple online algorithm, which places each arriving
customer uniformly at random into either one of the already occupied servers that can still fit the
customer, or one of the so-called zero-servers, which are empty servers designated to be available
to new arrivals. In [23], a version of the algorithm, labeled GRAND($aZ$), was considered, where
the number of zero servers is $aZ$, with $Z$ being the current total number of customers in the system,
and $a>0$ being an algorithm parameter. GRAND($aZ$) was shown in [23] to be asymptotically optimal
in the following sense: (a) the steady-state optimality gap grows linearly in the system scale $r$
(the mean total number of customers in service), i.e. as $c(a) r$ for some $c(a)> 0$; and (b) $c(a)
\to 0$ as $a\to 0$. In this paper, we consider the GRAND($Z^p$) algorithm, in which the number of zero-servers
is $Z^p$, where $p \in (1-1/(8\kappa),1)$ is an algorithm parameter, and $(\kappa-1)$ is the maximum
possible number of customers that a server can fit. We prove the asymptotic optimality of GRAND($Z^p$)
in the sense that the steady-state optimality gap is $o(r)$, sublinear in the system scale. This
is a stronger form of asymptotic optimality than that of GRAND($aZ$).

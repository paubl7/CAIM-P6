We consider the KZ equations over $\mathbb C$ in the case, when the hypergeometric solutions are
hyperelliptic integrals of genus $g$. Then the space of solutions is a $2g$-dimensional complex
vector space. We also consider the same equations modulo $p^s$, where $p$ is an odd prime and $s$ is
a positive integer, and over the field $\mathbb Q_p$ of $p$-adic numbers. We construct polynomial
solutions of the KZ equations modulo $p^s$ and study the space $\mathcal M_{p^s}$ of all constructed
solutions. We show that the $p$-adic limit of $\mathcal M_{p^s}$ as $s\to\infty$ gives us a $g$-dimensional
vector space of solutions of the KZ equations over $\mathbb Q_p$. The solutions over $\mathbb Q_p$
are power series at a certain asymptotic zone of the KZ equations. In the appendix written jointly
with Steven Sperber we consider all asymptotic zones of the KZ equations in the case $g=1$ of elliptic
integrals. The $p$-adic limit of $\mathcal M_{p^s}$ as $s\to \infty$ gives us a one-dimensional
space of solutions over $\mathbb Q_p$ at every asymptotic zone. We apply Dwork's theory and show
that our germs of solutions over $\mathbb Q_p$ defined at different asymptotic zones analytically
continue into a single global invariant line subbundle of the associated KZ connection. Notice
that the corresponding KZ connection over $\mathbb C$ does not have proper nontrivial invariant
subbundles, and therefore our invariant line subbundle is a new feature of the KZ equations over
$\mathbb Q_p$. We describe the Frobenius transformations of solutions of the KZ equations for $g
=1$ and then recover the unit roots of the zeta functions of the elliptic curves defined by the equations
$y^2= \beta \,x(x-1)(x-\alpha)$ over the finite field $\mathbb F_p$. Here $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb
F_p^\times, \alpha \ne 1$.

Network flow formulations are among the most successful tools to solve optimization problems.
Such formulations correspond to determining an optimal flow in a network. One particular class
of network flow formulations is the arc flow, where variables represent flows on individual arcs
of the network. For $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problems, polynomial-sized arc flow models typically
provide weak linear relaxations and may have too much symmetry to be efficient in practice. Instead,
arc flow models with a pseudo-polynomial size usually provide strong relaxations and are efficient
in practice. The interest in pseudo-polynomial arc flow formulations has grown considerably in
the last twenty years, in which they have been used to solve many open instances of hard problems.
A remarkable advantage of pseudo-polynomial arc flow models is the possibility to solve practical-sized
instances directly by a Mixed Integer Linear Programming solver, avoiding the implementation
of complex methods based on column generation. In this survey, we present theoretical foundations
of pseudo-polynomial arc flow formulations, by showing a relation between their network and Dynamic
Programming (DP). This relation allows a better understanding of the strength of these formulations,
through a link with models obtained by Dantzig-Wolfe decomposition. The relation with DP also allows
a new perspective to relate state-space relaxation methods for DP with arc flow models. We also present
a dual point of view to contrast the linear relaxation of arc flow models with that of models based
on paths and cycles. To conclude, we review the main solution methods and applications of arc flow
models based on DP in several domains such as cutting, packing, scheduling, and routing.

Discrete-event systems (DESs) are generally composed of transitions between discrete states
caused by spontaneous occurrences of partially-observed (aka labeled) events. Detectability
is a fundamental property in labeled dynamical systems, which describes whether one can use an observed
label sequence to reconstruct the current state. Labeled weighted automata (LWAs) can be regarded
as a timed model of DESs. In this paper, by developing appropriate methods, we for the first time obtain
characterization of four fundamental notions of detectability for general LWAs over monoids,
where the four notions are strong (periodic) detectability (SD and SPD) and weak (periodic) detectability
(WD and WPD). The contributions of the current paper are as follows. Firstly, we formulate the notions
of concurrent composition, observer, and detector for LWAs. Secondly, we use the concurrent composition
to give an equivalent condition for SD, use the detector to give an equivalent condition for SPD,
and use the observer to give equivalent conditions for WD and WPD, all for general LWAs. Thirdly,
we prove that for an LWA over monoid $(\mathbb{N},+,0)$ (denoted by $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}}$),
its concurrent composition, observer, and detector can be computed in NP, 2-EXPTIME, and NP, respectively,
by developing a novel connection between $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}}$ and the NP-complete exact
path length problem (proved by [Nyk\"{a}nen and Ukkonen, 2002]). As a result, we prove that for $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}}$,
SD and SPD can be verified in coNP, while WD and WPD can be verified in 2-EXPTIME. Finally, we prove
that the problems of verifying SD and SPD of deterministic $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}}$ are both
coNP-hard. The original methods developed in this paper will provide foundations for characterizing
other fundamental properties (e.g., diagnosability and opacity) in LWAs over monoids.

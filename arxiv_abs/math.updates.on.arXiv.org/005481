Using the formalism of stochastic embedding developed by [J. Cresson, D. Darses, J. Math. Phys.
48, 072703 (2007)], we study how the dynamics of the classical Newton equation for a force deriving
from a potential is deformed under the assumption that this equation can admit stochastic processes
as solutions. We focus on two denitions of a stochastic Newton's equation called dierential and
variational. We rst prove a stochastic virial theorem which is a natural generalization of the classical
case. The stochasticity modies the virial relation by adding a potential term called the induced
potential which corresponds in quantum mechanics to the Bohm potential. Moreover, the dierential
stochastic Newton equation naturally provides an action functional which sat-ises a stochastic
Hamilton-Jacobi equation. The real part of this equation corresponds to the classical Hamilton-Jacobi
equation with an extra potential term corresponding to the induced potential already observed
in the stochastic virial theorem. The induced potential has an explicit form depending on the density
of the stochastic processes solutions of the stochastic Newton equation. It is proved that this
density satises a nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. Applying this formalism for the Kepler
potential, one proves that the induced potential coincides with the ad-hoc ''dark potential''
used to recover a at rotation curve of spiral galaxies. We then discuss the application of the previous
formalism in the context of spiral galaxies following the proposal and computations given by [D.
Da Rocha and L. Nottale, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 16(4):565-595, 2003] where the emergence
of the ''dark potential'' is seen as a consequence of the fractality of space in the context of the
Scale relativity theory.

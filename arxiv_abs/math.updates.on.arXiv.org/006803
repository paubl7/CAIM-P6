The recently found hypergeometric multiple orthogonal polynomials on the step-line by Lima and
Loureiro are shown to be random walk polynomials. It is proven that the corresponding Jacobi matrix
and its transpose, which are nonnegative matrices and describe higher recurrence relations, can
be normalized to two stochastic matrices, dual to each other. Using the Christoffel-Darboux formula
on the step-line and the Poincar\'e theory for non-homogeneous recurrence relations it is proven
that both stochastic matrices are related by transposition in the large $n$ limit. These random
walks are beyond birth and death, as they describe a chain in where transitions to the two previous
states are allowed, or in the dual to the two next states.The corresponding Karlin-McGregor representation
formula is given for these new Markov chains. The regions of hypergeometric parameters where the
Markov chains are recurrent or transient are given. Stochastic factorizations, in terms of pure
birth and of pure death factors, for the corresponding Markov matrices of types I and II, are provided.Twelve
uniform Jacobi matrices and the corresponding random walks, related to a Jacobi matrix of Toeplitz
type, and theirs stochastic or semi-stochastic matrices (with sinks and sources), that describe
Markov chains beyond birth and death, are found and studied. One of these uniform stochastic cases,
which is a recurrent random walk, is the only hypergeometric multiple random walk having a uniform
stochastic factorization. The corresponding weights, Jacobi and Markov transition matrices
and sequences of type II multiple orthogonal polynomials are provided. Chain of Christoffel transformations
connecting the stochastic uniform tuples between them, and the semi-stochastic uniform tuples,
between them, are presented.

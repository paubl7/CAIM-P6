For a countably decomposable finite von Neumann algebra $\mathscr{R}$, we show that any choice
of a faithful normal tracial state on $\mathscr{R}$ engenders the same measure topology on $\mathscr{R}$
in the sense of Nelson (J.\ Func.\ Anal., 15 (1974), 103--116). Consequently it is justified to speak
of `the' measure topology of $\mathscr{R}$. Having made this observation, we extend the notion
of measure topology to general finite von Neumann algebras and denominate it the $\mathfrak{m}$-topology.\
We note that the procedure of $\mathfrak{m}$-completion yields Murray-von Neumann algebras in
a functorial manner and provides them with an intrinsic description as unital ordered complex topological
$*$-algebras. This enables the study of abstract Murray-von Neumann algebras avoiding reference
to a Hilbert space. Furthermore, it makes apparent the appropriate notion of Murray-von Neumann
subalgebras, and the intrinsic nature of the spectrum and point spectrum of elements, independent
of their ambient Murray-von Neumann algebra. In this context, we show the well-definedness of the
Borel function calculus for normal elements and use it along with approximation techniques in the
$\mathfrak{m}$-topology to transfer many standard operator inequalities involving bounded
self-adjoint operators to the setting of (unbounded) self-adjoint operators in Murray-von Neumann
algebras.\ On the algebraic side, Murray-von Neumann algebras have been described as the Ore localization
of finite von Neumann algebras with respect to their corresponding multiplicative subset of non-zero-divisors.
Our discussion reveals that, in addition, there are fundamental topological, order-theoretic
and analytical facets to their description.

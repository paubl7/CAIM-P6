The growth of e-commerce has created increasing complexity in logistics services. To remain competitive,
logistics and e-commerce companies are exploring new modes as supplements to traditional home
delivery, one of which is the self-service parcel locker. This paper studies a parcel locker location
problem where a company plans to introduce the locker service by locating locker facilities to attract
customers. The objective is to maximize the profit, accounting for the revenue and the cost of facilities.
To estimate the revenue, we use the threshold Luce model (TLM) to predict customers' likelihood
of using the locker service. We then propose a combinatorial optimization model and develop exact
solution methodologies that are practically implementable according to our extensive computational
experiments. In effect, our modeling framework generalizes the traditional facility location
problems based on the binomial logit model (BNL) and the multinomial logit model (MNL), both of which
impose strong and strict assumptions on the customer's choice sets. That is, they assume that the
choice sets will either contain only one facility or all facilities. In our numerical experiment,
we demonstrate that using the BNL and the MNL in the locker location problem could lead to, respectively,
pessimistic and optimistic revenue estimation. Consequently, the suggested location decisions
will be either conservative or aggressive. Our proposed model, by contrast, can effectively relax
these assumptions. Our results also reveal that the aggressive decision due to the use of the MNL
will incur an unnecessarily high facility cost that cannot be compensated by the additional revenue,
leading to profit loss that can be significant in various scenarios. Finally, we conduct sensitivity
analysis on the input parameters and draw additional implications.

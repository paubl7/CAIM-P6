Incomplete factorization is a widely used preconditioning technique for Krylov subspace methods
for solving large-scale sparse linear systems. Its multilevel variants, such as ILUPACK, are more
robust for many symmetric or unsymmetric linear systems than the traditional, single-level incomplete
LU (or ILU) techniques. However, the previous multilevel ILU techniques still lacked robustness
and efficiency for some large-scale saddle-point problems, which often arise from systems of partial
differential equations (PDEs). We introduce HILUCSI, or Hierarchical Incomplete LU-Crout with
Scalability-oriented and Inverse-based dropping. As a multilevel preconditioner, HILUCSI statically
and dynamically permutes individual rows and columns to the next level for deferred factorization.
Unlike ILUPACK, HILUCSI applies symmetric preprocessing techniques at the top levels but always
uses unsymmetric preprocessing and unsymmetric factorization at the coarser levels. The deferring
combined with mixed preprocessing enabled a unified treatment for nearly or partially symmetric
systems, and simplified the implementation by avoiding mixed 1\times1 and 2\times2 pivots for
symmetric indefinite systems. We show that this combination improves robustness for indefinite
systems without compromising efficiency. Furthermore, to enable superior efficiency for large-scale
systems with millions or more unknowns, HILUCSI introduces a scalability-oriented dropping in
conjunction with a variant of inverse-based dropping. We demonstrate the effectiveness of HILUCSI
for dozens of benchmark problems, including those from the mixed formulation of the Poisson equation,
Stokes equations, and Navier-Stokes equations. We also compare its performance with ILUPACK,
the supernodal ILUTP in SuperLU, and multithreaded direct solvers in PARDISO and MUMPS.

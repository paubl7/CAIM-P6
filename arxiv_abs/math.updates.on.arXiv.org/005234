Low-rank matrix estimation is a canonical problem that finds numerous applications in signal processing,
machine learning and imaging science. A popular approach in practice is to factorize the matrix
into two compact low-rank factors, and then optimize these factors directly via simple iterative
methods such as gradient descent and alternating minimization. Despite nonconvexity, recent
literatures have shown that these simple heuristics in fact achieve linear convergence when initialized
properly for a growing number of problems of interest. However, upon closer examination, existing
approaches can still be computationally expensive especially for ill-conditioned matrices:
the convergence rate of gradient descent depends linearly on the condition number of the low-rank
matrix, while the per-iteration cost of alternating minimization is often prohibitive for large
matrices. The goal of this paper is to set forth a competitive algorithmic approach dubbed Scaled
Gradient Descent (ScaledGD) which can be viewed as pre-conditioned or diagonally-scaled gradient
descent, where the pre-conditioners are adaptive and iteration-varying with a minimal computational
overhead. With tailored variants for low-rank matrix sensing, robust principal component analysis
and matrix completion, we theoretically show that ScaledGD achieves the best of both worlds: it
converges linearly at a rate independent of the condition number of the low-rank matrix similar
as alternating minimization, while maintaining the low per-iteration cost of gradient descent.
Our analysis is also applicable to general loss functions that are restricted strongly convex and
smooth over low-rank matrices. To the best of our knowledge, ScaledGD is the first algorithm that
provably has such properties over a wide range of low-rank matrix estimation tasks.

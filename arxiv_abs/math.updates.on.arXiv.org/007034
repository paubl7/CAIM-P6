Let $\kk$ be an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero and $\KK$ a finitely generated
field over $\kk$. Let $\Sigma$ be a central simple $\KK$-algebra, $X$ a normal projective model
of $\KK$ and $\Lambda$ a sheaf of maximal $\Osh_X$-orders in $\Sigma$. There is a ramification $\QQ$-divisor
$\Delta$ on $X$, which is related to the canonical bimodule $\omega_\Lambda$ by an adjunction formula.
It only depends on the class of $\Sigma$ in the Brauer group of $\KK$. When the numerical abundance
conjecture holds true, or when $\Sigma$ is a central simple algebra, we show that the Gelfand-Kirillov
dimension (or GK dimension) of the canonical ring of $\Lambda$ is one more than the Iitaka dimension
(or D-dimension) of the log pair $(X,\Delta)$. In the case that $\Sigma$ is a division algebra, we
further show that this GK dimension is also one more than the transcendence degree of the division
algebra of degree zero fractions of the canonical ring of $\Lambda$. We prove that these dimensions
are birationally invariant when the b-log pair determined by the ramification divisor has b-canonical
singularities. In that case we refer to the Iitaka (or D-dimension) of $(X,\Delta)$ as the Kodaira
dimension of the order $\Lambda$. For this, we establish birational invariance of the Kodaira dimension
of b-log pairs with b-canonical singularities. We also show that the Kodaira dimension can not decrease
for an embedding of central simple algebras, finite dimensional over their centres, which induces
a Galois extension of their centres, and satisfies a condition on the ramification which we call
an effective embedding. For example, this condition holds if the target central simple algebra
has the property that its period equals its index.

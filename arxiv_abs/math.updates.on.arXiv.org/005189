For the Newtonian (gravitational) $n$-body problem in the Euclidean $d$-dimensional space, the
simplest possible solutions are provided by those rigid motions (homographic solutions) in which
each body moves along a Keplerian orbit and the configuration of the $n$-body is a constant up to rotations
and scalings named \textit{central configuration}. For $d\leq 3$, the only possible homographic
motions are those given by central configurations. For $d \geq 4$ instead, new possibilities arise
due to the higher complexity of the orthogonal group $O(d)$, as observed by Albouy and Chenciner.
For instance, in $\mathbb R^4$ it is possible to rotate in two mutually orthogonal planes with different
angular velocities. This produces a new balance between gravitational forces and centrifugal
forces providing new periodic and quasi-periodic motions. So, for $d\geq 4$ there is a wider class
of $S$-\textit{balanced configurations} (containing the central ones) providing simple solutions
of the $n$-body problem, which can be characterized as well through critical point theory. In this
paper, we first provide a lower bound on the number of balanced (non-central) configurations in
$\mathbb R^d$, for arbitrary $d\geq 4$, and establish a version of the $45^\circ$-theorem for balanced
configurations, thus answering some questions raised by Moeckel. Also, a careful study of the asymptotics
of the coefficients of the Poincar\'e polynomial of the collision free configuration sphere will
enable us to derive some rather unexpected qualitative consequences on the count of $S$-balanced
configurations. In the last part of the paper, we focus on the case $d=4$ and provide a lower bound
on the number of periodic and quasi-periodic motions of the gravitational $n$-body problem which
improves a previous celebrated result of McCord.

Quasi-abelian categories are abundant in functional analysis and representation theory. It is
known that a quasi-abelian category $\mathcal{E}$ is a cotilting torsionfree class of an abelian
category. In fact, this property characterizes quasi-abelian categories. This ambient abelian
category is derived equivalent to the category $\mathcal{E}$, and can be constructed as the heart
$\mathcal{LH}(\mathcal{E})$ of a $\operatorname{t}$-structure on the bounded derived category
$\operatorname{D^b}(\mathcal{E})$ or as the localization of the category of monomorphisms in
$\mathcal{E}.$ However, there are natural examples of categories in functional analysis which
are not quasi-abelian, but merely one-sided quasi-abelian or even weaker. Examples are the category
of $\operatorname{LB}$-spaces or the category of complete Hausdorff locally convex spaces. In
this paper, we consider additive regular categories as a generalization of quasi-abelian categories
that covers the aforementioned examples. These categories can be characterized as pre-torsionfree
subcategories of abelian categories. As for quasi-abelian categories, we show that such an ambient
abelian category of an additive regular category $\mathcal{E}$ can be found as the heart of a $\operatorname{t}$-structure
on the bounded derived category $\operatorname{D^b}(\mathcal{E})$, or as the localization of
the category of monomorphisms of $\mathcal{E}$. In our proof of this last construction, we formulate
and prove a version of Auslander's formula for additive regular categories. Whereas a quasi-abelian
category is an exact category in a natural way, an additive regular category has a natural one-sided
exact structure. Such a one-sided exact category can be 2-universally embedded into its exact hull.
We show that the exact hull of an additive regular category is again an additive regular category.

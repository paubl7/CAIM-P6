We consider the algorithmic problem of finding a near-optimal solution for the number partitioning
problem (NPP). The NPP appears in many applications, including the design of randomized controlled
trials, multiprocessor scheduling, and cryptography; and is also of theoretical significance.
It possesses a so-called statistical-to-computational gap: when its input $X$ has distribution
$\mathcal{N}(0,I_n)$, its optimal value is $\Theta(\sqrt{n}2^{-n})$ w.h.p.; whereas the best
polynomial-time algorithm achieves an objective value of only $2^{-\Theta(\log^2 n)}$, w.h.p.
In this paper, we initiate the study of the nature of this gap. Inspired by insights from statistical
physics, we study the landscape of NPP and establish the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP),
an intricate geometric property which is known to be a rigorous evidence of an algorithmic hardness
for large classes of algorithms. By leveraging the OGP, we establish that (a) any sufficiently stable
algorithm, appropriately defined, fails to find a near-optimal solution with energy below $2^{-\omega(n
\log^{-1/5} n)}$; and (b) a very natural MCMC dynamics fails to find near-optimal solutions. Our
simulations suggest that the state of the art algorithm achieving $2^{-\Theta(\log^2 n)}$ is indeed
stable, but formally verifying this is left as an open problem. OGP regards the overlap structure
of $m-$tuples of solutions achieving a certain objective value. When $m$ is constant we prove the
presence of OGP in the regime $2^{-\Theta(n)}$, and the absence of it in the regime $2^{-o(n)}$.
Interestingly, though, by considering overlaps with growing values of $m$ we prove the presence
of the OGP up to the level $2^{-\omega(\sqrt{n\log n})}$. Our proof of the failure of stable algorithms
at values $2^{-\omega(n \log^{-1/5} n)}$ employs methods from Ramsey Theory from the extremal
combinatorics, and is of independent interest.

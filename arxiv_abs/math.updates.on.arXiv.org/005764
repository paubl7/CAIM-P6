In contrast to the many theoretical studies on the transmission of human-mosquitoes malaria infection,
few studies have considered a multiple structure model formulations including (i) the chronological
age of humans and mosquitoes population, (ii) the time since humans and mosquitoes are infected
and (iii) humans waning immunity (i.e., the progressive loss of protective antibodies after recovery).
Such structural variables are well documented to be fundamental for the transmission of human-mosquitoes
malaria infections. Here we formulate an age-structured model accounting for the three structural
variables. Using integrated semigroups theory, we first handle the well-posedness of the model
proposed. We also investigate the existence of model's steady-states. A disease-free equilibrium
always exists while the existence of endemic equilibria is discussed. We derive the threshold R0
(the basic reproduction number). The expression of the R0 obtained here particularly highlight
the effect of above structural variables on key important epidemiological traits of the human-vector
association. This includes, humans and mosquitoes transmission probability and survival rates.
Next, we derive a necessary and sufficient condition that implies the bifurcation of an endemic
equilibrium. In some configuration where the age-structure of the human population is neglected,
we show that, depending on the sign of some constant Cbif given by the parameters, a bifurcation occurs
at R0 = 1 that is either forward or backward. In the former case, it means that there exists a (unique)
endemic equilibrium if and only if R0 > 1. In the latter case, no endemic equilibrium exists for R0<<
1 small enough, a unique exists if R0 > 1 while multiple endemic equilibria exist when 0 <<R0 < 1 close
enough to 1.

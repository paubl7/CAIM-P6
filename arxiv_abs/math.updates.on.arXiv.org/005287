The energy and geometry of maximizing paths in integrable last passage percolation models are governed
by the characteristic KPZ scaling exponents of one-third and two-thirds. When represented in scaled
coordinates that respect these exponents, this random field of paths may be viewed as a complex energy
landscape. We investigate the structure of valleys and connecting pathways in this landscape.
The routed weight profile $\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}$ associates to $x \in \mathbb{R}$ the maximum
scaled energy obtainable by a path whose scaled journey from $(0,0)$ to $(0,1)$ passes through the
point $(x,1/2)$. Developing tools of Brownian Gibbs analysis from [Ham16] and [CHH19], we prove
an assertion of strong similarity of this profile for Brownian last passage percolation to Brownian
motion of rate two on the unit-order scale. A sharp estimate on the rarity that two macroscopically
different routes in the energy landscape offer energies close to the global maximum results. We
prove robust assertions concerning modulus of continuity for the energy and geometry of scaled
maximizing paths, that develop the results and approach of [HS20], delivering estimates valid
on all scales above the microscopic. The geometry of excursions of near ground states about the maximizing
path is investigated: indeed, we estimate the energetic shortfall of scaled paths forced to closely
mimic the geometry of the maximizing route while remaining disjoint from it. We also provide bounds
on the approximate gradient of the maximizing path, viewed as a function, ruling out sharp steep
movement down to the microscopic scale. Our results find application in a companion study [GH20a]
of the stability, and fragility, of last passage percolation under a dynamical perturbation.

For a partition $\underline{\lambda} = (\lambda_{1}^{\rho _1}>\lambda_{2}^{\rho _2}>\lambda_{3}^{\rho
_3}>\ldots>\lambda_{k}^{\rho _k})$ and its associated finite $\mathcal{R}$-module $\mathcal{A}_{\underline{\lambda}}=\underset{i=1}{\overset{k}{\oplus}}
(\mathcal{R}/\pi^{\lambda_i}\mathcal{R})^{\rho_i}$, where $\mathcal{R}$ is a discrete valuation
ring, with maximal ideal generated by a uniformizing element $\pi$, having finite residue field
${\bf k}=\mathcal{R}/\pi\mathcal{R}\cong \mathbb{F}_q$, the number of orbits of pairs $n_{\underline{\lambda}}(q)=
\mid \mathcal{G}_{\underline{\lambda}}\backslash \big(\mathcal{A}_{\underline{\lambda}}\times
\mathcal{A}_{\underline{\lambda}}\big)\mid$ for the diagonal action of the automorphism group
$\mathcal{G}_{\underline{\lambda}}= Aut(\mathcal{A}_{\underline{\lambda}})$, is a polynomial
in $q$ with integer coefficients. It has been conjectured that these coefficients are in fact non-negative.
In this article we mention a conditional method to prove this positivity conjecture, that is, a condition,
which when holds, proves the non-negativity of the coefficients. As a consequence, we prove that
the positivity conjecture holds for certain class of finite $\mathcal{R}$-modules with their
associated partitions. Moreover we give a combinatorial interpretation of the coefficients of
certain polynomials which are obtained by counting orbits for certain group actions on $\mathcal{A}_{\underline{\lambda}}$
and $\pi\mathcal{A}_{\underline{\lambda}}$. Also in this article we make a significant progress
towards proving this positivity conjecture in general without any assumption/condition. We actually
prove that the positivity conjecture for partitions which has all their parts distinct implies
the positivity conjecture in general. Slightly more details are mentioned in the abstract page
of the article.

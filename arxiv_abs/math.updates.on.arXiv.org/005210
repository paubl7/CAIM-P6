Motivated by connections to random matrices, Littlewood-Richardson coefficients and tilings,
we study random discrete concave functions on an equilateral lattice. We show that such functions
having a periodic Hessian of a fixed average value $- s$ concentrate around a quadratic function,
if $s$ satisfies certain conditions. We consider the set of all concave functions $g$ on an equilateral
lattice $\mathbb L$ that when shifted by an element of $n \mathbb L$ have a periodic discrete Hessian,
with period $n \mathbb L$. We subtract a quadratic of the same Hessian $- s$; the difference is then
periodic with period $n \mathbb L$, and view this as a mean zero function $g$ on the vertices $V(\mathbb{T}_n)$
of a torus $\mathbb{T}_n := \frac{\mathbb{Z}}{n\mathbb{Z}}\times \frac{\mathbb{Z}}{n\mathbb{Z}}$
whose Hessian is dominated by $s$. The resulting set of functions forms a convex polytope $P_n(s)$.
The $\ell_\infty$ diameter of $P_n(s)$ is bounded below by $c(s) n^2$, where $c(s)$ is a positive
constant depending only on $s$. Our first result is that, if the limiting differential entropy per
vertex $\log \mathbf{f}(s)$ is strictly concave at $s$, then for any $\epsilon_0 > 0$, the normalized
Lebesgue measure of all points in $P_n(s)$ that are not contained in an $\ell_\infty-$ball of sidelength
$ \epsilon_0 n^2$, tends to $0$ as $n$ tends to $\infty$. Our second result is that if $w$ is a superdifferential
of $\mathbf{f}(s)$, identified with a vector in $\mathbb{R}^3$ in a specified way, and $$w_0^2
+ w_1^2 + w_2^2 < 2\left(w_0 w_1 + w_1 w_2 + w_2 w_0\right),$$ then for any $\epsilon > 0,$ we have $$\lim_{n
\rightarrow 0} \mathbb{P}\left[\|g\|_\infty > n^{\frac{15}{8} + \epsilon}\right] = 0$$ if $g$
is sampled from the uniform measure on $P_n(s)$.

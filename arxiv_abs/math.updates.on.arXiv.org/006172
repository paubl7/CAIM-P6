In this paper we study the distributed average consensus problem in multi-agent systems with directed
communication links that are subject to quantized information flow. Specifically, we present
and analyze a distributed averaging algorithm which operates exclusively with quantized values
(i.e., the information stored, processed and exchanged between neighboring agents is subject
to deterministic uniform quantization) and relies on event-driven updates (e.g., to reduce energy
consumption, communication bandwidth, network congestion, and/or processor usage). The main
idea of the proposed algorithm is that each node (i) models its initial state as two quantized fractions
which have numerators equal to the node's initial state and denominators equal to one, and (ii) transmits
one fraction randomly while it keeps the other stored. Then, every time it receives one or more fractions,
it averages their numerators with the numerator of the fraction it stored, and then transmits them
to randomly selected out-neighbors. We characterize the properties of the proposed distributed
algorithm and show that its execution, on any static and strongly connected digraph, allows each
agent to reach in finite time a fixed state that is equal (within one quantisation level) to the average
of the initial states. We extend the operation of the algorithm to achieve finite-time convergence
in the presence of a dynamic directed communication topology subject to some connectivity conditions.
Finally, we provide examples to illustrate the operation, performance, and potential advantages
of the proposed algorithm. We compare against state-of-the-art quantized average consensus algorithms
and show that our algorithm's convergence speed significantly outperforms most existing protocols.

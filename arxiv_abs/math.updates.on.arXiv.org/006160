We develop a quenched thermodynamic formalism for open random dynamical systems generated by finitely
branched, piecewise-monotone mappings of the interval. The openness refers to the presence of
holes in the interval, which terminate trajectories once they enter; the holes may also be random.
Our random driving is generated by an invertible, ergodic, measure-preserving transformation
$\sigma$ on a probability space $(\Omega,\mathscr{F},m)$. For each $\omega\in\Omega$ we associate
a piecewise-monotone, surjective map $T_\omega:I\to I$, and a hole $H_\omega\subset I$; the map
$T_\omega$, the random potential $\varphi_\omega$, and the hole $H_\omega$ generate the corresponding
open transfer operator $\mathcal{L}_\omega$. For a contracting potential, under a condition
on the open random dynamics in the spirit of Liverani--Maume-Deschamps, we prove there exists a
unique random probability measure $\nu_\omega$ supported on the survivor set ${X}_{\omega,\infty}$
satisfying $\nu_{\sigma(\omega)}(\mathcal{L}_\omega f)=\lambda_\omega\nu_\omega(f)$.
We also prove the existence of a unique random family of functions $q_\omega$ that satisfy $\mathcal{L}_\omega
q_\omega=\lambda_\omega q_{\sigma(\omega)}$. These yield an ergodic random invariant measure
$\mu=\nu q$ supported on the global survivor set, while $q$ combined with the random closed conformal
measure yields a unique random absolutely continuous conditional invariant measure (RACCIM)
$\eta$ supported on $I$. We prove quasi-compactness of the transfer operator cocycle and exponential
decay of correlations for $\mu$. Finally, the escape rates of the random closed conformal measure
and the RACCIM $\eta$ coincide, and are given in terms of the expected pressure, as is the Hausdorff
dimension of the surviving set $X_{\omega,\infty}$. We provide examples of our general theory,
including random $\beta$-transformations and random Lasota-Yorke maps.

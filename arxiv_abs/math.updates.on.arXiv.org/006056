Physical platforms such as trapped ions suffer from coherent noise where errors manifest as rotations
about a particular axis and can accumulate overtime. We investigate passive mitigation through
decoherence free subspaces, requiring the noise to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code,
and to act as the logical identity operator on the protected information. Thus, we develop conditions
for all transversal $Z$-rotations to preserve the code space of a stabilizer code, which require
the existence of a large number of weight-$2$ $Z$-stabilizers, and together, these weight-$2$
$Z$-stabilizers generate a direct product of single-parity-check codes. By adjusting the size
of these components, we are able to construct a large family of QECC codes, oblivious to coherent
noise, that includes the $[[4L^2, 1, 2L]]$ Shor codes. Moreover, given $M$ even and given any $[[n,k,d]]$
stabilizer code, we can construct an $[[Mn, k, \ge d]]$ stabilizer code that is oblivious to coherent
noise. The MacWilliams Identities play a central role in the technical analysis, and classical
coding theorists may be interested in connections to classical codes with all weights divisible
by some integer $s$. If we require that transversal $Z$-rotations preserve the code space only up
to some finite level $l$ in the Clifford hierarchy, then we can construct higher level gates necessary
for universal quantum computation. The $Z$-stabilizers supported on each non-zero $X$-component
form a classical binary code C, which is required to contain a self-dual code, and the classical Gleason's
theorem constrains its weight enumerator. The conditions for a stabilizer code being preserved
by transversal $2\pi/2^l$ $Z$-rotations at $4 \le l \le l_{\max} <\infty$ level in the Clifford
hierarchy lead to generalizations of Gleason's theorem that may be of independent interest to classical
coding theorists.

An intrinsic essence of sounds in music is the evolution of their qualitative types while in mathematics
we interpret each qualitative change by a bifurcation. Hopf bifurcation is an important venue to
generate a signal with an arbitrary frequency. Hence, the investigations of musical sounds via
bifurcation control theory are long-overdue and natural contributions. In this paper, we address
the tone coloring of sounds by dynamical modeling of spectral and temporal envelopes. Multiple
number of leading harmonic partials of a note (modulo a hearing sound velocity threshold) are attributed
into an Eulerian differential system with n-tuple Hopf singularity. The qualitative evolution
of the temporal envelop is then simulated over a set of consecutive time-intervals via bifurcation
control of the differential system. For an instance, our proposed approach is applied on audio C#4
files obtained from piano and violin. Fourier analysis is used to generate the amplitude spectral
vectors. Then, we associate each amplitude spectral vector with an Eulerian flow-invariant leaf.
Bifurcation control suffices to accurately construct the desired spectral and amplitude envelopes
of musical notes. These correspond with a rich bifurcation scenarios involving Clifford toral
manifolds for the Eulerian differential system. In order to reduce the technicalities, we employ
several reduction techniques and use one bifurcation parameter. We show how different ordered
sets of elementary bifurcations such as pitchfork and (double) saddle-node bifurcations are associated
with the qualitative temporal envelop changes of a C]4 played by either a piano or a violin. A complete
hysteresis type cycle is observed within the temporal envelop bifurcations of the C#4 played by
violin.

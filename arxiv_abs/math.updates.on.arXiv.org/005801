In this article, we prove various illposedness results for the Cauchy problem for the incompressible
Hall- and electron-magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) equations without resistivity. These PDEs are
fluid descriptions of plasmas, where the effect of collisions is neglected (no resistivity), while
the motion of the electrons relative to the ions (Hall current term) is taken into account. The Hall
current term endows the magnetic field equation with a quasilinear dispersive character, which
is key to our mechanism for illposedness. Perhaps the most striking conclusion of this article is
that the Cauchy problems for the Hall-MHD (either viscous or inviscid) and the electron-MHD equations,
under one translational symmetry, are ill-posed near the trivial solution in any sufficiently
high regularity Sobolev space and even in Gevrey spaces. This result holds despite obvious wellposedness
of the linearized equations near the trivial solution, as well as conservation of the nonlinear
energy, by which the $L^{2}$ norm (energy) of the solution stays constant in time. The core illposedness
mechanism is degeneration of certain high frequency wave packet solutions to the linearization
around a class of linearly degenerate stationary solutions of these equations, which are essentially
dispersive equations with degenerate principal symbols. The method developed in this work is sharp
and robust, in that we also prove nonlinear $H^{s}$-illposedness in the presence of fractional
dissipation of any order less than 1, matching known wellposedness results. The results in this
article are complemented by a companion work, where we provide geometric conditions on the initial
magnetic field that ensure wellposedness(!) of the Cauchy problem. In particular, in stark contrast
to the results here, it is shown in the companion work that the nonlinear Cauchy problems are well-posed
near any nonzero constant magnetic field.

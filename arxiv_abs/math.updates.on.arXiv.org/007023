Recent theoretical and experimental advances show that the inertia of magnetization emerges at
sub-picoseconds and contributes to the ultrafast magnetization dynamics which cannot be captured
intrinsically by the LLG equation. Therefore, as a generalization, the inertial Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
(iLLG) equation is proposed to model the ultrafast magnetization dynamics. Mathematically, the
LLG equation is a nonlinear system of parabolic type with (possible) degeneracy. However, the iLLG
equation is a nonlinear system of mixed hyperbolic-parabolic type with degeneracy, and exhibits
more complicated structures. It behaves like a hyperbolic system at the sub-picosecond scale while
behaves like a parabolic system at larger timescales. Such hybrid behaviors impose additional
difficulties on designing numerical methods for the iLLG equation. In this work, we propose a second-order
semi-implicit scheme to solve the iLLG equation. The second temporal derivative of magnetization
is approximated by the standard centered difference scheme and the first derivative is approximated
by the midpoint scheme involving three time steps. The nonlinear terms are treated semi-implicitly
using one-sided interpolation with the second-order accuracy. At each step, the unconditionally
unique solvability of the unsymmetric linear system of equations in the proposed method is proved
with a detailed discussion on the condition number. Numerically, the second-order accuracy in
both time and space is verified. Using the proposed method, the inertial effect of ferromagnetics
is observed in micromagnetics simulations at small timescales, in consistency with the hyperbolic
property of the model at sub-picoseconds. For long time simulations, the results of the iLLG model
are in nice agreements with those of the LLG model, in consistency with the parabolic feature of the
iLLG model at larger timescales.

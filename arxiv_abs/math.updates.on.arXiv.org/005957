In this work, we consider the fractional obstacle problem with a given obstacle $\psi$ in a bounded
Lipschitz domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^{d}$, such that $\mathbb{K}_\psi^s=\{v\in H^s_0(\Omega):v\geq\psi
\text{ a.e. in }\Omega\}\neq\emptyset$, given by \[u\in\mathbb{K}_\psi^s:\quad\langle\mathcal{L}_Au,v-u\rangle\geq\langle
F,v-u\rangle\quad\forall v\in\mathbb{K}^s_\psi,\] for $F$ in $H^{-s}(\Omega)$, the dual space
of the fractional Sobolev space $H^s_0(\Omega)$, $0<s<1$. The nonlocal operator $\mathcal{L}_A:H^s_0(\Omega)\to
H^{-s}(\Omega)$ is defined with the distributional Riesz fractional derivatives and with a measurable,
bounded, positive definite matrix $A(x):\mathbb{R}^d\to\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$, by $\mathcal{L}_Au=-D^s\cdot(AD^su)$.
We show that the corresponding bilinear form $\mathcal{E}_A(u,v)$ is a (not necessarily symmetric)
Dirichlet form that corresponds to a nonlocal integral operator with a well defined integral kernel
$k_A(x,y)$. We then consider obstacle-type problems involving $\mathcal{L}_A$ with one or two
obstacles, as well as the $N$-membranes problem, thereby deriving several results, such as the
weak maximum principle, comparison properties, approximation by bounded penalization and also
the Lewy-Stampacchia inequalities, similarly to the classical obstacle problem which is obtained
at the limit $s\to1$. This provides regularity of the solutions, including a global estimate in
$L^\infty(\Omega)$, local H\"older regularity of the solutions when $A$ is symmetric, and local
regularity in fractional Sobolev spaces when $A$ is the identity and $\mathcal{L}_A=(-\Delta)^s$
corresponds to fractional $s$-Laplacian obstacle-type problems. These novel results are complemented
with the extension of the Lewy-Stampacchia inequalities to the order dual of $H^s_0(\Omega)$ and
some remarks on the associated $s$-capacity and the $s$-fractional obstacle problem.

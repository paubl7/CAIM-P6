We prove a $p$-converse theorem for elliptic curves $E/\mathbb{Q}$ with complex multiplication
by the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ of an imaginary quadratic field $K$ in which $p$ is ramified.
Namely, letting $r_p = \mathrm{corank}_{\mathbb{Z}_p}\mathrm{Sel}_{p^{\infty}}(E/\mathbb{Q})$,
we show that $r_p \le 1 \implies \mathrm{rank}_{\mathbb{Z}}E(\mathbb{Q}) = \mathrm{ord}_{s
= 1}L(E,s) = r_p$ and $\#\mathrm{Sha}(E/\mathbb{Q}) < \infty$. In particular, this has applications
to two classical problems of arithmetic. First, it resolves Sylvester's conjecture on rational
sums of cubes, showing that for all primes $\ell \equiv 4,7,8 \pmod{9}$, there exists $(x,y) \in
\mathbb{Q}^{\oplus 2}$ such that $x^3 + y^3 = \ell$. Second, combined with work of Smith, it resolves
the congruent number problem in 100\% of cases and establishes Goldfeld's conjecture on ranks of
quadratic twists for the congruent number family. The method for showing the above $p$-converse
theorem relies on new interplays between Iwasawa theory for imaginary quadratic fields at nonsplit
primes and relative $p$-adic Hodge theory. In particular, we show that a certain de Rham period $q_{\mathrm{dR}}$
introduced by the author in previous work can be used to construct analytic continuations of ordinary
Serre-Tate expansions on the Igusa tower to the infinite-level overconvergent locus. Using this
coordinate, one can construct 1-variable measures for Hecke characters and CM-newforms satisfying
a new type of interpolation property. Moreover, one can relate the Iwasawa module of elliptic units
to these anticyclotomic measures via a new "Coleman map", which is roughly the $q_{\mathrm{dR}}$-expansion
of the Coleman power series map. Using this, we formulate and prove a new Rubin-type main conjecture
for elliptic units, which is eventually related to Heegner points in order to prove the $p$-converse
theorem.

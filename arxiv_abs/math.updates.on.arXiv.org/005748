A new set of multiple orthogonal polynomials of both type I and type II with respect to two weight functions
involving Gauss' hypergeometric function on the interval $(0,1)$ is studied. This type of polynomials
have direct applications in the investigation of singular values of products of Ginibre matrices,
in the analysis of rational solutions to Painlev\'e equations and are connected with branched continued
fractions and total positivity problems in combinatorics. The pair of orthogonality measures
is shown to be a Nikishin system and to satisfy a matrix Pearson-type differential equation. The
focus is on the polynomials whose indexes lie on the step line, for which it is shown that differentiation
on the variable gives a shift on the parameters, therefore satisfying Hahn's property. We obtain
a Rodrigues-type formula for type I, while a more detailed characterisation is given for the type
II polynomials (aka $2$-orthogonal polynomials) which include: an explicit expression as a terminating
hypergeometric series, a third-order differential equation, and a third-order recurrence relation.
The asymptotic behaviour of their recurrence coefficients mimics those of Jacobi-Pi\~neiro polynomials,
based on which, their zero asymptotic distribution and a Mehler-Heine asymptotic formula near
the origin are given. Particular choices on the parameters degenerate in some known systems such
as special cases of the Jacobi-Pi\~neiro polynomials, Jacobi-type $2$-orthogonal polynomials,
and components of the cubic decomposition of threefold symmetric Hahn-classical polynomials.
Equally considered are confluence relations to other known polynomial sets, such as multiple orthogonal
polynomials with respect to Tricomi functions.

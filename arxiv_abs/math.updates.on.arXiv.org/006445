In this thesis, we consider the Wasserstein barycenter problem of discrete probability measures
from computational and statistical sides in two scenarios: (I) the measures are given and we need
to compute their Wasserstein barycenter, and (ii) the measures are generated from a probability
distribution and we need to calculate the population barycenter of the distribution defined by
the notion of Fr\'echet mean. The statistical focus is estimating the sample size of measures necessary
to calculate an approximation for Fr\'echet mean (barycenter) of a probability distribution with
a given precision. For empirical risk minimization approaches, the question of the regularization
is also studied together with proposing a new regularization which contributes to the better complexity
bounds in comparison with quadratic regularization. The computational focus is developing algorithms
for calculating Wasserstein barycenters: both primal and dual algorithms which can be executed
in a decentralized manner. The motivation for dual approaches is closed-forms for the dual formulation
of entropy-regularized Wasserstein distances and their derivatives, whereas the primal formulation
has closed-form expression only in some cases, e.g., for Gaussian measures. Moreover, the dual
oracle returning the gradient of the dual representation for entropy-regularized Wasserstein
distance can be computed for a cheaper price in comparison with the primal oracle returning the gradient
of the entropy-regularized Wasserstein distance. The number of dual oracle calls, in this case,
will also be less, i.e., the square root of the number of primal oracle calls. This explains the successful
application of the first-order dual approaches for the Wasserstein barycenter problem.

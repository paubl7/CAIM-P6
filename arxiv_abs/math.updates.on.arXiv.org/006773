We consider the time-dependent dynamical system $\ddot{q}^{a}= -\Gamma_{bc}^{a}\dot{q}^{b}\dot{q}^{c}-\omega(t)Q^{a}(q)$
where $\omega(t)$ is a non-zero arbitrary function and the connection coefficients $\Gamma^{a}_{bc}$
are computed from the kinetic metric (kinetic energy) of the system. In order to determine the quadratic
first integrals (QFIs) $I$ we assume that $I=K_{ab}\dot{q}^{a} \dot{q}^{b} +K_{a}\dot{q}^{a}+K$
where the unknown coefficients $K_{ab}, K_{a}, K$ are tensors depending on $t, q^{a}$ and impose
the condition $\frac{dI}{dt}=0$. This condition leads to a system of partial differential equations
(PDEs) involving the quantities $K_{ab}, K_{a}, K,$ $\omega(t)$ and $Q^{a}(q)$. From these PDEs,
it follows that $K_{ab}$ is a Killing tensor (KT) of the kinetic metric. We use the KT $K_{ab}$ in two
ways: a. We assume a general polynomial form in $t$ both for $K_{ab}$ and $K_{a}$; b. We express $K_{ab}$
in a basis of the KTs of order 2 of the kinetic metric assuming the coefficients to be functions of $t$.
In both cases, this leads to a new system of PDEs whose solution requires that we specify either $\omega(t)$
or $Q^{a}(q)$. We consider first that $\omega(t)$ is a general polynomial in $t$ and find that in
this case the dynamical system admits two independent QFIs which we collect in a Theorem. Next, we
specify the quantities $Q^{a}(q)$ to be the generalized time-dependent Kepler potential $V=-\frac{\omega
(t)}{r^{\nu}}$ and determine the functions $\omega(t)$ for which QFIs are admitted. We extend
the discussion to the non-linear differential equation $\ddot{x}=-\omega(t)x^{\mu }+\phi (t)\dot{x}$
$(\mu \neq -1)$ and compute the relation between the coefficients $\omega(t), \phi(t)$ so that
QFIs are admitted. We apply the results to determine the QFIs of the generalized Lane-Emden equation.

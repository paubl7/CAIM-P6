A noteworthy aspect in blood flow modeling is the definition of the mechanical interaction between
the fluid flow and the biological structure that contains it, namely the vessel wall. It has been
demonstrated that the addition of a viscous contribution to the mechanical characterization of
vessels brings positive results when compared to in-vivo measurements. In this context, the implementation
of boundary conditions able to keep memory of the viscoelastic contribution of vessel walls assumes
an important role, especially when dealing with large circulatory systems. In this work, viscoelasticity
is taken into account in entire networks via the Standard Linear Solid Model. The implementation
of the viscoelastic contribution at boundaries, namely inlet, outlet and junction, is carried
out considering the natively hyperbolic nature of the mathematical model. A non-linear system
is established based on the definition of a specific Riemann Problem at junctions. Basic junction
test cases are analyzed, such as a trivial 2-vessels junction, for both a generic artery and a generic
vein, and a simple 3-vessels junction, considering an aortic bifurcation scenario. The chosen
IMEX-SSP2 Finite Volume scheme is demonstrated to be second-order accurate in the whole domain
and well-balanced, even when including junctions. Two benchmark arterial networks are then implemented,
differing in number of vessels and in viscoelastic parameters. Comparison of the results obtained
in the two networks underlines the high sensitivity of the model to the chosen viscoelastic parameters.
In these numerical tests, the network-wise conservation of the contribution provided by the viscoelastic
characterization of vessel walls is assessed. Finally, numerical results of pressure waveforms
in the common carotid artery and in the femoral artery of the second network simulated are compared
with in-vivo data.

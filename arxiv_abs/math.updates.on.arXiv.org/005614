A new class of locally unital and locally finite dimensional algebras $A$ over an arbitrary algebraically
closed field is discovered. Each of them admits an upper finite weakly triangular decomposition,
a generalization of an upper finite triangular decomposition. Any locally unital algebra which
admits an upper finite Cartan decomposition is Morita equivalent to some special locally unital
algebra $A$ which admits an upper finite weakly triangular decomposition. It is established that
the category $A$-lfdmod of locally finite dimensional left $A$-modules is an upper finite fully
stratified category in the sense of Brundan-Stroppel. Moreover, $A$ is semisimple if and only if
its centralizer subalgebras associated to certain idempotent elements are semisimple. Furthermore,
certain endofunctors are defined and give categorical actions of some Lie algebras on the subcategory
of $A$-lfdmod consisting of all objects which have a finite standard filtration. In the case $A$
is the locally unital algebra associated to one of cyclotomic oriented Brauer categories, cyclotomic
Brauer categories and cyclotomic Kauffman categories, $A$ admits an upper finite weakly triangular
decomposition. This leads to categorifications of representations of the classical limits of
coideal algebras, which come from all integrable highest weight modules of $\mathfrak {sl}_\infty$
or $\hat {\mathfrak{sl}}_e$. Finally, we study representations of $A$ associated to either cyclotomic
Brauer categories or cyclotomic Kauffman categories in details, including explicit criteria
on the semisimplicity of $A$ over an arbitrary field, and on $A$-lfdmod being upper finite highest
weight category in the sense of Brundan-Stroppel, and on Morita equivalence between $A$ and direct
sum of infinitely many (degenerate) cyclotomic Hecke algebras.

Graph complements G(n) of cyclic graphs are circulant, vertex-transitive, claw-free, strongly
regular, Hamiltonian graphs with a Z(n) symmetry, Shannon capacity 2 and known Wiener and Harary
index. There is an explicit spectral zeta function and tree or forest data. The forest-tree ratio
converges to e. The graphs G(n) are Cayley graphs and so Platonic with isomorphic unit spheres G(n-3)^+,
complements of path graphs. G(3d+3) are homotop to wedge sums of two d-spheres and G(3d+2),G(3d+4)
are homotop to d-spheres, G(3d+1)^+ are contractible, G(3d+2)^+,G(3d+3)^+ are d-spheres. Since
disjoint unions are dual to Zykov joins, graph complements of 1-dimensional discrete manifolds
G are homotop to a point, a sphere or a wedge sums of spheres. If the length of every connected component
of a 1-manifold is not divisible by 3, the graph complement of G is a sphere. In general, the graph complement
of a forest is either contractible or a sphere. All induced strict subgraphs of G(n) are either contractible
or homotop to spheres. The f-vectors G(n) or G(n)^+ satisfy a hyper Pascal triangle relation, the
total number of simplices are hyper Fibonacci numbers. The simplex generating functions are Jacobsthal
polynomials, generating functions of k-king configurations on a circular chess board. While the
Euler curvature of circle complements G(n) is constant by symmetry, the discrete Gauss-Bonnet
curvature of path complements G(n)^+ can be expressed explicitly from the generating functions.
There is now a non-trivial 6 periodic Gauss-Bonnet curvature universality in the complement of
Barycentric limits. The Brouwer-Lefschetz fixed point theorem produces a 12-periodicity of the
Lefschetz numbers of all graph automorphisms of G(n). There is also a 12-periodicity of Wu characteristic.
This is a 4 periodicity in dimension.These are manifestations of stable homotopy features, but
combinatorial.

An alternative or supplementary approach named as physical layer security has been proposed to
afford an extra security layer on top of the conventional cryptography technique. In this paper,
an overview of secrecy performance investigations over the classic Alice-Bob-Eve wiretap fading
channels is conducted. On the basis of the classic wiretap channel model, we have comprehensively
listed and thereafter compared the existing works on physical layer secrecy analysis considering
the small-scale, large-scale, composite, and cascaded fading channel models. Exact secrecy metrics
expressions, including secrecy outage probability (SOP), the probability of non-zero secrecy
capacity (PNZ), average secrecy capacity (ASC), and secrecy bounds, including the lower bound
of SOP and ergodic secrecy capacity, are presented. In order to encompass the aforementioned four
kinds of fading channel models with a more generic and flexible distribution, the mixture gamma
(MG), mixture of Gaussian (MoG), and Fox's $H$-function distributions are three useful candidates
to largely include the above-mentioned four kinds of fading channel models. It is shown that they
are flexible and general when assisting the secrecy analysis to obtain closed-form expressions.
Their advantages and limitations are also highlighted. Conclusively, these three approaches
are proven to provide a unified secrecy analysis framework and can cover all types of independent
wiretap fading channel models. Apart from those, revisiting the existing secrecy enhancement
techniques based on our system configuration, the on-off transmission scheme, jamming approach
(including artificial noise (AN) & artificial fast fading (AFF)), antenna selection, and security
region are presented.

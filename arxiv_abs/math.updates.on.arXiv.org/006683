In the recent years, the notion of rank metric in the context of coding theory has known many interesting
developments in terms of applications such as space time coding, network coding or public key cryptography.
These applications raised the interest of the community for theoretical properties of this type
of codes, such as the hardness of decoding in rank metric. Among classical problems associated to
codes for a given metric, the notion of code equivalence (to decide if two codes are isometric) has
always been of the greatest interest, for its cryptographic applications or its deep connexions
to the graph isomorphism problem. In this article, we discuss the hardness of the code equivalence
problem in rank metric for $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$-linear and general rank metric codes. In the $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$-linear
case, we reduce the underlying problem to another one called {\em Matrix Codes Right Equivalence
Problem}. We prove the latter problem to be either in $\mathcal{P}$ or in $\mathcal{ZPP}$ depending
of the ground field size. This is obtained by designing an algorithm whose principal routines are
linear algebra and factoring polynomials over finite fields. It turns out that the most difficult
instances involve codes with non trivial {\em stabilizer algebras}. The resolution of the latter
case will involve tools related to finite dimensional algebras and Wedderburn--Artin theory.
It is interesting to note that 30 years ago, an important trend in theoretical computer science consisted
to design algorithms making effective major results of this theory. These algorithmic results
turn out to be particularly useful in the present article. Finally, for general matrix codes, we
prove that the equivalence problem (both left and right) is at least as hard as the well--studied
{\em Monomial Equivalence Problem} for codes endowed with the Hamming metric.

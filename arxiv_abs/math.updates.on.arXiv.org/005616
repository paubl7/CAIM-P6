The accumulation of potassium in the narrow space outside nerve cells is a classical subject of biophysics
that has received much attention recently. It may be involved in potassium accumulation include
spreading depression, perhaps migraine and some kinds of epilepsy, even (speculatively) learning.
Quantitative analysis is likely to help evaluate the role of potassium clearance from the extracellular
space after a train of action potentials. Clearance involves three structures that extend down
the length of the nerve: glia, extracellular space, and axon and so need to be described in the tradition
of the 'cable equations' of nerve used to explain nerve conduction since the work of Hodgkin in 1937.
A three-compartment model is proposed here for the optic nerve and is used to study the accumulation
of potassium and its clearance. The model allows the convection, diffusion, and electrical migration
of water and ions. We depend on the data of Orkand et al to ensure the relevance of our model and align
its parameters with the anatomy and properties of membranes, channels, and transporters: our model
fits their experimental data quite well. The aligned model shows that glia has an important role
in buffering potassium, as expected. The model shows that potassium is cleared mostly by convective
flow through the syncytia of glia driven by osmotic pressure differences. A simplified model might
be possible, but it must involve flow down the length of the optic nerve. It is easy for compartment
models to neglect this flow. Our model can be used for structures quite different from the optic nerve
that might have different distributions of channels and transporters in its three compartments.
It can be generalized to include the fourth compartment to deal with the glymphatic flow into the
circulatory system.

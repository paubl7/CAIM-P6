The unified transform method (UTM) provides a novel approach to the analysis of initial-boundary
value problems for linear as well as for a particular class of nonlinear partial differential equations
called integrable. If the latter equations are formulated in two dimensions (either one space and
one time, or two space dimensions), the UTM expresses the solution in terms of a matrix Riemann-Hilbert
(RH) problem with explicit dependence on the independent variables. For nonlinear integrable
evolution equations, such as the celebrated nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) equation, the associated
jump matrices are computed in terms of the initial conditions and all boundary values. The unknown
boundary values are characterized in terms of the initial datum and the given boundary conditions
via the analysis of the so-called global relation. In general, this analysis involves the solution
of certain nonlinear equations. In certain cases, called linearizable, it is possible to bypass
this nonlinear step. In these cases, the UTM solves the given initial-boundary value problem with
the same level of efficiency as the well-known inverse scattering transform solves the initial
value problem on the infinite line. We show here that the initial-boundary value problem on a finite
interval with $x$-periodic boundary conditions (which can alternatively be viewed as the initial
value problem on a circle), belongs to the linearizable class. Indeed, by employing certain transformations
of the associated RH problem and by using the global relation, the relevant jump matrices can be expressed
explicitly in terms of the so-called scattering data, which are computed in terms of the initial
datum. Details are given for NLS, but similar considerations are valid for other well-known integrable
evolution equations, including the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) and modified KdV equations.

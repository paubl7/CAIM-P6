In this master thesis, we extend results from classical simple homotopy theory to the world of stratified
homotopy theory. To obtain a well-established framework to work in, we prove a series of results
on two model categories of simplicial sets and topological spaces, both equipped with a notion of
filtration, introduced by Sylvain Douteau in his PHD thesis. In particular, we show that there is
a fully faithful embedding of homotopy categories from the (finite) filtered simplicial into the
filtered topological setting. We also use these results to characterize the morphisms in the topological
filtered homotopy category between filtered spaces that are triangulable and stratified in some
very general sense as stratified homotopy classes of stratum preserving maps. Then, moving on to
simple homotopy theory, we propose a class of combinatorial elementary expansions for filtered
simplicial sets that generalize both the classical ones as well as a class of stratified expansions
suggested by Banagl et al. We show that they fulfill a series of axioms, suggested by Eckmann and Siebenmann
for the construction of simple homotopy theory. In doing so, we obtain a combinatorially defined
Whitehead group and torsion for filtered simplicial sets (and hence also for triangulable stratified
spaces). We then begin a detailed investigation of their formal properties, proving for example
that a Mayer-Vietoris formula holds. Next, we apply our results on stratified homotopy theory to
obtain a more topological description of the Whitehead group and to generalize the Whitehead torsion
to arbitrary stratum preserving maps of triangulated filtered spaces. Finally, we prove that our
simple homotopy theory is a generalization of the classical one, in the sense that it agrees with
the latter when one considers trivially filtered simplicial sets as CW-complexes.

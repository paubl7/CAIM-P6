Riemann-Hilbert problems are jump problems for holomorphic functions along given interfaces.
They arise in various contexts, e.g. in the asymptotic study of certain nonlinear partial differential
equations and in the asymptotic analysis of orthogonal polynomials. Matrix-valued Riemann-Hilbert
problems were considered by Deift et al. in the 1990s with a noncommutative adaptation of the steepest
descent method. For orthogonal polynomials on the line or on the circle with respect to exponentially
varying weights, this led to a strong asymptotic expansion in the given parameters. For orthogonal
polynomials with respect to planar exponentially varying weights, the corresponding asymptotics
was obtained by Hedenmalm and Wennman (2017), using a technically involved construction of an invariant
foliation for the orthogonality. Planar orthogonal polynomials are characterized in terms of
a matrix dbar-problem (Its, Takhtajan), which we call a soft Riemann-Hilbert problem. Here, we
use this perspective to offer a simplified approach based not on foliations but instead on the ad
hoc insertion of an algebraic ansatz for the Cauchy potential in the soft Riemann-Hilbert problem.
This allows the problem to decompose into a hierarchy of scalar Riemann-Hilbert problems along
the interface, which appears as the free boundary for an obstacle problem. Inspired by microlocal
analysis, the method allows for control of the solution in such a way that for real-analytic weights,
the asymptotics holds in the $L^2$ sense with error $O(e^{-\delta\sqrt{m}})$ in a fixed neighborhood
of the closed exterior of the interface, for some constant $\delta>0$, where $m\to+\infty$. Here,
$m$ is the degree of the polynomial, and in terms of pointwise asymptotics, the expansion dominates
the error term in the exterior domain and across the interface a distance proportional to $m^{-\frac14}$.

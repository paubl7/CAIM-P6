The notion of conelike radiant structure formalizes the idea of a not necessarily flat affine connection
equipped with a family of surfaces that behave like the intersections of the planes through the origin
with a convex cone in a real vector space. A radiant structure means a torsion-free affine connection
and a radiant vector field, meaning its covariant derivative is the identity endomorphism. A radiant
structure is conelike if for every point and every two-dimensional subspace containing the radiant
vector field there is a totally geodesics surface passing through the point and tangent to the subspace.
Such structures exist on the total space of any principal bundle with one-dimensional fiber and
on any Lie group with a quadratic structure on its Lie algebra. The affine connection of a conelike
radiant structure can be normalized in a canonical way to have antisymmetric Ricci tensor. Applied
to a conelike radiant structure on the total space of a principal bundle with one-dimensional fiber
this yields a generalization of the classical Thomas connection of a projective structure. The
compatibility of radiant and conelike structure with metrics is investigated and yields a construction
of connections for which the symmetrized Ricci curvature is a constant multiple of a compatible
metric that generalizes well-known constructions of Riemannian and Lorentzian Einstein-Weyl
structures over K\"ahler-Einstein manifolds having nonzero scalar curvature. A formulation
of Einstein equations for statistical manifolds (and a conformal generalization of statistical
structures) is given that generalizes the Einstein-Weyl equations and encompasses these more
general examples. Finally, there are constructed left-invariant conelike radiant structures
on a Lie group with a left-invariant nondegenerate bilinear form, and the case of three-dimensional
unimodular Lie groups is described in detail.

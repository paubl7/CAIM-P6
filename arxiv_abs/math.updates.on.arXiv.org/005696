We introduce the twisted $\boldsymbol{\mu}_4$-normal form for elliptic curves, deriving in particular
addition algorithms with complexity $9\mathbf{M} + 2\mathbf{S}$ and doubling algorithms with
complexity $2\mathbf{M} + 5\mathbf{S} + 2\mathbf{m}$ over a binary field. Every ordinary elliptic
curve over a finite field of characteristic 2 is isomorphic to one in this family. This improvement
to the addition algorithm, applicable to a larger class of curves, is comparable to the $7\mathbf{M}
+ 2\mathbf{S}$ achieved for the $\boldsymbol{\mu}_4$-normal form, and replaces the previously
best known complexity of $13\mathbf{M} + 3\mathbf{S}$ on L\'opez-Dahab models applicable to these
twisted curves. The derived doubling algorithm is essentially optimal, without any assumption
of special cases. We show moreover that the Montgomery scalar multiplication with point recovery
carries over to the twisted models, giving symmetric scalar multiplication adapted to protect
against side channel attacks, with a cost of $4\mathbf{M} + 4\mathbf{S} + 1\mathbf{m}_t + 2\mathbf{m}_c$
per bit. In characteristic different from 2, we establish a linear isomorphism with the twisted
Edwards model over the base field. This work, in complement to the introduction of $\boldsymbol{\mu}_4$-normal
form, fills the lacuna in the body of work on efficient arithmetic on elliptic curves over binary
fields, explained by this common framework for elliptic curves in $\boldsymbol{\mu}_4$-normal
form over a field of any characteristic. The improvements are analogous to those which the Edwards
and twisted Edwards models achieved for elliptic curves over finite fields of odd characteristic,
and extend $\boldsymbol{\mu}_4$-normal form to cover the binary NIST curves.

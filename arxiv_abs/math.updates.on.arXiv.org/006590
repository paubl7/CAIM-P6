Growth occurs in a wide range of systems ranging from biological tissue to additive manufacturing.
This work considers surface growth, in which mass is added to the boundary of a continuum body from
the ambient medium or from within the body. In contrast to bulk growth in the interior, the description
of surface growth requires the addition of new continuum particles to the body. This is challenging
for standard continuum formulations for solids that are meant for situations with a fixed amount
of material. Recent approaches to handle this have used time-evolving reference configurations.
In this work, an Eulerian approach to this problem is formulated, enabling the side-stepping of
the issue of constructing the reference configuration. However, this raises the complementary
challenge of determining the stress response of the solid, which typically requires the deformation
gradient that is not immediately available in the Eulerian formulation. To resolve this, the approach
introduces additional kinematic descriptors, namely the relaxed zero-stress deformation and
the elastic deformation; in contrast to the deformation gradient, these have the important advantage
that they are not required to satisfy kinematic compatibility. The resulting model has only the
density, velocity, and elastic deformation as variables in the Eulerian setting. The introduction
in this formulation of the relaxed deformation and the elastic deformation provides a description
of surface growth whereby the added material can bring in its own kinematic information. Loosely,
the added material "brings in its own reference configuration" through the specification of the
relaxed deformation and the elastic deformation of the added material. This kinematic description
enables, e.g., modeling of non-normal growth using a standard normal growth velocity and a simple
approach to prescribing boundary conditions.

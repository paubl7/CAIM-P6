Physics considerations suggest that a theory of Liouville quantum gravity (LQG) should exist for
all values of matter central charge $\mathbf{c} \in (-\infty,25)$. Probabilists have rigorously
defined LQG as a random metric measure space for $\mathbf{c} < 1$; however, they have only very recently
begun to explore LQG in the $\mathbf{c} \in (1,25)$ phase. We define a random metric associated to
LQG for all $\mathbf{c} < 25$ by a collection of axioms analogous to axioms stated in the $\mathbf{c}
< 1$ setting. We show that such a metric exists for each $\mathbf{c}$ by considering an approximating
metric known as Liouville first passage percolation. Ding and Gwynne proved that these approximating
metrics are tight in a suitably chosen topology; we show that every subsequential limit satisfies
our axioms. In particular, our result defines a metric associated to LQG in the critical case $\mathbf{c}
=1$. The metrics we define for $\mathbf{c} \in (1,25)$ exhibit geometric behavior that sharply
contrasts with the $\mathbf{c} < 1$ regime. We show that, for $\mathbf{c} \in (1,25)$, the metrics
do not induce the Euclidean topology since they a.s. have a dense (measure zero) set of singular points,
points at infinite distance from all other points. We use this fact to prove that a.s. the metric ball
is not compact and its boundary has infinite Hausdorff dimension. Despite these differences, we
demonstrate that many properties of LQG metrics for $\mathbf{c} < 1$ extend in some form to the entire
range $(-\infty, 25)$. We show that the metrics are a.s. reverse H\"older continuous with respect
to the Euclidean metric, are a.s. complete and geodesic away from the set of singular points, and
satisfy the bounds for set-to-set distances that hold in the $\mathbf{c} < 1$ phase. Finally, we
prove that the metrics satisfy a version of the (geometric) Knizhnik-Polyakov-Zamolodchikov
(KPZ) formula.

Many city residents cannot install their private electric vehicle (EV) charging stations due to
lack of dedicated parking spaces or insufficient grid capacity. This presents a significant barrier
towards large-scale EV adoption. To address this concern, this paper considers a novel business
model, on-demand valet charging, that unlocks the potential of under-utilized public charging
infrastructure to promise higher EV penetration. In the proposed model, a platform recruits a fleet
of couriers that shuttle between customers and public charging stations to provide on-demand valet
charging services to EV owners at an affordable price. Couriers are dispatched to pick up out-of-battery
EVs from the customer residence, deliver the EVs to the charging station, plug them in, and then return
the fully-charged EVs to customers. To depict the proposed business model, we develop a queuing
network to represent the stochastic matching dynamics, and further formulate an economic equilibrium
model to capture the incentives of couriers, customers as well as the platform. These models are
used to examine how charging infrastructure planning and government regulation affect the market
outcome. First, we find that the optimal charging station densities for distinct stakeholders
are different: couriers prefer a lower density; the platform prefers a higher density; while the
density in-between leads to the highest EV penetration as it balances the time traveling to and queuing
at charging stations. Second, we evaluate a regulatory policy that imposes a tax on the platform
and invests the tax revenue in public charging infrastructure. Numerical results suggest that
this regulation can suppress the platform's market power associated with monopoly pricing, increase
social welfare, and facilitate market expansion.

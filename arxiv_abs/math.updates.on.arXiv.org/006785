Chari and Greenstein [Adv. Math. 2009] introduced combinatorial subsets of the roots of a finite-dimensional
simple Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ which were important in studying Kirillov-Reshetikhin modules
over $U_q(\widehat{\mathfrak{g}})$ and their specializations. Later, Khare [J. Algebra. 2016]
studied these subsets for many highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules (in finite type), under
the name of weak-$\mathbb{A}$-faces (for a subgroup $\mathbb{A}$ of $(\mathbb{R},+)$), and more
generally, $(\{2\};\{1,2\})$-closed subsets. These notions extend and unify the faces of Weyl
polytopes as well as the above combinatorial subsets. In this paper, we consider these 'discrete'
notions for all Kac-Moody algebras $\mathfrak{g}$, in four distinguished settings: (a) the weights
of an arbitrary highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-module $V$; (b) the convex hull of the weights of
$V$; (c) the weights of the adjoint representation; (d) the roots of $\mathfrak{g}$. For (a) (resp.,
(b)) for all highest weight $\mathfrak{g}$-modules $V$, we show that the weak-$\mathbb{A}$-faces
and $(\{2\};\{1,2\})$-closed subsets agree, and equal the sets of weights on exposed faces (resp.,
equal the exposed faces) of the convex hull of weights conv$_{\mathbb{R}}$ wt $V$. This completes
the partial progress of Khare in finite type, and is novel in infinite type. Our proofs are type-free
and self-contained. For (c), (d) involving the root system, we similarly achieve complete classifications.
For all Kac-Moody $\mathfrak{g}$ - interestingly, other than $\mathfrak{sl}_3, \widehat{\mathfrak{sl}_3}$
- we show the weak-$\mathbb{A}$-faces and $(\{2\};\{1,2\})$-closed subsets agree, and equal
Weyl group translates of the sets of weights in certain 'standard faces' (which also holds for highest
weight modules). This was proved by Chari and her coauthors for root systems in finite type, but is
novel for other types.

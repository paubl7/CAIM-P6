The Akhmediev breather (AB) and its M-soliton generalization $AB_M$ are exact solutions of the
focusing NLS equation periodic in space and exponentially localized in time over the constant unstable
background; they describe the appearance of $M$ unstable nonlinear modes and their interaction,
and they are expected to play a relevant role in the theory of periodic anomalous (rogue) waves (AWs)
in nature. It is rather well established that they are unstable with respect to small perturbations
of the NLS equation. Concerning perturbations of these solutions within the NLS dynamics, there
is the following common believe in the literature. Let the NLS background be unstable with respect
to the first $N$ modes; then i) if the $M$ unstable modes of the $AB_M$ solution are strictly contained
in this set ($M<N$), then the $AB_M$ is unstable; ii) if $M=N$, the so-called ``saturation of the
instability'', then the $AB_M$ solution is neutrally stable. We argue instead that the $AB_M$ solution
is always unstable, even in the saturation case $M=N$, and we prove it in the simplest case $M=N=1$.
We first prove the linear instability, constructing two examples of $x$-periodic solutions of
the linearized theory growing exponentially in time. Then we investigate the nonlinear instability
using our previous results showing that i) a perturbed AB initial condition evolves into an exact
Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) recurrence of ABs described in terms of elementary functions
of the initial data, to leading order; ii) the AB solution is more unstable than the background solution,
and its instability increases as $T\to 0$, where $T$ is the AB appearance parameter. Although the
AB solution is linearly and nonlinearly unstable, it is relevant in nature, since its instability
generates a FPUT recurrence of ABs. These results suitably generalize to the case $M=N>1$.

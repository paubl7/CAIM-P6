The full-waveform inversion (FWI) addresses the computation and characterization of subsurface
model parameters by matching predicted data to observed seismograms in the frame of nonlinear optimization.
We formulate FWI as a nonlinearly constrained optimization problem, for which a regularization
term is minimized subject to the nonlinear data matching constraint. Unlike FWI which is based on
the penalty function, the method of multipliers solves the resulting optimization problems by
using the augmented Lagrangian function; and leads to a two-step recursive algorithm. The primal
step requires solving an unconstrained minimization problem like the traditional FWI with a difference
that the data are replaced by the Lagrange multipliers. The dual step involves an update of the Lagrange
multipliers. The overall performance of the algorithm is improved considering that this multiplier
method does not require an exact solution of these primal-dual subproblems. In fact, convergence
is attained when only one step of a gradient-based method is taken on both subproblems. The proposed
algorithm greatly improves the overall performance of FWI such as convergence from inaccurate
starting models and robustness with respect to the determination of the step length. Furthermore,
it can be performed by the existing FWI engines with minimal change. We only have to replace the observed
data at each iteration with the multipliers, thus all the nice properties of the traditional FWI
algorithms are kept. Numerical experiments confirm that the multipliers waveform inversion can
converge to a solution of the inverse problem in the absence of low-frequency data from an inaccurate
initial model even with a constant step size.

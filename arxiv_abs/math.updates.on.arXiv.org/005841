This article is the second of two in which we develop a geometric framework for analysing silent and
anisotropic big bang singularities. In the present article, we record geometric conclusions obtained
by combining the geometric framework with Einstein's equations. The main features of the results
are the following: The assumptions do not involve any symmetry requirements and are weak enough
to be consistent with most big bang singularities for which the asymptotic geometry is understood.
The framework gives a clear picture of the asymptotic geometry. It also reproduces the Kasner map,
conjectured in the physics literature to constitute the essence of the asymptotic dynamics for
vacuum solutions to Einstein's equations. When combined with Einstein's equations, the framework
yields partial improvements of the assumptions concerning, e.g., the expansion normalised Weingarten
map $\mathcal{K}$ (one of the central objects of the framework, defined as the Weingarten map of
the leaves of the foliation divided by the mean curvature). For example, the expansion normalised
normal derivative of $\mathcal{K}$ can, under suitable assumptions concerning the eigenvalues
of $\mathcal{K}$, be demonstrated to decay exponentially and $\mathcal{K}$ can be demonstrated
to converge exponentially, even though we initially only impose weighted bounds on these quantities.
Finally, the framework gives a unified perspective on the existing results. Moreover, in $3+1$-dimensions,
the only parameters necessary to interpret the results are the eigenvalues of $\mathcal{K}$ and
an additional scalar function determined by the geometry induced on the leaves of the foliation.
In the companion article, we obtain conclusions concerning the asymptotic behaviour of solutions
to linear systems of wave equations on the backgrounds consistent with the framework.

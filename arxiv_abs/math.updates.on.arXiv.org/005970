The need to recover high-dimensional signals from their noisy low-resolution quantized measurements
is widely encountered in communications and sensing. In this paper, we focus on the extreme case
of one-bit quantizers, and propose a deep detector entitled LoRD-Net for recovering information
symbols from one-bit measurements. Our method is a model-aware data-driven architecture based
on deep unfolding of first-order optimization iterations. LoRD-Net has a task-based architecture
dedicated to recovering the underlying signal of interest from the one-bit noisy measurements
without requiring prior knowledge of the channel matrix through which the one-bit measurements
are obtained. The proposed deep detector has much fewer parameters compared to black-box deep networks
due to the incorporation of domain-knowledge in the design of its architecture, allowing it to operate
in a data-driven fashion while benefiting from the flexibility, versatility, and reliability
of model-based optimization methods. LoRD-Net operates in a blind fashion, which requires addressing
both the non-linear nature of the data-acquisition system as well as identifying a proper optimization
objective for signal recovery. Accordingly, we propose a two-stage training method for LoRD-Net,
in which the first stage is dedicated to identifying the proper form of the optimization process
to unfold, while the latter trains the resulting model in an end-to-end manner. We numerically evaluate
the proposed receiver architecture for one-bit signal recovery in wireless communications and
demonstrate that the proposed hybrid methodology outperforms both data-driven and model-based
state-of-the-art methods, while utilizing small datasets, on the order of merely $\sim 500$ samples,
for training.

The purpose of this paper is to study the phenomenon of singularity formation in large data problems
for classical solutions to the Cauchy problem of the relativistic Euler equations. The classical
theory established by P. D. Lax in 1964 (J. Math. Phys. 5: 611-614) shows that, for 2x2 hyperbolic
systems, the break-down of classical solutions occurs in finite time if initial data contain any
compression in some truly nonlinear characteristic field under some additional conditions, which
include genuine nonlinearity and the strict positivity of the difference between two corresponding
eigenvalues. These harsh structural assumptions mean that it is highly non-trivial to apply this
theory to archetypal systems of conservation laws, such as the (1+1)-dimensional relativistic
Euler equations. Actually, in the (1+1)-dimensional spacetime setting, if the mass-energy density
does not vanish initially at any finite point, the essential difficulty in considering the possible
break-down is to obtain sharp enough control on the lower bound of the mass-energy density. To this
end, based on introducing several key artificial quantities and some elaborate analysis on the
difference of the two Riemann invariants, we characterized the decay of mass-energy density lower
bound in time. On the one hand, for the classical solutions with large data and possible far field
vacuum to the isentropic flow, we verified the theory obtained by P. D. Lax in 1964. On the other hand,
for the classical solutions with large data and strictly positive initial mass-energy density
to the non-isentropic flow, we exhibit a numerical value N, thought of as representing the strength
of an initial compression, above which all initial data lead to a finite-time singularity formation.
These singularities manifest as a blow-up in the gradient of certain Riemann invariants associated
with corresponding systems.

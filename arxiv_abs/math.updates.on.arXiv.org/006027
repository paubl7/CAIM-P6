A complex unit gain graph ($\mathbb{T}$-gain graph), $\Phi = (G, \varphi)$ is a graph where the function
$\varphi$ assigns a unit complex number to each orientation of an edge of $G$, and its inverse is assigned
to the opposite orientation. A $ \mathbb{T} $-gain graph $\Phi$ is balanced if the product of the
edge gains of each cycle (with a fixed orientation) is $1$. Signed graphs are special cases of $\mathbb{T}$-gain
graphs. The adjacency matrix of $\Phi$, denoted by $ \mathbf{A}(\Phi)$ is defined canonically.
The gain Laplacian for $\Phi$ is defined as $\mathbf{L}(\Phi) = \mathbf{D}(\Phi) - \mathbf{A}(\Phi)$,
where $\mathbf{D}(\Phi)$ is the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries are the degrees of the vertices
of $G$. The minimum number of vertices (resp., edges) to be deleted from $\Phi$ in order to get a balanced
gain graph the frustration number (resp, frustration index). We show that frustration number and
frustration index are bounded below by the smallest eigenvalue of $\mathbf{L}(\Phi)$. We provide
several lower and upper bounds for extremal eigenvalues of $\mathbf{L}(\Phi)$ in terms of different
graph parameters such as the number of edges, vertex degrees, and average $2$-degrees. The signed
graphs are particular cases of the $\mathbb{T}$-gain graphs, all the bounds established in paper
hold for signed graphs. Most of the bounds established here are new for signed graphs. Finally, we
perform comparative analysis for all the obtained bounds in the paper with the state-of-the-art
bounds available in the literature for randomly generated Erd\H{o}s-Re\'yni graphs. Some of the
major highlights of our paper are the gain-dependent bounds, limit convergence of the bounds to
the extremal eigenvalues, and optimal extremal bounds obtained by posing optimization problems
to achieve the best possible bounds.

Reducing a chain complex (whilst preserving its homotopy-type) using algebraic Morse theory gives
the same end-result as Gaussian elimination, but AMT does it only on certain rows/columns and with
several pivots (in all matrices simultaneously). Crucially, instead of doing costly row/column
operations on a sparse matrix, it computes traversals of a bipartite digraph. This significantly
reduces the running time and memory load (smaller fill-in and coefficient growth of the matrices).
However, computing with AMT requires the construction of a valid set of pivots (called a Morse matching).
We discover a family of Morse matchings on any chain complex of free modules of finite rank. We show
that every acyclic matching is a subset of some member of our family, so all maximal Morse matchings
are of this type. Both the input and output of AMT are chain complexes, so the procedure can be used
iteratively. When working over a field or a local PID, this process ends in a chain complex with zero
matrices, which produces homology. However, even over more general rings, the process often reveals
homology, or at least reduces the complex so much that other algorithms can finish the job. Moreover,
it also returns homotopy equivalences to the reduced complexes, which reveal the generators of
the homology and the induced maps $H_\ast(\varphi)$. We design a new algorithm for reducing a chain
complex and implement it. We test that it outperforms other CASs. As a special case, given a sparse
matrix over any field, the algorithm offers a new way of computing the rank and a sparse basis of the
kernel (or null space), cokernel (or quotient space, or complementary subspace), image, preimage,
sum and intersection subspace. It outperforms built-in algorithms in other CASs.

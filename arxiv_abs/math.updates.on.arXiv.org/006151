Elliptic curves arise in many areas of number theory. One way to study them is take local data, the
number of solutions modulo $p$, and create an $L$-function, which is related to two of the seven Clay
Millenial Problems: (Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture, Generalized Riemann Hypothesis).
We study 1-parameter families over $\mathbb{Q}(T)$, which are of the form $y^2=x^3+A(T)x+B(T)$,
with non-constant $j$-invariant. We define the $r$\textsuperscript{th} moment of an elliptic
curve to be $A_{r,E}(p):=\frac1{p}\sum_{t\bmod p}a_t(p)^r$, where $a_t(p)$ is $p$ minus the
number of solutions to $y^2=x^3+A(t)x+B(t)\bmod p$. Rosen and Silverman showed biases in the first
moment equal the rank of the Mordell-Weil group of rational solutions. Michel proved that $pA_{2,E}(p)=p^2+O(p^{3/2})$.
Based on several special families where computations can be done in closed form, Miller conjectured
that the largest lower-order term in the second moment that doesn't average to $0$ is on average negative.
He further showed that such a negative bias has implications in the distribution of zeros of the elliptic
curve $L$-function near the central point. Evidence for this conjecture is limited to special families.
Ee explore the first and second moments of some 1 and 2-parameter families, looking to see if the biases
persist and exploring the consequence these have. We observe that in all of the families where we
can compute in closed form that the first term that does not average to zero in the second-moment expansion
of the Dirichlet coefficients has a negative average. We also systematically investigate families
of various rank. These are the first general tests of the conjecture; while we cannot in general obtain
closed form solutions, we discuss computations which support or contradict the conjecture. We
then generalize to higher moments, and see evidence that the bias continues in the even moments.

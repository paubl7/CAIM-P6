The local Langlands correspondence matches irreducible representations of a reductive p-adic
group G(F) with enhanced L-parameters. It is conjectured by Hellmann and Zhu that it can be categorified.
Then it should become a fully faithful functor from a derived category of representations to a derived
category of equivariant sheaves on some variety of L-parameters. We approach this conjecture in
the case of finite length G(F)-representations. Then it runs via graded Hecke algebras associated
to Bernstein components or to enhanced L-parameters. Here we work with graded Hecke algebras H on
the Galois side, those can be constructed entirely in terms of a complex reductive group, endowed
with data from L-parameters. We fix an arbitrary central character (\sigma,r) of H (which encodes
the image of Frobenius by an L-parameter). That leads to a variety g_N^{\sigma,r} of nilpotent elements
in the Lie algebra of G (possibilities for the monodromy operator from an L-parameter) and to a complex
of equivariant constructible sheaves K_{N,\sigma,r} on g_N^{\sigma,r}. We relate the (derived)
endomorphism algebra of (g_N^{\sigma,r}, K_{N,\sigma,r}) to a localization of H, which yields
an equivalence between the appropriate categories of finite length modules of these algebras.
From there we construct a fully faithful functor between: - the bounded derived category of finite
length H-modules specified by the central character (\sigma,r), - the equivariant bounded derived
category of constructible sheaves on g_N^{\sigma,r}. Also, we explicitly determine the images
of standard modules under this functor. We expect that these results pave the way for more general
instances of the aforementioned conjectural extension of the local Langlands correspondence.

We present a model-free data-driven inference method that enables inferences on system outcomes
to be derived directly from empirical data without the need for intervening modeling of any type,
be it modeling of a material law or modeling of a prior distribution of material states. We specifically
consider physical systems with states characterized by points in a phase space determined by the
governing field equations. We assume that the system is characterized by two likelihood measures:
one $\mu_D$ measuring the likelihood of observing a material state in phase space; and another $\mu_E$
measuring the likelihood of states satisfying the field equations, possibly under random actuation.
We introduce a notion of intersection between measures which can be interpreted to quantify the
likelihood of system outcomes. We provide conditions under which the intersection can be characterized
as the athermal limit $\mu_\infty$ of entropic regularizations $\mu_\beta$, or thermalizations,
of the product measure $\mu = \mu_D\times \mu_E$ as $\beta \to +\infty$. We also supply conditions
under which $\mu_\infty$ can be obtained as the athermal limit of carefully thermalized $(\mu_{h,\beta_h})$
sequences of empirical data sets $(\mu_h)$ approximating weakly an unknown likelihood function
$\mu$. In particular, we find that the cooling sequence $\beta_h \to +\infty$ must be slow enough,
corresponding to quenching, in order for the proper limit $\mu_\infty$ to be delivered. Finally,
we derive explicit analytic expressions for expectations $\mathbb{E}[f]$ of outcomes $f$ that
are explicit in the data, thus demonstrating the feasibility of the model-free data-driven paradigm
as regards making convergent inferences directly from the data without recourse to intermediate
modeling steps.

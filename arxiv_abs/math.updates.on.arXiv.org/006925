In the last paper \cite{R7}, it was studied Hilbert, Poincare and Neumann boundary-value problems
with arbitrary measurable data for generalized analytic functions and generalized harmonic functions
with applications to the relevant problems of mathematical physics. The present paper is devoted
to the study of the boundary-value problems with arbitrary measurable boundary data in domains
with rectifiable boundaries for the corresponding semi-linear equations with suitable nonlinear
sources. For this purpose, here it is constructed completely continuous operators generating
nonclassical solutions of the Hilbert and Poincare boundary-value problems with arbitrary measurable
data for the Vekua type equations and the Poisson equations, respectively. On this base, it is first
proved the existence of solutions of the Hilbert boundary-value problem with arbitrary measurable
data in any domains with rectifiable boundaries for the nonlinear equations of the Vekua type. It
is necessary to note that our approach is based on the geometric interpretation of boundary values
as angular (along nontangential path) limits in comparison with the classical variational approach
in PDE. The latter makes it is also possible to obtain the theorem on the existence of nonclassical
solutions of the Poincare boundary-value problem on the directional derivatives and, in particular,
of the Neumann problem with arbitrary measurable data to the Poisson equations with nonlinear sources
in Jordan domains with rectifiable boundaries. As consequences, then it is given a series of applications
of this theorem to some problems of mathematical physics describing, for instance, such phenomena
as physical and chemical absorption with diffusion, plasma states, stationary burning etc.

In this paper, we study two shape optimization problems from thermal insulation background, both
involve varying domains and the associated state functions. In the first problem, assuming that
the heat source is radial, by computing second shape derivatives and referring to Stekl\"off eigenvalue
problem, we obtain necessary and sufficient conditions such that ball shapes are stable shapes
among smooth volume preserving perturbations. In the second problem, we prove that for any ball
$B_R$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$, symmetry breaking of insulation material occurs exactly when $m\mu_2(B_R)<\frac{1}{2}\frac{P^2(B_R)}{|B_R|}(=2\pi,\,
\mbox{when}\,n=2)$, where $m$ is the total amount of material $m$, and $\mu_2$ is the first nonzero
eigenvalue of Neumann Laplacian. Based on this, we then obtain local minimality of ball shape when
$n=2$ and $m$ is bigger than the symmetry breaking threshold. Also, in the first problem, by relating
to Serrin's overdetermined symmetry result, we prove that concentration breaking phenomenon
occurs for any nonradial domains. In the second problem, we show that for any domain $\Omega$, there
is $m_2>0$ such that when $m<m_2$, the optimal distribution of insulation must vanish on some portion
of boundary. This number $m_2$ is related to $\kappa_1(\Omega)$, the first eigenvalue of boundary
mean zero Laplacian. Motivated by this and a possible new isoperimetric inequality from symmetry
breaking phenomenon, we then study spectral properties of boundary mean zero Laplacian, which
turns out to be closely related to the Neumann Laplacian eigenvalue problem when the domain is symmetric.
Among many other results, we prove that $\kappa_1(\Omega) \le \mu_2(\Omega)$, and necessary and
sufficient conditions for the equality holds are obtained. Explicit values of $\kappa_2$ on some
special domains are also given. Open questions will also be posted.

In this manuscript we consider the dual risk model with financial application, where the random
gains occur under a renewal process. We particularly work the Erlang(n) case for common distribution
of the inter-arrival times, from there it is easy to understand that our method or procedures can
be generalised to other cases under the matrix-exponential family case. We work several and different
problems involving future dividends and ruin. We also show that our results are valid even if the
usual income condition is not satisfied. In most known works under the dual model, the main target
under study have been the calculation of expected discounted future dividends and optimal strategies,
where the dividend calculation have been done on aggregate. We can find works, at first using the
classical compound Poisson model, then some examples of other renewal Erlang models. Knowing that
ruin is ultimately achieved, we find important that dividends should be evaluated on an individual
basis, where the early dividend contribution for the aggregate are of utmost importance. From our
calculations we can really see how much important is the contribution of the first dividend. Afonso
et al. (2013) had worked similar problems for the classical compound Poisson dual model. Besides
that we find explicit formulae for both the probability of getting a dividend and the distribution
of the amount of a single dividend. We still work the probability distribution of the number of gains
to reach a given upper target (like a constant dividend barrier) as well as for the number of gains
down to ruin. We complete the study working some illustrative numerical examples that show final
numbers for the several problems under study.

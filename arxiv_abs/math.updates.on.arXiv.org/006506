In this paper, by developing appropriate methods, we for the first time obtain characterization
of four fundamental notions of detectability for general labeled weighted automata over monoids
(denoted by $\mathcal{A}^{\mathfrak{M}}$ for short), where the four notions are strong (periodic)
detectability (SD and SPD) and weak (periodic) detectability (WD and WPD). Firstly, we formulate
the notions of concurrent composition, observer, and detector for $\mathcal{A}^{\mathfrak{M}}$.
Secondly, we use the concurrent composition to give an equivalent condition for SD, use the detector
to give an equivalent condition for SPD, and use the observer to give equivalent conditions for WD
and WPD, all for general $\mathcal{A}^{\mathfrak{M}}$ without any assumption. Thirdly, we prove
that for a labeled weighted automaton over monoid $(\mathbb{Q}^k,+)$ (denoted by $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Q}^k}$),
its concurrent composition, observer, and detector can be computed in NP, $2$-EXPTIME, and $2$-EXPTIME,
respectively, by developing novel connections between $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Q}^k}$ and the
NP-complete exact path length problem (proved by [Nyk\"{a}nen and Ukkonen, 2002]) and a subclass
of Presburger arithmetic. As a result, we prove that for $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Q}^k}$, SD can
be verified in coNP, while SPD, WD, and WPD can be verified in $2$-EXPTIME. Particularly, for $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{Q}^k}$
in which from every state, a distinct state can be reached through some unobservable, instantaneous
path, its detector can be computed in NP, and SPD can be verified in coNP. Finally, we prove that the
problems of verifying SD and SPD of deterministic $\mathcal{A}^{\mathbb{N}}$ over monoid $(\mathbb{N},+)$
are both NP-hard. The original methods developed in this paper will provide foundations for characterizing
other fundamental properties (e.g., diagnosability and opacity) in $\mathcal{A}^{\mathfrak{M}}$.

Bifurcation analysis has many applications in different scientific fields, such as electronics,
biology, ecology, and economics. In population biology, deterministic methods of bifurcation
are commonly used. In contrast, stochastic bifurcation techniques are infrequently employed.
Here we establish stochastic P-bifurcation behavior of (i) a growth model with state-dependent
birth rate and constant death rate, and (ii) a logistic growth model with state-dependent carrying
capacity, both of which are driven by multiplicative non-Gaussian noise. Transcritical bifurcation
occurs in the deterministic counterpart of the first model, while saddle-node bifurcation takes
place in the logistic growth model. We focus on the impact of the deterministic parameters, the stability
index, and the noise intensity on the stationary probability density functions (pdf) of the associated
non-local Fokker-Planck equation. Implications of these bifurcations in population dynamics
are discussed. In the first model, the bifurcation parameter is the ratio of the population birth
rate to the population death rate. In the second model, the bifurcation parameter corresponds to
the sensitivity of carrying capacity to change in the size of the population near equilibrium. In
each case, we show that as the value of the bifurcation parameter increases, the shape of the steady-state
pdf changes and that both stochastic models exhibit stochastic P-bifurcation. The unimodal pdf
becomes more peaked around deterministic equilibrium points as the stability index increases.
While an increase in any one of the other parameters has an effect on the stationary pdf. The peak appears
in the middle of the domain, which means a transition occurs

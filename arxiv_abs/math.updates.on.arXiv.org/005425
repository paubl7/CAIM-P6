A biological system is considered homeostatic when there is a regulated variable that is maintained
within a narrow range of values. A closely related notion of adaptation can be defined as a process
where a system initially responds to a stimulus, but then returns to basal or near-basal levels of
activity after some period of time. Adaptation of the chemotaxis sensory pathway of the bacterium
Escherichia coli is essential for detecting chemicals over a wide range of background concentrations,
ultimately allowing cells to swim towards sources of attractant and away from repellents. Since
bacterial chemotaxis is a paradigm for adaptation or homeostasis, we use it as a model system to base
the development of a general theory for the analysis of homeostasis in coupled dynamical systems
associated with input-output networks with multiple input nodes. This theory allows one to define
and classify homeostasis types of a given network in a model independent fashion, in the sense that
it depends only on the network topology and not on the specific model equations. Each homeostasis
type represents a possible mechanism for generating homeostasis and is associated with a suitable
subnetwork motif. Within this framework it is also possible to formalize a notion of generic property
of a coupled dynamical system, generalizing the notion of robustness. Finally, we apply our theory
to a model of Escherichia coli chemotaxis and show that, from this abstract point of view, adaptation
or homeostasis in this model is caused by a mechanism that we called input counterweight. This new
homeostasis mechanism is generated by a balancing between the several input nodes of the network
and requires the existence of at least two input nodes.

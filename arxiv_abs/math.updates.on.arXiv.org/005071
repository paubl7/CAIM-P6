Evaluating structural uncertainties associated with seismic imaging and target horizons can
be of critical importance for decision-making related to oil and gas exploration and production.
An important breakthrough for industrial applications has been made with the development of industrial
approaches to velocity model building. We propose here an extension of these approaches, using
non-linear slope tomography (rather than standard tomographic migration velocity analysis as
in previous publications). In addition to the advantages in terms of accuracy and efficiency of
the velocity model building (compared to standard tomography) it can be used to assess the quality
of standard uncertainty-related assumptions (linearity and Gaussian hypothesis within the Bayesian
theory) and estimate volumetric migration positioning uncertainties (a generalization of horizon
uncertainties). We derive and discuss the theoretical concepts underlying this approach and compare
our derivations with those of previous publications. A main advantage is that we work directly in
the full model space rather than in a preconditioned model space, (1) avoiding biased uncertainty
analysis and (2) splitting the analysis into the resolved and unresolved tomography spaces. Another
advantage is that, within the Bayesian formalism, we sample an equi-probable contour of the tomography
posterior probability density function (pdf) rather than the full pdf, stabilizing the estimation
of error bars. These advantages provide robustness to the approach. These concepts are illustrated
on two different 3D field datasets. The first one illustrates structural uncertainties on a merge
of different seismic surveys in the North Sea. The second one shows the impact of structural uncertainties
on gross-rock volume computation.

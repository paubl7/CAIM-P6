Finding meaningful ways to determine the dependency between two random variables $\xi$ and $\zeta$
is a timeless statistical endeavor with vast practical relevance. In recent years, several concepts
that aim to extend classical means (such as the Pearson correlation or rank-based coefficients
like Spearman's $\rho$) to more general spaces have been introduced and popularized, a well-known
example being the distance correlation. In this article, we propose and study an alternative framework
for measuring statistical dependency, the transport dependency $\tau \ge 0$, which relies on the
notion of optimal transport and is applicable in general Polish spaces. It can be estimated consistently
via the corresponding empirical measure, is versatile and adaptable to various scenarios by proper
choices of the cost function. Notably, statistical independence is characterized by $\tau = 0$,
while large values of $\tau$ indicate highly regular relations between $\xi$ and $\zeta$. Indeed,
for suitable base costs, $\tau$ is maximized if and only if $\zeta$ can be expressed as 1-Lipschitz
function of $\xi$ or vice versa. Based on sharp upper bounds, we exploit this characterization and
define three distinct dependency coefficients (a-c) with values in $[0, 1]$, each of which emphasizes
different functional relations. These transport correlations attain the value $1$ if and only
if $\zeta = \varphi(\xi)$, where $\varphi$ is a) a Lipschitz function, b) a measurable function,
c) a multiple of an isometry. The properties of coefficient c) make it comparable to the distance
correlation, while coefficient b) is a limit case of a) that was recently studied independently
by Wiesel (2021). Numerical results suggest that the transport dependency is a robust quantity
that efficiently discerns structure from noise in simple settings, often out-performing other
commonly applied coefficients of dependency.

Let f(1)=2, f(2)=4, f(n+1)=f(n)!. Edmund Landau's conjecture: the set P of primes of the form n^2+1
is infinite. It implies the unproven statement \Phi: card(P)<\omega => P \subseteq [2,f(7)]. Let
B={x_i!=x_k: i,k \in {1,...,9}} \cup {x_i \cdot x_j=x_k: i,j,k \in {1,...,9}}. We define a system
U \subseteq B of 9 equations which has exactly two solutions in positive integers: (1,...,1) and
(f(1),...,f(9)). Let \Psi denote the statement: if a system S \subseteq B has at most finitely many
solutions in positive integers x_1,...,x_9, then each such solution (x_1,...,x_9) satisfies
x_1,...,x_9 \leq f(9). We define a system A \subseteq B of 8 equations. Theorem 1. \Psi restricted
to the system A is equivalent to \Phi. Open Problem. Is there a set X \subseteq N that satisfies conditions
(1)-(5)? ***(1) There are many elements of X and it is conjectured that X is infinite. (2) No known
algorithm decides the finiteness/infiniteness of X. (3) There is a known algorithm that for every
k \in N decides whether or not k \in X. (4) There is a known algorithm that computes an integer n satisfying
card(X)<\omega => X \subseteq (-\infty,n]. (5) There is a naturally defined condition C, which
can be formalized in ZFC, such that for almost all k \in N, k satisfies the condition C if and only if
k \in X. The simplest known such condition C defines in N the set X. *** We define a set X \subseteq N.
We prove: (i) X satisfies conditions (1)-(5) except the requirement that X is naturally defined;
(ii) \Phi implies that the set X={1} \cup P satisfies conditions (1)-(5). Proving Landau's conjecture
will disprove the statements (i) and (ii). Theorem 2. No set X \subseteq N will satisfy conditions
(1)-(4) forever, if for every algorithm with no inputs that operates on integers, at some future
day, a computer will be able to execute this algorithm in 1 second or less. Physics disproves the assumption
of Theorem 2.

Consider a system of homogeneous interacting diffusive particles labeled by the nodes of a unimodular
Galton-Watson tree, where the state of each node evolves infinitesimally like a d-dimensional
diffusion whose drift coefficient depends on its own state and the states of neighboring nodes,
and whose diffusion coefficient depends only on its own state. Under suitable assumptions, an autonomous
characterization is obtained for the marginal distribution of the dynamics of the neighborhood
of a typical node in terms of a novel stochastic differential equation we call the local equation.This
equation describes a finite-dimensional non-Markovian stochastic process whose infinitesimal
evolution at any time depends not only on the structure and current state of the neighborhood, but
also on the conditional law of the current state given the past of the neighborhood process until
that time. Such marginal distributions are of interest because they arise as weak limits of both
marginal distributions and empirical measures of interacting diffusions on many sequences of
sparse random graphs, including the configuration model and Erdos-Renyi graphs whose average
degrees converge to a finite non-zero limit. The results obtained complement classical results
in the mean-field regime, which characterize the limiting dynamics of homogeneous interacting
diffusions on complete graphs, as the number of nodes goes to infinity, in terms of a corresponding
nonlinear Markov process. However, in the sparse graph setting, the topology of the graph matters,
and the analysis requires a completely different approach. Important ingredients of the proofs
include conditional independence and symmetry properties for particle trajectories on unimodular
Galton-Watson trees, a stochastic analytic result on projections of Ito processes, and a recursive
construction for establishing well-posedness of the local equation.

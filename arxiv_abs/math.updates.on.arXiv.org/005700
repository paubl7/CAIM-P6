In this work we introduce a novel semi-implicit structure-preserving finite-volume/finite-difference
scheme for the viscous and resistive equations of magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) based on an appropriate
3-split of the governing PDE system, which is decomposed into a first convective subsystem, a second
subsystem involving the coupling of the velocity field with the magnetic field and a third subsystem
involving the pressure-velocity coupling. The nonlinear convective terms are discretized explicitly,
while the remaining two subsystems accounting for the Alfven waves and the magneto-acoustic waves
are treated implicitly. The final algorithm is at least formally constrained only by a mild CFL stability
condition depending on the velocity field of the pure hydrodynamic convection. To preserve the
divergence-free constraint of the magnetic field exactly at the discrete level, a proper set of
overlapping dual meshes is employed. The resulting linear algebraic systems are shown to be symmetric
and therefore can be very efficiently solved by means of a standard matrix-free conjugate gradient
algorithm. One of the peculiarities of the presented algorithm is that the magnetic field is defined
on the edges of the main grid, while the electric field is on the faces. The final scheme can be regarded
as a novel shock-capturing, conservative and structure preserving semi-implicit scheme for the
nonlinear viscous and resistive MHD equations. Several numerical tests are presented to show the
main features of our novel solver: linear-stability in the sense of Lyapunov is verified at a prescribed
constant equilibrium solution; a 2nd-order of convergence is numerically estimated; shock-capturing
capabilities are proven against a standard set of stringent MHD shock-problems; accuracy and robustness
are verified against a nontrivial set of 2- and 3-dimensional MHD problems.

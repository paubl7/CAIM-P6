This paper treats comprehensively the construction of problems from nonlinear dynamics and constrained
optimization amenable to parameter continuation techniques and with particular emphasis on multi-segment
boundary-value problems with delay. The discussion is grounded in the context of the COCO software
package and its explicit support for community-driven development. To this end, the paper first
formalizes the COCO construction paradigm for augmented continuation problems compatible with
simultaneous analysis of implicitly defined manifolds of solutions to nonlinear equations and
the corresponding adjoint variables associated with optimization of scalar objective functions
along such manifolds. The paper uses applications to data assimilation from finite time histories
and phase response analysis of periodic orbits to identify a universal paradigm of construction
that permits abstraction and generalization. It then details the theoretical framework for a COCO-compatible
toolbox able to support the analysis of a large family of delay-coupled multi-segment boundary-value
problems, including periodic orbits, quasiperiodic orbits, connecting orbits, initial-value
problems, and optimal control problems, as illustrated in a suite of numerical examples. The paper
aims to present a pedagogical treatment that is accessible to the novice and inspiring to the expert
by appealing to the many senses of the applied nonlinear dynamicist. Sprinkled among a systematic
discussion of problem construction, graph representations of delay-coupled problems, and vectorized
formulas for problem discretization, the paper includes an original derivation using Lagrangian
sensitivity analysis of phase-response functionals for periodic-orbit problems in abstract
Banach spaces, as well as a demonstration of the regularizing benefits of multi-dimensional manifold
continuation for near-singular problems.

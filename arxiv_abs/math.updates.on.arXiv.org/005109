The uncountability of $\mathbb{R}$ (Cantor, 1874) is famous like few other theorems are; we investigate
the logical and computational properties of $\textsf{NIN}$ (resp. $\textsf{NBI}$) the statement
there is no injection (resp. bijection) from $[0,1]$ to $\mathbb{N}$. While intuitively weak,
$\textsf{NIN}$ (and similar for $\textsf{NBI}$) is classified as rather strong on the 'normal'
scale, both in terms of which comprehension axioms prove $\textsf{NIN}$ and which discontinuous
functionals compute (Kleene S1-S9) the real numbers from $\textsf{NIN}$ from the data. Indeed,
full second-order arithmetic is essential in each case. To obtain a classification in which $\textsf{NIN}$
and $\textsf{NBI}$ are weak, we explore the 'non-normal' scale based on (classically valid) continuity
axioms and non-normal functionals, going back to Brouwer. In doing so, we derive $\textsf{NIN}$
and $\textsf{NBI}$ from basic theorems, like Arzel\`a's convergence theorem for the Riemann integral
(1885) and central theorems from Reverse Mathematics formulated with the standard definition
of `countable set' involving injections or bijections to $\mathbb{N}$. Thus, the uncountability
of $\mathbb{R}$ is a corollary to basic mainstream mathematics; $\textsf{NIN}$ and $\textsf{NBI}$
are (among) the weakest principles on the non-normal scale, which serendipitously reproves many
of our previous results. Moreover, the Bolzano-Weierstrass theorem for countable sets in Cantor
space is weak, but gives rise to $\Pi_2^1$-$\textsf{CA}_0$ when combined with higher-order $\Pi_1^1$-$\textsf{CA}_0$,
i.e. the Suslin functional. Finally, $\textsf{NIN}$ and $\textsf{NBI}$ allow us to showcase to
a wide audience the techniques (like Gandy selection) used in our ongoing project on the logical
and computational properties of the uncountable.

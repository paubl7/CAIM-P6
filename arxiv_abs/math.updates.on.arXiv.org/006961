We consider generalized Nash equilibrium problems (GNEPs) with non-convex strategy spaces and
non-convex cost functions. This general class of games includes the important case of games with
mixed-integer variables for which only a few results are known in the literature. We present a new
approach to characterize equilibria via a convexification technique using the Nikaido-Isoda
function. To any given instance $I$ of the GNEP, we derive a convexified instance $I^\text{conv}$
and show that every feasible strategy profile for $I$ is an equilibrium if and only if it is an equilibrium
for $I^\text{conv}$ and the convexified cost functions coincide with the initial ones. Based on
this general result we identify important classes of GNEPs which allow us to reformulate the equilibrium
problem via standard optimization problems. $1.$ First, quasi-linear GNEPs are introduced where
for fixed strategies of the opponent players, the cost function of every player is linear and the
convex hull of the respective strategy space is polyhedral. For this game class we reformulate the
equilibrium problem for $I^\text{conv}$ as a standard (non-linear) optimization problem. $2.$
Secondly, we study GNEPs with joint constraint sets. We introduce the new class of projective-closed
GNEPs for which we show that $I^\text{conv}$ falls into the class of jointly convex GNEPs. As an important
application, we show that general GNEPs with shared binary sets $\{0,1\}^k$ are projective-closed.
$3.$ Thirdly, we discuss the class of quasi-separable GNEPs in which roughly speaking the players'
cost functions depend on their own strategy only. We show that they admit a special structure leading
to a characterization of equilibria via solutions of a convex optimization problem. $4.$ Finally,
we present numerical results regarding the computation of equilibria for a class of quasi-linear
and projective-closed GNEPs.

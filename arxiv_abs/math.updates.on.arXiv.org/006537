In holomorphic dynamics, complex box mappings arise as first return maps to well-chosen domains.
They are a generalization of polynomial-like mapping, where the domain of the return map can have
infinitely many components. They turned out to be extremely useful in tackling diverse problems.
The purpose of this paper is: -To illustrate some pathologies that can occur when a complex box mapping
is not induced by a globally defined map and when its domain has infinitely many components, and to
give conditions to avoid these issues. -To show that once one has a box mapping for a rational map,
these conditions can be assumed to hold in a very natural setting. Thus we call such complex box mappings
dynamically natural. -Many results in holomorphic dynamics rely on an interplay between combinatorial
and analytic techniques: (*)the Enhanced Nest by Kozlovski-Shen-van Strien; (*)the Covering
Lemma by Kahn-Lyubich; (*)the QC-Criterion, the Spreading Principle. The purpose of this paper
is to make these tools more accessible so that they can be used as a 'black box', so one does not have
to redo the proofs in new settings. -To give an intuitive, but also rather detailed, outline of the
proof of the following results by Kozlovski-van Strien for non-renormalizable dynamically natural
box mappings: (*)puzzle pieces shrink to points; (*)topologically conjugate non-renormalizable
polynomials and box mappings are quasiconformally conjugate. -We prove the fundamental ergodic
properties for dynamically natural box mappings. This leads to some necessary conditions for when
such a box mapping supports a measurable invariant line field on its filled Julia set. These mappings
are the analogues of Lattes maps in this setting. -We prove a version of Mane's Theorem for complex
box mappings concerning expansion along orbits of points that avoid a neighborhood of the set of
critical points.

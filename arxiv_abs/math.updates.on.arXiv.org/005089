We say that a family $\mathcal F$ of $k$-element sets is a {\it $j$-junta} if there is a set $J$ of size
$j$ such that, for any $F$, its presence in $\mathcal F$ depends on its intersection with $J$ only.
Approximating arbitrary families by $j$-juntas with small $j$ is a recent powerful technique in
extremal set theory. The weak point of all known junta approximation results is that they work in
the range $n>Ck$, where $C$ is an extremely fast growing function of the input parameters, such as
the quality of approximation or the number of families we simultaneously approximate. We say that
a family $\mathcal F$ is {\it shifted} if for any $F=\{x_1,\ldots, x_k\}\in \mathcal F$ and any $G
=\{y_1,\ldots, y_k\}$ such that $y_i\le x_i$, we have $G\in \mathcal F$. For many extremal set theory
problems, including the Erd\H os Matching Conjecture, or the Complete $t$-Intersection Theorem,
it is sufficient to deal with shifted families only. In this paper, we present very general approximation
by juntas results for shifted families with explicit (and essentially linear) dependency on the
input parameters. The results are best possible up to some constant factors. Moreover, they give
meaningful statements for almost all range of values of $n$. The proofs are shorter than the proofs
of the previous approximation by juntas results and are completely self-contained. As an application
of our junta approximation, we give a nearly-linear bound for the multi-family version of the Erd\H
os Matching Conjecture. More precisely, we prove the following result. Let $n\ge 12sk\log(e^2s)$
and suppose that the families $\mathcal F_1,\ldots, \mathcal F_s\subset {[n]\choose k}$ do not
contain $F_1\in\mathcal F_1,\ldots, F_s\in \mathcal F_s$ such that $F_i$'s are pairwise disjoint.
Then $\min_{i}|\mathcal F_i|\le {n\choose k}-{n-s+1\choose k}.$

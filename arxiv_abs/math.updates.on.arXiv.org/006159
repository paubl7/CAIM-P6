We study the position distribution $P(\vec{R},N)$ of a run-and-tumble particle (RTP) in arbitrary
dimension $d$, after $N$ runs. We assume that the constant speed $v>0$ of the particle during each
running phase is independently drawn from a probability distribution $W(v)$ and that the direction
of the particle is chosen isotropically after each tumbling. The position distribution is clearly
isotropic, $P(\vec{R},N)\to P(R,N)$ where $R=|\vec{R}|$. We show that, under certain conditions
on $d$ and $W(v)$ and for large $N$, a condensation transition occurs at some critical value of $R=R_c\sim
O(N)$ located in the large deviation regime of $P(R,N)$. For $R<R_c$ (subcritical fluid phase),
all runs are roughly of the same size in a typical trajectory. In contrast, an RTP trajectory with
$R>R_c$ is typically dominated by a `condensate', i.e., a large single run that subsumes a finite
fraction of the total displacement (supercritical condensed phase). Focusing on the family of
speed distributions $W(v)=\alpha(1-v/v_0)^{\alpha-1}/v_0$, parametrized by $\alpha>0$,
we show that, for large $N$, $P(R,N)\sim \exp\left[-N\psi_{d,\alpha}(R/N)\right]$ and we compute
exactly the rate function $\psi_{d,\alpha}(z)$ for any $d$ and $\alpha$. We show that the transition
manifests itself as a singularity of this rate function at $R=R_c$ and that its order depends continuously
on $d$ and $\alpha$. We also compute the distribution of the condensate size for $R>R_c$. Finally,
we study the model when the total duration $T$ of the RTP, instead of the total number of runs, is fixed.
Our analytical predictions are confirmed by numerical simulations, performed using a constrained
Markov chain Monte Carlo technique, with precision $\sim 10^{-100}$.

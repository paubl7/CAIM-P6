We prove comparison principles for nonlinear potential theories in euclidian spaces in a very straightforward
manner from duality and monotonicity. We shall also show how to deduce comparison principles for
nonlinear differential operators, a program seemingly different from the first. However, we shall
marry these two points of view, for a wide variety of equations, under something called the correspondence
principle. In potential theory one is given a constraint set F on the 2-jets of a function, and the
boundary of F gives a differential equation. There are many differential operators, suitably organized
around F, which give the same equation. So potential theory gives a great strengthening and simplification
to the operator theory. Conversely, the set of operators associated to F can have much to say about
the potential theory. An object of central interest here is that of monotonicity, which explains
and unifies much of the theory. We shall always assume that the maximal monotonicity cone for a potential
theory has interior. This is automatic for gradient-free equations where monotonicity is simply
the standard degenerate ellipticity and properness assumptions. We show that for each such potential
theory F there is an associated canonical operator, defined on the entire 2-jet space and having
all the desired properties. Furthermore, comparison holds for this operator on any domain which
admits a regular strictly M-subharmonic function, where M is a monotonicity subequation for F.
On the operator side there is an important dichotomy into the unconstrained cases and constrained
cases, where the operator must be restricted to a proper subset of 2-jet space. These two cases are
best illustrated by the canonical operators and Dirichlet-Garding operators, respectively.
The article gives many, many examples from pure and applied mathematics, and also from theoretical
physics.

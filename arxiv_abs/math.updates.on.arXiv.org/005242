The problem of classifying linear systems of conics in projective planes dates back at least to Jordan,
who classified pencils (one-dimensional systems) of conics over $\mathbb{C}$ and $\mathbb{R}$
in 1906--1907. The analogous problem for finite fields $\mathbb{F}_q$ with $q$ odd was solved by
Dickson in 1908. In 1914, Wilson attempted to classify nets (two-dimensional systems) of conics
over finite fields of odd characteristic, but his classification was incomplete and contained
some inaccuracies. In a recent article, we completed Wilson's classification of nets of rank one,
namely those containing a repeated line. The aim of the present paper is to introduce and calculate
certain combinatorial invariants of these nets, which we expect will be of use in various applications.
Our approach is geometric in the sense that we view a net of rank one as a plane in $\text{PG}(5,q)$
that meets the quadric Veronesean in at least one point; two such nets are then equivalent if and only
if the corresponding planes belong to the same orbit under the induced action of $\text{PGL}(3,q)$
viewed as a subgroup of $\text{PGL}(6,q)$. We have previously determined the orbits of lines in
$\text{PG}(5,q)$ under this action, which correspond to the aforementioned pencils of conics
in $\text{PG}(2,q)$. The main contribution of this paper is to determine the line-orbit distribution
of a plane $\pi$ corresponding to a net of rank one, namely, the number of lines in $\pi$ belonging
to each line orbit. It turns out that this list of invariants completely determines the orbit of $\pi$,
and we will use this fact in forthcoming work to develop an efficient algorithm for calculating the
orbit of a given net of rank one. As a more immediate application, we also determine the stabilisers
of nets of rank one in $\text{PGL}(3,q)$, and hence the orbit sizes.

As we found previously, when critical points occur within grid intervals, the accuracy relations
of smoothness indicators of WENO-JS would differ from that assuming critical points occurring
on grid nodes, and accordingly the global smoothness indicator in WENO-Z scheme will differ from
the original one. Based on above understandings, we first discuss several issues regarding current
third-order WENO-Z improvements (e.g. WENO-NP3, -F3, -NN3, -PZ3 and -P+3), i.e. the numerical
results with scale dependency, the validity of analysis assuming critical points occurring on
nodes, and the sensitivity regarding computational time step and initial condition in order convergence
studies. By analyses and numerical validations, the defections of present improvements are demonstrated,
either scale-dependency of results or failure to recover optimal order when critical points occurring
at half nodes, then a generic analysis is provided which considers the first-order critical point
occurring within grid intervals. Based on achieved theoretical outcomes, two scale-independent,
third-order WENO-Z schemes are proposed which could truly recover the optimal order at critical
points: the first one is acquired by limited expansion of grid stencil, deriving new global smoothness
indicator and incorporating with the mapping function; the second one is achieved by further expanding
grid stencil and employing a different global smoothness indicator. For validating, typical 1-D
scalar advection problems, 1-D and 2-D problems by Euler equations are chosen and tested. The consequences
verify the optimal order recovery at critical points by proposed schemes and show that: the first
scheme outperforms aforementioned third-order WENO-Z improvements in terms of numerical resolution,
while the second scheme indicates weak numerical robustness in spite of improved resolution and
is mainly of theoretical significance

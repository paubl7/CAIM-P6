This thesis focuses on three main questions in the continuous variable and optical settings: where
does a quantum advantage, that is, the ability of quantum machines to outperform classical machines,
come from? How to ensure the proper functioning of a quantum machine? What advantages can be gained
in practice from the use of quantum information? Quantum advantage in continuous variable comes
in particular from the use of so-called non-Gaussian quantum states. We introduce the stellar formalism
to characterize these states. We then study the transition from classically simulable models to
models which are universal for quantum computing. We show that quantum computational supremacy,
the dramatic speedup of quantum computers over their classical counterparts, may be realised with
non-Gaussian states and Gaussian measurements. Quantum certification denotes the methods seeking
to verify the correct functioning of a quantum machine. We consider certification of quantum states
in continuous variable, introducing several protocols according to the assumptions made on the
tested state. We develop efficient methods for the verification of a large class of multimode quantum
states, including the output states of the Boson Sampling model, enabling the experimental verification
of quantum supremacy with photonic quantum computing. We give several new examples of practical
applications of quantum information in linear quantum optics. Generalising the swap test, we highlight
a connection between the ability to distinguish two quantum states and the ability to perform universal
programmable quantum measurements, for which we give various implementations in linear optics,
based on the use of single photons or coherent states. Finally, we obtain, thanks to linear optics,
the first implementation of a quantum protocol for weak coin flipping, a building block for many
cryptographic applications.

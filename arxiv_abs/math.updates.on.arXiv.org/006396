This manuscript presents a detailed and original account of the theory of opers defined on pointed
stable curves in arbitrary characteristic and their moduli. In particular, it includes the development
of the study of dormant opers, which are opers of a certain sort in positive characteristic. The theory
of dormant opers (or more generally, opers in positive characteristic) on pointed stable curves,
which has proved to be rather rich and deep, was born in the work of S. Mochizuki, who developed the
theory for $\mathfrak{sl}_2$-opers and used it to establish $p$-adic Teichm\"{u}ller theory.
Some parts of Mochizuki's work were later extended in the case of proper smooth curves by K. Joshi,
C. Pauly, and other mathematicians. This manuscript represents an advance in the theory of opers
that takes the subject beyond the work of Mochizuki, Joshi, and Pauly. In particular, we provide
general unified formulations and the basics of principal bundles and connections defined on families
of pointed stable curves. The notion of an oper is accordingly introduced in the context of logarithmic
algebraic geometry. Some of the results can be regarded as generalizations of results obtained
in the fundamental work on the geometric Langlands program developed by A. Beilinson and V. Drinfeld.
We also describe various properties and assertions about (dormant) opers, such as duality, comparison
with differential operators, and compactification of the moduli space. Our goal is to give an explicit
formula, conjectured by Joshi, for the generic number of dormant $\mathfrak{sl}_n$-opers. We
do so by obtaining a detailed understanding of the moduli space of dormant opers and computing the
Gromov-Witten invariants for Quot-schemes in characteristic zero. This formula reveals an interaction
between studies in $p$-adic Teichm\"{u}ller theory and certain areas of mathematics, including
Gromov-Witten theory.

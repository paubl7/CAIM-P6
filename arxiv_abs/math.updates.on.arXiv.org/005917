Understanding principles of neurolocomotion requires the synthesis of neural activity, sensory
feedback, and biomechanics. The nematode \textit{C. elegans} is an ideal model organism for studying
locomotion in an integrated neuromechanical setting because its neural circuit has a well-characterized
modular structure and its undulatory forward swimming gait adapts to the surrounding fluid with
a shorter wavelength in higher viscosity environments. This adaptive behavior emerges from the
neural modules interacting through a combination of mechanical forces, neuronal coupling, and
sensory feedback mechanisms. However, the relative contributions of these coupling modes to gait
adaptation are not understood. The model consists of repeated neuromechanical modules that are
coupled through the mechanics of the body, short-range proprioception, and gap-junctions. The
model captures the experimentally observed gait adaptation over a wide range of mechanical parameters,
provided that the muscle response to input from the nervous system is faster than the body response
to changes in internal and external forces. The modularity of the model allows the use of the theory
of weakly coupled oscillators to identify the relative roles of body mechanics, gap-junctional
coupling, and proprioceptive coupling in coordinating the undulatory gait. The analysis shows
that the wavelength of body undulations is set by the relative strengths of these three coupling
forms. In a low-viscosity fluid environment, the competition between gap-junctions and proprioception
produces a long wavelength undulation, which is only achieved in the model with sufficiently strong
gap-junctional coupling.The experimentally observed decrease in wavelength in response to increasing
fluid viscosity is the result of an increase in the relative strength of mechanical coupling, which
promotes a short wavelength.

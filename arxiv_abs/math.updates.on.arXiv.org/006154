We consider sorting by a queue that can apply a permutation from a given set over its content. This
gives us a sorting device $\mathbb{Q}_{\Sigma}$ corresponding to any shuffling method $\Sigma$
since every such method is associated with a set of permutations. Two variations of these devices
are considered - $\mathbb{Q}_{\Sigma}^{\prime}$ and $\mathbb{Q}_{\Sigma}^{\text{pop}}$.
These require the entire content of the device to be unloaded after a permutation is applied or unloaded
by each pop operation, respectively. First, we show that sorting by a deque is equivalent to sorting
by a queue that can reverse its content. Next, we focus on sorting by cuts. We prove that the set of permutations
that one can sort by using $\mathbb{Q}_{\text{cuts}}^{\prime}$ is the set of the $321$-avoiding
separable permutations. We give lower and upper bounds to the maximum number of times the device
must be used to sort a permutation. Furthermore, we give a formula for the number of $n$-permutations,
$p_{n}(\mathbb{Q}_{\Sigma}^{\prime})$, that one can sort by using $\mathbb{Q}_{\Sigma}^{\prime}$,
for any shuffling method $\Sigma$, such that the permutations associated with it are irreducible.
Next, we prove a generalization of the fact that $\mathbb{Q}_{\text{cuts}}^{\text{pop}}$ can
sort all permutations. We also show that $p_{n}(\mathbb{Q}_{\Sigma}^{\text{pop}})$ is given
by the odd indexed Fibonacci numbers $F_{2n-1}$, for any shuffling method $\Sigma$ having a specific
back-front property. The rest of the work is dedicated to a surprising conjecture inspired by Diaconis
and Graham which states that one can sort the same number of permutations of any given size by using
the devices $\mathbb{Q}_{\text{In-sh}}^{\text{pop}}$ and $\mathbb{Q}_{\text{Monge}}^{\text{pop}}$,
corresponding to the popular In-shuffle and Monge shuffling methods.

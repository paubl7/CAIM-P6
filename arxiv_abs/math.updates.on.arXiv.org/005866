In this work, we consider the fractional obstacle problem with a given obstacle $\psi$ in a bounded
domain $\Omega$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$, such that $\mathbb{K}_\psi^s=\{v\in H^s_0(\Omega):v\geq\psi\text{
a.e. in }\Omega\}\neq\emptyset$, given by\[u\in\mathbb{K}_\psi^s:\quad\langle\mathcal{L}_Au,v-u\rangle\geq\langle
F,v-u\rangle\quad\forall v\in\mathbb{K}^s_\psi\]for $F$ in $H^{-s}(\Omega)$, the dual space
of the fractional Sobolev space $H^s_0(\Omega),0<s<1$. The nonlocal operator $\mathcal{L}_A:H^s_0(\Omega)\to
H^{-s}(\Omega)$ is defined with the distributional Riesz fractional derivatives and a measurable,
bounded, positive definite matrix $A:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^{d\times d}$ by\[\mathcal{L}_Au(x)=-D^s\cdot
A(x)D^su(x).\] We show that the bilinear form\[\mathcal{E}_A(u,v):=\int_\Omega AD^su\cdot
D^sv=\langle\mathcal{L}_Au,v\rangle=\int_\Omega v(x)\int_\Omega(u(x)-u(z))k_A(x,z)dzdx\]is
a (not necessarily symmetric) Dirichlet form that corresponds to a nonlocal integral operator
with a well defined integral kernel $k_A$. We consider obstacle-type problems involving the bilinear
form $\mathcal{E}_A$ with one or two obstacles, as well as the $N$-membranes problem, deriving
several results such as the weak maximum principle, comparison properties, approximation by bounded
penalization and Lewy-Stampacchia inequalities, similarly to the classical obstacle problem
which is obtained as $s\to1$. This provides regularity of the solutions, including a global $L^\infty$
estimate, local H\"older regularity of the solutions for $A$ symmetric, and local regularity in
fractional Sobolev spaces when $A$ is the identity so $\mathcal{L}_A=(-\Delta)^s$ corresponds
to $s$-Laplacian obstacle-type problems. These novel results are complemented with the extension
of the Lewy-Stampacchia inequalities to the order dual of $H^s_0(\Omega)$ and some remarks on the
associated $s$-capacity and $s$-obstacle problem.

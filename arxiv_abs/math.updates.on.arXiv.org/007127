Let $K$ be a totally real number field of degree $n \geq 2$. The inverse different of $K$ gives rise
to a lattice in $\mathbb{R}^n$. We prove that the space of Schwartz Fourier eigenfunctions on $\mathbb{R}^n$
which vanish on the "component-wise square root" of this lattice, is infinite dimensional. This
Fourier non-uniqueness set is a discrete subset of the union of all spheres $\sqrt{m}S^{n-1}$ for
integers $m \geq 0$ and, as $m \rightarrow \infty$, there are $\sim c_{K} m^{n-1}$ many points on
the $m$-th sphere for some explicit constant $c_{K}$, proportional to the square root of the discriminant
of $K$. This contrasts a recent Fourier uniqueness result by Stoller [16, Cor.1.1]. Using a different
construction involving the codifferent of $K$, we prove an analogue of our results for discrete
subsets of ellipsoids. In special cases, these sets also lie on spheres with more densely spaced
radii, but with fewer points on each. We also study a related question about existence of Fourier
interpolation formulas with nodes "$\sqrt{\Lambda}$" for general lattices $\Lambda \subset
\mathbb{R}^n$. Using results about lattices in Lie groups of higher rank, we prove that, if $n \geq
2$ and if a certain group $\Gamma_{\Lambda} \leq \operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})^n$ is discrete,
then such interpolation formulas cannot exist. Motivated by this, we revisit the case of one radial
variable and prove, for all $n \geq 5$ and all real $\lambda > 2$, Fourier interpolation results for
sequences of spheres $\sqrt{2 m/ \lambda}S^{n-1}$, where $m$ ranges over any fixed cofinite set
of non-negative integers. The proof relies on a series of Poincar{\'e} type for Hecke groups of infinite
covolume in $\operatorname{PSL}_2(\mathbb{R})$, similarly to [16, Section 4].

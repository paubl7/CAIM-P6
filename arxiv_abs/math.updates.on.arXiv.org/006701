We consider a wireless source localization network in which a target node emits localization signals
that are used by anchor nodes to estimate the target node position. In addition to target and anchor
nodes, there can also exist eavesdropper nodes and jammer nodes which aim to estimate the position
of the target node and to degrade the accuracy of localization, respectively. We first propose the
problem of eavesdropper selection with the goal of optimally placing a given number of eavesdropper
nodes to a subset of possible positions in the network to estimate the target node position as accurately
as possible. As the performance metric, the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) related to the estimation
of the target node position by eavesdropper nodes is derived, and its convexity and monotonicity
properties are investigated. By relaxing the integer constraints, the eavesdropper selection
problem is approximated by a convex optimization problem and algorithms are proposed for eavesdropper
selection. Moreover, in the presence of parameter uncertainty, a robust version of the eavesdropper
selection problem is developed. Then, the problem of jammer selection is proposed where the aim
is to optimally place a given number of jammer nodes to a subset of possible positions for degrading
the localization accuracy of the network as much as possible. A CRLB expression from the literature
is used as the performance metric, and its concavity and monotonicity properties are derived. Also,
a convex optimization problem and its robust version are derived after relaxation. Moreover, the
joint eavesdropper and jammer selection problem is proposed with the goal of placing certain numbers
of eavesdropper and jammer nodes to a subset of possible positions. Simulation results are presented
to illustrate performance of the proposed algorithms.

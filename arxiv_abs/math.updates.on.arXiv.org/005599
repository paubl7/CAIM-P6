In this paper, we are interested in systems with multiple agents that wish to collaborate in order
to accomplish a common task while a) agents have different information (decentralized information)
and b) agents do not know the model of the system completely i.e., they may know the model partially
or may not know it at all. The agents must learn the optimal strategies by interacting with their environment
i.e., by decentralized Reinforcement Learning (RL). The presence of multiple agents with different
information makes decentralized reinforcement learning conceptually more difficult than centralized
reinforcement learning. In this paper, we develop a decentralized reinforcement learning algorithm
that learns $\epsilon$-team-optimal solution for partial history sharing information structure,
which encompasses a large class of decentralized control systems including delayed sharing, control
sharing, mean field sharing, etc. Our approach consists of two main steps. In the first step, we convert
the decentralized control system to an equivalent centralized POMDP (Partially Observable Markov
Decision Process) using an existing approach called common information approach. However, the
resultant POMDP requires the complete knowledge of system model. To circumvent this requirement,
in the second step, we introduce a new concept called "Incrementally Expanding Representation"
using which we construct a finite-state RL algorithm whose approximation error converges to zero
exponentially fast. We illustrate the proposed approach and verify it numerically by obtaining
a decentralized Q-learning algorithm for two-user Multi Access Broadcast Channel (MABC) which
is a benchmark example for decentralized control systems.

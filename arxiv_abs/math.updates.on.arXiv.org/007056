(Due to the limit on the number of characters for an abstract set by arXiv, the full abstract can not
be displayed here. See the abstract in the paper.) We study the construction of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure
and complete the program on the (non-)construction of the focusing Gibbs measures, initiated by
Lebowitz, Rose, and Speer (1988). This problem turns out to be critical, exhibiting the following
phase transition. In the weakly nonlinear regime, we prove normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure
and show that it is singular with respect to the massive Gaussian free field. Moreover, we show that
there exists a shifted measure with respect to which the $\Phi^3_3$-measure is absolutely continuous.
In the strongly nonlinear regime, by further developing the machinery introduced by the authors
(2020), we establish non-normalizability of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure. Due to the singularity of
the $\Phi^3_3$-measure with respect to the massive Gaussian free field, this non-normalizability
part poses a particular challenge as compared to our previous works. In order to overcome this issue,
we first construct a $\sigma$-finite version of the $\Phi^3_3$-measure and show that this measure
is not normalizable. Furthermore, we prove that the truncated $\Phi^3_3$-measures have no weak
limit in a natural space, even up to a subsequence. We also study the dynamical problem. By adapting
the paracontrolled approach, in particular from the works by Gubinelli, Koch, and the first author
(2018) and by the authors (2020), we prove almost sure global well-posedness of the hyperbolic $\Phi^3_3$-model
and invariance of the Gibbs measure in the weakly nonlinear regime. In the globalization part, we
introduce a new, conceptually simple and straightforward approach, where we directly work with
the (truncated) Gibbs measure, using the variational formula and ideas from theory of optimal transport.

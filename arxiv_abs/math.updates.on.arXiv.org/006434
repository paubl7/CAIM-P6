Aerodynamic optimization is ubiquitous in the design of most engineering systems interacting
with fluids. A common approach is to optimize a performance function defined by a choice of an aerodynamic
model, e.g., turbulence RANS model, and at nominal operating conditions. Practical experience
indicates that such a deterministic approach may result in considerably sub-optimal designs when
the adopted aerodynamic model does not lead to accurate flow predictions or when the actual operating
conditions differ from those considered in the design. One approach to address this shortcoming
is to consider an average or robust design, wherein the statistical moments of the performance function,
given the uncertainty in the operating conditions and the aerodynamic model, is optimized. However,
when the number of uncertain inputs is large or the performance function exhibits significant variability,
an accurate evaluation of these moments may require a large number of forward and/or adjoint solves,
at each iteration of a gradient-based scheme. This, in turn, renders the design computationally
expensive, if not infeasible. To tackle this difficulty, we consider a variant of the stochastic
gradient descent method where, in each optimization iteration, a stochastic approximation of
the objective, constraints, and their gradients are generated. This is done via a small number of
forward/adjoint solves corresponding to random selections of the uncertain parameters and aerodynamic
model. The methodology is applied to the robust optimization of the standard NACA-0012 subject
to parametric and turbulence model uncertainty. With a cost that is a small factor larger than that
of the deterministic approach, the stochastic gradient approach significantly improves the performance
(mean and variance) of the aerodynamic design for a wide range of operating conditions and turbulence
models.

This paper aims to systematically solve stochastic team optimization of large-scale system, in
a rather general framework. Concretely, the underlying large-scale system involves considerable
weakly-coupled cooperative agents for which the individual admissible controls: (\textbf{i})
enter the diffusion terms, (\textbf{ii}) are constrained in some closed-convex subsets, and (\textbf{iii})
subject to a general \emph{partial decentralized information} structure. A more important but
serious feature: (\textbf{iv}) all agents are heterogenous with \emph{continuum} instead \emph{finite}
diversity. Combination of (\textbf{i})-(\textbf{iv}) yields a quite general modeling of stochastic
team-optimization, but on the other hand, also fails current existing techniques of team analysis.
In particular, classical team consistency with continuum heterogeneity collapses because of
(\textbf{i}). As the resolution, a novel \emph{unified approach} is proposed under which the intractable
\emph{continuum} \emph{heterogeneity} can be converted to a more tractable \emph{homogeneity}.
As a trade-off, the underlying randomness is augmented, and all agents become (quasi) weakly-exchangeable.
Such approach essentially involves a subtle balance between homogeneity v.s. heterogeneity,
and left (prior-sampling)- v.s. right (posterior-sampling) information filtration. Subsequently,
the consistency condition (CC) system takes a new type of forward-backward stochastic system with
\emph{double-projections} (due to (\textbf{ii}), (\textbf{iii})), along with \emph{spatial
mean} on continuum heterogenous index (due to (\textbf{iv})). Such system is new in team literature
and its well-posedness is also challenging. We address this issue under mild conditions. Related
asymptotic optimality is also established.

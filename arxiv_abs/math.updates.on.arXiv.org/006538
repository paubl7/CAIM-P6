Given a 0-1 infinite matrix $A$ and its countable Markov shift $\Sigma_A$, one of the authors and
M. Laca have introduced a kind of {\it generalized countable Markov shift} (GCMS) $X_A=\Sigma_A
\cup Y_A$, where $Y_A$ is a special set of finite admissible words. For some of the most studied countable
Markov shifts (CMS) $\Sigma_A$, $X_A$ is a compactification of $\Sigma_A$, and it is always at least
locally compact. This compactification depends only on the matrix $A$ and it does not need any extra
structure. We developed the thermodynamic formalism on the space $X_A$, by studying conformal
and eigenmeasures on $X_A$, and its connections with standard measures on $\Sigma_A$. New phenomena
appear, such as new conformal measures that are not detected in the classical thermodynamic formalism
when the matrix $A$ is not row-finite, and a {\it length-type phase transition}, when the eigenmeasure
lives on $\Sigma_A$ at high temperature and lives on $Y_A$ at low temperature. Using a pressure-point
definition proposed by M. Denker and M. Yuri for iterated function systems, we proved the Gurevich
pressure is the natural definition for the pressure function also in the generalized setting. The
Gurevich entropy plays a role in the critical temperature to the existence of new conformal measures
(KMS states) living on $Y_A$. We exhibit examples with infinitely (even uncountable) many new extremal
conformal measures, which are undetectable in the usual formalism. We characterized a basis of
the topology of $X_A$ to study the weak$^*$ convergence of measures on $X_A$, and we show some cases
where the conformal measures living on $Y_A$ converges to a conformal one living on $\Sigma_A$,
by decreasing $\beta$. For locally compact Hausdorff second countable spaces, we prove the equivalence
among several notions of conformality, including quasi-invariant measures for generalized Renault-Deaconu
groupoids.

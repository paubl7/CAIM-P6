Distributed linearly separable computation, where a user asks some distributed servers to compute
a linearly separable function, was recently formulated by the same authors and aims to alleviate
the bottlenecks of stragglers and communication cost in distributed computation. For this purpose,
the data center assigns a subset of input datasets to each server, and each server computes some coded
packets on the assigned datasets, which are then sent to the user. The user should recover the task
function from the answers of a subset of servers, such the effect of stragglers could be tolerated.
In this paper, we formulate a novel secure framework for this distributed linearly separable computation,
where we aim to let the user only retrieve the desired task function without obtaining any other information
about the input datasets, even if it receives the answers of all servers. In order to preserve the
security of the input datasets, some common randomness variable independent of the datasets should
be introduced into the transmission. We show that any non-secure linear-coding based computing
scheme for the original distributed linearly separable computation problem, can be made secure
without increasing the communication cost. Then we focus on the case where the computation cost
of each server is minimum and aim to minimize the size of the randomness variable introduced in the
system while achieving the optimal communication cost. We first propose an information theoretic
converse bound on the randomness size. We then propose secure computing schemes based on two well-known
data assignments, namely fractional repetition assignment and cyclic assignment. We then propose
a computing scheme with novel assignment, which strictly outperforms the above two schemes. Some
additional optimality results are also obtained.

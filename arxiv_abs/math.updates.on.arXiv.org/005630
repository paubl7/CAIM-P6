Terahertz (THz) massive multiple-input multipleoutput (MIMO) has been considered as one of the
promising technologies for future 6G wireless communications. It is essential to obtain channel
information by beam tracking scheme to track mobile users in THz massive MIMO systems. However,
the existing beam tracking schemes designed for narrowband systems with the traditional hybrid
precoding structure suffer from a severe performance loss caused by the beam split effect, and thus
cannot be directly applied to wideband THz massive MIMO systems. To solve this problem, in this paper
we propose a beam zooming based beam tracking scheme by considering the recently proposed delay-phase
precoding structure for THz massive MIMO. Specifically, we firstly prove the beam zooming mechanism
to flexibly control the angular coverage of frequencydependent beams over the whole bandwidth,
which can be realized by the elaborate design of time delays in the delay-phase precoding structure.
Then, based on this beam zooming mechanism, we propose to track multiple user physical directions
simultaneously in each time slot by generating multiple beams. The angular coverage of these beams
is flexibly zoomed to adapt to the potential variation range of the user physical direction. After
several time slots, the base station is able to obtain the exact user physical direction by finding
out the beam with the largest user received power. Unlike traditional schemes where only one frequency-independent
beam can be usually generated by one radio-frequency chain, the proposed beam zooming based beam
tracking scheme can simultaneously track multiple user physical directions by using multiple
frequency-dependent beams generated by one radio-frequency chain. Theoretical analysis shows
that the proposed scheme can achieve the near-optimal achievable sum-rate performance with low
beam training overhead.

Elaborating on works by Abouzaid and Mescher, we prove that for a Morse function on a smooth compact
manifold, its Morse cochain complex can be endowed with an $\Omega B As$-algebra structure by counting
moduli spaces of perturbed Morse gradient trees. This rich structure descends to its already known
$A_\infty$-algebra structure. We then introduce the notion of $\Omega B As$-morphism between
two $\Omega B As$-algebras and prove that given two Morse functions, one can construct an $\Omega
B As$-morphism between their associated $\Omega B As$-algebras by counting moduli spaces of two-colored
perturbed Morse gradient trees. This morphism induces a standard $A_\infty$-morphism between
the induced $A_\infty$-algebras. We work with integer coefficients, and provide to this extent
a detailed account on the sign conventions for $A_\infty$ (resp. $\Omega B As$)-algebras and $A_\infty$
(resp. $\Omega B As$)-morphisms, using polytopes (resp. moduli spaces) which explicitly realize
the dg-operadic objects encoding them. Our proofs also involve building at the level of polytopes
an explicit functor from the category of $\Omega B As$-algebras to the category of $A_\infty$-algebras,
drawing from a result by Markl and Shnider. This paper comes in particular with a detailed survey
on operads, $A_\infty$-algebras and $A_\infty$-morphisms, the associahedra and the multiplihedra,
as well as some details on the usual techniques used in symplectic topology to define algebraic structures
on geometrical (co)chain complexes. It moreover lays the basis for a second article in which we solve
the problem of finding a satisfactory homotopic notion of higher morphisms between $A_\infty$-algebras
and between $\Omega B As$-algebras, and show how this higher algebra of $A_\infty$ and $\Omega B
As$-algebras naturally arises in the context of Morse theory.

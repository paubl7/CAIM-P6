In this work, the Bayesian approach to inverse problems is formulated in an all-at-once setting.
The advantages of the all-at-once formulation are known to include the avoidance of a parameter-to-state
map as well as numerical improvements, especially when considering nonlinear problems. In the
Bayesian approach, prior knowledge is taken into account with the help of a prior distribution.
In addition, the error in the observation equation is formulated by means of a distribution. This
method naturally results in a whole posterior distribution for the unknown target, not just point
estimates. This allows for further statistical analysis including the computation of credible
intervals. We combine the Bayesian setting with the all-at-once formulation, resulting in a novel
approach for investigating inverse problems. With this combination we are able to chose a prior
not only for the parameter, but also for the state variable, which directly influences the parameter.
Furthermore, errors not only in the observation equation, but additionally, in the model can be
taken into account. %The aim of this approach is not only to accomplish reasonable reconstructions
of the unknown parameter but also to maximize the information gained from measurements through
combining it with prior knowledge, obtained either from certain expertise or former investigation
in the model. We analyze this approach with the help of two linear standard examples, namely the inverse
source problem for the Poisson equation and the backwards heat equation, i.e. a stationary and a
time dependent problem. Appropriate function spaces and derivation of adjoint operators are investigated.
To assess the degree of ill-posedness, we analyze the singular values of the corresponding all-at-once
forward operators. %as well as the convergence of the method. Finally, joint priors are designed
and numerically tested.

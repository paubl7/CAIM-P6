The second author stated a conjecture, dynamical degree comparison conjecture, on dynamical degrees
of rational maps (and more generally, dynamical correspondences) of smooth projective varieties,
relating the pullback of (dynamical) iterates of correspondences on \'etale cohomology groups
and on cycle class groups. This conjecture contains as special cases both the celebrated Weil's
Riemann hypothesis and the positive characteristic analog of Serre's results on polarized endomorphisms.
Over finite fields, one significant consequence of Weil's Riemann hypothesis is the standard conjecture
$C$. In this paper, we explore motivic analogs of dynamical degree comparison conjecture. We show
some subtleties regarding these motivic analogs, and that there are some interesting interrelations
between these conjectures and the well-known standard conjectures. As a tool to resolve these conjectures,
we propose (among several others) a new conjecture, named Conjecture $G_r$, which is slightly stronger
than the standard conjecture $C$ and sufficient to obtain dynamical degree comparison conjecture,
for all positive linear combinations of self-morphisms. Under the additional assumption of the
standard conjecture $D$, dynamical degree comparison conjecture and its motivic analogs hold.
Conjecture $G_r$ and the standard conjecture $D$, for our purpose, can be regarded as a replacement
of the various positive notions (forms, currents) in K\"ahler geometry - which currently are not
available in positive characteristic. To illustrate the main results, several examples - involving
curves, Abelian varieties, surfaces, threefolds, algebraically stable correspondences, as
well as the case where the ground field has characteristic zero - are given. Along the way, we show
that for surfaces and threefolds, dynamical degree comparison conjecture descents to finite quotients.

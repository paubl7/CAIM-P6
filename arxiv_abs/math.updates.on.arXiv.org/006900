This paper studies the optimal spatial pricing for a ride-sourcing platform subject to a congestion
charge. The platform determines the ride prices over the transportation network to maximize its
profit, while the regulatory agency imposes the congestion charge to reduce traffic congestion
in the urban core. A network economic equilibrium model is proposed to capture the intimate interactions
among passenger demand, driver supply, passenger and driver waiting times, platform pricing,
vehicle repositioning and flow balance over the transportation network. The overall optimal pricing
problem is cast as a non-convex program. An algorithm is proposed to approximately compute its optimal
solution, and a tight upper bound is established to evaluate its performance loss with respect to
the globally optimal solution. Using the proposed model, we compare the impacts of three forms of
congestion charge: (a) a one-directional cordon charge on ride-sourcing vehicles that enter the
congestion area; (b) a bi-directional cordon charge on ride-sourcing vehicles that enter or exit
the congestion area; (c) a trip-based congestion charge on all ride-sourcing trips. We show that
the one-directional congestion charge not only reduces the ride-sourcing traffic in the congestion
area, but also reduces the travel cost outside the congestion zone and benefits passengers in these
underserved areas. We further show that compared to other congestion charges, the one-directional
cordon charge is more effective in congestion mitigation: to achieve the same congestion-mitigation
target, it imposes a smaller cost on passengers, drivers, and the platform. On the other hand, compared
with the other charges, the trip-based congestion charge is more effective in revenue-raising:
to raise the same tax revenue, it leads to a smaller loss to passengers, drivers, and the platform.

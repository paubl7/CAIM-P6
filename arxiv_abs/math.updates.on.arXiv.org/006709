This paper concerns elliptic (pseudo-)differential Hamiltonians modeling topological insulators
and superconductors in Euclidean space. We augment the Hamiltonian by one or several domain walls,
which model conducting hyper-surfaces separating insulating bulk half-spaces. The resulting
confinement naturally yields a Fredholm operator, whose index describes the topological charge
of the system. A defining property of topological insulators is the asymmetric transport observed
along one-dimensional conducting lines generated by the domain walls. This asymmetric transport
is captured by a line conductivity, a physical observable of the system. We prove a topological charge
conservation result stating that the line conductivity is quantized and equals the topological
charge. This result generalizes to higher dimensions and higher-order topological insulators
the bulk-edge correspondence of two-dimensional materials. It also displays the stability of
the quantized transport asymmetry against perturbations of the Hamiltonian that preserve its
index. The charge conservation provides an efficient computation of the line conductivity directly
from the symbol of the pseudo-differential operator by means of a Fedosov-H\"ormander formula,
which implements in Euclidean spaces an Atiyah-Singer index theorem. When the Hamiltonian admits
an appropriate decomposition in a Clifford algebra, we show that the Fedosov-H\"ormander formula
equals the easily computable degree of a map naturally associated to the Hamiltonian. We apply this
procedure to evaluate the topological charge of several classical examples of (standard and higher-order)
topological insulators and superconductors in one, two, and three spatial dimensions.

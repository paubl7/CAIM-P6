We study a constrained shortest path problem in group-labeled graphs with nonnegative edge length,
called the shortest non-zero path problem. Depending on the group in question, this problem includes
two types of tractable variants in undirected graphs: one is the parity-constrained shortest path/cycle
problem, and the other is computing a shortest noncontractible cycle in surface-embedded graphs.
For the shortest non-zero path problem with respect to finite abelian groups, Kobayashi and Toyooka
(2017) proposed a randomized, pseudopolynomial-time algorithm via permanent computation. For
a slightly more general class of groups, Yamaguchi (2016) showed a reduction of the problem to the
weighted linear matroid parity problem. In particular, some cases are solved in strongly polynomial
time via the reduction with the aid of a deterministic, polynomial-time algorithm for the weighted
linear matroid parity problem developed by Iwata and Kobayashi (2021), which generalizes a well-known
fact that the parity-constrained shortest path problem is solved via weighted matching. In this
paper, as the first general solution independent of the group, we present a rather simple, deterministic,
and strongly polynomial-time algorithm for the shortest non-zero path problem. The algorithm
is based on Dijkstra's algorithm for the unconstrained shortest path problem and Edmonds' blossom
shrinking technique in matching algorithms, which is inspired by Derigs' faster algorithm (1985)
for the parity-constrained shortest path problem via a reduction to weighted matching. Furthermore,
we improve our algorithm so that it does not require explicit blossom shrinking, and make the computational
time match Derigs' one. In the speeding-up step, a dual linear programming formulation of the equivalent
problem based on potential maximization for the unconstrained shortest path problem plays a key
role.

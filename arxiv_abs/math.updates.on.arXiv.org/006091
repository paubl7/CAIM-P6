The field of dynamical systems is being transformed by the mathematical tools and algorithms emerging
from modern computing and data science. First-principles derivations and asymptotic reductions
are giving way to data-driven approaches that formulate models in operator theoretic or probabilistic
frameworks. Koopman spectral theory has emerged as a dominant perspective over the past decade,
in which nonlinear dynamics are represented in terms of an infinite-dimensional linear operator
acting on the space of all possible measurement functions of the system. This linear representation
of nonlinear dynamics has tremendous potential to enable the prediction, estimation, and control
of nonlinear systems with standard textbook methods developed for linear systems. However, obtaining
finite-dimensional coordinate systems and embeddings in which the dynamics appear approximately
linear remains a central open challenge. The success of Koopman analysis is due primarily to three
key factors: 1) there exists rigorous theory connecting it to classical geometric approaches for
dynamical systems, 2) the approach is formulated in terms of measurements, making it ideal for leveraging
big-data and machine learning techniques, and 3) simple, yet powerful numerical algorithms, such
as the dynamic mode decomposition (DMD), have been developed and extended to reduce Koopman theory
to practice in real-world applications. In this review, we provide an overview of modern Koopman
operator theory, describing recent theoretical and algorithmic developments and highlighting
these methods with a diverse range of applications. We also discuss key advances and challenges
in the rapidly growing field of machine learning that are likely to drive future developments and
significantly transform the theoretical landscape of dynamical systems.

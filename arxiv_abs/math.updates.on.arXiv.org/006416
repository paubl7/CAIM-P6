We prove various results that, given a sufficiently rich subgroup $G$ of the group of homeomorphisms
on the real line, describe the structure of the other possible actions of $G$ on the real line, and
address under which conditions such actions must be semi-conjugate to the natural defining action
of $G$. The main assumption is that $G$ should be locally moving, meaning that for every open interval
the subgroup of elements whose support is contained in such interval acts on it without fixed points.
One example (among many others) is given by Thompson's group $F$. A first rigidity result implies
that if $G$ is a locally moving group, every faithful minimal action of $G$ on the real line by $C^1$
diffeomorphisms is conjugate to its standard action. It turns out that the situation is much wilder
when considering actions by homeomorphisms: for a large class of groups, including Thompson's
group $F$, we describe uncountably many conjugacy classes of minimal faithful actions by homeomorphisms
on the real line. To gain insight on such exotic actions, we introduce and develop the notion of $\mathbb{R}$-focal
action, a class of actions on the real line that can be encoded by certain actions by homeomorphisms
on planar real trees fixing an end. Under a suitable finite generation condition on a locally moving
group $G$, we prove that every minimal faithful action of $G$ on the line is either conjugate to the
standard action, or it is $\mathbb{R}$-focal and the action on the associated real tree factors
via a horofunction onto the standard action of $G$ on the line. Among applications of this result,
we show that for a large class of locally moving groups, the standard action is locally rigid, in the
sense that every sufficiently small perturbation in the compact-open topology gives a semi-conjugate
action. This is based on an analysis of the space of harmonic actions on the line for such groups.

In this paper, we propose distributed algorithms that solve a system of Boolean equations over a
network, where each node in the network possesses only one Boolean equation from the system. The
Boolean equation assigned at any particular node is a {\em private} equation known to this node only,
and the nodes aim to compute the exact set of solutions to the system without exchanging their local
equations. We show that each private Boolean equation can be locally lifted to a linear algebraic
equation under a basis of Boolean vectors, leading to a network linear equation that is distributedly
solvable using existing distributed linear equation algorithms as a subroutine. A number of exact
or approximate solutions to the induced linear equation are then computed at each node from different
initial values. The solutions to the original Boolean equations are eventually computed locally
via a Boolean vector search algorithm. We prove that given solvable Boolean equations, when the
initial values of the nodes for the distributed linear equation solving step are i.i.d selected
according to a uniform distribution in a high-dimensional cube, our algorithms return the exact
solution set of the Boolean equations at each node with high probability. Furthermore, we present
an algorithm for distributed verification of the satisfiability of Boolean equations, and prove
its correctness. Finally, we show that by utilizing linear equation solvers with differential
privacy to replace the in-network computing routines, the overall distributed Boolean equation
algorithms can be made differentially private. Under the standard Laplace mechanism, we prove
an explicit level of noises that can be injected in the linear equation steps for ensuring a prescribed
level of differential privacy.

We consider an arbitrary metric graph, to which we glue a graph with edges of lengths proportional
to $\varepsilon$, where $\varepsilon$ is a small positive parameter. On such graph, we consider
a general self-adjoint second order differential operator $\mathcal{H}_\varepsilon$ with varying
coefficients subject to general vertex conditions; all coefficients in differential expression
and vertex conditions are supposed to be holomorphic in $\varepsilon$. We introduce a special operator
on a certain extension of the graph $\g$ and assume that it has no embedded eigenvalues at the threshold
of its essential spectrum. Under such assumption, we show that that certain parts of the resolvent
of $\mathcal{H}_\varepsilon$ are holomorphic in $\varepsilon$ and we show how to find effectively
all coefficients in their Taylor series. This allows us to represent the resolvent of $\mathcal{H}_\varepsilon$
by an uniformly converging Taylor-like series and its partial sums can be used for approximating
the resolvent up to an arbitrary power of $\varepsilon$. In particular, the zero-order approximation
reproduces recent convergence results by G. Berkolaiko, Yu. Latushkin, S. Sukhtaiev and by C. Cacciapuoti,
but we additionally show that next-to-leading terms in $\varepsilon$-expansions of the coefficients
in the differential expression and vertex conditions can contribute to the limiting operator producing
the Robin part at the vertices, to which small edges are incident. We also discuss possible generalizations
of our model including both the cases of a more general geometry of the small parts of the graph and
a non-holomorphic $\varepsilon$-dependence of the coefficients in the differential expression
and vertex conditions.

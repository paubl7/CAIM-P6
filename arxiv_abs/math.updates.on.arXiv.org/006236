This PhD thesis is the conclusion of some of my works carried out at the Centre de Physique Th\'eorique,
under the supervision of Serge Lazzarini. Two subjects are presented in the manuscript, both aiming
at studying the effect of the spin of elementary particles on otherwise known theories. First is
a study of the L\'evy-Leblond-Newton (LLN) equation, which is used to describe the evolution of
a quantum system with spin 1/2 that is coupled to its own gravitational potential. After reviewing
some symmetries of non relativistic Quantum Mechanics, and how to geometrize them with the help
of Bargmann structures, we recall what is the L\'evy-Leblond equation. In this chapter, the LLN
equation is described in a fully covariant way on Bargmann structures. This covariant formulation
then helps to derive the dynamical symmetries of the equation, and conserved quantities. The symmetry
group of this equation turns out to be the already known Schr\"odinger-Newton group. The second
part deals with the trajectory of particles with spin in General Relativity. We first highlight
Souriau's geometric method to derive the Mathisson-Papapetrou-Dixon (MPD) equations, and then
discuss the different possible Spin Supplementary Conditions (SSC) that exist to close the system
of MPD equations. In this chapter, we assume the Tulczyjew SSC to describe the trajectory of photons,
leading to the Souriau-Saturnini equations. We then present some works where we have applied these
equations, in a Schwarzschild spacetime, and in a spacetime deformed by a gravitational wave. In
the first work, we found gravitational birefringence: the trajectory deviates from the geodesic
plane, depending on the helicity of the photon and its wavelength. The second work presented also
found birefringence in gravitational interferometry experiments, however the effect is many
orders of magnitude lower than what we can detect.

PBZ*-lattices are bounded lattice-ordered structures endowed with two complements, called Kleene
and Brouwer; by definition, they are the paraorthomodular Brouwer-Zadeh lattices in which the
pairs of elements with their Kleene complements satisfy the Strong De Morgan condition. These algebras
arise in the study of Quantum Logics and they form a variety PBZL* which includes orthomodular lattices
with an extended signature (with the two complements coinciding), as well as antiortholattices
(whose Brouwer complements are trivial). The former turn out to have directly irreducible lattice
reducts and, under distributivity, no nontrivial elements with bounded lattice complements.
We establish a lattice isomorphism between the lattice of subvarieties of the variety SAOL generated
by the antiortholattices with the Strong De Morgan property and the ordinal sum of the three-element
chain with the lattice of subvarieties of the variety PKA of pseudo-Kleene algebras, which also
gives us axiomatizations for all subvarieties of SAOL from those of the subvarieties of PKA. The
form of this lattice isomorphism proves that the variety PKA is generated by the class of the bounded
involution lattice reducts of the members of SAOL, thus also by the quasivariety PPKA of paraorthomodular
pseudo-Kleene algebras and by the class of the bounded involution lattice reducts of the members
of PBZL*, which is strictly included in PPKA, and thus of those of any subvariety of PBZL* that includes
SAOL, which also shows that neither of these classes is a variety. We obtain an infinite ascending
chain of varieties of distributive PBZ*-lattices, which, along with the well-known infinite ascending
chain of varieties of modular ortholattices and its image through the lattice isomorphism mentioned
above, give us an infinity of pairwise disjoint infinite ascending chains of varieties of PBZ*-lattices.

Proofs of sharp phase transition and noise sensitivity in percolation have been significantly
simplified by the use of randomized algorithms, via the OSSS inequality (proved by O'Donnell, Saks,
Schramm and Servedio (2005)) and the Schramm-Steif inequality for the Fourier-Walsh coefficients
of functions defined on the Boolean hypercube. In this article, we prove intrinsic versions of the
OSSS and Schramm-Steif inequalities for functionals of a general Poisson process, and apply these
new estimates to deduce sufficient conditions - expressed in terms of randomized stopping sets
- yielding sharp phase transitions, quantitative noise sensitivity, exceptional times and bounds
on critical windows for monotonic Boolean Poisson functions. Our analysis is based on a new general
definition of `stopping set', not requiring any topological property for the underlying measurable
space, as well as on the new concept of a `continuous-time decision tree', for which we establish
several fundamental properties. We apply our findings to the $k$-percolation of the Poisson Boolean
model and to the Poisson-based confetti percolation with bounded random grains. In these two models,
we reduce the proof of sharp phase transitions for percolation, and of noise sensitivity for crossing
events, to the construction of suitable randomized stopping sets and the computation of one-arm
probabilities. This enables us to settle some open problem suggested by Ahlberg, Tassion and Texeira
(2018) on noise sensitivity of crossing events for the planar Poisson Boolean model and also planar
Confetti percolation model. Further, we also prove that critical probability is $1/2$ in certain
planar confetti percolation models. A special case of this result was conjectured by Benjamini
and Schramm (1998) and proved by M\"uller (2017). Other special cases were proven by Hirsch (2015)
and Ghosh and Roy (2018).

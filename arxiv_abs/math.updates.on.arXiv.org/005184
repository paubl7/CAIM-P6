The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in more than 30.35 million infections and 9, 50, 625 deaths in
212 countries over the last few months. Different drug intervention acting at multiple stages of
pathogenesis of COVID-19 can substantially reduce the infection induced mortality. The current
within-host mathematical modeling studies deals with the optimal drug regimen and the efficacy
of combined therapy in treatment of COVID-19. The drugs/interventions considered include Arbidol,
Remdesivir, Inteferon (INF) and Lopinavir/Ritonavir. It is concluded that these drug interventions
when administered individually or in combination reduce the infected cells and viral load. Four
scenarios involving administration of single drug intervention, two drug interventions, three
drug interventions and all the four have been discussed. In all these scenarios the optimal drug
regimen is proposed based on two methods. In the first method these medical interventions are modeled
as control interventions and a corresponding objective function and optimal control problem is
formulated. In this setting the optimal drug regimen is proposed. Later using the the comparative
effectiveness method the optimal drug regimen is proposed based on basic reproduction number and
viral load. The average infected cell count and viral load decreased the most when all the four interventions
were applied together. On the other hand the average susceptible cell count decreased the best when
Arbidol alone was administered. The basic reproduction number and viral count decreased the best
when all the four interventions were applied together reinstating the fact obtained earlier in
the optimal control setting. These findings may help physicians with decision making in treatment
of life-threatening COVID-19 pneumonia.

A powerful tool for analyzing and approximating the singular values and eigenvalues of structured
matrices is the theory of generalized locally Toeplitz (GLT) sequences. By the theory of GLT sequences
one can derive a function, called the symbol, which describes the singular value or eigenvalue distribution
of the sequence. However, for small value of the matrix size of the considered sequence, the approximations
may not be as exact as is attainable, since in the construction of the GLT symbol one disregards small
norm and low-rank perturbations. Local Fourier analysis (LFA) can be used to construct symbols
in a similar manner for discretizations where the geometric information is present, but here the
small norm perturbations are retained, i.e., more information is kept in the symbol. The LFA is predominantly
used in the analysis and design of multigrid methods, and to estimate the worst case spectral radius
or $2$-norm. The main focus of this paper is the introduction of the concept of a (singular value and
spectral) "momentary symbol", associated with trucated Toeplitz-like matrices. We construct
the symbol in the same way as in the theory of GLT sequences, but we keep the information of the small
norm contributions. The low-rank contributions as still disregarded, and we give an idea on why
this is negligible. Moreover, we highlight that the difference to the LFA symbols is that momentary
symbols are applicable to a much larger class of matrices. We show the applicability of the symbol,
and higher accuracy, when approximating the singular values and eigenvalues of trucated Toeplitz-like
matrices using the momentary symbol, compared with the GLT symbol. Moreover, since for many applications
and their analysis it is often necessary to consider non-square Toeplitz matrices, we formalize
and provide some useful defintions, applicable for non-square momentary symbols.

This paper deals with a version of the two-timing method which describes various slow effects caused
by externally imposed fast oscillations. Such small oscillations are often called vibrations
and the research area can be referred as vibrodynamics. In our case, the basic small parameter represents
the ratio of two time-scales; it appears in equations as a regular perturbation. We focus our study
on the hidden aspects of the two-timing method such as the uniqueness or multiplicity of distinguished
limits (DLs) and universal structures of averaged equations. The equations considered represent
a generic system of first order ODEs, containing a prescribed oscillating velocity u. The main result
is the demonstration that there are two (and only two) different DLs called DL-1 and DL-2. Calculations
show the existence of the closed systems of equations for the first few successive approximations,
and indicate that an infinite number of such closed equations are available. It is remarkable that
these equations possess \emph{universal structures}, containing a quadratic in u averaged function
called the drift velocity V, which we require to be not identically vanishing. DL-2 produces a closed
averaged system of equations in the zeroth approximation. In DL-1, the averaged equations of the
zeroth approximation formally coincide with the original system, while the first approximation
exhibits a similarity with a linearized version of the previous equation; however V appears as its
nonhomogeneous term. Possible generalizations and interpretations are briefly discussed. To
illustrate the broadness of our study, two examples from mathematical biology are discussed. The
paper is accessible for students in applied mathematics.

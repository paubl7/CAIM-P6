Markov decision processes (MDPs) are used to model stochastic systems in many applications. Several
efficient algorithms to compute optimal policies have been studied in the literature, including
value iteration (VI) and policy iteration. However, these do not scale well especially when the
discount factor for the infinite horizon discounted reward, $\lambda$, gets close to $1$. In particular,
the running time scales as $O \left( 1/(1-\lambda) \right)$ for these algorithms. In this paper,
our goal is to design new algorithms that scale better than previous approaches when $\lambda$ approaches
$1$. Our main contribution is to present a connection between VI and gradient descent and adapt the
ideas of acceleration and momentum in convex optimization to design faster algorithms for MDPs.
We prove theoretical guarantees of a faster convergence of our algorithms for the computation of
the value function of a policy, where the running times of our algorithms scale as $O \left( 1/\sqrt{1-\lambda}
\right)$ for reversible MDP instances. The improvement is quite analogous to Nesterov's acceleration
and momentum in convex optimization. We also provide a lower bound on the convergence properties
of any first-order algorithm for solving MDPs, presenting a family of MDPs instances for which no
algorithm can converge faster than VI when the number of iterations is smaller than the number of
states. We introduce a Safe Accelerated Value Iteration (S-AVI), which alternates between accelerated
updates and value iteration updates. Our algorithm S-AVI is worst-case optimal and retains the
theoretical convergence properties of VI while exhibiting strong empirical performances, providing
significant speedups compared to classical approaches (up to one order of magnitude in many cases)
for a large test bed of MDP instances.

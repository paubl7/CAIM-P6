Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs) are stealthy attacks that threaten the security and privacy
of sensitive information. Interactions of APTs with victim system introduce information flows
that are recorded in the system logs. Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) is a promising detection
mechanism for detecting APTs. DIFT taints information flows originating at system entities that
are susceptible to an attack, tracks the propagation of the tainted flows, and authenticates the
tainted flows at certain system components according to a pre-defined security policy. Deployment
of DIFT to defend against APTs in cyber systems is limited by the heavy resource and performance overhead
associated with DIFT. In this paper, we propose a resource-efficient model for DIFT by incorporating
the security costs, false-positives, and false-negatives associated with DIFT. Specifically,
we develop a game-theoretic framework and provide an analytical model of DIFT that enables the study
of trade-off between resource efficiency and the effectiveness of detection. Our game model is
a nonzero-sum, infinite-horizon, average reward stochastic game. Our model incorporates the
information asymmetry between players that arises from DIFT's inability to distinguish malicious
flows from benign flows and APT's inability to know the locations where DIFT performs a security
analysis. Additionally, the game has incomplete information as the transition probabilities
(false-positive and false-negative rates) are unknown. We propose a multiple-time scale stochastic
approximation algorithm to learn an equilibrium solution of the game. We prove that our algorithm
converges to an average reward Nash equilibrium. We evaluate our proposed model and algorithm on
a real-world ransomware dataset and validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

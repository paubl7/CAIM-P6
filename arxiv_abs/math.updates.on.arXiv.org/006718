Exponents and logarithms exist in many important applications such as logistic regression, maximum
likelihood, relative entropy and so on. Since the exponential cone can be viewed as the epigraph
of perspective of the natural exponential function or the hypograph of perspective of the natural
logarithm function, many mixed-integer nonlinear convex programs involving exponential or logarithm
functions can be recast as mixed-integer exponential conic programs (MIECPs). Recently, solver
MOSEK is able to solve large-scale continuous exponential conic programs (ECPs). However, unlike
mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) and mixed-integer second-order conic programs (MISOCPs),
MIECPs are far beyond development. To harvest the past efforts on MILPs and MISOCPs, this paper presents
second-order conic (SOC) and poly-hedral approximation schemes for the exponential cone with
application to MIECPs. To do so, we first extend and generalize existing SOC approximation approaches
in the extended space, propose new scaling and shifting methods, prove approximation accuracies,
and derive lower bounds of approximations. We then study the polyhedral outer approximation of
the exponential cones in the original space using gradient inequalities, show its approximation
accuracy, and derive a lower bound of the approximation. When implementing SOC approximations,
we suggest testing smaller cases by learning the approximation pattern and then applying to the
large-scale cases; and for the polyhedral approximation, we suggest using the cutting plane method
when solving the continuous ECP and branch and cut method for MIECPs. Our numerical study shows that
the proposed scaling, shifting, and polyhedral outer approximation methods outperform solver
MOSEK for both continuous ECPs and MIECPs and can achieve up to 20 times speed-ups compared to solver
MOSEK when solving MIECPs.

In this paper we study model reduction of linear and bilinear quadratic stochastic control problems
with parameter uncertainties. Specifically, we consider slow-fast systems with unknown diffusion
coefficient and study the convergence of the slow process in the limit of infinite scale separation.
The aim of our work is two-fold: Firstly, we want to propose a general framework for averaging and
homogenisation of multiscale systems with parametric uncertainties in the drift or in the diffusion
coefficient. Secondly, we want to use this framework to quantify the uncertainty in the reduced
system by deriving a limit equation that represents a worst-case scenario for any given (possibly
path-dependent) quantity of interest. We do so by reformulating the slow-fast system as an optimal
control problem in which the unknown parameter plays the role of a control variable that can take
values in a closed bounded set. For systems with unknown diffusion coefficient, the underlying
stochastic control problem admits an interpretation in terms of a stochastic differential equation
driven by a G-Brownian motion. We prove convergence of the slow process with respect to the nonlinear
expectation on the probability space induced by the G-Brownian motion. The idea here is to formulate
the nonlinear dynamic programming equation of the underlying control problem as a forward-backward
stochastic differential equation in the G-Brownian motion framework (in brief: G-FBSDE), for
which convergence can be proved by standard means. We illustrate the theoretical findings with
two simple numerical examples, exploiting the connection between fully nonlinear dynamic programming
equations and second-order BSDE (2BSDE): a linear quadratic Gaussian regulator problem and a bilinear
multiplicative triad that is a standard benchmark system in turbulence and climate modelling.

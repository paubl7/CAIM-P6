Linear Fisher markets are a fundamental economic model with applications in fair division as well
as large-scale Internet markets. In the finite-dimensional case of $n$ buyers and $m$ items, a market
equilibrium can be computed using the Eisenberg-Gale convex program. Motivated by large-scale
Internet advertising and fair division applications, this paper considers a generalization of
a linear Fisher market where there is a finite set of buyers and a continuum of items. We introduce
generalizations of the Eisenberg-Gale convex program and its dual to this infinite-dimensional
setting, which leads to Banach-space optimization problems. We establish existence of optimal
solutions, strong duality, as well as necessity and sufficiency of KKT-type conditions. All these
properties are established via non-standard arguments, which circumvent the limitations of duality
theory in optimization over infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. Furthermore, we show that there
exists a pure equilibrium allocation, i.e., a division of the item space. When the item space is a
closed interval and buyers have piecewise linear valuations, we show that the Eisenberg-Gale-type
convex program over the infinite-dimensional allocations can be reformulated as a finite-dimensional
convex conic program, which can be solved efficiently using off-the-shelf optimization software
based on primal-dual interior-point methods. Based on our convex conic reformulation, we develop
the first polynomial-time cake-cutting algorithm that achieves Pareto optimality, envy-freeness,
and proportionality. For general buyer valuations or a very large number of buyers, we propose computing
market equilibrium using stochastic dual averaging, which finds approximate equilibrium prices
with high probability. Finally, we discuss how the above results easily extend to the case of quasilinear
utilities.

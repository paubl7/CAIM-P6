Let $\left( g\left( x \right),xg\left( x \right) \right)$ be a Riordan matrix from the Bell subgroup.
We denote ${{\left( g\left( x \right),xg\left( x \right) \right)}^{\varphi }}=\left( {{g}^{\left(
\varphi \right)}}\left( x \right),x{{g}^{\left( \varphi \right)}}\left( x \right) \right)$,
where a matrix power is defined in the standard way. The polynomials ${{c}_{n}}\left( x \right)$
such that ${{g}^{\left( \varphi \right)}}\left( x \right)=\sum\nolimits_{n=0}^{\infty }{{{c}_{n}}}\left(
\varphi \right){{x}^{n}}$ will be called composition polynomials. We consider the composition
polynomials of the RNA matrix. The construction associated with these polynomials allows the following
generalization. If the matrix $\left( g\left( x \right),xg\left( x \right) \right)$ is a pseudo-involution,
then there exists a numerical sequence ($B$-sequence) with the generating function $B\left( x
\right)$ such that $g\left( x \right)=1+xg\left( x \right)B\left( {{x}^{2}}g\left( x \right)
\right)$. The matrix whose $B$-sequence has the generating function $\varphi B\left( x \right)$
will be denoted by $\left( {{g}^{\left[ \varphi \right]}}\left( x \right),x{{g}^{\left[ \varphi
\right]}}\left( x \right) \right)$. The polynomials ${{u}_{n}}\left( x \right)$ such that ${{g}^{\left[
\varphi \right]}}\left( x \right)=\sum\nolimits_{n=0}^{\infty }{{{u}_{n}}}\left( \varphi
\right){{x}^{n}}$ will be called $B$-composition polynomials. Coefficients of these polynomials
are expressed in terms of the $B$-sequence. We show that matrices whose rows correspond to the $B$-composition
polynomials are connected with exponential Riordan matrices of the Lagrange subgroup in a certain
way. The cases $B\left( x \right)={{\left( 1-x \right)}^{-1}}$ (RNA matrix), $B\left( x \right)=1+x$,
$B\left( x \right)=C\left( x \right)$, where $C\left( x \right)$ is the Catalan series, are considered
in detail.

We consider random partitions of the vertex set of a given finite graph that can be sampled by means
of loop-erased random walks stopped at a random independent exponential time of parameter $q>0$.
The related random blocks tend to cluster nodes visited by the random walk associated to the graph
on time scale $1/q$. This random partitioning is induced by a measure of spanning rooted forest of
the graph which naturally generalize the classical uniform spanning tree measure and which can
be obtained as a "zero-limit" of FK-percolation with an external cemetery state. General properties
of this rooted forest measure and related determinantal observables, along with a number of applications
in data analysis have been recently explored. We are here interested in understanding the emergent
partitioning, referred to as loop-erased partitioning, as the intensity parameter $q$ scales
with the graph size. Some first results in this direction have been investigated in the recent [arXiv:1906.03858]
for dense geometries. In this work we instead look at very sparse geometries. We start by characterising
monotone events in $q$ by deriving a general Russo-like formula for this rooted arboreal gas measure.
We then explore the resulting clusters on simple insightful tree-like graphs by looking at the probability
that two given vertices do not belong to the same block. In particular, a detailed analysis of the
resulting integer partitioning on line segments is pursued. We finally look at simple trees and
other almost tree-like geometries, without and with implanted modular structures. For the latter,
we characterize the emergence of giants and asymptotic detection of these implanted modules as
the scale parameter $q$ varies.

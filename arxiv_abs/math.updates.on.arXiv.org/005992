This paper concerns the modeling and numerical simulation of the process of speciation. In particular,
given conditions for which one or more speciation events within an ecosystem occur, our aim is to
develop the modeling and simulation tools necessary to handle such events. The model we employ can
be considered as an extension of the classical Lotka-Volterra model, where in addition to the species
abundance, the model also governs the evolution of the species mean traits and species trait covariances,
and in this sense generalizes the purely ecological Lotka-Volterra model to an eco-evolutionary
model. Although the model thus allows for evolving species, by construction, it is not able to handle
speciation events due to a breakdown of the underlying assumptions on which the model is derived
(i.e., unambiguous identification of distinct species in the fitness landscape). Thus, the fundamental
problem to overcome regarding speciation is that the unit of species is too coarse to capture the
fine-scale dynamics of a speciation event. Our strategy is twofold; monitoring the species in the
system and detecting speciation in advance, and, splitting the diverging `parent'-species into
new `child'-species. Since the problem at hand is related to that of separate scales, it is convenient
to have access to a fine-scale description of the same eco-evolutionary system. For this, we employ
a trait-specific population density model governing the dynamics of the abundance density as a
function of evolutionary traits. At this scale there is no a priori definition of species, but both
species and speciation may be defined a posteriori as e.g., local maxima and saddle points of the
population density, respectively.

From the Lytchak's result for polar foliations on an irreducible simply connected symmetric space
$G/K$ of compact type and rank greater than one, we can derive that there exists no equifocal submanifold
with non-flat section whose codimension is greater than two in the symmetric space $G/K$. In the
first-half part of this paper, we give a new proof of this non-existence theorem. The recipi of our
new proof is as follows. Suppose that there exists an equifocal submanifold $M$ with non-flat section
whose codimension is greater than two in an irreducible symmertric space $G/K$ of compact type and
rank greater than one. We introduce the notion of a slice topology of $G/K$ associated to $M$. We consider
the universal covering $\pi:\widehat{G/K}\to G/K$ of the slice topological space $G/K$ and give
$\widehat{G/K}$ the manifold structure and the Riemannian metric such that $\pi$ is a Riemannian
submersion onto the symmetric space $G/K$. First we show that a simplicial decomposition of the
Riemannian manifold $\widehat{G/K}$ gives an irreducible topological Tits building of spherical
type and rank greater than two. By applying Burns-Spatzier's theorem to this topological Tits building,
we show that the Riemannian manifold $\widehat{G/K}$ is homothetic to the unit sphere. Furthermore,
from this fact, we show that $G/K$ is isometric to a sphere, a complex projective space or a quaternionic
projective space. This contradicts that $G/K$ is of rank greater than one. This is the recipi of our
proof. In the second-half part, we estimate the codimension of $M$ from above by using the multiplicities
of the roots of the root system of $G/K$. As its result, we can show that there exists no equifocal submanifold
with non-flat section in some irreducible simply connected symmetric spaces of compact type.

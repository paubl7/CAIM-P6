Parameters in climate models are usually calibrated manually, exploiting only small subsets of
the available data. This precludes both optimal calibration and quantification of uncertainties.
Traditional Bayesian calibration methods that allow uncertainty quantification are too expensive
for climate models; they are also not robust in the presence of internal climate variability. For
example, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods typically require $O(10^5)$ model runs and are
sensitive to internal variability noise, rendering them infeasible for climate models. Here we
demonstrate an approach to model calibration and uncertainty quantification that requires only
$O(10^2)$ model runs and can accommodate internal climate variability. The approach consists
of three stages: (i) a calibration stage uses variants of ensemble Kalman inversion to calibrate
a model by minimizing mismatches between model and data statistics; (ii) an emulation stage emulates
the parameter-to-data map with Gaussian processes (GP), using the model runs in the calibration
stage for training; (iii) a sampling stage approximates the Bayesian posterior distributions
by sampling the GP emulator with MCMC. We demonstrate the feasibility and computational efficiency
of this calibrate-emulate-sample (CES) approach in a perfect-model setting. Using an idealized
general circulation model, we estimate parameters in a simple convection scheme from synthetic
data generated with the model. The CES approach generates probability distributions of the parameters
that are good approximations of the Bayesian posteriors, at a fraction of the computational cost
usually required to obtain them. Sampling from this approximate posterior allows the generation
of climate predictions with quantified parametric uncertainties.

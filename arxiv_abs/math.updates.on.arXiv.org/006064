Let $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^3$ be an open set, we study the spectral properties of the free Dirac
operator $\mathcal{H}$ coupled with the singular potential $V_\kappa=(\epsilon I_4 +\mu\beta+\eta(\alpha\cdot
N))\delta_{\partial\Omega}$. In the first instance, $\Omega$ can be either a $\mathcal{C}^2$-bounded
domain or a locally deformed half-space. In both cases, the self-adjointness is proved and several
spectral properties are given. In particular, we give a complete description of the essential spectrum
of $\mathcal{H}+V_\kappa$ for the so-called critical combinations of coupling constants, when
$\Omega$ is a locally deformed half-space. In the second part of the paper, the case of bounded rough
domains is investigated. Namely, in the non-critical case and under the assumption that $\Omega$
has a VMO normal, we show that $\mathcal{H}+V_\kappa$ is still self-adjoint and preserves almost
all of its spectral properties. More generally, under certain assumptions about the sign or the
size of the coupling constants, we are able to show the self-adjointness of the coupling $\mathcal{H}+(\epsilon
I_4 +\mu\beta)\delta_{\partial\Omega}$, when $\Omega$ is bounded uniformly rectifiable. Moreover,
if $\epsilon^2-\mu^2=-4$, we then show that $\partial\Omega$ is impenetrable. In particular,
if $\Omega$ is Lipschitz, we then recover the same spectral properties as in the VMO case. In addition,
we establish a characterization of regular Semmes-Kenig-Toro domains via the compactness of the
anticommutator between $(\alpha\cdot\mathit{N})$ and the Cauchy operator associated to the
free Dirac operator. Finally, we study the coupling $\mathcal{H}_{\upsilon}=\mathcal{H}+i\upsilon\beta(\alpha\cdot
N)\delta_{\partial\Omega}$. In particular, if $\Omega$ is a bounded $\mathcal{C}^2$ domain,
then we show that $\mathcal{H}_{\pm2}$ is essentially self-adjoint and generates confinement.

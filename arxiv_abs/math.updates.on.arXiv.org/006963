Propagation characteristics of a wave are defined by the dispersion relationship, from which the
governing partial differential equation (PDE) can be recovered. PDEs are commonly solved numerically
using the finite-difference (FD) method, with stencils constructed from truncated Taylor series
expansions which, whilst typically providing good approximation of the PDE in the space-time domain,
often differ considerably from the original partial differential in the wavenumber-frequency
domain where the dispersion relationship is defined. Consequentially, stable, high-order FD
schemes may not necessarily result in realistic wave behavior, commonly exhibiting numerical
dispersion: lagging high-frequency components as a product of discretization. A method for optimizing
FD stencil weightings via constrained minimization to better approximate the partial derivative
in the wavenumber domain is proposed, allowing for accurate propagation with coarser grids than
would be otherwise possible. This was applied to second derivatives on a standard grid and first
derivatives on a staggered grid. To evaluate the efficacy of the method, a pair of numerical simulations
were devised to compare spatially-optimized stencils with conventional formulations of equivalent
extent. A spatially-optimized formulation of the 1D acoustic wave equation with Dirichlet boundary
conditions is presented, evaluating performance at a range of grid spacings, examining the interval
between the theoretical maximum grid spacings for the conventional and optimized schemes in finer
detail. The optimized scheme was found to offer superior performance for undersampled wavefields
and heavily oversampled wavefields. Staggered-grid first derivative stencils were then applied
to the P-SV elastic wave formulation, simulating seismic wave propagation for a two-layer, water-over-rock
model.

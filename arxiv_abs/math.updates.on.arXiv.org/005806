Departure time choice models play a crucial role in determining the traffic load in transportation
systems. This paper introduces a new framework to model and analyze the departure time user equilibrium
(DTUE) problem based on the so-called Mean Field Games (MFGs) theory. The proposed framework is
the combination of two main components including (i) the reaction of travelers to the traffic congestion
by choosing their departure times to optimize their travel cost; and (ii) the aggregation of the
actions of the travelers, which determines the congestion of the system. The first component corresponds
to a classic game theory model while the second one captures the travelers' interactions at the macroscopic
level and describes the system dynamics. In this paper, we first present a continuous departure
time choice model and investigate the equilibria of the system. Specifically, we demonstrate the
existence of the equilibrium and characterize the DTUE. Then, a discrete approximation of the system
is provided based on deterministic differential game models to numerically obtain the equilibrium
of the system. To examine the efficiency of the proposed model, we compare it with the departure time
choice models in the literature. We observe that the solution obtained based on our model is 5.6\%
closer to the optimal ones compared to the solutions determined based on models in the literature.
Moreover, our proposed model converges much faster with 87\% less number of iterations required
to converge. Finally, the model is applied to the real test case of Lyon Metropolis. The results show
that the proposed framework is capable of not only considering a large number of players but also
including multiple preferred travel times and heterogeneous trip lengths more accurately than
existing models in the literature.

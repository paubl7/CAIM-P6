For various 2-Calabi-Yau categories $\mathscr{C}$ for which the stack of objects $\mathfrak{M}$
has a good moduli space $p\colon\mathfrak{M}\rightarrow \mathcal{M}$, we establish purity of
the mixed Hodge module complex $p_{!}\underline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\mathfrak{M}}$. We do this by
using formality in 2CY categories, along with \'etale neighbourhood theorems for stacks, to prove
that the morphism $p$ is modelled \'etale-locally by the semisimplification morphism from the
stack of modules of a preprojective algebra. Then via the integrality theorem in cohomological
Donaldson-Thomas theory we prove purity of $p_{!}\underline{\mathbb{Q}}_{\mathfrak{M}}$.
It follows that the Beilinson-Bernstein-Deligne-Gabber decomposition theorem for the constant
sheaf holds for the morphism $p$, despite the possibly very singular and stacky nature of $\mathfrak{M}$.
We use this to define cuspidal cohomology for $\mathfrak{M}$, which is conjecturally a complete
space of generators for the BPS algebra associated to $\mathscr{C}$. We prove purity of the Borel--Moore
homology of the moduli stack $\mathfrak{M}$, provided its good moduli space $\mathcal{M}$ is projective,
or admits a suitable contracting $\mathbb{C}^*$-action. In particular, when $\mathfrak{M}$
is the moduli stack of Gieseker-semistable sheaves on a K3 surface, this proves a conjecture of Halpern-Leistner.
We use these results to moreover prove purity for several stacks of coherent sheaves that do not admit
a good moduli space. Without the usual assumption that $r$ and $d$ are coprime, we prove that the Borel-Moore
homology of the stack of semistable degree $d$ rank $r$ Higgs sheaves is pure and carries a perverse
filtration with respect to the Hitchin base, generalising the usual perverse filtration for the
Hitchin system to the case of singular stacks of Higgs sheaves.

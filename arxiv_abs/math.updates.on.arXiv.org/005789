The tunneling effect predicted by B.Josephson (Nobel Prize, 1973) concerns the Josephson junction:
two superconductors separated by a narrow dielectric. It states existence of a supercurrent through
it and equations governing it. The overdamped Josephson junction is modeled by a family of differential
equations on 2-torus depending on 3 parameters: $B$ (abscissa), $A$ (ordinate), $\omega$ (frequency).
We study its rotation number $\rho(B,A;\omega)$ as a function of $(B,A)$ with fixed $\omega$. The
phase-lock areas are the level sets $L_r:=\{\rho=r\}$ with non-empty interiors; they exist for
$r\in\mathbb Z$ (Buchstaber, Karpov, Tertychnyi). Each $L_r$ is an infinite chain of domains going
vertically to infinity and separated by points called constrictions (expect for those with $A=0$).
We show that: 1) all the constrictions in $L_r$ lie in its axis $\{ B=\omega r\}$ (confirming a conjecture
of Tertychnyi, Kleptsyn, Filimonov, Schurov); 2) each constriction is positive: some its punctured
neighborhood in the vertical line lies in $\operatorname{Int}(L_r)$ (confirming another conjecture).
We first prove deformability of each constriction to another one, with arbitrarily small $\omega$,
of the same $\rho$, $\ell:=\frac B\omega$ and type (positive or not), using equivalent description
of model by linear systems of differential equations on $\overline{\mathbb C}$ (Buchstaber, Karpov,
Tertychnyi) and studying their isomonodromic deformations described by Painlev\'e 3 equations.
Then non-existence of ghost constrictions (i.e., constrictions either with $\rho\neq\ell$,
or of non-positive type) with a given $\ell$ for small $\omega$ is proved by slow-fast methods. In
Section 6 we present applications of results and elaborated methods and open problems.

According to recent empirical studies, a majority of users have the same, or very similar, passwords
across multiple password-secured online services. This practice can have disastrous consequences,
as one password being compromised puts all the other accounts at much higher risk. Generally, an
adversary may use any side-information he/she possesses about the user, be it demographic information,
password reuse on a previously compromised account, or any other relevant information to devise
a better brute-force strategy (so called targeted attack). In this work, we consider a distributed
brute-force attack scenario in which $m$ adversaries, each observing some side information, attempt
breaching a password secured system. We compare two strategies: an uncoordinated attack in which
the adversaries query the system based on their own side-information until they find the correct
password, and a fully coordinated attack in which the adversaries pool their side-information
and query the system together. For passwords $\mathbf{X}$ of length $n$, generated independently
and identically from a distribution $P_X$, we establish an asymptotic closed-form expression
for the uncoordinated and coordinated strategies when the side-information $\mathbf{Y}_{(m)}$
are generated independently from passing $\mathbf{X}$ through a memoryless channel $P_{Y|X}$,
as the length of the password $n$ goes to infinity. We illustrate our results for binary symmetric
channels and binary erasure channels, two families of side-information channels which model password
reuse. We demonstrate that two coordinated agents perform asymptotically better than any finite
number of uncoordinated agents for these channels, meaning that sharing side-information is very
valuable in distributed attacks.

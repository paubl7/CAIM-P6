The rapid development of artificial intelligence together with the powerful computation capabilities
of the advanced edge servers make it possible to deploy learning tasks at the wireless network edge,
which is dubbed as edge intelligence (EI). The communication bottleneck between the data resource
and the server results in deteriorated learning performance as well as tremendous energy consumption.
To tackle this challenge, we explore a new paradigm called learning-and-energy-efficient (LEE)
EI, which simultaneously maximizes the learning accuracies and energy efficiencies of multiple
tasks via data partition and rate control. Mathematically, this results in a multi-objective optimization
problem. Moreover, the continuous varying rates over the whole transmission duration introduce
infinite variables. To solve this complex problem, we consider the case with infinite server buffer
capacity and one-shot data arrival at sensor. First, the number of variables are reduced to a finite
level by exploiting the optimality of constant-rate transmission in each epoch. Second, the optimal
solution is found by applying stratified sequencing or objectives merging. By assuming higher
priority of learning efficiency in stratified sequencing, the closed form of optimal data partition
is derived by the Lagrange method, while the optimal rate control is proved to have the structure
of directional water filling (DWF), based on which a string-pulling (SP) algorithm is proposed
to obtain the numerical values. The DWF structure of rate control is also proved to be optimal in objectives
merging via weighted summation. By exploiting the optimal rate changing properties, the SP algorithm
is further extended to account for the cases with limited server buffer capacity or bursty data arrival
at sensor. The performance of the proposed design is examined by extensive experiments based on
public datasets.

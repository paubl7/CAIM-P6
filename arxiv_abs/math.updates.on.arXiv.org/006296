High order accurate and explicit time-stable solvers are well suited for hyperbolic wave propagation
problems. As a result of the complexities of real geometries, internal interfaces and nonlinear
boundary and interface conditions, discontinuities and sharp wave fronts may become fundamental
features of the solution. Thus, geometrically flexible and adaptive numerical algorithms are
critical for high fidelity and efficient simulations of wave phenomena in many applications. Adaptive
curvilinear meshes hold promise to minimise the effort to represent complicated geometries or
heterogeneous material data avoiding the bottleneck of feature-preserving meshing. To enable
the design of stable DG methods on three space dimensional (3D) curvilinear elements we construct
a structure preserving anti-symmetric coordinate transformation motivated by the underlying
physics. Using a physics-based numerical penalty-flux, we develop a 3D provably energy-stable
discontinuous Galerkin finite element approximation of the elastic wave equation in geometrically
complex and heterogenous media. By construction, our numerical flux is upwind and yields a discrete
energy estimate analogous to the continuous energy estimate. The ability to treat conforming and
non-conforming curvilinear elements allows for flexible adaptive mesh refinement strategies.
The numerical scheme has been implemented in ExaHyPE, a simulation engine for parallel dynamically
adaptive simulations of wave problems on adaptive Cartesian meshes. We present 3D numerical experiments
of wave propagation in heterogeneous isotropic and anisotropic elastic solids demonstrating
stability and high order accuracy. We demonstrate the potential of our approach for computational
seismology in a regional wave propagation scenario in a geologically constrained 3D model including
the geometrically complex free-surface topography of Mount Zugspitze, Germany.

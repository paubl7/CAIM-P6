We develop data-driven algorithms for reachability analysis and control of systems with a priori
unknown nonlinear dynamics. The resulting algorithms not only are suitable for settings with real-time
requirements but also provide provable performance guarantees. To this end, they merge data from
only a single finite-horizon trajectory and, if available, various forms of side information.
Such side information may include knowledge of the regularity of the dynamics, algebraic constraints
on the states, monotonicity, or decoupling in the dynamics between the states. Specifically, we
develop two algorithms, $\texttt{DaTaReach}$ and $\texttt{DaTaControl}$, to over-approximate
the reachable set and design control signals for the system on the fly. $\texttt{DaTaReach}$ constructs
a differential inclusion that contains the unknown dynamics. Then, in a discrete-time setting,
it over-approximates the reachable set through interval Taylor-based methods applied to systems
with dynamics described as differential inclusions. We provide a bound on the time step size that
ensures the correctness and termination of $\texttt{DaTaReach}$. $\texttt{DaTaControl}$ enables
convex-optimization-based control using the computed over-approximation and the receding-horizon
control framework. Besides, $\texttt{DaTaControl}$ achieves near-optimal control and is suitable
for real-time control of such systems. We establish a bound on its suboptimality and the number of
primitive operations it requires to compute control values. Then, we theoretically show that $\texttt{DaTaControl}$
achieves tighter suboptimality bounds with an increasing amount of data and richer side information.
Finally, experiments on a unicycle, quadrotor, and aircraft systems demonstrate the efficacy
of both algorithms over existing approaches.

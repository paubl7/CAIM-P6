Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) detection is a fundamental problem in wireless communications
and it is strongly NP-hard in general. Massive MIMO has been recognized as a key technology in the
fifth generation (5G) and beyond communication networks, which on one hand can significantly improve
the communication performance, and on the other hand poses new challenges of solving the corresponding
optimization problems due to the large problem size. While various efficient algorithms such as
semidefinite relaxation (SDR) based approaches have been proposed for solving the small-scale
MIMO detection problem, they are not suitable to solve the large-scale MIMO detection problem due
to their high computational complexities. In this paper, we propose an efficient sparse quadratic
programming (SQP) relaxation based algorithm for solving the large-scale MIMO detection problem.
In particular, we first reformulate the MIMO detection problem as an SQP problem. By dropping the
sparse constraint, the resulting relaxation problem shares the same global minimizer with the
SQP problem. In sharp contrast to the SDRs for the MIMO detection problem, our relaxation does not
contain any (positive semidefinite) matrix variable and the numbers of variables and constraints
in our relaxation are significantly less than those in the SDRs, which makes it particularly suitable
for the large-scale problem. Then we propose a projected Newton based quadratic penalty method
to solve the relaxation problem, which is guaranteed to converge to the vector of transmitted signals
under reasonable conditions. By extensive numerical experiments, when applied to solve large-scale
problems, the proposed algorithm achieves better detection performance and is more robust to the
choice of the initial point than a recently proposed generalized power method.

We write $BV_h$ for the classifying space of the elementary Abelian 2-group $V_h$ of rank $h,$ which
is homotopy equivalent to the cartesian product of $h$ copies of $\mathbb RP^{\infty}.$ Its cohomology
with $\mathbb Z/2$-coefficients can be identified with the graded unstable algebra $P^{\otimes
h} = \mathbb Z/2[t_1, \ldots, t_h]= \bigoplus_{n\geq 0}P^{\otimes h}_n$ over the Steenrod ring
$\mathcal A$, where grading is by the degree of the homogeneous terms $P^{\otimes h}_n$ of degree
$n$ in $h$ generators with the degree of each $t_i$ being one. Let $GL_h$ be the usual general linear
group of rank $h$ over $\mathbb Z/2.$ The algebra $P^{\otimes h}$ admits a left action of $\mathcal
A$ as well as a right action of $GL_h.$ A central problem of homotopy theory is to determine the structure
of the space of $GL_h$-coinvariants, $\mathbb Z/2\otimes_{GL_h}{\rm Ann}_{\overline{\mathcal
A}}H_n(BV_h; \mathbb Z/2) ,$ where ${\rm Ann}_{\overline{\mathcal A}}H_n(BV_h; \mathbb Z/2)
={\rm Ann}_{\overline{\mathcal A}}[P^{\otimes h}_n]^{*}$ denotes the space of primitive homology
classes, considered as a representation of $GL_h$ for all $n.$ Solving this problem is very difficult
and still open for $h\geq 4.$ The aim of this work is of studying the dimension of $\mathbb Z/2\otimes_{GL_h}{\rm
Ann}_{\overline{\mathcal A}}[P^{\otimes h}_n]^{*}$ for the case $h = 4$ and the "generic" degrees
$n$ of the form $k(2^{s} - 1) + r.2^{s},$ where $k,\, r,\, s$ are positive integers. Applying the results,
we investigate the Singer cohomological "transfer" of rank $4$, which is a homomorphism from a certain
subquotient of the divided power algebra $\Gamma(a_1^{(1)}, \ldots, a_4^{(1)})$ to mod-2 cohomology
groups ${\rm Ext}_{\mathcal A}^{4, 4+n}(\mathbb Z/2, \mathbb Z/2)$ of the algebra $\mathcal A.$

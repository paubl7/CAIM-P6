Let $A$ be a set of finite integers, define $$A+A \ = \ \{a_1+a_2: a_1,a_2 \in A\}, \ \ \ A-A \ = \ \{a_1-a_2:
a_1,a_2 \in A\},$$ and for non-negative integers $s$ and $d$ define $$sA-dA\ =\ \underbrace{A+\cdots+A}_{s}
-\underbrace{A-\cdots-A}_{d}.$$ A More Sums than Differences (MSTD) set is an $A$ where $|A+A|
> |A-A|$. It was initially thought that the percentage of subsets of $[0,n]$ that are MSTD would go
to zero as $n$ approaches infinity as addition is commutative and subtraction is not. However, in
a surprising 2006 result, Martin and O'Bryant proved that a positive percentage of sets are MSTD,
although this percentage is extremely small, about $10^{-4}$ percent. This result was extended
by Iyer, Lazarev, Miller, ans Zhang [ILMZ] who showed that a positive percentage of sets are generalized
MSTD sets, sets for $\{s_1,d_1\} \neq \{s_2, d_2\}$ and $s_1+d_1=s_2+d_2$ with $|s_1A-d_1A| >
|s_2A-d_2A|$, and that in $d$-dimensions, a positive percentage of sets are MSTD. For many such
results, establishing explicit MSTD sets in $1$-dimensions relies on the specific choice of the
elements on the left and right fringes of the set to force certain differences to be missed while desired
sums are attained. In higher dimensions, the geometry forces a more careful assessment of what elements
have the same behavior as $1$-dimensional fringe elements. We study fringes in $d$-dimensions
and use these to create new explicit constructions. We prove the existence of generalized MSTD sets
in $d$-dimensions and the existence of $k$-generational sets, which are sets where $|cA+cA|>|cA-cA|$
for all $1\leq c \leq k$. We then prove that under certain conditions, there are no sets with $|kA+kA|>|kA-kA|$
for all $k \in \mathbb{N}.$

We present a numerical method for computing the evolution of a planar, star-shaped curve under a
broad class of curvature-driven geometric flows, which we refer to as the Andrews-Bloore flows.
This family of flows has two parameters that control one constant and one curvature-dependent component
for the velocity in the direction of the normal to the curve. The Andrews-Bloore flow includes as
special cases the well known Eikonal, curve-shortening and affine shortening flows, and for positive
parameter values its evolution shrinks the area enclosed by the curve to zero in finite time. A question
of key interest has been how the shape itself, as well as various shape descriptors evolve as this
limit is approached. Star-like curves can be represented by a periodic scalar polar distance function
$r(\varphi)$ measured from a reference point. An important question is how the numbers and the trajectories
of critical points of the distance function $r(\varphi)$ and of the curvature $\kappa(\varphi)$
evolve under the Andrews-Bloore flows for different choices of the parameters. Our method is specifically
designed to meet the challenge of computing accurate trajectories of these critical points up to
the vicinity of a limiting shape. Each curve is represented by a piecewise polynomial periodic distance
function, as determined by a chosen mesh; different types of meshes and mesh adaptation can be chosen
to ensure a good balance between accuracy and computational cost. As we demonstrate with benchmark
tests and two longer case studies, our method allows one to perform numerical investigations into
subtle questions of planar curve evolution. More specifically we provide illustrations of some
known results, numerical evidence for two stated conjectures, as well as new insights and observations
regarding the limit shapes of initial curves with different types of symmetry.

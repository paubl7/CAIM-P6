Despite the increased computational resources, the simulation-based design optimization (SBDO)
procedure can be very expensive from a computational viewpoint, especially if high-fidelity solvers
are required. Multi-fidelity metamodels have been successfully applied to reduce the computational
cost of the SBDO process. In this context, the paper presents the performance assessment of an adaptive
multi-fidelity metamodel based on a Gaussian process regression (MF-GPR) for noisy data. The MF-GPR
is developed to: (i) manage an arbitrary number of fidelity levels, (ii) deal with objective function
evaluations affected by noise, and (iii) improve its fitting accuracy by adaptive sampling. Multi-fidelity
is achieved by bridging a low-fidelity metamodel with metamodels of the error between successive
fidelity levels. The MF-GPR handles the numerical noise through regression. The adaptive sampling
method is based on the maximum prediction uncertainty and includes rules to automatically select
the fidelity to sample. The MF-GPR performance are assessed on a set of five analytical benchmark
problems affected by noisy objective function evaluations. Since the noise introduces randomness
in the evaluation of the objective function, a statistical analysis approach is adopted to assess
the performance and the robustness of the MF-GPR. The paper discusses the efficiency and effectiveness
of the MF-GPR in globally approximating the objective function and identifying the global minimum.
One, two, and three fidelity levels are used. The results of the statistical analysis show that the
use of three fidelity levels achieves a more accurate global representation of the noise-free objective
function compared to the use of one or two fidelities.

The article is a study of two algebraic structures, the `contrapositionally complemented pseudo-Boolean
algebra' (ccpBa) and `contrapositionally $\vee$ complemented pseudo-Boolean algebra' (c$\vee$cpBa).
The algebras have recently been obtained from a topos-theoretic study of categories of rough sets.
The salient feature of these algebras is that there are two negations, one intuitionistic and another
minimal in nature, along with a condition connecting the two operators. We study properties of these
algebras, give examples, and compare them with relevant existing algebras. `Intuitionistic Logic
with Minimal Negation (ILM)' corresponding to ccpBas and its extension ILM-${\vee}$ for c$\vee$cpBas,
are then investigated. Besides its relations with intuitionistic and minimal logics, ILM is observed
to be related to Peirce's logic. With a focus on properties of the two negations, two kinds of relational
semantics for ILM and ILM-${\vee}$ are obtained, and an inter-translation between the two semantics
is provided. Extracting features of the two negations in the algebras, a further investigation
is made, following logical studies of negations that define the operators independently of the
binary operator of implication. Using Dunn's logical framework for the purpose, two logics $K_{im}$
and $K_{im-{\vee}}$ are presented, where the language does not include implication. $K_{im}$-algebras
are reducts of ccpBas. The negations in the algebras are shown to occupy distinct positions in an
enhanced form of Dunn's Kite of negations. Relational semantics for $K_{im}$ and $K_{im-{\vee}}$
are given, based on Dunn's compatibility frames. Finally, relationships are established between
the different algebraic and relational semantics for the logics defined in the work.

Major advances in public health have resulted from disease prevention. However, prevention of
a new infectious disease by vaccination or pharmaceuticals is made difficult by the slow process
of vaccine and drug development. We propose an additional intervention that allows rapid control
of emerging infectious diseases, and can also be used to eradicate diseases that rely almost exclusively
on human-to-human transmission. The intervention is based on (1) testing every individual for
the disease, (2) repeatedly, and (3) isolation of infected individuals. We show here that at a sufficient
rate of testing, the reproduction number is reduced below 1.0 and the epidemic will rapidly collapse.
The approach does not rely on strong or unrealistic assumptions about test accuracy, isolation
compliance, population structure or epidemiological parameters, and its success can be monitored
in real time by following the test positivity rate. In addition to the compliance rate and false negatives,
the required rate of testing depends on the design of the testing regime, with concurrent testing
outperforming random sampling. Provided that results are obtained rapidly, the test frequency
required to suppress an epidemic is monotonic and near-linear with respect to R0, the infectious
period, and the fraction of susceptible individuals. The testing regime is effective against both
early phase and established epidemics, and additive to other interventions (e.g. contact tracing
and social distancing). It is also robust to failure: any rate of testing reduces the number of infections,
improving both public health and economic conditions. These conclusions are based on rigorous
analysis and simulations of appropriate epidemiological models. A mass-produced, disposable
test that could be used at home would be ideal, due to the optimal performance of concurrent tests
that return immediate results.

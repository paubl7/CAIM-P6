In this paper, we continue the study of boundedness questions for (simply connected) smooth Calabi-Yau
threefolds commenced in arXiv:1706.01268. The diffeomorphism class of such a threefold is known
to be determined up to finitely many possibilities by the integral middle cohomology and two integral
forms on the integral second cohomology, namely the cubic cup-product form and the linear form given
by cup-product with the second chern class. The question addressed in both papers is whether knowledge
of these cubic and linear forms determines the threefold up to finitely many families, that is the
moduli of such threefolds is bounded. If this is true, then in particular the middle integral cohomology
would be bounded by knowing these two forms. Crucial to this question is the study of rigid non-movable
surfaces on the threefold, which are the irreducible surfaces that deform with any small deformation
of the complex structure of the threefold but for which no multiple moves on the threefold. We showed
in the previous paper that if there are no such surfaces, then the answer to the above question is yes.
Moreover if the Picard number is 2, the answer was shown to be yes without any further assumptions
on the Calabi-Yau threefold. The main results of this paper are for Picard number 3, where we prove
birational boundedness in the case where there is at most one rigid non-movable surface, assuming
the cubic form is smooth (thereby defining a real elliptic curve) and the line defined by the second
chern class does not intersect this curve in a rational point. In addition to the methods described
in the previous paper, further crucial tools in the proofs will be the classical Steinian involution
on the Hessian of an elliptic curve and Siegel's theorem concerning integral points on an affine
integral curve.

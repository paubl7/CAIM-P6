Helly's theorem and its variants show that for a family of convex sets in Euclidean space, local intersection
patterns influence global intersection patterns. A classical result of Eckhoff in 1988 provided
an optimal fractional Helly theorem for axis-aligned boxes, which are Cartesian products of line
segments. Answering a question raised by B\'ar\'any and Kalai, and independently Lew, we generalize
Eckhoff's result to Cartesian products of convex sets in all dimensions. In particular, we prove
that given $\alpha \in (1-\frac{1}{t^d},1]$ and a finite family $\mathcal{F}$ of Cartesian products
of convex sets $\prod_{i\in[t]}A_i$ in $\mathbb{R}^{td}$ with $A_i\subset \mathbb{R}^d$ if
at least $\alpha$-fraction of the $(d+1)$-tuples in $\mathcal{F}$ are intersecting then at least
$(1-(t^d(1-\alpha))^{1/(d+1)})$-fraction of sets in $\mathcal{F}$ are intersecting. This
is a special case of a more general result on intersections of $d$-Leray complexes. We also provide
a construction showing that our result on $d$-Leray complexes is optimal. Interestingly the extremal
example is representable as a family of cartesian products of convex sets, implying the bound $\alpha>1-\frac{1}{t^d}$
and the fraction $(1-(t^d(1-\alpha))^{1/(d+1)})$ above are also best possible. The well-known
optimal construction for fractional Helly theorem for convex sets in $\mathbb{R}^d$ does not have
$(p,d+1)$-condition for sublinear $p$. Inspired by this we give constructions showing that, somewhat
surprisingly, imposing additional $(p,d+1)$-condition has negligible effect on improving the
quantitative bounds in neither the fractional Helly theorem for convex sets nor Cartesian products
of convex sets. Our constructions offer a rich family of distinct extremal configurations for fractional
Helly theorem, implying in a sense that the optimal bound is stable.

A framework for coherent pattern extraction and prediction of observables of measure-preserving,
ergodic dynamical systems with both atomic and continuous spectral components is developed. It
is based on an approximation of the generator of the system by a compact operator $W_\tau$ on a reproducing
kernel Hilbert space (RKHS). A key tool is that $W_\tau$ is skew-adjoint , and thus can be characterized
by a unique projection-valued measure, discrete by compactness, and an associated orthonormal
basis of eigenfunctions. These eigenfunctions can be ordered in terms of a Dirichlet energy on the
RKHS, and provide a notion of coherent observables under the dynamics akin to the Koopman eigenfunctions
associated with the atomic part of the spectrum. In addition, the regularized generator has a well-defined
Borel functional calculus allowing the construction of a unitary evolution group $\{ e^{t W_\tau}
\}_{t\in\mathbb{R}}$ on the RKHS, which approximates the unitary Koopman evolution group of the
original system. We establish convergence results for the spectrum and Borel functional calculus
of the regularized generator to those of the original system in the limit $\tau \to 0^+$. Convergence
results are also established for a data-driven formulation, where these operators are approximated
using finite-rank operators obtained from observed time series. An advantage of working with an
RKHS structure is that one can perform pointwise evaluation and interpolation through bounded
linear operators, which is not possible in $L^p$ spaces. This enables the out of sample evaluation
of data-approximated eigenfunctions, as well as data-driven forecasts initialized with pointwise
initial data (as opposed to probability densities in $L^p$). The pattern extraction and prediction
framework is numerically applied to three instances of ergodic dynamical systems with atomic and
continuous spectra.

The Markowitz-based portfolio selection turns to an NP-hard problem when considering cardinality
constraints. In this case, existing exact solutions like quadratic programming may not be efficient
to solve the problem. Many researchers, therefore, used heuristic and metaheuristic approaches
in order to deal with the problem. This work presents Asexual Reproduction Optimization (ARO),
a model free metaheuristic algorithm inspired by the asexual reproduction, in order to solve the
portfolio optimization problem including cardinality constraint to ensure the investment in
a given number of different assets and bounding constraint to limit the proportions of fund invested
in each asset. This is the first time that this relatively new metaheuristic is in the field of portfolio
optimization, and we show that ARO results in better quality solutions in comparison with some of
the well-known metaheuristics stated in the literature. To validate our proposed algorithm, we
measured the deviation of obtained results from the standard efficient frontier. We report our
computational results on a set of publicly available benchmark test problems relating to five main
market indices containing 31, 85, 89, 98, and 225 assets. These results are used in order to test the
efficiency of our proposed method in comparison to other existing metaheuristic solutions. The
experimental results indicate that ARO outperforms Genetic Algorithm(GA), Tabu Search (TS),
Simulated Annealing (SA), and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) in most of test problems. In terms
of the obtained error, by using ARO, the average error of the aforementioned test problems is reduced
by approximately 20 percent of the minimum average error calculated for the above-mentioned algorithms.

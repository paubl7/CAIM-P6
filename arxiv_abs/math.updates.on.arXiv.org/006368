A new four-parameters family of constitutive functions for spherically symmetric elastic bodies
is introduced which extends the two-parameters class of polytropic fluid models widely used in
several applications of fluid mechanics. The four parameters in the polytropic elastic model are
the polytropic exponent $\gamma$, the bulk modulus $\kappa$, the shear exponent $\beta$ and the
Poisson ratio $\nu\in (-1,1/2]$. The two-parameters class of polytropic fluid models arises as
a special case when $\nu=1/2$ and $\beta=\gamma$. In contrast to the standard Lagrangian approach
in elasticity theory, the polytropic elastic model in this paper is formulated directly in physical
space, i.e., in terms of Eulerian state variables, which is particularly useful for the applications
e.g. to astrophysics where the reference state of the bodies of interest (stars, planets, etc.)
is not observable. After discussing some general properties of the polytropic elastic model, the
steady states and the homologous motion of Newtonian self-gravitating polytropic elastic balls
are investigated. It is shown numerically that static balls exist when the parameters $\gamma,\beta$
are contained in a particular region $\mathcal{O}$ of the plane, depending on $\nu$, and proved
analytically for $(\gamma,\beta)\in\mathcal{V}$, where $\mathcal{V}\subset\mathcal{O}$
is a disconnected set which also depends on the Poisson ratio $\nu$. Homologous solutions describing
continuously collapsing balls are constructed numerically when $\gamma=4/3$. The radius of these
solutions shrinks to zero in finite time, causing the formation of a center singularity with infinite
density and pressure. Expanding self-gravitating homologous elastic balls are also constructed
analytically for some special values of the shear parameter $\beta$.

Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology for achieving
high spectrum and energy efficiency in future wireless communication networks. In this paper,
we investigate an RIS-aided single-cell multi-user mobile edge computing (MEC) system where an
RIS is deployed to support the communication between a base station (BS) equipped with MEC servers
and multiple single-antenna users. To utilize the scarce frequency resource efficiently, we assume
that users communicate with BS based on a non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) protocol. Each
user has a computation task which can be computed locally or partially/fully offloaded to the BS.
We aim to minimize the sum energy consumption of all users by jointly optimizing the passive phase
shifters, the size of transmission data, transmission rate, power control, transmission time
and the decoding order. Since the resulting problem is non-convex, we use the block coordinate descent
method to alternately optimize two separated subproblems. More specifically, we use the dual method
to tackle a subproblem with given phase shift and obtain the closed-form solution; and then we utilize
penalty method to solve another subproblem for given power control. Moreover, in order to demonstrate
the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm, we propose three benchmark schemes: the time-division
multiple access (TDMA)-MEC scheme, the full local computing scheme and the full offloading scheme.
We use an alternating 1-D search method and the dual method that can solve the TDMA-based transmission
problem well. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can increase the energy efficiency
and achieve significant performance gains over the three benchmark schemes.

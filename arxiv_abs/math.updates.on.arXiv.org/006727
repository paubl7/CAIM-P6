In this thesis, we discuss some of the applications of cosmological perturbation theory in the late
universe. We begin by reviewing the tools used to understand the standard model of cosmology theoretically
and to compute its observational consequences, including a detailed exposition of cosmological
perturbation theory. We then describe the results in this thesis; we present novel analytical solutions
for linear-order gravitational waves or tensor perturbations in a flat Friedmann-Robertson-Walker
universe containing two perfect fluids -- radiation and pressureless dust -- and allowing for neutrino
anisotropic stress. One of the results applies to any sub-horizon gravitational wave in such a universe.
Another result applies to gravitational waves of primordial origin (for example, produced during
inflation) and works both before and after they cross the horizon. These results improve on analytical
approximations previously set out in the literature. Comparison with numerical solutions shows
that both these approximations are accurate to within 1% or better, for a wide range of wave-numbers
relevant for cosmology. We present a new and independent approach to computing the relativistic
galaxy number counts to second order in cosmological perturbation theory. We also derive analytical
expressions for the full second-order relativistic observed redshift, for the angular diameter
distance and the volume spanned by a survey. We then compare our result with previous works which
compute the general distance-redshift relation, finding that our result is in agreement at linear
and leading nonlinear order. Lastly, we briefly study a class of almost scale-invariant Gauss-Bonnet
modified gravity theory and derive the Einstein-like field equations to first order in cosmological
perturbation theory in longitudinal gauge.

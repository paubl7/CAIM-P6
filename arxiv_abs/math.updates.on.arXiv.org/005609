In this paper we show how a second order scalar uniformly elliptic equation on divergence form with
measurable coefficients and Dirichlet boundary conditions can be transformed into a first order
elliptic system with half-Dirichlet boundary condition. This first order system involves Hodge-Dirac
operators and can be seen as a natural generalization of the Beltrami equation in the plane and we
develop a theory for this equation, extending results from the plane to higher dimension. The reduction
to a first order system applies both to linear as well as quasilinear second order equations and we
believe this to be of independent interest. Using the first order system, we give a new representation
formula of the solution of the Dirichlet problem both on simply and finitely connected domains.
This representation formula involves only singular integral operators of convolution type and
Neumann series there of, for which classical Calder\'on-Zygmund theory is applicable. Moreover,
no use is made of any fundamental solution or Green's function beside fundamental solutions of constant
coefficient operators. Remarkably, this representation formula applies also for solutions of
the fully non-linear first order system. To the best of the authors knowledge this is the first general
representation formula for solution of nonlinear boundary value problem ever. We hope that the
representation formula could be used for numerically solving the equations. Using these tools
we give a new short proof of Meyers' higher integrability theorem. Furthermore, we show that the
solutions of the first order system are H\"older continuous with the same H\"older coefficient
as the solutions of the second order equations. Finally, factorization identities and representation
formulas for the higher dimensional Beurling-Ahlfors operator are proven.

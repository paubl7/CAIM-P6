Conventional sparse phase retrieval schemes can recover sparse signals from the magnitude of linear
measurements only up to a global phase ambiguity. This work proposes a novel approach that instead
utilizes the magnitude of affine measurements to achieve ambiguity-free signal reconstruction.
The proposed method relies on two-stage approach that consists of support identification followed
by the exact recovery of nonzero signal entries. In the noise-free case, perfect support identification
using a simple counting rule is guaranteed subject to a mild condition on the signal sparsity, and
subsequent exact recovery of the nonzero signal entries can be obtained in closed-form. The proposed
approach is then extended to two noisy scenarios, namely, sparse noise (or outliers) and non-sparse
bounded noise. For both cases, perfect support identification is still ensured under mild conditions
on the noise model, namely, the support size for sparse outliers and the power of the bounded noise.
Under perfect support identification, exact signal recovery can be achieved using a simple majority
rule for the sparse noise scenario, and reconstruction up to a bounded error can be achieved using
linear least-squares (LS) estimation for the non-sparse bounded noise scenario. The obtained
analytic performance guarantee for the latter case also sheds light on the construction of the sensing
matrix and bias vector. In fact, we show that a near optimal performance can be achieved with high
probability by the random generation of the nonzero entries of the sparse sensing matrix and bias
vector according to the uniform distribution over a circle. Computer simulations using both synthetic
and real-world data sets are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

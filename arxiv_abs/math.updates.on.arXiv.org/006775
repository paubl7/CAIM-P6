In 2015, Mantoulidis and Schoen constructed $3$-dimensional asymptotically Euclidean manifolds
with non-negative scalar curvature whose ADM mass can be made arbitrarily close to the optimal value
of the Riemannian Penrose Inequality, while the intrinsic geometry of the outermost minimal surface
can be "far away" from being round. The resulting manifolds, called \emph{extensions}, are geometrically
not "close" to a spatial Schwarzschild manifold. This suggests instability of the Riemannian Penrose
Inequality. Their construction was later adapted to $n+1$ dimensions by Cabrera Pacheco and Miao,
suggesting instability of the higher dimensional Riemannian Penrose Inequality. In recent papers
by Alaee, Cabrera Pacheco, and Cederbaum and by Cabrera Pacheco, Cederbaum, and McCormick, a similar
construction was performed for asymptotically Euclidean, electrically charged Riemannian manifolds
and for asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian manifolds, respectively, obtaining $3$-dimensional
extensions that suggest instability of the Riemannian Penrose Inequality with electric charge
and of the conjectured asymptotically hyperbolic Riemannian Penrose Inequality in $3$ dimensions.
This paper combines and generalizes all the aforementioned results by constructing suitable asymptotically
hyperbolic or asymptotically Euclidean extensions with electric charge in $n+1$ dimensions for
$n\geq2$. Besides suggesting instability of a naturally conjecturally generalized Riemannian
Penrose Inequality, the constructed extensions give insights into an ad hoc generalized notion
of Bartnik mass, similar to the Bartnik mass estimate for minimal surfaces proven by Mantoulidis
and Schoen via their extensions, and unifying the Bartnik mass estimates in the various scenarios
mentioned above.

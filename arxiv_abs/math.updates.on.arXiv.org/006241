We present a deep reinforcement learning-based artificial intelligence agent that could provide
optimized development plans given a basic description of the reservoir and rock/fluid properties
with minimal computational cost. This artificial intelligence agent, comprising of a convolutional
neural network, provides a mapping from a given state of the reservoir model, constraints, and economic
condition to the optimal decision (drill/do not drill and well location) to be taken in the next stage
of the defined sequential field development planning process. The state of the reservoir model
is defined using parameters that appear in the governing equations of the two-phase flow. A feedback
loop training process referred to as deep reinforcement learning is used to train an artificial
intelligence agent with such a capability. The training entails millions of flow simulations with
varying reservoir model descriptions (structural, rock and fluid properties), operational constraints,
and economic conditions. The parameters that define the reservoir model, operational constraints,
and economic conditions are randomly sampled from a defined range of applicability. Several algorithmic
treatments are introduced to enhance the training of the artificial intelligence agent. After
appropriate training, the artificial intelligence agent provides an optimized field development
plan instantly for new scenarios within the defined range of applicability. This approach has advantages
over traditional optimization algorithms (e.g., particle swarm optimization, genetic algorithm)
that are generally used to find a solution for a specific field development scenario and typically
not generalizable to different scenarios.

This work contains three papers: the first entitled - An Eulerian proof of Fermat's last theorem
- presents a marvellous proof through the so-called discordant forms of appropriate Euler's double
equations, which could have entered in a not very narrow margin, i.e. in only a few pages (less than
13). The second instead, entitled - Some Diophantus-Fermat double equations equivalent to Frey's
elliptic curve - provides the possible proof, which Fermat has not published in detail, but which
uses the characteristic of all right-angled triangles with sides equal to whole numbers, or the
famous Pythagorean identity (the pages are less than 9). The third work entitled - A laboratory for
the rediscovery of Fermat's lost proof, is what allowed the independent production of the first
two paper. Obviously, being very general, it can be considered in continuous working, but there
is no doubt that a careful reading of it is necessary if you want to understand how two different proofs
of Fermat's Last Theorem are possible. This last paper provides a proof, which is not elementary
(25 pages): It is in various ways articulated and sometimes the author use facts with are proven later,
but it is still addressed in an appropriate manner. Also this proof is however conditioned by presence
of a right triangle (very often used by Fermat in his elusive digressions on natural numbers) or more
precisely from a Pythagorean equation, which has a role decisive in the reconstruction of the lost
proof. I report that the Journal of Analysis and Number Theory has made in part (5 pages). this paper

and indexed by Scopus, able to review and accept one of the two papers indicated at the beginning or
even both !!!

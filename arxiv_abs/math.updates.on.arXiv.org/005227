Chemotaxis is a fundamental mechanism of cells and organisms, which is responsible for attracting
microbes to food, embryonic cells into developing tissues, or immune cells to infection sites.
Mathematically chemotaxis is described by the Patlak--Keller--Segel model. This macroscopic
system of equations is derived from the microscopic model when limiting behaviour is studied. However,
on taking the limit and passing from the microscopic equations to the macroscopic equations, fluctuations
are neglected. Perturbing the system by a Gaussian random field restitutes the inherent randomness
of the system. This gives us the motivation to study the classical Patlak--Keller--Segel system
perturbed by random processes. We study a stochastic version of the classical Patlak--Keller--Segel
system under homogeneous Neumann boundary conditions on an interval $\mathcal{O}=[0,1]$. In
particular, let $\mathcal{W}_1$, $\mathcal{W}_2$ be two time-homogeneous spatial Wiener processes
over a filtered probability space $\mathfrak{A}$. Let $u$ and $v$ denote the cell density and concentration
of the chemical signal. We investigate the coupled system \begin{align*} & d {u} - ( r_u\Delta u-
\chi {\rm div }( u\nabla v) )\, dt =u\circ d\mathcal{W}_1, \\ & d{v} -(r_v \Delta v -\alpha v)\, dt
= \beta u \, dt+ v\circ d\mathcal{W}_2, \end{align*} with initial conditions $(u(0),v(0))=(u_0,v_0)$.
The positive terms $r_u$ and $r_v$ are the diffusivity of the cells and chemoattractant, respectively,
the positive value $\chi$ is the chemotactic sensitivity, $\alpha\ge0$ is the so-called damping
constant. The noise is interpreted in the Stratonovich sense. Given $T>0$, we will prove the existence
of a martingale solution on $[0,T]$.

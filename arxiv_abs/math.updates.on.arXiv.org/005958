Let f(1)=2, f(2)=4, and let f(n+1)=f(n)! for every integer n>1. E. Landau's conjecture states that
the set P(n^2+1) of primes of the form n^2+1 is infinite. This conjecture implies the following unproven
statement \Phi: card(P(n^2+1))<\omega => P(n^2+1) \subseteq [2,f(7)]. Let B denote the system
of equations: {x_i!=x_k: i,k \in {1,...,9}} \cup {x_i \cdot x_j=x_k: i,j,k \in {1,...,9}}. We write
down a system U \subseteq B of 9 equations which has exactly two solutions in positive integers x_1,...,x_9:
(1,...,1) and (f(1),...,f(9)). Let \Psi denote the statement: if a system S \subseteq B has at most
finitely many solutions in positive integers x_1,...,x_9, then each such solution (x_1,...,x_9)
satisfies x_1,...,x_9 \leq f(9). We write down a system A \subseteq B of 8 equations. The statement
\Psi restricted to the system A is equivalent to the statement \Phi. It heuristically proves the
statement \Phi. This proof does not yield that card(P(n^2+1))=\omega. Conditions (1)-(5) concern
sets X \subseteq N. *** (1) There are many elements of X and it is conjectured that X is infinite. (2)
No known algorithm with no input returns the logical value of the statement card(X)=\omega. (3)
A known algorithm for every k \in N decides whether or not k \in X. (4) A known algorithm with no input
returns an integer n satisfying card(X)<\omega => X \subseteq (-\infty,n]. (5) There is a known
formula \phi(x) of Peano arithmetic such that for all except at most finitely many k \in N, \phi(k)<=>
k \in X. The simplest known such formula \phi(x) satisfies {k \in N: \phi(k)}=X. *** We define a set
X \subseteq N that satisfies conditions (1)-(5). No set X \subseteq N will satisfy conditions (1)-(4)
forever, if for every algorithm with no input, at some future day, a computer will be able to execute
this algorithm in 1 second or less. The statement \Phi implies that conditions (1)-(5) hold for X={1}
\cup P(n^2+1).

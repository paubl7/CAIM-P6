Three-dimensional geophysical fluids support both internal and boundary-trapped waves. To obtain
the normal modes in such fluids we must solve a differential eigenvalue problem for the vertical
structure (for simplicity, we only consider horizontally periodic domains). If the boundaries
are dynamically inert (e.g., rigid boundaries in the Boussinesq internal wave problem, flat boundaries
in the quasigeostrophic Rossby wave problem) the resulting eigenvalue problem typically has a
Sturm-Liouville form and the properties of such problems are well-known. However, when restoring
forces are also present at the boundaries, then the equations of motion contain a time-derivative
in the boundary conditions and this leads to an eigenvalue problem where the eigenvalue correspondingly
appears in the boundary conditions. This article develops the theory of such problems and explores
the properties of wave problems with dynamically-active boundaries. The theory allows us to solve
the initial value problem for quasigeostrophic Rossby waves in a region with sloping bottom (we
also apply the theory to two Boussinesq problems with a free-surface). For a step-function perturbation
at a dynamically-active boundary, we find that the resulting time-evolution consists of waves
present in proportion to their projection onto the dynamically-active boundary. If one boundary
is dynamically-active, the modes form a basis, not of $L^2$, but rather of the larger space $L^2\oplus
\mathbb{C}$. The eigenfunctions also have the following properties: several linearly independent
eigenfunctions may have an identical number of internal zeros, they satisfy an indefinite orthogonality
relation involving boundary contributions, and they may have jump discontinuities at the boundaries.

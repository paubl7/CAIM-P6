Prediction models are often employed in estimating parameters of optimization models. Despite
the fact that in an end-to-end view, the real goal is to achieve good optimization performance, the
prediction performance is measured on its own. While it is usually believed that good prediction
performance in estimating the parameters will result in good subsequent optimization performance,
formal theoretical guarantees on this are notably lacking. In this paper, we explore conditions
that allow us to explicitly describe how the prediction performance governs the optimization performance.
Our weaker condition allows for an asymptotic convergence result, while our stronger condition
allows for exact quantification of the optimization performance in terms of the prediction performance.
In general, verification of these conditions is a non-trivial task. Nevertheless, we show that
our weaker condition is equivalent to the well-known Fisher consistency concept from the learning
theory literature. This then allows us to easily check our weaker condition for several loss functions.
We also establish that the squared error loss function satisfies our stronger condition. Consequently,
we derive the exact theoretical relationship between prediction performance measured with the
squared loss, as well as a class of symmetric loss functions, and the subsequent optimization performance.
In a computational study on portfolio optimization, fractional knapsack and multiclass classification
problems, we compare the optimization performance of using of several prediction loss functions
(some that are Fisher consistent and some that are not) and demonstrate that lack of consistency
of the loss function can indeed have a detrimental effect on performance.

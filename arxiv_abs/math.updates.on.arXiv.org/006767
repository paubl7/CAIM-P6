Random normed modules ($RN$ modules) are a random generalization of ordinary normed spaces, which
are usually endowed with the two kinds of topologies -- the $(\varepsilon,\lambda)$-topology
and the locally $L^0$-convex topology. The purpose of this paper is to give a noncompact generalization
of the classical Schauder fixed point theorem for the development and financial applications of
$RN$ modules. Motivated by the randomized version of the classical Bolzano-Weierstrauss theorem,
we first introduce the two notions of a random sequentially compact set and a random sequentially
continuous mapping under the $(\varepsilon,\lambda)$-topology and further establish their
corresponding characterizations under the locally $L^0$-convex topology so that we can treat
the fixed point problems under the two kinds of topologies in an unified way. Then we prove our desired
Schauder fixed point theorem that in a $\sigma$-stable $RN$ module every continuous (under either
topology) $\sigma$-stable mapping $T$ from a random sequentially compact closed $L^0$-convex
subset $G$ to $G$ has a fixed point. The whole idea to prove the fixed point theorem is to find an approximate
fixed point of $T$, but, since $G$ is not compact in general, realizing such an idea in the random setting
forces us to construct the corresponding Schauder projection in a subtle way and carry out countably
many decompositions for $T$ so that we can first obtain an approximate fixed point for each decomposition
and eventually one for $T$ by the countable concatenation skill. Besides, the new fixed point theorem
not only includes as a special case Bharucha-Reid and Mukherjea's famous random version of the classical
Schauder fixed point theorem but also implies the corresponding Krasnoselskii fixed point theorem
in $RN$ modules.

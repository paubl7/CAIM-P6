We study nonlinear pantograph-type reaction-diffusion PDEs, which, in addition to the unknown
$u=u(x,t)$, also contain the same functions with dilated or contracted arguments of the form $w=u(px,t)$,
$w=u(x,qt)$, and $w=u(px,qt)$, where $p$ and $q$ are the free scaling parameters (for equations
with proportional delay we have $0<p<1$, $0<q<1$). A brief review of publications on pantograph-type
ODEs and PDEs and their applications is given. Exact solutions and reductions of various types of
such nonlinear partial functional differential equations are described for the first time. We
present examples of nonlinear pantograph-type PDEs with proportional delay, which admit traveling-wave
and self-similar solutions (note that PDEs with constant delay do not have self-similar solutions).
Additive, multiplicative and functional separable solutions, as well as some other exact solutions
are also obtained. Special attention is paid to nonlinear pantograph-type PDEs of a rather general
form, which contain one or two arbitrary functions. In total, more than forty nonlinear pantograph-type
reaction-diffusion PDEs with dilated or contracted arguments, admitting exact solutions, have
been considered. Multi-pantograph nonlinear PDEs are also discussed. The principle of analogy
is formulated, which makes it possible to efficiently construct exact solutions of nonlinear pantograph-type
PDEs. A number of exact solutions of more complex nonlinear functional differential equations
with varying delay, which arbitrarily depends on time or spatial coordinate, are also described.
The presented equations and their exact solutions can be used to formulate test problems designed
to evaluate the accuracy of numerical and approximate analytical methods for solving the corresponding
nonlinear initial-boundary value problems for PDEs with varying delay.

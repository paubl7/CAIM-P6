The Einstein vacuum equations on an (n+1)-dimensional toroidal manifold $\mathbb{M}^{n+1}=\mathbb{T}^{n}\times\mathbb{R}^{+}$
reduce to a system of n-dimensional nonlinear ODEs in terms of the set of toroidal radii $(a_{i})_{i=1}^{n}$
or the radial moduli fields $(\psi_{i})_{i=1}^{n}=(\log(a_{i}(t))_{i=1}^{n}$ of the n-torus
$\mathbb{T}^{n}$. This geometry is also the basis of Kasner-Bianchi-type cosmologies. The equations
are trivially satisfied for static solutions $\psi_{i}^{E}=\psi^{E}$ or radii $a_{i}^{E}=a^{E}$,
describing an initially static toroidal 'micro-universe' or 'vacuum bubble'. It is Lyapunov stable
to short-pulse deterministic perturbations, which have a sharp Gaussian profile: the perturbed
radii rapidly converge to new attractors and therefore to new stable equilibria. These perturbations
induce transitions between stable states. Introducing classical random fluctuations or perturbations,
with a regulated covariance, the radial moduli become Gaussian random fields paramatrizing a 'toroidal
random geometry'. The randomly perturbed Einstein equations are then interpreted as a stochastic
n-dimensional nonlinear dynamical system. Non-vanishing 'cosmological constant' terms are
retained within the averaged equations since they are nonlinear. This is analogous to averaging
the Navier-Stokes equations in statistical turbulence theory, which yields an additional non-vanishing
Reynolds term, since like the Einstein equations they are also of nonlinear hyperbolic type. The
expectations of the randomly perturbed toric radii can be estimated from a cumulant expansion method.
The initially static toroidal vacuum bubble undergoes eternal 'noise-induced' stochastic exponential
growth or inflation. Random radial moduli fields within this scenario therefore act like a 'dark
energy'. Finally, a class of random perturbations is considered for which this Einstein system
is stable.

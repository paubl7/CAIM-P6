We study continuous bounded cohomology of totally disconnected locally compact groups with coefficients
in a non-Archimedian field $K$. To capture the features of classical amenability that induce the
vanishing of real bounded cohomology, we introduce the notion of normed $K$-amenability, of which
we prove an algebraic characterization. It implies that normed $K$-amenable groups are locally
elliptic, and it relates an invariant, the norm of a $K$-amenable group, to the order of its discrete
finite $p$-subquotients, where $p$ is the characteristic of the residue field of $K$. We also prove
a bounded cohomological characterization for discrete groups. The algebraic characterization
shows that normed $K$-amenability is a restrictive condition, so the bounded cohomological one
suggests that there should be plenty of groups with rich bounded cohomology with trivial $K$ coefficients.
We explore this intuition by studying the comparison map, for which surprisingly general statements
are available. We show that if $K$ has positive characteristic or a residue field of characteristic
0, then the comparison map is injective in all degrees. If $K$ is a finite extension of $Q_p$, we classify
quasimorphisms of a group and relate them to its subgroup structure. For discrete groups, we show
that suitable finiteness conditions imply that the comparison map is an isomorphism; this applies
to finitely presented groups in degree 2. It applies in all degrees to fundamental groups of aspherical
CW-complexes with a finite number of cells in each dimension. This can also be justified by looking
at bounded cohomology of topological spaces over $K$, which is naturally isomorphic to cellular
cohomology for CW-complexes with the above property. This follows from the fact that bounded cohomology
over $K$ is a cohomology theory, except for a weaker version of additivity which is however equivalent
for finite unions.

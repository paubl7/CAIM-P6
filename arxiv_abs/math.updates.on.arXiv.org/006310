Fix primes $p$ and $\ell$ with $\ell\neq p$. If $(A,\lambda)$ is a $g$-dimensional principally
polarized abelian variety, an $(\ell)^g$-isogeny of $(A,\lambda)$ has kernel a maximal isotropic
subgroup of the $\ell$-torsion of $A$; the image has a natural principal polarization. We define
three isogeny graphs associated to such $(\ell)^g$-isogenies -- the big isogeny graph $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$,
the little isogeny graph $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$, and the enhanced isogeny graph $\widetilde{\mathit{gr}}_{\!g}(\ell,
p)$. We prove that all three isogeny graphs are connected. One ingredient of the proof is strong approximation
for the quaternionic unitary group, which has previously been applied to moduli of abelian varieties
in charateristic $p$ by Chai, Ekedahl/Oort, and Chai/Oort. The adjacency matrices of the three
isogeny graphs are given in terms of the Brandt matrices defined by Hashimoto, Ibukiyama, Ihara,
and Shimizu. We study some basic properties of these Brandt matrices and recast the theory using
the notion of Brandt graphs. We show that the isogeny graphs $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell, p)$ and $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell,
p)$ are in fact our Brandt graphs. We give the $\ell$-adic uniformization of $\mathit{gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$
and $\widetilde{\mathit{gr}}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$. The $(\ell+1)$-regular isogeny graph $\mathit{Gr}_1(\ell,p)$
for supersingular elliptic curves is well known to be Ramanujan. We calculate the Brandt matrices
for a range of $g>1$, $\ell$, and $p$. These calculations give four examples with $g>1$ where the
regular graph $\mathit{Gr}_{\!g}(\ell,p)$ has two vertices and is Ramanujan, and all other examples
we computed with $g>1$ and two or more vertices were not Ramanujan. In particular, the $(\ell)^g$-isogeny
graph is not in general Ramanujan for $g>1$.

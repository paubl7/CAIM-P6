We examine caloric measures $\omega$ on general domains in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1} = \mathbb{R}^n\times\mathbb{R}$
(space $\times$ time) from the perspective of geometric measure theory. On one hand, we give a direct
proof of a consequence of a theorem of Taylor and Watson (1985) that the lower parabolic Hausdorff
dimension of $\omega$ is at least $n$ and $\omega \ll \mathcal{H}^n$. On the other hand, we prove
that the upper parabolic Hausdorff dimension of $\omega$ is at most $n+2-\beta_n$, where $\beta_n
> 0$ depends only on $n$. Analogous bounds for harmonic measures were first shown by Nevanlinna (1934)
and Bourgain (1987). We also identify and correct an error in the paper by Bourgain. Heuristically,
we show that the density of obstacles in a cube needed to make it unlikely that a Brownian motion started
outside of the cube exits a domain near the center of the cube must be chosen according to the ambient
dimension. In the course of the proof, we give a caloric measure analogue of Bourgain's alternative:
for any constants $0 < \epsilon \ll_n \delta < 1/2$ and closed set $E \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$,
either (i) $E \cap Q$ has relatively large caloric measure in $Q \setminus E$ for every pole in $F$
or (ii) $E \cap Q_*$ has relatively small $\rho$-dimensional parabolic Hausdorff content for every
$n < \rho \leq n+2$, where $Q$ is a cube, $F$ is a subcube of $Q$ aligned at the center of the top time-face,
and $Q_*$ is a subcube of $Q$ that is close to, but separated backwards-in-time from $F$: $$Q = (-1/2,1/2)^n
\times (-1,0), \quad F = [-1/2+\delta,1/2-\delta]^n\times[-\epsilon^2,0),$$ $$\text{and}\quad
Q_* = [-1/2+\delta,1/2-\delta]^n\times[-3\epsilon^2,-2\epsilon^2].$$ Further, we supply
a version of the strong Markov property for caloric measures.

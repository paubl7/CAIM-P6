A canonical Huffman sequence is characterized by a zero inner-product between itself and each of
its shifted copies, except at their largest relative shifts: their aperiodic auto-correlation
then becomes delta-like, a single central peak surrounded by zeros, with one non-zero entry at each
end. Prior work showed that the few known families of Huffman sequences (of length $N = 4n-1$, for
integers $n > 1$, with continuously scalable elements) are based upon Fibonacci polynomials. Related
multi-dimensional ($nD$) Huffman arrays were designed, as well as non-canonical quasi-Huffman
arrays that also possess delta-like auto-correlations. We examined links between these discrete
sequences and delta-correlated functions defined on the continuum, and provided simple non-iterative
approaches to successfully deconvolve $nD$ data blurred by diffuse Huffman arrays. Here we describe
new constructions for canonical Huffman sequences. Examples of length $N = 4n+1$, $N = 2n$ and families
of arbitrary length are given, including scaled forms, as well as for Fibonacci-based arrays with
perfect periodic auto-correlations, that are zero for all non-zero cyclic shifts. A generalization
to include canonical sequences with complex scale factors invokes an equally useful dual form of
delta-correlation. We also present $1D$ arrays with a much smaller dynamic range than those where
the elements are built using Fibonacci recursion. When Huffman arrays (that are comprised of inherently
signed values) are employed as diffuse probe beams for image acquisition, a new two-mask de-correlating
step is described here that significantly reduces the total incident radiation dose compared to
a prior method that added a positive pedestal-offset.

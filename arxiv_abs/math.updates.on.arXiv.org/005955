Internet-of-Things (IoT) is featured with low-power communications among a massive number of
ubiquitously-deployed and energy-constrained electronics, e.g., sensors and actuators. To
cope with the demand, wireless-powered cooperative relaying emerges as a promising communication
paradigm to extend data transmission coverage and solve energy scarcity for the IoT devices. In
this paper, we propose a novel hybrid relaying strategy by combining wireless-powered communication
and ambient backscattering functions to improve applicability and performance of data transfer.
In particular, the hybrid relay can harvest energy from radio frequency (RF) signals and use the
energy for active transmission. Alternatively, the hybrid relay can choose to perform ambient
backscattering of incident RF signals for passive transmission. To efficiently utilize the ambient
RF resource, we design mode selection protocols to coordinate between the active and passive relaying
in circumstances with and without instantaneous channel gain. With different mode selection protocols,
we characterize the success probability and ergodic capacity of a dual-hop relaying system with
the hybrid relay in the field of randomly located ambient transmitters. The analytical and the numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the mode selection protocols in adapting the hybrid relaying
into the network environment and reveal the impacts of system parameters on the performance gain
of the hybrid relaying. As applications of our analytical framework which is computationally tractable,
we formulate optimization problems based on the derived expressions to optimize the system parameters
with different objectives. The optimal solutions exhibit a tradeoff between the maximum energy
efficiency and target success probability.

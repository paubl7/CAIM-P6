There is an intrinsic value in higher integration of multi-carrier energy systems (especially
gas and electricity), to increase operational flexibility in the electricity system and to improve
allocation of resources in gas and electricity networks. The integration of different energy carrier
markets is challenging due to the existence of physical and economic dependencies between the different
energy carriers. We propose in this paper an integrated day-ahead multi-carrier gas, electricity
and heat market clearing which includes new types of orders and constraints on these orders to represent
techno-economic constraints of conversion and storage technologies. We prove that the proposed
market clearing gives rise to competitive equilibria. In addition, we propose two decentralised
clearing algorithms which differ in how the decomposition of the underlying centralised clearing
optimisation problem is performed. This has implications in terms of the involved agents and their
mutual information exchange. It is proven that they yield solutions equivalent to the centralised
market clearing under a mild assumption of sufficient number of iterations. We argue that such an
integrated multi-carrier energy market mitigates (spot) market risks faced by market participants
and enables better spot pricing of the different energy carriers. The results show that conversion/storage
technology owners would suffer from losses and/or opportunity costs, if they were obliged to only
use elementary orders. For the test cases considered in this article, sum of losses and opportunity
costs could reach up to 13,000 EUR/day and 9,000 EUR/day respectively, compared with the case where
conversion and storage orders are used.

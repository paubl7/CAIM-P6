Non-locality is being intensively studied in various PDE-contexts and in variational problems.
The numerical approximation also looks challenging, as well as the application of these models
to Continuum Mechanics and Image Analysis, among other areas. Even though there is a growing body
of deep and fundamental knowledge about non-locality, for variational principles there are still
very basic questions that have not been addressed so far. Taking some of these as a motivation, we
describe a general perspective on distinct classes of non-local variational principles setting
a program for the analysis of this kind of problems. We start such program with the simplest problem
possible: that of scalar, uni-dimensional cases, under a particular class of non-locality. Even
in this simple initial scenario, one finds quite unexpected facts to the point that our intuition
about local, classic problems can no longer guide us for these new problems. There are three main
issues worth highlighting, in the particular situation treated: $\bullet$ despite the different
nature of non-locality as compared to the classic, local situation, the natural underlying spaces
still are the standard Sobolev spaces; $\bullet$ no convexity of integrands is required for existence
of minimizers; $\bullet$ optimality is formulated in terms of quite special integral equations
rather than differential equations. We are thus able to provide some specific answers to the initial
questions that motivated our investigation. In subsequent papers, we will move on to consider the
higher dimensional situation driven by the possibility that no convexity or quasiconvexity might
be involved in weak lower semicontinuity in a full vector, higher dimensional situation.

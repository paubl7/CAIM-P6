Here we consider an extension MFcind of the Minimalist Foundation MF for predicative constructive
mathematics with the addition of inductive and coinductive definitions sufficient to generate
Sambin's Positive topologies, i.e. Martin-L\"of-Sambin formal topologies equipped with a Positivity
relation (used to describe pointfree formal closed subsets). In particular the intensional level
of MFcind, called mTTcind, is defined by extending with coinductive definitions another theory
mTTind extending the intensional level mTT of MF with the sole addition of inductive definitions.
In previous work we have shown that mTTind is consistent with Formal Church's Thesis CT and the Axiom
of Choice AC via an interpretation in Aczel's CZF+REA. Our aim is to show the expectation that the
addition of coinductive definitions to mTTind does not increase its consistency strength by reducing
the consistency of mTTcind+CT+AC to the consistency of CZF+REA through various interpretations.
We actually reach our goal in two ways. One way consists in first interpreting mTTcind+CT+AC in the
theory extending CZF with the Union Regular Extension Axiom, REA_U, a strengthening of REA, and
the Axiom of Relativized Dependent Choice, RDC. The theory CZF+REA_U+RDC is then interpreted in
MLS*, a version of Martin-L\"of's type theory with Palmgren's superuniverse S. A last step consists
in interpreting MLS* back into CZF+REA. The alternative way consists in first interpreting mTTcind+AC+CT
directly in a version of Martin-L\"of's type theory with Palmgren's superuniverse extended with
CT, which is then interpreted back to CZF+REA. A key benefit of the first way is that the theory CZF+REA_U+RDC
also supports the intended set-theoretic interpretation of the extensional level of MFcind. Finally,
all the theories considered, except mTTcind+AC+CT, are shown to be of the same proof-theoretic
strength.

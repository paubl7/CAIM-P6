Over the last 100 years, the group-theoretic characterization of crystalline solids has provided
the foundational language for diverse problems in physics and chemistry. There exist two classes
of crystalline solids: nonmagnetic crystals left invariant by space groups (SGs), and solids with
commensurate magnetic order that respect the symmetries of magnetic space groups (MSGs). Whereas
many of the properties of the SGs, such as their momentum-space corepresentations (coreps) and
elementary band coreps (EBRs) were tabulated with relative ease, progress on deriving the analogous
properties of the MSGs has largely stalled for the past 70 years due to the complicated symmetries
of magnetic crystals. In this work, we complete the 100-year-old problem of crystalline group theory
by deriving the small coreps, momentum stars, compatibility relations, and magnetic EBRs (MEBRs)
of the single (spinless) and double (spinful) MSGs. We have implemented freely-accessible tools
on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server for accessing the coreps of the MSGs, whose wide-ranging
applications include neutron diffraction investigations of magnetic structure, the interplay
of lattice regularization and (symmetry-enhanced) fermion doubling, and magnetic topological
phases, such as axion insulators and spin liquids. Using the MEBRs, we extend the earlier theory
of Topological Quantum Chemistry to the MSGs to form a complete, real-space theory of band topology
in magnetic and nonmagnetic crystalline solids - Magnetic Topological Quantum Chemistry (MTQC).
We then use MTQC to derive the complete set of symmetry-based indicators (SIs) of band topology in
all spinful (fermionic) crystals, for which we identify symmetry-respecting bulk and anomalous
surface and hinge states. Lastly, using the SIs, we discover several novel non-axionic magnetic
higher-order topological insulators.

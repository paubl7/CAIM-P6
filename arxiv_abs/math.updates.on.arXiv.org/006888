Consider a system of homogeneous interacting diffusive particles labeled by the nodes of a unimodular
Galton-Watson (UGW) tree, where the state of each node evolves like a d-dimensional diffusion whose
drift coefficient depends on (the histories of) its own state and the states of neighboring nodes,
and whose diffusion coefficient depends only on (the history of) its own state. Under suitable regularity
assumptions on the coefficients, an autonomous characterization is obtained for the marginal
distribution of the dynamics of the neighborhood of a typical node in terms of a certain local equation,
which is a new kind of SDE that is nonlinear in the sense of McKean. This equation describes a finite-dimensional
non-Markovian stochastic process whose evolution at any time depends not only on the structure
and current state of the neighborhood, but also on the conditional law of the current state given
the past of the states of neighborhing nodes. Such marginal distributions are of interest because
they arise as weak limits of both marginal distributions and empirical measures of interacting
diffusions on many sequences of sparse random graphs, including the configuration model and Erdos-Renyi
graphs whose average degrees converge to a finite non-zero limit. The results obtained complement
classical results in the mean-field regime, which characterize the limiting dynamics of homogeneous
interacting diffusions on complete graphs, as the number of nodes goes to infinity, in terms of a
corresponding nonlinear Markov process. However, in the sparse graph setting, the topology of
the graph strongly influences the dynamics, and the analysis requires a completely different approach.
The proofs of existence and uniqueness of the local equation rely on delicate new conditional independence
and symmetry properties of particle trajectories on UGW trees, as well as judicious use of changes
of measure.

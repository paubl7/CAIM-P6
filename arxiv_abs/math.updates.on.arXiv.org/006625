This paper emerged as a result of tackling the following three issues. Firstly, we would like the
well known embedding of bicategories into pseudo double categories to be monoidal, which it is not
if one uses the usual notion of a monoidal pseudo double category. Secondly, in \cite{Gabi} the question
was raised: which would be an alternative notion to intercategories of Grandis and Par\'e, so that
monoids in B\"ohm's monoidal category $(Dbl,\ot)$ of strict double categories and strict double
functors with a Gray type monoidal product be an example of it? We obtain and prove that precisely
the monoidal structure of $(Dbl,\ot)$ resolves the first question. On the other hand, resolving
the second question, we upgrade the category $Dbl$ to a tricategory $\DblPs$ and propose %an alternative
definition of intercategories as to consider internal categories in this tricategory. %, enabling
monoids in $(Dbl,\ot)$ to be examples of this gadget. Apart from monoids in $(Dbl,\ot)$ - more importanlty,
weak pseudomonoids in a tricategory containing $(Dbl,\ot)$ as a sub 1-category - most of the examples
of intercategories are also examples of this gadget, the ones that escape are those that rely on laxness
of the product on the pullback, as duoidal categories. For the latter purpose we define categories
internal to tricategories (of the type of $\DblPs$), which simultaneously serves our third motive.
Namely, inspired by the tricategory and $(1\times 2)$-category of tensor categories, we prove
under mild conditions that categories enriched over certain type of tricategories may be made into
categories internal in them. We illustrate this occurrence for tensor categories with respect
to the ambient tricategory $2\x\Cat_{wk}$ of 2-categories, pseudofunctors, pseudonatural transformations
and modifications.

The Eshelby formalism for an inclusion in a solid is of significant theoretical and practical implications
in mechanics and other fields of heterogeneous media. Eshelby's finding that a uniform eigenstrain
prescribed in a solitary ellipsoidal inclusion in an infinite isotropic medium results in a uniform
elastic strain field in the inclusion leads to the conjecture that the ellipsoid is the only inclusion
that possesses the so-called Eshelby property. Previously, only the weak version of the conjecture
has been proved for the isotropic medium, whereas the general validity of the conjecture for anisotropic
media is yet to be explored. In this work, firstly, we present proofs of the weak version of the generalized
Eshelby conjecture for anisotropic media that possess cubic, transversely isotropic, orthotropic,
and monoclinic symmetries. Secondly, we prove that in these anisotropic media, there exist non-ellipsoidal
inclusions that can transform particular polynomial eigenstrains of even degrees into polynomial
elastic strain fields of the same even degrees in them. These results constitute counter-examples,
in the strong sense, to the generalized high-order Eshelby conjecture (inverse problem of Eshelby's
polynomial conservation theorem) for polynomial eigenstrains in both anisotropic media and the
isotropic medium (quadratic eigenstrain only). These findings reveal striking richness of the
uniformity between the eigenstrains and the correspondingly induced elastic strains in inclusions
in anisotropic media beyond the canonical ellipsoidal inclusions. Since the strain fields in embedded
and inherently anisotropic quantum dot crystals are effective tuning knobs of the quality of the
emitted photons by the quantum dots, the results may have implications in the technology of quantum
information, in addition to in mechanics and materials science.

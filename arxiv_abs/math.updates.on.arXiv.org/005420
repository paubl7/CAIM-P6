With the high development of wireless communication techniques, it is widely used in various fields
for convenient and efficient data transmission. Different from commonly used assumption of the
time-invariant wireless channel, we focus on the research on the time-varying wireless downlink
channel to get close to the practical situation. Our objective is to gain the maximum value of sum
rate in the time-varying channel under the some constraints about cut-off signal-to-interference
and noise ratio (SINR), transmitted power and beamforming. In order to adapt the rapid changing
channel, we abandon the frequently used algorithm convex optimization and deep reinforcement
learning algorithms are used in this paper. From the view of the ordinary measures such as power control,
interference incoordination and beamforming, continuous changes of measures should be put into
consideration while sparse reward problem due to the abortion of episodes as an important bottleneck
should not be ignored. Therefore, with the analysis of relevant algorithms, we proposed two algorithms,
Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm (DDPG) and hierarchical DDPG, in our work. As for
these two algorithms, in order to solve the discrete output, DDPG is established by combining the
Actor-Critic algorithm with Deep Q-learning (DQN), so that it can output the continuous actions
without sacrificing the existed advantages brought by DQN and also can improve the performance.
Also, to address the challenge of sparse reward, we take advantage of meta policy from the idea of
hierarchical theory to divide one agent in DDPG into one meta-controller and one controller as hierarchical
DDPG. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed DDPG and hierarchical DDPG performs
well from the views of coverage, convergence and sum rate performance.

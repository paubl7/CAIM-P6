There are six different mathematical formulations of the symmetry group in quantum mechanics,
among them the set of pure states $\mathbf{P}$ -- i.e. the set of one-dimensional projections on
a complex Hilbert space $H$ -- and the orthomodular lattice $\mathbf{L}$ of closed subspaces of
$H$. These six groups are isomorphic when the dimension of $H$ is $\geq 3$. The latter hypothesis
is absolutely necessary in this identification. For example, the automorphisms group of all bijections
preserving the orthogonality and the order on $\mathbf{L}$ identifies with the bijections on $\mathbf{P}$
preserving transition probabilities only if dim$(H)\geq 3$. %(see [G. Cassinelli et al., \emph{Rev.
Mat. Phys.}, 1997]). This identification leads to Uhlhorn's version of Wigner's theorem. Despite
of the difficulties caused by $M_2(\mathbb{C})$, rank two algebras are used for quantum mechanics
description of the spin state of spin-$\frac12$ particles, there is a counterexample for Uhlhorn's
version of Wigner's theorem for such state space. In this note we prove that in order that the description
of the spin will be relativistic, it is not enough to preserve the projection lattice equipped with
its natural partial order, but we also need to preserve the partial order set of all tripotents, which
strictly enlarges the set of projections. Concretely, we show that a bijection between the sets
of tripotents of two atomic JBW$^*$-triples non-containing rank-one Cartan factors, preserving
the natural order in both directions and satisfying some weak continuity hypothesis can be extended
to a complex-linear or to a conjugate-linear triple automorphism. This, in particular, extends
a result of Moln{\'a}r to all bounded symmetric domains associated with Cartan factors of rank $\geq
2$ and atomic JBW$^*$-triples non-containing rank-one Cartan factors, and provides new models
to present quantum behavior.

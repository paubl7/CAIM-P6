In this paper we address game theory problems arising in the context of network security. In traditional
game theory problems, given a defender and an attacker, one searches for mixed strategies which
minimize a linear payoff functional. In the problems addressed in this paper an additional quadratic
term is added to the minimization problem. Such term represents switching costs, i.e., the costs
for the defender of switching from a given strategy to another one at successive rounds of a Nash game.
The resulting problems are nonconvex QP ones with linear constraints and turn out to be very challenging.
We will show that the most recent approaches for the minimization of nonconvex QP functions over
polytopes, including commercial solvers such as CPLEX and GUROBI, are unable to solve to optimality
even test instances with n = 50 variables. For this reason, we propose to extend with them the current
benchmark set of test instances for QP problems. We also present a spatial branch-and-bound approach
for the solution of these problems, where a predominant role is played by an optimality-based domain
reduction, with multiple solutions of LP problems at each node of the branch-and-bound tree. Of
course, domain reductions are standard tools in spatial branch-and-bound approaches. However,
our contribution lies in the observation that, from the computational point of view, a rather aggressive
application of these tools appears to be the best way to tackle the proposed instances. Indeed, according
to our experiments, while they make the computational cost per node high, this is largely compensated
by the rather slow growth of the number of nodes in the branch-and-bound tree, so that the proposed
approach strongly outperforms the existing solvers for QP problems.

Relations among various musical concepts are investigated through a new concept, musical icosahedron
that is the regular icosahedron each of whose vertices has one of 12 tones. First, we found that there
exist four musical icosahedra that characterize the topology of the chromatic scale and one of the
whole tone scales, and have the hexagon-icosahedron symmetry (an operation of raising all the tones
of a given scale by two semitones corresponds to a symmetry transformation of the regular icosahedron):
chromatic/whole tone musical icosahedra. The major triads or the minor triads are set on the golden
triangles of these musical icosahedra. Also, various dualities between musical concepts are shown
by these musical icosahedra: the major triads/scales and the minor triads/scales, the major/minor
triads and the fundamental triads for the hexatonic major/minor scales, the major/minor scales
and the Gregorian modes. Second, we proposed Pythagorean/whole tone musical icosahedra that characterize
the topology of the Pythagorean chain and one of the whole tone scales, and have the hexagon-icosahedron
symmetry. The Pythagorean chain (chromatic scale) in the chromatic (Pythagorean)/whole tone
musical icosahedron is constructed by "middle" lines of the regular icosahedron. While some golden
triangles correspond to the major/minor triads in the chromatic/whole tone musical icosahedra,
in the Pythagorean/whole tone musical icosahedra, some golden gnomons correspond to the minor/major
triads. Third, we found four types of musical icosahedra other than the chromatic/whole tone musical
icosahedra and the Pythagorean/whole tone musical icosahedra that have the hexagon-icosahedron
symmetry. All the major triads and minor triads are represented by the golden triangles or the golden
gnomons on each type. All of these musical icosahedra lead to generalizations of major/minor triads
and scales.

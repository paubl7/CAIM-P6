In [22] Milnor proved that a real analytic map $f\colon (R^n,0) \to (R^p,0)$, where $n \geq p$, with
an isolated critical point at the origin has a fibration on the tube $f|\colon B_\epsilon^n \cap
f^{-1}(S_\delta^{p-1}) \to S_\delta^{p-1}$. Constructing a vector field such that, (1) it is
transverse to the spheres, and (2) it is transverse to the tubes, he "inflates" the tube to the sphere,
to get a fibration $\varphi\colon S_\epsilon^{n-1} \setminus f^{-1}(0) \to S^{p-1}$, but the
projection is not necessarily given by $f/ \|f\|$ as in the complex case. In the case $f$ has isolated
critical value, in [9] it was proved that if the fibres inside a small tube are transverse to the sphere
$S_\epsilon$, then it has a fibration on the tube. Also in [9], the concept of $d$-regularity was
defined, it turns out that $f$ is $d$-regular if and only if the map $f/|f\|\colon S_\epsilon^{n-1}
\setminus f^{-1}(0) \to S^{p-1}$ is a fibre bundle equivalent to the one on the tube. In this article,
we prove the corresponding facts in a more general setting: if a locally surjective map $f$ has a linear
discriminant $\Delta$ and a fibration on the tube $f|\colon B_\epsilon^n \cap f^{-1}(S_\delta^{p-1}
\setminus \Delta) \to S_\delta^{p-1} \setminus \Delta$, then $f$ is $d$-regular if and only if
the map $f/ \|f\|\colon S_\epsilon^{n-1} \setminus f^{-1}(\Delta) \to S^{p-1} \setminus \mathcal{A}$
(with $\mathcal{A}$ the radial projection of $\Delta$ on $S^{p-1}$) is a fibre bundle equivalent
to the one on the tube. We do this by constructing a vector field $\tilde{w}$ which inflates the tube
to the sphere in a controlled way, it satisfies properties analogous to the vector field constructed
by Milnor in the complex setting: besides satisfying (1) and (2) above, it also satisfies that $f/
\|f\|$ is constant on the integral curves of $\tilde{w}$.

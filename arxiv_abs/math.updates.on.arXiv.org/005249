In the past decade, an intensive study of strong approximation of stochastic differential equations
(SDEs) with a drift coefficient that has discontinuities in space has begun. In the majority of these
results it is assumed that the drift coefficient satisfies piecewise regularity conditions and
that the diffusion coefficient is globally Lipschitz continuous and non-degenerate at the discontinuities
of the drift coefficient. Under this type of assumptions the best $L_p$-error rate obtained so far
for approximation of scalar SDEs at the final time is $3/4$ in terms of the number of evaluations of
the driving Brownian motion. In the present article we prove for the first time in the literature
sharp lower error bounds for such SDEs. We show that for a huge class of additive noise driven SDEs
of this type the $L_p$-error rate $3/4$ can not be improved. For the proof of this result we employ
a novel technique by studying equations with coupled noise: we reduce the analysis of the $L_p$-error
of an arbitrary approximation based on evaluation of the driving Brownian motion at finitely many
times to the analysis of the $L_p$-distance of two solutions of the same equation that are driven
by Brownian motions that are coupled at the given time-points and independent, conditioned on their
values at these points. To obtain lower bounds for the latter quantity, we prove a new quantitative
version of positive association for bivariate normal random variables $(Y,Z)$ by providing explict
lower bounds for the covariance $\text{Cov}(f(Y),g(Z))$ in case of piecewise Lipschitz continuous
functions $f$ and $g$. In addition it turns out that our proof technique also leads to lower error
bounds for estimating occupation time functionals $\int_0^1 f(W_t)\, dt$ of a Brownian motion
$W$, which substantially extends known results for the case of $f$ being an indicator function.

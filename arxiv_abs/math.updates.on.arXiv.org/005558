The point of this work is to construct geometric structures on the oriented closed prime three-manifolds
that don't at present already have them. One knows these compound prime three-manifolds, have canonically
up to deformation from the identity, incompressible torus walls whose complementary components
are diffeomorphic to "elemental" prime three-manifolds carrying single Thurston geometries.
These geometric elementary parts have finite volume or linear volume growth. This metric geometry
is generalized here to Lie geometry meaning an open cover by special coordinate charts in a model
space whose transition mappings are related by one of several finite dimensional Lie groups acting
on the model space. The Lie group is allowed to vary in a constrained manner from region to region in
the manifold. Our geometric version of torus wall crossing after fixing finitely many parameters
is rigid using covering spaces, pushouts, and sliding flat toroidal cylinders rigidly together.
A new concept, Lie generated geometry, describes abstractly what these constructions produce.
These Lie generated geometries are determined by special coordinate chart coverings as suggested
above, but structurally they consist of sheaves of germs of charts into the upper half space which
are related by four Lie groups acting there. The key point beside the Lie group generating system
is that each germ of the structure can be analytically continued along any path, like solving a classical
ODE in the complex plane. This defines for each Lie geometrized manifold a developing map of its universal
cover into upper half space. The Theorem solves a 44 year old question from a 1976 Princeton math department
preprint motivated by the Poincar\'{e} Conjecture and finally documented in the 1983 reference
of Thurston and the second author.

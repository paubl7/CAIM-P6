Many intuitively valid arguments involving intensionality cannot be captured by first-order
logic, even when extended by modal and epistemic operators. We present Bealer's solution to this
problem which hinges on an ontological commitment to theory of Properties, Propositions and Relations
(PRP). At the most basic level we can distinguish two conceptions in the theory of PRPs. An objective
one tied to modality and necessary equivalence, and a mental (intentional) one tied to concepts
and the requirement of non-circularity in definitions. Bealer proposes two distinct intensional
logics T1 and T2 corresponding to these two conceptions, both based on the language of first-order
logic extended with an intensional abstraction operator. In T1 necessitation can be directly defined
and the axioms entail that we obtain standard S5 modal logic. Bealer constructs a non-Tarskian algebraic
semantic frameworkyielding two classes of models for which T1 and T2 are both sound and complete.
Bealer proposes his logic as the basis of a larger philosophical project in the tradition of logicism
(or logical realism) concerning which we refer to his book Quality and Concept (1982). This includes
a neo-Fregean logicist foundation of arithmetic. The proof of these results consists either of
lemmas which are merely stated or which are given brief sketches of a proof. We aim to give detailed
proofs of the results that appear in Bealer's \emph{Quality and Concept} and in \cite{C} and to clarify
and simplify some of the concepts and techniques so as to bring this work to a larger audience of philosophers,
logicians, linguists and mathematicians and to be better equipped to address some of the unsolved
problems and challenges.

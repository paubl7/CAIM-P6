Passive states, i.e., those states from which no work can be extracted via unitary operations, play
an important role in the foundations and applications of quantum thermodynamics. They generalize
the familiar Gibbs thermal states, which are the sole passive states being stable under tensor product.
Here, we introduce a partial order on the set of passive states that captures the idea of a passive
state being virtually cooler than another one. This partial order, which we build by defining the
notion of relative passivity, offers a fine-grained comparison between passive states based on
virtual temperatures (just like thermal states are compared based on their temperatures). We then
characterize the quantum operations that are closed on the set of virtually cooler states with respect
to some fixed input and output passive states. Viewing the activity, i.e., non-passivity, of a state
as a resource, our main result is then a necessary and sufficient condition on the transformation
of a class of pure active states under these relative passivity-preserving operations. This condition
gives a quantum thermodynamical meaning to the majorization relation on the set of non-increasing
vectors due to Hoffman. The maximum extractable work under relative passivity-preserving operations
is then shown to be equal to the ergotropy of these pure active states. Finally, we are able to fully
characterize passivity-preserving operations in the simpler case of qubit systems, and hence
to derive a state interconversion condition under passivity-preserving qubit operations. The
prospect of this work is a general resource-theoretical framework for the extractable work via
quantum operations going beyond thermal operations.

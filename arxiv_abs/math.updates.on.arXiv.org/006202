A matrix $A$ is called totally positive (or totally non-negative) of order $k$, denoted by TP_k (or
TN_k), if all minors of size at most $k$ are positive (or non-negative). These matrices have featured
in diverse areas in mathematics, including algebra, analysis, combinatorics, and probability
theory. The goal of this article is to provide a novel connection between total positivity and optimization/game
theory. Specifically, we draw a relationship between totally positive matrices and the Linear
Complementarity Problem (LCP), which generalizes and unifies linear and quadratic programming
problems and bimatrix games - this connection is unexplored, to the best of our knowledge. We show
that $A$ is $TP_k$ if and only if for every square submatrix $A_r$ of $A$, $LCP(A_r,q)$ has a unique
solution for each vector $q<0$. In fact this can be strengthened to check the solution set of LCP at
a single vector for each such square submatrix. These novel characterizations are in the spirit
of classical results characterizing $TP$ matrices by Gantmacher-Krein [Compos. Math. 1937] and
P-matrices by Ingleton [Proc. London Math. Soc. 1966]. Our work contains two other contributions,
both of which characterize TP using single test vectors. First, we improve on one of the main results
in recent joint work [Bull. London Math. Soc., in press], which provided a novel characterization
of TP_k matrices using sign non-reversal phenomena. We further improve on a classical characterization
of TP by Brown-Johnstone-MacGibbon [J. Amer. Statist. Assoc. 1981] (following Gantmacher-Krein,
1950) involving the variation diminishing property. Finally, we use a P\'olya frequency function
of Karlin [Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 1964] to show that our aforementioned characterizations of TP,
involving test-vectors drawn from the `alternating' bi-orthant, do not work if these vectors are
drawn from any other open orthant.

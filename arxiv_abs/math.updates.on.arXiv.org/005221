Attempting to recognize a tree inside a phylogenetic network is a fundamental undertaking in evolutionary
analysis. In the last few years, therefore, tree-based phylogenetic networks, which are defined
by a spanning tree called a subdivision tree, have attracted attention of theoretical biologists.
However, the application of such networks is still not easy, due to many problems whose time complexities
are not clearly understood. In this paper, we provide a general framework for solving those various
old or new problems from a coherent perspective, rather than analyzing the complexity of each individual
problem or developing an algorithm one by one. More precisely, we establish a structure theorem
that gives a way to canonically decompose any rooted binary phylogenetic network N into maximal
zig-zag trails that are uniquely determined, and use it to characterize the set of subdivision trees
of N in the form of a direct product, in a way reminiscent of the structure theorem for finitely generated
Abelian groups. From the main results, we derive a series of linear time and linear time delay algorithms
for the following problems: given a rooted binary phylogenetic network N, 1) determine whether
or not N has a subdivision tree and find one if there exists any; 2) measure the deviation of N from being
tree-based; 3) compute the number of subdivision trees of N; 4) list all subdivision trees of N; and
5) find a subdivision tree to maximize or minimize a prescribed objective function. All algorithms
proposed here are optimal in terms of time complexity. Our results do not only imply and unify various
known results, but also answer many open questions and moreover enable novel applications, such
as the estimation of a maximum likelihood tree underlying a tree-based network. The results and
algorithms in this paper still hold true for a special class of rooted non-binary phylogenetic networks.

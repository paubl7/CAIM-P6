This paper is concerned with the stability properties of some PDE models arising in the theory of
linear thermoelastic beams with hyperbolic heat conduction. First, we study the integrodifferential
Bresse-Gurtin-Pipkin system, providing a necessary and sufficient condition for its exponential
stability and the optimal polynomial decay rate when such a condition is violated. Second, we obtain
analogous results for the Bresse-Maxwell-Cattaneo system, completing the analysis recently
initiated in [17]. Finally, we consider the Timoshenko-Gurtin-Pipkin system and we find the optimal
polynomial decay rate when the necessary and sufficient condition for exponential stability determined
in [19] does not hold. As a byproduct of the latter result, we fully recover the stability characterization
of the Timoshenko-Maxwell-Cattaneo system established in [15,46]. The "equal wave speeds" exponential
stability conditions for the Bresse-Fourier and the Timoshenko-Fourier systems obtained in [32,37]
are also recovered through a singular limit procedure. From the physical viewpoint, the conditions
found when the Gurtin-Pipkin and the Maxwell-Cattaneo laws are employed turn out to be compatible
with some structural constraints on the coefficients of the model, such as the positivity of the
Poisson's ratio of the involved material. This never happens when the classical Fourier law is used.
From the mathematical viewpoint, the analysis of the present paper faces several challenges connected
with the hyperbolic thermal damping mechanism, which is the only source of dissipation in the systems.
The resolution of some of these difficulties rests on recently developed tools such as the quantitative
Riemann-Lebesgue lemma derived in [18].

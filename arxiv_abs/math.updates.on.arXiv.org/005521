We define a notion of homotopy Segal cooperad in the category of $ E_\infty $-algebras. This model
of Segal cooperad that we define in the paper, which we call homotopy Segal $ E_\infty $-Hopf cooperad,
covers examples given by the cochain complex of topological operads and provides a framework for
the study of the homotopy of such objects. In a first step, we consider a category of Segal $ E_\infty
$-Hopf cooperads, which consists of collections of $ E_\infty $-algebras indexed by trees and equipped
with coproduct operators, corresponding to tree morphisms, together with facet operators, corresponding
to subtree inclusions. The coproduct operators model coproducts of operations inside a tree. The
facet operators are assumed to satisfy a Segal condition. The homotopy Segal cooperads that we aim
to define are formed by integrating homotopies in the composition schemes of the coproduct operators.
For this purpose, we replace the functorial structure that governs the composition of the coproduct
operators by the structure of a homotopy functor which we shape on a cubical enrichment of the category
of $ E_\infty $-algebras. We prove that every homotopy Segal $ E_\infty $-Hopf cooperad in our sense
is weakly-equivalent to a strict Segal $ E_\infty $-Hopf cooperad. We also define a notion of homotopy
morphism of homotopy Segal $ E_\infty $-Hopf cooperads. We prove that every homotopy Segal $ E_\infty
$-Hopf cooperad admits a cobar construction and that every homotopy morphism of homotopy Segal
$ E_\infty $-Hopf cooperads induces a morphism on this cobar construction, so that our approach
provides a lifting to the context of $ E_\infty $-algebras of classical homotopy cooperad structures
that are modeled on the bar duality of operads when we work in a category of differential graded modules.

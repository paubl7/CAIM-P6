Deterministic models of vegetation often summarize, at a macroscopic scale, a multitude of intrinsically
random events occurring at a microscopic scale. We bridge the gap between these scales by demonstrating
convergence to a mean-field limit for a general class of stochastic models representing each individual
ecological event in the limit of large system size. The proof relies on classical stochastic coupling
techniques that we generalize to cover spatially extended interactions. The mean-field limit
is a spatially extended non-Markovian process characterized by nonlocal integro-differential
equations describing the evolution of the probability for a patch of land to be in a given state (the
generalized Kolmogorov equations of the process, GKEs). We thus provide an accessible general
framework for spatially extending many classical finite-state models from ecology and population
dynamics. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of our approach through a detailed comparison
of our limiting spatial model and the finite-size version of a specific savanna-forest model, the
so-called Staver-Levin model. There is remarkable dynamic consistency between the GKEs and the
finite-size system, in spite of almost sure forest extinction in the finite-size system. To resolve
this apparent paradox, we show that the extinction rate drops sharply when nontrivial equilibria
emerge in the GKEs, and that the finite-size system's quasi-stationary distribution (stationary
distribution conditional on non-extinction) closely matches the bifurcation diagram of the GKEs.
Furthermore, the limit process can support periodic oscillations of the probability distribution,
thus providing an elementary example of a jump process that does not converge to a stationary distribution.
In spatially extended settings, environmental heterogeneity can lead to waves of invasion and
front-pinning phenomena.

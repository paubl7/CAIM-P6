We present a uniform (and unambiguous) procedure for scaling the matter fields in implementing
the conformal method to parameterize and construct solutions of Einstein constraint equations
with coupled matter sources. The approach is based on a phase space representation of the space-time
matter fields after a careful $n+1$ decomposition into spatial fields $B$ and conjugate momenta
$\Pi_B$, which are specified directly and are conformally invariant quantities. We show that if
the Einstein-matter field theory is specified by a Lagrangian which is diffeomorphism invariant
and involves no dependence on derivatives of the space-time metric in the matter portion of the Lagrangian,
then fixing $B$ and $\Pi_B$ results in conformal constraint equations that, for constant-mean
curvature initial data, semi-decouple just as they do for the vacuum Einstein conformal constraint
equations. We prove this result by establishing a structural property of the Einstein momentum
constraint that is independent of the conformal method: For an Einstein-matter field theory which
satisfies the conditions just stated, if $B$ and $\Pi_B$ satisfy the matter Euler-Lagrange equations,
then (in suitable form) the right-hand side of the momentum constraint on each spatial slice depends
only on $B$ and $\Pi_B$ and is independent of the space-time metric. We discuss the details of our
construction in the special cases of the following models: Einstein-Maxwell-charged scalar field,
Einstein-Proca, Einstein-perfect fluid, and Einstein-Maxwell-charged dust. In these examples
we find that our technique gives a theoretical basis for scaling rules, such as those for electromagnetism,
that have worked pragmatically in the past, but also generates new equations with advantageous
features for perfect fluids that allow direct specification of total rest mass and total charge
in any spatial region.

We consider a class of hierarchical noncooperative $N-$player games where the $i$th player solves
a parametrized MPEC with the caveat that the implicit form of the $i$th player's in MPEC is convex
in player strategy, given rival decisions. We consider settings where player playoffs are expectation-valued
with lower-level equilibrium constraints imposed in an almost-sure sense; i.e., player problems
are parametrized stochastic MPECs. We develop computational schemes in two distinct regimes:
(a) {\em Monotone regimes.} When player-specific implicit problems are convex, then the necessary
and sufficient equilibrium conditions are given by a stochastic inclusion. Under a monotonicity
assumption on the operator, we develop a variance-reduced stochastic proximal-point scheme that
achieves deterministic rates of convergence in terms of solving proximal-point problems in both
monotone and strongly monotone regimes. Notably, the schemes do not impose any smoothness assumptions
on player problems and allow for state-dependence in noise; (b) {\em Potentiality.} When the implicit
form of the game admits a potential function, we develop an asynchronous relaxed inexact smoothed
proximal best-response framework. We consider the smoothed counterpart of this game where each
player's problem is smoothed via randomized smoothing. Notably, under suitable assumptions,
we show that an $\eta$-smoothed game admits an $\eta$-approximate Nash equilibrium of the original
game. Our proposed scheme produces a sequence that converges almost surely to an $\eta$-approximate
Nash equilibrium. This scheme is reliant on computing the proximal problem, a stochastic MPEC whose
implicit form has a strongly convex objective, with increasing accuracy in finite-time. The smoothing
framework allows for developing a variance-reduced zeroth-order scheme for such problems that
admits a fast rate of convergence.

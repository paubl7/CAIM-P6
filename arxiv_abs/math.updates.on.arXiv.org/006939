In this paper, we develop a sharp interface tumor growth model to study the effect of both the intratumoral
structure using a controlled necrotic core and the extratumoral nutrient supply from vasculature
on tumor morphology. We first show that our model extends the benchmark results in the literature
using linear stability analysis. Then we solve this generalized model numerically using a spectrally
accurate boundary integral method in an evolving annular domain, not only with a Robin boundary
condition on the outer boundary for the nutrient field which models tumor vasculature, but also
with a static boundary condition on the inner boundary for pressure field which models the control
of tumor necrosis. The discretized linear systems for both pressure and nutrient fields are shown
to be well-conditioned through tracing GMRES iteration numbers. Our nonlinear simulations reveal
the stabilizing effects of angiogenesis and the destabilizing ones of chemotaxis and necrosis
in the development of tumor morphological instabilities if the necrotic core is fixed in a circular
shape. When the necrotic core is controlled in a non-circular shape, the stabilizing effects of
proliferation and the destabilizing ones of apoptosis are observed. Finally, the values of the
nutrient concentration with its fluxes and the pressure level with its normal derivatives, which
are solved accurately at the boundaries, help us to characterize the corresponding tumor morphology
and the level of the biophysical quantities on interfaces required in keeping various shapes of
the necrotic region of the tumor. Interestingly, we notice that when the necrotic region is fixed
in a 3-fold non-circular shape, even if the initial shape of the tumor is circular, the tumor will
evolve into a shape corresponding to the 3-fold symmetry of the shape of the fixed necrotic region.

This paper presents a vehicle speed planning system called the energy-optimal deceleration planning
system (EDPS), which aims to maximize energy recuperation of regenerative braking of connected
and autonomous electrified vehicles. A recuperation energy-optimal speed profile is computed
based on the impending deceleration requirements for turning or stopping at an intersection. This
is computed to maximize the regenerative braking energy while satisfying the physical limits of
an electrified powertrain. In automated driving, the powertrain of an electrified vehicle can
be directly controlled by the vehicle control unit such that it follows the computed optimal speed
profile. To obtain smooth optimal deceleration speed profiles, optimal deceleration commands
are determined by a parameterized polynomial-based deceleration model that is obtained by regression
analyses with real vehicle driving test data. The parameters are dependent on preview information
such as residual time and distance as well as target speed. The key design parameter is deceleration
time, which determines the deceleration speed profile to satisfy the residual time and distance
constraints as well as the target speed requirement. The bounds of deceleration commands corresponding
to the physical limits of the powertrain are deduced from realistic deceleration test driving.
The state constraints are dynamically updated by considering the anticipated road load and the
deceleration preference. For validation and comparisons of the EDPS with different preview distances,
driving simulation tests with a virtual road environment and vehicle-to-infrastructure connectivity
are presented. It is shown that the longer preview distance in the EDPS, the more energy-recuperation.
In comparison with driver-in-the-loop simulation tests, EDPS-based autonomous driving shows
improvements in energy recuperation and reduction in trip time.

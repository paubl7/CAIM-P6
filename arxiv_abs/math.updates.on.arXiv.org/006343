Bayesian optimization is a popular algorithm for sequential optimization of a latent objective
function when sampling from the objective is costly. The search path of the algorithm is governed
by the acquisition function, which defines the agent's search strategy. Conceptually, the acquisition
function characterizes how the optimizer balances exploration and exploitation when searching
for the optimum of the latent objective. In this paper, we explore the inverse problem of Bayesian
optimization; we seek to estimate the agent's latent acquisition function based on observed search
paths. We introduce a probabilistic solution framework for the inverse problem which provides
a principled framework to quantify both the variability with which the agent performs the optimization
task as well as the uncertainty around their estimated acquisition function. We illustrate our
methods by analyzing human behavior from an experiment which was designed to force subjects to balance
exploration and exploitation in search of an invisible target location. We find that while most
subjects demonstrate clear trends in their search behavior, there is significant variation around
these trends from round to round. A wide range of search strategies are exhibited across the subjects
in our study, but upper confidence bound acquisition functions offer the best fit for the majority
of subjects. Finally, some subjects do not map well to any of the acquisition functions we initially
consider; these subjects tend to exhibit exploration preferences beyond that of standard acquisition
functions to capture. Guided by the model discrepancies, we augment the candidate acquisition
functions to yield a superior fit to the human behavior in this task.

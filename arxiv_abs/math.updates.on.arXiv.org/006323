Recent enhancements in neuroscience, like the development of new and powerful recording techniques
of the brain activity combined with the increasing anatomical knowledge provided by atlases and
the growing understanding of neuromodulation principles, allow studying the brain at a whole new
level, paving the way to the creation of extremely detailed effective network models directly from
observed data. Leveraging the advantages of this integrated approach, we propose a method to infer
models capable of reproducing the complex spatio-temporal dynamics of the slow waves observed
in the experimental recordings of the cortical hemisphere of a mouse under anesthesia. To reliably
claim the good match between data and simulations, we implemented a versatile ensemble of analysis
tools, applicable to both experimental and simulated data and capable to identify and quantify
the spatio-temporal propagation of waves across the cortex. In order to reproduce the observed
slow wave dynamics, we introduced an inference procedure composed of two steps: the inner and the
outer loop. In the inner loop, the parameters of a mean-field model are optimized by likelihood maximization,
exploiting the anatomical knowledge to define connectivity priors. The outer loop explores "external"
parameters, seeking for an optimal match between the simulation outcome and the data, relying on
observables (speed, directions, and frequency of the waves) apt for the characterization of cortical
slow waves; the outer loop includes a periodic neuro-modulation for better reproduction of the
experimental recordings. We show that our model is capable to reproduce most of the features of the
non-stationary and non-linear dynamics displayed by the biological network. Also, the proposed
method allows to infer which are the relevant modifications of parameters when the brain state changes,
e.g. according to anesthesia levels.

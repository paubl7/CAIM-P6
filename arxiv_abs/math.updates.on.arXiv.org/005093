We show that an $\infty$-category $\mathcal{M}$ left tensored over a monoidal $\infty$-category
$\mathcal{V}$ is completely determined by its graph $$\mathcal{M}^\simeq \times \mathcal{M}^\simeq
\to \mathcal{P}(\mathcal{V}), \ (\mathrm{X},\mathrm{Y}) \mapsto \mathcal{M}((-)\otimes\mathrm{X},\mathrm{Y}),$$
parametrized by the maximal subspace $\mathcal{M}^\simeq$ in $\mathcal{M}$, equipped with the
structure of an enrichment in the sense of Gepner-Haugseng in the Day-convolution monoidal structure
on the $\infty$-category $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{V})$ of presheaves on $\mathcal{V}.$ Precisely,
we prove that sending an $\infty$-category left tensored over $\mathcal{V}$ to its graph defines
an equivalence between $\infty$-categories left tensored over $\mathcal{V}$ and a subcategory
of all $\infty$-categories enriched in presheaves on $\mathcal{V}.$ More generally we consider
a generalization of $\infty$-categories left tensored over $\mathcal{V}$, which Lurie calls
$\infty$-categories pseudo-enriched in $\mathcal{V}$, and extend the former equivalence to
an equivalence $\chi$ between $\infty$-categories pseudo-enriched in $\mathcal{V}$ and all
$\infty$-categories enriched in presheaves on $\mathcal{V}.$ The equivalence $\chi$ identifies
$\mathcal{V}$-enriched $\infty$-categories in the sense of Lurie with $\mathcal{V}$-enriched
$\infty$-categories in the sense of Gepner-Haugseng. Moreover if $\mathcal{V}$ is symmetric
monoidal, we prove that sending an $\infty$-category left tensored over $\mathcal{V}$ to its graph
is lax symmetric monoidal with respect to the relative tensorproduct on $\infty$-categories left
tensored over $\mathcal{V}$ and the canonical tensorproduct on $\mathcal{P}(\mathcal{V})$-enriched
$\infty$-categories.

Extremely large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (XL-MIMO) with hybrid precoding is a
promising technique to meet the high data rate requirements for future 6G communications. To realize
efficient hybrid precoding, it is essential to obtain accurate channel state information. Existing
channel estimation algorithms with low pilot overhead heavily rely on the channel sparsity in the
angle domain, which is achieved by the classical far-field planar wavefront assumption. However,
due to the non-negligible near-field spherical wavefront property in XL-MIMO systems, this channel
sparsity in the angle domain is not available anymore, and thus existing far-field channel estimation
schemes will suffer from severe performance loss. To address this problem, in this paper we study
the near-field channel estimation by exploiting the polar-domain sparse representation of the
near-field XL-MIMO channel. Specifically, unlike the classical angle-domain representation
that only considers the angle information of the channel, we propose a new polar-domain representation,
which simultaneously accounts for both the angle and distance information. In this way, the near-field
channel also exhibits sparsity in the polar domain. By exploiting the channel sparsity in the polar
domain, we propose the on-grid and off-grid near-field channel estimation schemes for XL-MIMO.
Firstly, an on-grid polar-domain simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (P-SOMP) algorithm
is proposed to efficiently estimate the near-field channel. Furthermore, to solve the resolution
limitation of the on-grid P-SOMP algorithm, an off-grid polar-domain simultaneous iterative
gridless weighted (P-SIGW) algorithm is proposed to improve the estimation accuracy, where the
parameters of the near-field channel are directly estimated. Finally, numerical results are provided
to verify the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

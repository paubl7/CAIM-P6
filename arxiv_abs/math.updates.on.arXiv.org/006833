We study stochastic team (known also as decentralized stochastic control or identical interest
stochastic dynamic game) problems with large or countably infinite number of decision makers,
and characterize existence and structural properties for (globally) optimal policies. We consider
both static and dynamic non-convex team problems where the cost function and dynamics satisfy an
exchangeability condition. To arrive at existence and structural results on optimal policies,
we first introduce a topology on control policies, which involves various relaxations given the
decentralized information structure. This is then utilized to arrive at a de Finetti type representation
theorem for exchangeable policies. This leads to a representation theorem for policies which admit
an infinite exchangeability condition. For a general setup of stochastic team problems with $N$
decision makers, under exchangeability of observations of decision makers and the cost function,
we show that without loss of global optimality, the search for optimal policies can be restricted
to those that are $N$-exchangeable. Then, by extending $N$-exchangeable policies to infinitely-exchangeable
ones, establishing a convergence argument for the induced costs, and using the presented de Finetti
type theorem, we establish the existence of an optimal decentralized policy for static and dynamic
teams with countably infinite number of decision makers, which turns out to be symmetric (i.e.,
identical) and randomized. In particular, unlike prior work, convexity of the cost in policies
is not assumed. Finally, we show near optimality of symmetric independently randomized policies
for finite $N$-decision maker team problems and thus establish approximation results for $N$-decision
maker weakly coupled stochastic teams.

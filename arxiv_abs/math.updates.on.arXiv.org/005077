When the spatial dimension $n =2$, it has been well-known that a global mild solution to classical
Patlak-Keller-Segel equation (PKS equation for short) exists if and only if its initial total mass
is not in supercritical regime. However, to study long-time behavior of a global mild solution to
$2$D PKS equation usually requires finite-free-energy and finite-second-moment assumptions
on initial data. In this article, we introduce a novel argument to push and stretch a space-time strip.
By this way, we gain $L^1$-compactness of PKS equation expressed under similarity variables. As
a consequence, we obtain global dynamics of 2D PKS equation in subcritical regime with no additional
assumptions. As for the higher dimensional case in which the spatial dimension $n \geq 3$, we also
characterize the long-time asymptotics of global mild solutions to PKS equation. With a finite-total-mass
assumption on density of cells, any global mild solution to PKS equation will approach a self-similar
profile when time is large, provided that there is a sequence of time going to infinity on which $L^\infty$-norm
of the density of cells converges to zero. The self-similar profile in the higher dimensional case
is given by the function $M\mathcal{G}_n$, where $M$ is the total mass of cells and $\mathcal{G}_n$
denotes the standard $n$-dimensional Gaussian probability density. Convergence rates to self-similar
profiles are also discussed in any dimensions. Particularly in the higher dimensional case, the
general convergence rate for $L^1$-initial data can be improved if the initial data has a finite
second moment. In fact, when time is large and $n \geq 3$, we provide, in an optimal way, a higher-order
approximation of global mild solutions to PKS equation if the initial density has a finite second
moment. All convergence rates studied in this article are under the $L^p$-norm with $p \in [1,\infty]$.

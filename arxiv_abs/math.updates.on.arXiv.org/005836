In the existing theoretical physics there are too many principles and postulates, which are independent
of each other. It is an important problem that how to find out some mathematical structures more essential
to minimize the number of principles and postulates. This paper proposes a solution to this problem,
based on an affine connection representation of gauge fields. There are two ways to unify gravitational
field and gauge field. One is to represent gravitational field as principal bundle connection,
and the other is to represent gauge field as affine connection. Poincare gauge theory and metric-affine
gauge theory both adopt the first approach. This paper adopts the second. We show a generalization
of Riemannian geometry and a new affine connection, and apply them to establishing a unified coordinate
description of gauge field and gravitational field. It has the following advantages. (1)Gauge
field and gravitational field have the same affine connection representation, and can be described
by the same spacial frame. (2)Chiral asymmetry, coupling constants, MNS mixing and CKM mixing appear
spontaneously in affine connection representation, while in $U(1)\times SU(2)\times SU(3)$
principal bundle connection representation they are just only artificially set up. (3)Time is
regarded as the total metric with respect to all dimensions of internal coordinate space and external
coordinate space. On-shell is regarded as gradient direction. Quantum theory is regarded as a geometric
theory of distribution of gradient directions. Hence, gravitational theory and quantum theory
obtain the same view of time and space and a unified description of evolution. (4)Many principles,
postulates and artificially introduced equations of fundamental physics and Standard Model are
turned into theorems, which mathematically and logically originate from a unique fundamental
axiom at a deeper level.

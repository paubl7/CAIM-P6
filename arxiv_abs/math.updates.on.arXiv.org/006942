This paper develops high-order accurate entropy stable (ES) adaptive moving mesh finite difference
schemes for the two- and three-dimensional special relativistic hydrodynamic (RHD) and magnetohydrodynamic
(RMHD) equations, which is the high-order accurate extension of [J.M. Duan and H.Z. Tang, Entropy
stable adaptive moving mesh schemes for 2D and 3D special relativistic hydrodynamics, J. Comput.
Phys., 426(2021), 109949]. The key point is the derivation of the higher-order accurate entropy
conservative (EC) and ES finite difference schemes in the curvilinear coordinates by carefully
dealing with the discretization of the temporal and spatial metrics and the Jacobian of the coordinate
transformation and constructing the high-order EC and ES fluxes with the discrete metrics. The
spatial derivatives in the source terms of the symmetrizable RMHD equations and the geometric conservation
laws are discretized by using the linear combinations of the corresponding second-order case to
obtain high-order accuracy. Based on the proposed high-order accurate EC schemes and the high-order
accurate dissipation terms built on the WENO reconstruction, the high-order accurate ES schemes
are obtained for the RHD and RMHD equations in the curvilinear coordinates. The mesh iteration redistribution
or adaptive moving mesh strategy is built on the minimization of the mesh adaption functional. Several
numerical tests are conducted to validate the shock-capturing ability and high efficiency of our
high-order accurate ES adaptive moving mesh methods on the parallel computer system with the MPI
communication. The numerical results show that the high-order accurate ES adaptive moving mesh
schemes outperform both their counterparts on the uniform mesh and the second-order ES adaptive
moving mesh schemes.

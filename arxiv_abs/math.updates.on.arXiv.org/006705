In this paper, we consider the sharp interface limit of a matrix-valued Allen-Cahn equation, which
takes the form: $$\partial_t A=\Delta A-\varepsilon^{-2}( A A^{\mathrm{T}}A- A)~~\text{with}~~A:\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^m\to\mathbb{R}^{n\times
n}.$$ We show that the sharp interface system is a two-phases flow system: the interface evolves
according to the motion by mean curvature; in the two bulk phase regions, the solution obeys the heat
flow of harmonic maps with values in $O^+(n)$ and $O^-(n)$ (represent the sets of $n\times n$ orthogonal
matrices with determinant $+1$ and $-1$ respectively); on the interface, the phase matrices in
two sides satisfy a novel mixed boundary condition. The above result provides a solution to the Keller-Rubinstein-Sternberg's
(conjecture) problem in this $O(n)$ setting. Our proof relies on two key ingredients. First, in
order to construct the approximate solution by matched asymptotic expansions as the standard approach
does not seem to work, we introduce the notion of quasi-minimal connecting orbits. They satisfy
the usual leading order equations up to some small higher order terms. In addition, the linearized
systems around these quasi-minimal orbits needs to be solvable up to some good remainders. These
flexibilities are needed for the possible "degenerations" or higher dimensional kernels for the
linearized operators due to intriguing boundary conditions at the sharp interface. The second
key point is to establish a spectral uniform lower bound estimate for the linearized operator around
approximate solutions. To this end, we introduce additional decompositions to reduce the problem
into the coercive estimates of several linearized operators for scalar functions and some singular
product estimates which is accomplished by exploring special cancellation structures between
eigenfunctions of these linearized operators.

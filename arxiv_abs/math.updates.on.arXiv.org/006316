For a system consisting of a quantum emitter coupled near threshold (band edge) to a one-dimensional
continuum with a van Hove singularity in the density of states, we demonstrate general conditions
such that a characteristic triple level convergence occurs directly on the threshold as the coupling
$g$ is shut off. For small $g$ values the eigenvalue and norm of each of these states can be expanded
in a Puiseux expansion in terms of powers of $g^{2/3}$, which suggests the influence of a third-order
exceptional point. However, in the actual $g \rightarrow 0$ limit, only two discrete states in fact
coalesce as the system can be reduced to a $2 \times 2$ Jordan block; the third state instead merges
with the continuum. Moreover, the decay width of the resonance state involved in this convergence
is significantly enhanced compared to the usual Fermi golden rule, which is consistent with the
Purcell effect. However, non-Markovian dynamics due to the branch-point effect are also enhanced
near the threshold. Applying a perturbative analysis in terms of the Puiseux expansion that takes
into account the threshold influence, we show that the combination of these effects results in quantum
emitter decay of the unusual form $1 - C t^{3/2}$ on the key timescale during which most of the decay
occurs. We then present two conditions that must be satisfied at the threshold for the anomalous
exceptional point to occur: the density of states must contain an inverse square-root divergence
and the potential must be non-singular. We further show that when the energy of the quantum emitter
is detuned from threshold, the anomalous exceptional point splits into three ordinary exceptional
points, two of which appear in the complex-extended parameter space. These results provide deeper
insight into a well-known problem in spontaneous decay at a photonic band edge.

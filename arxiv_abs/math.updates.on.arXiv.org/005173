Consider the characteristic initial value problem for the Einstein vacuum equations without any
symmetry assumptions. Impose a sequence of data on two intersecting null hypersurfaces, each of
which is foliated by spacelike $2$-spheres. Assume that the sequence of data is such that the derivatives
of the metrics along null directions are only uniformly bounded in $L^2$ but the derivatives of the
metrics along the directions tangential to the $2$-spheres obey higher regularity bounds uniformly.
By the results in [J. Luk and I. Rodnianski, Nonlinear interaction of impulsive gravitational waves
for the vacuum Einstein equations, Camb. J. Math. 5(4), 2017], it follows that the sequence of characteristic
initial value problems gives rise to a sequence of vacuum spacetimes $(\mathcal M, g_n)$ in a fixed
double-null domain $\mathcal M$. Since the existence theorem requires only very low regularity,
the sequence of solutions may exhibit both oscillations and concentrations, and the limit need
not be vacuum. We prove nonetheless that, after passing to a subsequence, the metrics converge in
$C^0$ and weakly in $W^{1,2}$ to a solution of the Einstein-null dust system with two families of
(potentially measure-valued) null dust. We show moreover that all sufficiently regular solutions
to the Einstein-null dust system (with potentially measure-valued null dust) adapted to a double
null coordinate system arise locally as weak limits of solutions to the Einstein vacuum system in
the manner described above. As a consequence, we also give the first general local existence and
uniqueness result for solutions to the Einstein-null dust system for which the null dusts are only
measures. This in particular includes as a special case solutions featuring propagating and interacting
shells of null dust.

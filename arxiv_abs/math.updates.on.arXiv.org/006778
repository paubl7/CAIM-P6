We investigate the potential added value of being able to relocate production capacity, relative
to fixed production capacity, in a network of multiple, geographically distributed manufacturing
sites. There is a growing interest in production capacity that can be geographically relocated;
e.g., modular units for pharmaceutical intermediates. It shows promise for enabling the fast fulfillment
of a distributed network with a reduction in the total inventory and total production capacity of
a distributed network with fixed production capacity without sacrificing customer service levels
or total system resilience. Allowing also for transshipment, we model a production-inventory
system with L production sites and Y units of relocatable production capacity, develop efficient
and effective heuristic solution methods for dynamic relocation and multi-location inventory
control, and analyze the potential added value. We describe the (L, Y) problem as a problem of sequential
decision making under uncertainty to determine transshipment, mobile production capacity relocation,
and replenishment decisions at each decision epoch. To enhance model realism, we use a partially
observed stochastic process, the modulation process, to model the exogenous and partially observable
forces (e.g., the macro-economy) that affect demand. We then model the (L, Y) problem as a partially
observed Markov decision process. Due to the considerable computational challenges of solving
this model exactly, we propose two efficient, high quality heuristics. We show for an instance set
with five locations that production capacity mobility and transshipment, relative to the fixed
production capacity case, can improve systems performance by as much as 41\% on average over the
no-flexibility case and that production capacity mobility can yield as much as 10\% more savings
compared to when only transshipment is permitted.

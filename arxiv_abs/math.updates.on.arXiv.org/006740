This paper develops an efficient procedure for designing low-complexity codebooks for precoding
in a full-dimension (FD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with a uniform planar array
(UPA) antenna at the transmitter (Tx) using tensor learning. In particular, instead of using statistical
channel models, we utilize a model-free data-driven approach with foundations in machine learning
to generate codebooks that adapt to the surrounding propagation conditions. We use a tensor representation
of the FD-MIMO channel and exploit its properties to design quantized version of the channel precoders.
We find the best representation of the optimal precoder as a function of Kronecker Product (KP) of
two low-dimensional precoders, respectively corresponding to the horizontal and vertical dimensions
of the UPA, obtained from the tensor decomposition of the channel. We then quantize this precoder
to design product codebooks such that an average loss in mutual information due to quantization
of channel state information (CSI) is minimized. The key technical contribution lies in exploiting
the constraints on the precoders to reduce the product codebook design problem to an unsupervised
clustering problem on a Cartesian Product Grassmann manifold (CPM), where the cluster centroids
form a finite-sized precoder codebook. This codebook can be found efficiently by running a $K$-means
clustering on the CPM. With a suitable induced distance metric on the CPM, we show that the construction
of product codebooks is equivalent to finding the optimal set of centroids on the factor manifolds
corresponding to the horizontal and vertical dimensions. Simulation results are presented to
demonstrate the capability of the proposed design criterion in learning the codebooks and the attractive
performance of the designed codebooks.

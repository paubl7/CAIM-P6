An $(n,r,h,a,q)$-Local Reconstruction Code is a linear code over $\mathbb{F}_q$ of length $n$,
whose codeword symbols are partitioned into $n/r$ local groups each of size $r$. Each local group
satisfies `$a$' local parity checks to recover from `$a$' erasures in that local group and there
are further $h$ global parity checks to provide fault tolerance from more global erasure patterns.
Such an LRC is Maximally Recoverable (MR), if it offers the best blend of locality and global erasure
resilience -- namely it can correct all erasure patterns whose recovery is information-theoretically
feasible given the locality structure (these are precisely patterns with up to `$a$' erasures in
each local group and an additional $h$ erasures anywhere in the codeword). Random constructions
can easily show the existence of MR LRCs over very large fields, but a major algebraic challenge is
to construct MR LRCs, or even show their existence, over smaller fields, as well as understand inherent
lower bounds on their field size. We give an explicit construction of $(n,r,h,a,q)$-MR LRCs with
field size $q$ bounded by $\left(O\left(\max\{r,n/r\}\right)\right)^{\min\{h,r-a\}}$. This
improves upon known constructions in many relevant parameter ranges. Moreover, it matches the
lower bound from Gopi et al. (2020) in an interesting range of parameters where $r=\Theta(\sqrt{n})$,
$r-a=\Theta(\sqrt{n})$ and $h$ is a fixed constant with $h\le a+2$, achieving the optimal field
size of $\Theta_{h}(n^{h/2}).$ Our construction is based on the theory of skew polynomials. We
believe skew polynomials should have further applications in coding and complexity theory; as
a small illustration we show how to capture algebraic results underlying list decoding folded Reed-Solomon
and multiplicity codes in a unified way within this theory.

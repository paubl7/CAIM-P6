A challenge arising from the local Bayesian assimilation of data in an atmospheric flow simulation
is the imbalances it may introduce. Acoustic fast-mode imbalances of the order of the slower dynamics
can be negated by employing a blended numerical model with seamless access to the compressible and
the soundproof pseudo-incompressible dynamics. Here, the blended modelling strategy by Benacchio
et al., MWR, vol. 142 (2014) is upgraded in an advanced numerical framework and extended with a Bayesian
local ensemble data assimilation method. Upon assimilation of data, the model configuration is
switched to the pseudo-incompressible regime for one time-step. After that, the model configuration
is switched back to the compressible model for the duration of the assimilation window. The switching
between model regimes is repeated for each subsequent assimilation window. An improved blending
strategy for the numerical model ensures that a single time-step in the pseudo-incompressible
regime is sufficient to suppress imbalances coming from the initialisation and data assimilation.
This improvement is based on three innovations: (i) the association of pressure fields computed
at different stages of the numerical integration with actual time levels; (ii) a conversion of pressure-related
variables between the model regimes derived from low Mach number asymptotics; and (iii) a judicious
selection of the pressure variables used in converting numerical model states when a switch of models
occurs. Idealised two-dimensional travelling vortex and buoyancy-driven bubble convection
experiments show that acoustic imbalances arising from data assimilation can be eliminated by
using this blended model, thereby achieving balanced analysis fields.

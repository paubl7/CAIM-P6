We consider the thin-film equation $\partial_t h + \partial_y \left(m(h) \partial_y^3 h\right)
= 0$ in $\{h > 0\}$ with partial-wetting boundary conditions and inhomogeneous mobility of the form
$m(h) = h^3+\lambda^{3-n}h^n$, where $h \ge 0$ is the film height, $\lambda > 0$ is the slip length,
$y > 0$ denotes the lateral variable, and $n \in (0,3)$ is the mobility exponent parameterizing the
nonlinear slip condition. The partial-wetting regime implies the boundary condition $\partial_y
h = \mathrm{const.} > 0$ at the triple junction $\partial\{h > 0\}$ (nonzero microscopic contact
angle). Existence and uniqueness of traveling-wave solutions to this problem under the constraint
$\partial_y^2 h \to 0$ as $h \to \infty$ have been proved in previous work by Chiricotto and Giacomelli
in [Commun. Appl. Ind. Math., 2(2):e-388, 16, 2011]. We are interested in the asymptotics as $h \downarrow
0$ and $h \to \infty$. By reformulating the problem as $h \downarrow 0$ as a dynamical system for the
error between the solution and the microscopic contact angle, values for $n$ are found for which
linear as well as nonlinear resonances occur. These resonances lead to a different asymptotic behavior
of the solution as $h\downarrow0$ depending on $n$. Together with the asymptotics as $h\to\infty$
characterizing Tanner's law for the velocity-dependent macroscopic contact angle as found by
Giacomelli, the first author of this work, and Otto in [Nonlinearity, 29(9):2497-2536, 2016],
the rigorous asymptotics of the traveling-wave solution to the thin-film equation in partial wetting
can be characterized. Furthermore, our approach enables us to analyze the relation between the
microscopic and macroscopic contact angle. It is found that Tanner's law for the macroscopic contact
angle depends continuously differentiably on the microscopic contact angle.

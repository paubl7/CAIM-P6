We consider the strongly connected components (SCCs) of a uniform directed graph on $n$ vertices
with i.i.d. degree tuples distributed as $(D^-,D^+)$, with $\mathbb{E}[D^+]=\mathbb{E}[D^-]=\mu$.
We condition on the total in-degree and total out-degree to be equal. A phase transition for the emergence
of a giant strongly connected component, that contains a positive proportion of the vertices, is
known to occur at the critical value $\mathbb{E}[D^-D^+]/\mu=1$. We study the model at this critical
value, and also require that $\mathbb{E}[(D^-)^i(D^+)^j]<\infty$ for all $i+j\leq 3$, and for
$(i,j)=(1,3)$, or $(i,j)=(3,1)$. We show that, under these conditions, the strongly connected
components ranked by decreasing size and rescaled by $n^{-1/3}$, converge in distribution to a
sequence of finite strongly connected directed multigraphs with edge lengths which are either
$3$-regular or loops. The limit objects are in a $3$-parameter family, which contains the scaling
limit of the SCCs in the directed Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi model at criticality as found by Goldschmidt
and Stephenson (2019). This the first universality result on directed graph models. Moreover,
it is the first result on the directed configuration model at criticality. As a trivial consequence,
the largest strongly connected components at criticality contain $O(n^{1/3})$ vertices with
high probability, and the diameter of the directed graph at criticality is $\Omega(n^{1/3})$ with
high probability; two results that were previously unknown. We use a metric on the space of such multigraphs
in which two multigraphs are close if there are compatible isomorphisms between their vertex and
edge sets which roughly preserves the edge lengths. We use the product topology on the sequence of
multigraphs. Our method involves depth-first exploration of the directed graph, resulting in
a spanning forest, of which we study the limit under rescaling.

We consider the problem of detecting an elevated mean on an interval with unknown location and length
in the univariate Gaussian sequence model. Recent results have shown that using scale-dependent
critical values for the scan statistic allows to attain asymptotically optimal detection simultaneously
for all signal lengths, thereby improving on the traditional scan, but this procedure has been criticized
for losing too much power for short signals. We explain this discrepancy by showing that these asymptotic
optimality results will necessarily be too imprecise to discern the performance of scan statistics
in a practically relevant way, even in a large sample context. Instead, we propose to assess the performance
with a new finite sample criterion. We then present three calibrations for scan statistics that
perform well across a range of relevant signal lengths: The first calibration uses a particular
adjustment to the critical values and is therefore tailored to the Gaussian case. The second calibration
uses a scale-dependent adjustment to the significance levels and is therefore applicable to arbitrary
known null distributions. The third calibration restricts the scan to a particular sparse subset
of the scan windows and then applies a weighted Bonferroni adjustment to the corresponding test
statistics. This {\sl Bonferroni scan} is also applicable to arbitrary null distributions and
in addition is very simple to implement. We show how to apply these calibrations for scanning in a
number of distributional settings: for normal observations with an unknown baseline and a known
or unknown constant variance,for observations from a natural exponential family, for potentially
heteroscadastic observations from a symmetric density by employing self-normalization in a novel
way, and for exchangeable observations using tests based on permutations, ranks or signs.

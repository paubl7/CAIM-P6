We study continuous finite element dicretizations for one dimensional hyperbolic partial differential
equations. The main contribution of the paper is to provide a fully discrete spectral analysis,
which is used to suggest optimal values of the CFL number and of the stabilization parameters involved
in different types of stabilization operators. In particular, we analyze the streamline-upwind
Petrov-Galerkin (SUPG) stabilization technique, the continuous interior penalty (CIP) stabilization
method and the local projection stabilization (LPS). Three different choices for the continuous
finite element space are compared: Bernstein polynomials, Lagrangian polynomials on equispaced
nodes, and Lagrangian polynomials on Gauss-Lobatto cubature nodes. For the last choice, we only
consider inexact quadrature based on the formulas corresponding to the degrees of freedom of the
element, which allows to obtain a fully diagonal mass matrix. We also compare different time stepping
strategies, namely Runge-Kutta (RK), strong stability preserving RK (SSPRK) and deferred correction
time integration methods. The latter allows to alleviate the computational cost as the mass matrix
inversion is replaced by the high order correction iterations. To understand the effects of these
choices, both time-continuous and fully discrete Fourier analysis are performed. These allow
to compare all the different combinations in terms of accuracy and stability, as well as to provide
suggestions for optimal values discretization parameters involved. The results are thoroughly
verified numerically both on linear and non-linear problems, and error-CPU time curves are provided.
Our final conclusions suggest that cubature elements combined with SSPRK and CIP or LPS stabilization
are the most promising combinations.

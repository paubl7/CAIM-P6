\textit{Parastichies} are spiral patterns observed in plants and numerical patterns generated
using golden angle method. Although this topic in mathematical botany has been introduced to various
fields of mathematics, the methodology and the theory have not been deeply investigated to provide
a new mathematical perspective. We generalize this method for botanical pattern formation, by
using Markoff theory %published 40 years after the work of the Bravais brothers, and the theory of
product of linear forms, to obtain a theory for (local) packing of any Riemannian manifolds of general
dimensions $n$ with a locally diagonalizable metric, including the Euclidean spaces. Our method
is based on the property of some special lattices that the density of the lattice packing maintains
a large value for any scale transformations in the directions of the standard Euclidean axes, and
utilizes maps that fulfill a system of partial differential equations. If $\sum_{i=1}^n \phi_{i}({\mathbf
x})^2 dx_i^2$ is the diagonal metric on the manifold, the case of constant $\prod_{i=1}^n \phi_{i}({\mathbf
x})$ is mainly discussed to generate uniformly distributed point sets, which is proved to be possible
for any real analytic Riemann surfaces. The packing density is bounded below by approximately 0.7.
A packing with logarithmic-spirals and a 3D analogue of the Vogel spiral are obtained as a result.
Furthermore, we provide a method to construct $(n+1)$-dimensional Riemannian manifolds with
diagonal and constant-determinant metrics from $n$-dimensional manifolds with such a metric,
which generally works for $n = 1, 2$. The obtained manifolds have the self-similarity of biological
growth characterized by increasing size without changing shape.

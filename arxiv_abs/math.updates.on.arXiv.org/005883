We consider adaptive designs for a trial involving N individuals that we follow along T time steps.
We allow for the variables of one individual to depend on its past and on the past of other individuals.
Our goal is to learn a mean outcome, averaged across the N individuals, that we would observe, if we
started from some given initial state, and we carried out a given sequence of counterfactual interventions
for $\tau$ time steps. We show how to identify a statistical parameter that equals this mean counterfactual
outcome, and how to perform inference for this parameter, while adaptively learning an oracle design
defined as a parameter of the true data generating distribution. Oracle designs of interest include
the design that maximizes the efficiency for a statistical parameter of interest, or designs that
mix the optimal treatment rule with a certain exploration distribution. We also show how to design
adaptive stopping rules for sequential hypothesis testing. This setting presents unique technical
challenges. Unlike in usual statistical settings where the data consists of several independent
observations, here, due to network and temporal dependence, the data reduces to one single observation
with dependent components. In particular, this precludes the use of sample splitting techniques.
We therefore had to develop a new equicontinuity result and guarantees for estimators fitted on
dependent data. We were motivated to work on this problem by the following two questions. (1) In the
context of a sequential adaptive trial with K treatment arms, how to design a procedure to identify
in as few rounds as possible the treatment arm with best final outcome? (2) In the context of sequential
randomized disease testing at the scale of a city, how to estimate and infer the value of an optimal
testing and isolation strategy?

We consider the problem of degradation in performance of multi-carrier multi-user massive MIMO
systems when channel induced Doppler spread is high. Recently, Orthogonal Time Frequency Space
(OTFS) modulation has been shown to be robust to channel induced Doppler spread. In OTFS based systems,
information symbols are embedded in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain where they are jointly modulated
to generate the time-domain transmit signal. Due to the multi-path delay and Doppler shifts, the
DD domain information symbols need to be jointly demodulated at the receiver. For multi-carrier
based communication (e.g., Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM)), massive MIMO
systems have been shown to achieve high spectral and energy efficiency with low complexity multi-user
precoding in the downlink. Extending the same to OTFS based downlink multi-user massive MIMO systems
is challenging due to the requirement for joint demodulation of all information symbols at the user
terminal (UT). In this paper, we solve this problem by proposing a novel OTFS based multi-user precoder
at the base station (BS) and a corresponding low complexity detector (LCD) at the user terminals
(UTs), which allows for separate demodulation of each DD domain information symbol at the UT. The
complexity of the proposed precoder increases only linearly with increasing number BS antennas
Q and the number of UTs. We show, through analysis, that as Q increases (with total transmitted power
decreased linearly with Q), the proposed low complexity detector achieves a sum SE close to that
achieved with optimal joint demodulation at each UT. Numerical simulations confirm our analysis
and also show that the SE and error rate performance of the proposed OTFS based massive MIMO precoder
and LCD detector is significantly more robust to channel induced Doppler spread when compared to
OFDM based multi-user massive MIMO systems.

We consider the stochastic heat equation $\partial_{s}u =\frac{1}{2}\Delta u +(\beta V(s,y)-\lambda)u$,
with a smooth space-time stationary Gaussian random field $V(s,y)$, in dimensions $d\geq 3$, with
an initial condition $u(0,x)=u_0(\varepsilon x)$ and a suitably chosen $\lambda\in{\mathbb
R}$. It is known that, for $\beta$ small enough, the diffusively rescaled solution $u^{\varepsilon}(t,x)=u(\varepsilon^{-2}t,\varepsilon^{-1}x)$
converges weakly to a scalar multiple of the solution $\bar u(t,x)$ of the heat equation with an effective
diffusivity $a$, and that fluctuations converge, also in a weak sense, to the solution of the Edwards-Wilkinson
equation with an effective noise strength $\nu$ and the same effective diffusivity. In this paper,
we derive a pointwise approximation $w^\varepsilon(t,x)=\bar u(t,x)\Psi^\varepsilon(t,x)+\varepsilon
u_1^\varepsilon(t,x)$, where $\Psi^\varepsilon(t,x)=\Psi(t/\varepsilon^2,x/\varepsilon)$,
$\Psi$ is a solution of the SHE with constant initial conditions, and $u^\varepsilon_1$ is an explicit
corrector. We show that $\Psi(t,x)$ converges to a stationary process $\tilde \Psi(t,x)$ as $t\to\infty$,
that $\mathbf{E}|u^\varepsilon(t,x)-w^\varepsilon(t, x)|^2$ converges pointwise to $0$ as
$\varepsilon\to 0$, and that $\varepsilon^{-d/2+1}(u^\varepsilon-w^\varepsilon)$ converges
weakly to $0$ for fixed $t$. As a consequence, we derive new representations of the diffusivity $a$
and effective noise strength $\nu$. Our approach uses a Markov chain in the space of trajectories
introduced in Gu, Ryzhik, and Zeitouni, "The Edwards-Wilkinson limit of the random heat equation
in dimensions three and higher," as well as tools from homogenization theory. The corrector $u_1^\varepsilon(t,x)$
is constructed using a seemingly new approximation scheme on a mesoscopic time scale.

By introducing extrinsic noise as well as intrinsic uncertainty into a network with stochastic
events, this paper studies the dynamics of the resulting Markov random network and characterizes
a novel phenomenon of intermittent synchronization and desynchronization that is due to an interplay
of the two forms of randomness in the system. On a finite state space and in discrete time, the network
allows for unperturbed (or "deterministic") randomness that represents the extrinsic noise but
also for small intrinsic uncertainties modelled by a Markov perturbation. It is shown that if the
deterministic random network is synchronized (resp., uniformly synchronized), then for almost
all realizations of its extrinsic noise the stochastic trajectories of the perturbed network synchronize
along almost all (resp., along all) time sequences after a certain time, with high probability.
That is, both the probability of synchronization and the proportion of time spent in synchrony are
arbitrarily close to one. Under smooth Markov perturbations, high-probability synchronization
and low-probability desynchronization occur intermittently in time, which can both be precisely
described via an asymptotic expansion of the invariant distribution. Existence and uniqueness
of invariant distributions are established, as well as their convergence as the perturbation parameter
vanishes. An explicit asymptotic expansion is derived. Ergodicity of the extrinsic noise dynamics
is seen to be crucial for the characterization of (de)synchronization sets and their respective
relative frequencies. An example of a smooth Markov perturbation of a synchronized probabilistic
Boolean network is provided to illustrate the intermittency between high-probability synchronization
and low-probability desynchronization.

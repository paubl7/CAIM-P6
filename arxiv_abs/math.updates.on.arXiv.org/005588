In this paper, we study the influence of the vortices on the fluctuations of $2d$ systems such as the
Coulomb gas, the Villain model or the integer-valued Gaussian free field. In the case of the $2d$
Villain model, we prove that the fluctuations induced by the vortices are at least of the same order
of magnitude as the ones produced by the spin-wave. We obtain the following quantitative upper-bound
on the two-point correlation in $\mathbb{Z}^2$ when $\beta>1$ $$ \langle\sigma_x \sigma_y\rangle_{\beta}^{Villain}
\leq C \, \left( \frac 1 {\|x-y\|_2}\right)^{\frac 1 {2\pi \beta}\left ( 1+\beta e^{-\frac{(2\pi)^2}{2}
\beta}\right )} $$ The proof is non-perturbative and relies on a new way of sampling the $2d$ Coulomb
gas. For the $2d$ Coulomb gas, we obtain the following lower bound on its fluctuations at high inverse
temperature $$ \mathbb{E}_{\beta}^{Coul}\left[\langle \Delta^{-1}q, g\rangle \right] \gtrsim
\exp(-\pi^2 \beta + o(\beta)) \langle g,(-\Delta)^{-1}g\rangle $$ This estimate coincides with
the predictions based on a RG analysis from \cite{Kadanoff} and suggests that the Coulomb potential
$\Delta^{-1}q$ at inverse temperature $\beta$ should scale like a Gaussian free field of inverse
temperature of order $\exp(\pi^2 \beta)$. Finally, we transfer the above vortex fluctuations
via a duality identity to the integer-valued GFF by showing that its maximum deviates in a quantitative
way from the maximum of a usual GFF. More precisely, we show that with high probability when $\beta>1$
$$ \max_{x\in [-n,n]^2} \phi_n^{IV} \leq \sqrt{\frac{2\beta}{\pi} \big(1 - \beta e^{- \frac{(2\pi)^2\beta}
{2} } \big)} \log n \,. $$ where $\phi_n$ is an integer-valued GFF in the box $[-n,n]^2$ at inverse
temperature $\beta^{-1}$. Applications to the free-energies of the Coulomb gas, the Villain model
and the integer-valued GFF are also considered.

In the existing theoretical physics there are too many principles and postulates, which are independent
of each other. It is an important problem that how to find some physical laws that are more essential
to minimize the number of principles and postulates. This paper proposes a solution to this problem.
First, we show a generalization of the intrinsic differential geometry, thus the Riemannian geometry
becomes its subgeometry. In this geometry there exists a new connection, which reflects some more
intrinsic properties of differentiable manifold than the Levi-Civita connection. These properties
are closely related to gauge fields and elementary particles. Then, we apply such a generalized
intrinsic geometry to establishing a new framework for the unification of fundamental physics.
(1)Many principles, postulates and artificially introduced equations of fundamental physics
are turned into theorems based on a unique fundamental axiom, so they obtain a common origination
at a deeper level. (2)It is proposed that time should be regarded as the total metric with respect
to all internal and external spacial dimensions, and the actual evolution should be regarded as
a gradient direction field, and the quantum theory should be regarded as a theory of distribution
of gradient directions. The above ideas make the gravitational theory and the quantum theory become
coordinated, so they have the same view of time and space and a unified description of evolution.
(3)The generalized intrinsic geometry makes gravitational field and gauge field unified into
the same coordinate representation. (4)The generalized intrinsic geometry makes gauge field
and elementary particle field originate from the same geometric construction at a deeper level.
Many postulates of the Standard Model are turned into theorems in the new framework, so they are not
necessary to be regarded as postulates anymore.

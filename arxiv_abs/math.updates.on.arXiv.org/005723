This paper deals with the classical solution of following chemotaxis system with indirect signal
production \begin{eqnarray*} \left\{ \begin{array}{llll} u_t=\epsilon\Delta u-\chi\nabla\cdot(u\nabla
v)+ru-\mu u^\theta, &x\in \Omega,\ t>0,\\ \tau_1v_t=d_1\Delta v-\alpha v+\beta w, &x\in \Omega,\
t>0,\\ \tau_2w_t = d_2\Delta w-\gamma w+\lambda u, &x\in \Omega,\ t>0, \end{array} \right. \end{eqnarray*}
in arbitrary bounded domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb{R}^n$, $n\geq1$, where $\chi, r, \mu, d_1,
\alpha, \beta, \gamma, \lambda>0$ and $\theta>1$. Let $M$ be an arbitrary positive constant, (i)
for $\epsilon\in(0, 1), d_2>0$ and $\tau_1=\tau_2=0$, if the initial data is suitably large, or
$\mu$ is appropriately small such that $\|u_0\|_{L^\theta(\Omega)}^{\frac{\theta+1}{\theta}}>C_0(1+\mu)$,
where $C_0$ is a positive constant which depends on the parameters and $n, \Omega, M$ but not on $\mu$,
then for the associated solution of system and any positive constant $M$, one can find some points
such that \begin{equation}\label{xzs} u(\tilde{x}, \tilde{t})>M. \end{equation} (ii) for
$\epsilon, \tau_1, \tau_2>0, d_2\geq0$ and $\theta\in(1, \theta_0)$, here $\theta_0$ is a constant.
If $\mu$ is appropriately small or $u_0$ and $v_0$ are suitable lager such that $\mathcal {F}(u_0,
v_0)\leq-K(\mu\theta+1)$, where $K$ is a positive constant which depends on the parameters and
$n, \Omega, M$ but not on $\mu$ and $\theta$, $\mathcal {F}$ is the Lyapunov functional to the system
without damping source $ru-\mu u^\theta$, then \eqref{xzs} still holds. Our results extend greatly
the existing knowledge for relevant model, therein the classical Keller-Segel growth systems
were considered and the radially symmetric assumptions on $\Omega$ and initial data were necessary.

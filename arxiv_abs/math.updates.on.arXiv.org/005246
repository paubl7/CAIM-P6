Research on infodemics, i.e., the rapid spread of (mis)information related to a hazardous event,
such as the COVID-19 pandemic, requires the integration of a multiplicity of scientific disciplines.
The dynamics emerging from infodemics have the potential to generate complex behavioral patterns.
In order to react appropriately, it is of ultimate importance for the fields of Business and Economics
to understand the dynamics emerging from it. In the short run, dynamics might lead to an adaptation
in household spending or to a shift in buying behavior towards online providers. In the long run,
changes in investments, consumer behavior, and markets are to be expected. We argue that the dynamics
emerge from complex interactions among multiple factors, such as information and misinformation
accessible for individuals and the formation and revision of beliefs. (Mis)information accessible
to individuals is, amongst others, affected by algorithms specifically designed to provide personalized
information, while automated fact-checking algorithms can help reduce the amount of circulating
misinformation. The formation and revision of individual (and probably false) beliefs and individual
fact-checking and interpretation of information are heavily affected by linguistic patterns
inherent to information during pandemics and infodemics and further factors, such as affect, intuition
and motives. We argue that, in order to get a deep(er) understanding of the dynamics emerging from
infodemics, the fields of Business and Economics should integrate the perspectives of Computer
Science and Information Systems, (Computational) Linguistics, and Cognitive Science into the
wider context of economic systems (e.g., organizations, markets or industries) and propose a way
to do so.

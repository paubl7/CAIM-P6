In formal concept analysis, the collection of protoconcepts of any context forms a double Boolean
algebra (dBa) which is fully contextual. Semiconcepts of a context form a pure dBa. The present article
is a study on topological representation results for dBas, and in particular, those for fully contextual
and pure dBas. In this work, a context on topological spaces (CTS) is considered, and the focus is
on a special kind of CTS in which the relation defining the context as well as the converse of the relation
are continuous with respect to the topologies. Such CTS are denoted as CTSCR. It is observed that
clopen object oriented protoconcepts of a CTSCR form a fully contextual dBa, while clopen object
oriented semiconcepts form a pure dBa. Every dBa is shown to be quasi-embeddable into the dBa of clopen
object oriented protoconcepts of a particular CTSCR. The quasi-embedding turns into an embedding
in case of a contextual dBa, and into an isomorphism, when the dBa is fully contextual. For pure dBas,
one obtains an isomorphism with the algebra of clopen object oriented semiconcepts of the CTSCR.
Representation of finite dBas and Boolean algebras are also addressed in the process. Abstraction
of properties of this CTSCR leads to the definition of Stone contexts. Stone contexts and CTSCR-
homeomorphisms are seen to form a category, denoted Scxt. Furthermore, correspondences are observed
between dBa isomorphisms and CTSCR-homeomorphisms. This motivates a study of categorical duality
of dBas, constituting the second part of the article. Pure dBas and fully contextual dBas along with
dBa isomorphisms form categories, denoted PDBA and FCDBA respectively. It is established that
PDBA is equivalent to FCDBA, while FCDBA and PDBA are dually equivalent to Scxt.

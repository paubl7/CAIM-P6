In late 2019, a novel coronavirus, the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak was identified in Wuhan, China and later
spread to every corner of the globe. Whilst the number of infection-induced deaths in Ghana, West
Africa are minimal when compared with the rest of the world, the impact on the local health service
is still significant. Compartmental models are a useful framework for investigating transmission
of diseases in societies. To understand how the infection will spread and how to limit the outbreak.
We have developed a modified SEIR compartmental model with nine compartments (CoVCom9) to describe
the dynamics of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in Ghana. We have carried out a detailed mathematical analysis
of the CoVCom9, including the derivation of the basic reproduction number, $\mathcal{R}_{0}$.
In particular, we have shown that the disease-free equilibrium is globally asymptotically stable
when $\mathcal{R}_{0}<1$ via a candidate Lyapunov function. Using the SARS-CoV-2 reported data
for confirmed-positive cases and deaths from March 13 to August 10, 2020, we have parametrised the
CoVCom9 model. The results of this fit show good agreement with data. We used Latin hypercube sampling-rank
correlation coefficient (LHS-PRCC) to investigate the uncertainty and sensitivity of $\mathcal{R}_{0}$
since the results derived are significant in controlling the spread of SARS-CoV-2. We estimate
that over this five month period, the basic reproduction number is given by $\mathcal{R}_{0} = 3.110$,
with the 95\% confidence interval being $2.042 \leq \mathcal{R}_0 \leq 3.240$, and the mean value
being $\mathcal{R}_{0}=2.623$. Of the 32 parameters in the model, we find that just six have a significant
influence on $\mathcal{R}_{0}$, these include the rate of testing, where an increasing testing
rate contributes to the reduction of $\mathcal{R}_{0}$.

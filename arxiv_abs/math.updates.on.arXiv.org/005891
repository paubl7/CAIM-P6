In this paper, we study various aspects of the ODE's flow $X$ solution to the equation $\partial_t
X(t,x)=b(X(t,x))$, $X(0,x)=x$ in the $d$-dimensional torus $Y_d$, where $b$ is a regular $\mathbb{Z}^d$-periodic
vector field from $\mathbb{R}^d$ in $\mathbb{R}^d$.We present an original and complete picture
in any dimension of all logical connections between the following seven conditions involving the
field $b$: (i) the everywhere asymptotics of the flow $X$, (ii) the almost-everywhere asymptotics
of the flow $X$, (iii) the global rectification of the vector field $b$ in $Y_d$, (iv) the ergodicity
of the flow related to an invariant probability measure which is absolutely continuous with respect
to Lebesgue's measure, (v) the unit set condition for Herman's rotation set $C_b$ composed of the
means of $b$ related to the invariant probability measures, (vi) the unit set condition for the subset
$D_b$ of $C_b$ composed of the means of $b$ related to the invariant probability measures which are
absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue's measure, (vii) the homogenization of the linear
transport equation with oscillating data and the oscillating velocity $b(x/\varepsilon)$ when
$b$ is divergence free. The main and surprising result of the paper is that the almost-everywhere
asymptotics of the flow $X$ and the unit set condition for $D_b$ are equivalent when $D_b$ is assumed
to be non empty, and that the two conditions turn to be equivalent to the homogenization of the transport
equation when $b$ is divergence free. In contrast, using an elementary approach based on classical
tools of PDE's analysis, we extend the two-dimensional results of Oxtoby and Marchetto to any $d$-dimensional
Stepanoff flow: this shows that the ergodicity of the flow may hold without satisfying the everywhere
asymptotics of the flow.

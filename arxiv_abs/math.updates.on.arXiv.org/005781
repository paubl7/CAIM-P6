This paper studies the benefits of autonomous vehicles in ride-sharing platforms dedicated to
serving commuting needs. It considers the Commute Trip Sharing Problem with Autonomous Vehicles
(CTSPAV), the optimization problem faced by a reservation-based platform that receives daily
commute-trip requests and serves them with a fleet of autonomous vehicles. The CTSPAV can be viewed
as a special case of the Dial- A-Ride Problem (DARP). However, this paper recognizes that commuting
trips exhibit special spatial and temporal properties that can be exploited in a branch and cut algorithm
that leverages a redundant modeling approach. In particular, the branch and cut algorithm relies
on a MIP formulation that schedules mini routes representing inbound or outbound trips. This formulation
is effective in finding high-quality solutions quickly but its relaxation is relatively weak.
To remedy this limitation, the mini-route MIP is complemented by a DARP formulation which is not
as effective in obtaining primal solutions but has a stronger relaxation. The benefits of the proposed
approach are demonstrated by comparing it with another, more traditional, exact branch and cut
procedure and a heuristic method based on mini routes. The methodological contribution is complemented
by a comprehensive analysis of a CTSPAV platform for reducing vehicle counts, travel distances,
and congestion. In particular, the case study for a medium-sized city reveals that a CTSPAV platform
can reduce daily vehicle counts by a staggering 92% and decrease vehicles miles by 30%. The platform
also significantly reduces congestion, measured as the number of vehicles on the road per unit time,
by 60% during peak times. These benefits, however, come at the expense of introducing empty miles.
Hence the paper also highlights the tradeoffs between future ride-sharing and car-pooling platforms.

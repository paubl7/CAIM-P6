A Hopf bifurcation is prevalent in many nonlinear dynamical systems. When a system prior to a Hopf
bifurcation is exposed to a sufficient level of noise, its noise-induced dynamics can provide valuable
information about the impending bifurcation. In this thesis, we present a system identification
(SI) framework that exploits the noise-induced dynamics prior to a Hopf bifurcation. The framework
is novel in that it is capable of predicting the bifurcation point and the post-bifurcation dynamics
using only pre-bifurcation data. Specifically, we present two different versions of the framework:
input-output and output-only. For the input-output version, the system is forced with additive
noise generated by an external actuator, and its response is measured. For the output-only version,
the intrinsic noise of the system acts as the noise source and only the output signal is measured.
In both versions, the Fokker-Planck equations, which describe the probability density function
of the fluctuation amplitude, are derived from self-excited oscillator models. Then, the coefficients
of these models are extracted from the experimental probability density functions characterizing
the noise-induced response in the fixed-point regime. The SI framework is tested on three different
experimental systems: a low-density jet, a flame-driven Rijke tube, and a gas-turbine combustor.
For these systems, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can identify the nature of the Hopf
bifurcation and the system's order of nonlinearity. Moreover, by extrapolating the identified
model coefficients, we are able to forecast the locations of the bifurcation points and the limit-cycle
features after those points. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that SI has been performed
using data from only the pre-bifurcation regime, without the need for knowledge of the location
of the bifurcation point.

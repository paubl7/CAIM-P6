The capacity of a discrete-time model of optical fiber described by the split-step Fourier method
(SSFM) as a function of the average input power $\mathcal P$ and the number of segments in distance
$K$ is considered. It is shown that if $K\geq \mathcal{P}^{2/3}$ and $\mathcal P\rightarrow \infty$,
the capacity of the resulting continuous-space lossless model is lower bounded by $\frac{1}{2}\log_2(1+\text{SNR})
- \frac{1}{2}+ o(1)$, where $o(1)$ tends to zero with the signal-to-noise ratio $\text{SNR}$.
As $K\rightarrow \infty$, the inter-symbol interference (ISI) averages out to zero due to the law
of large numbers and the SSFM model tends to a diagonal phase noise model. It follows that, in contrast
to the discrete-space model where there is only one signal degree-of-freedom (DoF) at high powers,
the number of DoFs in the continuous-space model is at least half of the input dimension $n$. Intensity-modulation
and direct detection achieves this rate. The pre-log in the lower bound when $K{\geq}\mathcal{P}^{1/\delta}$
is generally characterized in terms of $\delta$. The SSFM model when the dispersion matrix does
not depend on $K$ (\eg\ when the step size in distance is fixed) is considered. It is shown that the
capacity of this model when $ K= \mathcal{P}^{1/\delta}$, $\delta>3$, and $\mathcal P \rightarrow
\infty$ is $\frac{1}{2n}\log_2(1+\text{SNR})+ o(1)$. Thus, there is only one DoF in this model.
It is shown that if the nonlinearity parameter $\gamma\rightarrow \infty$, the capacity of the
continuous-space model is $\frac{1}{2}\log_2(1+\text{SNR})+ o(1)$ for any $\text{SNR}$. Finally,
it is found that the maximum achievable information rates (AIRs) of the SSFM model with back-propagation
equalization obtained using numerical simulation follows a double-ascent curve.

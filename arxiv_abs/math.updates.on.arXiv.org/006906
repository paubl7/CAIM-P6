The work in this thesis concerns the investigation of eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrix, normalized
Laplacian matrix, signless Laplacian matrix and distance signless Laplacian matrix of graphs.
In Chapter 1, we present a brief introduction of spectral graph theory with some definitions. Chapter
$2$ deals with the sum of $ k $ largest Laplacian eigenvalues $ S_{k}(G) $ of graph $ G $ and Brouwer's
conjecture. We obtain the upper bounds for $ S_{k}(G) $ for some classes of graphs and use them to verify
Brouwer's conjecture for these classes of graphs. Also, we prove Brouwer's conjecture for more
general classes of graphs. In Chapter $3$, we investigate the Laplacian eigenvalues of graphs and
the Laplacian energy conjecture for trees. We prove the Laplacian energy conjecture completely
for trees of diameter $ 4 $. Further, we prove this conjecture for all trees having at most $ \frac{9n}{25}-2
$ non-pendent vertices. Also, we obtain the sufficient conditions for the truth of conjecture for
trees of order $ n $. In Chapter $4$, we determine the normalized Laplacian spectrum of the joined
union of regular graphs and obtain the spectrum of some well known graphs. As consequences of joined
union, we obtain the normalized Laplacian spectrum of power graphs associated to finite cyclic
groups. In Chapter $5$, we find the distance signless Laplacian spectrum of regular graphs and zero-divisor
graphs associated to finite commutative ring. Also, we find the bounds for spectral radius of generalized
distance matrix. Further, we obtain the generalized distance energy for bipartite graphs and trees.
We prove that the complete bipartite graph has minimum generalized distance energy among all connected
bipartite graphs. Besides, for $ \alpha\in \big(0, \frac{2n}{3n-2}\big) $, we show that the star
graph has minimum generalized distance energy among all trees.

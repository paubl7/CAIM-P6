Roots of matrices are well-studied. The conditions for their existence are understood: The block
sizes of nilpotent Jordan blocks, arranged in pairs, have to satisfy some simple algebraic property.
More interesting are structured roots of structured matrices. Probably the best known example
is the existence and uniqueness of positive definite square roots of a positive definite matrix.
If one drops the requirement of positive definiteness of the square root, it turns out that there
exists an abundance of square roots. Here a description of all canonical forms of all square roots
is possible and is straight forward. H-nonnegative matrices are H-selfadjoint and are nonnegative
with respect to an indefinite inner product with Gramian H. An H-nonnegative matrix $B$ allows a
decomposition in a negative definite, a nilpotent H-nonnegative, and a positive definite matrix,
B=B_- \oplus B_0 \oplus B_+. The interesting part is B_0, as only Jordan blocks of size one and two
occur. Determining a square root of B reduces to determining a square root of each of B_-, B_0, and
B_+. Here we investigate for an H-nonnegative matrix: its square roots without additional structure,
as well as its structured square roots that are H-nonnegative or H-selfadjoint. For these three
classes of square roots of H-nonnegative matrices we show a simple criterion for their existence
and describe all possible canonical forms. This is based mainly on known results but an important
new part is that in all three cases we describe all possible square roots of the nilpotent H-nonnegative
matrix B_0 explicitly. Moreover, we show how our results can be applied to the conditional and unconditional
stability of H-nonnegative square roots of H-nonnegative matrices, where the explicit description
of the square roots of B_0 is used.

Multiple wireless sensing tasks, e.g., radar detection for driver safety, involve estimating
the "channel" or relationship between signal transmitted and received. In this work, we focus on
a certain channel model known as the delay-doppler channel. This model begins to be useful in the
high frequency carrier setting, which is increasingly common with developments in millimeter-wave
technology. Moreover, the delay-doppler model then continues to be applicable even when using
signals of large bandwidth, which is a standard approach to achieving high resolution channel estimation.
However, when high resolution is desirable, this standard approach results in a tension with the
desire for efficiency because, in particular, it immediately implies that the signals in play live
in a space of very high dimension $N$ (e.g., ~$10^6$ in some applications), as per the Shannon-Nyquist
sampling theorem. To address this difficulty, we propose a novel randomized estimation scheme
called Sparse Channel Estimation, or SCE for short, for channel estimation in the $k$-sparse setting
(e.g., $k$ objects in radar detection). This scheme involves an estimation procedure with sampling
and space complexity both on the order of $k(logN)^3$, and arithmetic complexity on the order of
$k(log N)^3 + k^2$, for $N$ sufficiently large. To the best of our knowledge, Sparse Channel Estimation
(SCE) is the first of its kind to achieve these complexities simultaneously -- it seems to be extremely
efficient! As an added advantage, it is a simple combination of three ingredients, two of which are
well-known and widely used, namely digital chirp signals and discrete Gaussian filter functions,
and the third being recent developments in sparse fast fourier transform algorithms.

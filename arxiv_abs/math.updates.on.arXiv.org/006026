This research is aimed at achieving an efficient digital infrastructure for evaluating risks and
damages caused by tsunami flooding. It is mainly focused on the suitable modeling of debris dynamics
for a simple (but accurate enough) assessment of damages. For different reasons including computational
performance and Big Data management issues, we focus our research on Eulerian debris flow modeling.
Rather than using complex multiphase debris models, we rather use an empirical transportation
and deposition model that takes into account the interaction with the main water flow, friction/contact
with the ground but also debris interaction. In particular, for debris interaction, we have used
ideas coming from vehicular traffic flow modeling. We introduce a velocity regularization term
similar to the so-called ``anticipation term'' in traffic flow modeling that takes into account
the local flow between neighboring debris and makes the problem mathematically well-posed. It
prevents from the generation of ``Dirac measures of debris'' at shock waves. As a result, the model
is able to capture emerging phenomenons like debris aggregation and accumulations, and possibly
to react on the main flow by creating hills of debris and make the main stream deviate. We also discuss
the way to derive quantities of interest (QoI), especially ``damage functions'' from the debris
density and momentum fields. We believe that this original unexplored debris approach can lead
to a valuable analysis of tsunami flooding damage assessment with Physics-based damage functions.
Numerical experiments show the nice behaviour of the numerical solvers, including the solution
of Saint-Venant's shallow water equations and debris dynamics equations.

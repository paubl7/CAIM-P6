This paper aims to characterize the capacity limits of a wireless cellular network with a full-duplex
(FD) base-station (BS) and half-duplex user terminals, in which three independent messages are
communicated: the uplink message $m_1$ from the uplink user to the BS, the downlink message $m_2$
from the BS to the downlink user, and the device-to-device (D2D) message $m_3$ from the uplink user
to the downlink user. From an information theoretical perspective, the overall network can be viewed
as a generalization of the FD relay broadcast channel with a side message transmitted from the relay
to the destination. We begin with a simpler case that involves the uplink and downlink transmissions
of $(m_1,m_2)$ only, and propose an achievable rate region based on a novel strategy that uses the
BS as a FD relay to facilitate the interference cancellation at the downlink user. We also prove a
new converse, which is strictly tighter than the cut-set bound, and characterize the capacity region
of the scalar Gaussian FD network without a D2D message to within a constant gap. This paper further
studies a general setup wherein $(m_1,m_2,m_3)$ are communicated simultaneously. To account
for the D2D message, we incorporate Marton's broadcast coding into the previous scheme to obtain
a larger achievable rate region than the existing ones in the literature. We also improve the cut-set
bound by means of genie and show that by using one of the two simple rate-splitting schemes, the capacity
region of the scalar Gaussian FD network with a D2D message can already be reached to within a constant
gap. Finally, a generalization to the vector Gaussian channel case is discussed. Simulation results
demonstrate the advantage of using the BS as relay in enhancing the throughput of the FD cellular
network.

Consider a parameter dependent vector field on either Euclidean space or a compact Riemannian manifold.
Suppose that it possesses a parameter dependent initial condition and a parameter dependent stable
hyperbolic equilibrium point. It is valuable to determine the set of parameter values, which we
call the recovery set, whose corresponding initial conditions lie within the region of attraction
of the corresponding stable equilibrium point. A boundary parameter value is a parameter value
whose corresponding initial condition lies in the boundary of the region of attraction of the corresponding
stable equilibrium point. Prior algorithms numerically estimated the recovery set by estimating
its boundary via computation of boundary parameter values. The primary purpose of this work is to
provide theoretical justification for those algorithms for a large class of parameter dependent
vector fields. This includes proving that, for these vector fields, the boundary of the recovery
set consists of boundary parameter values, and that the properties exploited by the algorithms
to compute these desired boundary parameters will be satisfied. The main technical result which
these proofs rely on is establishing that the region of attraction boundary varies continuously
in an appropriate sense with respect to small variation in parameter value for this class of vector
fields. Hence, the majority of this work is devoted to proving this result, which may be of independent
interest. The proof of continuity proceeds by proving that, for this class of vector fields, the
region of attraction permits a decomposition into a union of the stable manifolds of the equilibrium
points and periodic orbits it contains, and this decomposition persists under small perturbations
to the vector field.

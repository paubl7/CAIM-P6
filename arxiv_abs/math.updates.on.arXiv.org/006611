Everyday thousands of meteoroids enter the Earth's atmosphere. The vast majority burn up harmlessly
during the descent, but the larger objects survive, occasionally experiencing intense fragmentation
events, and reach the ground. These events can pose a threat for a village or a small city; therefore,
models of asteroid fragmentation, along with accurate post-breakup trajectory and strewn field
estimation, are needed to enable a reliable risk assessment. In this work, a methodology to describe
meteoroids entry, fragmentation, descent, and strewn field is presented by means of a continuum
approach. At breakup, a modified version of the NASA Standard Breakup Model is used to generate the
distribution of the fragments in terms of their area-to-mass ratio and ejection velocity. This
distribution, combined with the meteoroid state, is directly propagated using the continuity
equation coupled with the non-linear entry dynamics. At each time step, the probability density
evolution of the fragments is reconstructed using GMM interpolation. Using this information is
then possible to estimate the meteoroid's ground impact probability. This approach departs from
the current state-of-the-art models: it has the flexibility to include large fragmentation events
while maintaining a continuum formulation for a better physical representation of the phenomenon.
The methodology is also characterised by a modular structure, so that updated asteroids fragmentation
models can be readily integrated into the framework, allowing a continuously improving prediction
of re-entry and fragmentation events. The propagation of the fragments' density and its reconstruction,
currently considering only one fragmentation point, is first compared against Monte Carlo simulations,
and then against real observations. Both deceleration due to atmospheric drag and ablation due
to aerothermodynamics effects have been considered.

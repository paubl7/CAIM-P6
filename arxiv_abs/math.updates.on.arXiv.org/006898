We use the well-known Bogomolny's equations, in general coordinate system, for monopoles and dyons
in the $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs model to obtain explicit form of the BPS Lagrangian density under
the BPS Lagrangian method. We then generalize this BPS Lagrangian density and use it to derive Bogomolny's
equations for monopoles and dyons in the generalized $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills-Higgs model. We find a
relation between the scalar fields-dependent couplings similar to the one obtained in~\cite{Atmaja:2018cod}.
There are also additional constraint equations coming from the Euler-Lagrange equations of the
generalized BPS Lagrangian density, which can be considered as the Gauss's law constraint equations
in the BPS limit. In the case of monopoles, these constraint equations are trivial while for dyons
they are non-trivial. Applying the Julia-Zee ansatz to these constraint equations implies that
all scalar fields-dependent couplings must be constants, or normalized to unity, in which solutions
for the Bogomolny's equations are the standard BPS dyons. This contradicts with the one in~\cite{Atmaja:2018cod}
derived from the spherically symmetric effective Lagrangian density of the generalized $SU(2)$
Yang-Mills-Higgs model. Repeating the computations there using the correct effective Lagrangian
density, without a priori identifying the effective scalar gauge potential with the effective
scalar fields $j=\sigma f$ where $\sigma$ is a constant, and the correct effective BPS Lagrangian
density, we obtained the same result as in the general coordinate system. We propose two possible
ways for obtaining the generalized BPS dyons, in which at least one of the scalar fields-dependent
couplings is not constant, which are by taking axially symmetric ansatz for higher topological
charge dyons, and/or by using the most general BPS Lagrangian density.

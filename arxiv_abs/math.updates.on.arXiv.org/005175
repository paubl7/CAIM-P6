We develop a general approach for investigating geometric properties of Gaussian multiplicative
chaos (GMC) in an infinite dimensional set up. The notion of a GMC, which is defined by tilting a reference
measure on a metric space by exponentiating a cenetered Gaussian field, dates back to a seminal work
of Kahane [K85]. Particularly when the Gaussian field is chosen to be log-correlated and its indexing
parameter is sampled according to the (two dimensional) Lebesgue measure, the latter work has led
to a lot of rejuvenated interest in the subject during the last decade playing a determinant r\^ole
in understanding geometric properties of $2d$-Liouville quantum gravity, thick points of the
Gaussian free field and volume decay of Liouville balls and scaling exponents. Our key incentive
arises from linking the size of a given set of continuous paths from the viewpoint of the geometry
of the Wiener space, to that of its counterpart from the viewpoint of the {\it random geometry} induced
by the exponential tilting in the GMC space. We show that for any $d\geq 1$ and with the coupling constant
tuned sufficiently low (whence the field attains high values on {\it any } GMC sampled path in $d\geq
3$) and the white noise field spatially mollified at scale $\varepsilon>0$, the GMC volume of any
microscopic ball of radius $\varepsilon^{d/2}$ in the Wiener space, with its location chosen uniformly
therein, decays at least with speed $\varepsilon^d$ in an almost sure sense as $\varepsilon\downarrow
0$. A key aspect of our proof, while not making any assumptions about log-correlations, builds on
Kahane's techniques \cite{K85} in a general set up, combined with geometric properties of the underlying
metric space of continuous functions.

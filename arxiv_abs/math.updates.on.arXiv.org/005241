In this work, we establish near-linear and strong convergence for a natural first-order iterative
algorithm that simulates Von Neumann's Alternating Projections method in zero-sum games. First,
we provide a precise analysis of Optimistic Gradient Descent/Ascent (OGDA) -- an optimistic variant
of Gradient Descent/Ascent \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1711-00141} -- for \emph{unconstrained}
bilinear games, extending and strengthening prior results along several directions. Our characterization
is based on a closed-form solution we derive for the dynamics, while our results also reveal several
surprising properties. Indeed, our main algorithmic contribution is founded on a geometric feature
of OGDA we discovered; namely, the limit points of the dynamics are the orthogonal projection of
the initial state to the space of attractors. Motivated by this property, we show that the equilibria
for a natural class of \emph{constrained} bilinear games are the intersection of the unconstrained
stationary points with the corresponding probability simplexes. Thus, we employ OGDA to implement
an Alternating Projections procedure, converging to an $\epsilon$-approximate Nash equilibrium
in $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\log^2(1/\epsilon))$ iterations. Although our algorithm closely
resembles the no-regret projected OGDA dynamics, it surpasses the optimal no-regret convergence
rate of $\Theta(1/\epsilon)$ \cite{DASKALAKIS2015327}, while it also supplements the recent
work in pursuing last-iterate guarantees in saddle-point problems \cite{daskalakis2018lastiterate,mertikopoulos2018optimistic}.
Finally, we illustrate an -- in principle -- trivial reduction from any game to the assumed class
of instances, without altering the space of equilibria.

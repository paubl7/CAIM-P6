In 1952, Michael posed a question about the functional continuity of commutative Frechet algebras
in his memoir, known as Michael problem in the literature. We settle this in the affirmative along
with its various equivalent forms, even for the non-commutative case. Indeed, we continue our recent
works, and develop two approaches to directly attack these problems. The first approach is to show
that the test case for this problem, the Frechet algebra of all entire functions on the Banach space
of all bounded complex sequences, is, in fact, a Frechet algebra of all complex formal power series
in one indeterminate, if there exists a discontinuous character. In the second approach, the existence
of a discontinuous character would allow us to generate other Frechet algebra topology, inequivalent
to the usual Frechet algebra topology, by applying the method of Read (he used this method to show
that the famous Singer-Wermer conjecture (1955) fails in the Frechet case). In both the approaches,
an important tool is a topological version of the (symmetric) tensor algebra over a Banach space;
the elementary, but crucial, idea is to express the test algebra as a weighted Frechet symmetric
algebra over the Banach space of all absolutely summable complex sequences. Several mathematicians
have worked on two problems of Michael since 1952, giving affirmative solutions for special classes
of Frechet algebras under various conditions, or discussing various test cases, or discussing
various approaches, or discussing various other equivalent forms, or deriving other important
automatic continuity results such as the (non-)uniqueness of the Frechet algebra topology for
certain commutative Frechet algebras by alternate, difficult or lengthy methods. We summarize
effects of our affirmative solutions on these attempts in addition to giving various new (important)
applications in automatic continuity theory.

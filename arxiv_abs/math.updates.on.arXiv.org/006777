Let $G$ be a graph with vertex set $V$, and let $k$ be a positive integer. A set $D \subseteq V$ is a \emph{distance-$k$
dominating set} of $G$ if, for each vertex $u \in V-D$, there exists a vertex $w\in D$ such that $d(u,w)
\le k$, where $d(u,w)$ is the length of a shortest path between the vertices in $G$. Let $d_k(x, y)=\min\{d(x,y),
k+1\}$. A set $R\subseteq V$ is a \emph{distance-$k$ resolving set} of $G$ if, for any pair of distinct
$x,y\in V$, there exists a vertex $z\in R$ such that $d_k(x,z) \neq d_k(y,z)$. The \emph{distance-$k$
domination number} $\gamma_k(G)$ (\emph{distance-$k$ dimension} $\dim_k(G)$, respectively)
of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of all distance-$k$ dominating sets (distance-$k$ resolving
sets, respectively) of $G$. The \emph{distance-$k$ location-domination number}, $\gamma_L^k(G)$,
of $G$ is the minimum cardinality of all sets $S\subseteq V$ such that $S$ is both a distance-$k$ dominating
set and a distance-$k$ resolving set of $G$. Note that $\gamma_L^1(G)$ is the well-known location-domination
number introduced by Slater in 1988. For any connected graph $G$ of order $n\ge 2$, we obtain the following
sharp bounds: (1) $\gamma_k(G) \le \dim_k(G)+1$; (2) $2\le\gamma_k(G)+\dim_k(G) \le n$; (3)
$1\le \max\{\gamma_k(G), \dim_k(G)\} \le \gamma_L^k(G) \le \min\{\dim_k(G)+1, n-1\}$. We characterize
$G$ for which $\gamma_L^k(G)\in\{1, |V|-1\}$. We observe that $\frac{\dim_k(G)}{\gamma_k(G)}$
can be arbitrarily large. Moreover, for any tree $T$ of order $n\ge 2$, we show that $\gamma_L^k(T)\le
n-ex(T)$, where $ex(T)$ denotes the number of exterior major vertices of $T$, and we characterize
trees $T$ achieving equality. We also examine the effect of edge deletion on the distance-$k$ location-domination
number of graphs.

We study the vanishing dissipation limit of the three-dimensional (3D) compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier
equations to the corresponding 3D full Euler equations. Our results are twofold. First, we prove
that the 3D compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier equations admit a family of smooth solutions that
converge to the planar rarefaction wave solution of the 3D compressible Euler equations with arbitrary
strength. Second, we obtain a uniform convergence rate in terms of the viscosity and heat-conductivity
coefficients. For this multi-dimensional problem, we first need to introduce the hyperbolic wave
to recover the physical dissipations of the inviscid rarefaction wave profile as in our previous
work [29] on the two-dimensional (2D) case. However, due to the 3D setting that makes the analysis
significantly more challenging than the 2D problem, the hyperbolic scaled variables for the space
and time could not be used to normalize the dissipation coefficients as in the 2D case. Instead, the
analysis of the 3D case is carried out in the original non-scaled variables, and consequently the
dissipation terms are more singular compared with the 2D scaled case. Novel ideas and techniques
are developed to establish the uniform estimates. In particular, more accurate {\it a priori} assumptions
with respect to the dissipation coefficients are crucially needed for the stability analysis,
and some new observations on the cancellations of the physical structures for the flux terms are
essentially used to justify the 3D limit. Moreover, we find that the decay rate with respect to the
dissipation coefficients is determined by the nonlinear flux terms in the original variables for
the 3D limit in this paper, but fully determined by the error terms in the scaled variables for the
2D case in [29].

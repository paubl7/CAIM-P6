We investigate the Einstein vacuum equations as well as the Einstein-null fluid equations describing
neutrino radiation. We find new structures in gravitational waves and memory for asymptotically-flat
spacetimes of slow decay. It has been known that for stronger decay of the data, including data being
stationary outside a compact set, gravitational wave memory is finite and of electric parity only.
In this article, we investigate general spacetimes that are asymptotically flat in a rough sense.
That is, the decay of the data to Minkowski space towards infinity is very slow. As a main new feature,
we prove that there exists diverging magnetic memory sourced by the magnetic part of the curvature
tensor (a) in the Einstein vacuum and (b) in the Einstein-null-fluid equations. The magnetic memory
occurs naturally in the Einstein vacuum setting (a) of pure gravity. In case (b), in the ultimate
class of solutions, the magnetic memory contains also a curl term from the energy-momentum tensor
for neutrinos also diverging at the aforementioned rate. The electric memory diverges too, it is
generated by the electric part of the curvature tensor and in the Einstein-null-fluid situation
also by the corresponding energy-momentum component. In addition, we find a panorama of finer structures
in these manifolds. Some of these manifest themselves as additional contributions to both electric
and magnetic memory. Our theorems hold for any type of matter or energy coupled to the Einstein equations
as long as the data decays slowly towards infinity and other conditions are satisfied. The new results
have a multitude of applications ranging from mathematical general relativity to gravitational
wave astrophysics, detecting dark matter and other topics in physics.

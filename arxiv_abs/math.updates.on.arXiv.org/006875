Many spatio-temporal data record the time of birth and death of individuals, along with their spatial
trajectories during their lifetime, whether through continuous-time observations or discrete-time
observations. Natural applications include epidemiology, individual-based modelling in ecology,
spatio-temporal dynamics observed in bio-imaging, and computer vision. The aim of this article
is to estimate in this context the birth and death intensity functions, that depend in full generality
on the current spatial configuration of all alive individuals. While the temporal evolution of
the population size is a simple birth-death process, observing the lifetime and trajectories of
all individuals calls for a new paradigm. To formalise this framework, we introduce spatial birth-death-move
processes, where the birth and death dynamics depends on the current spatial configuration of the
population and where individuals can move during their lifetime according to a continuous Markov
process with possible interactions.We consider non-parametric kernel estimators of their birth
and death intensity functions. The setting is original because each observation in time belongs
to a non-vectorial, infinite dimensional space and the dependence between observations is barely
tractable. We prove the consistency of the estimators in presence of continuous-time and discrete-time
observations, under fairly simple conditions. We moreover discuss how we can take advantage in
practice of structural assumptions made on the intensity functions and we explain how data-driven
bandwidth selection can be conducted, despite the unknown (and sometimes undefined) second order
moments of the estimators. We finally apply our statistical method to the analysis of the spatio-temporal
dynamics of proteins involved in exocytosis in cells, providing new insights on this complex mechanism.

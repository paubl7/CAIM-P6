Recently, as a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, dependence on telecommunication for remote
working and telemedicine has significantly increased. In cellular networks, incorporation of
Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can result in enhanced connectivity for outdoor users due to the
high probability of establishing Line of Sight (LoS) links. The UAV's limited battery life and its
signal attenuation in indoor areas, however, make it inefficient to manage users' requests in indoor
environments. Referred to as the Cluster centric and Coded UAV-aided Femtocaching (CCUF) framework,
the network's coverage in both indoor and outdoor environments increases via a two-phase clustering
for FAPs' formation and UAVs' deployment. First objective is to increase the content diversity.
In this context, we propose a coded content placement in a cluster-centric cellular network, which
is integrated with the Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP) to mitigate the inter-cell interference
in edge areas. Then, we compute, experimentally, the number of coded contents to be stored in each
caching node to increase the cache-hit ratio, Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR),
and cache diversity and decrease the users' access delay and cache redundancy for different content
popularity profiles. Capitalizing on clustering, our second objective is to assign the best caching
node to indoor/outdoor users for managing their requests. In this regard, we define the movement
speed of ground users as the decision metric of the transmission scheme for serving outdoor users'
requests to avoid frequent handovers between FAPs and increase the battery life of UAVs. Simulation
results illustrate that the proposed CCUF implementation increases the cache hit-ratio, SINR,
and cache diversity and decrease the users' access delay, cache redundancy and UAVs' energy consumption.

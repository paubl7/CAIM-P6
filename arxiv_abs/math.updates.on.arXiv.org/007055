This paper studies intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-aided full-duplex (FD) wireless-powered
communication network (WPCN), where a hybrid access point (HAP) broadcasts energy signals to multiple
devices for their energy harvesting in the downlink (DL) and meanwhile receives information signals
in the uplink (UL) with the help of IRS. Particularly, we propose three types of IRS beamforming configurations
to strike a balance between the system performance and signaling overhead as well as implementation
complexity. We first propose the fully dynamic IRS beamforming, where the IRS phase-shift vectors
vary with each time slot for both DL wireless energy transfer (WET) and UL wireless information transmission
(WIT). To further reduce signaling overhead and implementation complexity, we then study two special
cases, namely, partially dynamic IRS beamforming and static IRS beamforming. For the former case,
two different phase-shift vectors can be exploited for the DL WET and the UL WIT, respectively, whereas
for the latter case, the same phase-shift vector needs to be applied for both DL and UL transmissions.
We aim to maximize the system throughput by jointly optimizing the time allocation, HAP transmit
power, and IRS phase shifts for the above three cases. Two efficient algorithms based on alternating
optimization and penalty-based algorithms are respectively proposed for both perfect self-interference
cancellation (SIC) case and imperfect SIC case by applying successive convex approximation and
difference-of-convex optimization techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the benefits
of IRS for enhancing the performance of FD-WPCN, and also show that the IRS-aided FD-WPCN is able
to achieve significantly performance gain compared to its counterpart with half-duplex when the
self-interference (SI) is properly suppressed.

Disordered complex networks are of fundamental interest as stochastic models for information
transmission over wireless networks. Well-known networks based on the Poisson point process model
have limitations vis-a-vis network efficiency, whereas strongly correlated alternatives, such
as those based on random matrix spectra (RMT), have tractability and robustness issues. In this
work, we demonstrate that network models based on random perturbations of Euclidean lattices interpolate
between Poisson and rigidly structured networks, and allow us to achieve the best of both worlds
: significantly improve upon the Poisson model in terms of network efficacy measured by the Signal
to Interference plus Noise Ratio (abbrv. SINR) and the related concept of coverage probabilities,
at the same time retaining a considerable measure of mathematical and computational simplicity
and robustness to erasure and noise. We investigate the optimal choice of the base lattice in this
model, connecting it to the celebrated problem optimality of Euclidean lattices with respect to
the Epstein Zeta function, which is in turn related to notions of lattice energy. This leads us to
the choice of the triangular lattice in 2D and face centered cubic lattice in 3D. We demonstrate that
the coverage probability decreases with increasing strength of perturbation, eventually converging
to that of the Poisson network. In the regime of low disorder, we approximately characterize the
statistical law of the coverage function. In 2D, we determine the disorder strength at which the
PTL and the RMT networks are the closest measured by comparing their network topologies via a comparison
of their Persistence Diagrams . We demonstrate that the PTL network at this disorder strength can
be taken to be an effective substitute for the RMT network model, while at the same time offering the
advantages of greater tractability.

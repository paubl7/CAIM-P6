We prove the converse to a result of Karlin [Trans. AMS 1964], and also strengthen his result and two
results of Schoenberg [Ann. of Math. 1955]. One of the latter results concerns zeros of Laplace transforms
of multiply positive functions. The other results study which powers $\alpha$ of two specific kernels
are totally non-negative of order $p\geq 2$ (denoted TN$_p$); both authors showed this happens
for $\alpha\geq p-2$, and Schoenberg proved that it does not for $\alpha<p-2$. We show more strongly
that for every $p \times p$ submatrix of either kernel, up to a 'shift', its $\alpha$th power is totally
positive of order $p$ (TP$_p$) for every $\alpha > p-2$, and is not TN$_p$ for every non-integer $\alpha\in(0,p-2)$.
In particular, these results reveal 'critical exponent' phenomena in total positivity. We also
prove the converse to a 1968 result of Karlin, revealing yet another critical exponent phenomenon
- for Laplace transforms of all Polya Frequency (PF) functions. We further classify the powers preserving
all TN$_p$ Hankel kernels on intervals, and isolate individual kernels encoding these powers.
We then transfer results on preservers by Polya-Szego (1925), Loewner/Horn (1969), and Khare-Tao
(in press), from positive matrices to Hankel TN$_p$ kernels. Another application constructs individual
matrices encoding the Loewner convex powers. This complements Jain's results (2020) for Loewner
positivity, which we strengthen to total positivity. Remarkably, these (strengthened) results
of Jain, those of Schoenberg and Karlin, the latter's converse, and the above Hankel kernels all
arise from a single symmetric rank-two kernel and its powers: $\max(1+xy,0)$. We also provide a
novel characterization of PF functions and sequences of order $p\geq 3$, following Schoenberg's
1951 result for $p=2$. We correct a small gap in his paper, in the classification of discontinuous
PF functions.

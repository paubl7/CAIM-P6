Departure time choice models play a crucial role in determining the traffic load in transportation
systems. This paper introduces a new framework to model and analyze the departure time user equilibrium
(DTUE) problem based on the so-called Mean Field Games (MFGs) theory. The proposed framework is
the combination of two main components including (i) the reaction of travelers to the traffic congestion
by choosing their departure times to optimize their travel cost; and (ii) the aggregation of the
actions of the travelers, which determines the system level of service. In this paper, we first present
a continuous departure time choice model and investigate the equilibria of the system. Specifically,
we demonstrate the existence of the equilibrium and characterize the DTUE. Then, a discrete approximation
of the system is provided based on deterministic differential game models to numerically obtain
the equilibrium of the system. To examine the efficiency of the proposed model, we compare it with
the departure time choice models in the literature. We apply our framework to a standard test case
and observe that the solutions obtained based on our model are 5.6\% better in terms of relative cost
compared to the solutions determined based on models in the literature. Moreover, our proposed
model converges with less number of iterations than the reference solution method in the literature.
Finally, the model is scaled up to the real test case corresponding to the whole Lyon Metropolis with
real demand pattern. The results show that the proposed framework is able to tackle much larger test
case than usual to includes multiple preferred travel times and heterogeneous trip lengths more
accurately than existing models in the literature.

The recently proposed Sampling Kaczmarz Motzkin (SKM) algorithm performs well in comparison with
the state-of-the-art methods in solving large-scale Linear Feasibility (LF) problems. To explore
the concept of momentum in the context of solving LF problems, in this work, we propose a momentum
induced algorithm called Momentum Sampling Kaczmarz Motzkin (MSKM). The MSKM algorithm is developed
by integrating the heavy ball momentum to the SKM algorithm. We provide a rigorous convergence analysis
of the proposed MSKM algorithm from which we obtain convergence results of several Kaczmarz type
methods for solving LF problems. Moreover, under somewhat weaker conditions, we establish a sub-linear
convergence rate for the so-called \textit{Cesaro} average of the sequence generated by the MSKM
algorithm. We then back up the theoretical results via thorough numerical experiments on artificial
and real datasets. For a fair comparison, we test our proposed method in comparison with the SKM method
on a wide variety of test instances: 1) randomly generated instances, 2) Netlib LPs and 3) linear
classification test instances. We also compare the proposed method with the traditional Interior
Point Method (IPM) and Active Set Method (ASM) on Netlib LPs. The proposed momentum induced algorithm
significantly outperforms the basic SKM method (with no momentum) on all of the considered test
instances. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm also performs well in comparison with IPM and ASM
algorithms. Finally, we propose a stochastic version of the MSKM algorithm called Stochastic-Momentum
Sampling Kaczmarz Motzkin (SSKM) to better handle large-scale real-world data. We conclude our
work with a rigorous theoretical convergence analysis of the proposed SSKM algorithm.

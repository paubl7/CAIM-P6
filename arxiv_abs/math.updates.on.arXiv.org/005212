Noticing that agents with different dynamics may work together, this paper considers Nash equilibrium
computation for a class of games in which first-order integrator-type players and second-order
integrator-type players interact in a distributed network. To deal with this situation, we firstly
exploit a centralized method for full information games. In the considered scenario, the players
can employ its own gradient information, though it may rely on all players' actions. Based on the
proposed centralized algorithm, we further develop a distributed counterpart. Different from
the centralized one, the players are assumed to have limited access into the other players' actions.
In addition, noticing that unmodeled dynamics and disturbances are inevitable for practical engineering
systems, the paper further considers games in which the players' dynamics are suffering from unmodeled
dynamics and time-varying disturbances. In this situation, an adaptive neural network is utilized
to approximate the unmodeled dynamics and disturbances, based on which a centralized Nash equilibrium
seeking algorithm and a distributed Nash equilibrium seeking algorithm are established successively.
Appropriate Lyapunov functions are constructed to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed
methods analytically. It is shown that if the considered mixed-order game is free of unmodeled dynamics
and disturbances, the proposed method would drive the players' actions to the Nash equilibrium
exponentially. Moreover, if unmodeled dynamics and disturbances are considered, the players'
actions would converge to arbitrarily small neighborhood of the Nash equilibrium. Lastly, the
theoretical results are numerically verified by simulation examples.

Optimizing expensive black-box systems with limited data is an extremely challenging problem.
As a resolution, we present a new surrogate optimization approach by addressing two gaps in prior
research -- unimportant input variables and inefficient treatment of uncertainty associated
with the black-box output. We first design a new flexible non-interpolating parsimonious surrogate
model using a partitioning-based multivariate adaptive regression splines approach, Tree Knot
MARS (TK-MARS). The proposed model is specifically designed for optimization by capturing the
structure of the function, bending at near-optimal locations, and is capable of screening unimportant
input variables. Furthermore, we develop a novel replication approach called Smart-Replication,
to overcome the uncertainty associated with the black-box output. The Smart-Replication approach
identifies promising input points to replicate and avoids unnecessary evaluations of other data
points. Smart-Replication is agnostic to the choice of a surrogate and can adapt itself to an unknown
noise level. Finally to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed approaches we consider different
complex global optimization test functions from the surrogate optimization literature. The results
indicate that TK-MARS outperforms original MARS within a surrogate optimization algorithm and
successfully detects important variables. The results also show that although non-interpolating
surrogates can mitigate uncertainty, replication is still beneficial for optimizing highly complex
black-box functions. The robustness and the quality of the final optimum solution found through
Smart-Replication are competitive with that using no replications in environments with low levels
of noise and using a fixed number of replications in highly noisy environments.

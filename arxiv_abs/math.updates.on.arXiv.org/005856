Let $\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^{n+1}$, $n\ge 2$, be a 1-sided non-tangentially accessible domain
(i.e., quantitatively open and path-connected) satisfiying the capacity density condition.
Let $L_0 u=-\mathrm{div}(A_0 \nabla u)$, $Lu=-\mathrm{div}(A\nabla u)$ be two real uniformly
elliptic operators in $\Omega$, with $\omega_{L_0}, \omega_L$ the associated elliptic measures.
We establish the equivalence between the following properties: (i) $\omega_L \in A_{\infty}(\omega_{L_0})$,
(ii) $L$ is $L^p(\omega_{L_0})$-solvable for some $p\in (1,\infty)$, (iii) bounded null solutions
of $L$ satisfy Carleson measure estimates with respect to $\omega_{L_0}$, (iv) the conical square
function is controlled by the non-tangential maximal function in $L^q(\omega_{L_0})$ for some
(or for all) $q\in (0,\infty)$ for any null solution of $L$, and (v) $L$ is $\mathrm{BMO}(\omega_{L_0})$-solvable.
Moreover, in each of the properties (ii)-(v) it is enough to consider the class of solutions $u(X)=\omega_L^X(S)$
with arbitrary Borel sets $S\subset\partial\Omega$. Also, we characterize the absolute continuity
of $\omega_{L_0}$ with respect to $\omega_L$ in terms of some qualitative local $L^2(\omega_{L_0})$
estimates for the truncated conical square function for any bounded null solution of $L$. This is
also equivalent to the finiteness $\omega_{L_0}$-a.e. of the truncated conical square function
for any bounded null solution of $L$. As applications, we show that $\omega_{L_0}\ll\omega_L$
if the disagreement of the coefficients satisfies some qualitative quadratic estimate in truncated
cones for $\omega_{L_0}$-a.e. vertex. Finally, when $L_0$ is either the transpose of $L$ or its
symmetric part, we obtain the corresponding absolute continuity when the antisymmetric part of
the coefficients has some controlled oscillation in truncated cones for $\omega_{L_0}$-a.e.
vertex.

This paper is a continuation of Part I of this project, where we developed a new local well-posedness
theory for nonlinear stochastic PDEs with Gaussian noise. In the current Part II we consider blow-up
criteria and regularization phenomena. As in Part I we can allow nonlinearities with polynomial
growth, and rough initial values from critical spaces. In the first main result we obtain several
new blow-up criteria for quasi- and semilinear stochastic evolution equations. In particular,
for semilinear equations we obtain a Serrin type blow-up criterium, which extends a recent result
of Pr\"uss-Simonett-Wilke (2018) to the stochastic setting. Blow-up criteria can be used to prove
global well-posedness for SPDEs. As in Part I, maximal regularity techniques and weights in time
play a central role in the proofs. Our second contribution is a new method to bootstrap Sobolev and
H\"older regularity in time and space, which does not require smoothness of the initial data. The
blow-up criteria are at the basis of these new methods. Moreover, in applications the bootstrap
results can be combined with our blow-up criteria, to obtain efficient ways to prove global existence.
This gives new results even in classical $L^2$-settings, which we illustrate for a concrete SPDE.
In future works in preparation we apply the results of the current paper to obtain global well-posedness
results, and regularity for several concrete SPDEs. These include stochastic Navier-Stokes,
reaction diffusion equations, and Allen-Cahn equations. Our setting allows to put these SPDEs
into a more flexible framework, where less restrictions on the nonlinearities are needed, and we
are able to treat rough initial values from critical spaces. Moreover, we will obtain higher order
regularity results.

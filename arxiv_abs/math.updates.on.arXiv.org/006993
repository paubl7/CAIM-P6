In 1943, Hadwiger conjectured that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $(t-1)$-colorable for every
$t\ge 1$. In the 1980s, Kostochka and Thomason independently proved that every graph with no $K_t$
minor has average degree $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$ and hence is $O(t\sqrt{\log t})$-colorable. Recently,
Norin, Song and the second author showed that every graph with no $K_t$ minor is $O(t(\log t)^{\beta})$-colorable
for every $\beta > 1/4$, making the first improvement on the order of magnitude of the $O(t\sqrt{\log
t})$ bound. More recently, the second author showed they are $O(t (\log \log t)^{6})$-colorable.
Our main technical result is that the chromatic number of a $K_t$-minor-free graph is bounded by
$O(t(1+f(G,t))$ where $f(G,t)$ is the maximum of $\frac{\chi(H)}{a}$ over all $a\ge \frac{t}{\sqrt{\log
t}}$ and $K_a$-minor-free subgraphs $H$ of $G$ that are small (i.e. $O(a\log^4 a)$ vertices). This
has a number of interesting corollaries. First, it shows that proving Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture
(that $K_t$-minor-free graphs are $O(t)$-colorable) reduces to proving it for small graphs. Second,
using the current best-known bounds on coloring small $K_t$-minor-free graphs, we show that $K_t$-minor-free
graphs are $O(t\log\log t)$-colorable. Third, we prove that $K_t$-minor-free graphs with clique
number at most $\sqrt{\log t}/ (\log \log t)^2$ are $O(t)$-colorable. This implies our final corollary
that Linear Hadwiger's Conjecture holds for $K_r$-free graphs for any fixed $r$ and sufficiently
large $t$; more specifically, there exists $C\ge 1$ such that for every $r\ge 1$, there exists $t_r$
such that for all $t\ge t_r$, every $K_r$-free $K_t$-minor-free graph is $Ct$-colorable. One key
to proving the main theorem is a new standalone result that every $K_t$-minor-free graph of average
degree $d=\Omega(t)$ has a subgraph on $O(d \log^3 t)$ vertices with average degree $\Omega(d)$.

We consider a multiuser diffusion-based molecular communication (MC) system where multiple spatially
distributed transmitter (TX)-receiver (RX) pairs establish point-to-point communication links
employing the same type of signaling molecules. To realize the full potential of such a system, an
in-depth understanding of the interplay between the spatial user density and inter-user interference
(IUI) and its impact on system performance in an asymptotic regime with large numbers of users is
needed. In this paper, we adopt a three-dimensional (3-D) system model with multiple independent
and spatially distributed point-to-point transmission links, where both the TXs and RXs are positioned
according to a regular hexagonal grid, respectively. Based on this model, we first derive an expression
for the channel impulse responses (CIRs) of all TX-RX links in the system. Then, we provide the maximum
likelihood (ML) decision rule for the RXs and show that it reduces to a threshold-based detector.
We derive an analytical expression for the corresponding detection threshold which depends on
the statistics of the MC channel and the statistics of the IUI. Furthermore, we derive an analytical
expression for the bit error rate (BER) and the achievable rate of a single transmission link. Finally,
we propose a new performance metric, which we refer to as area rate efficiency (ARE), that captures
the tradeoff between the user density and IUI. The ARE characterizes how efficiently given TX and
RX areas are used for information transmission and is given in terms of bits per area unit. We show
that there exists an optimal user density for maximization of the ARE. Results from particle-based
and Monte Carlo simulations validate the accuracy of the expressions derived for the CIR, optimal
detection threshold, BER, and ARE.

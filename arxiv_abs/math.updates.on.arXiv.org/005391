Local-gradient-based optimization approaches lack nonlocal exploration ability required for
escaping from local minima in non-convex landscapes. A directional Gaussian smoothing (DGS) approach
was recently proposed by the authors (Zhang et al., 2020) and used to define a truly nonlocal gradient,
referred to as the DGS gradient, in order to enable nonlocal exploration in high-dimensional black-box
optimization. Promising results show that replacing the traditional local gradient with the nonlocal
DGS gradient can significantly improve the performance of gradient-based methods in optimizing
highly multi-modal loss functions. However, the current DGS method is designed for unbounded and
unconstrained optimization problems, making it inapplicable to real-world engineering design
optimization problems where the tuning parameters are often bounded and the loss function is usually
constrained by physical processes. In this work, we propose to extend the DGS approach to the constrained
inverse design framework in order to find a better design. The proposed framework has its advantages
in portability and flexibility to naturally incorporate the parameterization, physics simulation,
and objective formulation together to build up an effective inverse design workflow. A series of
adaptive strategies for smoothing radius and learning rate updating are developed to improve the
computational efficiency and robustness. To enable a clear binarized design, a dynamic growth
mechanism is imposed on the projection strength in parameterization. Our methodology is demonstrated
by an example of designing a nanoscale wavelength demultiplexer and shows superior performance
compared to the state-of-the-art approaches. By incorporating volume constraints, the optimized
design achieves an equivalently high performance but significantly reduces the amount of material
usage.

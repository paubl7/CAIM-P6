Intelligent reflecting/refracting surface (IRS) has recently emerged as a promising solution
to reconfigure wireless propagation environment for enhancing the communication performance.
In this paper, we study a new IRS-aided high-mobility communication system by employing the intelligent
refracting surface with a high-speed vehicle to aid its passenger's communication with a remote
base station (BS). Due to the environment's random scattering and vehicle's high mobility, a rapidly
time-varying channel is typically resulted between the static BS and fast-moving IRS/user, which
renders the channel estimation for IRS with a large number of elements more challenging. In order
to reap the high IRS passive beamforming gain with low channel training overhead, we propose a new
and efficient transmission protocol to achieve both IRS channel estimation and refraction optimization
for data transmission. Specifically, by exploiting the quasi-static channel between the IRS and
user both moving at the same high speed as well as the line-of-sight (LoS) dominant channel between
the BS and IRS, the user first estimates the LoS component of the cascaded BS-IRS-user channel, based
on which IRS passive refraction is designed to maximize the corresponding IRS-refracted channel
gain. Then, the user estimates the resultant IRS-refracted channel as well as the non-IRS-refracted
channel for setting an additional common phase shift at all IRS refracting elements so as to align
these two channels for maximizing the overall channel gain for data transmission. Simulation results
show significant performance improvement of the proposed design as compared to various benchmark
schemes. The proposed on-vehicle IRS system is further compared with a baseline scheme of deploying
fixed intelligent reflecting surfaces on the roadside to assist high-speed vehicular communications,
which achieves significant rate improvement.

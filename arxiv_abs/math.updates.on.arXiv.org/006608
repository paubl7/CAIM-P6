In Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted systems the acquisition of CSI and the optimization
of the reflecting coefficients constitute a pair of salient design issues. In this paper, a novel
channel training protocol is proposed, which is capable of achieving a flexible performance vs.
signalling and pilot overhead as well as implementation complexity trade-off. More specifically,
first of all, we conceive a holistic channel estimation protocol, which integrates the existing
channel estimation techniques and passive beamforming design. Secondly, we propose a new channel
training framework. In contrast to the conventional channel estimation arrangements, our new
framework divides the training phase into several periods, where the superimposed end-to-end
channel is estimated instead of separately estimating the direct BS-user channel and cascaded
reflected BS-RIS-user channels. As a result, the reflecting coefficients of the RIS are optimized
by comparing the objective function values over multiple training periods. Moreover, the theoretical
performance of our channel training protocol is analyzed and compared to that under the optimal
reflecting coefficients. In addition, the potential benefits of our channel training protocol
in reducing the complexity, pilot overhead as well as signalling overhead are also detailed. Thirdly,
we derive the theoretical performance of channel estimation protocols and our channel training
protocol in the presence of noise for a SISO scenario, which provides useful insights into the impact
of the noise on the overall RIS performance. Finally, our numerical simulations characterize the
performance of the proposed protocols and verify our theoretical analysis. In particular, the
simulation results demonstrate that our channel training protocol is more competitive than the
channel estimation protocol at low signal-to-noise ratios.

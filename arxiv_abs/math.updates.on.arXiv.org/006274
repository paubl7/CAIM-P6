In this paper, we study the optimal resource allocation algorithm design for large intelligent
reflecting surface (IRS)-assisted simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT)
systems. To facilitate efficient system design for large IRSs, instead of jointly optimizing all
the IRS elements, we partition the IRS into several tiles and employ a scalable optimization framework
comprising an offline design stage and an online optimization stage. In the offline stage, the IRS
elements of each tile are jointly designed to support a set of different phase shift configurations,
referred to as transmission modes, while the best transmission mode is selected from the set for
each tile in the online stage. Given a transmission mode set, we aim to minimize the total base station
(BS) transmit power by jointly optimizing the beamforming and the transmission mode selection
policy taking into account the quality-of-service requirements of information decoding and non-linear
energy harvesting receivers, respectively. Although the resource allocation algorithm design
is formulated as a non-convex combinatorial optimization problem, we solve it optimally by applying
the branch-and-bound (BnB) approach which entails a high computational complexity. To strike
a balance between optimality and computational complexity, we also develop an efficient suboptimal
algorithm capitalizing on the penalty method and successive convex approximation. Our simulation
results show that the proposed designs enable considerable power savings compared to several baseline
schemes. Moreover, our results reveal that by properly adjusting the numbers of tiles and transmission
modes, the proposed scalable optimization framework indeed facilitates online design for large
IRSs.

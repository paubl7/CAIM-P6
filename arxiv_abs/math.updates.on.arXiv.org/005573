We give an account of the theory of factorization spaces, categories, functors, and algebras, following
the approach of [Ras1]. We apply these results to give geometric constructions of factorization
$\mathbb{E}_n$ algebras describing mixed holomorphic-topological twists of supersymmetric
gauge theories in low dimensions. We formulate and prove several recent predictions from the physics
literature in this language: We recall the Coulomb branch construction of [BFN1] from this perspective.
We prove a conjecture from [CosG] that the Coulomb branch factorization $\mathbb{E}_1$ algebra
$\mathcal{A}(G,N)$ acts on the factorization algebra of chiral differential operators $\mathcal{D}^{ch}(Y)$
on the quotient stack $Y=N/G$. We identify the latter with the semi-infinite cohomology of $\mathcal{D}^{ch}(N)$
with respect to $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$, following the results of [Ras3]. Both these results require
the hypothesis that $Y$ admits a Tate structure, or equivalently that $\mathcal{D}^{ch}(N)$ admits
an action of $\hat{\mathfrak{g}}$ at level $\kappa=-\text{Tate}$. We construct an analogous
factorization $\mathbb{E}_2$ algebra $\mathcal{F}(Y)$ describing the local observables of
the mixed holomorphic-B twist of four dimensional $\mathcal{N}=2$ gauge theory. We apply the theory
of equivariant factorization algebras of the prequel [Bu1] in this example: we identify $S^1$ equivariant
structures on $\mathcal{F}(Y)$ with Tate structures on $Y=N/G$, and prove that the corresponding
filtered quantization of $\iota^!\mathcal{F}(Y)$ is given by the two-periodic Rees algebra of
chiral differential operators on $Y$. This gives a mathematical account of the results of [Beem4].
Finally, we apply the equivariant cigar reduction principle of [Bu1] to explain the relationship
between these results and our account of the results of [CosG] described above.

Distributed optimization is often widely attempted and innovated as an attractive and preferred
methodology to solve large-scale problems effectively in a localized and coordinated manner.
Thus, it is noteworthy that the methodology of distributed model predictive control (DMPC) has
become a promising approach to achieve effective outcomes, e.g., in decision-making tasks for
multi-agent systems. However, the typical deployment of such distributed MPC frameworks would
lead to the involvement of nonlinear processes with a large number of nonconvex constraints. To
address this important problem, the development and innovation of a hierarchical three-block
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach is presented in this work to solve
this nonconvex cooperative DMPC problem in multi-agent systems. Here firstly, an additional slack
variable is introduced to transform the original large-scale nonconvex optimization problem.
Then, a hierarchical ADMM approach, which contains outer loop iteration by the augmented Lagrangian
method (ALM) and inner loop iteration by three-block semi-proximal ADMM, is utilized to solve the
resulting transformed nonconvex optimization problem. Additionally, it is analytically shown
and established that the requisite desired stationary point exists for convergence in the algorithm.
Finally, an approximate optimization stage with a barrier method is then applied to further significantly
improve the computational efficiency, yielding the final improved hierarchical ADMM. The effectiveness
of the proposed method in terms of attained performance and computational efficiency is demonstrated
on a cooperative DMPC problem of decision-making process for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles
(UAVs).

The (third-order in time) JMGT equation \cite{Jordan2,HCP} is a nonlinear (quasi-linear) Partial
Differential Equation (PDE) model introduced to describe a nonlinear propagation of sound in an
acoustic medium. The important feature is that the model avoids the infinite speed of propagation
paradox associated with a classical second order in time equation referred to as Westervelt equation.
Replacing Fourier's law by Maxwell-Cattaneo's law gives rise to the third order in time derivative
scaled by a small parameter $\tau >0$, the latter represents the thermal relaxation time parameter
and is intrinsic to the medium where the dynamics occur. In this paper we provide an asymptotic analysis
of the third order model when $\tau \rightarrow 0 $. It is shown that the corresponding solutions
converge {\it in a strong topology of the phase space } to a limit which is the solution of Westervelt
equation. In addition, rate of convergence is provided for solutions displaying higher order regularity.
This addresses an open question raised in \cite{kaltev2}, where a related JMGT equation has been
studied and {\it weak star } convergence of the solutions when $\tau \rightarrow 0$ has been established.
Thus, our main contribution is showing {\it strong convergence on infinite time horizon,} along
with related rates of convergence valid on a finite time horizon. The key to unlocking the difficulty
owns to a tight control and propagation of the "smallness" of the initial data in carrying the estimates
at three different topological levels. The rate of convergence allows one then to estimate the relaxation
time needed for the signal to reach the target. The interest in studying this type of problems is motivated
by a large array of applications arising in engineering and medical sciences.

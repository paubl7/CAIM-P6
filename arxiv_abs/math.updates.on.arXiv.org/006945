First passage percolation (FPP) on $\mathbb{Z}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$ is a canonical model of a random
metric space where the standard Euclidean geometry is distorted by random noise. Of central interest
is the length and the geometry of the geodesic, the shortest path between points. Since the latter,
owing to its length minimization, traverses through atypically low values of the underlying noise
variables, it is an important problem to quantify the disparity between the environment rooted
at a point on the geodesic and the typical one. We investigate this in the context of $\gamma$-Liouville
Quantum Gravity (LQG) (where $\gamma \in (0,2)$ is a parameter) -- a random Riemannian surface induced
on the complex plane by the random metric tensor $e^{2\gamma h/d_{\gamma}} ({dx^2+dy^2}),$ where
$h$ is the whole plane, properly centered, Gaussian Free Field (GFF), and $d_\gamma$ is the associated
dimension. We consider the unique infinite geodesic $\Gamma$ from the origin, parametrized by
the logarithm of its chemical length, and show that, for an almost sure realization of $h$, the distributions
of the appropriately scaled field and the induced metric on a ball, rooted at a point "uniformly"
sampled on $\Gamma$, converge to deterministic measures on the space of generalized functions
and continuous metrics on the unit disk respectively. Moreover, we show that the limiting objects
living on the unit disk are singular with respect to their typical counterparts, but become absolutely
continuous away from the origin. Our arguments rely on unearthing a regeneration structure with
fast decay of correlation in the geodesic owing to coalescence and the domain Markov property of
the GFF. While there have been significant recent advances around this question for stochastic
planar growth models in the KPZ class, the present work initiates this research program in the context
of LQG.

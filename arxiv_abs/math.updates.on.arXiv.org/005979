Full waveform inversion (FWI) requires an accurate estimation of source signatures. Due to the
coupling between the source signatures and the subsurface model, small errors in the former can
translate into large errors in the latter. When direct methods are used to solve the forward problem,
classical frequency-domain FWI efficiently processes multiple sources for source signature
and wavefield estimations once a single Lower-Upper (LU) decomposition of the wave-equation operator
has been performed. However, this efficient FWI formulation is based on the exact solution of the
wave equation and hence is highly sensitive to the inaccuracy of the velocity model due to the cycle
skipping pathology. Recent extended-space FWI variants tackle this sensitivity issue through
a relaxation of the wave equation combined with data assimilation, allowing the wavefields to closely
match the data from the first inversion iteration. Then, the subsurface parameters are updated
by minimizing the wave-equation violations. When the wavefields and the source signatures are
jointly estimated with this approach, the extended wave equation operator becomes source dependent,
hence making direct methods ineffective. In this paper, we propose a simple method to bypass this
issue and estimate source signatures efficiently during extended FWI. The proposed method replaces
each source with a blended source during each data-assimilated wavefield reconstruction to make
the extended wave equation operator source independent. Besides computational efficiency, the
additional degrees of freedom introduced by spatially distributing the sources allows for a better
signature estimation at the physical location when the velocity model is rough. Numerical tests
on the Marmousi II and 2004 BP salt synthetic models confirm the efficiency and the robustness of
the proposed method.

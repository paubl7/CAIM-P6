In this article, we study the deformations of a finite morphism $\varphi$ to a projective space factoring
through an abelian cover of a complete intersection subvariety $Y$ and the intimately connected
problem of existence or non existence of multiple structures called ropes on $Y$. From our more general
main theorems we obtain the following interesting applications: (1) We construct infinitely many
ropes supported on complete intersection subvarieties, embedded in the projective space. We smooth
these ropes to obtain infinitely many families of smooth subvarieties with codimension in the range
of Hartshorne's conjecture. In addition, we systematically construct smooth non-complete intersection
subvarieties, embedded by complete linear series, outside the range of Hartshorne's conjecture,
thereby showing many ropes that are not in the boundary of a component of the Hilbert scheme parameterizing
smooth complete intersections subvarieties. (2) We go beyond Enriques' original question on constructing
simple canonical surfaces in projective spaces, and construct simple canonical varieties in all
dimensions. An infinite subset of these simple canonical varieties have finite birational canonical
map which is not an embedding. The deformations of the finite morphisms studied in this article display
a wide variety of behavior. In particular we show that there are infinitely many families of examples
for which a general deformation of the associated finite morphism of degree $n$ remains of degree
$n$, infinitely many families of examples for which degree $n$ becomes degree $n/2$ (when $n$ is
even), and infinitely many families for which degree $n$ becomes degree $1$. This has potential
applications to finding components of moduli spaces of varieties of general type in higher dimensions,
as the first two authors and Gonz\'alez showed for surfaces in [GGP2].

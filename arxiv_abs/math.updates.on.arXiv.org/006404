Sector duration optimization (SDO) is a problem arising in treatment planning for stereotactic
radiosurgery on Gamma Knife. Given a set of isocenter locations, SDO aims to select collimator size
configurations and irradiation times thereof such that target tissues receive prescribed doses
in a reasonable amount of treatment time, while healthy tissues nearby are spared. We present a multiobjective
linear programming model for SDO with a state-of-the-art delivery system, Leksell Gamma Knife
Icon, to generate a diverse collection of solutions so that one that best suits patient-specific
needs can be chosen by clinicians. We develop a generic two-phase solution strategy based on the
epsilon-constraint method for solving multiobjective optimization models, which aims to systematically
increase the number of high-quality solutions obtained, instead of conducting a traditional uniform
search. To improve solution quality further and accelerate the procedure, we incorporate some
general and problem-specific enhancements. Moreover, we propose an alternative version of our
two-phase strategy, which makes use of machine learning tools to devote the computational effort
rather to solving epsilon-constraint models that are predicted to yield clinically desirable
solutions. In our computational study on eight previously treated real test cases, a significant
portion of obtained solutions outperforms clinical results and those from a single-objective
model from the literature. In addition to significant benefits of the algorithmic enhancements,
our experiments illustrate the usefulness of machine learning strategies, reducing the overall
run times nearly by half while still capturing a sufficient selection of clinically desirable solutions.

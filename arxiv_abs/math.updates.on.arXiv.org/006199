Leclerc and Zelevinsky, motivated by the study of quasi-commuting quantum flag minors, introduced
the notions of strongly separated and weakly separated collections. These notions are closely
related to the theory of cluster algebras, to the combinatorics of the double Bruhat cells, and to
the totally positive Grassmannian. A key feature, called the purity phenomenon, is that every maximal
by inclusion strongly (resp., weakly) separated collection of subsets in $[n]$ has the same cardinality.
In this paper, we extend these notions and define $\mathcal{M}$-separated collections for any
oriented matroid $\mathcal{M}$. We show that maximal by size $\mathcal{M}$-separated collections
are in bijection with fine zonotopal tilings (if $\mathcal{M}$ is a realizable oriented matroid),
or with one-element liftings of $\mathcal{M}$ in general position (for an arbitrary oriented matroid).
We introduce the class of pure oriented matroids for which the purity phenomenon holds: an oriented
matroid $\mathcal{M}$ is pure if $\mathcal{M}$-separated collections form a pure simplicial
complex, i.e., any maximal by inclusion $\mathcal{M}$-separated collection is also maximal by
size. We pay closer attention to several special classes of oriented matroids: oriented matroids
of rank $3$, graphical oriented matroids, and uniform oriented matroids. We classify pure oriented
matroids in these cases. An oriented matroid of rank $3$ is pure if and only if it is a positroid (up
to reorienting and relabeling its ground set). A graphical oriented matroid is pure if and only if
its underlying graph is an outerplanar graph, that is, a subgraph of a triangulation of an $n$-gon.
We give a simple conjectural characterization of pure oriented matroids by forbidden minors and
prove it for the above classes of matroids (rank $3$, graphical, uniform).

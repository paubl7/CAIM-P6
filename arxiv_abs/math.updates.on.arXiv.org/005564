In this work, a general method for constructing linear maximum sum-rank distance (MSRD) codes is
introduced. By a previous result of the author, any of these MSRD codes provides a linear partial-MDS
(PMDS) code. For the MSRD code constructions, extended Moore matrices are introduced. These matrices
extend generator matrices of linearized Reed-Solomon codes, in the sense that evaluation points
inside a conjugacy class need not be linearly independent over the base field. The key result of this
work is a characterization of evaluation points per conjugacy class that turn extended Moore matrices
into the parity-check (or generator) matrix of a linear MSRD code. The sufficient and necessary
conditions on the evaluation points constitute a natural generalization of the geometric concept
of (partial) spread. Extending Segre's original construction of spreads, we provide a method based
on tensor products to produce satisfactory sequences of evaluation points. The method takes as
input a Hamming-metric code and gives as output a linear MSRD code. A list of linear MSRD codes admitting
a wide range of parameters is then obtained, giving as input trivial codes (yielding linearized
Reed-Solomon codes), MDS codes, Hamming codes, BCH codes and several Algebraic-Geometry codes.
Each of the obtained MSRD codes attains the smallest known field size, or the largest number of matrix
sets, for some parameter regime. In particular, the MSRD codes based on Hamming codes, valid for
minimum sum-rank distance $ 3 $, meet a recent bound by Byrne et al. These codes are also the first and
only known MSRD codes with field sizes that are linear in the code length if the number of columns per
matrix is constant. Finally, two new families of PMDS codes are obtained attaining smaller field
sizes than those in the literature for many parameter regimes.

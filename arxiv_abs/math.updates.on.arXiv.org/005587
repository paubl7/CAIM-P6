Conformal field theory (CFT) is an extremely powerful tool for explicitly computing critical exponents
and correlation functions of statistical mechanics systems at a second order phase transition,
or of condensed matter systems at a quantum critical point. Conformal invariance is expected to
be a feature of the fixed point theory obtained from a microscopic model at criticality, under appropriate
averaging and rescaling operations: the action of the Wilsonian Renormalization Group (RG). Unfortunately,
an explicit connection between critical microscopic models and their conformally invariant scaling
limit is still lacking in general. Nevertheless, the last decades witnessed significant progress
on this topic, both from the mathematical and physics sides, where several new tools have been introduced
and their ranges of applications have constantly and significantly increased: I refer here, e.g.,
to discrete holomorphicity, SLE, the use of lattice Ward Identities in constructive RG, the conformal
bootstrap program and its recent applications to 3D CFT. In an effort to make further progress on
these problems, the one-day workshop "Emergent CFTs in statistical mechanics" was organized:
the goal was to bring together probabilists, mathematical physicists and theoretical physicists,
working on various aspects of critical statistical mechanics systems with complementary tools,
both at the discrete and the continuum level, in the hope of creating new connections between the
different approaches. This paper is based on an introductory talk given at the workshop: after a
summary of the main topics discussed in the meeting, I illustrate the approach to the problem based
on constructive RG methods, by reviewing recent results on the existence and the explicit characterization
of the scaling limit of critical 2D Ising models with finite range interactions in cylindrical geometry.

This article establishes cutoff thermalization (also known as the cutoff phenomenon) for a class
of generalized Ornstein-Uhlenbeck systems $(X^\varepsilon_t(x))_{t\geqslant 0}$ with $\varepsilon$-small
additive L\'evy noise and initial value $x$. The driving noise processes include Brownian motion,
$\alpha$-stable L\'evy flights, finite intensity compound Poisson processes, and red noises,
and may be highly degenerate. Window cutoff thermalization is shown under mild generic assumptions;
that is, we see an asymptotically sharp $\infty/0$-collapse of the renormalized Wasserstein distance
from the current state to the equilibrium measure $\mu^\varepsilon$ along a time window centered
on a precise $\varepsilon$- and $x$-dependent time scale $t_\varepsilon^x$. In many interesting
situations such as reversible (L\'evy) diffusions it is possible to prove the existence of an explicit,
universal, deterministic cutoff thermalization profile. That is, for generic initial data $x$
we obtain the stronger result $\mathcal{W}_p(X^\varepsilon_{t_\varepsilon + r}(x), \mu^\varepsilon)
\cdot \varepsilon^{-1} \rightarrow K\cdot e^{-q r}$ as $\varepsilon \rightarrow 0$ for any $r\in
\mathbb{R}$, some spectral constants $K, q>0$ and any $p\geqslant 1$ whenever the distance is finite.
The existence of this limit is characterized by the absence of non-normal growth patterns in terms
of an orthogonality condition on a computable family of generalized eigenvectors of $\mathcal{Q}$.
Precise error bounds are given. Using these results, this article provides a complete discussion
of the cutoff phenomenon for the classical linear oscillator with friction subject to $\varepsilon$-small
Brownian motion or $\alpha$-stable L\'evy flights. Furthermore, we cover the highly degenerate
case of a linear chain of oscillators in a generalized heat bath at low temperature.

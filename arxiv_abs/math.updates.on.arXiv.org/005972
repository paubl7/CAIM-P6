This paper investigates moving networks of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), such as drones, as
one of the innovative opportunities brought by the 5G. With a main purpose to extend connectivity
and guarantee data rates, the drones require hovering locations due to limitations such as flight
time and coverage surface. We provide analytic bounds on the requirements in terms of connectivity
extension for vehicular networks served by fixed Enhanced Mobile BroadBand (eMBB) infrastructure,
where both vehicular networks and infrastructures are modeled using stochastic and fractal geometry
as a model for urban environment. We prove that assuming $n$ mobile nodes (distributed according
to a hyperfractal distribution of dimension $d_F$) and an average of $\rho$ Next Generation NodeB
(gNBs), distributed like an hyperfractal of dimension $d_r$ if $\rho=n^\theta$ with $\theta>d_r/4$
and letting $n$ tending to infinity (to reflect megalopolis cities), then the average fraction
of mobile nodes not covered by a gNB tends to zero like $O\left(n^{-\frac{(d_F-2)}{d_r}(2\theta-\frac{d_r}{2})}\right)$.
Interestingly, we then prove that the average number of drones, needed to connect each mobile node
not covered by gNBs is comparable to the number of isolated mobile nodes. We complete the characterisation
by proving that when $\theta<d_r/4$ the proportion of covered mobile nodes tends to zero. We provide
insights on the intelligent placement of the "garage of drones", the home location of these nomadic
infrastructure nodes, such as to minimize what we call the "flight-to-coverage time". We provide
a fast procedure to select the relays that will be garages (and store drones) in order to minimize
the number of garages and minimize the delay. Finally we confirm our analytical results using simulations
carried out in Matlab.

We study incidence bounds between points and hyperplanes in real $d$-space and their applications
to problems in communication complexity. Configurations of points and hyperplanes, along with
the incidences between them, can be modeled as bipartite graphs. We exposit an unpublished conjecture
of Golovnev, Meka, Sudan, and Velusamy on point-hyperplane incidence graphs, which posits the
existence of large complete bipartite subgraphs (of density $2^{-{\operatorname{polylog}(d)}}$)
if the entire graph has constant density. This conjecture implies the log-rank conjecture of Lov\'asz
and Saks in deterministic communication complexity via a reduction of Nisan and Wigderson to a conjecture
positing the existence of large monochromatic rectangles in low-rank Boolean matrices. Towards
this conjecture, we give a self-contained probabalistic argument for the existence of complete
bipartite subgraphs with incidence density $\Omega(\epsilon^{2d}/d)$ in any incidence graph
with density $\epsilon$ in dimension $d$ (a result showing that the density is constant for fixed
$\epsilon, d$ was obtained by Apfelbaum and Sharir using a much more complex incidence-geometric
argument). We improve an upper-bound constrution of Apfelbaum and Sharir (based on earlier work
of Elekes and T\'oth) by selecting a dense subset with many fewer vertices (by applying a Chernoff
bound), yielding a configuration whose complete bipartite subgraphs are exponentially small
and whose incidence density is $\Omega(1/\sqrt d)$. Finally, we survey the lower bounds of Apfelbaum
and Sharir, which are based on incidence bounds for nondegenerate hyperplanes of Elekes and T\'oth
(recently improved by Lund [arXiv:1708.00039]), and discuss their applicability/lack thereof
in our context.

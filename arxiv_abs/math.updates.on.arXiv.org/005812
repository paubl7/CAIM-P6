We consider the bilinear optimal control of an advection-reaction-diffusion system, where the
control arises as the velocity field in the advection term. Such a problem is generally challenging
from both theoretical analysis and algorithmic design perspectives mainly because the state variable
depends nonlinearly on the control variable and an additional divergence-free constraint on the
control is coupled together with the state equation. Mathematically, the proof of the existence
of optimal solutions is delicate, and up to now, only some results are known for a few special cases
where additional restrictions are imposed on the space dimension and the regularity of the control.
We prove the existence of optimal controls and derive the first-order optimality conditions in
general settings without any extra assumption. Computationally, the well-known conjugate gradient
(CG) method can be applied conceptually. However, due to the additional divergence-free constraint
on the control variable and the nonlinear relation between the state and control variables, it is
challenging to compute the gradient and the optimal stepsize at each CG iteration, and thus nontrivial
to implement the CG method. To address these issues, we advocate a fast inner preconditioned CG method
to ensure the divergence-free constraint and an efficient inexactness strategy to determine an
appropriate stepsize. An easily implementable nested CG method is thus proposed for solving such
a complicated problem. For the numerical discretization, we combine finite difference methods
for the time discretization and finite element methods for the space discretization. Efficiency
of the proposed nested CG method is promisingly validated by the results of some preliminary numerical
experiments.

We settle two long-standing complexity-theoretical questions-open since 1981 and 1993-in combinatorial
game theory (CGT). We prove that the Grundy value (a.k.a. nim-value, or nimber) of Undirected Geography
is PSPACE-complete to compute. This exhibits a stark contrast with a result from 1993 that Undirected
Geography is polynomial-time solvable. By distilling to a simple reduction, our proof further
establishes a dichotomy theorem, providing a "phase transition to intractability" in Grundy-value
computation, sharply characterized by a maximum degree of four: The Grundy value of Undirected
Geography over any degree-three graph is polynomial-time computable, but over degree-four graphs-even
when planar and bipartite-is PSPACE-hard. Additionally, we show, for the first time, how to construct
Undirected Geography instances with Grundy value $\ast n$ and size polynomial in n. We strengthen
a result from 1981 showing that sums of tractable partisan games are PSPACE-complete in two fundamental
ways. First, since Undirected Geography is an impartial ruleset, we extend the hardness of sums
to impartial games, a strict subset of partisan. Second, the 1981 construction is not built from
a natural ruleset, instead using a long sum of tailored short-depth game positions. We use the sum
of two Undirected Geography positions to create our hard instances. Our result also has computational
implications to Sprague-Grundy Theory (1930s) which shows that the Grundy value of the disjunctive
sum of any two impartial games can be computed-in polynomial time-from their Grundy values. In contrast,
we prove that assuming PSPACE $\neq$ P, there is no general polynomial-time method to summarize
two polynomial-time solvable impartial games to efficiently solve their disjunctive sum.

This paper studies subsets of one-sided shift spaces on a finite alphabet. Such subsets arise in
symbolic dynamics, in fractal constructions, and in number theory. We study a family of decimation
operations, which extract subsequences of symbol sequences in infinite arithmetic progressions,
and show they are closed under composition. We also study a family of $n$-ary interleaving operations,
one for each $n \ge 1$. Given subsets $X_0, X_1, ..., X_{n-1}$ of the shift space, the $n$-ary interleaving
operator produces a set whose elements combine individual elements ${\bf x}_i$, one from each $X_i$,
by interleaving their symbol sequences cyclically in arithmetic progressions $(\bmod\,n)$.
We determine algebraic relations between decimation and interleaving operators and the shift
operator. We study set-theoretic $n$-fold closure operations $X \mapsto X^{[n]}$, which interleave
decimations of $X$ of modulus level $n$. A set is $n$-factorizable if $X=X^{[n]}$. The $n$-fold
interleaving operators are closed under composition and are idempotent. To each $X$ we assign the
set $\mathcal{N}(X)$ of all values $n \ge 1$ for which $X= X^{[n]}$. We characterize the possible
sets $\mathcal{N}(X)$ as nonempty sets of positive integers that form a distributive lattice under
the divisibility partial order and are downward closed under divisibility. We show that all sets
of this type occur. We introduce a class of weakly shift-stable sets and show that this class is closed
under all decimation, interleaving, and shift operations. This class includes all shift-invariant
sets. We study two notions of entropy for subsets of the full one-sided shift and show that they coincide
for weakly shift-stable $X$, but can be different in general. We give a formula for entropy of interleavings
of weakly shift-stable sets in terms of individual entropies.

We further investigate the relations between the large degree asymptotics of the number of real
zeros of random trigonometric polynomials with dependent coefficients and the underlying correlation
function. We consider trigonometric polynomials of the form \[ f_n(t):= \frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_k
\cos(kt)+b_k\sin(kt), ~x\in [0,2\pi], \] where the sequences $(a_k)_{k\geq 1}$ and $(b_k)_{k\geq
1}$ are two independent copies of a stationary Gaussian process centered with variance one and correlation
function $\rho$ with associated spectral measure $\mu_{\rho}$. We focus here on the case where
$\mu_{\rho}$ is not purely singular and we denote by $\psi_{\rho}$ its density component with respect
to the Lebesgue measure $\lambda$. Quite surprisingly, we show that the asymptotics of the number
of real zeros $\mathcal{N}(f_n,[0,2\pi])$ of $f_n$ in $[0,2\pi]$ is not related to the decay of
the correlation function $\rho$ but instead to the Lebesgue measure of the vanishing locus of $\psi_{\rho}$.
Namely, assuming that $\psi_{\rho}$ is $\mathcal{C}^1$ with H\"older derivative on an open set
of full measure, one establishes that \[ \lim_{n \to +\infty} \frac{\mathbb E\left[\mathcal{N}(f_n,[0,2\pi])\right]}{n}=
\frac{\lambda(\{\psi_{\rho}=0\})}{\pi \sqrt{2}} + \frac{2\pi - \lambda(\{\psi_{\rho}=0\})}{\pi\sqrt{3}}.
\] On the other hand, assuming a sole log-integrability condition on $\psi_{\rho}$, which implies
that it is positive almost everywhere, we recover the asymptotics of the independent case, i.e.
the limit is $\frac{2}{\sqrt{3}}$. Besides, with further assumptions of regularity and existence
of negative moment for $\psi_{\rho}$, we moreover show that the above convergence in expectation
can be strengthened to an almost sure convergence.

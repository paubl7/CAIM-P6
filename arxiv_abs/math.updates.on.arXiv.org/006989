This paper provides a fundamental study of the consistency of insurance contracts. We start from
the observation that most insurance contracts are inherently linked to financial markets.. However
insurance markets differ from those of finance since there is no trade for once purchased contracts;
buying and selling simultaneously at different prices is not possible and the definition of finance
arbitrage is not applicable. In addition, the fact that the insurer's information is much larger
than the publicly available one used on financial markets gives rise to two different filtrations.
By defining strategies on an insurance portfolio and combining them with financial trading strategies,
we arrive at the notion of insurance-finance arbitrage (IFA). In analogy to the classical fundamental
theorem of asset pricing, we give a fundamental theorem on the absence of IFA, leading to the existence
of an insurance-finance-consistent probability. Hereby we include the case where the insurers'
filtration allows financial arbitrage. In its generality, the insurance-finance consistent
probability is of little use for insurance companies, since it has no relation whatsoever to statistical
data. Instead, for coping at least with market- (or finance-) consistency, a simple valuation rule
is used, constructed as a superposition of the statistical measure $P$ and a finance-consistent
measure $Q$ defined on the restricted market filtration. For this rule, our main theorem provides
two sufficient conditions for presence or absence of IFA, respectively. The generality of the approach
allows to incorporate many important aspects, like mortality risk or dependence of mortality and
stock markets. Utilizing the theory of enlargements of filtrations, we construct a tractable framework
for insurance-finance consistent valuation.

A multiple access channel describes a situation in which multiple senders are trying to forward
messages to a single receiver using some physical medium. In this paper we consider scenarios in
which this medium consists of just a single classical or quantum particle. In the quantum case, the
particle can be prepared in a superposition state thereby allowing for a richer family of encoding
strategies. To make the comparison between quantum and classical channels precise, we introduce
an operational framework in which all possible encoding strategies consume no more than a single
particle. We apply this framework to an N-port interferometer experiment in which each party controls
a path the particle can traverse. When used for the purpose of communication, this setup embodies
a multiple access channel (MAC) built with a single particle. We provide a full characterization
of the N-party classical MACs that can be built from a single particle, and we show that every non-classical
particle can generate a MAC outside the classical set. To further distinguish the capabilities
of a single classical and quantum particle, we relax the locality constraint and allow for joint
encodings by subsets of 1<K<= N parties. This generates a richer family of classical MACs whose polytope
dimension we compute. We identify a "generalized fingerprinting inequality" as a valid facet for
this polytope, and we verify that a quantum particle distributed among N separated parties can violate
this inequality even when K=N-1. Connections are drawn between the single-particle framework
and multi-level coherence theory. We show that every pure state with K-level coherence can be detected
in a semi-device independent manner, with the only assumption being conservation of particle number.

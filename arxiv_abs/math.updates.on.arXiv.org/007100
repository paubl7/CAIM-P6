The basic goal of threshold group testing is to identify up to $d$ defective items among a population
of $n$ items, where $d$ is usually much smaller than $n$. The outcome of a test on a subset of items is
positive if the subset has at least $u$ defective items, negative if it has up to $\ell$ defective
items, where $0\leq\ell<u$, and arbitrary otherwise. This is called threshold group testing.
The parameter $g=u-\ell-1$ is called \textit{the gap}. In this paper, we focus on the case $g>0$,
i.e., threshold group testing with a gap. Note that the results presented here are also applicable
to the case $g = 0$; however, the results are not as efficient as those in related work. Currently,
a few reported studies have investigated test designs and decoding algorithms for identifying
defective items. Most of the previous studies have not been feasible because there are numerous
constraints on their problem settings or the decoding complexities of their proposed schemes are
relatively large. Therefore, it is compulsory to reduce the number of tests as well as the decoding
complexity, i.e., the time for identifying the defective items, for achieving practical schemes.
The work presented here makes five contributions. The first is a more accurate theorem for a non-adaptive
algorithm for threshold group testing proposed by Chen and Fu. The second is an improvement in the
construction of disjunct matrices, which are the main tools for tackling (threshold) group testing
and other tasks such as constructing cover-free families or learning hidden graphs. The third and
fourth contributions are a reduced exact upper bound on the number of tests and a reduced asymptotic
bound on the decoding time for identifying defective items in a noisy setting on test outcomes. The
fifth contribution is a simulation on the number of tests of the resulting improvements for previous
work and the proposed theorems.

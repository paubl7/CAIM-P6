We investigate the dual of a Multistage Stochastic Linear Program (MSLP) to study two questions
for this class of problems. The first of these questions is the study of the optimal value of the problem
as a function of the involved parameters. For this sensitivity analysis problem, we provide formulas
for the derivatives of the value function with respect to the parameters and illustrate their application
on an inventory problem. Since these formulas involve optimal dual solutions, we need an algorithm
that computes such solutions to use them. In this context, the second question we address is the study
of solution methods for the dual problem. Writing Dynamic Programming (DP) equations for the dual,
we can use an SDDP type method, called Dual SDDP, which solves these DP equations. However, applying
this method will only be possible if the Relatively Complete Recourse (RCR) holds for the dual. Since
the RCR assumption may fail to hold, we design two variants of Dual SDDP, namely Dual SDDP with penalizations
and Dual SDDP with feasibility cuts. The study of this second question allows us to take a fresh look
at the notoriously difficult to solve class of MSLP with interstage dependent cost coefficients.
Indeed, for this class of problems, cost-to-go functions are non-convex and solution methods were
so far using SDDP for a Markov chain approximation of the cost coefficients process. For these problems,
we propose to apply Dual SDDP with penalizations to the cost-to-go functions of the dual which are
concave. This algorithm converges to the optimal value of the problem. Finally, as a proof of concept
of the tools developed, we present the results of numerical experiments computing the sensitivity
of the optimal value of an inventory problem as a function of parameters of the demand process and
compare Primal and Dual SDDP on the inventory and a hydro-thermal planning problems.

Terahertz (THz) communication is considered to be a promising technology for future 6G network.
To overcome the severe attenuation and relieve the high power consumption, massive MIMO with hybrid
precoding has been widely considered for THz communication. However, accurate wideband channel
estimation is challenging in THz massive MIMO systems. The existing wideband channel estimation
schemes based on the ideal assumption of common sparse channel support will suffer from a severe
performance loss due to the beam split effect. In this paper, we propose a beam split pattern detection
based channel estimation scheme to realize reliable wideband channel estimation. Specifically,
a comprehensive analysis on the angle-domain sparse structure of the wideband channel is provided
by considering the beam split effect. Based on the analysis, we define a series of index sets called
as beam split patterns, which are proved to have a one-to-one match to different physical channel
directions. Inspired by this one-to-one match, we propose to estimate the physical channel direction
by exploiting beam split patterns at first. Then, the sparse channel supports at different subcarriers
can be obtained by utilizing a support detection window. This support detection window is generated
by expanding the beam split pattern which is determined by the obtained physical channel direction.
The above estimation procedure will be repeated path by path until all path components are estimated.
The proposed scheme exploits the wideband channel property implied by the beam split effect, which
can significantly improve the channel estimation accuracy. Simulation results show that the proposed
scheme is able to achieve higher accuracy than existing schemes.

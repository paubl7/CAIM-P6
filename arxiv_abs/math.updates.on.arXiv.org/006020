We prove the existence of similar and multi-similar point configurations (or simplexes) in sets
of fractional Hausdorff measure in Euclidean space. These results can be viewed as variants, for
thin sets, of theorems for sets of positive density in $\Bbb R^d$ due to Furstenberg, Katznelson
and Weiss \cite{FKW90}, Bourgain \cite{B86} and Ziegler \cite{Z06}. Let $d \ge 2$ and $E\subset
{\Bbb R}^d$ be a compact set. For $k\ge 1$, define $$\Delta_k(E)=\left\{\left(|x^1-x^2|, \dots,
|x^i-x^j|,\dots, |x^k-x^{k+1}|\right): \left\{x^i\right\}_{i=1}^{k+1}\subset E\right\}
\subset {\Bbb R}^{k(k+1)/2}, $$ the {\it $(k+1)$-point configuration set} of $E$. For $k\le d$,
this is (up to permutations) the set of congruences of $(k+1)$-point configurations in $E$; for
$k>d$, it is the edge-length set of $(k+1)$-graphs whose vertices are in $E$. Previous works by a
number of authors have found values $s_{k,d}<d$ so that if the Hausdorff dimension of $E$ is $>s_{k,d}$,
then $\Delta_k(E)$ has positive Lebesgue measure. In this paper we study more refined properties
of $\Delta_k(E)$, namely the existence of (exactly) similar or multi--similar configurations.
For $r\in\Bbb R,\, r>0$, let $$\Delta_{k}^{r}(E):=\left\{\vec{t}\in \Delta_k\left(E\right):
r\vec{t}\in \Delta_k\left(E\right)\right\}\subset \Delta_k\left(E\right).$$ We show that
for all $E$ with Hausdorff dimension $>s_{k,d}$, a natural measure $\nu_k$ on $\Delta_k(E)$ and
all $r\in\Bbb R_+$, one has $\nu_k\left(\Delta_{k}^{r}\left(E\right)\right)>0$. Thus, there
exist many pairs, $\{x^1, x^2, \dots, x^{k+1}\}$ and $\{y^1, y^2, \dots, y^{k+1}\}$, in $E$ which
are similar by the scaling factor $r$. We also show the existence of triply-similar and multi-similar
configurations.

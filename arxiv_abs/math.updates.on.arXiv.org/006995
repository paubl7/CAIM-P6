Infinitesimal symmetries of a partial differential equation (PDE) can be defined as the solutions
of the linearization (Frechet derivative) equation holding on the space of solutions to the PDE,
and they are well-known to comprise a linear space having the structure of a Lie algebra.Solutions
of the adjoint linearization equation holding on the space of solutions to the PDE are called adjoint-symmetries.
Their algebraic structure for general PDE systems is studied herein. This is motivated by the correspondence
between variational symmetries and conservation laws arising from Noether's theorem, which has
a well-known generalization to non-variational PDEs, where infinitesimal symmetries are replaced
by adjoint-symmetries, and variational symmetries are replaced by multipliers (adjoint-symmetries
satisfying a certain Euler-Lagrange condition). Several main results are obtained. Symmetries
are shown to have three different linear actions on the linear space of adjoint-symmetries. These
linear actions are used to construct bilinear adjoint-symmetry brackets, one of which is a pull-back
of the symmetry commutator bracket and has the properties of a Lie bracket. The brackets do not use
or require the existence of any local variational structure (Hamiltonian or Lagrangian) and thus
apply to general PDE systems. In the case of variational PDEs, adjoint-symmetries coincide with
symmetries, and the linear actions themselves constitute new bilinear symmetry brackets which
differ from the commutator bracket when acting on non-variational symmetries. In addition, one
of the symmetry actions is shown to encode a pre-sympletic (Noether) operator and a symplectic 2-form,
which lead to the construction of a Hamiltonian structure. Several examples of physically interesting
nonlinear PDEs are used to illustrate all of the results.

An abelian network is a collection of communicating automata whose state transitions and message
passing each satisfy a local commutativity condition. This paper is a continuation of the abelian
networks series of Bond and Levine (2016), for which we extend the theory of abelian networks that
halt on all inputs to networks that can run forever. A nonhalting abelian network can be realized
as a discrete dynamical system in many different ways, depending on the update order. We show that
certain features of the dynamics, such as minimal period length, have intrinsic definitions that
do not require specifying an update order. We give an intrinsic definition of the \emph{torsion
group} of a finite irreducible (halting or nonhalting) abelian network, and show that it coincides
with the critical group of Bond and Levine (2016) if the network is halting. We show that the torsion
group acts freely on the set of invertible recurrent components of the trajectory digraph, and identify
when this action is transitive. This perspective leads to new results even in the classical case
of sinkless rotor networks (deterministic analogues of random walks). In Holroyd et. al (2008)
it was shown that the recurrent configurations of a sinkless rotor network with just one chip are
precisely the unicycles (spanning subgraphs with a unique oriented cycle, with the chip on the cycle).
We generalize this result to abelian mobile agent networks with any number of chips. We give formulas
for generating series such as \[ \sum_{n \geq 1} r_n z^n = \det (\frac{1}{1-z}D - A ) \] where $r_n$
is the number of recurrent chip-and-rotor configurations with $n$ chips; $D$ is the diagonal matrix
of outdegrees, and $A$ is the adjacency matrix. A consequence is that the sequence $(r_n)_{n \geq
1}$ completely determines the spectrum of the simple random walk on the network.

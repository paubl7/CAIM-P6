Rapid detection of spatial events that propagate across a sensor network is of wide interest in many
modern applications. In particular, in communications, radar, environmental monitoring, and
biosurveillance, we may observe propagating fields or particles. In this paper, we propose Bayesian
single and multiple change-point detection procedures for the rapid detection of propagating
spatial events. It is assumed that the spatial event propagates across a network of sensors according
to the physical properties of the source causing the event. The multisensor system configuration
is arbitrary and sensors may be mobile. We begin by considering a single spatial event and are interested
in detecting this event as quickly as possible, while statistically controlling the probability
of false alarm. Using a dynamic programming framework we derive the structure of the optimal procedure,
which minimizes the average detection delay (ADD) subject to a false alarm probability upper bound.
In the rare event regime, the optimal procedure converges to a more practical threshold test on the
posterior probability of the change point. A convenient recursive computation of this posterior
probability is derived by using the propagation pattern of the spatial event. The ADD of the posterior
probability threshold test is analyzed in the asymptotic regime. Then, we take a multiple hypothesis
testing (MHT) approach and develop a procedure for the detection of multiple propagating spatial
events in parallel. The proposed parallel procedure controls the overall false discovery rate
(FDR) under prespecified upper bound. Simulations are conducted to verify the theoretical findings.
It is shown that exploiting the spatial properties of the event improves the ADD compared to procedures
that do not properly take advantage of the spatial information.

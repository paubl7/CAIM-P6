We consider the problem of undirected polymers (tied at the endpoints) in random environment, also
known as the unoriented first passage percolation on the hypercube, in the limit of large dimensions.
By means of the multiscale refinement of the second moment method we obtain a fairly precise geometrical
description of optimal paths, i.e. of polymers with minimal energy. The picture which emerges can
be loosely summarized as follows. The energy of the polymer is, to first approximation, uniformly
spread along the strand. The polymer's bonds carry however a lower energy than in the directed setting,
and are reached through the following geometrical evolution. Close to the origin, the polymer proceeds
in oriented fashion -- it is thus as stretched as possible. The tension of the strand decreases however
gradually, with the polymer allowing for more and more backsteps as it enters the core of the hypercube.
Backsteps, although increasing the length of the strand, allow the polymer to connect reservoirs
of energetically favorable edges which are otherwise unattainable in a fully directed regime.
These reservoirs lie at mesoscopic distance apart, but in virtue of the high dimensional nature
of the ambient space, the polymer manages to connect them through approximate geodesics with respect
to the Hamming metric: this is the key strategy which leads to an optimal energy/entropy balance.
Around halfway, the mirror picture sets in: the polymer tension gradually builds up again, until
full orientedness close to the endpoint. The approach yields, as a corollary, a constructive proof
of the result by Martinsson [Ann. Appl. Prob. 26 (2016), Ann. Prob. 46 (2018)] concerning the leading
order of the ground state.

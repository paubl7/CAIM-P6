Rigidity is the property of a structure that does not flex. It is well studied in discrete geometry
and mechanics, and has applications in material science, engineering and biological sciences.
A bar-and-joint framework is a pair $(G,p)$ of graph $G$ together with a map $p$ of the vertices of
$G$ into the Euclidean plane. We view the edges of $(G, p)$ as bars and the vertices as universal joints.
The vertices can move continuously as long as the distances between pairs of adjacent vertices are
preserved. The framework is rigid if any such motion preserves the distances between all pairs of
vertices. In 1970, Laman obtained a combinatorial characterization of rigid graphs in the Euclidean
plane. In 1982, Lov\'asz and Yemini discovered a new characterization and proved that every $6$-connected
graph is rigid. Combined with a characterization of global rigidity, their proof actually implies
that every 6-connected graph is globally rigid. Consequently, if Fiedler's algebraic connectivity
is greater than 5, then $G$ is globally rigid. In this paper, we improve this bound and show that for
a graph $G$ with minimum degree $\delta\geq 6$, if its algebraic connectivity is greater than $2+\frac{1}{\delta
-1}$, then $G$ is rigid and if its algebraic connectivity is greater than $2+\frac{2}{\delta -1}$,
then $G$ is globally rigid. Our results imply that every connected regular Ramanujan graph with
degree at least $8$ is globally rigid. We also prove a more general result giving a sufficient spectral
condition for the existence of $k$ edge-disjoint spanning rigid subgraphs. The same condition
implies that a graph contains $k$ edge-disjoint spanning $2$-connected subgraphs. This result
extends previous spectral conditions for packing edge-disjoint spanning trees.

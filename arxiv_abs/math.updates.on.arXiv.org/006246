Range anxiety has been the main challenge for the mass-adoption of electric vehicles (EVs). The
emerging mobile electric-vehicle-to-electric-vehicle (mE2) charging technology, which allows
an EV with the extra battery to charge the other EV on the move, offers a promising solution. Even though
the physical feasibility of this new technology has been confirmed, we still face many operation
problems. For example, how can we efficiently pair and route an electricity provider (EP) to a demand
(ED) without introducing an extra detour? Motivated by this view, this study develops a Charging-as-a-Service
(CaaS) platform, which seeks to dispatches the commercial EPs to serve the EDs, for cultivating
this emerging charging service towards the low EV penetration environment. Mathematically, the
CaaS platform is modeled as a vehicle routing problem (i.e., mE2-VRP), which optimally dispatches
the EPs to approach and serve the EDs on the move while minimizing the EP fleet size and fulfilling
all service requests. To adapt the CaaS platform to the online application in practice, we develop
the Clustering-aided Clarke and Wright Savings (CCWS) algorithm to efficiently decompose and
then solve the large-scale mE2-VRP by parallel computing. Our numerical experiments built upon
citywide (Chicago) and statewide (Florida) found that the CCWS algorithm outperforms existing
commercial solvers, and it enables us to investigate the performance of the CaaS platform under
a realistic large-scale setup in a city or state. The CaaS performs better in low EV penetration markets
while traffic congestion is mild and EDs require energy earlier. We can improve the performance
by developing proper pricing strategies according to the EDs' energy requests and trip lengths.

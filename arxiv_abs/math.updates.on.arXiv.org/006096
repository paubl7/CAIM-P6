In this paper, we investigate the stability of five models of systems. In all the five models the damping
considered is fractional Kelvin-Voigt damping. In the first model, we consider a Euler-Bernoulli
beam and a wave equations coupled via boundary connections. The localized non-smooth fractional
Kelvin-Voigt damping acts through wave equation only, its effect is transmitted to the other equation
through the coupling by boundary connections. In this model, we reformulate the system into an augmented
model and using a general criteria of Arendt-Batty, we show that the system is strongly stable. By
using frequency domain approach, combined with multiplier technique we prove that the energy decays
polynomially with rate depends on the order of the fractional derivative. For the second model,
we consider two wave equations coupled through boundary connections with localized non-regular
fractional Kelvin-Voigt damping acting on one of the two equations. For the third model, we consider
coupled Euler-Bernoulli beam and wave equations through boundary connections with the same damping,
the dissipation acts through the beam equation. We prove using the same technique as for the first
model combined with some interpolation inequalities and by solving ordinary differential equations
of order 4, that the energy has a polynomial decay rate that depends in the order of the fractional
derivative. In the fourth model, we consider an Euler-Bernoulli beam with a localized non-regular
fractional Kelvin-Voigt damping. Finally, in the fifth model, we study the polynomial stability
of two Euler-Bernoulli beam equations coupled through boundary connection with a localized non-regular
fractional Kelvin-Voigt damping acting on one of the two equations. In these models, we prove that
the enrgy has a polynomial energy decay rate that depends on the order of the frcational derivative.

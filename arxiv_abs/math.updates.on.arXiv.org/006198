How does the chromatic number of a graph chosen uniformly at random from all graphs on $n$ vertices
behave? This quantity is a random variable, so one can ask (i) for bounds on its typical values, and
(ii) for bounds on how much it varies: what is the width (e.g., standard deviation) of its distribution?
On (i) there has been considerable progress over the last 45 years; on (ii), which is our focus here,
remarkably little. One would like both upper and lower bounds on the width of the distribution, and
ideally a description of the (appropriately scaled) limiting distribution. There is a well known
upper bound of Shamir and Spencer of order $\sqrt{n}$, improved slightly by Alon to $\sqrt{n}/\log
n$. In the other direction, the first non-trivial bound was proved by the first author in 2019, showing
that the width is at least $n^{1/4-o(1)}$ for some values of $n$, answering a longstanding question
of Bollob\'as. In this paper we have two main aims: first, we shall prove a much stronger lower bound
on the width. We shall show unconditionally that, for some values of $n$, the width is at least $n^{1/2-o(1)}$,
matching the upper bounds up to the error term. Moreover, conditional on a recently announced sharper
estimate for the chromatic number, we improve the lower bound to order $\sqrt{n} \log \log n /\log^{3.5}
n$, within a logarithmic factor of the upper bound. Secondly, we will describe a number of conjectures
as to what the true behaviour of the variation in the chromatic number is, and why. The first form of
this conjecture arises from recent work of Bollob\'as, Heckel, Morris, Panagiotou, Riordan and
Smith. We will also give much more detailed conjectures, suggesting that the true width, for the
worst case $n$, is of order $\sqrt{n}\log\log n/\log^3 n$, only a factor $\sqrt{\log n}$ larger
than our lower bound. These conjectures also predict a Gaussian limiting distribution.

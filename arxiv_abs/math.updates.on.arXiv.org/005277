Finding latent structures in data is drawing increasing attention in diverse fields such as fluid
dynamics, signal processing, and machine learning. Dimensionality reduction facilitates the
revelation of such structures. For dynamical systems of linear and nonlinear flows, a prominent
dimensionality reduction method is DMD, based on the theory of Koopman operators. In this work,
we adapt DMD to homogeneous flows and show it can approximate well nonlinear spectral image decomposition
techniques. We examine dynamics based on symmetric $\gamma$-homogeneous operators, $0 < \gamma
< 1$. These systems have a polynomial decay profile and reach steady state in finite time. DMD, on
the other hand, can be viewed as an exponential data fitting algorithm. This yields an inherent conflict,
causing large approximation errors (and non-existence of solutions in some particular cases).
The contribution of this work is threefold. First, we suggest a rescaling of the time variable that
solves the conflict between DMD and homogeneous flows. This adaptation of DMD can be performed when
the homogeneity and the time step size are known. Second, we suggest the blind homogeneity normalization
for time rescaling when neither the homogeneity nor the step size are known. Third, we formulate
a new dynamic mode decomposition that constrains the matrix of the dynamics to be symmetric, termed
SDMD. With these adaptations, we provide a closed form solution of DMD for dynamics $u_t = P(u) $,
$u(t=0)=u_0$, where $P$ is a nonlinear $\gamma$-homogeneous operator, when $u_0$ admits $P(u_0)=\lambda
u_0 $. Then, we prove the validity of the blind homogeneity normalization. In addition, we show SDMD
achieves lower mean square error for the spectrum estimation. Finally, we turn to formulating a
discrete nonlinear spectral decomposition, based on SDMD and related to nonlinear eigenfunctions
of $\gamma$-homogeneous operators.

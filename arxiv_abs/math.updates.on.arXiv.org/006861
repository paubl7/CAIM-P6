Despite major advancements in nonlinear programming (NLP) and convex relaxations, most system
operators around the world still predominantly use some form of linear programming (LP) approximation
of the AC power flow equations. This is largely due to LP technology's superior reliability and computational
efficiency, especially in real-time market applications, security-constrained applications,
and extensions involving integer variables, in addition to its ability to readily generate locational
marginal prices (LMP) for market applications. In the aim of leveraging the advantages of LP while
retaining the accuracy of NLP interior-point methods (IPMs), this paper proposes a sequential
linear programming (SLP) approach consisting of a sequence of carefully constructed supporting
hyperplanes and halfspaces. The algorithm is numerically demonstrated to converge on 138 test
cases with up the 3375 buses to feasible high-quality solutions (i) without AC feasibility restoration
(i.e., using LP solvers exclusively), (ii) in computation times generally within the same order
of magnitude as those from a state-of-the-art NLP solver, and (iii) with robustness against the
choice of starting point. In particular, the (relative) optimality gaps and the mean constraint
violations are on average around 1e-3% and 1e-7, respectively, under a single parameter setting
for all the 138 test cases. To the best of our knowledge, the proposed SLP approach is the first to use
LP exclusively to reach feasible and high-quality solutions to the nonconvex AC OPF in a reliable
way, which paves the way for system and market operators to keep using their LP solvers but now with
the ability to accurately capture transmission losses, price reactive power (Q-LMP), and obtain
more accurate LMP.

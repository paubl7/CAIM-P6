Accurate, fast, and reliable parameter estimation is crucial for modeling, control, and optimization
of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. In this paper, we focus on the two most widely used benchmark
datasets and try to answer (i) whether the global minimum in terms of root mean square error (RMSE)
has already been reached; and (ii) whether a significantly simpler metaheuristic, in contrast
to currently sophisticated ones, is capable of identifying PV parameters with comparable performance,
e.g., attaining the same RMSE. We address the former using an interval analysis based branch and
bound algorithm and certify the global minimum rigorously for the single diode model (SDM) as well
as locating a fairly tight upper bound for the double diode model (DDM) on both datasets. These obtained
values will serve as useful references for metaheuristic methods, since none of them can guarantee
or recognize the global minimum even if they have literally discovered it. However, this algorithm
is excessively slow and unsuitable for time-sensitive applications (despite the great insights
on RMSE that it yields). Regarding the second question, extensive examination and comparison reveal
that, perhaps surprisingly, a classic and remarkably simple differential evolution (DE) algorithm
can consistently achieve the certified global minimum for the SDM and obtain the best known result
for the DDM on both datasets. Thanks to its extreme simplicity, the DE algorithm takes only a fraction
of the running time required by other contemporary metaheuristics and is thus preferable in real-time
scenarios. This unusual (and certainly notable) finding also indicates that the employment of
increasingly complicated metaheuristics might possibly be somewhat overkill for regular PV parameter
estimation. Finally, we discuss the implications of these results and suggest promising directions
for future development.

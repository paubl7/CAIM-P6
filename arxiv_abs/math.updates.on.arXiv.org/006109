The Poisson-Boltzmann equation (PBE) is a fundamental implicit solvent continuum model for calculating
the electrostatic potential of large ionic solvated biomolecules. However, its numerical solution
encounters severe challenges arising from its strong singularity and nonlinearity. In [1,2],
the effect of strong singularities was eliminated by applying the range-separated (RS) canonical
tensor format [3,4] to construct a solution decomposition scheme for the PBE. The RS tensor format
allows to derive a smooth approximation to the Dirac delta distribution in order to obtain a regularized
PBE (RPBE) model. However, solving the RPBE is still computationally demanding due to its high dimension
$\mathcal{N}$, where $\mathcal{N}$ is always in the millions. In this study, we propose to apply
the reduced basis method (RBM) and the (discrete) empirical interpolation method ((D)EIM) to the
RPBE in order to construct a reduced order model (ROM) of low dimension $N \ll \mathcal{N}$, whose
solution accurately approximates the nonlinear RPBE. The long-range potential can be obtained
by lifting the ROM solution back to the $\mathcal{N}$-space while the short-range potential is
directly precomputed analytically, thanks to the RS tensor format. The sum of both provides the
total electrostatic potential. The main computational benefit is the avoidance of computing the
numerical approximation of the singular electrostatic potential. We demonstrate in the numerical
experiments, the accuracy and efficacy of the reduced basis (RB) approximation to the nonlinear
RPBE (NRPBE) solution and the corresponding computational savings over the classical nonlinear
PBE (NPBE) as well as over the RBM being applied to the classical NPBE.

The eastern oyster is a keystone species and ecosystem engineer. However, restoration efforts
of wild oysters are often unsuccessful, in that they do not produce a robust population of oysters
that are able to successfully reproduce. Furthermore, the dynamics of wild oyster fertilization
is not yet well understood. Through conducting an experiment predicated on quantifying the influence
of elementary aspects of fertilization kinetics--sperm concentration, gamete age, and success
rate--we found that, as stochastic as the mating process may seem, there are correlations which
fundamentally serve as the framework for assessing long-term sustainability, reef structure,
and hydrodynamic parameters in relation to fertilization. We then focused on mathematically defining
a procedure which simulated a concentration distribution of a single sperm and egg release where
there existed conditions necessary for breeding to take place. We found a very significant impact
of both gamete age and sperm concentration on fertilization rate ($p < 0.0001$). Our hydrodynamic
model demonstrates that distance can also drastically influence broadcast spawning. This could
be used as a foundation for developing a flexible model for wild oyster fertilization based on placement,
initial seawater conditions, and size of the starting population. The results of this research
could be implemented into a more user-friendly program which would accept multiple variables as
inputs and output the probability of fertilization given arbitrary values. By accounting for environmental
deviations, this generalization would increase its compatibility with the public and actualize
the project's intended purpose: enhance the planning of oyster reef restoration projects.

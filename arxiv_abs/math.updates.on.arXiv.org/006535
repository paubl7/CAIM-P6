We obtain sufficient conditions for the emergence of spanning and almost-spanning bounded-degree
{\sl rainbow} trees in various host graphs, having their edges coloured independently and uniformly
at random, using a predetermined palette. Our first result asserts that a uniform colouring of $\mathbb{G}(n,\omega(1)/n)$,
using a palette of size $n$, a.a.s. admits a rainbow copy of any given bounded-degree tree on at most
$(1-\varepsilon)n$ vertices, where $\varepsilon > 0$ is arbitrarily small yet fixed. This serves
as a rainbow variant of a classical result by Alon, Krivelevich, and Sudakov pertaining to the embedding
of bounded-degree almost-spanning prescribed trees in $\mathbb{G}(n,C/n)$, where $C > 0$ is independent
of $n$. Given an $n$-vertex graph $G$ with minimum degree at least $\delta n$, where $\delta > 0$ is
fixed, we use our aforementioned result in order to prove that a uniform colouring of the randomly
perturbed graph $G \cup \mathbb{G}(n,\omega(1)/n)$, using $(1+\alpha)n$ colours, where $\alpha
> 0$ is arbitrarily small yet fixed, a.a.s. admits a rainbow copy of any given bounded-degree {\sl
spanning} tree. This can be viewed as a rainbow variant of a result by Krivelevich, Kwan, and Sudakov
who proved that $G \cup \mathbb{G}(n,C/n)$, where $C > 0$ is independent of $n$, a.a.s. admits a copy
of any given bounded-degree spanning tree. Finally, and with $G$ as above, we prove that a uniform
colouring of $G \cup \mathbb{G}(n,\omega(n^{-2}))$ using $n-1$ colours a.a.s. admits a rainbow
spanning tree. Put another way, the trivial lower bound on the size of the palette required for supporting
a rainbow spanning tree is also sufficient, essentially as soon as the random perturbation a.a.s.
has edges.

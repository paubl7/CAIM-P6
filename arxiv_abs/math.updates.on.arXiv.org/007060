It is well-known that the "hit" problem for a module over the mod 2 Steenrod algebra $\mathscr A$ is
an interesting and important open problem of Algebraic topology, which asks a minimal set of generators
for the polynomial algebra $\mathcal P_m:=\mathbb F_2[x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_m]$, regarded as a connected
unstable $\mathscr A$-module on $m$ variables $x_1, \ldots, x_m,$ each of degree 1. Although this
problem has been thoroughly studied for more than 3 decades, solving it remains a mystery for $m\geq
5.$ The aim of this work is of studying the hit problem of five variables. More precisely, we develop
our previous work [Commun. Korean Math. Soc. 35 (2020), 371-399] on the hit problem for $\mathscr
A$-module $\mathcal P_5$ in a degree of the generic form $n_t:=5(2^t-1) + 18.2^t,$ for any non-negative
integer $t.$ An efficient approach to solve this problem had been presented. Moreover, we provide
an algorithm in MAGMA for verifying the results and studying the hit problem in general. As an consequence,
the calculations confirmed Sum's conjecture [Algebraic Topology and Related Topics. Trends in
Mathematics. (2019), 265-286] for the relationship between the minimal sets of $\mathscr A$-generators
of the polynomial algebras $\mathcal P_{m-1}$ and $\mathcal P_{m}$ in the case $m=5$ and degree
$n_t.$ Two applications of this study are to determine the dimension of $\mathcal P_6$ in the generic
degree $5(2^{t+4}-1) + n_1.2^{t+4}$ for all $t > 0$ and describe the modular representations of
the general linear group of rank 5 over $\mathbb F_2.$ As a corollary, the cohomological "transfer",
defined by W. Singer [Math. Z. 202 (1989), 493-523], is an isomorphism at the bidegree $(5, 5+n_0).$
Singer's transfer is one of the relatively efficient tools to approach the structure of mod-2 cohomology
of the Steenrod algebra.

In this paper, we set up the theoretical foundations for a high-dimensional functional factor model
approach in the analysis of large cross-sections (panels) of functional time series (FTS). We first
establish a representation result stating that, under mild assumptions on the covariance operator
of the cross-section, we can represent each FTS as the sum of a common component driven by scalar factors
loaded via functional loadings, and a mildly cross-correlated idiosyncratic component. Our model
and theory are developed in a general Hilbert space setting that allows for mixed panels of functional
and scalar time series. We then turn to the identification of the number of factors, and the estimation
of the factors, their loadings, and the common components. We provide a family of information criteria
for identifying the number of factors, and prove their consistency. We provide average error bounds
for the estimators of the factors, loadings, and common component; our results encompass the scalar
case, for which they reproduce and extend, under weaker conditions, well-established similar
results. Under slightly stronger assumptions, we also provide uniform bounds for the estimators
of factors, loadings, and common component, thus extending existing scalar results. Our consistency
results in the asymptotic regime where the number $N$ of series and the number $T$ of time observations
diverge thus extend to the functional context the "blessing of dimensionality" that explains the
success of factor models in the analysis of high-dimensional (scalar) time series. We provide numerical
illustrations that corroborate the convergence rates predicted by the theory, and provide finer
understanding of the interplay between $N$ and $T$ for estimation purposes. We conclude with an
application to forecasting mortality curves, where we demonstrate that our approach outperforms
existing methods.

This study derives a method to consistently recover the second-order convergence of the lattice
Boltzmann method (LBM), which is frequently degraded by the improper discretisation of required
source terms. The work focuses on advection-diffusion models in which the source terms are dependent
on the intensity of transported fields. The main findings are applicable to a wide range of formulations
within the LBM framework. All considered source terms are interpreted as contributions to the zeroth-moment
of the distribution function. These account for sources in a scalar field, such as density, concentration
or temperature. In addition to this, certain immersed boundary methods can be interpreted as a source
term in their formulation, highlighting a further application for this work. This paper makes three
primary contributions to the current state-of-the-art. Firstly, it identifies the differences
observed between the ways source terms are included in the LBM schemes present in the literature.
The algebraic manipulations are explicitly presented in this paper to clarify the differences
observed, and identify their origin. Secondly, it derives in full detail, the implicit relation
between the value of the transported macroscopic field, and the sum of the LBM densities. Moreover,
this relation is valid for any source term discretization scheme, and three equivalent forms of
the second-order accurate collision operator are presented. Finally, closed-form solutions
of this implicit relation are shown for a variety of common models. The second-order convergence
of the proposed LBM schemes is verified on both linear and non-linear source terms. Commonly used
diffusive and acoustic scalings are discussed, and their pitfalls are identified. Moreover, for
a simplified case, the competing errors are shown visually with isolines of error in the space of
spatial and temporal resolutions.

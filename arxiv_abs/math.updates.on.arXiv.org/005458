A homotopy motion of a subspace $\Sigma$ in a manifold $M$ is a homotopy $\{f_t\}_{t\in I}: \Sigma
\times [0,1] \to M$ such that $f_0$ is the inclusion map and $f_1$ is an embedding with image $\Sigma$.
The homotopy motion group $\Pi(M,\Sigma)$ is the group made up of the equivalence classes of homotopy
motions of $\Sigma$ in $M$. There is a natural map from $\Pi(M,\Sigma)$ to the mapping class group
of $\Sigma$ that assigns a homotopy motion $\{f_t\}_{t\in I}$ with its terminal end $f_1$: we denote
its kernel and image by $\mathcal{K}(M,\Sigma)$ and $\Gamma (M,\Sigma)$, respectively. This
paper is devoted to the study of those groups for the case where $\Sigma$ is a closed, orientable surface
in a closed, orientable $3$-manifold $M$. For the two extremal cases where (a) $M$ is Haken and $\Sigma$
is incompressible and where (b) $M$ is aspherical and $\Sigma$ is homotopically trivial, we give
their complete descriptions. These groups are particularly interesting when $\Sigma$ is a Heegaard
surface, and a main result is as follows. If $M$ is aspherical and if $\Sigma$ is induced from an open
book decomposition of $M$, then there is a gap between the group $\Gamma (M,\Sigma)$ and its natural
subgroup that appears in a problem proposed by Minsky, studied by Bowditch-Ohshika-Sakuma, and
whose analogue plays essential roles in the study of $2$-bridge knot groups. To show this, we introduce
the notion of a $\Sigma$-domination and study its existence for the pair $(M, \Sigma)$, which is
of independent interest. We also give a refinement of the virtual branched fibration theorem for
$(M,\Sigma)$, which says that $M$ has $\Sigma$-bundles over $S^1$ as double branched covers, with
characterizing the monodromies of such $\Sigma$-bundles as special elements of $\Gamma (M,\Sigma)$.

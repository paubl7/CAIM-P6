We study the local geometry of 4-manifolds equipped with a \emph{para-K\"ahler-Einstein} (pKE)
metric, a special type of split-signature pseudo-Riemannian metric, and their associated \emph{twistor
distribution}, a rank 2 distribution on the 5-dimensional total space of the circle bundle of self-dual
null 2-planes. For pKE metrics with nonvanishing Einstein constant this twistor distribution
has exactly two integral leaves and is `maximally non-integrable' on their complement, a so-called
(2,3,5)-distribution. Our main result establishes a simple correspondence between the anti-self-dual
Weyl tensor of a pKE metric with non-vanishing Einstein constant and the Cartan quartic of the associated
twistor distribution. This will be followed by a discussion of this correspondence for general
split-signature metrics which is shown to be much more involved. We use Cartan's method of equivalence
to produce a large number of explicit examples of pKE metrics with nonvanishing Einstein constant
whose anti-self-dual Weyl tensor have special real Petrov type. In the case of real Petrov type $D,$
we obtain a complete local classification. Combined with the main result, this produces twistor
distributions whose Cartan quartic has the same algebraic type as the Petrov type of the constructed
pKE metrics. In a similar manner, one can obtain twistor distributions with Cartan quartic of arbitrary
algebraic type. As a byproduct of our pKE examples we naturally obtain para-Sasaki-Einstein metrics
in five dimensions. Furthermore, we study various Cartan geometries naturally associated to certain
classes of pKE 4-dimensional metrics. We observe that in some geometrically distinguished cases
the corresponding \emph{Cartan connections} satisfy the Yang-Mills equations. We then provide
explicit examples of such Yang-Mills Cartan connections.

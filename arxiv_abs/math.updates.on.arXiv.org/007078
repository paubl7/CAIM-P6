This paper gives a localized method for the multi-commodity flow problem. We relax both the capacity
constraints and flow conservation constraints, and introduce a $congestion$ function $\psi$
for each arc and $height$ function $h$ for each vertex and commodity. If the flow exceeds the capacity
on arc $a$, arc $a$ would have a congestion cost. If the flow into the vertex $i$ is not equal to that
out of the vertex for commodity $k$, vertex $i$ would have a height, which is positively related to
the difference between the amount of the commodity $k$ into the vertex $i$ and that out of the vertex.
Based on the height function $h$ and the congestion function $\psi$, a new conception , $stable$
$pseudo$-$flow$, is introduced, which satisfies the following conditions: ($\mathrm{i}$) for
any used arc of commodity $k$, the height difference between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$ is equal to
the congestion of arc $(i,j)$; ($\mathrm{ii}$) for any unused arc of commodity $k$, the height difference
between vertex $i$ and vertex $j$ is less than or equal to the congestion of arc $(i,j)$. If the stable
pseudo-flow is a nonzero-stable pseudo-flow, there exists no feasible solution for the multi-commodity
flow problem; if the stable pseudo-flow is a zero-stable pseudo-flow, there exists feasible solution
for the multi-commodity flow problem and the zero-stable pseudo-flow is the feasible solution.
Besides, a non-linear description of the multi-commodity flow problem is given, whose solution
is stable pseudo-flow. And the non-linear description could be rewritten as convex quadratic programming
with box constraints. Rather than examine the entire network to find path, the conclusion in this
paper shows that the multi-commodity flow problem could be solved in a localized manner by looking
only at the vertex and its neighbors.

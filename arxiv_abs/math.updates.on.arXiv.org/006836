The objective of this paper is two-fold. First, we establish new sharp quantitative estimates for
Faber-Krahn inequalities on simply connected space forms. In these spaces, geodesic balls uniquely
minimize the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet Laplacian among all sets of a fixed volume. We prove
that for any open set $\Omega$, \[ \lambda_1(\Omega) - \lambda_1(B) \gtrsim |\Omega \Delta B|^2
+ \int |u_{\Omega} - u_B|^2, \] where $B$ denotes the nearest geodesic ball to $\Omega$ with $|B|=|\Omega|$
and $u_\Omega$ denotes the first eigenfunction with suitable normalization. On Euclidean space,
this extends a result of Brasco-De Phillipis-Velichkov; the eigenfunction control largely builds
upon on new regularity results for minimizers of critically perturbed Alt-Cafarelli type functionals
in our companion paper. On the round sphere and hyperbolic space, the present results are the first
sharp quantitative results with respect to any distance; here the local portion of the analysis
is based on new implicit spectral analysis techniques. Second, we apply these sharp quantitative
Faber-Krahn inequalities in order to establish a quantitative form of the Alt-Caffarelli-Friedman
(ACF) monotonicity formula. A powerful tool in the study of free boundary problems, the ACF monotonicity
formula is nonincreasing with respect to its scaling parameter for any pair of admissible subharmonic
functions, and is constant if and only if the pair comprises two linear functions truncated to complementary
half planes. We show that the energy drop in the ACF monotonicity formula from one scale to the next
controls how close a pair of admissible functions is from a pair of complementary half-plane solutions.
In particular, when the square root of the energy drop summed over all scales is small, our result
implies the existence of tangents (unique blowups) of these functions.

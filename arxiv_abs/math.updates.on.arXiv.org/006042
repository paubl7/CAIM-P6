Large deviation behavior of the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$ of Gaussian networks (Erd\H{o}s-R\'enyi
random graphs $\mathcal{G}_{n,p}$ with i.i.d. Gaussian weights on the edges) has been the topic
of considerable interest. Recently in [6,30], a powerful approach was introduced based on tilting
measures by suitable spherical integrals, particularly establishing a non-universal large deviation
behavior for fixed $p<1$ compared to the standard Gaussian ($p=1$) case. The case when $p\to 0$ was
however completely left open with one expecting the dense behavior to hold only until the average
degree is logarithmic in $n$. In this article we focus on the case of constant average degree i.e.,
$p=\frac{d}{n}$. We prove the following results towards a precise understanding of the large deviation
behavior in this setting. 1. (Upper tail probabilities): For $\delta>0,$ we pin down the exact exponent
$\psi(\delta)$ such that $$\mathbb{P}(\lambda_1\ge \sqrt{2(1+\delta)\log n})=n^{-\psi(\delta)+o(1)}.$$
Further, we show that conditioned on the upper tail event, with high probability, a unique maximal
clique emerges with a very precise $\delta$ dependent size (takes either one or two possible values)
and the Gaussian weights are uniformly high in absolute value on the edges in the clique. Finally,
we also prove an optimal localization result for the leading eigenvector, showing that it allocates
most of its mass on the aforementioned clique which is spread uniformly across its vertices. 2. (Lower
tail probabilities): The exact stretched exponential behavior of $\mathbb{P}(\lambda_1\le
\sqrt{2(1-\delta)\log n})$ is also established. As an immediate corollary, we get $\lambda_1
\approx \sqrt{2 \log n}$ typically, a result that surprisingly appears to be new. A key ingredient
is an extremal spectral theory for weighted graphs obtained via the classical Motzkin-Straus theorem.

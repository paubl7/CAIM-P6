This work (Part (I)) together with its companion (Part (II) [45]) develops a new framework for stochastic
functional Kolmogorov equations, which are nonlinear stochastic differential equations depending
on the current as well as the past states. Because of the complexity of the results, it seems to be instructive
to divide our contributions to two parts. In contrast to the existing literature, our effort is to
advance the knowledge by allowing delay and past dependence, yielding essential utility to a wide
range of applications. A long-standing question of fundamental importance pertaining to biology
and ecology is: What are the minimal necessary and sufficient conditions for long-term persistence
and extinction (or for long-term coexistence of interacting species) of a population? Regardless
of the particular applications encountered, persistence and extinction are properties shared
by Kolmogorov systems. While there are many excellent treaties of stochastic-differential-equation-based
Kolmogorov equations, the work on stochastic Kolmogorov equations with past dependence is still
scarce. Our aim here is to answer the aforementioned basic question. This work, Part (I), is devoted
to characterization of persistence, whereas its companion, Part (II) [45], is devoted to extinction.
The main techniques used in this paper include the newly developed functional It^o formula and asymptotic
coupling and Harris-like theory for infinite dimensional systems specialized to functional equations.
General theorems for stochastic functional Kolmogorov equations are developed first. Then a number
of applications are examined to obtain new results substantially covering, improving, and extending
the existing literature. Furthermore, these conditions reduce to that of Kolmogorov systems when
there is no past dependence.

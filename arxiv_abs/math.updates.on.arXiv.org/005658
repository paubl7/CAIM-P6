Although the idea of using wireless links for covering large areas is not new, the advent of LPWANs
has recently started changing the game. Simple, robust, narrowband modulation schemes permit
the implementation of low-cost radio devices offering high receiver sensitivity, thus improving
the overall link budget. The several technologies belonging to the LPWAN family, including the
well-known LoRaWAN solution, provide a cost-effective answer to many Internet-of-things (IoT)
applications, requiring wireless communication capable of supporting large networks of many
devices (e.g., smart metering). Generally, the adopted MAC strategy is based on pure ALOHA, which,
among other things, allows to minimize the traffic overhead under constrained duty cycle limitations
of the unlicensed bands. Unfortunately, ALOHA suffers from poor scalability, rapidly collapsing
in dense networks. This work investigates the design of an improved LoRaWAN MAC scheme based on slotted
ALOHA. In particular, the required time dissemination is provided by out-of-band communications
leveraging on FM-RDS broadcasting. An experimental setup based on low-cost hardware is used to
characterize the obtainable synchronization performance and derive a timing error model. Consequently,
improvements in success probability and energy efficiency have been validated by means of simulations
in very large networks with up to 10000 nodes. It is shown that the advantage of the proposed scheme
over conventional LoRaWAN communication is up to 100% when short update time and large payload are
required. Similar results are obtained regarding the energy efficiency improvement, which is
close to 100% for relatively short transmission intervals and long message duration; however,
due to the additional overhead for listening to the time dissemination messages, efficiency gain
can be negative for short-duration messages fastly repeating.

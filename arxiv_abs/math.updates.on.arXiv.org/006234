Intelligent reflection surface (IRS) is emerging as a promising technique for future wireless
communications. Considering its excellent capability in customizing the channel conditions
via energy-focusing and energy-nulling, it is an ideal technique for enhancing wireless communication
security and privacy, through the theories of physical layer security and covert communications,
respectively. In this article, we first present some results on applying IRS to improve the average
secrecy rate in wiretap channels, to enable perfect communication covertness, and to deliberately
create extra randomness in wireless propagations for hiding active wireless transmissions. Then,
we identify multiple challenges for future research to fully unlock the benefits offered by IRS
in the context of physical layer security and covert communications. With the aid of extensive numerical
studies, we demonstrate the necessity of designing the amplitudes of the IRS elements in wireless
communications with the consideration of security and privacy, where the optimal values are not
always $1$ as commonly adopted in the literature. Furthermore, we reveal the tradeoff between the
achievable secrecy performance and the estimation accuracy of the IRS's channel state information
(CSI) at both the legitimate and malicious users, which presents the fundamental resource allocation
challenge in the context of IRS-aided physical layer security. Finally, a passive channel estimation
methodology exploiting deep neural networks and scene images is discussed as a potential solution
to enabling CSI availability without utilizing resource-hungry pilots. This methodology serves
as a visible pathway to significantly improving the covert communication rate in IRS-aided wireless
networks.

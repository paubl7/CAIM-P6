Wireless communications with extremely large-scale array (XL-array) correspond to systems whose
antenna sizes are so large that conventional modelling assumptions, such as uniform plane wave
(UPW) impingement, are longer valid. This paper studies the mathematical modelling and performance
analysis of XL-array communications. By deviating from the conventional modelling approach that
treats the array elements as sizeless points, we explicitly model their physical area/aperture,
which enables a unified modelling for the classical discrete antenna arrays and the emerging continuous
surfaces. As such, a generic array/surface model that accurately takes into account the variations
of signal phase, amplitude and projected aperture across array elements is proposed. Based on the
proposed model, a closed-form expression of the resulting SNR with the optimal single-user MRC/MRT
beamforming is derived. The expression reveals that instead of scaling linearly with the antenna
number M as in conventional UPW modelling, the SNR with the more generic model increases with M with
diminishing return, which is governed by the collective properties of the array, such as the array
occupation ratio and the physical sizes of the array along each dimension, while irrespective of
the properties of the individual array element. Additionally, we have derived an alternative insightful
expression for the optimal SNR in terms of the vertical and horizontal angular spans. Furthermore,
we also show that our derived results include the far-field UPW modelling as a special case. One important
finding during the study of far-field approximation is the necessity to introduce a new distance
criterion to complement the classical Rayleigh distance, termed uniform-power distance (UPD),
which concerns the signal amplitude/power variations across array elements, instead of phase
variations as for Rayleigh distance.

In this paper, with the parametric symmetric coercive elliptic boundary value problem as an example
of the primal-dual variational problems satisfying the strong duality, we develop primal-dual
reduced basis methods (PD-RBM) with robust true error certifications and discuss three versions
of greedy algorithms to balance the finite element error, the exact reduced basis error, and the
adaptive mesh refinements. For a class of convex minimization variational problems which has corresponding
dual problems satisfying the strong duality, the primal-dual gap between the primal and dual functionals
can be used as a posteriori error estimator. This primal-dual gap error estimator is robust with
respect to the parameters of the problem, and it can be used for both mesh refinements of finite element
methods and the true RB error certification. With the help of integrations by parts formula, the
primal-dual variational theory is developed for the symmetric coercive elliptic boundary value
problems with non-homogeneous boundary conditions by both the conjugate function and Lagrangian
theories. A generalized Prager-Synge identity, which is the primal-dual gap error representation
for this specific problem, is developed. RBMs for both the primal and dual problems with robust error
estimates are developed. The dual variational problem often can be viewed as a constraint optimization
problem. In the paper, different from the standard saddle-point finite element approximation,
the dual RBM is treated as a Galerkin projection by constructing RB spaces satisfying the homogeneous
constraint. Inspired by the greedy algorithm with spatio-parameter adaptivity of \cite{Yano:18},
adaptive balanced greedy algorithms with primal-dual finite element and reduced basis error estimators
are discussed. Numerical tests are presented to test the PD-RBM with adaptive balanced greedy algorithms.

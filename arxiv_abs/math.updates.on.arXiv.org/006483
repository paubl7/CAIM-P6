In this paper, we consider coordinated control of feeder vehicles for first and last mode transportation.
The model is macroscopic with volumes of demands and supplies along with flows of vehicles. We propose
a one-shot problem for transportation of demand to or from a hub within a fixed time window, assuming
the knowledge of the demand and supply configurations. We present a unified optimization framework
that is applicable for both operator profit maximization and social welfare maximization. The
latter goal is useful for applications such as disaster response. The decision variables in the
optimization problem are routing and allocations of the vehicles for different services. With
K.K.T. analysis we propose an offline method for reducing the problem size. Further, we also analyze
the problem of maximizing profits by optimally locating the supply for a given total supply and present
a closed form expression of the maximum profits that can be earned over all supply configurations
for a given demand configuration. We also show an equivalence between optimal supply location in
the first mode problem and the last mode problem. We present a model for pricing based on the cost and
travel time of the best alternate transportation and present necessary conditions for the feeder
service to be viable. We illustrate the results through simulations and also compare the proposed
model with a traditional vehicle routing problem. Through simulations, we also compare with the
microscopic version of the problem with the decision variables being integers. We demonstrate
that the route reduction algorithm proposed for the macroscopic formulation is still useful for
computing nearly optimal solutions to the microscopic problem with much improved computational
efficiency.

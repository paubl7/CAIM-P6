About 26% of total U.S. energy consumption is used in the transportation sector. Conventional vehicles
use fuels such as gasoline, emit harmful gases, and have adverse effects on the environment. Electric
vehicles (EVs) provide an alternative solution that decreases the dependency on traditional fuels
such as gasoline and reduces hazardous gas emissions. EVs can drive longer distances by employing
dynamic wireless power transfer systems (DWPT) without increasing their battery size or having
stopovers. Additionally, developing a decision system that avoids an excessive load on the power
grid is essential. These decision systems are particularly beneficial for autonomous driving
for personal and public transportation. This study briefly reviews the available literature in
dynamic wireless power transfer systems and proposes a novel system-level mathematical decision
model to find the optimal profile for wireless charging infrastructures. We analyze the role of
renewable energy integration on DWPT systems and identify the framework, benefits, and challenges
in implementing DWPT for EVs. The mathematical model is mixed-integer, multi-period, and linear,
minimizing the total system cost while satisfying the systems requirements. The proposed model
and the case study analysis in this research determine the near-optimal plan for DWPT infrastructure
allocations and pave the road toward a more detailed power grid and renewable energy integration.
Our result indicates that renewable energies can significantly decrease the DWPT total system
cost, infrastructure requirements and increase the EVs' reliability. Keywords: Dynamic wireless

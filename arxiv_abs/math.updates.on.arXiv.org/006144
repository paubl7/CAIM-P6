There is growing interest in hydrogen (H$_2$) use for long-duration energy storage in a future electric
grid dominated by variable renewable energy (VRE) resources. Modelling the role of H$_2$ as grid-scale
energy storage, often referred as "power-to-gas-to-power (P2G2P)" overlooks the cost-sharing
and emission benefits from using the deployed H$_2$ production and storage assets to also supply
H$_2$ for decarbonizing other end-use sectors where direct electrification may be challenged.
Here, we develop a generalized modelling framework for co-optimizing energy infrastructure investment
and operation across power and transportation sectors and the supply chains of electricity and
H$_2$, while accounting for spatio-temporal variations in energy demand and supply. Applying
this sector-coupling framework to the U.S. Northeast under a range of technology cost and carbon
price scenarios, we find a greater value of power-to-H$_2$ (P2G) versus P2G2P routes. P2G provides
flexible demand response, while the extra cost and efficiency penalties of P2G2P routes make the
solution less attractive for grid balancing. The effects of sector-coupling are significant,
boosting VRE generation by 12-55% with both increased capacities and reduced curtailments and
reducing the total system cost (or levelized costs of energy) by 6-14% under 96% decarbonization
scenarios. Both the cost savings and emission reductions from sector coupling increase with H$_2$
demand for other end-uses, more than doubling for a 96% decarbonization scenario as H$_2$ demand
quadraples. Moreover, we found that the deployment of carbon capture and storage is more cost-effective
in the H$_2$ sector because of the lower cost and higher utilization rate. These findings highlight
the importance of using an integrated multi-sector energy system framework with multiple energy
vectors in planning energy system decarbonization pathways.

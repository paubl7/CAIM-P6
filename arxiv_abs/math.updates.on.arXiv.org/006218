This paper is the first in a series in which we offer a new framework for hermitian K-theory in the realm
of stable $\infty$-categories. Our perspective yields solutions to a variety of classical problems
involving Grothendieck-Witt groups of rings and clarifies the behaviour of these invariants when
2 is not invertible. In this article we lay the foundations of our approach by considering Lurie's
notion of a Poincar\'e $\infty$-category, which permits an abstract counterpart of unimodular
forms called Poincar\'e objects. We analyse the special cases of hyperbolic and metabolic Poincar\'e
objects, and establish a version of Ranicki's algebraic Thom construction. For derived $\infty$-categories
of rings, we classify all Poincar\'e structures and study in detail the process of deriving them
from classical input, thereby locating the usual setting of forms over rings within our framework.
We also develop the example of visible Poincar\'e structures on $\infty$-categories of parametrised
spectra, recovering the visible signature of a Poincar\'e duality space. We conduct a thorough
investigation of the global structural properties of Poincar\'e $\infty$-categories, showing
in particular that they form a bicomplete, closed symmetric monoidal $\infty$-category. We also
study the process of tensoring and cotensoring a Poincar\'e $\infty$-category over a finite simplicial
complex, a construction featuring prominently in the definition of the L- and Grothendieck-Witt
spectra that we consider in the next instalment. Finally, we define already here the 0-th Grothendieck-Witt
group of a Poincar\'e $\infty$-category using generators and relations. We extract its basic properties,
relating it in particular to the 0-th L- and algebraic K-groups, a relation upgraded in the second
instalment to a fibre sequence of spectra which plays a key role in our applications.

The contributions of independent noise sources to the variability of action potential timing has
not previously been studied at the level of individual directed molecular transitions within a
conductance-based model ion-state graph. The underlying connection provides an important example
of how mathematics can be applied to study the effects of unobservable microscopic fluctuations
to macroscopically observable quantities. We study a stochastic Langevin model and show how to
resolve the individual contributions that each transition in the ion channel graph makes to the
variance of the interspike interval (ISI). We extend the mean--return-time (MRT) phase reduction
developed in (Cao et al. 2020, SIAM J. Appl. Math) to the second moment of the return time from an MRT
isochron to itself. Because fixed-voltage spike-detection triggers do not correspond to MRT isochrons,
the inter-phase interval (IPI) variance only approximates the ISI variance. We find the IPI variance
and ISI variance agree to within a few percent when both can be computed. Moreover, we prove rigorously,
and show numerically, that our expression for the IPI variance is accurate in the small noise (large
system size) regime; our theory is exact in the limit of small noise. By selectively including the
noise associated with only those few transitions responsible for most of the ISI variance, our analysis
extends the stochastic shielding (SS) paradigm (Schmandt et al. 2012, Phys. Rev. Lett.) from the
stationary voltage-clamp case to the current-clamp case. We show numerically that the SS approximation
has a high degree of accuracy even for larger, physiologically relevant noise levels. We show that
the ISI variance is not an unambiguously defined quantity, but depends on the choice of voltage level
set as the spike-detection threshold, both in vitro and in silico.

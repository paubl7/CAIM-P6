In recent years, the notion of rank metric in the context of coding theory has known many interesting
developments in terms of applications such as space time coding, network coding or public key cryptography.
These applications raised the interest of the community for theoretical properties of this type
of codes, such as the hardness of decoding in rank metric or better decoding algorithms. Among classical
problems associated to codes for a given metric, the notion of code equivalence has always been of
the greatest interest. In this article, we discuss the hardness of the code equivalence problem
in rank metric for $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$--linear and general rank metric codes. In the $\mathbb{F}_{q^m}$--linear
case, we reduce the underlying problem to another one called Matrix Codes Right Equivalence Problem
(MCREP). We prove the latter problem to be either in $\mathcal{P}$ or in $\mathcal{ZPP}$ depending
of the ground field size. This is obtained by designing an algorithm whose principal routines are
linear algebra and factoring polynomials over finite fields. It turns out that the most difficult
instances involve codes with non trivial stabilizer algebras. The resolution of the latter case
will involve tools related to finite dimensional algebras and the so--called Wedderburn--Artin
theory. It is interesting to note that 30 years ago, an important trend in theoretical computer science
consisted to design algorithms making effective major results of this theory. These algorithmic
results turn out to be particularly useful in the present article. Finally, for general matrix codes,
we prove that the equivalence problem (both left and right) is at least as hard as the well--studied
{\em Monomial Equivalence Problem} for codes endowed with the Hamming metric.

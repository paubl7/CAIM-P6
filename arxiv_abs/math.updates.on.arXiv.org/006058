The von Neumann graph entropy is a measure of graph complexity based on the Laplacian spectrum. It
has recently found applications in various learning tasks driven by networked data. However, it
is computational demanding and hard to interpret using simple structural patterns. Due to the close
relation between Lapalcian spectrum and degree sequence, we conjecture that the structural information,
defined as the Shannon entropy of the normalized degree sequence, might be a good approximation
of the von Neumann graph entropy that is both scalable and interpretable. In this work, we thereby
study the difference between the structural information and von Neumann graph entropy named as
{\em entropy gap}. Based on the knowledge that the degree sequence is majorized by the Laplacian
spectrum, we for the first time prove the entropy gap is between $0$ and $\log_2 e$ in any undirected
unweighted graphs. Consequently we certify that the structural information is a good approximation
of the von Neumann graph entropy that achieves provable accuracy, scalability, and interpretability
simultaneously. This approximation is further applied to two entropy-related tasks: network
design and graph similarity measure, where novel graph similarity measure and fast algorithms
are proposed. Our experimental results on graphs of various scales and types show that the very small
entropy gap readily applies to a wide range of graphs and weighted graphs. As an approximation of
the von Neumann graph entropy, the structural information is the only one that achieves both high
efficiency and high accuracy among the prominent methods. It is at least two orders of magnitude
faster than SLaQ with comparable accuracy. Our structural information based methods also exhibit
superior performance in two entropy-related tasks.

The crack tip mechanics of strain gradient plasticity solids is investigated analytically and
numerically. A first-order mechanism-based strain gradient (MSG) plasticity theory based on
Taylor's dislocation model is adopted and implemented in the commercial finite element package
ANSYS by means of a user subroutine. Two boundary value problems are considered, a single edge tension
specimen and a biaxially loaded plate. First, crack tip fields are characterized. Strain gradient
effects associated with dislocation hardening mechanisms elevate crack tip stresses relative
to conventional plasticity. A parametric study is conducted and differences with conventional
plasticity predictions are quantified. Moreover, the asymptotic nature of the crack tip solution
is investigated. The numerical results reveal that the singularity order predicted by the first-order
MSG theory is equal or higher to that of linear elastic solids. Also, the crack tip field appears not
to have a separable solution. Moreover, contrarily to what has been shown in the higher order version
of MSG plasticity, the singularity order exhibits sensitivity to the plastic material properties.
Secondly, analytical and numerical approaches are employed to formulate novel amplitude factors
for strain gradient plasticity. A generalized J-integral is derived and used to characterize a
nonlinear amplitude factor. A closed-form equation for the analytical stress intensity factor
is obtained. Amplitude factors are also derived by decomposing the numerical solution for the crack
tip stress field. Nonlinear amplitude factor solutions are determined across a wide range of values
for the material length scale l and the strain hardening exponent N. The domains of strain gradient
relevance are identified, setting the basis for the application of first-order MSG plasticity
for fracture and damage assessment.

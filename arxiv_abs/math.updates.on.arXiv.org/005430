Internal positivity offers a computationally cheap certificate for external (input-output)
positivity of a linear time-invariant system. However, the drawback with this certificate lies
in its realization dependency. Firstly, computing such a realization requires to find a polyhedral
cone with a potentially high number of extremal generators that lifts the dimension of the state-space
representation, significantly. Secondly, not all externally positive systems posses an internally
positive realization. Thirdly, in many typical applications such as controller design, system
identification and model order reduction, internal positivity is not preserved. To overcome these
drawbacks, we present a tractable sufficient certificate of external positivity based on second-order
cones. This certificate does not require any special state-space realization: if it succeeds with
a possibly non-minimal realization, then it will do so with any minimal realization. While there
exist systems where this certificate is also necessary, we also demonstrate how to construct systems,
where both second-order and polyhedral cones as well as other certificates fail. Nonetheless,
in contrast to other realization independent certificates, the present one appears to be favourable
in terms of applicability and conservatism. Three applications are representatively discussed
to underline its potential. We show how the certificate can be used to find externally positive approximations
of nearly externally positive systems and demonstrated that this may help to reduce system identification
errors. The same algorithm is used then to design state-feedback controllers that provide closed-loop
external positivity, a common approach to avoid over- and undershooting of the step response. Lastly,
we present modifications to generalized balanced truncation such that external positivity is
preserved where our certificate applies.

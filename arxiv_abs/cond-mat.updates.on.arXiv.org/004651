Fermi liquid theory forms the basis for our understanding of the majority of metals, which is manifested
in the description of transport properties that the electrical resistivity goes as temperature
squared in the limit of zero temperature. However, the observations of strange metal states in various
quantum materials, notably high-temperature superconductors, bring this spectacularly successful
theoretical framework into crisis. When electron scattering rate 1/{\tau} hits its limit, kBT/{\hbar}
where {\hbar} is the reduced Planck's constant, T represents absolute temperature and kB denotes
Boltzmann's constant, Planckian dissipation occurs and lends strange metals a surprising link
to black holes, gravity, and quantum information theory. Here, we show the characteristic signature
of strange metallicity arising unprecedentedly in a bosonic system. Our nanopatterned YBa2Cu3O7-{\delta}(YBCO)
film arrays reveal T-linear resistance as well as B-linear magnetoresistance over an extended
temperature and magnetic field range in a quantum critical region in the phase diagram. Moreover,
the slope of the T-linear resistance {\alpha}_cp appears bounded by {\alpha}_cp {\approx} h/2e^2
[1/T]_c^onset where T_c^onset is the temperature at which Cooper pairs form, intimating a common
scale-invariant transport mechanism corresponding to Planckian dissipation.In contrast to
fermionic systems where the temperature and magnetic field dependent scattering rates combine
in quadrature of {\hbar}/{\tau} {\approx} {\sqrt} (((k_B T)^2+({\mu}_B B)^2)), both terms linearly
combine in the present bosonic system, i.e. {\hbar}/{\tau} {\approx} (k_B T+[{\gamma}{\mu}]_B
B), where {\gamma} is a constant. By extending the reach of strange metal phenomenology to a bosonic
system, our results suggest that there is a fundamental principle governing their transport which
transcends particle statistics.

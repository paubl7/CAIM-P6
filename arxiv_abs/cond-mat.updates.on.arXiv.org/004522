Applying deep learning to investigate topological phase transitions (TPTs) becomes a useful method
due to not only its ability to recognize patterns but also its statistical excellency to examine
the amount of information carried by different types of data inputs. Among possible data types,
entanglement-related quantities, such as Majorana correlation matrices (MCMs), one-particle
entanglement spectra (OPES), and entanglement eigenvectors (OPEEs), have been proved effective,
however, are to date mostly restricted to one dimension. Here, we propose practical input data forms
based on those quantities to study TPTs and to compare the efficiency of each form on classic two-dimensional
chiral $p$-wave superconductors via the deep learning approach. First, we find that different
input forms, either matrices or tensors both originated from real MCMs, can affect the precise locations
of the predicted transition points. Next, due to the complex nature of OPEEs, we extract three spatially
dependent quantities from OPEEs, one related to the "intensity", and the other two related to "phases"
of particle and hole components. We show that similar to taking OPES directly as inputs, solely using
"intensity" quantity can only distinguish topological phases from trivial ones, whereas using
either whole MCMs or complete OPEE-extracted quantities can provide sufficient information for
deep learning to distinguish between phases of matter with different $U(1)$ gauges or Chern numbers.
Finally, we discuss certain characteristic features in the deep learning approach and, in particular,
they reveal that our trained models indeed learn physically meaningful features, which confirms
the potential use even at high dimensions.

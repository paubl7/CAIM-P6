The symplectic quantization scheme proposed for matter scalar fields in the companion paper "Symplectic
quantization I" is generalized here to the case of space-time quantum fluctuations. Symplectic
quantization considers an explicit dependence of the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ on an additional
time variable, named "proper time" at variance with the coordinate time of relativity. The physical
meaning of proper time is to label the sequence of $g_{\mu\nu}$ quantum fluctuations at a given point
of the four-dimensional space-time continuum. For this reason symplectic quantization necessarily
incorporates a new degree of freedom, the derivative $\dot{g}_{\mu\nu}$ of the metric field with
respect to proper time, corresponding to the conjugated momentum $\pi_{\mu\nu}$. Symplectic
quantization describes the quantum fluctuations of gravity by means of the symplectic dynamics
generated by a generalized action functional $\mathcal{A}[g_{\mu\nu},\pi_{\mu\nu}] = \mathcal{K}[g_{\mu\nu},\pi_{\mu\nu}]
- S[g_{\mu\nu}]$, playing formally the role of a Hamilton function, where $S[g_{\mu\nu}]$ is the
Einstein-Hilbert action and $\mathcal{K}[g_{\mu\nu},\pi_{\mu\nu}]$ is a new term including
the kinetic degrees of freedom of the field. Such an action allows us to define a pseudo-microcanonical
ensemble for the quantum fluctuations of $g_{\mu\nu}$, built on the conservation of the generalized
action $\mathcal{A}[g_{\mu\nu},\pi_{\mu\nu}]$ rather than of energy. $S[g_{\mu\nu}]$ plays
the role of a potential term along the symplectic action-preserving dynamics: its fluctuations
are the quantum fluctuations of $g_{\mu\nu}$. It is shown how symplectic quantization maps to the
path-integral approach to gravity. By doing so we explain how the integration over the conjugated
momentum field $\pi_{\mu\nu}$ gives rise to a cosmological constant term in the path-integral.

Many of the biological, social and man-made networks around us are inherently dynamic, with their
links switching on and off over time. The evolution of these networks is often non-Markovian, and
the dynamics of their links correlated. Hence, to accurately model these networks, predict their
evolution, and understand how information and other quantities propagate over them, the inclusion
of both memory and dynamical dependencies between links is key. We here introduce a general class
of models of temporal networks based on discrete autoregressive processes. As a case study we concentrate
on a specific model within this class, generating temporal networks with a specified underlying
backbone, and with precise control over the dynamical dependencies between links and the strength
and length of their memories. In this network model the presence of each link is influenced by its
own past activity and the past activities of other links, as specified by a coupling matrix, which
directly controls the causal relations and correlations among links. We propose a method for estimating
the models parameters and how to deal with heterogeneity and time-varying patterns, showing how
the model allows for a more realistic description of real world temporal networks and also to predict
their evolution. We then investigate the role that memory and correlations in link dynamics have
on processes occurring over a temporal network by studying the speed of a spreading process, as measured
by the time it takes for diffusion to reach equilibrium. Through both numerical simulations and
analytical results, we are able to separate the roles of autocorrelations and neighbourhood correlations
in link dynamics, showing that the speed of diffusion is non-monotonically dependent on the memory
length, and that correlations among neighbouring links can speed up the spreading process, while
autocorrelations slow it down.

We report on first principles calculations of spin-transfer torque (STT) in epitaxial magnetic
tunnel junctions (MTJs) based on ferrimagnetic tetragonal Mn$_3$Ga electrodes, both as analyser
in a Fe/MgO stack, and also in an analogous stack with Mn$_3$Ga electrode (instead of Fe) as polariser.
Solving the ballistic transport problem (NEFG+DFT) for the non-equilibrium spin density in a scattering
region extended to over 7.6 nm into the Mn$_3$Ga electrode, we find long-range spatial oscillations
of the STT decaying on a length scale of a few tens of Angstr\"oms, both in the linear response regime
and for finite bias. The oscillatory behavior of the STT in Mn$_3$Ga is robust against variations
in the stack geometry (e.g. the barrier thickness and the interface spacing) and the applied bias
voltage, which may affect the phase and the amplitude of the spacial oscillation, but the high (carrier)
frequency mode is only responsive to variations in the longitudinal lattice constant of Mn$_3$Ga
(for fixed in-plane geometry) without being commensurate with the lattice. Our interpretation
of the long range STT oscillations is based on the bulk electronic structure of Mn$_3$Ga, taking
also into account the spin-filtering properties of the MgO barrier. Comparison to a fully Mn$_3$Ga-based
stack shows similar STT oscillations but a significant enhancement of the TMR effect at the Fermi
level and the STT at the interface due to resonant tunneling. From the calculated energy dependence
of the spin-polarised transmissions at 0 V, we anticipate asymmetric or symmetric TMR as a function
of the applied bias voltage for the Fe-based and the all-Mn$_3$Ga stacks, respectively, which also
both exhibit a sign change below $\pm1$ V. In the latter, symmetric, case we expect a TMR peak at zero,
which is larger for the thinner barriers because of spin-polarised resonant tunneling.

TMDCs have attracted a lot of attention in recent years due to their unique indirect to direct band
gap transition from bulk to monolayer thickness. Strong confinement in the out-of-plane direction
enhances the Coulomb potential between the charged particles (e-h pairs) and thus increases the
exciton binding energy dramatically. The lattice inversion asymmetry in a monolayer creates two
non-equivalent (but degenerate in energy) band edges protected by time reversal polarisation
via pseudo-spin. However, the presence of strong spin-orbit coupling in the valence band and weak
spin-splitting in the conduction band results in the lowest lying exciton in WX2 (X = S, Se) being
spin forbidden and optically dark. Because of their long life times, dark excitons (XD) are highly
attractive for quantum optics and optoelectronic applications. To date studying XD emission is
limited to cryogenic temperature or required very complex experimental configurations to observe
them at room temperature (RT). Here, we demonstrate a novel approach of radiative decay of XD related
emissions in 1L-WSe2 studied by micro and nano PL at RT. 1L-WSe2 flakes were sandwiched by noble metal
(Au or Ag) substrates and PDMS nano-patches providing a strong local out-of-plane dipole moment
with respect to the 2D plane. This strong dipole moment not only enhances the XD in WSe2, it also produces
bound excitons due to extrinsic charge defects visible at RT. The spatial distributions of these
XD related emissions were studied by TEPL with a spatial resolution < 10 nm confirming the confinement
of these excitons within the PDMS nano-patches. Finally, by removing the nano-patches from the
top of the flakes we are able to recover the bright excitons in the 1L-WSe2. Our approach paves the
way for deep understanding and to harness excitonic properties in low dimensional semiconductors,
thus offering a platform towards quantum optics.

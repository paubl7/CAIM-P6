Epitaxial growth on a surface vicinal to a high-symmetry crystallographic plane occurs through
the propagation of atomic steps, a process called step-flow growth. In some instances, the steps
tend to form close groups (or bunches), a phenomenon termed step bunching, which corresponds to
an instability of the equal-spacing step propagation. Over the last fifty years, various mechanisms
have been proposed to explain step bunching, the most prominent of which are the inverse Ehrlich-Schwoebel
effect (i.e., the asymmetry which favors the attachment of adatoms from the upper terrace), elastically
mediated interactions between steps (in heteroepitaxy), step permeability (in electromigration-controlled
growth), and the chemical effect (which couples the diffusion fields on all terraces). Beyond the
discussion of the influence of each of these mechanisms taken independently on the propensity to
bunching, we propose a unified treatment of the effect of these mechanisms on the onset of the bunching
instability, which also accounts for their interplay. This is done in the setting of the so-called
quasistatic approximation, which by permitting mostly analytical treatment, offers a clear view
of the influence on stability of the combined mechanisms. In particular, we find that the Ehrlich-Schwoebel
effect, elastic step-interactions and the chemical effect combine in a quasi-additive fashion,
whereas step permeability is neither stabilizing nor destabilizing per se but changes the relative
influence of the three aforementioned mechanisms. In a companion paper, we demonstrate and discuss
the importance of another mechanism, which we call the dynamics effect, that emerges when relaxing
the simplifying but questionable quasistatic approximation.

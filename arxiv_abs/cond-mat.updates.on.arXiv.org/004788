How liquid transport occurs in confined spaces is relevant to many industrial and lab-scale processes,
ranging from enhanced oil recovery to drug delivery systems. In this work, we investigate propelling
microdroplets that form from liquid-liquid phase separation in a quasi-2D chamber, focusing on
the direction and speed of microdroplets in response to local composition gradients. The confined
ternary solution in our experiments comprises a model oil, a good solvent (ethanol) and a poor solvent
(water). Depending on the initial solution composition, water-rich or oil-rich microdroplets,
form and move spontaneously as the ternary solution mixes with and is displaced by water diffusing
from a deep side channel. Microdroplet movement is followed in situ using high-speed bright-field
imaging or fluorescence imaging when the solution is doped with a dye. Local ethanol composition
gradients are estimated from the variation of fluorescence intensity in the local continuous liquid
surrounding the mobile microdroplets. From phase separation of the ternary solution with high
oil concentration, mobile oil-rich microdroplets form in a water-rich zone, accompanying the
formation of water-rich microdroplets in an oil-rich zone. The fast movement of oil-rich microdroplets
induces directional flow transport that mobilizes water-rich microdroplets close to the water-rich
zone. The average microdroplet speed increases with the initial oil concentration in the ternary
solution. The fastest speed of oil-rich microdroplets observed in our experiments is ~150 ${\mu}$m/s
along the surface of a hydrophobic wall. The presence of a sharp ethanol composition gradient is
the primary driving force for the fast movement of oil-rich microdroplets in confinement. Our results
demonstrate the potential of enhancing liquid transport in confinement through composition gradients
arising from phase separation.

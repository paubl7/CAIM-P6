Recent studies of dynamic properties in complex systems point out the profound impact of hidden
geometry features known as simplicial complexes, which enable geometrically conditioned many-body
interactions. Studies of collective behaviours on the controlled-structure complexes can reveal
the subtle interplay of geometry and dynamics. Here, we investigate the phase synchronisation
dynamics under the competing interactions embedded on 1-simplex (edges) and 2-simplex (triangles)
faces of a homogeneous 4-dimensional simplicial complex. Its underlying network is a 1-hyperbolic
graph with the assortative correlations among the node's degrees and the spectral dimension that
exceeds $d_s=4$. We determine the time-averaged system's order parameter to characterise the
synchronisation level. In the absence of higher interactions, the complete synchrony is continuously
reached with the increasing positive pairwise interactions ($K_1>0$), and a partial synchronisation
for the negative couplings ($K_1<0$) with no apparent hysteresis. Similar behaviour occurs in
the degree-preserved randomised network. In contrast, the synchronisation is absent for the negative
pairwise coupling in the entirely random graph and simple scale-free networks. Increasing the
strength $K_2\neq 0$ of the triangle-based interactions gradually hinders the synchronisation
promoted by pairwise couplings, and the non-symmetric hysteresis loop opens with an abrupt desynchronisation
transition towards the $K_1<0$ branch. However, for substantial triangle-based interactions,
the frustration effects prevail, preventing the complete synchronisation, and the abrupt transition
disappears. These findings shed new light on the mechanisms by which the high-dimensional simplicial
complexes in natural systems, such as human connectomes, can modulate their native synchronisation
processes.

We present the existence of rare d5 off-centering, weak ferroelectric (FE) polarization and demonstrate
its correlation with observed magnetism and magnetoelectric (ME) coupling in the apparent centrosymmetric
(P42/mnm) G type (TN~210K) antiferromagnet(AFM) Fe2TeO6 compound. The origin of ferroelectricity
is associated with both lattice and asymmetric electron density distribution around the ion cores.
Apart from surprising FE of d5 origin, we evidentially report the existence of 3/2 spin state, d(3/2)-d(3/2)
dimeric interaction to manifest broad magnetic transition before TN, and swift change in spin dynamics
at 150K. Simultaneous manifestations of all the correlated phenomena are probed via neutron diffraction,
magnetization, heat capacity, and muon spectroscopic measurements. We also report that the emergence
of magnetic order and the magnetoelectricity solely depends on the same ion (Fe3+) though we observe
unusual ME multiferroicity well above TN. ME coupling is observed in terms of spin-phonon coupling,
magnetic field dependent polarization, ME voltage, and magnetostrain measurements. We propose
the intrabilayer exchange coupling via the double oxygen bridged Fe-O1-Fe pathway plays a dominating
role to exhibit the negative nonlinear ME behavior at 300K. Interbilayer exchange via Fe-O2-Fe
pathways dominantly determines the hysteretic nonlinear ME coupling below TN. We also propose
the spin-phonon coupling to be mediated by asymmetric stretching of Fe-O2 in Fe-O2-Fe exchange
pathways. The observed nonlinear ME coupling signifies the presence of magnetoelasticity as evinced
in the temperature and magnetic field dependent strain measurement. Hence we demonstrate the rare
existence of FE with the possible origin, ME coupling, and FE induced by the same d5 ion in FTO. These
evidences paved a new directions beyond the classical mechanisms described for Type-I and Type-II
multiferroicity.

Quantum materials hosting Weyl fermions have opened a new era of research in condensed matter physics.
First proposed in 1929 in particle physics, Weyl fermions have yet to be observed as elementary particles.
In 2015, Weyl fermions were detected as collective electronic excitations in the strong spin-orbit
coupled material tantalum arsenide, TaAs. This discovery was followed by a flurry of experimental
and theoretical explorations of Weyl phenomena in materials. Weyl materials naturally lend themselves
to the exploration of the topological index associated with Weyl fermions and their divergent Berry
curvature field, as well as the topological bulk-boundary correspondence giving rise to protected
conducting surface states. Here, we review the broader class of Weyl topological phenomena in materials,
starting with the observation of emergent Weyl fermions in the bulk and of Fermi arc states on the
surface of the TaAs family of crystals by photoemission spectroscopy. We then discuss some of the
exotic optical and magnetic responses observed in these materials, as well as the progress in developing
some of the related chiral materials. We discuss the conceptual development of high-fold chiral
fermions, which generalize Weyl fermions, and we review the observation of high-fold chiral fermion
phases by taking the rhodium silicide, RhSi, family of crystals as a prime example. Lastly, we discuss
recent advances in Weyl-line phases in magnetic topological materials. With this Review, we aim
to provide an introduction to the basic concepts underlying Weyl physics in condensed matter, and
to representative materials and their electronic structures and topology as revealed by spectroscopic
studies. We hope this work serves as a guide for future theoretical and experimental explorations
of chiral fermions and related topological quantum systems with potentially enhanced functionalities.

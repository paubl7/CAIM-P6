Using density functional theory and an exchange-correlationfunctional that includes the van
der Waals interaction, we study the coadsorption of CO on Ru(0001) saturated with 0.5 ML of oxygen.
Different coexisting CO coverages are considered that are experimentally motivated, the room
temperaturecoverage consisting of 0.5 ML-O + 0.25 ML-CO (low coverage), the saturation coverage
achieved at low temperatures (0.5 ML-O + 0.375 ML-CO, intermediate coverage), and the equally mixed
monolayer that is stable according to our calculations but not experimentally observed yet (0.5
ML-O + 0.5 ML-CO, high coverage). For each coverage, we study the competition between the desorption
and oxidation of CO on the corresponding optimized structure by analyzing their reaction energies
and minimum energy reaction paths. The desorption process is endothermic at all coverages, although
the desorption energy decreases as the CO coverage increases. The process itself (and also the reverted
adsorption) becomes more involved at the intermediate and high coverages because of the appearance
of a physisorption well and concomitant energy barrier separating it from the chemisorbed state.
Remarkably, the oxidation of CO, which is endothermic at low coverages, turns exothermic at the
intermediate and high coverages. In all cases, the minimum reaction path for oxidation, which involves
the chemisorbed and physisorbed CO2, is ruled by one of the large energy barriers that protect these
molecular states. Altogether, the larger activation energies for oxidation as compared to those
for desorption and the extreme complexity of the oxidation against the desorption paths explain
that CO desorption dominates over the oxidation in experiments.

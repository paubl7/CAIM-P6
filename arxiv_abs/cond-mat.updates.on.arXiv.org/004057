In many studies, atoms deal with the positive or negative charges by losing or gaining their electrons,
but atoms can execute interstate electron dynamics while dealing with a dedicated state. When gaseous
or solid atoms undertake different transition states, electrons can deal with infinitesimal displacements
by remaining within their occupied energy knots. Such possibilities show that atoms cannot ionize,
but the inert gas atoms can split into the electron streams. A generated field of the propagating
photons can distort the flowing inert gas atoms. On splitting inert gas atoms, electrons carry forcing
energy of the chasing photons. Moreover, solid atoms deform or elongate when travelling electrons
impinge on them. Gaseous atoms also undertake squeezing, where the contraction of energy knots
takes place. Such behaviors of the atoms also indicate that they do not ionize. On splitting flowing
inert gas atoms due to the current of photons, the characteristics of propagating photons become
obvious. On propagating the photons in air medium, the element of heat energy dissipates while the
element of force confines, so a glow of light known as plasma appears. The splitting of inert gas atoms
into the electron streams, the carrying of photons by the electrons, and the lighting of travelling
photons infer that electric current is a photonic current. A magnification of image is based on the
resolving power of photons in microscopic analysis. A photonic current is due to the propagation
of featured photons through interstate electron gap or photonic band gap. Some important principles
are also discussed here, which infer the photonic current. Indeed, the study brings about vast changes
in the existing state of science and technology.

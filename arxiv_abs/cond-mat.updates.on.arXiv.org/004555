This review summarizes more than 100 years of research on spinel compounds, mainly focusing on the
progress in understanding their magnetic, electronic, and polar properties during the last two
decades. Many spinel compounds are magnetic insulators or semiconductors; however, a number of
spinel-type metals exists including superconductors and some rare examples of d-derived heavy-fermion
compounds. In the early days, they gained importance as ferrimagnetic or even ferromagnetic insulators
with relatively high saturation magnetization and high ordering temperatures, with magnetite
being the first magnetic mineral known to mankind. However, spinels played an outstanding role
in the development of concepts of magnetism, in testing and verifying the fundamentals of magnetic
exchange, in understanding orbital-ordering and charge-ordering phenomena. In addition, the
A- site as well as the B-site cations in the spinel structure form lattices prone to strong frustration
effects resulting in exotic ground-state properties. In case the A-site cation is Jahn-Teller
active, additional entanglements of spin and orbital degrees of freedom appear, which can give
rise to a spin-orbital liquid or an orbital glass state. The B-site cations form a pyrochlore lattice,
one of the strongest contenders of frustration in three dimensions. In addition, in spinels with
both cation lattices carrying magnetic moments, competing magnetic exchange interactions become
important, yielding ground states like the time-honoured triangular Yafet-Kittel structure.
Finally, yet importantly, there exists a long-standing dispute about the possibility of a polar
ground state in spinels, despite their reported overall cubic symmetry. Indeed, over the years
number of multiferroic spinels were identified.

In highly anisotropic organic superconductor (TMTSF)$_2$ClO$_4$, superconducting (SC) phase
coexists with metallic and spin density wave phases in the form of domains. Using the Maxwell-Garnett
approximation (MGA), we provide a method to calculate the volume ratio and the shape of these embedded
SC domains from resistivity data. Due to percolation of SC domains, the zero resistance can be achieved
even when the SC volume ratio $\phi =\phi_c \ll 1$. This percolation threshold $\phi_c$ depends
on the shape and size of SC domains and of the sample, and may be anisotropic. Using our theory we find
$\phi$ for various cooling rates of (TMTSF)$_{2}$ClO$_{4}$ samples. We also analyze the effect
of disorder on the shape of SC domains. We found that the SC domains have oblate shape, being the shortest
along the interlayer z-axis. This contradicts the widely assumed filamentary superconductivity
along z-axis, used to explain the anisotropic superconductivity onset. We show that this anisotropic
resistivity drop at the SC transition can be described by the analytical MGA theory with anisotropic
background resistance, while the anisotropic $T_c$ can be explained\cite{kochev-AnisotropicZeroresistanceOnset-2020}
by considering a finite size and flat shape of the samples. Due to a flat/needle sample shape, the
probability of percolation via SC domains is the highest along the shortest sample dimension (z-axis),
and the lowest along the sample length (x-axis). Our theory can be applied to other heterogeneous
superconductors, where the size $d$ of SC domains is much larger than the SC coherence length $\xi$,
e.g. cuprates, iron based or organic superconductors. It is also applicable when the spin/charge-density
wave domains are embedded inside a metallic background, or vice versa.

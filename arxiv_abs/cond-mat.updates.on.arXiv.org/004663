We study the chaotic behavior of multidimensional Hamiltonian systems in the presence of nonlinearity
and disorder. It is known that any localized initial excitation in a large enough linear disordered
system spreads for a finite amount of time and then halts forever. This phenomenon is called Anderson
localization (AL). What happens to AL when nonlinearity is introduced is an interesting question
which has been considered in several studies over the past decades. However, the characteristics
and the asymptotic fate of such evolutions still remain an issue of intense debate due to their computational
difficulty, especially in systems of more than one spatial dimension. As the spreading of initially
localized wave packets is a non-equilibrium thermalization process related to the ergodic and
chaotic properties of the system, in our work we investigate the properties of chaos studying the
behavior of observables related to the system's tangent dynamics. In particular, we consider the
disordered discrete nonlinear Schr\"odinger (DDNLS) equation of one (1D) and two (2D) spatial
dimensions. We present detailed computations of the time evolution of the system's maximum Lyapunov
exponent (MLE--$\Lambda$), and the related deviation vector distribution (DVD). We find that
although the systems' MLE decreases in time following a power law $t^{\alpha_\Lambda}$ with $\alpha_\Lambda
<0$ for both the weak and strong chaos regimes, no crossover to the behavior $\Lambda \propto t^{-1}$
(which is indicative of regular motion) is observed. In addition, the analysis of the DVDs reveals
the existence of random fluctuations of chaotic hotspots with increasing amplitudes inside the
excited part of the wave packet, which assist in homogenizing chaos and contribute to the thermalization
of more lattice sites.

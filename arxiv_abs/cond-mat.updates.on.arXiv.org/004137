We study the effects of electron-electron interactions and hole doping on the electronic structure
of Cu-doped NaFeAs using the density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory (DFT+DMFT)
method. In particular, we employ an effective multi-orbital Hubbard model with a realistic bandstructure
of NaFeAs in which Cu-doping was modeled within a rigid band approximation and compute the evolution
of the spectral properties, orbital-dependent electronic mass renormalizations, and magnetic
properties of NaFeAs upon doping with Cu. In addition, we perform fully charge self-consistent
DFT+DMFT calculations for the long-range antiferromagnetically ordered Na(Fe,Cu)As with Cu
$x=0.5$ with a real-space ordering of Fe and Cu ions. Our results reveal a crucial importance of strong
electron-electron correlations and local potential difference between the Cu and Fe ions for understanding
the \textbf{k}-resolved spectra of Na(Fe,Cu)As. Upon Cu-doping, we observe a strong orbital-dependent
localization of the Fe $3d$ states accompanied by a large renormalization of the Fe $xy$ and $xz$/$yz$
orbitals. Na(Fe,Cu)As exhibits bad metal behavior associated with a coherence-to-incoherence
crossover of the Fe $3d$ electronic states and local moments formation near a Mott metal-insulator
transition (MIT). For heavily doped NaFeAs with Cu $x \sim 0.5$ we obtain a Mott insulator with a band
gap of $\sim$0.3 eV characterized by divergence of the quasiparticle effective mass of the Fe $xy$
states. In contrast to this, the quasiparticle weights of the Fe $xz$/$yz$ and $e_g$ states remain
finite at the MIT. The MIT occurs via an orbital-selective Mott phase to appear at Cu $x\simeq0.375$
with the Fe $xy$ states being Mott localized. We propose the possible importance of Fe/Cu disorder
to explain the magnetic properties of Cu-doped NaFeAs.

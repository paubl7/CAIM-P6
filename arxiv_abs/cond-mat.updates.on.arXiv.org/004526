We have explored the multi-component structure of electrical conductivity of relativistic Fermionic
and Bosonic fluid in presence of magnetic field by using Kubo approach. This is done by explicitly
evaluating the thermo-magnetic vector current spectral functions using the real time formalism
of finite temperature field theory and the Schwinger proper time formalism. In absence of magnetic
field, the one-loop diagramatic representation of Kubo expression of any transport coefficients
is exactly same with relaxation time approximation (RTA) based expression, but this equality does
not hold for finite magnetic field picture due to lacking of proper implementation of quantum effect
in latter approach. We have shown this discrepancy for particular transport coefficient - electrical
conductivity, whose starting point in Kubo approach will be electromagnetic current-current
correlator and its one-loop skeleton diagram carrying two scalar/Dirac propagators for scalar/Dirac
fluid. Through a numerical comparison between RTA and Kubo expressions of conductivity components
(parallel and perpendicular), we have attempted to interpret detail quantum field theoretical
effect, contained by Kubo expression but not by RTA expression. In classical RTA expression we get
magnetic field independent parallel conductivity due to zero Lorentz force but in field theoretical
Kubo expression, it decreases and increases with the magnetic field for scalar and Dirac medium
respectively due to Landau quantization effect. This parallel component of conductivity can be
interpreted as zero momentum limit of quantum fluctuation with same Landau level internal lines.
While for perpendicular component of conductivity, fluctuation with Landau level differences
$\pm 1$ are noticed, which might be a new realization of transportation in field theoretical sector.

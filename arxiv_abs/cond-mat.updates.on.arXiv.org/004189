Nominally 45 nm GaN:Mg/ 5 nm (Ga,Mn)N / 45 nm GaN:Mg trilayers structures prepared by molecular beam
epitaxy on GaN-buffered Al2O3 substrates are investigated to verify whether the indirect co-doping
by holes from the cladding layers can alter the spin-spin interaction in (Ga,Mn)N. The four investigated
structures, differing with the Mg doping level, are carefully characterized at the nanoscale by
HRTEM, EDX, and by SIMS. HRTEM decisively excluded a presence of foreign Mn-rich phases. The structures,
up to medium Mg doping, show no Mg over-doping effects. Magnetic studies of these structures are
aided by the employment of a dedicated experimental approach of the in situ compensation of the magnetic
contribution from the substrate, allowing up to about fifty-fold reduction of this contribution.
This technique, dedicated to these structures, simultaneously provides a tenfold reduction of
temporal instabilities of the magnetometric unit and lowers the experimental jitter to merely
$5 \times 10^{-7}$~emu at 70~kOe, vastly increasing the precision and the credibility of the results
of the standard integral SQUID magnetometry in high magnetic fields. The magnetic characteristics
of the trilayers structures established here prove identical with the already known properties
of the thick (Ga,Mn)N single layers, namely (i) the low temperature ferromagnetism among Mn$^{3+}$
ions driven by superexchange and (ii) purely paramagnetic response at higher temperatures. The
possible cause of the lack of any effects brought about by the adjacent Mg-doping is a presence of
residual Mn in the cladding layers, resulting in the deactivation of the p-type doping intended
there. This finding points out that a more intensive technological effort has to be exerted to promote
the co-doping-driven carrier-mediated ferromagnetic coupling in Mn-enriched GaN, especially
at elevated temperatures.

Lithium iron phosphate (LixFePO4), a cathode material used in rechargeable Li-ion batteries,
phase separates upon de/lithiation under equilibrium. The interfacial structure and chemistry
within these cathode materials affects Li-ion transport, and therefore battery performance.
Correlative imaging of LixFePO4 was performed using four-dimensional scanning transmission
electron microscopy (4D-STEM), scanning transmission X-ray microscopy (STXM), and X-ray ptychography
in order to analyze the local structure and chemistry of the same particle set. Over 50,000 diffraction
patterns from 10 particles provided measurements of both structure and chemistry at a nanoscale
spatial resolution (16.6-49.5 nm) over wide (several micron) fields-of-view with statistical
robustness.LixFePO4 particles at varying stages of delithiation were measured to examine the
evolution of structure and chemistry as a function of delithiation. In lithiated and delithiated
particles, local variations were observed in the degree of lithiation even while local lattice
structures remained comparatively constant, and calculation of linear coefficients of chemical
expansion suggest pinning of the lattice structures in these populations. Partially delithiated
particles displayed broadly core-shell-like structures, however, with highly variable behavior
both locally and per individual particle that exhibited distinctive intermediate regions at the
interface between phases, and pockets within the lithiated core that correspond to FePO4 in structure
and chemistry.The results provide insight into the LixFePO4 system, subtleties in the scope and
applicability of Vegards law (linear lattice parameter-composition behavior) under local versus
global measurements, and demonstrate a powerful new combination of experimental and analytical
modalities for bridging the crucial gap between local and statistical characterization.

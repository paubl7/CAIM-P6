Thermoelectric measurements have the potential to uncover the density of states of low-dimensional
materials. Here, we present the anomalous thermoelectric behaviour of mono-layer graphene-nanowire
(NW) heterostructures, showing large oscillations as a function of doping concentration. Our
devices consist of InAs NW and graphene vertical heterostructures, which are electrically isolated
by thin ($\sim$ 10nm) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers. In contrast to conventional thermoelectric
measurements, where a heater is placed on one side of a sample, we use the InAs NW (diameter $\sim 50$
nm) as a local heater placed in the middle of the graphene channel. We measure the thermoelectric
voltage induced in graphene due to Joule heating in the NW as a function of temperature (1.5K - 50K)
and carrier concentration. The thermoelectric voltage in bilayer graphene (BLG)- NW heterostructures
shows sign change around the Dirac point, as predicted by Mott's formula. In contrast, the thermoelectric
voltage measured across monolayer graphene (MLG)-NW heterostructures shows anomalous large-amplitude
oscillations around the Dirac point, not seen in the Mott response derived from the electrical conductivity
measured on the same device. The anomalous oscillations are a signature of the modified density
of states in MLG by the electrostatic potential of the NW, which is much weaker in the NW-BLG devices.
Thermal calculations of the heterostructure stack show that the temperature gradient is dominant
in the graphene region underneath the NW, and thus sensitive to the modified density of states resulting
in anomalous oscillations in the thermoelectric voltage. Furthermore, with the application of
a magnetic field, we detect modifications in the density of states due to the formation of Landau
levels in both MLG and BLG.

The processability and optoelectronic properties of organic semiconductors can be tuned and manipulated
via chemical design. The substitution of the alkyl side chains by oligoethers has recently been
successful for applications such as bioelectronic sensors and photocatalytic water-splitting.
The carbon-oxygen bond in oligoethers is likely to render the system softer and more prone to dynamical
disorder that can be detrimental to charge transport for example. We use neutron spectroscopy,
X-Ray diffraction (XRD), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and polarized optical microscopy
to study the effect of the substitution of n-hexyl (Hex) by triethylene glycol (TEG) on the structural
dynamics of two organic semiconductors: a phenylene-bithiophene-phenylene (PTTP) molecule
and a fluorene-co-dibenzothiophene (FS) polymer. Counterintuitively, inelastic neutron scattering
(INS) reveals a softening of the modes of PTTP and FS with Hex side chains, pointing towards an increased
dynamical disorder in these systems. However, T-dependent X-Ray and neutron diffraction, INS
and DSC evidence an extra reversible transition close to room temperature (RT) for PTTP with TEG
side chains. The observed transition, not accompanied by a change in birefringence, can also be
observed by quasi-elastic neutron scattering. A fastening of the TEG side chains dynamics is observed
in the case of PTTP and not FS. We therefore assign this transition to the melt of the TEG side chains
which are promoting dynamical order at RT, but if crystallising, may introduce an extra reversible
structural transition above RT leading to thermal instabilities. A deeper understanding of side
chain polarity and structural dynamics can help guide materials design and navigate the intricate
balance between electronic charge transport and aqueous swelling, sought for a number of emerging
organic electronic and bioelectronic applications.

Semi-local DFT methods exhibit significant errors for the phase diagrams of transition-metal
oxides that are caused by an incorrect description of molecular oxygen and the large self-interaction
error in materials with strongly localized electronic orbitals. Empirical and semiempirical
corrections based on the DFT+U method can reduce these errors, but the parameterization and validation
of the correction terms remains an on-going challenge. We develop a systematic methodology to determine
the parameters and to statistically assess the results by considering interlinked thermochemical
data across a set of transition metal compounds. We consider three interconnected levels of correction
terms: (1) a constant oxygen binding correction, (2) Hubbard-U correction, and (3) DFT/DFT+U compatibility
correction. The parameterization is expressed as a unified optimization problem. We demonstrate
this approach for 3d transition metal oxides, considering a target set of binary and ternary oxides.
With a total of 37 measured formation enthalpies taken from the literature, the dataset is augmented
by the reaction energies of 1,708 unique reactions that were derived from the formation energies
by systematic enumeration. The parameterization is validated using leave-one-out cross-validation
(CV), a standard technique for the validation of statistical models. We apply the methodology to
the strongly constrained and appropriately normed (SCAN) density functional. Based on the CV score,
the error of binary (ternary) oxide formation energies is reduced by 50% (70%) to 0.08 (0.04) eV/atom.
A simplified correction scheme that does not involve SCAN/SCAN+U compatibility terms still achieves
an error reduction of 35% (50%). The method and tools demonstrated here can be applied to other classes
of materials or to parameterize the corrections to optimize DFT+U performance for other target
physical properties.

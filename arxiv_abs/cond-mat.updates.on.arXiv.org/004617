We study the role of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in the circular photogalvanic (CPG) responses
considering chiral Weyl semimetal (WSM) while a quantized CPG response is guaranteed by broken
of both inversion symmetry (IS) and mirror symmetries. The TRS broken WSM yields one left and one
right chiral Weyl nodes (WNs) while there are two left and right chiral WNs for TRS invariant WSM.
We show that these features can potentially cause the quantization of CPG response at higher values
compared to the topological charge of the underlying WSM. This is further supported by the fact that
Berry curvature and velocity behave differently whether the system preserves or breaks the TRS.
We find the CPG responses for TRS invariant type-II WSM to be quantized at two and four times the topological
charge of the activated WNs while the chemical potential are respectively chosen in the vicinity
of energies associated with left and right chiral WNs. By contrast, irrespective of the above choice
of the chemical potential, the quantization in CPG response is directly given by the topological
charge of the activated WNs for TRS broken case. Interestingly, we notice non-quantized peak in
CPG response when energies of WNs associated with opposite chiralities are close to each other as
it is the case for TRS invariant type-I WSM considered here. Moreover, we show that the tilt can significantly
modify the CPG response as velocity in the tilt direction changes which enters into the CPG tensor
through the Fermi distribution function. Given these exciting outcomes, the second order CPG response
emerges as a useful indicator to characterize the system under consideration. Furthermore, we
investigate the momentum resolved structure of CPG response to relate with the final results and
strengthen our analysis from the perspective of the lattice models.

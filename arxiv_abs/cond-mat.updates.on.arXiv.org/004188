This work, presents a study of lifetime of carriers due to intrinsic scattering mechanisms $viz.$
electron-electron (EEI), electron-phonon (EPI) and phonon-phonon interactions (PPI) in a promising
half-Heusler thermoelectric FeVSb. Using the full-$GW$ method, the effect of EEI and temperature
on the valence and conduction band extrema and band gap are studied. The lifetime of carriers with
temperature are estimated at these band extrema. At 300 K, estimated value of lifetime at VBM (CBM)
is $\sim$1.91 x10$^{-14}s$ ($\sim$2.05 x10$^{-14}s$). The estimated ground state band gap considering
EEI is $\sim$378 meV. Next, the effect of EPI on the lifetime of electrons and phonons with temperature
are discussed. The comparison of two electron lifetimes suggests that EEI should be considered
in transport calculations along with EPI. The average acoustic, optical and overall phonon lifetimes
due to EPI are studied with temperature. Further, the effect of PPI is studied by computing average
phonon lifetime for acoustic and optical phonon branches. The lifetime of the acoustic phonons
are higher compared to optical phonons which indicates acoustic phonons contribute more to lattice
thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{ph}$). The comparison of phonon lifetime due to EPI and PPI suggests
that, above 500 K EPI is the dominant phonon scattering mechanism and cannot be ignored in $\kappa_{ph}$
calculations. Lastly, a prediction of the power factor and figure of merit of n-type and p-type FeVSb
is made by considering the temperature dependent carrier lifetime for the electronic transport
terms. This study shows the importance of considering EEI in electronic transport calculations
and EPI in phonon transport calculations. Our study is expected to provide results to further explore
the thermoelectric transport in this material.

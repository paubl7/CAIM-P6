Recently, some of us developed a novel model glass-forming liquid with k extra interactions with
pseudo neighbours to each liquid particle over and above the regular interactions with its neighbours.
Analysis of the structure and dynamics of these systems showed that with an increase in k the systems
have more mean-field like properties. This work presents an extensive study of the thermodynamics
of the above-mentioned model for several values of k and its correlation with the dynamics. We surprisingly
find that the usual thermodynamic integration (TI) method of calculating the entropy provides
unphysical results for this model. It predicts the vanishing of configurational entropy at state
points at which both the collective and the single-particle dynamics of the system show complete
relaxation. We then employ a new method known as the two-phase thermodynamics (2PT) method to calculate
the entropy. We find that with an increase in k the difference in the entropy computed using the two
methods (2PT and TI) increases. We also find that in the temperature range studied, the entropy calculated
via the 2PT method satisfies the Adam-Gibbs (AG) relationship between the relaxation time and the
configurational entropy, whereas the entropy calculated via the TI method shows a strong violation
of the same. We then apply the 2PT method to calculate the entropy in another system where some fractions
of particles are pinned randomly in their equilibrium positions. This system also shows a similar
breakdown of the AG relationship as reported earlier. We show that the difference in entropy calculated
via the 2PT and TI methods increases with an increase in pinning density. We also find that when the
entropy is calculated using the 2PT method, the AG relationship between the dynamics and the entropy
holds.

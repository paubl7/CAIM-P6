We present the results of an experiment on measuring the gradient of the Casimir force between an
Au-coated hollow glass microsphere and graphene-coated fused silica plate by means of a modified
atomic force microscope cantilever based technique operated in the dynamic regime. These measurements
were performed in high vacuum at room temperature. The energy gap and the concentration of impurities
in the graphene sample used have been measured utilizing scanning tunnelling spectroscopy and
Raman spectroscopy, respectively. The measurement results for the gradients of the Casimir force
are found to be in a very good agreement with theory using the polarization tensor of graphene at nonzero
temperature depending on the energy gap and chemical potential with no fitting parameters. The
theoretical predictions of the same theory at zero temperature are experimentally excluded over
the measurement region from 250 to 517 nm. We have also investigated a dependence of the thermal correction
to the Casimir force gradient on the values of the energy gap, chemical potential, and on the presence
of a substrate supporting the graphene sheet. It is shown that the observed thermal effect is consistent
in size with that arising for pristine graphene sheets if the impact of real conditions such as nonzero
values of the energy gap, chemical potential, and the presence of a substrate is included. Implications
of the obtained results to the resolution of the long-standing problems in Casimir physics are discussed.
In addition to the paper published previously [M. Liu {\it et al}., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 126}, 206802
(2021)], we present measurement results for the energy gap of the graphene sample, double the experimental
data for the Casimir force, and perform a more complete theoretical analysis.

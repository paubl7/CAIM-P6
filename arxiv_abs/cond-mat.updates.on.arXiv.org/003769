Antiferromagnetic spintronic devices have the potential to outperform conventional ferromagnetic
devices due to their ultrafast dynamics and high data density. A challenge in designing these devices
is the control and detection of the orientation of the anti-ferromagnet. One of the most promising
ways to achieve this is through the exchange bias effect. This is of particular importance in large
scale multigranular devices. Due to the large system sizes, previously, only micromagnetic simulations
have been possible, these have an assumed distribution of antiferromagnetic anisotropy directions.
Here, we use an atomistic model where the distribution of antiferromagnetic anisotropy directions
occurs naturally and the exchange bias occurs due to the intrinsic disorder in the antiferromagnet.
We perform large scale simulations, generating realistic values of exchange bias. We find a strong
temperature dependance of the exchange bias, which approaches zero at the blocking temperature
while the coercivity has a peak at the blocking temeprature due to the superparamagnetic flipping
of the antiferromagnet during the hysteresis loop. We find a large discrepancy between the exchange
bias predicted from a geometric model of the antiferromagnetic interface indicating the importance
of grain edge effects in multigranular exchange biased systems. The grain size dependence shows
the expected peak due to a competition between the superparamagnetic nature of small grains and
reduction in the statistical imbalance in the number of interfacial spins for larger grain sizes.
Our simulations confirm the existence of single antiferromagnetic domains within each grain.
The model gives insights into the physical origin of exchange bias and provides a route to developing
optimised nanoscale antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.

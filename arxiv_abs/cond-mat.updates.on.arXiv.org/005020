Magnetic skyrmions, which are topologically distinct magnetic spin textures, are gaining increased
attention for their unique physical properties and potential applications in spintronic devices.
Here we present a design strategy for skyrmion host candidates based on combinations of magnetic
spin, asymmetric building units having stereo-active lone-pair electrons, and polar lattice
symmetry. To demonstrate the viability of the proposed rational design principles, we successfully
synthesized Fe(IO3)3 polycrystalline sample and single crystals by using a new simplified low-temperature
pathway, which is experimentally feasible for extending materials growth of transition metal
iodates. Single crystal X-ray and powder synchrotron X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrated
that Fe(IO3)3 crystallizes in the polar chiral hexagonal lattice with space group P63. The combined
structural features of the macroscopic electric polarization along the c axis stemming from the
coalignment of the stereo-active lone-pairs of the IO3 trigonal pyramid and the magnetic Fe3+cation
residing on the three-fold rotation axis were selected to promote asymmetric exchange coupling.
We find evidence of a predicted skyrmion phase at 14 K to 16 K and 2.5 T to 3.2 T driven by Dzyaloshinskii
Moriya (DM) interaction, a conclusion supported by the appreciable DM exchange and the zero-field
spiral antiferromagnetic ground state of Fe(IO3)3 deduced from neutron diffraction experiments.
The associated magnetic modulation wavelength of the putative skyrmions is expected to be short,
approximately 18 nm, comparable to the period of the DM-driven incommensurate order. This work
links stereo-active lone-pair electron effects to enhanced DM interaction, demonstrating a new
approach for chemical guidelines in the search for skyrmionic states of matter.

Within the framework of the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach we explore the impact of elastic
anisotropy, electrostriction, flexoelectric couplings, and mismatch strain on the domain structure
morphology in ferroelectric core-shell nanoparticles of spherical shape. We perform finite element
modelling (FEM) for multiaxial ferroelectric nanoparticle cores covered with an elastically-isotropic
soft or elastically-anisotropic rigid paraelectric shell, with and without mismatch strains.
In the case of a core covered with a soft shell, the FEM results show that at room temperature a single
polarization vortex with a dipolar kernel can be stable if the electrostriction coupling is weak.
With increasing anisotropic electrostriction coupling, the vortex disappears and is replaced
by complex flux-closure structures, which are formed in the equatorial plane and transform into
an elongated vortex with a central 180-degree domain wall near the core poles. This complex domain
morphology develops in the core due to the anisotropic electrostriction, and the flexoelectric
coupling leads to an additional curvature and twist of the polarization isosurfaces. In contrast
to this, FEM performed for a core covered with a rigid shell shows that, at room temperature, the anisotropic
elastic properties of the shell can stabilize vortex-like structures with three flux-closure
domains, which gradually cross in the equatorial plane of the core and transform into 120-degree
domains near the core poles. The flexoelectric coupling leads to a noticeable curling of the flux-closure
domain walls. A mismatch strain compensates the curling of the flux-closure domains in the core
confined by the elastically-anisotropic rigid shell. Our analysis reveals different types of
topological defects, namely Bloch point structures (BPS) and Ising lines, that form in a ferroelectric
core covered with a soft or rigid shell.

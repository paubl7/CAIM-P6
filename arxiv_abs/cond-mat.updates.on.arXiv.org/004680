Focusing on the implications of recent experiments on Majorana zero modes in semiconductor-superconductor
(SM-SC) heterostructures, we critically examine the quantization of the zero-bias differential
conductance as a possible unambiguous signature of Majorana physics in the presence of disorder.
By numerically calculating the zero-bias conductance (ZBC) maps as function of Zeeman splitting
and chemical potential for different disorder realizations, we show that the presence of quantized
"islands" characterized by a ZBC value (approximately) equal to $2e^2/h$ and having a finite area/volume
in a multi-dimensional parameter space represents a unique signature of Majorana physics supporting
Majorana zero modes (MZMs) or partially-separated Majorana modes (ps-MMs). We find that in the
presence of strong disorder Majorana physics only emerges locally and gives rise to ps-MMs, which,
in turn, generate small quantized islands when one of the Majorana modes is located at the end of the
system. Observing these small islands may require sample selection and the systematic scanning
of a large volume in the control parameter space. Upon decreasing disorder, the quantized islands
increase in size and eventually coalesce into large topological regions. Since the presence of
MZMs localized at the opposite ends of the system is typically associated with large quantized islands,
looking for MZM-induced edge-to-edge correlations is premature in the absence of convincing experimental
evidence for (even small) quantized islands. We conclude that the observation of quantized islands
demonstrates unambiguously the presence of the key ingredients necessary for Majorana physics,
provides an excellent diagnostic tool for evaluating the disorder strength, and, consequently,
represents the next natural milestone in the Majorana search.

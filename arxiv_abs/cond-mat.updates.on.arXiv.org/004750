Recently, the quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators are predicted in Lithium-decorated iron-based
superconductor monolayer materials (LiFeX (X=S, Se and Te)) with very high Curie temperature (\textcolor[rgb]{0.00,0.00,1.00}{PRL
125, 086401 (2020)}), which combines the topological and ferromagnetic (FM) orders. It is interesting
and useful to achieve coexistence of intrinsic piezoelectricity, ferromagnetism and nontrivial
band topology in single two-dimensional (2D) material, namely 2D piezoelectric quantum anomalous
hall insulator (PQAHI). In this work, 2D Janus monolayer $\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$ is predict to
be a room-temperature PQAHI, which possesses dynamic, mechanical and thermal stabilities. It
is predicted to be a half Dirac semimetal without spin-orbit coupling (SOC). It is found that the
inclusion of SOC opens up a large nontrivial gap, which means the nontrivial bulk topology (QAH insulator),
confirmed by the calculation of Berry curvature and the presence of two chiral edge states (Chern
number C=2). Calculated results show that monolayer $\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$ possesses robust
QAH states against biaxial strain and electronic correlations. Compared to LiFeX, the glide mirror
$G_z$ of $\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$ disappears, which will induce only out-of-plane piezoelectric
response. The calculated out-of-plane $d_{31}$ of monolayer $\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$ is -0.238
pm/V comparable with ones of other 2D known materials. Moreover, very high Curie temperature (about
1000 K) is predicted by using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, which means that the QAH effect can be
achieved at room temperature in Janus monolayer $\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$. Similar to monolayer
$\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SSe}$, the PQAHI can also be realized in the Janus monolayer $\mathrm{Li_2Fe_2SeTe}$.

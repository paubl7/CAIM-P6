Nanotechnology is a so-called key-emerging technology that opens a new world of technological
innovation. The novelty of engineered nanomaterials (ENMs) raises concern over their possible
adverse effect to man and the environment. Thereupon, risk assessors are challenged with ever decreasing
times-to-market of nano-enabled products. Combined with the perception that it is impossible
to extensively test all new nanoforms, there is growing awareness that alternative assessment
approaches need to be developed and validated to enable efficient and transparent risk assessment
of ENMs. Associated with this awareness, there is the need to use existing data on similar ENMs as
efficiently as possible, which highlights the need of developing alternative approaches to fate
and hazard assessment like predictive modelling, grouping of ENMs, and read across of data towards
similar ENMs. In this contribution, an overview is given of the current state of the art with regard
to categorization of ENMs and the perspectives for implementation in future risk assessment. It
is concluded that the qualitative approaches to grouping and categorization that have already
been developed are to be substantiated, and additional quantification of the current sets of rules-of-thumb
based approaches is a key priority for the near future. Most of all, the key question of what actually
drives the fate and effects of (complex) particles is yet to be answered in enough detail, with a key
role foreseen for the surface reactivity of particles as modulated by the chemical composition
of the inner and outer core of particles. When it comes to environmental categorization of ENMs we
currently are in a descriptive rather than in a predictive mode.

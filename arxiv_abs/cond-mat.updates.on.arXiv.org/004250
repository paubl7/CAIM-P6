Inter-valence charge transfer (IVCT) is electron transfer between two metal $M$ sites differing
in oxidation states through a bridging ligand: $M^{n+1} + M'^{m} \rightarrow M^{n} + M'^{m+1}$.
It is considered that IVCT is related to the hopping probability of electron (or the electron mobility)
in solids. Since controlling the conductivity of ferromagnetic semiconductors (FMSs) is a key
subject for the development of spintronic device applications, the manipulation of the conductivity
through IVCT may become a new approach of band engineering in FMSs. In Ru-doped cobalt ferrite CoFe$_2$O$_4$
(CFO) that shows ferrimagnetism and semiconducting transport properties, the reduction of the
electric resistivity is attributed to both the carrier doping caused by the Ru substitution for
Co and the increase of the carrier mobility due to hybridization between the wide Ru $4d$ and the Fe
$3d$ orbitals. The latter is the so-called IVCT mechanism that is charge transfer between the mixed
valence Fe$^{2+}$/Fe$^{3+}$ states facilitated by bridging Ru $4d$ orbital: Fe$^{2+}$ + Ru$^{4+}$
$\leftrightarrow$ Fe$^{3+}$ + Ru$^{3+}$. To elucidate the emergence of the IVCT state, we have
conducted x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and resonant photoemission spectroscopy (RPES)
measurements on non-doped CFO and Co$_{0.5}$Ru$_{0.5}$Fe$_2$O$_4$ (CRFO) thin films. The observations
of the XAS and RPES spectra indicate that the presence of the mixed valence Fe$^{2+}$/Fe$^{3+}$
state and the hybridization between the Fe $3d$ and Ru $4d$ states in the valence band. These results
provide experimental evidence for the IVCT state in CRFO, demonstrating a novel mechanism that
controls the electron mobility through hybridization between the $3d$ transition-metal cations
with intervening $4d$ states.

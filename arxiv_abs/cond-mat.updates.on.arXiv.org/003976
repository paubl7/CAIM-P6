We investigate the strain-rate-dependent mechanical behavior and deformation mechanisms of
a refractory high entropy alloy, Ti29Zr24Nb23Hf24 (at.%), with a single-phase body-centered
cubic (BCC) structure. High-temperature compression tests were conducted at temperatures from
700 to 1100{\deg}C at strain rates ranging from 10-3 to 10 s-1. A sudden stress drop after yield point
was observed at higher temperatures and lower strain rates with the Zener-Holloman parameter,
lnZ, in the range of 17.2-20.7. Such a softening behavior can be related to the interaction of dislocations
with short-range clustering. However, at higher strain rates or lower temperatures (lnZ>25.0),
kink bands were activated being responsible for the continuous strengthening of the alloy in competition
with the softening mechanism. Systematic TEM investigations reveal that dislocation walls formed
along {110} planes and dislocation loops were observed at a low strain of 6% at a high strain rate of
1 s-1 and 800{\deg}C. Kink band induced dynamic recrystallization is evident upon further straining.
On the other hand, at low strain rate of 10-3 s-1 and 800{\deg}C, discontinuous recrystallization
mechanisms become dominant with arrays of dislocations forming in front of the bulged boundaries
of parent grains. These sub-grain boundaries eventually turn into high-angle grain boundaries.
We also investigate the deformation mechanism of the alloy under extremely high strain rate (103
s-1) at room temperature. The specimen exhibits extensive kink bands with arrays of dislocation
walls. As further strained, multiple slip systems can be activated and the interaction of dislocation
walls plays a vital role in the strain hardening of the alloy.

Materials where localized magnetic moments are coupled to itinerant electrons, the so-called
Kondo lattice materials, provide a very rich backdrop for strong electron correlations. They are
known to realize many exotic phenomena, including unconventional superconductivity, strange
metals, and correlated topological phases of matter. Here, we report what appears to be electron
fractionalization in insulating Kondo lattice material YbIr$_3$Si$_7$, with emergent neutral
excitations that carry heat but not electric current and contribute to metal-like specific heat.
We show that these neutral particles change their properties as the material undergoes a transformation
between two antiferromagnetic phases in an applied magnetic field. In the low-field AF-I phase,
we find that the low temperature linear specific heat coefficient $\gamma$ and the residual linear
term in the thermal conductivity $\kappa/T(T\rightarrow 0)$ are finite, demonstrating itinerant
gapless excitations. These results, along with a spectacular violation of the Wiedemann-Franz
law, directly indicate that YbIr$_3$Si$_7$ is a charge insulator but a thermal metal. Nuclear magnetic
resonance spectrum reveals a spin-flop transition to a high field AF-II phase. Near the transition
field, $\gamma$ is significantly enhanced. Most surprisingly, inside the AF-II phase, $\kappa/T$
exhibits a sharp drop below $\sim300$ mK, indicating either opening of a tiny gap or a linearly vanishing
density of states. This finding demonstrates a transition from a thermal metal into an insulator/semimetal
driven by the spin-flop magnetic transition. These results suggest that spin degrees of freedom
directly couple to the neutral fermions, whose emergent Fermi surface undergoes a field-driven
instability at low temperatures.

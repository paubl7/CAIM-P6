We investigate the impact of two types of disorder, bond randomness and site dilution, on the spin
dynamics in the Kitaev model on a honeycomb lattice. The ground state of this model is a canonical
quantum spin liquid with spin fractionalization into two types of quasiparticles, itinerant Majorana
fermions and localized fluxes. Using unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we calculate the
temperature evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor, the magnetic susceptibility, and
the NMR relaxation rate. In the dynamical spin structure factor, we find that the two types of disorder
affect seriously the low-energy peak dominantly originating from the flux excitations, rather
than the high-energy continuum from the Majorana excitations, in a different way: The bond randomness
softens the peak to the lower energy with broadening, whereas the site dilution smears the peak and
in addition develops the other sharp peaks inside the spin gap including the zero energy. We show
that the zero-energy spin excitations, which originate from the Majorana zero modes induced around
the site vacancies, survive up to the temperature comparable to the energy scale of the Kitaev interaction.
For the bond randomness, the low-temperature susceptibility does not show any qualitative change
against the weak disorder, but it changes to divergent behavior while increasing the strength of
disorder. Similar distinct behaviors for the weak and strong disorder are observed also in the NMR
relaxation rate; an exponential decay changes into a power-law decay. In contrast, for the site
dilution, we find no such crossover; divergent behavior in the susceptibility and a power-law decay
in the NMR relaxation rate appear immediately with the introduction of the site dilution. We discuss
the relevance of our results to experiments for the Kitaev candidate materials with disorders.

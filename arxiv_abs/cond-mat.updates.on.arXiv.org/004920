As an important subject in non-equilibrium Statistical Mechanics, we study in this thesis the relaxation
to equilibrium of a photon gas in contact with an non-relativistic and non-degenerate electron
bath. Photons and electrons interact via the Compton effect, establishing thermal equilibrium
of radiation with matter as pointed out by A.S. Kompaneets in 1957. The evolution of the photon distribution
function is then described by the eponymous partial differential equation, here viewed as the diffusion
approximation to the relativistic Boltzmann equation that describes the system. Being one of the
few examples where this diffusion approximation can be performed in great detail, yielding the
Bose-Einstein distribution as stationary solution, the Kompaneets equation also provides the
description of the so-called Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect, which is the change of apparent brightness
of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) radiation. There are many ways of deriving this equation,
but one of them, which was proposed by Kompaneets in 1957 stands out for its directness and simplicity.
However, we point out in this work that there are some inconsistencies regarding this traditional
derivation that were repeated by all the references we could find that follow the original framework
of 1957. This thesis is divided in two parts: in the first we will be interested in how to deal with these
inconsistencies, building the necessary basis in which the diffusion approximation to the Boltzmann
equation is consistently performed. In the second part, we will be interested in possible extensions
and beyond reviewing some existing extensions, we will also show that a new setup involving a master
equation of a random walk with suitable chosen transition rates in the photon reciprocal space furnishes
not only Kompaneets equation but also a first generalization to a system of bosons under a possible
driving.

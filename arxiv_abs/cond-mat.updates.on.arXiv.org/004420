The ability of cells to move through small spaces depends on the mechanical properties of the cellular
cytoskeleton and on nuclear deformability. In mammalian cells, the cytoskeleton is comprised
of three interacting, semi-flexible polymer networks: actin, microtubules, and intermediate
filaments (IF). Recent experiments of mouse embryonic fibroblasts with and without vimentin have
shown that the IF vimentin plays a role in confined cell motility. We, therefore, develop a minimal
model of cells moving through confined geometries that effectively includes all three types of
cytoskeletal filaments with a cell consisting of an actomyosin cortex and a deformable cell nucleus
and mechanical connections between the two cortices the outer actomyosin one and the inner nuclear
one. By decreasing the amount of vimentin, we find that the cell speed is typically faster for vimentin-null
cells as compared to cells with vimentin. Vimentin-null cells also contain more deformed nuclei
in confinement. Finally, vimentin affects nucleus positioning within the cell. By positing that
as the nucleus position deviates further from the center of mass of the cell, microtubules become
more oriented in a particular direction to enhance cell persistence or polarity, we show that vimentin-nulls
are more persistent than vimentin-full cells. The enhanced persistence indicates that the vimentin-null
cells are more subjugated by the confinement since their internal polarization mechanism that
depends on cross-talk of the centrosome with the nucleus and other cytoskeletal connections is
diminished. In other words, the vimentin-null cells rely more heavily on external cues. Our modeling
results present a quantitative interpretation for recent experiments and have implications for
understanding the role of vimentin in the epithelial-mesenchymal transition.

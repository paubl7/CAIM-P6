This work applies concepts of artificial neural networks to identify the parameters of a mathematical
model based on phase fields for damage and fracture. Damage mechanics is the part of the continuum
mechanics that models the effects of the micro-defect formation using state variables at the macroscopic
level. The equations that define the model are derived from fundamental laws of physics and provide
important relationships between state variables. Simulations using the model considered in this
work produce good qualitative and quantitative results, but many parameters must be adjusted to
reproduce a certain material behavior. The identification of model parameters is considered by
solving an inverse problem that uses pseudo-experimental data to find the values that produce the
best fit to the data. We apply a physics-informed neural network and combine some classical estimation
methods to identify the material parameters that appear in the damage equation of the model. Our
strategy consists of a neural network that acts as an approximating function of the damage evolution
with its output regularized using the residue of the differential equation. Three stages of optimization
seek the best possible values for the neural network and the material parameters. The training alternates
between the fitting of only the pseudo-experimental data or the total loss that includes the regularizing
terms. We test the robustness of the method to noisy data and its generalization capabilities using
a simple physical case for the damage model. This procedure deals better with noisy data in comparison
with a PDE-constrained optimization method, and it also provides good approximations of the material
parameters and the evolution of damage.

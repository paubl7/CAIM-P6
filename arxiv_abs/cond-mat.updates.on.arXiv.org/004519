The intertwined ferroelectricity and photovoltaics in two-dimensional (2D) materials will enable
the favorable improvement and control of photovoltaic preformances. In this paper, we take 2D 3R
bilayer BX (X=P, As, Sb) as model systems to study the photovoltaic characteristics of intrinsic
2D out-of-plane (OOP) ferroelectric material, and try to explore a strategy to regulate the photoelectric
properties by changing the strength of ferroelectric polarization. Due to the spatial inversion
symmetry broken caused by special 3R stacking, spontaneous OOP ferroelectric polarization will
appear in the 3R bilayer BX, which can be swichable through a specific interlayer sliding. The OOP
ferroelectricity leads to charge transfer between layers, realizes efficient spatial separation
between holes and electrons, and forms the characteristics of type-II band alignment. Moreover,
due to perfect lattice match on account of two identical layers, the 3R bilayer BX is more stable and
easy to realize in experiments than most of traditional 2D heterostructures made up of different
materials. The 3R bilayer BX shows moderate band gap, ultra-high carrier mobility and efficient
optical absorption, and its nano-devices present large photocurrent, high photon responsivity
and excellent external quantum efficiency. More importantly, all these photoelectric parameters
depend on the intrinsic OOP ferroelectric strength. By changing the interlayer distance of bilayer
BX, the ferroelectric polarization can be regulated effectively to achieve the optimal photoelectric
performance. Finally, we emphasize the importance and universality of spatial inversion symmetry
broken in layered materials beyond the 3R bilayer BX to realize the co-regulation of ferroelectric
and photovoltaics.

During the strip rolling process, a considerable amount of the forces of the material pressure cause
elastic deformation on the work-roll, i.e., the deflection process. The uncontrollable amount
of the work-roll deflection leads to the high deviations in the permissible thickness of the plate
along its width. In the context of the Austenitic Stainless Steels (ASS), due to the instability
of the Austenite phase in a cold temperature, cold deformation leads to the production of Strain-Induced
Martensite (SIM), which improves the mechanical properties. It leads to the hardening of the ASS
316L during the cold deformation, which causes the Strain-Stress curve of the ASS 316L to behave
non-linearly, which distinguishes it from other categories of steels. To account for this phenomenon,
we propose to utilize a Machine Learning (ML) method to predict more accurately the flow stress of
the ASS 316L during the cold rolling. Furthermore, we conduct various mechanical tensile tests
in order to obtain the required dataset, Stress316L, for training the neural network. Moreover,
instead of using a constant value of flow stress during the multi-pass rolling process, we use a Finite
Difference (FD) formulation of the equilibrium equation in order to account for the dynamic behavior
of the flow stress, which leads to the estimation of the mean pressure, which the strip enforces to
the rolls during deformation. Finally, using the Finite Element Analysis (FEA), the deflection
of the work-roll tools will be calculated. As a result, we end up with a generalized model for the calculation
of the roll deflection, specific to the ASS 316L. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first model
for ASS 316L which considers dynamic flow stress and SIM of the rolled plate, using FEM and an ML approach,
which could contribute to the better design of the tolls.

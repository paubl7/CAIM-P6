This paper uses both experimental and numerical approaches to revisit the concept of current transfer
length (CTL) in second-generation high-temperature superconductor coated conductors with a
current flow diverter (CFD) architecture. The CFD architecture has been implemented on eight commercial
coated conductors samples from THEVA. In order to measure the 2-D current distribution in the silver
stabilizer layer of the samples, we first used a custom-made array of 120 voltage taps to measure
the surface potential distribution. Then, the so-called "static" CTL ($\lambda_s$) was extracted
using a semi-analytical model that fitted well the experimental data. As defined in this paper,
the static CTL on a 2-D domain is a generalization of the definition commonly used in literature.
In addition, we used a 3-D finite element model to simulate the normal zone propagation in our CFD
samples, in order to quantify their "dynamic" CTL ($\lambda_d$), a new concept introduced in this
paper and defined as the CTL observed during the propagation of a quenched region. The results show
that, for a CFD architecture, $\lambda_d$ is always larger than $\lambda_s$, whereas $\lambda_d
= \lambda_s$ when the interfacial resistance between the stabilizer and the superconductor layers
is the same everywhere. We proved that the cause of these different behaviors is related to the shape
of the normal zone, which is curved for the CFD architecture, and rectangular otherwise. Finally,
we showed that the NZPV is proportional to $\lambda_d$, not with $\lambda_s$, which suggests that
the dynamic CTL $\lambda_d$ is the most general definition of the CTL and should always be used when
current crowding and non-uniform heat generation occurs around a normal zone.

We study the quantum statistical electronic properties of random networks which inherently lack
a fixed spatial dimension. We use tools like the density of states (DOS) and the inverse participation
ratio(IPR) to uncover various phenomena, such as unconventional properties of the energy spectrum
and persistent localized states(PLS) at various energies, corresponding to quantum phases with
with zero-dimensional(0D) and one-dimensional(1D) order. For small ratio of edges over vertices
in the network $RT$ we find properties resembling graphene/honeycomb lattices, like a similar
DOS containing a linear dispersion relation at the band center at energy E=0. In addition we find
PLS at various energies including E=-1,0,1 and others, for example related to the golden ratio.
At E=0 the PLS lie at disconnected vertices, due to partial bipartite symmetries of the random networks
(0D order). At E=-1,1 the PLS lie mostly at pairs of vertices(bonds), while the rest of the PLS at other
energies, like the ones related to the golden ratio, lie at lines of vertices of fixed length(1D order),
at the spatial boundary of the network, resembling the edge states in confined graphene systems
with zig-zag edges. As the ratio $RT$ is increased the DOS of the network approaches the Wigner semi-circle,
corresponding to random symmetric matrices(Hamiltonians) and the PLS are reduced and gradually
disappear as the connectivity in the network increases. Finally we calculate the spatial dimension
$D$ of the network and its fluctuations, obtaining both integer and non-integer values and examine
its relation to the electronic properties derived. Our results imply that universal physics can
manifest in physical systems irrespectively of their spatial dimension. Relations to emergent
spacetime in quantum and emergent gravity approaches are also discussed.

The study of topological band structures has recently been extended from electrons to many other
systems with band-like excitations. One promising avenue is the triplet excitations of quantum
paramagnets, which can realize a variety of topologically-nontrivial band structures. Recently,
triplet bands characterized by a Z2 topological invariant, analogous to that introduced by Kane
and Mele, have been discussed in a quantum paramagnet realized on a bilayer honeycomb lattice [D.
G. Joshi and A. P. Schnyder, Phys. Rev. B 100, 020407 (2019)]. In this case, triplet bands form time-reversal
(TR) partners, which play the role of the Kramers pairs of electrons in the Kane-Mele model. However,
Bosonic triplet excitations do not enjoy the same symmetry-protection as Kramers pairs of electrons
and can be mixed by interactions. The consequences of such mixing for the Z2 topological phases of
a quantum paramagnet remain an open question. In this paper, we explore this problem on the bilayer
kagome lattice. We show that, as long as a TRxU(1) symmetry is preserved, the triplet excitations
provide a faithful analog of the Kane-Mele model. Kagome bands realize both a quadratic and a linear
band touching, and we provide a thorough characterization of the Berry curvature associated with
both cases. We also construct the most general TR invariant triplet Hamiltonian allowed by the symmetry.
We find that exchange interactions with quadrupolar character, typical in realistic models, lift
the required U(1) symmetry and destroy the Z2 band topology. We further consider the effects of TR
breaking by an applied magnetic field. In this case, the lifting of spin-degeneracy leads to the
formation of a triplet Chern insulator, which is stable against the breaking of U(1) symmetry. We
calculate the triplet-mediated spin Nernst and thermal Hall signals, making predictions, which
could be compared with experiments.

The simulation of transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images or diffraction patterns is often
required to interpret their contrast and extract specimen features. This is especially true for
high-resolution phase-contrast imaging of materials, but electron scattering simulations based
on atomistic models are widely used in materials science and structural biology. Since electron
scattering is dominated by the nuclear cores, the scattering potential is typically described
by the widely applied independent atom model. This approximation is fast and fairly accurate, especially
for scanning TEM (STEM) annular dark-field contrast, but it completely neglects valence bonding
and its effect on the transmitting electrons. However, an emerging trend in electron microscopy
is to use new instrumentation and methods to extract the maximum amount of information from each
electron. This is evident in the increasing popularity of techniques such as 4D-STEM combined with
ptychography in materials science, and cryogenic microcrystal electron diffraction in structural
biology, where subtle differences in the scattering potential may be both measurable and contain
additional insights. Thus, there is increasing interest in electron scattering simulations based
on electrostatic potentials obtained from first principles, mainly via density functional theory,
which was previously mainly required for holography. In this Review, we discuss the motivation
and basis for these developments, survey the pioneering work that has been published thus far, and
give our outlook for the future. We argue that a physically better justified \textit{ab initio}
description of the scattering potential is both useful and viable for an increasing number of systems,
and we expect such simulations to steadily gain in popularity and importance.

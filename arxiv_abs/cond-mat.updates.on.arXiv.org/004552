We introduce the Voronoi fundamental zone octonion interpolation framework for grain boundary
(GB) structure-property models and surrogates. The VFZO framework offers an advantage over other
five degree-of-freedom based property interpolation methods because it is constructed as a point
set in a manifold. This means that directly computed Euclidean distances approximate the original
octonion distance with significantly reduced computation runtime (~7 CPU minutes vs. 153 CPU days
for a 50000x50000 pairwise-distance matrix). This increased efficiency facilitates lower interpolation
error through the use of significantly more input data. We demonstrate grain boundary energy interpolation
results for a non-smooth validation function and simulated bi-crystal datasets for Fe and Ni using
four interpolation methods: barycentric interpolation, Gaussian process regression (GPR),
inverse-distance weighting, and nearest-neighbor interpolation. These are evaluated for 50000
random input GBs and 10 000 random prediction GBs. The best performance was achieved with GPR, which
resulted in a reduction of the root mean square error (RMSE) by 83.0% relative to RMSE of a constant,
average model. Likewise, interpolation on a large, noisy, molecular statics Fe simulation dataset
improves performance by 34.4% compared to 21.2% in prior work. Interpolation on a small, low-noise
MS Ni simulation dataset is similar to interpolation results for the original octonion metric (57.6%
vs. 56.4%). A vectorized, parallelized, MATLAB interpolation function (interp5DOF.m) and related
routines are available in our VFZO repository (github.com/sgbaird-5dof/interp) which can be
applied to other crystallographic point groups. The VFZO framework offers advantages for computing
distances between GBs, estimating property values for arbitrary GBs, and modeling surrogates
of computationally expensive 5DOF functions and simulations.

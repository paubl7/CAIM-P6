We develop a quantum-inspired numerical procedure for searching low-energy states of a classical
Hamiltonian composed of two-body fully-connected random Ising interactions and a random local
longitudinal magnetic field. In this method, we introduce infinitesimal quantum interactions
that do not commute with the original Ising Hamiltonian, and repeatedly generate and truncate direct
product states, inspired by the Krylov subspace method, to obtain the low-energy states of the original
classical Ising Hamiltonian. The computational cost is controlled by the form of infinitesimal
quantum interactions (e.g., one-body or two-body interactions) and the numbers of infinitesimal
interaction terms introduced, different initial states considered, and low-energy states kept
during the iteration. For a demonstrate of the method, here we introduce as the infinitesimal quantum
interactions pair products of Pauli $X$ operators acting on different sites and on-site Pauli $X$
operators into the random Ising Hamiltonian, in which the numerical cost is $O(N^3)$ per iteration
with the system size $N$. We consider 120 instances of the random coupling realizations for the random
Ising Hamiltonian with $N$ up to 600 and search the 120 lowest-energy states for each instance. We
find that the time-to-solution by the quantum-inspired method proposed here, with parallelization
in terms of the different initial states, for searching the ground state of the random Ising Hamiltonian
scales approximately as $N^5$ for $N$ up to 600. We also examine the basic physical properties such
as the ensemble-averaged ground-state and first-excited energies and the ensemble-averaged
number of states in the low-energy region of the random Ising Hamiltonian.

Flat electronic bands, characteristic of magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), host a wealth
of correlated phenomena. Early theoretical considerations suggested that, at the magic angle,
the Dirac velocity vanishes and the entire width of the moir\'e bands becomes extremely narrow.
Yet, this scenario contradicts experimental studies that reveal a finite Dirac velocity as well
as bandwidths significantly larger than predicted. Here we use spatially resolved spectroscopy
in finite and zero magnetic fields to examine the electronic structure of moir\'e bands and their
intricate connection to correlated phases. By following the relative shifts of Landau levels in
finite fields, we detect filling-dependent band flattening, that unexpectedly starts already
at ~1.3 degrees, well above the magic angle and hence nominally in the weakly correlated regime.
We further show that, as the twist angle is reduced, the moir\'e bands become maximally flat at progressively
lower doping levels. Surprisingly, when the twist angles reach values for which the maximal flattening
occurs at approximate filling of $-2$, $+1$,$+2$,$+3$ electrons per moir\'e unit cell, the corresponding
zero-field correlated phases start to emerge. Our observations are corroborated by calculations
that incorporate an interplay between the Coulomb charging energy and exchange interactions;
together these effects produce band flattening and hence a significant density-of-states enhancement
that facilitates the observed symmetry-breaking cascade transitions. Besides emerging phases
pinned to integer fillings, we also experimentally identify a series of pronounced correlation-driven
band deformations and soft gaps in a wider doping range around $\pm 2$ filling where superconductivity
is expected. Our results highlight the role of interaction-driven band-flattening in forming
robust correlated phases in TBG.

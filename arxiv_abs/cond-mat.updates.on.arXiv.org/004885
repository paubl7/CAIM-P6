The Hall effect, in which current flows perpendicular to an applied electrical bias, has played
a prominent role in modern condensed matter physics over much of the subject's history. Appearing
variously in classical, relativistic and quantum guises, it has among other roles contributed
to establishing the band theory of solids, to research on new phases of strongly interacting electrons,
and to the phenomenology of topological condensed matter. The dissipationless Hall current requires
time-reversal symmetry breaking. For over a century it has either been ascribed to externally applied
magnetic field and referred to as the ordinary Hall effect, or ascribed to spontaneous non-zero
total internal magnetization (ferromagnetism) and referred to as the anomalous Hall effect. It
has not commonly been associated with antiferromagnetic order. More recently, however, theoretical
predictions and experimental observations have identified large Hall effects in some compensated
magnetic crystals, governed by neither of the global magnetic-dipole symmetry breaking mechanisms
mentioned above. The goals of this article are to systematically organize the present understanding
of anomalous antiferromagnetic materials that generate a non-zero Hall effect, which we will call
anomalous Hall antiferromagnets, and to discuss this class of materials in a broader fundamental
and applied research context. Our motivation in drawing attention to anomalous Hall antiferromagnets
is two-fold. First, since Hall effects that are not governed by magnetic dipole symmetry breaking
are at odds with the traditional understanding of the phenomenon, the topic deserves attention
on its own. Second, this new reincarnation has again placed the Hall effect in the middle of an emerging
field of physics at the intersection of multipole magnetism, topological condensed matter, and
spintronics.

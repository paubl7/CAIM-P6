Defect dynamics in materials are of central importance to a broad range of technologies from catalysis
to energy storage systems to microelectronics. Material functionality depends strongly on the
nature and organization of defects, their arrangements often involve intermediate or transient
states that present a high barrier for transformation. The lack of knowledge of these intermediate
states and the presence of this energy barrier presents a serious challenge for inverse defect design,
especially for gradient-based approaches. Here, we present a reinforcement learning (Monte Carlo
Tree Search) based on delayed rewards that allow for efficient search of the defect configurational
space and allows us to identify optimal defect arrangements in low dimensional materials. Using
a representative case of 2D MoS2, we demonstrate that the use of delayed rewards allows us to efficiently
sample the defect configurational space and overcome the energy barrier for a wide range of defect
concentrations (from 1.5% to 8% S vacancies), the system evolves from an initial randomly distributed
S vacancies to one with extended S line defects consistent with previous experimental studies.
Detailed analysis in the feature space allows us to identify the optimal pathways for this defect
transformation and arrangement. Comparison with other global optimization schemes like genetic
algorithms suggests that the MCTS with delayed rewards takes fewer evaluations and arrives at a
better quality of the solution. The implications of the various sampled defect configurations
on the 2H to 1T phase transitions in MoS2 are discussed. Overall, we introduce a Reinforcement Learning
(RL) strategy employing delayed rewards that can accelerate the inverse design of defects in materials
for achieving targeted functionality.

A central line of inquiry in condensed matter science has been to understand how the competition
between different states of matter give rise to emergent physical properties. Perhaps some of the
most studied systems in this respect are the hole-doped LaMnO$_3$ perovskites, with interest in
the past three decades being stimulated on account of their colossal magnetoresistance (CMR).
However, phase segregation between ferromagnetic (FM) metallic and antiferromagnetic (AFM)
insulating states, which itself is believed to be responsible for the colossal change in resistance
under applied magnetic field, has until now prevented a full atomistic level understanding of the
orbital ordered (OO) state at the optimally doped level. Here, through the detailed crystallographic
analysis of the hole-doped phase diagram of a prototype system, we show that the superposition of
two distinct lattice modes gives rise to a striped structure of OO Jahn-Teller active Mn$^{3+}$
and charge disordered (CD) Mn$^{3.5+}$ layers in a 1:3 ratio. This superposition leads to an exact
cancellation of the Jahn-Teller-like oxygen atom displacements in the CD layers only at the 3/8th
doping level, coincident with the maximum CMR response of the manganties. Furthermore, the periodic
striping of layers containing Mn$^{3.5+}$, separated by layers of fully ordered Mn$^{3+}$, provides
a natural mechanism though which long range OO can melt, a prerequisite for the emergence of the FM
conducting state. The competition between insulating and conducting states is seen to be a key feature
in understanding the properties in highly correlated electron systems, many of which, such as the
CMR and high temperature superconductivity, only emerge at or near specific doping values.

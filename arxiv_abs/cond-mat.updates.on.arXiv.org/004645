The von Neumann entropy of a quantum state is a central concept in physics and information theory,
having a number of compelling physical interpretations. There is a certain perspective that the
most fundamental notion in quantum mechanics is that of a quantum channel, as quantum states, unitary
evolutions, measurements, and discarding of quantum systems can each be regarded as certain kinds
of quantum channels. Thus, an important goal is to define a consistent and meaningful notion of the
entropy of a quantum channel. Motivated by the fact that the entropy of a state $\rho$ can be formulated
as the difference of the number of physical qubits and the "relative entropy distance" between $\rho$
and the maximally mixed state, here we define the entropy of a channel $\mathcal{N}$ as the difference
of the number of physical qubits of the channel output with the "relative entropy distance" between
$\mathcal{N}$ and the completely depolarizing channel. We prove that this definition satisfies
all of the axioms, recently put forward in [Gour, IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 65, 5880 (2019)], required
for a channel entropy function. The task of quantum channel merging, in which the goal is for the receiver
to merge his share of the channel with the environment's share, gives a compelling operational interpretation
of the entropy of a channel. The entropy of a channel can be negative for certain channels, but this
negativity has an operational interpretation in terms of the channel merging protocol. We define
Renyi and min-entropies of a channel and prove that they satisfy the axioms required for a channel
entropy function. Among other results, we also prove that a smoothed version of the min-entropy
of a channel satisfies the asymptotic equipartition property.

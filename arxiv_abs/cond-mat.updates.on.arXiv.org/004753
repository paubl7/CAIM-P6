Layered transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) host a plethora of interesting physical phenomena
ranging from charge order to superconductivity. By introducing magnetic ions into 2H-NbS$_2$,
the material forms a family of magnetic intercalated TMDCs T$_x$NbS$_2$ (T = 3d transition metal).
Recently, Fe$_{1/3+\delta}$NbS$_2$ has been found to possess intriguing resistance switching
and magnetic memory effects coupled to the N\'{e}el temperature of T$_N \sim 45$ K [1,2]. We present
comprehensive single crystal neutron diffraction measurements on under-intercalated ($\delta
\sim -0.01$), stoichiometric, and over-intercalated ($\delta \sim 0.01$) samples. Magnetic
defects are usually considered to suppress magnetic correlations and, concomitantly, transition
temperatures. Instead, we observe highly tunable magnetic long-ranged states as the Fe concentration
is varied from under-intercalated to over-intercalated, that is from Fe vacancies to Fe interstitials.
The under- and over- intercalated samples reveal distinct antiferromagnetic stripe and zig-zag
orders, associated with wave vectors $k_1$ = (0.5, 0, 0) and $k_2$ = (0.25, 0.5, 0), respectively.
The stoichiometric sample shows two successive magnetic phase transitions for these two wave vectors
with an unusual rise-and-fall feature in the intensities connected to $k_1$. We ascribe this sensitive
tunability to the competing next nearest neighbor exchange interactions and the oscillatory nature
of the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) mechanism. We discuss experimental observations
that relate to the observed intriguing switching resistance behaviors. Our discovery of a magnetic
defect tuning of the magnetic structure in bulk crystals Fe$_{1/3+\delta}$NbS$_2$ provides a
possible new avenue to implement controllable antiferromagnetic spintronic devices.

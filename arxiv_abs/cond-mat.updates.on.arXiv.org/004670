Tetragonal Mo5PB2 compound, a recently discovered superconductor, belongs to technologically
important class of materials. It is quite surprising to note that a large number of physical properties
of Mo5PB2, including elastic properties and their anisotropy, acoustic behavior, electronic
(charge density distribution, electron density difference), thermo-physical, bonding characteristics,
and optical properties have not been carried out at all. In the present work we have explored all these
properties in details for the first time with density functional theory based first-principles
method. Mo5PB2 is found to be a mechanically stable, elastically anisotropic compound with ductile
character. Moreover, the chemical bonding is interpreted by calculating the electronic energy
density of states, electron density distribution, elastic properties and Mulliken bond population
analysis. Mo5PB2 has a combination of mainly ionic, metallic, and some covalent bonding characteristics.
The compound possesses high level of machinability. The band structure along with a large electronic
density of states at the Fermi level reveals metallic character. Calculated values of different
thermal parameters of Mo5PB2 are closely related to the elastic properties. The energy dependent
optical parameters show close assent to the underlying electronic band structure. The optical
absorption and reflectivity spectra and the low energy index of refraction of Mo5PB2 show that the
compound holds promise to be used in optoelectronic device sector. Unlike the notable anisotropy
found in elastic, mechanical properties and minimum thermal conductivity, the optical parameters
are found to be almost isotropic with respect to the polarization direction of the incident electric
field.

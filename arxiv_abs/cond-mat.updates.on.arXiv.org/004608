Hard-sphere model systems are well-suited in both experiment and simulations to investigate fundamental
aspects of the crystallization of fluids. In experiments on colloidal models of hard-sphere fluids,
the uid is unavoidably at contact with the walls of the sample cell, where heterogeneous crystallization
may take place. In this work we use simulations to investigate the competition between homogeneous
and heterogeneous crystallization. We report simulations of wall-induced nucleation for different
confining walls. Combining the results of these simulations with earlier studies of homogeneous
allows us to asses the competition between homogeneous and heterogeneous nucleation as a function
of wall type, fluid density and the system size. On at walls, heterogeneous nucleation will typically
overwhelm homogeneous nucleation. However, even for surfaces randomly coated with spheres with
a diameter that was some three times larger than that of the fluid spheres - as has been used in some
experiments - heterogeneous nucleation is likely to be dominant for volume fractions smaller than
0.535. Only for a disordered coating that has the same structure as the liquid holds promise did we
find the nucleation was likely to occur in the bulk. Hence, such coatings might be used to suppress
heterogeneous nucleation in experiments. Finally, we report the apparent homogeneous nucleation
rate taking into account the formation of crystallites both in the bulk and at the walls. We find that
the apparent overall nucleation rates coincides with those reported in "homogeneous nucleation"
experiments. This suggests that heterogeneous nucleation at the walls could partly explain the
large discrepancies found between experimental measurements and simulation estimates of the
homogeneous nucleation rate.

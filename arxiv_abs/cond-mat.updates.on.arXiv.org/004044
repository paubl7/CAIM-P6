Triangular lattice quantum antiferromagnet has recently emerged to be a promising playground
for realizing Dirac spin liquids (DSLs) -- a class of highly entangled quantum phases hosting emergent
gauge fields and gapless Dirac fermions. While previous theories and experiments focused mainly
on $S=1/2$ spin systems, more recently signals of a DSL were detected in an $S=3/2$ system $\alpha$-CrOOH(D).
In this work we develop a theory of DSLs on triangular lattice with spin-$S$ moments. We argue that
in the most natural scenario, a spin-$S$ system realizes a $U(2S)$ DSL, described at low energy by
gapless Dirac fermions coupled with an emergent $U(2S)$ gauge field (also known as $U(2S)$ QCD$_3$).
An appealing feature of this scenario is that at sufficiently large $S$, the $U(2S)$ QCD becomes
intrinsically unstable toward spontaneous symmetry breaking and confinement. The confined phase
is simply the $120^{\circ}$ coplanar magnetic order, which agrees with semiclassical (large-$S$)
results on simple Heisenberg-like models. Other scenarios are nevertheless possible, especially
at small $S$ when quantum fluctuations are strong. For $S=3/2$, we argue that a $U(1)$ DSL is also
theoretically possible and phenomenologically compatible with existing measurements. One way
to distinguish the $U(3)$ DSL from the $U(1)$ DSL is to break time-reversal symmetry, for example
by adding a spin chirality term $\vec{S}_i\cdot(\vec{S}_j\times\vec{S}_k)$ in numerical simulations:
the $U(1)$ DSL becomes the standard Kalmeyer-Laughlin chiral spin liquid with semion/anti-semion
excitation; the $U(3)$ DSL, in contrast, becomes a non-abelian chiral spin liquid described by
the $SU(2)_3$ topological order, with Fibonacci-like anyons.

The multiplicative decomposition model is widely employed for predicting residual stresses and
morphologies of biological tissues due to growth. However, it relies on the assumption that the
tissue is initially in a stress-free state, which conflicts with the observations that any growth
state of tissue is under a significant level of residual stresses that helps to maintain its ideal
mechanical conditions. Here, we propose a modified multiplicative decomposition model where
the initial state (or reference configuration) of biological tissue is endowed with residual stress
instead of being stress-free. Releasing theoretically the initial residual stress, the initially
stressed state is first transmitted into a virtual stress-free state, resulting in an initial elastic
deformation. The initial virtual stress-free state subsequently grows to another counterpart
with a growth deformation and the latter is further integrated into its natural configuration with
an excessive elastic deformation that ensures tissue compatibility. With this decomposition,
the total deformation may be expressed as the product of elastic deformation, growth deformation
and initial elastic deformation, while the corresponding free energy density depends on the initial
residual stress and the total deformation. We address three key issues: explicit expression of
the free energy density,predetermination of the initial elastic deformation, and initial residual
stress. Finally, we consider a tubular organ to demonstrate the effects of the proposed initial
residual stress on stress distribution and on shape formation through an incremental stability
analysis. Our results suggest that the initial residual stress exerts a major influence on the growth
stress and the morphology of tissues.

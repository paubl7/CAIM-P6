Motivated by recent discovery of yttrium-based high-temperature ternary superconducting hydrides
(e.g., CaYH$_{12}$, LaYH$_{12}$, and ScYH$_{6}$), we have employed evolutionary algorithm and
first-principles calculations to comprehensively examine the structural stability and superconductivity
of the YMgH$_{x}$ system at high pressure. The hydrogen content $x$ and the pressure are both important
factors in the stability of these candidate structures. We find that the stability of hydrogen-rich
materials frequently necessitates higher pressure. For instance, the pressures to stabilize
$P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{8}$ and $Cmmm$-YMgH$_{12}$ are both more than 250 GPa. Hydrogen-less materials,
such as $I4_{1}/amd$-YMgH$_{2}$ and $P6_{3}/mmc$-YMgH$_{3}$, can be stable at pressures as low
as 100 GPa. In addition, we find a metastable structure for YMgH$_{6}$ with the same space group as
the $P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{8}$. A metastable sodalite-like face-centered cubic (FCC) structure is
also found in YMgH$_{12}$. These four clathrate structures of $P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{6}$, $P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{8}$,
$Cmmm$-YMgH$_{12}$, and $Fd\bar{3}m$-YMgH$_{12}$ is made up of H14, H18, H24, and H24 cages, respectively,
in which the H-H pair exhibits weak covalent bonding. According to phonon calculations, $P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{6}$
and $P4/mmm$-YMgH$_{8}$ require a pressure of 300 GPa to maintain dynamic stability, however $Cmmm$-YMgH$_{12}$
and $Fd\bar{3}m$-YMgH$_{12}$ can maintain dynamic stability at pressures of 200 GPa and 250 GPa,
respectively. Electron-phonon coupling calculations indicate that they might be potential high-temperature
superconductors, with superconductivity intimately linked to the H cage structure. The sodalite
structure $Fd\bar{3}m$-YMgH$_{12}$ has a $T_\mathrm{c}$ value of 190 K and a strong electron-phonon
coupling constant of 2.18.

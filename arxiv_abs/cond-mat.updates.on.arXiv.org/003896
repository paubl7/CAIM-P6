Quite recently I have proposed a nonperturbative dynamical effective field model (DEFM) to quantitatively
describe the dynamics of interacting ferrofluids. Its predictions compare very well with the results
from simulations. In this paper I put the DEFM on firm theoretical ground by deriving it within the
framework of dynamical density functional theory (DDFT), in which the relevant part of correlation-induced
free energy is approximated by a function of the instantaneous magnetization. The DEFM is generalized
to inhomogeneous finite-size samples for which the macroscopic and mesoscopic scale separation
is nontrivial due to the presence of long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The demagnetizing
field naturally emerges from microscopic considerations and is consistently accounted for. The
resulting particle dynamics on the mesoscopic scale only involves macroscopically local quantities
such as local magnetization and Maxwell field. Nevertheless, the local demagnetizing field essentially
couples to magnetization at distant macroscopic locations. Thus, a two-scale parallel algorithm,
involving information transfer between different macroscopic locations, can be applied to fully
resolve particle rotational dynamics in an inhomogeneous sample. I also derive the DEFM for polydisperse
ferrofluids, in which the dynamics of particles belonging to different species can be strongly
coupled to each other. I discuss the underlying assumptions in obtaining a thermodynamically consistent
polydisperse magnetization relaxation equation, which is of the same generic form as that for monodisperse
ferrofluids. The theoretical advances presented in this paper are important for both qualitative
understanding and quantitative modeling of ferrofluid dynamics.

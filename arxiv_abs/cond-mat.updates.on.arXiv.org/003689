The molecular junction geometry is modelled in terms of nuclear degrees of freedom that are embedded
in a stochastic quantum environment of non-equilibrium electrons. Time-evolution of the molecular
geometry is governed via a mean force, a frictional force and a stochastic force, forces arising
from many electrons tunnelling across the junction for a given nuclear vibration. Conversely,
the current-driven nuclear dynamics feed back to the electronic current, which can be captured
according extended expressions for the current that have explicit dependencies on classical nuclear
velocities and accelerations. Current-induced nuclear forces and the non-adiabatic electric
current are computed using non-equilibrium Green's functions via a time-scale separation solution
of Keldysh-Kadanoff-Baym equations in Wigner space. Applying the theory to molecular junctions
demonstrated that non-adiabatic corrections play an important role when nuclear motion is considered
non-equilibrium and, in particular, showed that non-equilibrium and equilibrium descriptions
of nuclear motion produce significantly different current characteristics. It is observed that
non-equilibrium descriptions generally produce heightened conductance profiles relative to
the equilibrium descriptions and provide evidence that the effective temperature is an effective
measure of the steady-state characteristics. Finally, we observe that non-equilibrium descriptions
of nuclear motion can give rise to the Landauer blowtorch effect via the emergence of multi-minima
potential energy surfaces in conjunction with non-uniform temperature profiles. The Landauer
blowtorch effect and its impact on the current characteristics, waiting times and the Fano factor
are explored for an effective adiabatic potential that morphs between a single, double and triple
potential as a function of voltage.

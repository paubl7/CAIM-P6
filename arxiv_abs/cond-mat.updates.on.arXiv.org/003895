In the previous paper of this series [JCTC 2020, 16, 3757], we presented a theoretical and algorithmic
framework based on a localized representation of the occupied space that exploits the inherent
sparsity in the real-space evaluation of the EXX interaction in finite-gap systems. This was accompanied
by a detailed description of exx, a massively parallel hybrid MPI/OpenMP implementation of this
approach in Quantum ESPRESSO that enables linear-scaling hybrid DFT based AIMD in the NVE/NVT ensembles
of condensed-phase systems containing 500--1000 atoms (in fixed orthorhombic cells) with a wall
time cost comparable to semi-local DFT. In this work, we extend exx to enable hybrid DFT based AIMD
of large-scale condensed-phase systems with general and fluctuating cells in the NpH/NpT ensembles.
Our theoretical extension includes an analytical derivation of the EXX contribution to the stress
tensor for systems in general cells with a computational complexity that scales linearly with system
size. The corresponding algorithmic extensions to exx include optimized routines that: (i) handle
static/fluctuating cells with non-orthogonal lattice symmetries, (ii) solve Poisson's equation
in general cells via an automated selection of the auxiliary grid directions in the Natan-Kronik
representation of the discrete Laplacian operator, and (iii) evaluate the EXX contribution to
the stress tensor. We also critically assess the computational performance of the extended exx
module across several different HPC architectures via case studies on ice Ih, II, and III as well
as ambient liquid water. We find that the extended exx can evaluate the EXX contribution to the stress
tensor with negligible cost (< 1%) and remains highly scalable, thereby bringing us another step
closer to routinely performing hybrid DFT based AIMD for large-scale condensed-phase systems
across a wide range of thermodynamic conditions.

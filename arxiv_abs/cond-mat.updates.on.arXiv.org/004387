The three-dimensional Anderson model represents a paradigmatic model to understand the Anderson
localization transition. In this work we first review some key results obtained for this model in
the past 50 years, and then study its properties from the perspective of modern numerical approaches.
Our main focus is on the quantitative comparison between the level sensitivity statistics and the
level statistics. While the former studies the sensitivity of Hamiltonian eigenlevels upon inserting
a magnetic flux, the latter studies the properties of unperturbed eigenlevels. We define two versions
of dimensionless conductance, the first corresponding to the width of the level curvature distribution
relative to the mean level spacing, and the second corresponding to the ratio of the Heisenberg and
the Thouless time obtained from the spectral form factor. We show that both conductances look remarkably
similar around the localization transition, in particular, they predict a nearly identical critical
point consistent with other measures of the transition. We then study some further properties of
those quantities: for level curvatures, we discuss particular similarities and differences between
the width of the level curvature distribution and the characteristic energy studied by Edwards
and Thouless in their pioneering work [J. Phys. C. 5, 807 (1972)]. In the context of the spectral form
factor, we show that at the critical point it enters a broad time-independent regime, in which its
value is consistent with the level compressibility obtained from the level variance. Finally,
we test the scaling solution of the average level spacing ratio in the crossover regime using the
cost function minimization approach introduced in [Phys. Rev. B. 102, 064207 (2020)]. We find that
the extracted transition point and the scaling coefficient agree with those from the literature
to high numerical accuracy.

As a secondary structure of DNA, DNA tetrahedra exhibit intriguing charge transport phenomena
and provide a promising platform for wide applications like biosensors, as shown in recent electrochemical
experiments. Here, we study charge transport in a multi-terminal DNA tetrahedron, finding that
its charge transport properties strongly depend upon the interplay among contact position, on-site
energy disorder, and base-pair mismatch. Our results indicate that the charge transport efficiency
is nearly independent of contact position in the weak disorder regime, and is dramatically declined
by the occurrence of a single base-pair mismatch between the source and the drain, in accordance
with experimental results [J. Am. Chem. Soc. {\bf 134}, 13148 (2012); Chem. Sci. {\bf 9}, 979 (2018)].
By contrast, the charge transport efficiency could be enhanced monotonically by shifting the source
toward the drain in the strong disorder regime, and be increased when the base-pair mismatch takes
place exactly at the contact position. In particular, when the source moves successively from the
top vertex to the drain, the charge transport through the tetrahedral DNA device can be separated
into three regimes, ranging from disorder-induced linear decrement of charge transport to disorder-insensitive
charge transport, and to disorder-enhanced charge transport. Finally, we predict that the DNA
tetrahedron functions as a more efficient spin filter compared to double-stranded DNA and opposite
spin polarization could be observed at different drains, which may be used to separate spin-unpolarized
electrons into spin-up ones and spin-down ones. These results could be readily checked by electrochemical
measurements and may help for designing novel DNA tetrahedron-based molecular nanodevices.

Topological superconductors represent a phase of matter with nonlocal properties which cannot
smoothly change from one phase to another, providing a robustness suitable for quantum computing.
Substantial progress has been made towards a qubit based on Majorana modes, non-Abelian anyons
of Ising ($Z_2$) topological order whose exchange$-$braiding$-$produces topologically protected
logic operations. However, because braiding Ising anyons does not offer a universal quantum gate
set, Majorana qubits are computationally limited. This drawback can be overcome by introducing
parafermions, a novel generalized set of non-Abelian modes ($Z_n$), an array of which supports
universal topological quantum computation. The primary route to synthesize parafermions involves
inducing superconductivity in the fractional quantum Hall (fqH) edge. Here we use high-quality
graphene-based van der Waals devices with narrow superconducting niobium nitride (NbN) electrodes,
in which superconductivity and robust fqH coexist. We find crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) across
the superconductor separating two counterpropagating fqH edges which demonstrates their superconducting
pairing. Our observed CAR probability of the integer edges is insensitive to magnetic field, temperature,
and filling, which provides evidence for spin-orbit coupling inherited from NbN enabling the pairing
of the otherwise spin-polarized edges. FqH edges notably exhibit a CAR probability higher than
that of integer edges once fully developed. This fqH CAR probability remains nonzero down to our
lowest accessible temperature, suggesting superconducting pairing of fractional charges. These
results provide a route to realize novel topological superconducting phases with universal braiding
statistics in fqH-superconductor hybrid devices based on graphene and NbN.

Interactions are essential for the creation of correlated quantum many-body states. While two-body
interactions underlie most natural phenomena, three- and four-body interactions are important
for the physics of nuclei [1], exotic few-body states in ultracold quantum gases [2], the fractional
quantum Hall effect [3], quantum error correction [4], and holography [5, 6]. Recently, a number
of artificial quantum systems have emerged as simulators for many-body physics, featuring the
ability to engineer strong interactions. However, the interactions in these systems have largely
been limited to the two-body paradigm, and require building up multi-body interactions by combining
two-body forces. Here, we demonstrate a pure N-body interaction between microwave photons stored
in an arbitrary number of electromagnetic modes of a multimode cavity. The system is dressed such
that there is collectively no interaction until a target total photon number is reached across multiple
distinct modes, at which point they interact strongly. The microwave cavity features 9 modes with
photon lifetimes of $\sim 2$ ms coupled to a superconducting transmon circuit, forming a multimode
circuit QED system with single photon cooperativities of $\sim10^9$. We generate multimode interactions
by using cavity photon number resolved drives on the transmon circuit to blockade any multiphoton
state with a chosen total photon number distributed across the target modes. We harness the interaction
for state preparation, preparing Fock states of increasing photon number via quantum optimal control
pulses acting only on the cavity modes. We demonstrate multimode interactions by generating entanglement
purely with uniform cavity drives and multimode photon blockade, and characterize the resulting
two- and three-mode W states using a new protocol for multimode Wigner tomography.

The curling spin wave modes of a ferromagnetic vortex confined to a microscale disc have been directly
imaged in response to a microwave field excitation using time-resolved scanning Kerr microscopy.
Micromagnetic simulations have been used to explore the interaction of gyrotropic vortex core
dynamics with the curling modes observed in the region of circulating in-plane magnetization.
Hybridization of the fundamental gyrotropic mode with the degenerate, lowest-frequency, azimuthal
modes has previously been reported to lead to their splitting and counter propagating motion, as
we observe in our spectra and measured images. The curling nature of the modes can be ascribed to asymmetry
in the static and dynamic magnetization across the disc thickness, but here we also present evidence
that spiral spin waves emitted by the core can influence the spatial character of higher frequency
curling modes for which hybridization is only permitted with gyrotropic modes of the same sense
of azimuthal motion. While it is challenging to identify if such modes are truly hybridized from
the mode dispersion in a confined disc, our simulations reveal that spiral spin waves from the core
may act as mediators of the interaction between the core dynamics and azimuthal modes. At higher
frequency, modes with radial character only do not exhibit marked curling, but instead show evidence
of interaction with spin waves generated at the edge of the disc. The measured spatio-temporal character
of the observed curling modes is accurately reproduced by our simulations, which reveal the emission
of propagating short-wavelength spiral spin waves from both core and edge regions of the disc. Our
simulations suggest that the propagating modes are not inconsequential, but may play a role in the
dynamic overlap required for hybridization of modes of the core and in-plane magnetised regions.

Twisted double bilayer graphene (TDBG) is an electric-field-tunable moire system, exhibiting
electron correlated states and related temperature linear (T-linear) resistivity. The displacement
field provides a new knob to in-situ tune the relative strength of electron interactions in TDBG,
yielding not only a rich phase diagram but also the ability to investigate each phase individually.
Here, we report a study of carrier density (n), displacement field (D) and twist angle dependence
of T-linear resistivity in TDBG. For a large twist angle 1.5 degree where correlated insulating
states are absent, we observe a T-linear resistivity (order of 10 Ohm per K) over a wide range of carrier
density and its slope decreases with increasing of n before reaching the van Hove singularity, in
agreement with acoustic phonon scattering model. The slope of T-linear resistivity is non-monotonically
dependent on displacement field, with a single peak structure closely connected to single-particle
van Hove Singularity (vHS) in TDBG. For an optimal twist angle of ~1.23 degree in the presence of correlated
states, the slope of T-linear resistivity is found maximum at the boundary of the correlated halo
regime (order of 100 Ohm per K), resulting a 'M' shape displacement field dependence. The observation
is beyond the phonon scattering model from single particle picture, and instead it suggests a strange
metal behavior. We interpret the observation as a result of symmetry-breaking instability developed
at quantum critical points where electron degeneracy changes. Our results demonstrate that TDBG
is an ideal system to study the interplay between phonon and quantum criticality, and might help
to map out the evolution of the order parameters for the ground states.

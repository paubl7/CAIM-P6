One of the most celebrated contributions to the study of mechanics of materials is due to J.D. Eshelby,
who in the late 50s revolutionized our understanding of the elastic stress and strain fields due
to an ellipsoidal inclusion undergoing a transformation of shape and size. While Eshelby's work
laid the foundation for significant advancements in various fields, including fracture mechanics,
phase transformations, and homogenization methods, its extension into the range of large deformations,
and to situations in which the material can actively reorganize in response to the finite transformation
strain, is in a nascent state. Beyond the theoretical difficulties imposed by highly nonlinear
material response, a major hindrance has been the absence of experimental observations that can
elucidate the intricacies that arise in this regime. To address this limitation, our experimental
observations reveal the key morphogenesis steps of Vibrio cholerae biofilms embedded in hydrogels
imaged at the single-cell level, as they grow by four orders of magnitude from their initial size.
Through combination of mutagenesis and careful hydrogel fabrication protocols we separately
tune the mechanical properties of the matrix and the inclusion to uncover the sensitivities of the
morphogenesis process. Using the biofilm growth as a case study, our model considers various growth
scenarios and employs two different and complimentary methods to obtain equilibrium solutions.
A particular emphasis is put on determining the natural growth path of an inclusion that optimizes
its shape in response to the confinement, and the onset of damage in the matrix, which together explain
the observed behavior of biofilms. This work sheds light on the role of mechanics in determining
the morphogenesis pathways of confined growing bodies and thus applies to a broad range of phenomena
in both natural and engineered systems.

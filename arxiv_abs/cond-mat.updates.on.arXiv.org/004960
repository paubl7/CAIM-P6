The dynamical electric behavior of a NiTi smart alloy thin filament when driven by time varying current
pulses is studied by a structure-based phenomenological model that includes rate-based effects.
The simulation model relates the alloy's electrical resistivity to the relative proportions of
the three main structural phases namely Martensite, Austenite and R-phase, experimentally known
to exist in NiTi alloy lattice structure. The relative proportions of the phases depend on temperature
and applied stress. Temperature varies due to the self-heating of the filament by the Joule effect
when a current pulse passes and also due to convective/radiative interchange with the ambient.
The temperature variation with time causes structural phase transitions, which result in abrupt
changes in the sample resistivity as the proportions of each lattice phase vary. The model is described
by a system of four 1st-order nonlinear differential-algebraic equations yielding the temporal
evolution of resistivity and output voltage across the filament for any given time-varying input
current pulse. The model corresponds to a 4th-order extended memristor, described by four state
variables, which are the proportions of each of the three NiTi lattice phases and temperature. Simulations
are experimentally verified by comparing to measurements obtained for samples self-heated by
triangular current input waveforms as well as for passively samples with no current input. Numerical
results reproduce very well measurements of resistance vs. temperature at equilibrium as well
as the full dynamics of experimentally observed I-V characteristic curves and resistance vs. driving
current for time-varying current input waveforms of a wide range of frequencies (0.01-10~Hz).

We investigate interacting spin susceptibilities in lattice models for $\mathcal{T}$-reversal
symmetry-broken Weyl semimetals. We employ a random phase approximation (RPA) method for the spin-SU(2)-symmetry-broken
case that includes mixtures of ladder and bubble diagrams, beyond a SU(2)-symmetric case. Within
this approach, the relations between the tendency towards magnetic order and the band structure
tilt parameter $\gamma$ under different temperatures are explored. The critical interaction
strength $U_c$ for magnetic ordering decreases as the tilt term changes from type-I Weyl semimetals
to type-II. The lower temperature, the sharper is the drop in $U_c$ at the critical point between
them. The variation of $U_c$ with a slight doping near half-filling is also studied. It is generally
found that these Weyl systems show a strongly anisotropic spin response with an enhanced doubly
degenerate transverse susceptibility perpendicular to tilt direction, inherited from $\mathcal{C}_{4z}$
rational symmetry of bare Hamiltonian, but with the longitudinal response suppressed with respect
to that. For small tilts $\gamma$ and strong enough interaction, we find two degenerate ordering
patterns with spin order orthogonal to the tilt direction but much shorter spin correlation length
parallel to the spin direction. With increasing the tilt, the system develops instabilities with
respect to in-plane magnetic orders with wavevector $(0,\pi, q_z)$ and $(\pi,0, q_z)$, with $q_z$
increasing from 0 to $\pi$ before the transition to a type-II Weyl semimetal is reached. These results
indicate a greater richness of magnetic phases in correlated Weyl semimetals that also pose challenges
for precise theoretical descriptions.

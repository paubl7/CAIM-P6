We highlight a general theory to engineer arbitrary Hermitian tight-binding lattice models in
electrical LC circuits, where the lattice sites are replaced by the electrical nodes, connected
to its neighbors and to the ground by capacitors and inductors. In particular, by supplementing
each node with $n$ subnodes, where the phases of the current and voltage are the $n$ distinct roots
of \emph{unity}, one can in principle realize arbitrary hopping amplitude between the sites or
nodes via the \emph{shift capacitor coupling} between them. This general principle is then implemented
to construct a plethora of topological models in electrical circuits, \emph{topolectric circuits},
where the robust zero-energy topological boundary modes manifest through a large boundary impedance,
when the circuit is tuned to the resonance frequency. The simplicity of our circuit constructions
is based on the fact that the existence of the boundary modes relies only on the Clifford algebra of
the corresponding Hermitian matrices entering the Hamiltonian and not on their particular representation.
This in turn enables us to implement a wide class of topological models through rather simple topolectric
circuits with nodes consisting of only two subnodes. We anchor these outcomes from the numerical
computation of the on-resonance impedance in circuit realizations of first-order ($m=1$), such
as Chern and quantum spin Hall insulators, and second- ($m=2$) and third- ($m=3$) order topological
insulators in different dimensions, featuring sharp localization on boundaries of codimensionality
$d_c=m$. Finally, we subscribe to the \emph{stacked topolectric circuit} construction to engineer
three-dimensional Weyl, nodal-loop, quadrupolar Dirac and Weyl semimetals, respectively displaying
surface and hinge localized impedance.

A two-dimensional (2D) material system with both piezoelectricity and ferromagnetic (FM) order,
referred to as a 2D piezoelectric ferromagnetism (PFM), may open up unprecedented opportunities
for intriguing physics. Inspired by experimentally synthesized Janus monolayer MoSSe from $\mathrm{MoS_2}$,
in this work, the Janus monolayer $\mathrm{CrBr_{1.5}I_{1.5}}$ with dynamic, mechanical and
thermal stabilities is predicted, which is constructed from synthesized ferromagnetic $\mathrm{CrI_3}$
monolayer by replacing the top I atomic layer with Br atoms. Calculated results show that monolayer
$\mathrm{CrBr_{1.5}I_{1.5}}$ is an intrinsic FM half semiconductor with valence and conduction
bands being fully spin-polarized in the same spin direction. Furthermore, monolayer $\mathrm{CrBr_{1.5}I_{1.5}}$
possesses a sizable magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE). By symmetry analysis, it is found that both
in-plane and out-of-plane piezoelectric polarizations can be induced by a uniaxial strain in the
basal plane. The calculated in-plane $d_{22}$ value of 0.557 pm/V is small. However, more excitingly,
the out-of-plane $d_{31}$ is as high as 1.138 pm/V, which is obviously higher compared with ones
of other 2D known materials. The strong out of-plane piezoelectricity is highly desirable for ultrathin
piezoelectric devices. Moreover, strain engineering is used to tune piezoelectricity of monolayer
$\mathrm{CrBr_{1.5}I_{1.5}}$. It is found that compressive strain can improve the $d_{22}$,
and tensile strain can enhance the $d_{31}$. A FM order to antiferromagnetic (AFM) order phase transition
can be induced by compressive strain, and the critical point is about 0.95 strain. That is to say that
a 2D piezoelectric antiferromagnetism (PAFM) can be achieved by compressive strain, and the corresponding
$d_{22}$ and $d_{31}$ are 0.677 pm/V and 0.999 pm/V at 0.94 strain, respectively.

Based upon the resistor analogy and using the ideal loop gas approximation(ILGA) it is shown that
only pending loops reduce the modulus of an otherwise perfect network made of monodisperse strands
and junctions of identical functionality. Thus, the cycle rank of the network with pending structures
removed (cyclic and branched) is sufficient to characterize modulus, if the resistor analogy can
be employed. It is further shown that it is impossible to incorporate finite cycles into a polymer
network such that individual network strands are at equilibrium conformations while maintaining
simultaneously a force balance at the junctions. Therefore, the resistor analogy provides only
an approximation for the phantom modulus of networks containing finite loops. Improved approaches
to phantom modulus can be constructed from considering a force balance at the junctions, which requires
knowledge of the distribution of cross-link fluctuations in imperfect networks. Assuming loops
with equilibrium conformations and a force balance at all loop junctions, a lower bound estimate
for the phantom modulus, $G_{\text{ph}}\approx\left(\xi-c_{\text{f}}L_{1}\right)kT/V$
is obtained within the ILGA for end-linked model networks and in the limit of $L_{1}\ll\xi$. Here,
$L_{1}$ is the number of primary ("pending") loops, $\xi$ the cycle rank of the network, $k$ the Boltzmann
constant, $V$ the volume of the sample, and $T$ the absolute temperature. $c_{\text{f}}$ is a functionality
dependent coefficient that is $\approx2.56$ for junction functionality $f=3$ and $\approx3.06$
for $f=4$, while it converges quickly towards $\approx4.2$ in the limit of large $f$. Further corrections
to phantom modulus beyond finite loops are addressed briefly.

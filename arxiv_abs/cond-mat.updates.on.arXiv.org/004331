Displacing liquid in a confined space is important for technological processes, ranging from porous
membrane separation to CO$_{2}$ sequestration. The liquid to be displaced usually consists of
multiple components with different solubilities in the displacing liquid. Phase separation and
chemical composition gradients in the liquids can influence the displacement rate. In this work,
we investigate the effects of liquid composition on the displacement process of ternary liquid
mixtures in a quasi-2D microchannel where liquid-liquid phase separation occurs concurrently.
We focused on model ternary mixtures containing 1-octanol, ethanol, and water. These mixtures
are displaced with water or with ethanol aqueous solution. The spatial distribution of subphases
arising from phase separation and the displacement rates of the solution are impacted by the initial
ternary solution composition. The boundary between the solution and displacing liquid changes
from a defined interface to a diffusive interface as the initial 1-octanol composition in the solution
is reduced. The displacement rate also varies non-linearly with the initial 1-octanol composition.
The slowest displacement rate arises in the intermediate 1-octanol concentration, where a stable
three-zone configuration forms at the boundary. At very low 1-octanol concentration, the displacement
rate is fast, associated with droplet formation and motion driven by the chemical concentration
gradients formed during phase separation. The excessive energy provided from phase separation
may contribute to the enhanced displacement at intermediate to high 1-octanol concentrations,
but not at the low 1-octanol concentration with enhancement from induced flow in confinement. The
knowledge gained from this study highlights the importance of manipulating phase separation to
enhance mass transport in confinement for a wide range of separation processes.

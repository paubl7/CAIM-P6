The recently proposed map [arXiv:2011.01415] between the hydrodynamic equations governing the
two-dimensional triangular cold-bosonic breathers [Phys. Rev. X 9, 021035 (2019)] and the high-density
zero-temperature triangular free-fermionic clouds, both trapped harmonically, perfectly explains
the former phenomenon but leaves uninterpreted the nature of the initial ($t=0$) singularity.
This singularity is a density discontinuity that leads, in the bosonic case, to an infinite force
at the cloud edge. The map itself becomes invalid at times $t<0$. A similar singularity appears at
$t = T/4$, where $T$ is the period of the harmonic trap, with the Fermi-Bose map becoming invalid at
$t > T/4$. Here, we first map -- using the scale invariance of the problem -- the trapped motion to an
untrapped one. Then we show that in the new representation, the solution [arXiv:2011.01415] becomes,
along a ray in the direction normal to one of the three edges of the initial cloud, a freely propagating
one-dimensional shock wave of a class proposed by Damski in [Phys.~Rev.~A 69, 043610 (2004)]. There,
for a broad class of initial conditions, the one-dimensional hydrodynamic equations can be mapped
to the inviscid Burgers' equation, which is equivalent to a nonlinear transport equation. More
specifically, under the Damski map, the $t=0$ singularity of the original problem becomes, verbatim,
the initial condition for the wave catastrophe solution found by Chandrasekhar in 1943 [Ballistic
Research Laboratory Report No. 423 (1943)]. At $t=T/8$, our interpretation ceases to exist: at
this instance, all three effectively one-dimensional shock waves emanating from each of the three
sides of the initial triangle collide at the origin, and the 2D-1D correspondence between the solution
of [arXiv:2011.01415] and the Damski-Chandrasekhar shock wave becomes invalid.

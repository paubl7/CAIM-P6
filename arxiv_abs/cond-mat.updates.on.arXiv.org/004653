This paper considers a main particle and an incident particle classical mechanics elastic collision
preserving energy and momentum while ignoring the angular momentum, spin or other particle characteristics.
The main result of the paper shows that the colliding two particle classical Hamiltonian energy
can be represented in four weighted individual particle in symmetric and anti-symmetric (osmotic)
terms similar to the quadratic Nelson measure used in the derivation of the Schrodinger wave function.
Following Nelson, if the second particle behavior can be captured in a potential and the ingoing
and outgoing velocities of the main particle are modelled using stochastic differential equations
the motion of the main particle satisfies the Schrodinger's equation. The diffusion variance of
this equation is replaced by a related ratio of masses and the assumed variance. The first example
attempts to reconcile this result with quantum mechanics by considering the Schrodinger equation
in the presence of only one type of incident particle. The main particle energy levels become multiples
of the incident particle and the energy expression for the entire system agrees with quantum mechanics
but there are differences with the stochastic equation. The Schrodinger equation can also be used
to represent corrections for Newton's equation and suggests a user profile to be used in the search
for Dark Matter. An alternative solution to the collision model also shows relativistic properties
as the interactions suggest corrections to the Minkowski equation in Einstein's Special Relativity.
It is also possible to use the classical Schrodinger's equation both on the main and incident particle
simultaneously leading to a correlated set of wave equations with different diffusion parameters.

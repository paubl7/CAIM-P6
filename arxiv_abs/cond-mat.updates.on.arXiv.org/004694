Bulk amorphous materials have been studied extensively and are widely used, yet their atomic arrangement
remains an open issue. Although they are generally believed to be Zachariasen continuous random
networks, recent experimental evidence favours the competing crystallite model in the case of
amorphous silicon. In two-dimensional materials, however, the corresponding questions remain
unanswered. Here we report the synthesis, by laser-assisted chemical vapour deposition, of centimetre-scale,
free-standing, continuous and stable monolayer amorphous carbon, topologically distinct from
disordered graphene. Unlike in bulk materials, the structure of monolayer amorphous carbon can
be determined by atomic-resolution imaging. Extensive characterization by Raman and X-ray spectroscopy
and transmission electron microscopy reveals the complete absence of long-range periodicity
and a threefold-coordinated structure with a wide distribution of bond lengths, bond angles, and
five-, six-, seven- and eight-member rings. The ring distribution is not a Zachariasen continuous
random network, but resembles the competing (nano)crystallite model. We construct a corresponding
model that enables density-functional-theory calculations of the properties of monolayer amorphous
carbon, in accordance with observations. Direct measurements confirm that it is insulating, with
resistivity values similar to those of boron nitride grown by chemical vapour deposition. Free-standing
monolayer amorphous carbon is surprisingly stable and deforms to a high breaking strength, without
crack propagation from the point of fracture. The excellent physical properties of this stable,
free-standing monolayer amorphous carbon could prove useful for permeation and diffusion barriers
in applications such as magnetic recording devices and flexible electronics.

We examine the collective states of run-and-tumble active matter disks driven over a periodic obstacle
array. When the drive is applied along a symmetry direction of the array, we find a clog-free uniform
liquid state for low activity, while at higher activity, the density becomes increasingly heterogeneous
and an active clogged state emerges in which the mobility is strongly reduced. For driving along
non-symmetry or incommensurate directions, there are two different clogging behaviors consisting
of a drive dependent clogged state in the low activity thermal limit and a drive independent clogged
state at high activity. These regimes are separated by a uniform flowing liquid at intermediate
activity. There is a critical activity level above which the thermal clogged state does not occur,
as well as an optimal activity level that maximizes the disk mobility. Thermal clogged states are
dependent on the driving direction while active clogged states are not. In the low activity regime,
diluting the obstacles produces a monotonic increase in the mobility; however, for large activities,
the mobility is more robust against obstacle dilution. We also examine the velocity-force curves
for driving along non-symmetry directions, and find that they are linear when the activity is low
or intermediate, but become nonlinear at high activity and show behavior similar to that found for
the plastic depinning of solids. At higher drives the active clustering is lost. For low activity
we also find a reentrant fluid phase, where the system transitions from a high mobility fluid at low
drives to a clogged state at higher drives and then back into another fluid phase at very high drives.
We map the regions in which the thermally clogged, partially clogged, active uniform fluid, clustered
fluid, active clogged, and directionally locked states occur as a function of disk density, drift
force, and activity.

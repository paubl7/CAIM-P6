Nanometer-scale imaging of magnetization and current density is the key to deciphering the mechanisms
behind a variety of new and poorly understood condensed matter phenomena. The recently discovered
correlated states hosted in atomically layered materials such as twisted bilayer graphene or van
der Waals heterostructures are noteworthy examples. Manifestations of these states range from
superconductivity, to highly insulating states, to magnetism. Their fragility and susceptibility
to spatial inhomogeneities limits their macroscopic manifestation and complicates conventional
transport or magnetization measurements, which integrate over an entire sample. In contrast,
techniques for imaging weak magnetic field patterns with high spatial resolution overcome inhomogeneity
by measuring the local fields produced by magnetization and current density. Already, such imaging
techniques have shown the vulnerability of correlated states in twisted bilayer graphene to twist-angle
disorder and revealed the complex current flows in quantum Hall edge states. Here, we review the
state-of-the-art techniques most amenable to the investigation of such systems, because they
combine the highest magnetic field sensitivity with the highest spatial resolution and are minimally
invasive: magnetic force microscopy, scanning superconducting quantum interference device
microscopy, and scanning nitrogen-vacancy center microscopy. We compare the capabilities of
these techniques, their required operating conditions, and assess their suitability to different
types of source contrast, in particular magnetization and current density. Finally, we focus on
the prospects for improving each technique and speculate on its potential impact, especially in
the rapidly growing field of two-dimensional (2D) materials.

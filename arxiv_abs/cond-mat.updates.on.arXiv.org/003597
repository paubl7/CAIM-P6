Quantum-mechanical (QM) simulations, thanks to their predictive power, can provide significant
insights into the nature and dynamics of defects such as vacancies, dislocations and grain boundaries.
These considerations are essential in the context of the development of reliable, inexpensive
and environmentally friendly alloys. However, despite significant progress in computer performance,
QM simulations of defects are still extremely time-consuming with ab-initio/non-parametric
methods. The two-centre Slater-Koster (SK) tight-binding (TB) models can achieve significant
computational efficiency and provide an interpretable picture of the electronic structure. In
some cases, this makes TB a compelling alternative to models based on abstraction of the electronic
structure, such as the embedded atom model. The biggest challenge in the implementation of the SK
method is the estimation of the optimal and transferable parameters that are used to construct the
Hamiltonian matrix. In this paper, we will present results of the development of a data-driven framework,
following the classical approach of adjusting parameters in order to recreate properties that
can be measured or estimated using ab-initio or non-parametric methods. Distinct features include
incorporation of data from QSGW (quasi-particle self-consistent GW approximation) calculations,
as well as consideration of higher-order elastic constants. Furthermore, we provide a description
of the optimisation procedure, omitted in many publications, including the design stage. We also
apply modern optimisation techniques that allow us to minimise constraints on the parameter space.
In summary, this paper introduces some methodological improvements to the semi-empirical approach
while addressing associated challenges and advantages.

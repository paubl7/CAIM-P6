Soft robotics requires materials that are capable of large deformation and amenable to actuation
with external stimuli such as electric fields. Energy harvesting, biomedical devices, flexible
electronics and sensors are some other applications enabled by electro-active soft materials.
The phenomenon of flexoelectricity is an enticing alternative that refers to the development of
electric polarization in dielectrics when subjected to strain gradients. In particular, flexoelectricity
offers a direct linear coupling between a highly desirable deformation mode (flexure) and electric
stimulus. Unfortunately, barring some exceptions, the flexoelectric effect is quite weak and
rather substantial bending curvatures are required for an appreciable electro-mechanical response.
Most experiments in the literature appear to confirm modest flexoelectricity in polymers although
perplexingly, a singular work has measured a "giant" effect in elastomers under some specific conditions.
Due to the lack of an understanding of the microscopic underpinnings of flexoelectricity in elastomers
and a commensurate theory, it is not currently possible to either explain the contradictory experimental
results on elastomers or pursue avenues for possible design of large flexoelectricity. In this
work, we present a statistical-mechanics theory for the emergent flexoelectricity of elastomers
consisting of polar monomers. The theory is shown to be valid in broad generality and leads to key
insights regarding both giant flexoelectricity and material design. In particular, the theory
shows that, in standard elastomer networks, combining stretching and bending is a mechanism for
obtaining giant flexoelectricity, which also explains the aforementioned, surprising experimental
discovery.

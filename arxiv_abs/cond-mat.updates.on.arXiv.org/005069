Tribological loading of metals induces microstructural changes by dislocation-mediated plastic
deformation. During continued sliding, combined shear and lattice rotation result in the formation
of crystallographic textures which influence friction and wear at the sliding interface. In order
to elucidate the fundamental lattice rotation kinematics involved in this process during the early
stages of sliding, we conducted unlubricated, single pass sliding experiments on a copper bicrystal.
Electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) performed directly on the bulk surface of the wear tracks
in the vicinity of the bicrystal grain boundary reveals subgrain formation and crystal lattice
rotations by approximately up to 35{\deg}. Predominantly, the tribologically induced crystal
rotations appear to be kinematically constrained to rotations around the transverse direction
(TD) and occur in both grains, irrespective of load. We demonstrate that inverting the sliding direction
(SD) inverts the sense of crystal rotation, but does not change the principal nature of rotation
for the majority of indexed EBSD data. A lower proportion of the crystal lattice rotates much farther
around TD (roughly up to 90{\deg}), accompanied by a superimposed crystal rotation around SD. Detailed
analysis reveals that sliding direction and grain orientation possess a systematic influence
of how crystal rotations are accommodated. This observation is rationalized in terms of geometry,
anisotropic wear track profiles and slip traces. Under very specific conditions, combined crystal
rotation and twinning are observed. These detailed insights into the fundamental nature of tribologically
induced lattice rotation kinematics may be instrumental in the development of materials with superior
tribological properties.

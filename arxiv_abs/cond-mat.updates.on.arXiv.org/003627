We theoretically deduce the basic requirements for the existence of Majorana bound states in quasi-1D
superconductors. Namely, we demonstrate that any quasi-1D system in the regime of one Fermi surface
(i.e., one pair of Fermi points with right- and left-moving electrons) exhibits a nondegenerate
Majorana bound state at the Fermi level at its boundary that is an interface with vacuum (sample termination)
or an insulator, once a gapped superconducting state is induced in it. We prove this using the symmetry-based
formalism of low-energy continuum models and general boundary conditions. We derive the most general
form of the Bogoliubov-de-Gennes low-energy Hamiltonian that is subject only to charge-conjugation
symmetry $\mathcal{C}_+$ of the type $\mathcal{C}_+^2=+1$. Crucially, we also derive the most
general form of the boundary conditions, subject only to the fundamental principle of the probability-current
conservation and $\mathcal{C}_+$ symmetry. We find that there are two families of them, which we
term "normal-reflection" and "Andreev-reflection" boundary conditions. For the normal-reflection
boundary conditions, which physically represent a boundary that is an interface with vacuum or
an insulator, we find that a Majorana bound state always exists, as long as the bulk is in the gapped
superconducting state, irrespective of the parameters of the bulk Hamiltonian and boundary conditions.
Importantly, our general model includes the possible Fermi-point mismatch, when the two Fermi
points are not at exactly opposite momenta, which disfavors superconductivity. We find that the
Fermi-point mismatch does not have a direct destructive effect on the Majorana bound state, in the
sense that once the bulk gap is opened the bound state is always present.

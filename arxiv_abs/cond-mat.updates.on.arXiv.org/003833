Broadening the knowledge and understanding on the magnetic correlations in van der Waals layered
magnets is critical in realizing their potential next-generation applications. In this study,
we employ high frequency (240 GHz) electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy on plate-like CrBr$_{3}$
to gain insight into the magnetic interactions as a function of temperature (200 - 4 K) and the angle
of rotation ${\theta}$. We find that the temperature dependence of the ESR linewidth is well described
by the Ginzberg-Landau critical model as well as Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition
model, indicative of the presence of two-dimensional (2D) correlations. This suggests that the
three-dimensional ferromagnet CrBr$_{3}$, which has been described as an Ising or Heisenberg
ferromagnet, could present 2D magnetic correlations and BKT-like behavior even in its bulk form;
an observation that, to the best of our knowledge, has not been reported in the literature. Furthermore,
our findings show that the resonance field follows a $(3cos^2{\theta} - 1)$-like angular dependence,
while the linewidth follows a $(3cos^2{\theta} - 1)^2$-like angular dependence. This observed
angular dependence of the resonance field and linewidth further confirm an unanticipated 2D magnetic
behavior in CrBr$_{3}$. This behavior is likely due to the interaction of the external magnetic
field applied during the ESR experiment that allows for the mediation of long-range vortex-like
correlations between the spin clusters that may have formed due to magnetic phase separation. This
study demonstrates the significance of employing spin sensitive techniques such as ESR to better
understand the magnetic correlations in similar van der Waals magnets.

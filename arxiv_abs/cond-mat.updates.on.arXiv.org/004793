We report the observation of superconductivity in rhombohedral trilayer graphene electrostatically
doped with holes. Superconductivity occurs in two distinct regions within the space of gate-tuned
charge carrier density and applied electric displacement field, which we denote SC1 and SC2. The
high sample quality allows for detailed mapping of the normal state Fermi surfaces by quantum oscillations,
which reveal that in both cases superconductivity arises from a normal state described by an annular
Fermi sea that is proximal to an isospin symmetry breaking transition where the Fermi surface degeneracy
changes. The upper out-of-plane critical field $B_{C\perp}\approx 10 \mathrm{mT}$ for SC1 and
$1\mathrm{mT}$ for SC2, implying coherence lengths $\xi$ of 200nm and 600nm, respectively. The
simultaneous observation of transverse magnetic electron focusing implies a mean free path $\ell\gtrsim3.5\mathrm{\mu
m}$. Superconductivity is thus deep in the clean limit, with the disorder parameter $d=\xi/\ell<0.1$.
SC1 emerge from a paramagnetic normal state and is suppressed with in-plane magnetic fields in agreement
with the Pauli paramagnetic limit. In contrast, SC2 emerges from a spin-polarized, valley-unpolarized
half-metal. Measurements of the in-plane critical field show that this superconductor exceeds
the Pauli limit by at least one order of magnitude. We discuss our results in light of several mechanisms
including conventional phonon-mediated pairing, pairing due to fluctuations of the proximal
isospin order, and intrinsic instabilities of the annular Fermi liquid. Our observation of superconductivity
in a clean and structurally simple two-dimensional metal hosting a variety of gate tuned magnetic
states may enable a new class of field-effect controlled mesoscopic electronic devices combining
correlated electron phenomena.

The adsorbed atoms exhibit tendency to occupy a triangular lattice formed by periodic potential
of the underlying crystal surface. Such a lattice is formed by, e.g., a single layer of graphane or
the graphite surfaces as well as (111) surface of face-cubic center crystals. In the present work,
an extension of the lattice gas model to $S=1/2$ fermionic particles on the two-dimensional triangular
(hexagonal) lattice is analyzed. In such a model, each lattice site can be occupied not by only one
particle, but by two particles, which interact with each other by onsite $U$ and intersite $W_{1}$
and $W_{2}$ (nearest and next-nearest-neighbor, respectively) density-density interaction.
The investigated hamiltonian has a form of the extended Hubbard model in the atomic limit (i.e.,
the zero-bandwidth limit). In the analysis of the phase diagrams and thermodynamic properties
of this model with repulsive $W_{1}>0$, the variational approach is used, which treats the onsite
interaction term exactly and the intersite interactions within the mean-field approximation.
The ground state ($T=0$) diagram for $W_{2}\leq0$ as well as finite temperature ($T>0$) phase diagrams
for $W_{2}=0$ are presented. Two different types of charge order within $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$
unit cell can occur. At $T=0$, for $W_{2}=0$ phase separated states are degenerated with homogeneous
phases (but $T>0$ removes this degeneration), whereas attractive $W_2<0$ stabilizes phase separation
at incommensurate fillings. For $U/W_{1}<0$ and $U/W_{1}>1/2$ only the phase with two different
concentrations occurs (together with two different phase separated states occurring), whereas
for small repulsive $0<U/W_{1}<1/2$ the other ordered phase also appears (with tree different
concentrations in sublattices). The qualitative differences with the model considered on hypercubic
lattices are also discussed.

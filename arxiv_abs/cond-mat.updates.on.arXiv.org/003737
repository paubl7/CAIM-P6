The ability to control carrier concentration based on the extent of Cu solubility in the $\mathrm{Cu_{2x}Hg_{2-x}GeTe_4}$
alloy compound (where 0 $\leq$ x $\leq$ 1) makes $\mathrm{Cu_{2x}Hg_{2-x}GeTe_4}$ an interesting
case study in the field of thermoelectrics. While Cu clearly plays a role in this process, it is unknown
exactly how Cu incorporates into the $\mathrm{Cu_{2x}Hg_{2-x}GeTe_4}$ crystal structure and
how this affects the carrier concentration. In this work, we use a combination of resonant energy
X-ray diffraction (REXD) experiments and density functional theory (DFT) calculations to elucidate
the nature of Cu incorporation into the $\mathrm{Cu_{2x}Hg_{2-x}GeTe_4}$ structure. REXD across
the $\mathrm{Cu_k}$ edge facilitates the characterization of Cu incorporation in the $\mathrm{Cu_{2x}Hg_{2-x}GeTe_4}$
alloy and enables direct quantification of anti-site defects. We find that Cu substitutes for Hg
at a 2:1 ratio, wherein Cu annihilates a vacancy and swaps with a Hg atom. DFT calculations confirm
this result and further reveal that the incorporation of Cu occurs preferentially on one of the z
= 1/4 or z = 3/4 planes before filling the other plane. Furthermore, the amount of $\mathrm{Cu_{Hg}}$
anti-site defects quantified by REXD was found to be directly proportional to the experimentally
measured hole concentration, indicating that the $\mathrm{Cu_{Hg}}$ defects are the driving
force for tuning carrier concentration in the $\mathrm{Cu_{2x}Hg_{2-x}GeTe_4}$ alloy. The link
uncovered here between crystal structure, or more specifically anti-site defects, and carrier
concentration can be extended to similar cation-disordered material systems and will aid the development
of improved thermoelectric and other functional materials through defect engineering.

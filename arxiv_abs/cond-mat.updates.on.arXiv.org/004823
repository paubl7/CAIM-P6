In this thesis, we study chiral topological phases of 2+1 dimensional quantum matter. Such phases
are abstractly characterized by their non-vanishing chiral central charge $c$, a topological
invariant which appears as the coefficient of a gravitational Chern-Simons (gCS) action in bulk,
and of corresponding gravitational anomalies at boundaries. The chiral central charge is of particular
importance in chiral superfluids and superconductors (CSF/Cs), where $U(1)$ particle-number
symmetry is broken, and $c$ is, in some cases, the only topological invariant characterizing the
system. However, as opposed to invariants which can be probed by gauge fields in place of gravity,
the concrete physical implications of $c$ in the context of condensed matter physics is quite subtle,
and has been the subject of ongoing research and controversy. The first two parts of this thesis are
devoted to the physical interpretation of the gCS action and gravitational anomalies in the context
of CSF/Cs, where they are of particular importance, but have nevertheless remained poorly understood.
We then turn to a seemingly unrelated aspect of chiral topological phases - their computational
complexity. The infamous $sign\ problem$ leads to an exponential complexity in Monte Carlo simulations
of generic many-body quantum systems. Nevertheless, many phases of matter are known to admit a sign-problem-free
representative, allowing an efficient classical simulation. The possibility of $intrinsic$
sign problems, where a phase of matter admits no sign-problem-free representative, was recently
raised but remains largely unexplored. Here, we establish the existence of an intrinsic sign problem
in a broad class of chiral topological phases, both bosonic and fermionic, defined by the requirement
that $e^{2\pi i c/24}$ is $not$ the topological spin of an anyon.

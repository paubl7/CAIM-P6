Magnetic phenomena are ubiquitous in our surroundings and indispensable for modern science and
technology, but it is notoriously difficult to change the magnetic order of a material in a rapid
way. However, if a thin nickel film is subjected to ultrashort laser pulses, it can lose its magnetic
order almost completely within merely femtosecond times. This phenomenon, in the meantime also
observed in many other materials, has connected magnetism with femtosecond optics in an efficient,
ultrafast and complex way, offering opportunities for rapid information processing or ultrafast
spintronics at frequencies approaching those of light. Consequently, the physics of ultrafast
demagnetization is central to modern material research, but a crucial question has remained elusive:
If a material loses its magnetization within only femtoseconds, where is the missing angular momentum
in such short time? Here we use ultrafast electron diffraction to reveal in nickel an almost instantaneous,
long-lasting, non-equilibrium population of anisotropic high-frequency phonons that appear
as quickly as the magnetic order is lost. The anisotropy plane is perpendicular to the direction
of the initial magnetization and the atomic oscillation amplitude is 2 pm. We explain these observations
by means of circularly polarized phonons that quickly absorb the missing angular momentum of the
spin system before the slower onset of a macroscopic sample rotation. The time that is needed for
demagnetization is related to the time it takes to accelerate the atoms. These results provide an
atomistic picture of ultrafast demagnetization under adherence to all conservation laws but also
demonstrate the general importance of polarized phonons for non-equilibrium dynamics and provide
innovative ways for controlling materials on atomic dimensions.

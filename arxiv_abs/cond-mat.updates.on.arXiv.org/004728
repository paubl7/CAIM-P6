Modeling living systems at the collective scale can be very challenging because the individual
constituents can themselves be complex and the respective interactions between the constituents
are not fully understood. With the advent of high throughput experiments and in the age of big data,
data-driven methods are on the rise to overcome these challenges. To directly uncover the underlying
physical principles, we present a data-driven method for obtaining the phase-space density such
that the solution to the stochastic dynamic equation for active matter readily emerges, from which
time and space dependence of physical order parameters can be readily extracted. If the system is
near a steady state, we illuminate how to construct a field theory to subsequently make physical
predictions about the system. The method is first developed analytically and subsequently calibrated
using simulated data. The method is then applied to an experimental system of particles actively
driven by a {\it Serratia marcescens} bacterial swarm and in the presence of spatially localized
UV light. The analysis demonstrates that the particles are in the steady-state before and sometime
after the UV light and obey a Gaussian field theory with a spatially-varying "mass" in those regimes.
This novel, yet simple, finding is surprising given the complex dynamics of the bacterial swarm.
In response to the UV light, we demonstrate that there is a net flow of the particles away from the UV
light and that the entropy of the particles increases away from the light. We conclude with a discussion
of additional potential applications of our data-driven method such as when the internal structure
of the individual constituents dynamically changes to result in a modified stochastic dynamic
equation governing the system.

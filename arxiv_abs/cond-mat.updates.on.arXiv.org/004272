Cerium oxide (ceria, CeO2) is one of the most promising mixed ionic and electronic conducting materials.
Previous atomistic analysis has covered widely the effects of substitution on oxygen vacancy migration.
However, an in-depth analysis of the role of cation substitution beyond trivalent cations has rarely
been explored. Here, we investigate soluble monovalent, divalent, trivalent and tetravalent
cation substituents. By combining classical simulations and quantum mechanical calculations,
we provide an insight into defect association energies between substituent cations and oxygen
vacancies as well as their effects on the diffusion mechanisms. Our simulations indicate that oxygen
ionic diffusivity of subvalent cation-substituted systems follows the order Gd>Ca>Na. With the
same charge, a larger size mismatch with Ce cation yields a lower oxygen ionic diffusivity, i.e.,
Na>K, Ca>Ni, Gd>Al. Based on these trends, we identify species that could tune the oxygen ionic diffusivity:
we estimate that the optimum oxygen vacancy concentration for achieving fast oxygen ionic transport
is 2.5% for GdxCe1-xO2-x/2, CaxCe1-xO2-x and NaxCe1-xO2-3x/2 at 800 K. Remarkably, such a concentration
is not constant and shifts gradually to higher values as the temperature is increased. We find that
co-substitutions can enhance the impact of the single substitutions beyond that expected by their
simple addition. Furthermore, we identify preferential oxygen ion migration pathways, which
illustrate the electro-steric effects of substituent cations in determining the energy barrier
of oxygen ion migration. Such fundamental insights into the factors that govern the oxygen diffusion
coefficient and migration energy would enable design criteria to be defined for tuning the ionic
properties of the material, e.g., by co-doping.

Interacting many-body systems with explicitly accessible spatio-temporal correlation functions
are extremely rare, especially in the absence of integrability. Recently, we identified a remarkable
class of such systems and termed them dual-unitary quantum circuits. These are brick-wall type
local quantum circuits whose dynamics are unitary in both time and space. For these systems the spatio-temporal
correlation functions are non-trivial only at the edge of the causal light cone and can be computed
in terms of one-dimensional transfer matrices. Dual-unitarity, however, requires fine-tuning
and the degree of generality of the observed dynamical features remained unclear. Here we address
this question by introducing arbitrary perturbations of the local gates. Considering fixed perturbations,
we prove that for a particular class of unperturbed elementary dual-unitary gates the correlation
functions are still expressed in terms of one-dimensional transfer matrices. These matrices,
however, are now contracted over generic paths connecting the origin to a fixed endpoint inside
the causal light cone. The correlation function is given as a sum over all such paths. Our statement
is rigorous in the "dilute limit", where only a small fraction of the gates is perturbed, and in the
presence of random longitudinal fields, but we provide theoretical arguments and stringent numerical
checks supporting its validity even in the clean case and when all gates are perturbed. As a byproduct,
in the case of random longitudinal fields -- which turns out to be equivalent to certain classical
Markov chains -- we find four types of non-dual-unitary(and non-integrable) interacting many-body
systems where the correlation functions are exactly given by the path-sum formula.

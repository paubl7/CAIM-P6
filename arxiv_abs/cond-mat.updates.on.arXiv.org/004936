Ventricular fibrillation (VF) is a lifethreatening electromechanical dysfunction of the heart
associated with complex spatiotemporal dynamics of electrical excitation and mechanical contraction
of the heart muscle. It has been hypothesized that VF is driven by three-dimensional (3D) rotating
electrical scroll waves, which can be characterized by filament-like electrical phase singularities
(EPS). Recently, it was shown that rotating excitation waves during VF are associated with rotating
waves of mechanical deformation. 3D mechanical scroll waves and mechanical filaments describing
their rotational core were observed in the ventricles by using high-resolution ultrasound. The
findings suggest that the spatiotemporal organization of cardiac fibrillation may be assessed
from waves of mechanical deformation. However, the complex relationship between excitation and
mechanical waves during VF is currently not understood. Here, we study the fundamental nature of
mechanical phase singularities (MPS), their spatiotemporal organization and relation with EPS.
We demonstrate the existence of two fundamental types of MPS: "paired singularities", which are
co-localized with EPS, and "unpaired singularities", which can form independently. We show that
the unpaired singularities emerge due to the anisotropy of the active force field, generated by
fiber anisotropy in cardiac tissue, and the non-locality of elastic interactions, which jointly
induce strong spatiotemporal inhomogeneities in the strain fields. The inhomogeneities lead
to the breakup of deformation waves and create MPS, even in the absence of EPS, which are typically
associated with excitation wave break. We exploit these insights to develop an approach to discriminate
paired and unpaired MPS. Our findings provide a fundamental understanding of the complex spatiotemporal
organization of electromechanical waves in the heart.

Jamming is a phenomenon shared by a wide variety of systems, such as granular materials, foams, and
glasses in their high density regime. This has motivated the development of a theoretical framework
capable of explaining many of their static critical properties with a unified approach. However
the dynamics occurring in the vicinity of the jamming point has received little attention and the
problem of finding a connection with the local structure of the configuration remains unexplored.
Here we address this issue by constructing physically well defined structural variables using
the information contained in the network of contacts of jammed configurations, and then showing
that such variables yield a resilient statistical description of the particle-wise dynamics near
this critical point. Our results are based on extensive numerical simulations of systems of spherical
particles that allow us to statistically characterize the trajectories of individual particles
in terms of their first two moments. We first demonstrate that, besides displaying a broad distribution
of mobilities, particles may also have preferential directions of motion. Next, we associate each
of these features with a structural variable computed uniquely in terms of the contact vectors at
jamming, obtaining considerably high statistical correlations. The robustness of our approach
is confirmed by testing two types of dynamical protocols, namely Molecular Dynamics and Monte Carlo,
with different types of interaction. We also provide evidence that the dynamical regime we study
here is dominated by anharmonic effects and therefore it cannot be described properly in terms of
vibrational modes. Finally, we show that correlations decay slowly and in an interaction-independent
fashion, suggesting a universal rate of information loss.

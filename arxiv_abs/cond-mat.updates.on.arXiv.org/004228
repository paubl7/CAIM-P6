Large area van der Waals (vdW) thin films are assembled materials consisting of a network of randomly
stacked nanosheets. The multi-scale structure and the two-dimensional nature of the building
block mean that interfaces naturally play a crucial role in the charge transport of such thin films.
While single or few stacked nanosheets (i.e. vdW heterostructures) have been the subject of intensive
works, little is known about how charges travel through multilayered, more disordered networks.
Here we report a comprehensive study of a prototypical system given by networks of randomly stacked
reduced graphene oxide 2D nanosheets, whose chemical and geometrical properties can be controlled
independently, permitting to explore percolated networks ranging from a single nanosheet to some
billions with room temperature resistivity spanning from 10-5 to 10-1 ohm m. We systematically
observe a clear transition between two different regimes at a critical temperature T*: Efros-Shklovskii
variable range hopping (ESVRH) below T* and power law (PL) behavior above. Firstly, we demonstrate
that the two regimes are strongly correlated with each other, both depending on the charge localization
length xi, calculated by ES-VRH model, which corresponds to the characteristic size of overlapping
sp2 domains belonging to different nanosheets. Thus, we propose a microscopic model describing
the charge transport as a geometrical phase transition, given by the metal-insulator transition
associated with the percolation of quasi-1D nanofillers with length xi, showing that the charge
transport behavior of the networks is valid for all geometries and defects of the nanosheets, ultimately
suggesting a generalized description on vdW and disordered thin films.

While memory effects emerge from systems of wildly varying length- and time-scales, the reduction
of a complex system with many interacting elements into one simple enough to be understood without
also losing the complex behavior continues to be a challenge. Here, we investigate how bistable
cylindrical origamis provide such a reduction via tunably-interactive memory behaviors. We base
our investigation on folded sheets of Kresling patterns that function as two-state memory units.
By linking several units, each with a selected activation energy, we construct a one-dimensional
material that exhibits return-point memory. After a comprehensive experimental analysis of the
relation between the geometry of the pattern and the mechanical response for a single bit, we study
the memory of a bellows composed of 4 bits arranged in series. When these bits are decoupled, the system
reduces to the Preisach model and we can drive the bellows to any of its 16 allowable states by following
a prescribed sequence of compression and extension. Moreover, we show how to reasonably discriminate
between states by measuring the system's total height and stiffness near equilibrium. In bellows
with coupled bits, the interactions alter the energy landscape and enable geometrically-disallowed
defective stable configurations; this produces a 64-state configuration space with a more complex
transition pattern. Using empirical considerations of the mechanics, we analyze the hierarchical
structure of the corresponding diagram, which includes Garden of Eden states and subgraphs. We
highlight two irreversible transformations, shifting and erasure of the defect, leading to memory
behaviors reminiscent of those observed with more complex glassy systems.

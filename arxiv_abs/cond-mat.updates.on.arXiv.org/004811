Grain boundaries (GBs) are planar lattice defects that govern the properties of many types of polycrystalline
materials. Hence, their structures have been investigated in great detail. However, much less
is known about their chemical features, owing to the experimental difficulties to probe these features
at the atomic length scale inside bulk material specimens. Atom probe tomography (APT) is a tool
capable of accomplishing this task, with an ability to quantify chemical characteristics at near-atomic
scale. Using APT data sets, we present here a machine-learning-based approach for the automated
quantification of chemical features of GBs. We trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) using
twenty thousand synthesized images of grain interiors, GBs, or triple junctions. Such a trained
CNN automatically detects the locations of GBs from APT data. Those GBs are then subjected to compositional
mapping and analysis, including revealing their in-plane chemical decoration patterns. We applied
this approach to experimentally obtained APT data sets pertaining to three case studies, namely,
Ni-P, Pt-Au, and Al-Zn-Mg-Cu alloys. In the first case, we extracted GB-specific segregation features
as a function of misorientation and coincidence site lattice character. Secondly, we revealed
interfacial excesses and in-plane chemical features that could not have been found by standard
compositional analyses. Lastly, we tracked the temporal evolution of chemical decoration from
early-stage solute GB segregation in the dilute limit to interfacial phase separation, characterized
by the evolution of complex composition patterns. This machine-learning-based approach provides
quantitative, unbiased, and automated access to GB chemical analyses, serving as an enabling tool
for new discoveries related to interface thermodynamics, kinetics, and the associated chemistry-structure-property
relations.

Recently, chalcogenide glass based phase change materials (PCMs) have shown utility as a tuning
material for a range of nanophotonic devices. Owing to their low loss, ultrafast switching speeds
and wide waveband operation, PCMs are integrated in an increasing number of next generation tunable
components, including integrated photonic switches, metasurface optics and tunable spectral
filters. Nonetheless, modelling of PCM-based devices is challenging, both in terms of accurate
representation of experimentally-derived material properties in different phase states, and
standardization of results across the research community. In this work, we introduce PCMnet, an
online database of the complex refractive indices of a variety of chalcogenide glass PCMs (such
as GeSbTe), as an accessible and indexed repository for data sharing across the PCM community. Refractive
indices (n) and extinction coefficients (k) between amorphous and crystalline states are directly
extracted from experimentally-derived data in numerous academic research articles, and collated
into the material resource database. Due to the inaccuracies associated with our data collection
methods, this data is supplemented with additional computationally-generated data, obtained
through WVASE, a commercial ellipsometry analysis software package. To demonstrate the utility
of PCMnet, we provide a NASA application-driven device optimization example using the optical
properties of PCMs collected with our database. We anticipate the database providing great use
to the PCM community and coordinated research efforts enabled by PCMnet will promote the shared
repository for the selection of appropriate PCMs for tunable nanophotonic device design for a range
of applications.

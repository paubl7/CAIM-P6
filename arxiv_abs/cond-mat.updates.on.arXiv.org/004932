The two-dimensional (2d) Ising model is the statistical physics textbook example for phase transitions
and their kinetics. Quenched through the Curie point with Glauber rates, the late-time description
of the ferromagnetic domain coarsening finds its place at the scalar sector of the Allen-Cahn (Model
A) class. Resisting exact results sought since Lifshitz's account in 1962, the central quantities
in 2d Model A $-$ most scaling exponents and correlation functions $-$ remain known up to approximate
theories whose disparate outcomes urge experimental confrontation. Here, we report a comprehensive
study on the coarsening of 2d twisted nematic liquid crystals whose kinetics is induced by a super-fast
electrical switching from a spatiotemporally chaotic state to a two-phase concurrent, equilibrium
one. Tracking the dynamics via optical microscopy, we firstly show sharp evidence of well-established
Model A aspects, such as the dynamic exponent $z=2$ and the dynamic scaling hypothesis, to then move
forward and: $i)$ confirm the Bray-Humayun theory for the Porod's regime of spatial correlators;
$ii)$ show that their nontrivial decay beyond the Porod's regime is captured by Gaussian-based
models; $iii)$ corroborate the aging hypothesis for Model A, which includes the collapse of two-time
correlators into a master curve that is $iv)$ best accounted for by a solution of the local scaling
invariance theory: the same solution that fits the 2d nonconserved Ising model (2dIM) data along
with the Fisher-Huse conjecture. We also $v)$ suggest the true value for the local persistence exponent,
in disfavour of the exact value for the diffusion equation. Finally, we $vi)$ extract a universal
fractal dimension for the morphology of persistence clusters. Due to its accuracy and possibilities,
this experimental setup may work as a prototype to address universality issues in the realm of nonequilibrium
systems.

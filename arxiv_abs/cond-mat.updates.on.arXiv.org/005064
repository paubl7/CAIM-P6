On a capital market the social group is formed from traders. Individual behaviour of agents is influenced
by the need to associate with other agents and to obtain the approval of other agents in the group.
Making decisions an individual equates own needs with those of the other agents. Any two agents from
the group may interact. The interaction consists of the exchange of information and it costs some
money. We assume that agents give reference to the origin of the information if asked by other agents.
Thus the agent may verify obtained private information. Hudak recently used methods described
by Rivier to study social behaviour of such agents. He characterized the quantity which corresponds
to verification of information. Quantity which characterizes verification of information contributes
to an aversion of an agent with respect to a risk. The mix of investments of an agent in a given cell with
an average measure A of risk aversion in the cell is found from minimum of the average per cell aim function
$<FM>$. Absolute minimum corresponds to such a state in which there is an optimal mix of the exchange
of information for a given expectations about the capital market. The crowd and personal /$\approx
<f>$/ contributions to the risk aversion of an agent are present in the aversion constant A. We have
discussed a stable and metastable states of the market for different values of E, an expected return
for a given investment period, of EV, an expected risk for a given investment period, and of b, a constant
which characterizes contribution of the quantity $<f>$ to the risk aversion. Variance of n for the
distribution of nonreducibile subgroups is found. Our model describes intermediary process effects.

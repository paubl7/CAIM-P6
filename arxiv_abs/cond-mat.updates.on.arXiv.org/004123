We investigate the role of higher-form symmetries and two kinds of 't Hooft anomalies in non-equilibrium
systems. To aid our investigation, we extend the coset construction to account for $p$-form symmetries
at zero and finite temperature. One kind of anomaly arises when a $p$-form symmetry is spontaneously
broken: in a $d+1$-dimensional spacetime there often exists an emergent $d-p-1$-form symmetry
with mixed 't Hooft anomaly. That is, the $p$-form and $d-p-1$-form symmetries cannot be gauged
simultaneously. At the level of the coset construction, this mixed anomaly prevents the Goldstones
for the $p$- and $d-p-1$-form symmetries from appearing in the same Maurer-Cartan form. As a result,
whenever such a mixed anomaly exists, we find the emergence of dual theories -- one involving the
$p$-form Goldstone and the other involving the $d-p-1$-form Goldstone -- that are related to each
other by a kind of Legendre transform. Such an anomaly can exist at zero and finite temperature. The
other kind of 't Hooft anomaly can only arise in non-equilibrium systems; we therefore term it the
non-equilibrium 't Hoof anomaly. In this case, an exact symmetry of the non-equilibrium effective
action fails to have a non-trivial, conserved Noether current. This anomalous behavior arises
when a global symmetry cannot be gauged in the non-equilibrium effective action and can arise in
both open and closed systems. We construct actions for a number of systems including chemically
reacting fluids, Yang-Mills theory, Chern-Simons theory, magnetohydrodynamic systems, and
dual superfluid and solid theories. Finally, we find that the interplay of these two kinds of anomalies
has a surprising result: in non-equilibrium systems, whether or not a symmetry appears spontaneously
broken can depend on the time-scale over which the system is observed.

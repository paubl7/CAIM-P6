Domains are homogeneous areas of discrete symmetry, created in nonequilibrium phase transitions.
They are separated by domain walls, topological objects which prevent them from fusing together.
Domains may reconfigure by thermally-driven microscopic processes, and in quantum systems, by
macroscopic quantum tunnelling. The underlying microscopic physics that defines the system's
energy landscape for tunnelling is of interest in many different systems, from cosmology and other
quantum domain systems, and more generally to nuclear physics, matter waves, magnetism, and biology.
A unique opportunity to investigate the dynamics of microscopic correlations leading to emergent
behaviour, such as quantum domain dynamics is offered by quantum materials. Here, as a direct realization
of Feynman's idea of using a quantum computer to simulate a quantum system, we report an investigation
of quantum electron reconfiguration dynamics and domain melting in two matching embodiments:
a prototypical two-dimensionally electronically ordered solid-state quantum material and a
simulation on a latest-generation quantum simulator. We use scanning tunnelling microscopy to
measure the time-evolution of electronic domain reconfiguration dynamics and compare this with
the time evolution of domains in an ensemble of entangled correlated electrons in simulated quantum
domain melting. The domain reconfiguration is found to proceed by tunnelling in an emergent, self-configuring
energy landscape, with characteristic step-like time evolution and temperature-dependences
observed macroscopically. The remarkable correspondence in the dynamics of a quantum material
and a quantum simulation opens the way to an understanding of emergent behaviour in diverse interacting
many-body quantum systems at the microscopic level.

In this paper, we show that a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) exists at late times in open quantum
systems with weak nonlinearity by following its nonequilibrium dynamics with a perturbative analysis.
Here we consider an oscillator chain containing three-types of anharmonicity in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou
(FPUT) model: cubic $\alpha$- and quartic $\beta$-type nearest-oscillator interactions and
the on-site (pinned) Klein-Gordon (KG) quartic self-interaction. Assuming weak nonlinearity,
we introduce a stochastic influence action approach to the problem and obtain the energy flow in
different junctures of the chain. The formal results obtained here can be used for quantum transport
problems in weakly nonlinear quantum systems. For $\alpha$-type anharmonicity, we observe that
the first-order corrections do not play any role in the thermal transport in the NESS of the configuration
we considered. For KG and $\beta$-types anharmonicity, we work out explicitly the case of two weakly
nonlinearly coupled oscillators, with results scalable to any number of oscillators. We examine
the late-time energy flows from one thermal bath to the other via the coupled oscillators, and show
that both the zeroth- and the first-order contributions of the energy flow become constant in time
at late times, signaling the existence of a late-time NESS to first order in nonlinearity. Our perturbative
calculations provide a measure of the strength of nonlinearity for nonlinear open quantum systems,
which may help control the mesoscopic heat transport distinct from or close to linear transport.
Furthermore, our results also give a benchmark for the numerical challenge of simulating heat transport.
Our setup and predictions can be implemented and verified by investigating heat flow in an array
of Josephson junctions in the limit of large Josephson energy with the platform of circuit QED.

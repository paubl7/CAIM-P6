Solar energy is clean and renewable but has a low flux density. The lack of a continuous and reliable
power supply reduces their average daily output. Since the infrared part is not utilized to produce
electricity, conventional photovoltaic cells use only about half of the solar spectrum. Direct
radiation flux is also necessary for solar Stirling engine to work efficiently. The hybrid system
can largely overcome these problems. The design combines the photovoltaic and energy storage-integrated
Stirling engine or thermal field emission technologies in the same concentrating solar power system,
providing a great potential in terms of energy production per unit area. The photovoltaic cells
can be deposited on the concentrating solar power main mirror to allow the system to collect and convert
the diffuse component of the light. The design allows utilization of existing equipment, particularly
a high-grade parabolic dish or midgrade Fresnel concentrator for rooftop installation. To optimize
the use of solar energy, beam splitters thermally decouple the modules by splitting the solar spectrum
into three spectral ranges and directing visible, ultraviolet and infrared radiation into the
photovoltaic cells, gate/Cs-filled gap and cavity-type solar receiver, respectively. A photon-enhanced
gate electrode creates on the cathode surface an electrostatic field large enough to compensate
space charge field and initiates thermal field emission process. In the thermal field emission
cathodes with nano-structured surfaces, the current density can reach values close to the field
emission limit. The design of the electrodes based on nano-structured emission materials were
experimentally explored by the co-authors. In these experiments, efficiency of heat-to-electricity
conversion was investigated and conditions for advanced nano-materials application for harvesting
solar energy were found.

Reentrance, the return of a system from an ordered phase to a previously encountered less-ordered
one as a controlled parameter is continuously varied, is a recurring theme found in disparate physical
systems, from condensed matter to black holes. While diverse in its many incarnations and generally
unsuspected, the cause of reentrance at the microscopic level is often not investigated thoroughly.
Here, through detailed characterization and theoretical modeling, we uncover the microscopic
mechanism behind reentrance in the strongly frustrated pyrochlore antiferromagnet Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$.
Taking advantage of the recent advance in rare earth stannate single crystal synthesis, we use heat
capacity measurements to expose that Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ exhibits multiple instances of reentrance
in its magnetic field $B$ vs. temperature $T$ phase diagram for magnetic fields along three cubic
high symmetry directions. Through classical Monte Carlo simulations, mean field theory and classical
linear spin-wave expansions, we argue that the origins of the multiple occurrences of reentrance
observed in Er$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ are linked to soft modes. Depending on the field direction, these
arise either from a direct $T=0$ competition between the field-evolved ground states, or from a
field-induced enhancement of the competition with a distinct zero-field antiferromagnetic phase.
In both scenarios, the phase competition enhances thermal fluctuations which entropically stabilize
a specific ordered phase. This results in an increased transition temperature for certain field
values and thus the reentrant behavior. Our work represents a detailed examination into the mechanisms
responsible for reentrance in a frustrated magnet and may serve as a template for the interpretation
of reentrant phenomena in other physical systems.

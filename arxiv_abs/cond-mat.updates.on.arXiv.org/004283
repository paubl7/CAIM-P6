In this paper, the Fe-20Ni-25Cr alloy that is used for fuel cladding or pressure vessels with various
grain boundaries (GBs) was investigated by employing molecular dynamics simulations. The bi-crystals
comprised of {\Sigma}3(111), {\Sigma}3(112), {\Sigma}9(114), {\Sigma}11(113), {\Sigma}19(116),
and {\Sigma}17(223) types GBs were considered to systematically examine the interplay between
irradiation defects, irradiation microstructure evolution under stress, and irradiation mechanical
properties with irradiation intensity, coincidence site lattice parameter, tilt angle, and GB
thickness. It is found that irradiated vacancies and interstitials are annihilated by competitive
GB absorption and recombination. Bias absorption of interstitials is observed for most bi-crystals
except {\Sigma}3(111) and {\Sigma}11(113) at 15 keV incident energy, and results in abundant residual
vacancies clusters in grain interior. In addition, different GBs exhibit quite diverse irradiation
defect sink ability, and the number of residual vacancies is inversely related to the GB thickness,
where {\Sigma}3(111) and {\Sigma}11(113) GBs with narrow GB thickness are weak in defect absorption
and the others are strong. Furthermore, uniaxial tensile simulations perpendicular to the GB reveal
that all of the mechanical performance of bi-crystals deteriorates after irradiation, which originates
from dislocation propagation facilitated by irradiation defect clusters. In particular, regardless
of whether the irradiation is applied, the maximum tensile strain, toughness, and Youngs modulus
are monotonically correlated with GB tilt angle, while the ultimate tensile strength is stable
for larger GB CSL parameter. Finally, on the basis of the evolution of the irradiation defects, microstructures,
and mechanical performances, we proposed guidelines of rational design of irradiation-resistant
Fe-Ni-Cr alloy.

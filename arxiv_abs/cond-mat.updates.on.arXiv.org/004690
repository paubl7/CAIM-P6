Through its dependence on low symmetry crystal phases, ferroelectricity is inherently a property
tied to the lower temperature ranges of the phase diagram for a given material. This paper presents
conclusive evidence that in the case of ferroelectric AlScN, low temperature has to be seen as a purely
relative term, since its ferroelectric-to-paraelectric transition temperature is confirmed
to surpass 1100{\deg}C and thus the transition temperature of virtually any other thin film ferroelectric.
We arrived at this conclusion through investigating the structural stability of 0.4 - 2 ${\mu}$m
thick Al$_{0.73}$Sc$_{0.27}$N films grown on Mo bottom electrodes via in situ high-temperature
X-ray diffraction and permittivity measurements. Our studies reveal the wurtzite-type structure
of Al$_{0.73}$Sc$_{0.27}$N is conserved during the entire 1100{\deg}C annealing cycle, apparent
through a constant c over a lattice parameter ratio. In situ permittivity measurements performed
up to 1000{\deg}C strongly support this conclusion and include what could be the onset of a diverging
permittivity only at the very upper end of the measurement interval. Our in situ measurements are
well-supported by ex situ (scanning) transmission electron microscopy and polarization and capacity
hysteresis measurements. These results confirm the structural stability on the sub-${\mu}$m
scale next to the stability of the inscribed polarization during the complete 1100{\deg}C annealing
treatment. Thus, AlScN is the first readily available thin film ferroelectric with a temperature
stability that surpasses virtually all thermal budgets occurring in microtechnology, be it during
fabrication or the lifetime of a device - even in harshest environments.

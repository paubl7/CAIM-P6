We present here the transmission of electromagnetic waves through layered structures of metallic
and left-handed media. Based on the theory of finite periodic systems, we show that besides the strong
influence of the incidence angle, the low transmission characteristic of a single conductor slab,
for frequencies $\omega$ below the plasma frequency $\omega_p$, becomes in this domain highly
oscillating. Similarly, the well-established transmission coefficient of a single left-handed
slab becomes highly resonant with superluminal effects in superlattices with more than one unit
cell. We determine the space-time evolution of a wave packet through the $\lambda/4$ photonic superlattice
whose transmission coefficient is a sequence of isolated and equidistant peaks with negative phase
times. We show that the space-time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, with centroid at any of these
peaks, agrees with the theoretical predictions, and no violation of the causality principle occurs.
We show that besides the strong influence of the incidence angle, the coherent coupling of the bulk
plasmon modes and the interface surface plasmon polaritons lead to oscillating transmission coefficients,
and depending on the parity of the number of unit cells $n$ of the superlattice, the transmission
vanishes or amplifies as the conductor width increases. We determine the space-time evolution
of a wave packet through the $\lambda/4$ photonic superlattice whose bandwidth becomes negligible,
and the transmission coefficient becomes a sequence of isolated and equidistant peaks with negative
phase times. We show that the space-time evolution of a Gaussian wave packet, with the centroid at
any of these peaks, agrees with the theoretical predictions, and no violation of the causality principle
occurs.

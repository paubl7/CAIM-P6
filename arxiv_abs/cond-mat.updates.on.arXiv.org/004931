Understanding the mechanisms of plasticity in structural steels is essential for the operation
of next-generation fusion reactors. Elemental composition, particularly the amount of Cr present,
and irradiation can have separate and synergistic effects on the mechanical properties of ferritic/martensitic
steels. The study of ion-irradiated FeCr alloys is useful for gaining a mechanistic understanding
of irradiation damage in steels. Previous studies of ion-irradiated FeCr did not clearly distinguish
between the nucleation of dislocations to initiate plasticity, and their propagation through
the material as plasticity progresses. In this study, Fe3Cr, Fe5Cr, and Fe10Cr were irradiated
with 20 MeV Fe$^{3+}$ ions at room temperature to nominal doses of 0.01 dpa and 0.1 dpa. Nanoindentation
was carried out with Berkovich and spherical indenter tips to study the nucleation of dislocations
and their subsequent propagation. The presence of irradiation-induced defects reduced the theoretical
shear stress and barrier for dislocation nucleation. The presence of Cr further enhanced this effect
due to increased retention of irradiation defects. However, this combined effect is still small
compared to dislocation nucleation from pre-existing sources such as Frank-Read sources and grain
boundaries. The yield strength, an indicator of dislocation mobility, of FeCr increased with irradiation
damage and Cr. The increased retention of irradiation defects due to the presence of Cr also further
increased the yield strength. Reduced work hardening capacity was also observed following irradiation.
The synergistic effects of Cr and irradiation damage in FeCr appear to be more important for the propagation
of dislocations, rather than their nucleation.

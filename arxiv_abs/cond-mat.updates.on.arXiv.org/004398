We address an outstanding problem that represents a critical roadblock in the development of the
Majorana-based topological qubit using semiconductor-superconductor hybrid structures: the
quantitative characterization of disorder effects generated by the unintentional presence of
charge impurities within the hybrid device. Given that disorder can have far-reaching consequences
for the Majorana physics, but is intrinsically difficult to probe experimentally in a hybrid structure,
providing a quantitative theoretical description of disorder effects becomes essential. To accomplish
this task, we develop a microscopic theory that (i) provides a quantitative characterization of
the effective potential generated by a charge impurity embedded inside a semiconductor wire proximity-coupled
to a superconductor layer by solving self-consistently the associated three-dimensional Schr\"odinger-Poisson
problem, (ii) describes the low-energy physics of the hybrid structure in the presence of s-wave
superconductivity, spin-orbit coupling, Zeeman splitting, and disorder arising from multiple
charge impurities by using the results of (i) within a standard free fermion approach, and (iii)
links the microscopic results to experimentally observable features by generating tunneling
differential conductance maps as function of the control parameters (e.g., Zeeman field and chemical
potential). We find that charge impurities lead to serious complications regarding the realization
and observation of Majorana zero modes, which have direct implications for the development of Majorana-based
qubits. More importantly, our work provides a clear direction regarding what needs to be done for
progress in the field, including specific materials quality and semiconductor purity targets
that must be achieved to create a topological qubit.

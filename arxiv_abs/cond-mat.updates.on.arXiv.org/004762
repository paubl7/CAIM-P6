We study the hybrid atoms-cell site entanglement in one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH)
topological insulator with first, second neighbor-hopping interaction and intra-cell modulation,
in space representation of finite chains. We determine the geometric phases by the Resta electric
polarization and the entanglement in the atomic basis by the Schmidt number as metric of the degree
of non-classicity, the maximally entangled quantum states are characterized by the inverse participation
ratio IPR. A relation between entanglement and the topological phase transitions (TPT) are found,
since the Schmidt number presented critical points of maximally entangled (ME) states just in the
singularities of the change of the winding number for the nearest states to the zero mode energy and
shifted for higher energy state.We present the general conditions that has to be satisfy to produce
a ME hybrid Bell states. We obtain that the states with second neighbors, with two phases, shows a
higher degree of entanglement than the first order hopping. We obtain parameter conditions with
broad regions for non null topological phases that can have maximum entanglement. We find a robust
relation between entanglement and the inverse participation ratio (IPR) for the the eigenstates
with ME which are associated to maximum delocalization in both models. The amplitude distribution
for each atom are spatially localized in cell site showing a bunching in cell sets. The intra-cell
modulation provides a better connection between entanglement and electric polarization with
a periodical driven period. The study of topological properties through entanglement is an complementary
tool for determining macroscopic properties and analyzing more complex systems with many-body
particles or higher dimensions.

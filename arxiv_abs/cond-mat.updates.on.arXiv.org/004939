scillatory shear tests are widely used in rheology to characterize the linear and non-linear mechanical
response of complex fluids, including the yielding transition. There is an increasing urge to acquire
detailed knowledge of the deformation field that is effectively present across the sample during
these tests; at the same time, there is mounting evidence that the macroscopic rheological response
depends on the elusive microscopic behavior of the material constituents. Here we employ a strain-controlled
shear-cell with transparent walls to visualize and quantify the dynamics of tracers embedded in
various cyclically sheared complex fluids, ranging from almost-ideal elastic to yield stress
fluids. For each sample, we use image correlation processing to measure the macroscopic deformation
field, and echo-Differential Dynamic Microscopy to probe the microscopic irreversible sample
dynamics in reciprocal space; finally, we devise a simple scheme to spatially map the rearrangements
in the sheared sample, once again without tracking the tracers. For the yield stress sample, we obtain
a wave-vector dependent characterization of shear-induced diffusion across the yielding transition,
which is accompanied by a three-order-of-magnitude speed-up of the dynamics and by a transition
from localized, intermittent rearrangements to a more spatially homogeneous and temporally uniform
activity. Our tracking free approach is intrinsically multi-scale, can successfully discriminate
between different types of dynamics, and can be automated to minimize user intervention. Applications
are many, as it can be translated to other imaging modes, including fluorescence, and can be used
with sub-resolution tracers and even without tracers, for samples that provide intrinsic optical
contrast.

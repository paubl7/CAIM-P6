One of the most celebrated contributions to the study of the mechanical behavior of materials is
due to J.D. Eshelby, who in the late 50s revolutionized our understanding of the elastic stress and
strain fields due to an ellipsoidal inclusion/inhomogeneity that undergoes a transformation
of shape and size. While Eshelby's work laid the foundation for significant advancements in various
fields, including fracture mechanics, theory of phase transitions, and homogenization methods,
its extension into the range of large deformations, and to situations in which the material can actively
reorganize in response to the finite transformation strain, is in a nascent state. Beyond the theoretical
difficulties imposed by highly nonlinear material response, a major hindrance has been the absence
of experimental observations that can elucidate the intricacies that arise in this regime. To address
this limitation, our experimental observations reveal the key morphogenesis steps of Vibrio cholerae
biofilms embedded in hydrogels, as they grow by four orders of magnitude from their initial size.
Using the biofilm growth as a case study, our theoretical model considers various growth scenarios
and employs two different and complimentary methods to obtain equilibrium solutions. A particular
emphasis is put on determining the natural growth path of an inclusion that optimizes its shape in
response to the confinement, and the onset of damage in the matrix, which together explain the observed
behavior of biofilms. Beyond bacterial biofilms, this work sheds light on the role of mechanics
in determining the morphogenesis pathways of confined growing bodies and thus applies to a broad
range of phenomena that are ubiquitous in both natural and engineered material systems.

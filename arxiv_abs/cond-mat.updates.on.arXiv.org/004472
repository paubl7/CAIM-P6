The surface orientation dependence on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) performance of topological
crystalline insulator (TCI) SnTe thin films was studied. Their intrinsic electrochemical activities
were determined by the linear sweep voltammetry and cyclic voltammetry measurements, in which
the obtained electrochemical surface areas agree well with their surface topology as revealed
by atomic force microscopy image analysis. It was found that the SnTe (001) and (111) surfaces exhibit
superior intrinsic activities over those of various topological quantum and nanostructured materials
such as the Pt-group-metal-based chiral crystals, while the (211) surface shows uncompetitive
activity. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that while pure (001) and (111) are
not good electrocatalysts, the SnTe thin film with Sn vacancies or partially oxidized surfaces,
with the latter as evidenced by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis, have high HER activity.
The theoretical calculations show that the overall performance of the (001) and (111) surfaces
with topological surface states (TSSs) is better than that of the (211) surface without TSSs, which
is further confirmed by the weak antilocalization effect in magneto-transport measurements.
We have also addressed the effect of possible surface facets and the contrast of the HER activity
of the available active sites among the three samples. The high HER activity of SnTe (001) and (111)
is attributed to the enhanced charge transfer between hydrogen atoms and the TSSs. The absence or
fragility of TSSs in the lowly symmetric SnTe (211) explains its relatively low HER performance.
Our study offers a direction to design cost-effective electrocatalysts by tuning the TSSs and mirror
symmetry of TCIs.

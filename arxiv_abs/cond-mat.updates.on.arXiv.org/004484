Supercapacitors, S-C - capacitors that take advantage of the large capacitance at the interface
between an electrode and an electrolyte - have found many short-term energy applications. We concentrate
here on optically induced, electrical and thermal effects. The parallel plate cells were made of
two transparent electrodes (ITO), each covered with semiconductor-embedded, active carbon (A-C)
layer. While A-C appears black, it is not an ideal blackbody absorber that absorbs all spectral light
indiscriminately. In addition to relatively flat optical absorption background, A-C exhibits
two distinct absorption bands: in the near-IR and in the blue. The first may be attributed to absorption
by OH- group and the latter, by scattering, possibly by surface plasmons. Here, optical and thermal
effects of sub-micron size SiC particles that are embedded in A-C electrode, are presented. Similarly
to nano-Si particles, SiC exhibits blue band absorption, but it is less likely to oxidize. Using
Charge-Discharge (CD) experiments, the relative optically related capacitance increase may
be as large as ~34% (68% when the illuminated area is taken into account). Capacitance increase was
noted as the illuminated samples became hotter. This thermal effect amounts to 20% of the overall
relative change using CD experiments. The thermal effect was quite large when the SiC particles
were replaced by CdSe/ZnS quatum dots; for the latter, the thermal effect was 35% compared with 10%
for the optical effect. When analyzing the optical effect one may consider two processes: ionization
of the semiconductor particles and charge displacement under the cell's terminals - a dipole effect.
Our model suggests that the capacitance increase is related to an optically induced dipole.

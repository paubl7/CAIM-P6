Superconductor electronics fabrication technology developed at MIT Lincoln Laboratory enables
the development of VLSI digital circuits with millions of Josephson junctions per square centimeter.
However, conventional DC and multi-phase AC biasing techniques already encounter serious challenges
for scaling circuits above several hundred thousand junctions. In this work, we propose a novel
AC-based biasing scheme for RSFQ-type logic families requiring DC bias. The major step toward this
scheme is a superconducting AC/DC rectifier which we introduced at ASC 2014. Initially, we proposed
to connect the rectifiers to 'payload cells' via superconducting inductors with large inductance
in order to reduce parasitic effects of flux quantization. Recently, we discovered that this powering
scheme works even better at a much lower value of the inductance, when it is just sufficient to hold
only one or two flux quanta in the inductive loop between the converter and the payload. In this case,
flux quantization in the loop becomes beneficial because the value of current fed into the payload
is defined by the value of the coupling inductance. Therefore, our AC/SFQ converter powers the payload
cell by a single flux quantum rather than by DC current. Such mode of operation is extremely energy
efficient because the energy is used only to recover flux quantum consumed by the cell during the
logic operation. We present designs of AC/SFQ converters comprising an AC/DC rectifier and a current
conditioning circuit which we termed an SFQ filter. We also present test results and demonstrate
AC/SFQ powering a payload circuit using circuits fabricated in a new, 150-nm node of Lincoln Laboratory
fabrication technology using self-shunted Nb/AlOx-Al/Nb Josephson junctions with 600 $\mu$A/$\mu$$m^2$
critical current density and 200 nm minimum linewidth of inductors.

Many phenomena in the climate system lie in the gray zone between weather and climate: they are not
amenable to deterministic forecast, but they still depend on the initial condition. A natural example
is medium-range forecasting, which is inherently probabilistic because it lies beyond the deterministic
predictability time of the atmosphere, but for which statistically significant prediction can
be made which depend on the current state of the system. Similarly, one may ask the probability of
occurrence of an El Ni\~no event several months ahead of time. In this paper, we introduce a quantity
which corresponds precisely to this type of prediction problem: the committor function is the probability
that an event takes place within a given time window, as a function of the initial condition. We explain
the main mathematical properties of this probabilistic concept, and compute it in the case of a low-dimensional
stochastic model for El-Ni\~no, the Jin and Timmerman model. In this context, we show that the ability
to predict the probability of occurrence of the event of interest may differ strongly depending
on the initial state. The main result is the new distinction between intrinsic probabilistic predictability
(when the committor function is smooth and probability can be computed which does not depend sensitively
on the initial condition) and intrinsic probabilistic unpredictability (when the committor function
depends sensitively on the initial condition). We also demonstrate that the Jin and Timmerman model
might be the first example of a stochastic differential equation with weak noise for which transition
between attractors do not follow the Arrhenius law, which is expected based on large deviation theory
and generic hypothesis.

The mechanisms that drive metal-to-insulator transitions (MIT) in correlated solids are not fully
understood. For example, the perovskite (PV) SrCoO3 is a FM metal while the oxygen-deficient (n-doped)
brownmillerite (BM) SrCoO2.5 is an anti-ferromagnetic (AFM) insulator. Given the magnetic and
structural transitions that accompany the MIT, the driver for such a MIT transition is unclear.
We also observe that the perovskite metals LaNiO3, SrFeO3, and SrCoO3 also undergo MIT when n-doped
via high-to-low valence compositional changes. Also, pressurizing the insulating BM SrCoO2.5
phase, drives a gap closing. Using DFT and correlated diffusion Monte Carlo approaches we demonstrate
that the ABO3 perovskites most prone to MIT are self hole-doped materials, reminiscent of a negative
charge-transfer system. Upon n-doping away from the negative-charge transfer metallic phase,
an underlying charge-lattice (or e-phonon) coupling drives the system to a bond-disproportionated
gapped state, thereby achieving ligand hole passivation at certain sites only, leading to charge-disproportionated
states. The size of the gap opened is correlated with the size of the hole-filling at these ligand
sites. This suggests that the interactions driving the gap opening to realize a MIT even in correlated
metals is the charge-transfer energy, but it couples with the underlying phonons to enable the transition
to the insulating phase. Other orderings (magnetic, charge, etc.) driven by weaker interactions
are secondary and may assist gap openings at small dopings, but its the charge-transfer energy that
predominantly determines the bandgap, with a negative energy preferring the metallic phase. This
n-doping can be achieved by modulations in stoichiometry or composition or pressure. Hence, controlling
the amount of the ligand-hole is key in controlling MIT. We compare our predictions to experiments
where possible.

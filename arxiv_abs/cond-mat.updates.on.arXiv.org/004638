Differential dynamic microscopy (DDM) is a form of video image analysis that combines the sensitivity
of scattering and the direct visualization benefits of microscopy. DDM is broadly useful in determining
dynamical properties including the intermediate scattering function for many spatiotemporally
correlated systems. Despite its straightforward analysis, DDM has not been fully adopted as a routine
characterization tool, largely due to computational cost and lack of algorithmic robustness.
We present a comprehensive statistical framework that aims at quantifying error, reducing the
computational order and enhancing the robustness of DDM analysis. We quantify the error, and propagate
an independent noise term to derive a closed-form expression of the expected value and variance
of the observed image structure function. Significantly, we propose an unbiased estimator of the
mean of the noise in the observed image structure function, which can be determined experimentally
and significantly improves the accuracy of applications of DDM. Furthermore, through use of Gaussian
Process Regression (GPR), we find that predictive samples of the image structure function require
only around 1% of the Fourier Transforms of the observed quantities. This vastly reduces computational
cost, while preserving information of the quantities of interest, such as quantiles of the image
scattering function, for subsequent analysis. The approach, which we call DDM with Uncertainty
Quantification (DDM-UQ), is validated using both simulations and experiments with respect to
accuracy and computational efficiency, as compared with conventional DDM and multiple particle
tracking. Overall, we propose that DDM-UQ lays the foundation for important new applications of
DDM, as well as to high-throughput characterization.

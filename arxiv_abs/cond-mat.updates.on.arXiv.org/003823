Exposure of metal surfaces to multiple ultrashort laser pulses under certain conditions leads
to the formation of well-defined periodic surface structures. We show how the period of such structures
in steel can be tuned over a wide range by controlling the complex interaction mechanisms triggered
in the material. Amongst the different irradiation parameters that influence the properties of
the induced structures, the angle of incidence of the laser beam occupies a prominent role. We present
an experimental and theoretical investigation of this angle dependence in steel upon irradiation
with laser pulses of 120 fs duration and 800 nm wavelength, while moving the sample at constant speed.
Our findings can be grouped into two blocks. First, we observe the spatial coexistence of two different
ripple periods at the steel surface, both featuring inverse scaling upon angle increase, which
are related to forward and backward propagation of surface plasmon polaritons. To understand the
underlying physical phenomena, we extend a recently developed model that takes into account quantitative
properties of the surface roughness to the case of absorbing metals (large imaginary part of the
dielectric function), and obtain an excellent match with the experimentally observed angle dependence.
As second important finding, we observe a quill writing effect, also termed non-reciprocal writing,
in form of a significant change of the ripple period upon reversing the sample movement direction.
This remarkable phenomenon has been observed so far only inside dielectric materials and our work
underlines its importance also in laser surface processing. We attribute the origin of symmetry
breaking to the non-symmetric micro- and nanoscale roughness induced upon static multiple pulse
irradiation, leading to non-symmetric modification of the wavevector of the coupled surface plasmon
polariton.

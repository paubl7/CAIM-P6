We study the properties of a spin-down neutron impurity immersed in a low-density free Fermi gas
of spin-up neutrons. In particular, we analyze its energy ($E_\downarrow$), effective mass ($m^*_\downarrow$)
and quasiparticle residue ($Z_\downarrow$). Results are compared with those of state-of-the-art
quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the attractive Fermi polaron realized in ultracold atomic
gases experiments, and with those of previous studies of the neutron polaron. Calculations are
performed within the Brueckner--Hartree--Fock approach using the chiral two-body nucleon-nucleon
interaction of Entem and Machleidt at N$^3$LO with a 500 MeV cut-off and the Argonne V18 phenomenological
potential. Only contributions from the $^1S_0$ partial wave, which is the dominant one in the low-density
region considered, are included. Contributions from three-nucleon forces are expected to be irrelevant
at these densities and, therefore, are neglected in the calculation. Our results show that for Fermi
momenta between $\sim 0.25$ and $\sim 0.45$ fm$^{-1}$ the energy, effective mass and quasiparticle
residue of the impurity vary only slightly, respectively, in the ranges $-0.604\,E_F < E_\downarrow
< -0.635\,E_F $, $1.300\,m < m^*_\downarrow < 1.085\, m$ and $0.741 <Z_\downarrow< 0.836$ in the
case of the chiral interaction, and $-0.621\,E_F < E_\downarrow < -0.643\,E_F $, $1.310\,m < m^*_\downarrow
< 1.089\, m$ and $0.739 <Z_\downarrow< 0.832$ when using the Argonne V18 potential. These results
are compatible with those derived from ultracold atoms and show that a spin-down neutron impurity
in a free Fermi gas of spin-up neutrons with a Fermi momentum in the range $0.25\lesssim k_F \lesssim
0.45$ fm$^{-1}$ exhibits properties very similar to those of an attractive Fermi polaron in the
unitary limit.

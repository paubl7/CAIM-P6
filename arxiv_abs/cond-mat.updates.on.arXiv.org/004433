Two dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) materials, such as MoS2, WS2, MoSe2,
and WSe2, have received extensive attention in the past decade due to their extraordinary physical
properties. The unique properties make them become ideal materials for various electronic, photonic
and optoelectronic devices. However, their performance is limited by the relatively weak light-matter
interactions due to their atomically thin form factor. Resonant nanophotonic structures provide
a viable way to address this issue and enhance light-matter interactions in 2D TMDCs. Here, we provide
an overview of this research area, showcasing relevant applications, including exotic light emission,
absorption and scattering features. We start by overviewing the concept of excitons in 1L-TMDC
and the fundamental theory of cavity-enhanced emission, followed by a discussion on the recent
progress of enhanced light emission, strong coupling and valleytronics. The atomically thin nature
of 1L-TMDC enables a broad range of ways to tune its electric and optical properties. Thus, we continue
by reviewing advances in TMDC-based tunable photonic devices. Next, we survey the recent progress
in enhanced light absorption over narrow and broad bandwidths using 1L or few-layer TMDCs, and their
applications for photovoltaics and photodetectors. We also review recent efforts of engineering
light scattering, e.g., inducing Fano resonances, wavefront engineering in 1L or few-layer TMDCs
by either integrating resonant structures, such as plasmonic/Mie resonant metasurfaces, or directly
patterning monolayer/few layers TMDCs. We then overview the intriguing physical properties of
different types of van der Waals heterostructures, and their applications in optoelectronic and
photonic devices. Finally, we draw our opinion on potential opportunities and challenges in this
rapidly developing field of research.

The natural habitats of microorganisms in the human microbiome and ocean and soil ecosystems are
full of colloids and macromolecules, which impart non-Newtonian flow properties drastically
affecting the locomotion of swimming microorganisms. Although the low-Reynolds-number hydrodynamics
of the swimming of flagellated bacteria in simple Newtonian fluids has been well developed, our
understanding of bacterial motility in complex non-Newtonian fluids is still primitive. Even
after six decades of research, fundamental questions about the nature and origin of bacterial motility
enhancement in polymer solutions are still under debate. Here, we study the motility of flagellated
bacteria in colloidal suspensions of varying sizes and volume fractions. We find that bacteria
in dilute colloidal suspensions display quantitatively the same motile behaviors as those in dilute
polymer solutions, where a universal particle-size-dependent motility enhancement up to 80%
is uncovered, accompanied by strong suppression of bacterial wobbling. By virtue of the well-controlled
size and the hard-sphere nature of colloids, the finding not only resolves the long-standing controversy
over bacterial motility enhancement in complex fluids but also challenges all the existing theories
using polymer dynamics to address the swimming of flagellated bacteria in dilute polymer solutions.
We further develop a simple physical model incorporating the colloidal nature of complex fluids,
which quantitatively explains bacterial wobbling dynamics and mobility enhancement in both colloidal
and polymeric fluids. Our study sheds light on the puzzling motile behaviors of bacteria in complex
fluids relevant to a wide range of microbiological processes and provides a cornerstone in engineering
bacterial swimming in complex environments.

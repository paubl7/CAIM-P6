We provide a comprehensive quantitative analysis of localized and extended topological defects
in the steady state of 2D passive and active repulsive Brownian disk systems. We show that, both in
and out-of-equilibrium, the passage from the solid to the hexatic is driven by the unbinding of dislocations,
in quantitative agreement with the KTHNY singularity. Instead, although disclinations dissociate
as soon as the liquid phase appears, extended clusters of defects largely dominate below the solid-hexatic
critical line. The latter percolate in the liquid phase very close to the hexatic-liquid transition,
both for continuous and discontinuous transitions, in the homogeneous liquid regime. At critical
percolation the clusters of defects are fractal with statistical and geometric properties that,
within our numerical accuracy, are independent of the activity and compatible with the universality
class of uncorrelated critical percolation. We also characterize the spatial organization of
different kinds of point-like defects and we show that the disclinations are not free, but rather
always very near more complex defect structures. At high activity, the bulk of the dense phase generated
by Motility-Induced Phase Separation is characterized by a density of point-like defects, and
statistics and morphology of defect clusters, set by the amount of activity and not the packing fraction.
Hexatic domains within the dense phase are separated by grain-boundaries along which a finite network
of topological defects resides, interrupted by gas bubbles in cavitation. The fractal dimension
of this network diminishes for increasing activity. This structure is dynamic in the sense that
the defect network allows for an unzipping mechanism that leaves free space for gas bubbles to appear,
close, and even be released into the dilute phase.

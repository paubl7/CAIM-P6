Magnets with frustration often show accidental degeneracies, characterised by a large classical
ground state space (CGSS). Quantum fluctuations may select a particular element of this space via
the well known `order by disorder' (ObD) paradigm. Recent studies by the current authors propose
a distinct selection mechanism -- `order by singularity' (ObS) -- that can occur when the CGSS self-intersects.
This effect has been demonstrated in clusters containing a few spins. In this article, we draw a qualitative
distinction between these two selection paradigms. We argue that the magnet, at low energies, maps
to a particle moving on the CGSS. State selection corresponds to localization of the particle at
a certain point on this space. In ObD, the particle localizes at a minimum of a fluctuation-generated
potential. In contrast, in ObS, the particle localizes at a self-intersection point due to bound
state formation -- a consequence of quantum interference. We place our discussion within the context
of the one-dimensional spin-$S$ Kitaev model. We map out its CGSS which grows systematically with
increasing system size. It resembles a network where the number of nodes increases exponentially.
In addition, the number of wires that cross at each node also grows exponentially. This self-intersecting
structure leads to ObS, with the low-energy physics determined by a small subset of the CGSS, consisting
of `cartesian' states. A contrasting picture emerges upon introducing an additional XY antiferromagnetic
coupling. The CGSS simplifies dramatically, taking the form of a circle. Spin wave fluctuations
generate a potential on this space. We discuss the conditions under which this potential gives rise
to state selection by ObD. Apart from contrasting ObS and ObD, we discuss the possibility of ObS in
macroscopic magnets.

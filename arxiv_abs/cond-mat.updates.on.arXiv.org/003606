We consider the Heisenberg sawtooth spin chain with ferromagnetic zigzag bonds J1 and competing
antiferromagnetic basal bonds J2. At a quantum phase transition point |J2/J1|=1/2 this model exhibits
a flat one-magnon excitation band leading to a massively degenerate ground-state manifold which
results in a large residual entropy. Thus, for the spin-half model the residual entropy amounts
to exactly one half of its maximum value $\lim_{T\to\infty} S(T)/N = \ln2$. In the present paper
we study in detail the role of the spin quantum number s and the magnetic field H in the parameter region
around the transition (flat-band) point. For that we use full exact diagonalization up to N=20 lattice
sites as well as the finite-temperature Lanczos method up to N=36 sites to calculate the density
of states as well as the temperature dependence of the specific heat, the entropy and the susceptibility.
The study of chain lengths up to N=36 allows a careful finite-size analysis. At the flat-band point
we find extremely small finite-size effects for spin s=1/2, i.e., the numerical data virtually
correspond to the thermodynamic limit. In all other cases the finite-size effects are still small
and become visible at very low temperatures. In a sizeable parameter region around the flat-band
point the influence of the former massively degenerate ground-state manifold acts as a large manifold
of low-lying excitations leading to extraordinary thermodynamic properties at the transition
point as well as in the vicinity of it, such as an additional low-temperature maximum in the specific
heat. Moreover, there is a very strong influence of the magnetic field on the low-temperature thermodynamics
including an enhanced magnetocaloric effect.

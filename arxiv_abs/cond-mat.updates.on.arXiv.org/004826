Conductivity of Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) may be expressed as the topological invariant
composed of the two - point Green function. Such a topological invariant is known both for the case
of homogeneous systems with intrinsic Anomalous Quantum Hall Effect (AQHE) and for the case of IQHE
in the inhomogeneous systems. In the latter case we may speak, for example, of the AQHE in the presence
of elastic deformations and of the IQHE in presence of magnetic field. The topological invariant
for the general case of inhomogeneous systems is expressed through the Wigner transformed Green
functions and contains Moyal product. When it is reduced to the expression for the IQHE in the homogeneous
systems the Moyal product is reduced to the ordinary one while the Wigner transformed Green function
(defined in phase space) is reduced to the Green function in momentum space. Originally the mentioned
above topological representation has been derived for the non - interacting systems. We demonstrate
that in a wide range of different cases in the presence of interactions the Hall conductivity is given
by the same expression, in which the noninteracting two - point Green function is substituted by
the complete two - point Green function with the interactions taken into account. Several types
of interactions are considered including the contact four - fermion interactions, Yukawa and Coulomb
interactions. We present the complete proof of this statement up to the two loops, and argue that
the similar result remains to all orders of perturbation theory. It is based on the incorporation
of Wigner - Weyl calculus to the perturbation theory. We, therefore, formulate Feynmann rules of
diagram technique in terms of the Wigner transformed propagators.

Heterojunction Si solar cells exhibit notable performance degradation. This is a substantial
challenge for their market acceptance and for basic science. To shed light on the underlying causes,
we studied this problem by layering several techniques on top of each other to determine the dynamics
of electronic defect generation. First, we created aSi/cSi stacks by performing molecular dynamics
simulations, using femtosecond time-steps and an Artificial-Intelligence-based GAP interatomic
potential, followed by optimization with density functional theory. Next, we performed local
heat blasting to create localized structural defects. We then analyzed the generated structural
defects by the Inverse Participation Ratio (IPR) method to identify which structural defects induced
electronic defects. Next, we adapted the Nudged Elastic Band (NEB) method to determine the energy
barriers that control the formation of these electronic defects. We performed the NEB method for
thousands of electronic defects to determine the distributions of these energy barriers. Finally,
we developed an Accelerated Superbasin Kinetic Monte Carlo approach to determine the time dependence
of the electronic defect generation, as controlled by this energy barrier distribution. The determination
of the energy barriers out to 4 eV enabled us to determine the defect generation out to gigaseconds,
or of the order of 10 years. Our method is thus capable of connecting physical processes from femtoseconds
to gigaseconds. Our main conclusions are that even in dark conditions, thermal activation processes
lead to a substantial increase in the electronic defect density. Further, we also simulated the
same processes at the accelerated testing temperature of 350K, and established a quantitative
relationship between the regular and accelerated defect generation, thus making accelerated
testing a more quantitative assessment tool.

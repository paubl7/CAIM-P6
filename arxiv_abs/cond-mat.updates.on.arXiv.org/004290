We report the results of polarization-resolved Raman-scattering for the family of excitonic insulator
candidate materials Ta$_2$Ni(Se$_{1-x}$S$_x$)$_5$ ($x = 0$, 0.25, 0.67, 1), focusing on the properties
of the even-symmetry optical phonons. We observe all of the expected 11 Raman-active optical phonon
modes, identify their symmetry, and obtain the temperature dependence for their spectral parameters,
including the frequency, the relaxation rate and the integrated intensity. Additionally, the
change in selection rules allows us to determine the orthorhombic-to-monoclinic structural transition
temperature $T_c$ for all compositions and we find it to decrease monotonically from 328 K for Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$
to 120 K for Ta$_2$NiS$_5$. For Ta$_2$Ni(Se$_{1-x}$S$_x$)$_5$ with $x < 0.7$, we find the two lowest-energy
$B_{2g}$ phonon modes to show strongly asymmetric lineshapes in the high-temperature phase due
to Fano interference with an excitonic continuum; we develop a quantitative description of their
lineshape, allowing us to obtain the phonon parameters also above $T_c$. For Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ we
also observe signatures of acoustic modes scattered by the structural domains formed below $T_c$.
For Ta$_2$NiS$_5$, all $B_{2g}$ phonon modes preserve symmetric lineshape, however, their energy
anomalously decreases on cooling. The temperature dependence of the spectral parameters of most
modes is found to be consistent with anharmonic effects; for the alloy compositions $x=0.25,0.67$
they also display two-mode behavior. Finally, we demonstrate that the frequencies of the modes
are generally in agreement with first principles calculations and the latter also allow to explain
the differences between the coupling strengths of the $B_{2g}$ phonons with the excitonic continuum.

Predicting the electrical properties of organic molecular crystals (OMCs) is challenging due
to their complex crystal structures and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions. Charge transport
in OMCs is conventionally categorized into two limiting regimes $-$ band transport, characterized
by weak e-ph interactions and governed by low-energy intermolecular vibrations, and charge hopping,
where strong e-ph interactions form localized polarons that diffuse slowly via thermally activated
processes. However, between these two limiting cases there is a common, but less well understood
intermediate transport regime where polarons are present but transport does not occur via hopping.
Here we show accurate first-principles calculations of the carrier mobility in the intermediate
charge transport regime, and shed light on its microscopic origin. We combine a finite-temperature
cumulant method to describe the strong e-ph interactions and Green-Kubo transport calculations.
Our study on naphthalene crystal demonstrates that we can accurately predict the electron mobility
in the intermediate regime, within a factor of 1.5$-$2 of experiment between 100$-$300 K. Our analysis
reveals that electrons couple strongly with both inter- and intramolecular phonons in the intermediate
regime, as evidenced by the formation of a broad polaron satellite peak in the electron spectral
function and by significant changes in the quasiparticle peak linewidth and spectral weight. These
higher-order e-ph interactions make transport calculations based on the Boltzmann equation inadequate
to describe the intermediate regime. Our study advances the understanding of the intermediate
regime and paves the way for quantitative modeling of charge transport in complex organic crystals.

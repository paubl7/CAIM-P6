We question the network affinity assumption in modeling chain orientations under polymer deformations,
and the use of the stretch measure projected from the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor (or
non-affine micro-stretches derived from that measure) as a basic state variable for the micro-macro
transition. These ingredients are standard, taken from the statistical theory of polymers, and
used in most micromechanical polymer network and soft tissue models. The affinity assumption imposes
a constraint in the network which results in an anisotropic distribution of the orientation of the
chains and, hence, in an additional configurational entropy that should be included. This additional
entropy would result in an additional stress tensor. But an arguably more natural alternative,
in line with the typical assumption for the chain behavior itself and with the disregard of these
forces, is to consider that the network may fluctuate unconstrained to adapt to macroscopic deformations.
This way, the isotropic statistical distribution of the orientation of the chains is maintained
unconstrained during deformation and no additional stress is imposed. Then, we show that this free-fluctuating
network assumption is equivalent to consider the stretch projected from the stretch tensor (instead
of the right Cauchy-Green deformation tensor) as the state variable for the deformation of the network
chains. We show very important differences in predictions using both assumed behaviors, and demonstrate
that with the free-fluctuating network assumption, we can obtain accurate predictions for all
tests in polymers using just one test curve to calibrate the model. With the same macro-micro-macro
approach employing the network affinity assumption, we are capable of capturing accurately only
the test used for calibration of the model, but not the overall polymer behavior.

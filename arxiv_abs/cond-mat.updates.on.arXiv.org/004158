Twelve two-dimensional group-IV monochalcogenide monolayers (SiS, SiSe, SiTe, GeS, GeSe, GeTe,
SnS, SnSe, SnTe, PbS, PbSe, and PbTe) with a buckled honeycomb atomistic structure--belonging
to symmetry group P3m1--and an out-of-plane intrinsic electric polarization are shown to be metastable
by three independendent methods. First, we uncover a coordination-preserving structural transformation
from the low-buckled honeycomb structure onto the lower-energy Pnm2$_1$ (or Pmmn for PbS, PbSe,
and PbTe) phase to estimate {\em energy barriers} $E_B$ that must be overcome during such structural
transformation. Using the curvature of the local minima and $E_B$ as inputs to Kramers escape formula,
large escape times are found, implying the structural metastability of the buckled honeycomb phase
(nevertheless, and with the exception of PbS and PbSe, these phases display escape times ranging
from 700 years to multiple times the age of the universe, and can be considered "stable" for practical
purposes only in that relative sense). The second demonstration is provided by phonon dispersion
relations that include the effect of long-range Coulomb forces and display no negative vibrational
modes. The third and final demonstration of structural metastability is furnished by room-temperature
{\em ab initio} molecular dynamics for selected compounds. The magnitude of the electronic band
gap evolves with chemical composition. Different from other binary two-dimensional compounds
such as transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers and hexagonal boron nitride monolayers which
only develop an in-plane piezoelectric response, the twelve group-IV monochalcogenide monolayers
with a buckled honeycomb structure also display out-of-plane piezoelectric properties.

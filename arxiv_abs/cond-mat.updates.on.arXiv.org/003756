A synaptic theory of Working Memory (WM) has been developed in the last decade as a possible alternative
to the persistent spiking paradigm. In this context, we have developed a neural mass model able to
reproduce exactly the dynamics of heterogeneous spiking neural networks encompassing realistic
cellular mechanisms for short-term synaptic plasticity. This population model reproduces the
macroscopic dynamics of the network in terms of the firing rate and the mean membrane potential.
The latter quantity allows us to get insight on Local Field Potential and electroencephalographic
signals measured during WM tasks to characterize the brain activity. More specifically synaptic
facilitation and depression integrate each other to efficiently mimic WM operations via either
synaptic reactivation or persistent activity. Memory access and loading are associated to stimulus-locked
transient oscillations followed by a steady-state activity in the $\beta-\gamma$ band, thus resembling
what observed in the cortex during vibrotactile stimuli in humans and object recognition in monkeys.
Memory juggling and competition emerge already by loading only two items. However more items can
be stored in WM by considering neural architectures composed of multiple excitatory populations
and a common inhibitory pool. Memory capacity depends strongly on the presentation rate of the items
and it maximizes for an optimal frequency range. In particular we provide an analytic expression
for the maximal memory capacity. Furthermore, the mean membrane potential turns out to be a suitable
proxy to measure the memory load, analogously to event driven potentials in experiments on humans.
Finally we show that the $\gamma$ power increases with the number of loaded items, as reported in
many experiments, while $\theta$ and $\beta$ power reveal non monotonic behaviours.

Quasiparticles are physically motivated mathematical constructs for simplifying the seemingly
complicated many-body description of solids. A complete understanding of their dynamics and the
nature of the effective interactions between them provides rich information on real material properties
at the microscopic level. In this work, we explore the dynamics and interactions of magnon quasiparticles
in a ferromagnetic spin-1 Heisenberg chain with easy-axis onsite anisotropy, a model relevant
for the explanation of recent terahertz optics experiments on NiNb$_2$O$_6$ [P. Chauhan et al.,
Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 037203 (2020)], and nonequilibrium dynamics in ultra cold atomic settings
[W.C. Chung et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 126, 163203 (2021)]. We build a picture for the properties of
clouds of few magnons with the help of exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization
group calculations supported by physically motivated Jastrow wavefunctions. We show how the binding
energy of magnons effectively reduces with their number and explain how this energy scale is of direct
relevance for dynamical magnetic susceptibility measurements. This understanding is used to
make predictions for ultra cold-atomic platforms which are ideally suited to study the thermalization
of multimagnon states. We simulate the non-equilibrium dynamics of these chains using the matrix
product state based time-evolution block decimation algorithm and explore the dependence of revivals
and thermalization on magnon density and easy-axis onsite anisotropy (which controls the strength
of effective magnon interactions). We observe behaviors akin to those reported for many-body quantum
scars which we explain with an analytic approximation that is accurate in the limit of small anisotropy.

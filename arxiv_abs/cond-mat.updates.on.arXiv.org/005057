In our previously published work, we have reported colossal magnetoresistance, Andreev oscillations,
ferromagnetism, and granular superconductivity in oxygen-implanted carbon fibers, graphite
foils, and highly oriented pyrolytic graphite. In this follow-up research, more results on these
oxygen-implanted graphite samples are presented. We show results from transport measurements
on oxygen-implanted diamond-like carbon thin coatings, amorphous carbon films, and highly oriented
pyrolytic graphite. Significantly, a three-order magnitude drop in the electrical resistance
of the oxygen-implanted diamond-like carbon films is observed at the 50 K temperature that we have
previously reported for the transition to the superconducting state. Below 50 K, the films resistance
oscillates between the high and low resistance states, less when the sample is under a transverse
magnetic field. This metastability between the insulating and superconducting-like states possibly
reflects the evolution of the amplitude for the superconducting order parameter also known as the
longitudinal Higgs mode. Transitions to low resistance state and metastability are also observed
for amorphous carbon films. Finally, the highly oriented pyrolytic graphite samples resistance
have a thermally activated term that can be understood on the basis of the LAMH model applied to narrow
SC channels in which thermal fluctuations can cause phase slips. We also find that in oxygen-implanted
carbon materials, the electron charge and spin correlations do not compete and their interplay
rather facilitates the emergence of high-temperature superconductivity, and thus, additional
unexpected effects like Heisenberg spin waves and magneto-structural transitions are observed.

Understanding the electron pairing in hole-doped cuprate superconductors has been a challenge,
in particular because the "normal" state from which it evolves is unprecedented. Now, after three
and a half decades of research, involving a wide range of experimental characterizations, it is
possible to delineate a clear and consistent cuprate story. It starts with doping holes into a charge-transfer
insulator, resulting in in-gap states. These states exhibit a pseudogap resulting from the competition
between antiferromagnetic superexchange $J$ between nearest-neighbor Cu atoms (a real-space
interaction) and the kinetic energy of the doped holes, which, in the absence of interactions, would
lead to extended Bloch-wave states whose occupancy is characterized in reciprocal space. To develop
some degree of coherence on cooling, the spin and charge correlations must self-organize in a cooperative
fashion. A specific example of resulting emergent order is that of spin and charge stripes, as observed
in La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$. While stripe order frustrates bulk superconductivity, it nevertheless
develops pairing and superconducting order of an unusual character. The antiphase order of the
spin stripes decouples them from the charge stripes, which can be viewed as hole-doped, two-leg,
spin-$\frac12$ ladders. To achieve superconducting order, the pair correlations in neighboring
ladders must develop phase order. In the presence of spin stripe order, antiphase Josephson coupling
can lead to pair-density-wave superconductivity. Alternatively, in-phase superconductivity
requires that the spin stripes have an energy gap, which empirically limits the coherent superconducting
gap. Hence, superconducting order in the cuprates involves a compromise between the pairing scale,
which is maximized at $x\sim\frac18$, and phase coherence, which is optimized at $x\sim0.2$.

Recent studies have shown that the non-relativistic antiferromagnetic ordering could generate
momentum-dependent spin splitting analogous to the Rashba effect, but free from the requirement
of relativistic spin-orbit coupling. Whereas the classification of such compounds can be illustrated
by different spin-splitting prototypes (SSTs) from symmetry analysis and density functional
theory calculations, the significant variation in bonding and structure of these diverse compounds
representing different SSTs clouds the issue of how much of the variation in spin splitting can be
traced back to the symmetry-defined characteristics, rather to the underlining chemical and structural
diversity. The alternative model Hamiltonian approaches do not confront the issues of chemical
and structural complexity, but often consider only the magnetic sublattice, dealing with the all-important
effects of the non-magnetic ligands via renormalizing the interactions between the magnetic sites.
To this end we constructed a 'DFT model Hamiltonian' that allows us to study SSTs at approximate 'constant
chemistry', while retaining the realistic atomic scale structure including ligands. This is accomplished
by using a single, universal magnetic skeletal lattice (Ni2+ ions in Rocksalt NiO) and designing
small displacements of the non-magnetic (oxygen) sublattice which produce, by design, the different
SSTs magnetic symmetries. We show that (i) even similar crystal structures having very similar
band structures can lead to contrasting behavior of spin splitting vs. momentum, and (ii) even subtle
deformations of the non-magnetic ligand sublattice could cause a giant spin splitting in AFM-induced
SST. This is a paradigm shift relative to the convention of modeling magnets without considering
the non-magnetic ligand that mediate indirect magnetic interaction (e.g., super exchange).

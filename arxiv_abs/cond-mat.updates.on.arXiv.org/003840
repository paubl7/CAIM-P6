Quasi-particle self-consistent $GW$ calculations are presented for the band structures of LiGaO2
and NaGaO2 in the orthorhombic $Pna2_1$ tetrahedrally coordinated crystal structures. Symmetry
labeling of the bands near the gap is carried out and effective mass tensors are extracted for the
conduction band minimum and crystal field split valence band maxima at $\Gamma$. The gap is found
to be direct at $\Gamma$ and is 5.81 eV in LiGaO2 and 5.46 eV in NaGaO2. Electron-phonon coupling zero-point
normalization is estimated to lower these gaps by about 0.2 eV. Optical response functions are calculated
within the independent particle long wavelength limit and show the expected anisotropy of the absorption
onsets due to the crystal field splitting of the VBM. The results show that both materials are promising
candidates as ultrawide gap semiconductors with wurtzite based tetrahedrally bonded crystal
structures. Direct transitions from the lowest conduction band to higher bands, relevant to n-type
doped material and transparent conduction applications are found to start only above 3.9 eV and
are allowed for only one polarization, and several higher band transitions are forbidden by symmetry.
Alternative crystal structures, such as $R\bar{3}m$ and a rocksalt type phase with tetragonally
distorted $P4/mmm$ spacegroup, both with octahedral coordination of the cations are also investigated.
They are found to have higher energy but about 20 \% smaller volume per formula unit. The transition
pressures to these phases are determined and for LiGaO2 found to be in good agreement with experimental
studies. The $R\bar{3}m$phase also has a comparably high but slightly indirect band gap while the
rocksalt type phase if found to have a considerably smaller gap of about 3.1 eV in LiGaO2 and 1.0 eV
in NaGaO2.

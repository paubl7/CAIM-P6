In general, with the addition of solutes, the yield strength of alloys is expected to increase and
this phenomenon is known as solid solution strengthening. However, reports on the ``anomalous''
softening with alloying additions are not uncommon; for example, it is known that the heterogeneous
nucleation of dislocations at the sites of solute atoms can lead to softening. In this study, using
Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations, we show anomalous softening in Cu-Al alloys deformed at 300
K; specifically, not only the yield stress but also the magnitude of stress drop at yield decrease
with increasing Al content. We calculate the stress needed for the homogeneous nucleation of partial
dislocation loops using a continuum model. One of the key inputs to the continuum model is the stacking
fault energy (SFE). We carry out the thermodynamic integration to evaluate the free energies in
crystals with and without the stacking faults and hence calculate the SFE as a function of Al content
at 300 K. Using the SFE values thus obtained we show that softening is a consequence of the reduction
of SFE values with the addition of Al in a system where yielding is controlled by the nucleation of
dislocation loops. Specifically, the results of continuum model are in good agreement with MD simulation
results of pure copper. However, in the Cu-Al alloys, the drop in yield strength can only be explained
using a combination of the continuum model (which assumes homogeneous nucleation), and the reduction
in heterogeneous nucleation barrier (which is a function of the ratio of the unstable and stable
stacking fault energies). We show that the decrease in stress drop can be rationalised in terms of
the stored energy available at yielding -- the stored energy at yielding decreases with increasing
Al, and, as a result, the maximum dislocation density decreases with increasing Al content.

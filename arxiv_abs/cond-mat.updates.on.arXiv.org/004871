Being the polymorphs of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), vaterite and calcite have attracted a great
deal of attention as promising biomaterials for drug delivery and tissue engineering applications.
Furthermore, they are important biogenic minerals, enabling living organisms to reach specific
functions. In nature, vaterite and calcite monocrystals typically form self-assembled polycrystal
micro- and nanoparticles, also referred to as spherulites. Here, we demonstrate that alpine plants
belonging to the Saxifraga genus can tailor light scattering channels and utilize multipole interference
effect to improve light collection efficiency via producing CaCO3 polycrystal nanoparticles
on the margins of their leaves. To provide a clear physical background behind this concept, we study
optical properties of artificially synthesized vaterite nanospherulites and reveal the phenomenon
of directional light scattering. Darkfield spectroscopy measurements are supported by a comprehensive
numerical analysis, accounting for the complex microstructure of particles. We demonstrate the
appearance of generalized Kerker condition, where several higher order multipoles interfere
constructively in the forward direction, governing the interaction phenomenon. As a result, highly
directive forward light scattering from vaterite nanospherulites is observed in the entire visible
range. Furthermore, ex vivo studies of microstructure and optical properties of leaves for the
alpine plants Saxifraga 'Southside Seedling' and Saxifraga Paniculata Ria are performed and underlined
the importance of Kerker effect for these living organisms. Our results pave the way for a bioinspired
strategy of efficient light collection by selfassembled polycrystal CaCO3 nanoparticles via
tailoring light propagation directly to the photosynthetic tissue with minimal losses to undesired
scattering channels.

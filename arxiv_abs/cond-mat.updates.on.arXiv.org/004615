(Fe,Co)$_2$B-based compounds with specified 5$d$ substitutions are considered as promising
materials for permanent magnets without rare-earth elements. We conducted a combined first-principles
and experimental study focused on (Fe$_{0.7}$Co$_{0.3}$)$_2$B alloys doped with W and Re. First,
we used full-potential local-orbital scheme to systematically investigate (Fe,Co)$_2$B alloys
with 3$d$, 4$d$, and 5$d$ substitutions. Computational analyses showed a significant increase
in magnetocrystalline anisotropy only for the Re doped sample. Simultaneously, the structural
and magnetic properties of the (Fe$_{0.7-x}$Co$_{0.3-x}$M$_{2x}$)$_2$B ($M$ = W, Re; $x$ = 0,
0.025) alloys were investigated experimentally. The desired (Fe,Co)$_2$B tetragonal phase was
synthesized by heat treatment of amorphous precursors. We observed that isothermal annealing
increases the coercive field of all samples. However, the obtained values, without further optimization,
are well below the threshold for permanent magnet applications. Nevertheless, annealing of substituted
samples at 750$^o$C significantly improves saturation magnetization values. Furthermore, M\"{o}ssbauer
spectroscopy revealed a reduction of the hyperfine field due to the presence of Co atoms in the (Fe,Co)$_2$B
phase, where additional defect positions are formed by Re and W. Radio-frequency M\"{o}ssbauer
studies showed that (Fe$_{0.7}$Co$_{0.3}$)$_2$B and the W-substituted sample began to crystallize
when exposed to an radio frequency field of 12 Oe, indicating that the amorphous phase is stabilized
by Re substitution. Improvement of thermal stability of (Fe$_{0.675}$Co$_{0.275}$Re$_{0.05}$)$_2$B
alloy is consistent with the results of differential scanning calorimetry and thermomagnetic
measurements.

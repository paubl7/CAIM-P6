Materials with continuous dissipation can exhibit responses and functionalities that are not
possible in thermodynamic equilibrium. While this concept is well-known, a major challenge has
been the implementation: how to rationally design materials with functional non-equilibrium
states and quantify the dissipation? Here we address these questions for the widely used colloidal
nanoparticles that convey several functionalities. We propose that useful non-equilibrium states
can be realised by creating and maintaining steady-state nanoparticle concentration gradients
by continuous injection and dissipation of energy. We experimentally demonstrate this with superparamagnetic
iron oxide nanoparticles that in thermodynamic equilibrium form a homogeneous functional fluid
with a strong magnetic response (a ferrofluid). To create non-equilibrium functionalities, we
charge the nanoparticles with anionic charge control agents to create electroferrofluids where
nanoparticles act as charge carriers that can be driven with electric fields and current to non-homogeneous
dissipative steady-states. The dissipative steady-states exhibit voltage-controlled magnetic
properties and emergent diffuse interfaces. The diffuse interfaces respond strongly to external
magnetic fields, leading to dissipative patterns that are not possible in the equilibrium state.
We identify the closest non-dissipative analogues of these dissipative patterns, discuss the
differences, and highlight how pattern formation in electroferrofluids is linked to dissipation
that can be directly quantified. Beyond electrically controlled ferrofluids and patterns, we
foresee that the concept can be generalized to other functional nanoparticles to create various
scientifically and technologically relevant non-equilibrium states with optical, electrical,
catalytic, and mechanical responses that are not possible in thermodynamic equilibrium.

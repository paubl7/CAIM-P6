We introduce an algorithm, the Orthogonal Operator Polynomial Expansion (OOPEX), to approximately
compute expectation values in energy eigenstates at finite energy density of non-integrable quantum
many-body systems with polynomial effort, whereas exact diagonalization (ED) of the Hamiltonian
$H$ is exponentially hard. The OOPEX relies on the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis, which
conjectures that eigenstate expectation values of physical observables in such systems vary smoothly
with the eigenstate energy (and other macroscopic conserved quantities, if any), and computes
them through a series generated by repeated multiplications, rather than diagonalization, of
$H$ and whose successive terms oscillate faster with the energy. The hypothesis guarantees that
only the first few terms of this series contribute appreciably. We further show that the OOPEX, in
a sense, is the most optimum algorithm based on series expansions of $H$ as it avoids computing the
many-body density of states which plagues other similar algorithms. Then, we argue non-rigorously
that working in the Fock space of operators, rather than that of states as is usually done, yields
convergent results with computational resources that scale polynomially with $N$. We demonstrate
the polynomial scaling by applying the OOPEX to the non-integrable Ising chain and comparing with
ED and high-temperature expansion (HTX) results. The OOPEX provides access to much larger $N$ than
ED and HTX do, which facilitates overcoming finite-size effects that plague the other methods to
extract correlation lengths in chaotic eigenstates. In addition, access to large systems allows
testing a recent conjecture that the Renyi entropy of chaotic eigenstates has positive curvature
if the Renyi index $>1$, and we find encouraging supporting evidence.

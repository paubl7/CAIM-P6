Implicit solvent, coarse grained models with pairwise interactions can access the largest length
and time scales in molecular dynamics simulations, owing to the absence of computationally expensive
interactions with a huge number of solvent particles, the smaller number of interaction sites in
the model molecules, and the lack of fast sub-molecular degrees of freedom. Without an explicit
solvent, the solvent mediated effects, e.g. the hydrophobic effect and the hydration force, are
mimicked entirely through the interactions between the model molecules. In this paper, we describe
a maximally coarse-grained model for lipids in implicit water. The model is called SiMPLISTIC,
which is an acronym for Single-site Model with Pairwise interaction for Lipids in Implicit Solvent
with Tuneable Intrinsic Curvature. SiMPLISTIC lipids rapidly self-assemble into realistic phases
such as inverted micelles and bilayers, the spontaneous curvature of the phase being determined
by a single free parameter of the model. Model membrane simulations with lamellar SiMPLISTIC lipids
show satisfactory fluid and gel phases with interdigitation and tilt-free bilayers, and experimentally
relevant values of bending and stretching elasticities. SiMPLISTIC can also simulate mixtures
of lipids that differ in packing parameter or length, the latter leading to the phenomenon of hydrophobic
mismatch. The model has a large scope due to its speed, conceptual and computational simplicity,
and versatility. Applications range from academic and industrial research in various lipid based
systems, such as lyotropic liquid crystals, biological and biomimetic membranes, vectors for
drug and gene delivery, emulsions for cosmetic products, to education, such as understanding the
cooperative many-body physics in lipid-water systems through interactive simulations which
require a fast and simple, yet effective model.

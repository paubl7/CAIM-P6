The simulation of fracture using continuum ductile damage models attains a pathological discretization
dependence caused by strain localization, after loss of ellipticity of the problem, in regions
whose size is connected to the spatial discretization. Implicit gradient techniques suppress
this problem introducing some inelastic non-local fields and solving an enriched formulation
where the classical balance of linear momentum is fully coupled with a Helmholtz-type equation
for each of the non-local variable. Such Helmholtz-type equations determine the distribution
of the non-local fields in bands whose width is controlled by a characteristic length, independently
on the spatial discretization. The numerical resolution of this coupled problem using the Finite
Element method is computationally very expensive and its use to simulate the damage process in 3D
multi-phase microstructures becomes prohibitive. In this work, we propose a novel FFT-based iterative
algorithm for simulating gradient ductile damage in computational homogenization problems.
In particular, the Helmholtz-type equation of the implicit gradient approach is properly generalized
to model the regularization of damage in multi-phase media, where multiple damage variables and
different characteristic lengths may come into play. In the proposed iterative algorithm, two
distinct problems are solved in a staggered fashion: (i) a conventional mechanical problem via
a FFT-Galerkin solver with mixed macroscopic loading control and (ii) the generalized Helmholtz-type
equation using a Krylov-based algorithm combined with an efficient pre-conditioner. The numerical
implementation is firstly validated. Finally, the robustness and efficiency of the algorithm
is demonstrated in the simulation of failure of complex 3D particle reinforced composites characterized
by millions of degrees of freedom.

Targeted drug delivery relies on two physical processes: the selective binding of a therapeutic
particle to receptors on a specific cell membrane, followed by transport of the particle across
the membrane. In this article, we address some of the challenges in controlling the thermodynamics
and dynamics of these two processes by combining a simple experimental system with a statistical
mechanical model. Specifically, we characterize and model multivalent ligand-receptor binding
between colloidal particles and fluid lipid bilayers, as well as the surface mobility of membrane-bound
particles. We show that the mobility of the receptors within the fluid membrane is key to both the
thermodynamics and dynamics of binding. First, we find that the particle-membrane binding free
energy -- or avidity -- is a strongly nonlinear function of the ligand-receptor affinity. We attribute
the nonlinearity to a combination of multivalency and recruitment of fluid receptors to the binding
site. Our results also suggest that partial wrapping of the bound particles by the membrane enhances
avidity further. Second, we demonstrate that the lateral mobility of membrane-bound particles
is also strongly influenced by the recruitment of receptors. Specifically, we find that the lateral
diffusion coefficient of a membrane-bound particle is dominated by the hydrodynamic drag against
the aggregate of receptors within the membrane. These results provide one of the first direct validations
of the working theoretical framework for multivalent interactions. They also highlight that the
fluidity and elasticity of the membrane are as important as the ligand-receptor affinity in determining
the binding and transport of small particles attached to membranes.

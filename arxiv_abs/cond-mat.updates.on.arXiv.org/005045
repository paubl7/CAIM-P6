Two-dimensional (2D) ZrS2 monolayer (ML) has emerged as a promising candidate for thermoelectric
(TE) device applications due to its high TE figure of merit, which is mainly contributed by its inherently
low lattice thermal conductivity. This work investigates the effect of the lattice anharmonicity
driven by temperature-dependent phonon dispersions on thermal transport of ZrS2 ML. The calculations
are based on the self-consistent phonon (SCP) theory to calculate the thermodynamic parameters
along with the lattice thermal conductivity. The higher- order (quartic) force constants were
extracted by using an efficient compressive sensing lattice dynamics technique, which estimates
the necessary data based on the emerging machine learning program as an alternative of computationally
expensive density functional theory calculations. Resolve of the degeneracy and hardening of
the vibrational frequencies of low-energy optical modes were predicted upon including the quartic
anharmonicity. As compared to the conventional Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) approach,
the lattice thermal conductivity of the optimized ZrS2 ML unit cell within SCP + BTE approach is found
to be significantly enhanced (e.g., by 21% at 300 K). This enhancement is due to the relatively lower
value of phonon linewidth contributed by the anharmonic frequency renormalization included in
the SCP theory. Mainly, the conventional BTE approach neglects the temperature dependence of the
phonon frequencies due to the consideration of harmonic lattice dynamics and treats the normal
process of three-phonon scattering incorrectly due to the use of quasi-particle lifetimes. These
limitations are addressed in this work within the SCP + BTE approach, which signifies the validity
and accuracy of this approach.

The development of efficient photoelectrodes via defect engineering of wide-band gap metal oxides
has been the prime focus for many years. Specifically, the effect of carbon defects in wide-band
gap metal oxides on their performance in photoelectrochemical (PEC) applications raised numerous
controversies and still elusive. Herein, the effect of various carbon defects in m-ZrO2 was investigated
using the density functional theory to probe the thermodynamic, electronic, and optical properties
of the defective structures against pristine m-ZrO2. The defect formation energies revealed that
elevating the temperature promotes and facilitates the formation of carbon defects. Moreover,
the binding energies confirmed the stability of all studied complex carbon defects. Furthermore,
the band edge positions against the redox potentials of water species revealed that all the studied
defective structures can serve as photoanodes for water splitting. Additionally, CO3c (carbon
atom substituted O3c site) was the only defective structure that exhibited slight straddling of
the redox potentials of water. Importantly, all investigated defective structures enhanced light
absorption with different optical activities. Finally, CO3cVO3c (carbon atom substituted O3c
associated with O3c vacancy) defective m-ZrO2 enjoyed low direct band gap (1.9 eV), low defect formation
energy, low exciton binding energy, high mobility of charge carriers, fast charge transfer, and
low recombination rate. Concurrently, its optical properties were exceptional in terms of high
absorption, low reflectivity and improved static dielectric constant. Hence, the study recommends
CO3cVO3c defective m-ZrO2 as the leading candidate to serve as a photoanode for PEC applications.

In our previous work on shear flows of densely packed PDMS(dimethicone) particles, we have found
that the system exhibits an transition zone of driving rates, and interpreted the behaviors as consequences
of the speed-dependent friction between particles. To provide solid supports for the interpretation,
we set a force balance for time-resolving the contact force between two curved PDMS surfaces that
are sliding against each other. Two types of experiments include the passing of two semi-spheres,
and the sliding with a sustained contact between two orthogonal semi-cylinders of which one is moving
at a controlled speed $U$ with a fixed depth of compression $D_p$ into the other. For sphere-passing
experiments, the tangential force reveals a characteristic speed $V_c$, beyond which the time-averaged
value decays substantially with the increase of $U$, whereas the normal force shows no detectable
change. The characteristic speed $V_c$ appears insensitive to the change of $D_p$ and subsequently
to the normal force. Data from experiments with a sustained contact follow the similar trend. We
have also verified that the normal force shows a dependence on $D_p$ with a Hertzian scaling. Varying
the viscosity $\eta$ by two decades lead to shifts of the speed dependence and we find that $\kappa\equiv\eta
U$ provides a good collapse of data, in consistence with prior studies. In addition, we study the
fluctuation of tangential force over time. We have found that prominent stick-slip patterns occur
only at sufficiently high driving speeds. The change of pattern suggests a change from a regime with
sustained solid-to-solid contact, to that of mixed lubrication where the direct contact is intermittent.
Detailed analyses on the fluctuations reveal a high sensitivity to surface condition, presumably
due to factors such as long-time absorption of molecules, the effects of wearing, or a combination
of both.

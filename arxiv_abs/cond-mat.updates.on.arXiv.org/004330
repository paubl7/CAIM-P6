We present deposition and characterization of multilayers consisting of 20 repetitions of 15 $\r{A}$
thick permalloy Ni$_{80}$Fe$_{20}$ at. \% (Py) and 5 $\r{A}$ Pt. The samples were prepared by two
different sputter deposition methods, namely dc magnetron sputtering (dcMS) and high power impulse
magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS), that represent low and moderate ionized flux fraction of the film
forming material, respectively, for deposition of the Py layers. The effect of substrate roughness,
working gas pressure and sputter power on the in-plane uniaxial magnetic anisotropy of the films
are studied. The multilayers were characterized by X-ray reflectivity and diffraction, and by
magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE). It is shown that HiPIMS deposition produces multilayers with
unique surface roughness regardless of the substrate surface roughness. Multilayers prepared
by both dcMS and HiPIMS deposition present a strong (111) texture normal to the film plane. The results
show that utilizing HiPIMS for deposition of the Py layer leads to a minimum interface mixing between
individual layers compared to dcMS deposition performed at sputter power. This is associated with
the smooth surface of Py deposited by HiPIMS. However, this sharp interface results in higher coercivity
and an opening in the hard axis hysteresis loops while multilayers with intermixing present well
defined in-plane uniaxial anisotropy i.e. a linear hard axis. Comparison with Py/Cu and Py/CuPt
multilayers, prepared under identical conditions using HiPIMS, suggests that poor in-plane uniaxial
anisotropy is obtained in the Py/Pt case, caused by the inverse magnetostriction arising from the
large lattice mismatch between Py and Pt. The Py/Pt multilayers that exhibit interface mixing have
a more relaxed interface and thus presents negligible inverse magnetostriction and have better
defined anisotropy.

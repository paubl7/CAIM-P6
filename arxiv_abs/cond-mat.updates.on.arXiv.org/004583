The electronic properties of transition-metal oxides with highly correlated electrons are of
central importance in modern condensed matter physics and chemistry, both for their fundamental
scientific interest, and for their potential for advanced electronic applications. The design
of materials with tailored properties has been, however, restricted by the limited understanding
of their structure-property relationships, which are particularly complex in the proximity of
the regime where localized electrons become gradually mobile. RENiO3 perovskites, characterized
by the presence of spontaneous metal to insulator transitions, are one of the most widely used model
materials for the investigation of this region in theoretical studies. However, crucial experimental
information needed to validate theoretical predictions is still lacking due to their challenging
high-pressure synthesis, which has prevented to date the growth of sizable bulk single crystals
with RE different than La, Pr and Nd. Here we report the first successful growth of single crystals
with RE = Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, Y, Ho, Er and Lu and sizes up to ~75 {\mu}m, grown from molten salts in temperature
gradient under 2000 bar oxygen gas pressure. The crystals display regular prismatic shapes with
flat facets, and their crystal structures, metal-insulator and antiferromagnetic order transition
temperatures are in excellent agreement with previously reported values obtained from polycrystalline
samples. The availability of such crystals opens access to measurements that have hitherto been
impossible to conduct. This should contribute to a better understanding of the fascinating properties
of materials with highly correlated electrons, and guide future efforts to engineer transition
metal oxides with tailored functional properties.

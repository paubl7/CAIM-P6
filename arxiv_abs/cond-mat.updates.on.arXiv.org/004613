Bimetallic nanoparticles are often superior candidates for a wide range of technological and biomedical
applications, thanks to their enhanced catalytic, optical, and magnetic properties, which are
often better than their monometallic counterparts. Most of their properties strongly depend on
their chemical composition, crystallographic structure, and phase distribution. However, little
is known of how their crystal structure, on the nanoscale, transforms over time at elevated temperatures,
even though this knowledge is highly relevant in case nanoparticles are used in, e.g., high-temperature
catalysis. Au-Fe is a promising bimetallic system where the low-cost and magnetic Fe is combined
with catalytically active and plasmonic Au. Here, we report on the in situ temporal evolution of
the crystalline ordering in Au-Fe nanoparticles, obtained from a modern laser ablation in liquids
synthesis. Our in-depth analysis, complemented by dedicated atomistic simulations, includes
a detailed structural characterization by X-ray diffraction and transmission electron microscopy
as well as atom probe tomography to reveal elemental distributions down to a single atom resolution.
We show that the Au-Fe nanoparticles initially exhibit highly complex internal nested nanostructures
with a wide range of compositions, phase distributions, and size-depended microstrains. The elevated
temperature induces a diffusion-controlled recrystallization and phase merging, resulting
in the formation of a single face-centered-cubic ultrastructure in contact with a body-centered
cubic phase, which demonstrates the metastability of these structures. Uncovering these unique
nanostructures with nested features could be highly attractive from a fundamental viewpoint as
they could give further insights into the nanoparticle formation mechanism under non-equilibrium
conditions.

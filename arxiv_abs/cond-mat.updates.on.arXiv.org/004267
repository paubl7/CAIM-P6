Here we numerically solve the equations derived in part I of this two-part series and verify their
validity. In particular we use the functional Renormalisation Group (fRG) flow equations to obtain
effective potentials for initially highly anharmonic and non-polynomial potentials, including
potentials with multiple trapping wells and barriers, and at different temperatures. The numerical
computations determining the effective action are much faster than the direct simulation of the
stochastic dynamics to which we compare our fRG results. We benchmark our numerical solutions to
the flow equations by comparing the first two equilibrium cumulants from the fRG against the Boltzmann
distribution. We obtain excellent agreement between the two methods demonstrating that numerical
solutions for the effective potential can be accurately obtained in all the highly unharmonic cases
we examined. We then assess the utility of the effective potential to describe the equilibrium 2-point
correlation function $\langle x(0)x(t) \rangle$ and the relevant correlation time. We find that
when Wavefunction Renormalisation is also utilized, these are obtained to percent accuracy for
temperatures down to the typical height of the potentials' barriers but accuracy is quickly lost
for lower temperatures. We also show how the fRG can offer strong agreement with direct numerical
simulation of the nonequilibrium evolution of average position and variance. Also, the fRG solution
represents the whole ensemble average, further adding to its convenience over other techniques,
such as direct numerical simulations or solving the Fokker-Planck diffusion equation, which require
multiple solutions with different initial conditions to construct averages over an ensemble.

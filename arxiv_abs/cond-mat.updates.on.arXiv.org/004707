The frequencies of the analytic normal modes for N identical particles are studied as a function
of system parameters from the weakly interacting BCS regime to the strongly interacting unitary
regime. The normal modes were obtained previously from a first-order L=0 group theoretic solution
of a three-dimensional Hamiltonian with a general two-body interaction for confined, identical
particles. In a precursor to this study, the collective behavior of these normal modes was investigated
as a function of N from few-body systems to many-body systems analyzing the contribution of individual
particles to the collective macroscopic motions. A specific case, the Hamiltonian for Fermi gases
in the unitary regime was studied in more detail. This regime is known to support collective behavior
in the form of superfluidity and has previously been successfully described using normal modes.
Two phenomena that could sustain the emergence and stability of superfluid behavior were revealed,
including the behavior of the normal mode frequencies as N increases. In this paper, I focus on a more
detailed analysis of these analytic frequencies, extending my investigation to include Hamiltonians
with a range of interparticle interaction strengths from the BCS regime to the unitary regime and
analyzing the microscopic dynamics that lead to large gaps at unitarity. The results of the current
study suggest that in regimes where higher-order effects are small, normal modes an be used to describe
the physics of superfluidity from the weakly interacting BCS regime with the emergence of small
excitation gaps to unitarity with its large gaps, and can offer insight into a possible microscopic
understanding of the behavior at unitarity. This approach could thus offer an alternative to the
two-body pairing models commonly used to describe superfluidity along this transition.

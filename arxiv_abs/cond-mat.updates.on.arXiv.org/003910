The persistent motion of bacteria produces clusters with a stationary cluster size distribution
(CSD). Here we develop a minimal model for bacteria in a narrow channel to assess the relative importance
of motility diversity (i.e. polydispersity in motility parameters) and confinement. A mixture
of run-and-tumble particles with a distribution of tumbling rates (denoted generically by $\alpha$)
is considered on a 1D lattice. Particles facing each other cross at constant rate, rendering the
lattice quasi-1D. To isolate the role of diversity, the global average $\alpha$ stays fixed. For
a binary mixture with no particle crossing, the average cluster size ($L_\text{c}$) increases
with the diversity as lower-$\alpha$ particles trap higher-$\alpha$ ones for longer. At finite
crossing rate, particles escape from the clusters sooner, making $L_\text{c}$ smaller and the
diversity less important, even though crossing can enhance demixing of particle types between
the cluster and gas phases. If the crossing rate is increased further, the clusters become controlled
by particle crossing. We also consider an experiment-based continuous distribution of tumbling
rates, revealing similar physics. Using parameters fitted from experiments with Escherichia
coli bacteria, we predict that the error in estimating $L_\text{c}$ without accounting for polydispersity
is around $60\%$. We discuss how to find a binary system with the same CSD as the fully polydisperse
mixture. An effective theory is developed and shown to give accurate expressions for the CSD, the
effective $\alpha$, and the average fraction of mobile particles. We give reasons why our qualitative
results are expected to be valid for other active matter models and discuss the changes that would
result from polydispersity in the active speed rather than in the tumbling rate.

Matrix elements of observables in eigenstates of generic Hamiltonians are described by the Srednicki
ansatz within the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). We study a quantum chaotic spin-fermion
model in a one-dimensional lattice, which consists of a spin-1/2 XX chain coupled to a single itinerant
fermion. In our study, we focus on translationally invariant observables including the charge
and energy current, thereby also connecting the ETH with transport properties. We ask to which extent
one can use autocorrelation functions of observables to extract specific properties of their matrix
elements. Considering observables with a Hilbert-Schmidt norm of one, we first demonstrate the
validity of the ETH ansatz to a remarkable accuracy. A particular emphasis is on the analysis of the
structure of the offdiagonal matrix elements $|\langle \alpha | \hat O | \beta \rangle|^2$ in the
limit of small eigenstate energy differences $\omega = E_\beta - E_\alpha$. Removing the dominant
exponential suppression of $|\langle \alpha | \hat O | \beta \rangle|^2$, we find that: (i) the current
matrix elements, in contrast to all other observables under investigation, exhibit no additional
system-size dependence, (ii) matrix elements of several other observables exhibit a Drude-like
structure with a Lorentzian frequency dependence, whose amplitude and width scales linearly with
the lattice size, eventually suggesting ballistic transport for large systems. We then show how
this information can be extracted from the autocorrelation functions as well. Finally, our study
is complemented by a numerical analysis of the fluctuation-dissipation relation for eigenstates
in the bulk of the spectrum. We identify the regime of $\omega$ in which the well-known fluctuation-dissipation
relation is valid with high accuracy for finite systems.

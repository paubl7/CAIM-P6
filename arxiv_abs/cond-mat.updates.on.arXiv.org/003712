Lithium ion batteries often contain transition metal oxides like Li$_{x}$Mn$_2$O$_4$ ($0\leq
x\leq2$). Depending on the Li content different ratios of Mn$^\text{III}$ to Mn$^\text{IV}$ ions
are present. In combination with electron hopping the Jahn-Teller distortions of the Mn$^\text{III}$O$_6$
octahedra can give rise to complex phenomena like structural transitions and conductance. While
for small model systems oxidation and spin states can be determined using density functional theory
(DFT), the investigation of dynamical phenomena by DFT is too demanding. Previously, we have shown
that a high-dimensional neural network potential can extend molecular dynamics (MD) simulations
of Li$_{x}$Mn$_2$O$_4$ to nanosecond time scales, but these simulations did not provide information
about the electronic structure. Here we extend the use of neural networks to the prediction of atomic
oxidation and spin states. The resulting high-dimensional neural network is able to predict the
spins of the Mn ions with an error of only 0.03 $\hbar$. We find that the Mn e$_\text{g}$ electrons
are correctly conserved and that the number of Jahn-Teller distorted Mn$^\text{III}$O$_6$ octahedra
is predicted precisely for different Li loadings. A charge ordering transition is observed between
280 and 300 K, which matches resistivity measurements. Moreover, the activation energy of the electron
hopping conduction above the phase transition is predicted to be 0.18 eV deviating only 0.02 eV from
experiment. This work demonstrates that machine learning is able to provide an accurate representation
of both, the geometric and the electronic structure dynamics of Li$_x$Mn$_2$O$_4$, on time and
length scales that are not accessible by ab initio MD.

Attaining low resistivity AlGaN layers is the keystone to improve the efficiency of light emitting
devices in the ultraviolet spectral range. Here, we present a microstructural analysis of Ge-doped
AlGaN samples with Al mole fraction from x=0 to 1, and nominal doping level in the range of 1E20 cm-3,
together with the measurement of Ge concentration and its spatial distribution down to the nm scale.
AlGaN:Ge samples with x smaller or equal to 0.2 do not present any sign of inhomogeneity. However,
samples with x > 0.4 display micrometer-size Ge crystallites at the surface. Ge segregation is not
restricted to the surface: Ge-rich regions with a size of tens of nanometers are observed inside
the AlGaN:Ge layers, generally associated with Ga-rich regions around structural defects. With
this local exceptions, the AlGaN:Ge matrix present an homogenous Ge composition which can be significantly
lower than the nominal doping level. Precise measurements of Ge in the matrix provide a view of the
solubility diagram of Ge in AlGaN as a function of the Al mole fraction. The solubility of Ge in AlN
is extremely low. Between AlN and GaN, the solubility increases linearly with the Ga mole fraction
in the ternary alloy, which suggests that the Ge incorporation takes place by substitution of Ga
atoms only. The maximum percentage of Ga sites occupied by Ge saturates around 1%. The solubility
issues and Ge segregation phenomena at different length scales likely play a role in the efficiency
of Ge as n-type AlGaN dopant, even at Al concentrations where Ge DX centers are not expected to manifest.
Therefore, this information can have direct impact in the performance of Ge-doped AlGaN light emitting
diodes, particularly in the spectral range for disinfection (around 260 nm), which requires heavily-doped
alloys with high Al mole fraction.

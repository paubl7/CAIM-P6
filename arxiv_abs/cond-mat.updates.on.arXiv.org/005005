Under external perturbations, inter-particle forces in disordered granular media are well known
to form a heterogeneous distribution with filamentary patterns. Better understanding these forces
and the distribution is important for predicting the collective behavior of granular media, the
media second only to water as the most manipulated material in global industry. However, studies
in this regard so far have been largely confined to granular media exhibiting only geometric heterogeneity,
leaving the dimension of mechanical heterogeneity a rather uncharted area. Here, through a FEM
contact mechanics model, we show that a heterogeneous inter-particle force distribution can also
emerge from the dimension of mechanical heterogeneity alone. Specifically, we numerically study
inter-particle forces in packing of mechanically heterogeneous disks arranged over either a square
or a hexagonal lattice and under quasi-static isotropic compression. Our results show that, a hexagonal
packing exhibit a more heterogeneous inter-particle force distribution than a square packing
does. For both packing lattices, preliminary analysis shows the consistent coexistence of outliers
(i.e., softer disks sustaining larger forces while stiffer disks sustaining smaller forces) in
comparison to their homogeneous counterparts, which implies the existence of nonlocal effect.
Further analysis on the portion of outliers and on spatial contact force correlations suggest that
the hexagonal packing shows more pronounced nonlocal effect over the square packing under small
mechanical heterogeneity. However, such trend is reversed when assemblies becomes more mechanically
heterogeneous. Lastly, we confirm that, in the absence of particle reorganization events, contact
friction merely plays the role of packing stabilization while its variation has little effect on
inter-particle forces and their distribution.

The study of alloys using computational methods has been a difficult task due to the usually unknown
stoichiometry and local atomic ordering of the different structures experimentally. In order
to combat this, first-principles methods have been coupled with statistical methods such as the
Cluster Expansion formalism in order to construct the energy hull diagram, which helps to determine
if an alloyed structure can exist in nature. Traditionally, density functional theory (DFT) has
been used in such workflows. In this work we propose to use chemically accurate many-body variational
Monte Carlo (VMC) and diffusion Monte Carlo (DMC) methods to construct the energy hull diagram of
an alloy system, due to the fact that such methods have a weaker dependence on the starting wavefunction
and density functional, scale similarly to DFT with the number of electrons, and have had demonstrated
success for a variety of materials. To carry out these simulations in a high-throughput manner,
we propose a method called Jastrow sharing, which involves recycling the optimized Jastrow parameters
between alloys with different stoichiometries. We show that this eliminates the need for extra
VMC Jastrow optimization calculations and results in a significant computational cost savings
(on average 1/4 savings of total computational time). Since it is a novel post-transition metal
chalcogenide alloy series that has been synthesized in its few-layer form, we used monolayer $GaS_xSe_{1-x}$
as a case study for our workflow. By extensively testing our Jastrow sharing procedure for monolayer
$GaS_xSe_{1-x}$ and quantifying the cost savings, we demonstrate how a pathway towards chemically
accurate high-throughput simulations of alloys can be achieved using many-body VMC and DMC methods.

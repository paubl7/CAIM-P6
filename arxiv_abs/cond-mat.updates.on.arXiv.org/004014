Recent theoretical and numerical developments supported by observational evidence strongly
suggest that many globular clusters host a black hole (BH) population in their centers. This stands
in contrast to the prior long-standing belief that a BH subcluster would evaporate after undergoing
core collapse and decoupling from the cluster. In this work, we propose that the inhomogeneous Brownian
motion generated by fluctuations of the stellar gravitational field may act as a mechanism adding
a stabilizing pressure to a BH population. We argue that the diffusion equation for Brownian motion
in an inhomogeneous medium with spatially varying diffusion coefficient and temperature, which
was first discovered by Van Kampen, also applies to self-gravitating systems. Applying the stationary
phase space probability distribution to a single BH immersed in a Plummer globular cluster, we infer
that it may wander as far as $\sim 0.05,\,0.1,\,0.5{\rm pc}$ for a mass of $m_{\rm b} \sim 10^3,\,10^2,\,10{\rm
M}_\odot$, respectively. Furthermore, we find that the fluctuations of a fixed stellar mean gravitational
field are sufficient to stabilize a BH population above the Spitzer instability threshold. Nevertheless,
we identify an instability whose onset depends on the Spitzer parameter, $S = (M_{\rm b}/M_\star)
(m_{\rm b}/m_\star)^{3/2} ,$ and parameter $B = \rho_{\rm b}(0) (4\pi r_c^3/M_b)(m_\star/m_{\rm
b})^{3/2} $, where $\rho_{\rm b}(0)$ is the Brownian population central density. For a Plummer
sphere, the instability occurs at $(B,S) = (140,0.25)$. For $B > 140,$ we get very cuspy BH subcluster
profiles that are unstable with regard to the support of fluctuations alone. For $S > 0.25,$ there
is no evidence of any stationary states for the BH population based on the inhomogeneous diffusion
equation.

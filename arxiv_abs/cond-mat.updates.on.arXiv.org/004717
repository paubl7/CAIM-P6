We investigate the spatial distribution of spin orientation in magnetic nanoparticles consisting
of hard and soft magnetic layers. The nanoparticles are synthesized in a core / shell spherical morphology
where the magnetically hard, high anisotropy layer is CoFe$_2$O$_4$ (CFO) while the lower anisotropy
material is Fe$_3$O$_4$ (FO). The nanoparticles have a mean diameter of $\sim$9.2 - 9.6 nm and are
synthesized as two variants: a conventional hard / soft core / shell structure with a CFO core / FO
shell (CFO@FO) and the inverted structure FO core / CFO shell (FO@CFO). High resolution electron
microscopy confirms the coherent spinel structure across the core / shell boundary in both variants
while magnetometry indicates the nanoparticles are superparamagnetic at 300 K and develop a considerable
anisotropy at reduced temperatures. Low temperature \textit{M vs. H} loops suggest a multi-step
reversal process. Temperature dependent small angle neutron scattering (SANS) with full polarization
analysis reveals a strong perpendicular plane alignment of the spins near zero field, indicative
of spin canting, but the perpendicular alignment quickly disappears upon application of a weak
field and little spin ordering parallel to the field until the coercive field is reached. Above the
coercive field of the sample, spins orient predominantly along the field direction. At both zero
field and near saturation, the parallel magnetic SANS peak coincides with the structural peak,
indicating the magnetization is uniform throughout the nanoparticle volume, while near the coercive
field the parallel scattering peak shifts to higher momentum transfer (Q), suggesting that the
coherent scattering volume is smaller and likely originates in the softer Fe$_3$O$_4$ portion
of the nanoparticle.

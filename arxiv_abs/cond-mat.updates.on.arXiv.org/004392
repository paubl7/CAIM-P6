Heterojunction Si solar cells exhibit notable performance degradation. We developed the SolDeg
platform to model this degradation as electronic defects getting generated by thermal activation
across energy barriers over time. First, molecular dynamics simulations were performed to create
a-Si/c-Si stacks, using a machine-learning-based Gaussian approximation potential. Second,
we created shocked clusters by a cluster blaster. Third, the shocked clusters were analyzed to identify
which of them supported electronic defects. Fourth, the distribution of energy barriers that control
the generation of these electronic defects was determined. Fifth, an accelerated Monte Carlo method
was developed to simulate the thermally activated time dependent defect generation across the
barriers. Our main conclusions are as follows. (1) The degradation of a-Si/c-Si stacks via defect
generation is controlled by a broad distribution of energy barriers. (2) We developed the SolDeg
platform to track the microscopic dynamics of defect generation across this wide barrier distribution,
and determined the time dependent defect density $N(t)$ from femtoseconds to gigaseconds, over
24 orders of magnitude in time. (3) We have shown that a stretched exponential analytical form can
successfully describe the defect generation $N(t)$. (4) We found that in relative terms $V_\mathrm{oc}$
degrades at a rate of 0.2%/year over the first year, slowing with advancing time. (5) We developed
the Time Correspondence Curve to calibrate and validate the accelerated testing of solar cells.
We found a compellingly simple scaling relationship between accelerated and normal times $t_\mathrm{accelerated}
\propto t_\mathrm{normal}^{0.85}$. (6) We ourselves carried out experimental studies of defect
generation in a-Si:H/c-Si stacks. We found a relatively high degradation rate at early times, that
slowed considerably at longer time scales.

We study the role of time reversal symmetry (TRS) in the circular photogalvanic (CPG) responses
considering chiral Weyl semimetal (WSM) while a finite CPG response is guaranteed by already broken
inversion symmetry (IS) and mirror symmetries. The TRS broken WSM yields one left and one right chiral
Weyl nodes (WNs) while there are two left and right chiral WNs for TRS invariant WSM. We show that these
features can potentially cause the quantization of CPG response at higher values compared to the
topological charge of the underlying WSM. This is further supported by the fact that Berry curvature
and velocity behave differently whether the system preserves or breaks the TRS. We find that the
quantization in CPG response is twice and four times the topological charge of the activated WNs
for TRS invariant WSM while the quantization is directly given by the topological charge for the
activated WNs in TRS broken case. This clearly suggests that the anti-symmetric behavior of CPG
response between two opposite WNs is lost for TRS invariant system referring to the unique transport
signature of the above systems. Moreover, we find that the tilt can significantly modify the CPG
response as velocity in the tilt direction changes which enters into the CPG tensor through the Fermi
distribution function. Given these exciting outcomes, the second order CPG response emerges as
a useful indicator to characterize the system under consideration. Following the low-energy theory,
we analytically understand the numerical results as obtained from the lattice models. Furthermore,
we investigate the momentum resolved structure of CPG response to relate with the final results
and strengthen our analysis from the perspective of the lattice models.

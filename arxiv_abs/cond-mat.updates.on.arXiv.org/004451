Ferroelectricity in hafnia is often regarded as a breakthrough discovery in ferroelectrics, potentially
able to revolutionize the whole field. Despite increasing interests, a comprehensive understanding
of the many factors driving the ferroelectric stabilization is still lacking. We here address the
phase transition in terms of a Landau-theory-based approach, by analyzing symmetry-allowed distortions
connecting the high-symmetry paraelectric tetragonal phase to the low-symmetry polar orthorhombic
phase. By means of first-principles simulations, we find that the $\Gamma_{3-}$ polar mode is only
weakly unstable, whereas the other two symmetry-allowed distortions, non-polar Y$_{2+}$ and
anti-polar Y$_{4-}$ are hard modes. None of the modes, taken alone or combined with one other mode,
is able to drive the transition: the key factor in stabilizing the polar phase is identified as the
strong trilinear coupling among the three modes. Furthermore, the experimentally acknowledged
importance of substrate-induced effects in the growth of HfO$_2$ ferroelectric thin films, along
with the lack of a clear order parameter in the transition, suggested the extension of our analysis
to strain effects. Our findings suggest a complex behaviour of the Y$_{2+}$ mode, which become unstable
under certain strain conditions and an overall unstable behaviour for the $\Gamma_{3-}$ polar
mode for all the strain states. A robust result emerges from our analysis: independently of the different
applied strain (compressive or tensile, applied along orthorhombic axes), the need of a simultaneous
excitation of the three coupled modes remain unaltered. Finally, when applied to mimic experimental
growth conditions under strain, our analysis show a further stabilization of the ferroelectric
phase with respect to the unstrained case, in agreeement with experimental findings.

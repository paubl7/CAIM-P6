Enhanced room-temperature electromechanical coupling in the lead-free ferroelectric system
$(1-x)$BaZr$_{0.2}$Ti$_{0.8}$O$_{3}$ - $x$Ba$_{0.7}$Ca$_{0.3}$TiO$_{3}$ (abbreviated
as BZCT) at $x=0.5$ is attributed to the existence of a morphotropic phase region (MPR) containing
an intermediate orthorhombic ($O$) phase between terminal rhombohedral ($R$) BZT and tetragonal
($T$) BCT phases. However, there is ambiguity regarding the morphotropic phase transition in BZCT
at room temperature - while some experiments suggest a single $O$ phase within the MPR, others indicate
coexistence of three polar phases ($T+R+O$). Therefore, to understand the thermodynamic stability
of polar phases and its relation to electromechanical switching during morphotropic phase transition
in BZCT, we develop a Landau potential based on the theory of polar anisotropy. Since intrinsic electrostrictive
anisotropy changes as a function of electromechanical processing, we establish a correlation
between the parameters of our potential and the coefficients of electrostriction. We also conducted
phase-field simulations based on this potential to demonstrate changes in domain configuration
from single-phase $O$ to three-phase $T+R+O$ at the equimolar composition with the increase in
electrostrictive anisotropy. Diffusionless phase diagrams and the corresponding piezoelectric
coefficients obtained from our model compare well with the experimental findings. Increase in
electrostrictive anisotropy increases the degeneracy of the free energy at ambient temperature
and pressure leading to decreasing polar anisotropy, although there is an accompanying increase
in the electromechanical anisotropy manifested by an increase in the difference between effective
longitudinal and transverse piezo-coefficients, $d_{33}$ and $d_{31}$.

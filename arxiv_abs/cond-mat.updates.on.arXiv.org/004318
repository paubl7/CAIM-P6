When the charge densities on the inner and outer surface of the vesicle membrane are similar one may
assume that the potential at a point closer to the outer/inner surface is more affected by the charges
located at the outer/inner surface of the vesicle membrane. However, because of the curvature of
the vesicle and the screening effect of the electrolyte ions the situation is more complicated.
When the charge densities at the inner and outer surface of the vesicle membrane are the same then
at any finite distance Z from the center of the vesicle the contribution of the charges, located at
the outer membrane surface, to the vesicle potential Vex is different from the contribution of the
charges, located at the inner membrane surface, to the vesicle potential Vin. At low electrolyte
ion concentrations (from C=0 to 0.00001 [Mol]) Vex/Vin>1 and increases with increasing distance
from the center of the vesicle until the external surface of the vesicle membrane. With further increasing
distance Vex/Vin remains constant at C=0 [Mol], while at C>0 [Mol] it starts decreasing. However,
at high electrolyte ion concentrations (C>0.01 [Mol]) with increasing distance from the center
of the vesicle Vex/Vin reaches its maximum at the internal surface of the vesicle membrane. With
further increasing distance, close to the outer surface of the vesicle Vex/Vin becomes less than
1 (i.e. the charges at the inner surface of the membrane contribute to the potential more than the
charges at the outer surface). Further increasing the distance Vex/Vin reaches its minimum and
then increases to 1 (i.e. the charges at the inner surface of the membrane contribute to the potential
like the charges at the outer surface of the membrane). With increasing electrolyte ion concentration
the minimum of Vex/Vin is getting deeper (approaching zero) and its location is getting closer to
the outer surface of the vesicle.

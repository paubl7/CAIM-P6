We study the occurrence of symmetry-enforced topological band crossings in tetragonal crystals
with strong spin-orbit coupling. By computing the momentum dependence of the symmetry eigenvalues
and the global band topology in the entire Brillouin zone, we determine all symmetry-enforced band
crossings in tetragonal space groups. In particular, we classify all Dirac and Weyl degeneracies
on points, lines, and planes, and find a rich variety of topological degeneracies. This includes,
among others, double Weyl points, fourfold-double Weyl points, fourfold-quadruple Weyl points,
Weyl and Dirac nodal lines, as well as topological nodal planes. For the space groups with symmetry-enforced
Weyl points, we determine the minimal number of Weyl points for a given band pair and, remarkably,
find that materials in space groups 119 and 120 can have band pairs with only two Weyl points in the
entire Brillouin zone. This simplifies the topological responses, which would be useful for device
applications. Using the classification of symmetry-enforced band crossings, we perform an extensive
database search for candidate materials with tetragonal space groups. Notably, we find that Ba$_5$In$_4$Bi$_5$
and NaSn$_5$ exhibit twofold and fourfold Weyl nodal lines, respectively, which cross the Fermi
energy. Hf$_3$Sb and Cs$_2$Tl$_3$ have band pairs with few number of Weyl points near the Fermi energy.
Furthermore, we show that Ba$_3$Sn$_2$ has Weyl points with an accordion dispersion and topological
nodal planes, while AuBr and Tl$_4$PbSe$_3$ possess Dirac points with hourglass dispersions.
For each of these candidate materials we present the ab-initio band structures and discuss possible
experimental signatures of the nontrivial band topology.

Many biological systems synchronize their movement through physical interactions. By far the
most well studied examples concern physical interactions through a fluid: beating cilia, swimming
sperm and worms, and flapping wings, all display synchronization behavior through fluid mechanical
interactions. However, as the density of a collective increases individuals may also interact
with each other through physical contact. In the field of "active matter" systems, it is well known
that inelastic contact between individuals can produce long-range correlations in position,
orientation, and velocity. In this work we demonstrate that contact interactions between undulating
robots yield novel phase dynamics such as synchronized motions. We consider undulatory systems
in which rhythmic motion emerges from time-independent oscillators that sense and respond to undulatory
bending angle and speed. In pair experiments we demonstrate that robot joints will synchronize
to in-phase and anti-phase oscillations through collisions and a phase-oscillator model describes
the stability of these modes. To understand how contact interactions influence the phase dynamics
of larger groups we perform simulations and experiments of simple three-link undulatory robots
that interact only through contact. Collectives synchronize their movements through contact
as predicted by the theory and when the robots can adjust their position in response to contact we
no longer observe anti-phase synchronization. Lastly we demonstrate that synchronization dramatically
reduces the interaction forces within confined groups of undulatory robots indicating significant
energetic and safety benefits from group synchronization. The theory and experiments in this study
illustrate how contact interactions in undulatory active matter can lead to novel collective motion
and synchronization.

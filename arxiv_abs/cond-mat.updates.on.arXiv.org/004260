Motivated by the spin-momentum locking of electrons at the boundaries of topological insulators,
we study a one-dimensional system of spin-orbit coupled massless Dirac electrons with $s$-wave
superconducting pairing. As a result of the spin-orbit coupling, our model has only two kinds of
linearly dispersing modes, which we take to be right-moving spin-up and left-moving spin-down.
Both lattice and continuum models are studied. In the lattice model, we find that a single Majorana
zero energy mode appears at each end of a finite system provided that the $s$-wave pairing has an extended
form, with the nearest-neighbor pairing being larger than the on-site pairing. We confirm this
both numerically and analytically by calculating the winding number. Next we study a lattice version
of a model with both Schr\"odinger and Dirac-like terms and find that the model hosts a topological
transition between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases depending on the relative strength
of the Schr\"odinger and Dirac terms. We then study a continuum system consisting of two $s$-wave
superconductors with different phases of the pairing. Remarkably, we find that the system has a
{\it single} Andreev bound state which is localized at the junction. When the pairing phase difference
crosses a multiple of $2 \pi$, an Andreev bound state touches the top of the superconducting gap and
disappears, and a different state appears from the bottom of the gap. We also study the AC Josephson
effect in such a junction with a voltage bias that has both a constant $V_0$ and a term which oscillates
with a frequency $\omega$. We find that, in contrast to standard Josephson junctions, Shapiro plateaus
appear when the Josephson frequency $\omega_J= 2eV_0/\hbar$ is a rational fraction of $\omega$.
We discuss experiments which can realize such junctions.

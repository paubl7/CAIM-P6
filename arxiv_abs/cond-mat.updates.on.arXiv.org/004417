The transport properties of junctions composed of a central region tunnel coupled to external electrodes
is frequently studied within the single-impurity Anderson model with Hubbard on-site interaction.
In the present work, we supplement the model with an important ingredient, namely the charge-bond
interaction, also known as correlated or assisted hopping. Correlated hopping enters the second-quantised
Hamiltonian, written in the Wannier representation, as an off-diagonal many-body term. Using
the equation of motion technique, we study the effect of the correlated hopping on the spectral and
transport characteristics of a two-terminal quantum dot. Two different Green functions (GFs)
appear: one of them describes the spectral properties of the quantum dot, the other the transport
properties of the system. The calculation of the transport GF requires the knowledge of the spectral
one. We use decoupling procedures similar to those which properly describe the standard Anderson
model within the Kondo regime and outside of it. For an arbitrary ratio $x$ between the amplitudes
of correlated and single-particle hopping terms, the transport GF fulfils the $x \leftrightarrow
2-x$ symmetry of the model. The average occupation of the dot also obeys this symmetry, albeit the
spectral function of the quantum dot, calculated within an analogous decoupling scheme as for the
transport GF, does not. We identify the physical reason for this behaviour, and propose a way to cure
it. Since the correlated-hopping term breaks the particle-hole symmetry of the model and modifies
all transport characteristics of the system, the detailed knowledge of its influence on measurable
characteristics is a prerequisite for its experimental detection. Simple, experimentally feasible
methods are proposed.

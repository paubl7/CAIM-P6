The many-body problem is usually approached from one of two perspectives: the first originates
from an action and is based on Feynman diagrams, the second is centered around a Hamiltonian and deals
with quantum states and operators. The connection between results obtained in either way is made
through spectral (or Lehmann) representations, well known for two-point correlation functions.
Here, we complete this picture by deriving generalized spectral representations for multipoint
correlation functions that apply in all of the commonly used many-body frameworks: the imaginary-frequency
Mastubara and the real-frequency zero-temperature and Keldysh formalisms. Our approach is based
on separating spectral from time-ordering properties and thereby elucidates the relation between
the three formalisms. The spectral representations of multipoint correlation functions consist
of partial spectral functions and convolution kernels. The former are formalism independent but
system specific; the latter are system independent but formalism specific. Using a numerical renormalization
group (NRG) method described in an accompanying paper, we present numerical results for selected
quantum impurity models. We focus on the four-point vertex (effective interaction) obtained for
the single-impurity Anderson model and for the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) solution of
the one-band Hubbard model. In the Matsubara formalism, we analyze the evolution of the vertex down
to very low temperatures and describe the crossover from strongly interacting particles to weakly
interacting quasiparticles. In the Keldysh formalism, we first benchmark our results at weak and
infinitely strong interaction and then reveal the rich real-frequency structure of the DMFT vertex
in the coexistence regime of a metallic and insulating solution.

Sequential infiltration synthesis (SIS) provides a successful route to grow inorganic materials
into polymeric films by penetrating of gaseous precursors into the polymer, both in order to enhance
the functional properties of the polymer creating an organic-inorganic hybrid material, and to
fabricate inorganic nanostructures when infiltrating in patterned polymer films or in selfassembled
block copolymers. A SIS process consists in a controlled sequence of metal organic precursor and
co-reactant vapor exposure cycles of the polymer films in an atomic layer deposition (ALD) reactor.
In this work, we present a study of the SIS process of alumina using trimethylaluminum (TMA) and H2O
in various polymer films using in situ dynamic spectroscopic ellipsometry (SE). In situ dynamic
SE enables time-resolved monitoring of the swelling of the polymer, which is relevant to the diffusion
and retain of the metal precursor into the polymer itself. Different swelling behaviour of poly(methylmethacrylate)
(PMMA) and polystyrene (PS) was observed when exposed to TMA vapor. PMMA films swell more significantly
than PS films do, resulting in very different infiltrated Al2O3 thickness after polymer removal
in O2 plasma. PMMA films reach different swollen states upon TMA exposure and reaction with H2O,
depending on the TMA dose and on the purge duration after TMA exposure, which correspond to different
amounts of metal precursor retained inside the polymer and converted to alumina. Diffusion coefficients
of TMA in PMMA were extracted investigating the swelling of pristine PMMA films during TMA infiltration
and shown to be dependent on polymer molecular weight. In situ dynamic SE monitoring allows to control
the SIS process tuning it from an ALD-like process for long purge to a chemical vapour deposition
- like process selectively confined inside the polymer films

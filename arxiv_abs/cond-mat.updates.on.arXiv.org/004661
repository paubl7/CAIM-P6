Paper holds the promise to replace silicon substrates in applications like internet of things or
disposable electronics that require ultra-low-cost electronic components and an environmentally
friendly electronic waste management. In the last years, spurred by the abovementioned properties
of paper as a substrate and the exceptional electronic, mechanical and optical properties of van
der Waals (vdW) materials, many research groups have worked towards the integration of vdW materials-based
devices on paper. Recently, a method to deposit a continuous film of densely packed interconnects
of vdW materials on paper by simply rubbing the vdW crystals against the rough surface of paper has
been presented. This method utilizes the weak interlayer vdW interactions and allows cleaving
of the crystals into micro platelets through the abrasion against the paper. Here, we aim to illustrate
the general character and the potential of this technique by fabricating films of 39 different vdW
materials (including superconductors, semi-metals, semiconductors, and insulators) on standard
copier paper. We have thoroughly characterized their optical properties showing their high optical
quality: one can easily resolve the absorption band edge of semiconducting vdW materials and even
the excitonic features present in some vdW materials with high exciton binding energy. We also measured
the electrical resistivity for several vdW materials films on paper finding exceptionally low
values, which are in some cases, orders of magnitude lower than those reported for analogous films
produced by inkjet printing. We finally demonstrate the fabrication of field-effect devices with
vdW materials on paper using the paper substrate as an ionic gate.

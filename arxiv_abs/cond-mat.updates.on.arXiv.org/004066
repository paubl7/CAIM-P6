The mechanisms of structure evolution do not obey the Bravais crystal systems in gaseous, semisolid
and solid atoms. To execute confined interstate electron dynamics, atoms under neutral states
deal with the conservative forces. Prior to execute electron dynamics, atoms amalgamate under
attained dynamics. Electrons of the outer rings execute dynamics in the structure evolution of
atoms. In binding atoms, a shape of the binding energy depends on the nature of electron dynamics.
In the atoms of space format, a structure evolves above the ground surface. In the atoms of grounded
format, a structure evolves below the ground surface. The dimensions of structure depend on the
number of electrons simultaneously executing dynamics in atoms. When three electrons of the outer
ring in an atom execute dynamics, a structure of three-dimensional gets evolved. When two or four
electrons of the outer ring in an atom execute dynamics, a structure of two-dimensional or four-dimensional
gets evolved. Amalgamated or amalgamating atoms bind to the targeted atom at the points of their
generated energy. When the structure evolves in the space format, amalgamating atoms bind to the
targeted atom in lateral manner but from the upward side. On the other hand, when the structure evolves
in the grounded format, amalgamating atoms bind to the targeted atom in lateral manner but from the
downward side. Further, when the structure evolves in the surface format, amalgamating atoms bind
to the targeted atom in adjacent manner. In each format of force, bound atoms of mono layers bind through
chemical force and chemical energy. A chemical reactivity of the involved force and the engaged
energy binds mono layers laterally. The structure evolution discussed here may give new horizon
to material science and chemical science.

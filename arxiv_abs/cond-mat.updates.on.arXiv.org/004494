We report the formation of self-assembled monolayers of a molecular photoswitch (azobenzene-bithiophene
derivative, AzBT) on cobalt via a thiol covalent bond. We study the electrical properties of the
molecular junctions formed with the tip of a conductive atomic force microscope under ultra-high
vacuum. The statistical analysis of the current-voltage curves shows two distinct states of the
molecule conductance, suggesting the coexistence of both the trans and cis azobenzene isomers
on the surface. The cis isomer population (trans isomer) increases (decreases) upon UV light irradiation.
The situation is reversed under blue light irradiation. The experiments are confronted to first-principle
calculations performed on the molecular junctions with the Non-Equilibrium Green's Function
formalism combined with Density Functional Theory (NEGF/DFT). The theoretical results consider
two different molecular orientations for each isomer. Whereas the orientation does not affect
the conductance of the trans isomer, it significantly modulates the conductance of the cis isomer
and the resulting conductance ON/OFF ratio of the molecular junction. This helps identifying the
molecular orientation at the origin of the observed current differences between the trans and cis
forms. The ON state is associated to the trans isomer irrespective of its orientation in the junction,
while the OFF state is identified as a cis isomer with its azobenzene moiety folded upward with respect
to the bithiophene core. The experimental and calculated ON/OFF conductance ratios have a similar
order of magnitude. This conductance ratio seems reasonable to make these Co-AzBT molecular junctions
a good test-bed to further explore the relationship between the spin-polarized charge transport,
the molecule conformation and the molecule-Co spinterface.

Spin Waves(SWs) enable the realization of energy efficient circuits as they propagate and interfere
within waveguides without consuming noticeable energy. However, SW computing can be even more
energy efficient by taking advantage of the approximate computing paradigm as many applications
are error-tolerant like multimedia and social media. In this paper we propose an ultra-low energy
novel Approximate Full Adder(AFA) and a 2-bit inputs Multiplier(AMUL). We validate the correct
functionality of our proposal by means of micromagnetic simulations and evaluate the approximate
FA figure of merit against state-of-the-art accurate SW, 7nmCMOS, Spin Hall Effect(SHE), Domain
Wall Motion(DWM), accurate and approximate 45nmCMOS, Magnetic Tunnel Junction(MTJ), and Spin-CMOS
FA implementations. Our results indicate that AFA consumes 43% and 33% less energy than state-of-the-art
accurate SW and 7nmCMOS FA, respectively, and saves 69% and 44% when compared with accurate and approximate
45nm CMOS, respectively, and provides a 2 orders of magnitude energy reduction when compared with
accurate SHE, accurate and approximate DWM, MTJ, and Spin-CMOS, counterparts. In addition, it
achieves the same error rate as approximate 45nmCMOS and Spin-CMOS FA whereas it exhibits 50% less
error rate than the approximate DWM FA. Furthermore, it outperforms its contenders in terms of area
by saving at least 29% chip real-estate. AMUL is evaluated and compared with state-of-the-art accurate
SW and 16nm CMOS accurate and approximate state-of-the-art designs. The evaluation results indicate
that it saves at least 2x and 5x energy in comparison with the state-of-the-art SW designs and 16nm
CMOS accurate and approximate designs, respectively, and has an average error rate of 10%, while
the approximate CMOS MUL has an average error rate of 13%, and requires at least 64% less chip real-estate.

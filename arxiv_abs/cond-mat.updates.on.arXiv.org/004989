Ferromagnetic spin valves offer the key building blocks to integrate giant- and tunneling-magnetoresistance
effects into spintronics devices. Starting from a generalized Blonder--Tinkham--Klapwijk approach,
we theoretically investigate the impact of interfacial Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings
on the tunneling conductance, and thereby the tunneling-magnetoresistance characteristics,
of ferromagnet/superconductor/ferromagnet spin-valve junctions embedding thin superconducting
spacers between the either parallel or antiparallel magnetized ferromagnets. We focus on the unique
interplay between usual electron tunnelings -- that fully determine the tunneling magnetoresistance
in the normal-conducting state -- and the peculiar Andreev reflections in the superconducting
state. In the presence of interfacial spin-orbit couplings, special attention needs to be paid
to the spin-flip ("unconventional") Andreev-reflection process that is expected to induce superconducting
triplet correlations in proximitized regions. As a transport signature of these triplet pairings,
we detect conductance double-peaks around the singlet-gap energy, reflecting the competition
between the singlet and the newly emerging triplet gap. We thoroughly analyze the Andreev reflections'
role in connection with superconducting tunneling-magnetoresistance phenomena, and eventually
unravel huge conductance and tunneling-magnetoresistance magnetoanisotropies -- easily exceeding
their normal-state counterparts by several orders of magnitude -- as another experimentally accessible
fingerprint of unconventional Andreev reflections. Our results provide an important contribution
to establish superconducting magnetic spin valves as an essential ingredient for future superconducting-spintronics
concepts.

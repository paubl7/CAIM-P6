Coupling a system to a nonthermal environment can profoundly affect the phase diagram of the closed
system, giving rise to a special class of dissipation-induced phase transitions. Such transitions
take the system out of its ground state and stabilize a higher-energy stationary state, rendering
it the sole attractor of the dissipative dynamics. In this work, we present a unifying methodology,
which we use to characterize this ubiquitous phenomenology and its implications for the open system
dynamics. Specifically, we analyze the closed system's phase diagram, including symmetry-broken
phases, and explore their corresponding excitations' spectra. Opening the system, the environment
can overwhelm the system's symmetry-breaking tendencies, and changes its order parameter. As
a result, isolated distinct phases of similar order become connected, and new phase-costability
regions appear. Interestingly, the excitations differ in the newly-connected regions through
a change in their symplectic norm, which is robust to the introduction of dissipation. As a result,
by tuning the system from one phase to the other across the dissipation-stabilized region, the open
system fluctuations exhibit an exceptional point-like scenario, where the fluctuations become
overdamped, only to reappear with an opposite sign in the dynamical response function of the system.
The overdamped region is also associated with squeezing of the fluctuations. We demonstrate the
pervasive nature of such dissipation-induced phenomena in two prominent examples, namely in parametric
resonators and in light-matter systems. Our work draws a crucial distinction between quantum phase
transitions and their zero-temperature open system counterparts.

The crystal structure of MoS$_2$ with strong covalent bonds in plane and weak Van der Waals interactions
out of plane gives rise to interesting properties for applications such as optoelectronics, solid
lubrication, and catalysis, which can be enhanced by transition-metal doping. However, the mechanisms
for improvement and even the structure of the doped material can be unclear, which we address in this
paper with theoretical calculations. Building on our previous work on Ni-doping of the 2H phase,
now we explore polytypes (1H and 1T monolayers, and 3R bulk), to determine favorable sites for Ni
and the doping effect on crystal structure, electronic properties and the layer dissociation energy.
We find the most favorable intercalation/adatom sites are tetrahedral intercalation for 3R (like
2H), Mo-atop for 1H, and hollow site for 1T. The relative energies indicate a possibility of phase
change from 2H to 3R with substitution of Mo or S. We find metallic behavior in Mo-substituted 3R and
2H, and in-gap states for Mo- and S-substituted 1H, which could have interesting optoelectronic
applications. Doping the 1T phase resulted in reconstructions leading to a metal-semiconductor
transition. We find a large enhancement in the interlayer interactions of Ni-doped MoS$_2$, opposite
to the effect of other transition metals. For lubrication applications, this increased layer dissociation
energy could be the mechanism of low wear. Our systematic study shows the effect of doping concentration
and is extrapolated to the low-doping limit. This work gives insight into the previously unclear
structure of Ni-doped MoS$_2$ and how it can be detected experimentally, the relation of energy
and structures of doped monolayers and bulk systems, the electronic properties under doping, and
the effect of doping on interlayer interactions.

Nanomaterials made of the cerium oxides CeO$_2$ and Ce$_2$O$_3$ have a broad range of applications,
from catalysts in automotive, industrial or energy operations to promising materials to enhance
hadrontherapy effectiveness in oncological treatments. To elucidate the physico-chemical mechanisms
involved in these processes, it is of paramount importance to know the electronic excitation spectra
of these oxides, which are obtained here through high-accuracy linear-response time-dependent
density functional theory calculations. In particular, the macroscopic dielectric response
functions $\bar\epsilon$ of both bulk CeO$_2$ and Ce$_2$O$_3$ are derived, which compare remarkably
well with the available experimental data. These results stress the importance of appropriately
accounting for local field effects to model the dielectric function of metal oxides. Furthermore,
we reckon the materials energy loss functions $\mbox{Im} (-1/\bar{\epsilon})$, including the
accurate evaluation of the momentum transfer dispersion from first-principles. In this respect,
by using a Mermin-type parametrization we are able to model the contribution of different electronic
excitations to the dielectric loss function. Finally, from the knowledge of the electron inelastic
mean free path, together with the elastic mean free path provided by the relativistic Mott theory,
we carry out statistical Monte Carlo (MC) charge transport simulations to reproduce the major features
of the reported experimental reflection electron energy loss (REEL) spectra of cerium oxides.
The good agreement with REEL experimental data strongly supports our approach based on MC modelling
informed by ab initio calculated electronic excitation spectra in a broad range of momentum and
energy transfers.

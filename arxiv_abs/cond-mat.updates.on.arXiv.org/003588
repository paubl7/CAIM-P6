Optical absorption and emission spectra of doped two-dimensional (2D) materials exhibit sharp
peaks that are often identified with pure excitons and pure trions (or charged excitons), but both
peaks have been recently attributed to superpositions of 2-body exciton and 4-body trion states
(or exciton-polaron states) and correspond to the approximate energy eigenstates in doped 2D materials.
In this paper, we present the radiative lifetimes of these exciton-trion superposition energy
eigenstates using a many-body formalism that is appropriate given the many-body nature of the strongly
coupled exciton and trion states in doped 2D materials. Whereas the exciton component of these superposition
eigenstates are optically coupled to the material ground state, and can emit a photon and decay into
the material ground state provided the momentum of the eigenstate is within the light cone, the trion
component is optically coupled only to the excited states of the material and can emit a photon even
when the momentum of the eigenstate is outside the light cone. In an electron-doped 2D material,
when a 4-body trion state with momentum outside the light cone recombines radiatively, and a photon
is emitted with a momentum inside the light cone, the excess momentum is taken by an electron-hole
pair left behind in the conduction band. The radiative lifetimes of the exciton-trion superposition
states, with momenta inside the light cone, are found to be in the few hundred femtoseconds to a few
picoseconds range and are strong functions of the doping density. The radiative lifetimes of exciton-trion
superposition states, with momenta outside the light cone, are in the few hundred picoseconds to
a few nanoseconds range and are again strongly dependent on the doping density.

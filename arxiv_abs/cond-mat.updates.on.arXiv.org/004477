Structural materials are broadly used in applications such as nuclear vessels, high-temperature
processes, and civil construction. Usually, during their placing and lifespan, they may present
free or chemically bonded liquid phases in their structure, demanding careful attention when exposed
to high heating rates. Their behavior in such conditions is a challenging problem as it comprises
numerous highly nonlinear properties (not easily measured via experimental tests), strongly
coupled equations and unreliable experimental benchmarks. Nonetheless, such simulations are
of great interest. This work aims to provide a numerical study, checking whether its solution indeed
converges and yields reliable results. Additionally, as the model needs several input parameters,
this work conducts a sensitivity analysis and also assesses its applicability to more complex scenarios,
as such issues remain open in the literature. In order to do that, a simple model that can be easily
adapted for mixed formulations and complex geometries was proposed. It was found out that when considering
unidimensional models the choices regarding the interpolation of the sorption isotherms are not
essential to the numerical stability of the system. Besides that, the permeability and thermal
conductivity of the material are the most important parameters that affect the simulation results
of pressure, temperature and evaporable water content profiles. Finally, the 2D mesoscale simulation
of concrete with polymeric fibers (based on the mixed formulation of the problem) yielded results
that agreed with experimental observations. Thus, the model proposed herein can provide a solid
base for future works and also important insights towards simpler methodologies.

Determination of the symmetry property of superconducting gaps has been a central issue in studies
to understand the mechanisms of unconventional superconductivity. Although it is often difficult
to completely achieve the aforementioned goal, the existence of superconducting nodes, one of
the few important experimental signatures of unconventional superconductivity, plays a vital
role in exploring the possibility of unconventional superconductivity. The interplay between
superconducting nodes and topology has been actively investigated, and intensive research in
the past decade has revealed various intriguing nodes out of the scope of the pioneering work to classify
superconducting order parameters based on the point groups. However, a systematic and unified
description of superconducting nodes for arbitrary symmetry settings is still elusive. In this
paper, we develop a systematic framework to comprehensively classify superconducting nodes pinned
to any line in momentum space. While most previous studies have been based on the homotopy theory,
our theory is on the basis of the symmetry-based analysis of band topology, which enables systematic
diagnoses of nodes in all nonmagnetic and magnetic space groups. Furthermore, our framework can
readily provide a highly effective scheme to detect nodes in a given superconductor by using density
functional theory and assuming symmetry properties of Cooper pairs (called pairing symmetries),
which can reduce candidates of pairing symmetries. We substantiate the power of our method through
the time-reversal broken and noncentrosymmetric superconductor CaPtAs. Our work establishes
a unified theory for understanding superconducting nodes and facilitates determining superconducting
gaps in materials combined with experimental observations.

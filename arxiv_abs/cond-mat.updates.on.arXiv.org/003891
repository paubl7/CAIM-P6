Order parameters are key to our understanding of phases of matter. Not only do they allow to classify
phases, but they also enable the study of phase transitions through their critical exponents which
identify the universal long-range physics underlying the transition. Topological phases are
exotic quantum phases which are lacking the characterization in terms of order parameters. While
probes have been developed to identify such phases, those probes are only qualitative in that they
take discrete values, and thus provide no means to study the scaling behavior in the vicinity of phase
transitions. In this paper, we develop a framework based on variational tensor networks (infinite
Projected Entangled Pair States, or iPEPS) for the quantitative study of topological phase transitions
through topological order parameters. These order parameters allow to quantitatively probe the
behavior through a phase transition and thus to identify universal signatures of topological phase
transitions. We apply our framework to the study of the Toric Code model in different magnetic fields,
which along some special lines maps to the (2+1)D Ising model. Our method identifies 3D Ising critical
exponents for the entire transition, consistent with those special cases and general belief. However,
we in addition also find a novel critical exponent $\beta^*\approx 0.02$ for one of our topological
order parameters, which we relate to disorder parameters in the 3D Ising model. This shows that our
topological order parameters can provide additional means to characterize the universal data
at topological phase transitions, and altogether demonstrates the power of this framework to microscopically
study topological phase transitions and identify the universal data underlying the transition.

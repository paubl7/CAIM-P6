Polarization switching mechanisms in ferroelectric materials are fundamentally linked to local
domain structure and presence of the structural defects, which both can act as nucleation and pinning
centers and create local electrostatic and mechanical depolarization fields affecting wall dynamics.
However, the general correlative mechanisms between domain structure and polarization dynamics
are only weakly explored, precluding insight into the associated physical mechanisms. Here, the
correlation between local domain structures and switching behavior in ferroelectric materials
is explored using the convolutional encoder-decoder networks, enabling image to spectral (im2spec)
and spectral to image (spec2im) translations via encoding latent variables. The latter reflect
the assumption that the relationship between domain structure and polarization switching is parsimonious,
i.e. is based upon a small number of local mechanisms. The analysis of latent variables distributions
and their real space representations provides insight into the predictability of the local switching
behavior, and hence associated physical mechanisms. We further pose that the regions where these
correlative relationships are violated, i.e. predictability of the polarization dynamics from
domain structure is reduced, represent the obvious target for detailed studies, e.g. in the context
of automated experiments. This approach provides a workflow to establish the presence of correlation
between local spectral responses and local structure, and can be universally applied to spectral
imaging techniques such as PFM, scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy, and electron
energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). The interactive

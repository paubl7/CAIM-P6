Earth-abundant two-dimensional (2D) pristine transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have
emerged as a superlative class of materials for several applications in electronic devices, energy
storage devices, gas sensing, etc., and they have recently attracted great attention, owing to
their good catalytic activity and excellent stability toward electrochemical H2 Evolution Reaction
(HER). Each individual layer of the TMDs consists of three atomic layers in which the transition
metal is sandwiched by two chalcogens. To activate the inert basal plane of the pristine 2D TMDs,
it is needed to create some defects or doping of some heteroatoms in the pristine TMDs. Phase engineering
techniques have been used to activate the basal plane of the 2D TMDs. In this article, we have computationally
developed 2D monolayer Mn-MoS$_2$ material and its application in HER. Stable S terminated edge
of the MoS$_2$ shows low catalytic activity due to its inert basal plane, so to exploit these edges
for improved performance we doped Mn in the pristine MoS$_2$ material. Using trailblazing and state
of the art first principles-based density functional theory we performed methodical and rigorous
inspection of electronic structures and properties of monolayer Mn doped MoS$_2$ to be a promising
alternative to noble metal-based catalysts for HER. Periodic 2D slab of Mn-MoS$_2$ was created
to study the electronic properties and the reaction pathway occurring on the surface of the material
has been delved into by creating Mn$_1$Mo$_9$S$_{21}$ molecular cluster model. Our study reveals
that the 2D Mn-MoS$_2$ monolayer based catalyst follows the Volmer-Heyrovsky reaction with very
low energy barriers during the HER mechanism. This study is focused on designing a low cost and efficient
electrocatalyst for HER by using earth abundant TMDs and lowering the activation barriers by scrutinizing
the kinetics of the reaction for reactivity.

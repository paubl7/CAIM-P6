The exact study of small systems can guide us toward measures for extracting information about many-body
physics as we move to more complex systems capable of quantum information processing or quantum
analog simulation. We use exact diagonalization to study many electrons in short 1-D atom chains
represented by long-range extended Hubbard-like models. We introduce a novel measure, the Single-Particle
Excitation Content (SPEC) of an eigenstate and show that the dependence of SPEC on state number reveals
the nature of the ground state, and the onset and saturation of correlation between the electrons
as Coulomb interaction strength increases. We use this SPEC behavior to identify five regimes as
interaction is increased: a non-interacting single-particle regime, a regime of perturbative
Coulomb interaction in which the SPEC is a nearly universal function of state number, the onset and
saturation of correlation, a regime of fully correlated states in which hopping is a perturbation
and SPEC is a different universal function of state number, and the regime of no hopping. In particular,
the behavior of the SPEC shows that when electron-electron correlation plays a minor role, all of
the lowest energy states are made up primarily of single-particle excitations of the ground state,
and as the Coulomb interaction increases, the lowest energy states increasingly contain many-particle
excitations. In addition, the SPEC highlights a fundamental, distinct difference between a non-interacting
system and one with minute, very weak interactions. While SPEC is a quantity that can be calculated
for small exactly diagonalizable systems, it guides our intuition for larger systems, suggesting
the nature of excitations and their distribution in the spectrum. Thus, this function, like correlation
functions or order parameters, provides us with a window of intuition about the behavior of a physical
system.

The ruthenium content of half-metallic Mn$_2$Ru$_x$Ga thin films with a biaxially-strained inverse
Heusler structure influences the ferrimagnetism that determines their magnetic and electronic
properties. An extensive study of Mn$_y$Ru$_x$Ga films on MgO (100) substrates with $1.8 \leq y
\leq 2.6$ and $x$ = 0.5, 0.7 or 0.9, including crystallographic and magnetic order, magneto-transport
and spin polarisation is undertaken to map specific composition-dependent properties in this
versatile ternary system. A comparison of the experimental densities with calculated X-ray densities
for alloys with Mn or Ru vacancies exhibit full site occupancy which indicates the presence of chemical
disorder. All compositions studied except $x = 0.5$, $y = 2.2$ exhibit compensation. Increasing
the Mn or Ru content raises the compensation temperature but increasing Ru decreases the spin polarisation
determined by Andreev reflection. Molecular field theory is used to model the temperature dependence
of the net ferrimagnetic moment obtained from magnetisation measurements and three principal
exchange coefficients are deduced. Marked differences in the shape of anomalous Hall and net magnetisation
hysteresis loops are explained by canting of the net moment relative to the c-axis in zero field,
which results from non-collinearity of the Mn$^{4c}$ sublattice moments due to competing intra-sublattice
exchange interactions. Consequences of the non-collinearity are reduced spin polarisation and
an intrinsic contribution to the anomalous Hall effect. Our systematic investigation of the physical
properties as a function of $x$ and $y$ will permit the selection of compositions that best match
the requirements of any particular application.

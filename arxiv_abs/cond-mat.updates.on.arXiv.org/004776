Physically, disordered ensembles of non-homopolymeric polypeptides are expected to be heterogeneous;
i.e., they should differ from those homogeneous ensembles of homopolymers that harbor an essentially
unique relationship between average values of end-to-end distance $R_{\rm EE}$ and radius of gyration
$R_{\rm g}$. It was posited recently, however, that small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) data on
conformational dimensions of disordered proteins can be rationalized almost exclusively by homopolymer
ensembles. Assessing this perspective, chain-model simulations are used to evaluate the discriminatory
power of SAXS-determined molecular form factors (MFFs) with regard to homogeneous versus heterogeneous
ensembles. The general approach adopted here is not bound by any assumption about ensemble encodability,
in that the postulated heterogeneous ensembles we evaluated are not restricted to those entailed
by simple interaction schemes. Our analysis of MFFs for certain heterogeneous ensembles with more
narrowly distributed $R_{\rm EE}$ and $R_{\rm g}$ indicates that while they deviates from MFFs
of homogeneous ensembles, the differences can be rather small. Remarkably, some heterogeneous
ensembles with asphericity and $R_{\rm EE}$ drastically different from those of homogeneous ensembles
can nonetheless exhibit practically identical MFFs, demonstrating that SAXS MFFs do not afford
unique characterizations of basic properties of conformational ensembles in general. In other
words, the ensemble to MFF mapping is practically many-to-one and likely non-smooth. Heteropolymeric
variations of the $R_{\rm EE}$--$R_{\rm g}$ relationship were further showcased using an analytical
perturbation theory developed here for flexible heteropolymers. Ramifications of our findings
for interpretation of experimental data are discussed.

We consider two-dimensional $q$-state quantum clock models with quantum fluctuations connecting
states with all-to-all clock transitions with different matrix elements, including the case of
transitions restricted to only the nearest clock states. We study the quantum phase transitions
in these models with the aim of characterizing the cross-over from emergent U(1) symmetry at the
transition (for $q \ge 4$) to $Z_q$ symmetry of the ordered state. As in classical three-dimensional
clock models, the cross-over is governed by a dangerously irrelevant operator with scaling dimension
$\Delta_q>3$. We specifically study $q=5,6$ models with different forms of the quantum fluctuations
and different anisotropies in the classical models. In all cases studied, we find consistency with
the expected classical XY critical exponents related to the conventional order parameter as well
as the scaling dimensions $\Delta_q$. However, the initial weak violation of the U(1) symmetry
in the ordered phase, characterized by an angular $Z_q$ symmetric order parameter $\phi_q$, scales
with the system size in an unexpected way. As a function of the system size (length) $L$ in the close
neighborhood of the critical temperature, $\phi_q \propto L^p$, where the known value of the exponent
is $p=2$ in the classical isotropic XY model. In contrast, for strongly anisotropic XY models and
all the quantum models studied, we observe $p=3$. For weakly anisotropic models we observe a cross-over
from $p=2$ to $p=3$ scaling. The exponent $p$ also directly impacts the exponent $\nu'$ characterizing
the divergence of the U(1)length scale $\xi'$ in the thermodynamic limit, according to the general
relationship $\nu'=\nu(1+|y_q|/p)$, where $y_q=3-\Delta_q$ is the scaling dimension of the
clock field. We present a phenomenological argument for the $p=3$.

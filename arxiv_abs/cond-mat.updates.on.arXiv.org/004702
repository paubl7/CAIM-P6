We model the nonlinear response of a lubricated contact composed of a two-dimensional lipid membrane
immersed in a simple fluid between two parallel flat and porous walls under shear. The nonlinear
dynamics of the membrane gives rise to a rich dynamical behavior depending on the shear velocity.
In quiescent conditions (i.e., absence of shear), the membrane freezes into a disordered labyrinthine
wrinkle pattern. In the presence of shear, we find four different regimes depending on the shear
rate. Regime I. For small shear, the labyrinthine pattern is still frozen, but exhibits a small drift
which is mainly along the shear direction. In this regime, the tangential forces on the walls due
to the presence of the membrane increase linearly with the shear rate. Regime II. When the shear rate
is increased above a critical value, the membrane rearranges, and wrinkles start to align along
the shear direction. This regime is accompanied by a sharp drop of the tangential forces on the wall.
Regime III. For larger shear rates, the wrinkles align strongly along the shear direction, with
a set of dislocation defects which assemble in pairs. The tangential forces are then controlled
by the number of dislocations, and by the number of wrinkles between the two dislocations within
each dislocation pairs. In this dislocation-dominated regime, the tangential forces in the transverse
direction most often exceed those in the shear direction. Regime IV. For even larger shear, the membrane
organizes into a perfect array of parallel stripes with no defects. The wavelength of the wrinkles
is still identical to the wavelength in the absence of shear. In this final regime, the tangential
forces due to the membrane vanish. These behaviors give rise to a non-linear rheological behavior
of lubricated contacts containing membranes.

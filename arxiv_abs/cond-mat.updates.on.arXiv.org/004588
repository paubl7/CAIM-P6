A wide variety of new phenomena such as novel magnetization configurations have been predicted
to occur in three dimensional magnetic nanostructures. However, the fabrication of such structures
is often challenging due to the specific shapes required, such as magnetic tubes and spirals. Furthermore,
the materials currently used to assemble these structures are predominantly magnetic metals that
do not allow to study the magnetic response of the system separately from the electronic one. In the
field of spintronics, the prototypical material used for such experiments is the ferrimagnetic
insulator yttrium iron garnet (Y$_3$Fe$_5$O$_{12}$, YIG). YIG is one of the best materials especially
for magnonic studies due to its low Gilbert damping. Here, we report the first successful fabrication
of YIG thin films via atomic layer deposition. To that end we utilize a supercycle approach based
on the combination of sub-nanometer thin layers of the binary systems Fe$_2$O$_3$ and Y$_2$O$_3$
in the correct atomic ratio on Y$_3$Al$_5$O$_{12}$ substrates with a subsequent annealing step.
Our process is robust against typical growth-related deviations, ensuring a good reproducibility.
The ALD-YIG thin films exhibit a good crystalline quality as well as magnetic properties comparable
to other deposition techniques. One of the outstanding characteristics of atomic layer deposition
is its ability to conformally coat arbitrarily-shaped substrates. ALD hence is the ideal deposition
technique to grant an extensive freedom in choosing the shape of the magnetic system. The atomic
layer deposition of YIG enables the fabrication of novel three dimensional magnetic nanostructures,
which in turn can be utilized for experimentally investigating the phenomena predicted in those
structures.

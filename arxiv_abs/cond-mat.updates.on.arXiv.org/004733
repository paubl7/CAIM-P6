Nonlinear mechanics of solids is an exciting field that encompasses both beautiful mathematics,
such as the emergence of instabilities and the formation of complex patterns, as well as multiple
applications. Two-dimensional crystals and van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures allow revisiting
this field on the atomic level, allowing much finer control over the parameters and offering atomistic
interpretation of experimental observations. In this work, we consider the formation of instabilities
consisting of radially-oriented wrinkles around mono- and few-layer "bubbles" in two-dimensional
vdW heterostructures. Interestingly, the shape and wavelength of the wrinkles depend not only
on the thickness of the two-dimensional crystal forming the bubble, but also on the atomistic structure
of the interface between the bubble and the substrate, which can be controlled by their relative
orientation. We argue that the periodic nature of these patterns emanates from an energetic balance
between the resistance of the top membrane to bending, which favors large wavelength of wrinkles,
and the membrane-substrate vdW attraction, which favors small wrinkle amplitude. Employing the
classical "Winkler foundation" model of elasticity theory, we show that the number of radial wrinkles
conveys a valuable relationship between the bending rigidity of the top membrane and the strength
of the vdW interaction. Armed with this relationship, we use our data to demonstrate a nontrivial
dependence of the bending rigidity on the number of layers in the top membrane, which shows two different
regimes driven by slippage between the layers, and a high sensitivity of the vdW force to the alignment
between the substrate and the membrane.

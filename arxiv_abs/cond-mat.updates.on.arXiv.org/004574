One of the characteristic features of a stochastic process under resetting is that the probability
density converges to a nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS). In addition, the approach to the
stationary state exhibits a dynamical phase transition, which can be interpreted as a traveling
front separating spatial regions for which the probability density has relaxed to the NESS from
those where it has not. One can establish the existence of the phase transition by carrying out an
asymptotic expansion of the exact solution. In this paper we develop an alternative, direct method
for characterizing the approach to the NESS of a stochastic process with resetting that is based
on the calculation of the so-called accumulation time. The latter is the analog of the mean first
passage time of a search process, in which the survival probability density is replaced by an accumulation
fraction density. In the case of one-dimensional Brownian motion with Poissonian resetting, we
derive the asymptotic formula $|x-x_0|\approx \sqrt{4rD}T(x)$ for $|x-x_0|\gg\sqrt{D/r}$,
where $T(x)$ is the accumulation time at $x$, $r$ is the constant resetting rate, $D$ is the diffusivity
and $x_0$ is the reset point. This is identical in form to the traveling front condition for the dynamical
phase transition. We also derive an analogous result for diffusion in higher spatial dimensions
and for non-Poissonian resetting. We then consider the effects of delays such as refractory periods
and finite return times. In both cases we establish that the asymptotic behavior of $T(x)$ is independent
of the delays. Finally, we extend the analysis to a run-and-tumble particle with resetting. We thus
establish the accumulation time of a stochastic process with resetting as a useful quantity for
characterizing the approach to an NESS (if it exists) that is relatively straightforward to calculate.

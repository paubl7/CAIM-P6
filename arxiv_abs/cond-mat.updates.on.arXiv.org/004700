We report a systematic study of the superconducting (SC) and normal-state anisotropy of Fe$_{1+y}$Te$_{0.6}$Se$_{0.4}$
single crystals with controlled amounts of excess Fe ($y$ = 0, 0.07, and 0.14). The SC state anisotropy
$\gamma_{H}$ was obtained by measuring the upper critical fields under high magnetic fields over
50 T for both $H\parallel ab$ and $H\parallel c$. On the other hand, the normal state anisotropy $\gamma_{\rho}$
was obtained by measuring the resistivity with current flowing in the $ab$ plane ($\rho_{ab}$)
and along the $c$ axis ($\rho_c$). To precisely measure $\rho_{ab}$ and $\rho_c$ in the same part
of a specimen avoiding the variation dependent on pieces or parts, we adopt a new method using a micro-fabricated
bridge with an additional neck part along $c$ axis. The $\gamma_{H}$ decreases from a value dependent
on the amount of excess Fe at $T_{\rm{c}}$ to a common value $\sim$ 1 at 2 K. The different $\gamma_{H}$
at $T_{\rm{c}}$ ($\sim$1.5 for $y$ = 0, and 2.5 for $y$ = 0.14) suggests that the anisotropy of effective
mass $m_c^*/m_{ab}^*$ increases from $\sim$ 2.25 ($y$ = 0) to 6.25 ($y$ = 0.14) with the excess Fe.
The almost isotropic $\gamma_{H}$ at low temperatures is due to the strong spin paramagnetic effect
at $H\parallel ab$. By contrast, the $\gamma_{\rho}$ shows a much larger value of $\sim$ 17 ($y$
= 0) to $\sim$ 50 ($y$ = 0.14) at the temperature just above $T_{\rm{c}}$. Combined the results of
$\gamma_{H}$ and $\gamma_{\rho}$ near $T_{\rm{c}}$, we found out that the discrepant anisotropies
between the SC and normal states originates from a large anisotropy of scattering time $\tau_{ab}$/$\tau_c$
$\sim$ 7.8. The $\tau_{ab}$/$\tau_c$ is found to be independent of the excess Fe.

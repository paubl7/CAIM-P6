We combine hydrodynamic and field theoretic methods to develop a general theory of phonons as Goldstone
bosons in crystals, glasses and liquids based on non-affine displacements and the consequent Goldstones
phase relaxation. We relate the conservation, or lack thereof, of specific higher-form currents
with properties of the underlying deformation field -- non-affinity -- which dictates how molecules
move under an applied stress or deformation. In particular, the single-valuedness of the deformation
field is associated with conservation of higher-form charges that count the number of topological
defects. Our formalism predicts, from first principles, the presence of propagating shear waves
above a critical wave-vector in liquids, thus giving the first formal derivation of the phenomenon
in terms of fundamental symmetries. The same picture provides also a theoretical explanation of
the corresponding "positive sound dispersion" phenomenon for longitudinal sound. Importantly,
accordingly to our theory, the main collective relaxation timescale of a liquid or a glass (known
as the $\alpha$ relaxation for the latter) is given by the phase relaxation time, which is not necessarily
related to the Maxwell time. Finally, we build a non-equilibrium effective action using the in-in
formalism defined on the Schwinger-Keldysh contour, that further supports the emerging picture.
In summary, our work suggests that the fundamental difference between solids, fluids and glasses
has to be identified with the associated generalized higher-from global symmetries and their topological
structure, and that the Burgers vector for the displacement fields serves as a suitable topological
order parameter distinguishing the solid (ordered) phase and the amorphous ones (fluids, glasses).

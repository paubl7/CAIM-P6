We theoretically investigate electron-hole recollisions in high-harmonic generation (HHG)
in band-gap solids irradiated by linearly and elliptically polarized drivers. We find that in many
cases the emitted harmonics do not originate in electron-hole pairs created at the minimum band
gap, where the tunneling probability is maximized, but rather in pairs created across an extended
region of the Brillouin zone (BZ). In these situations, the analogy to gas-phase HHG in terms of the
short- and long-trajectory categorizations is inadequate. Our analysis methodology comprises
three complementary levels of theory: the numerical solutions to the semiconductor Bloch equations,
an extended semiclassical recollision model, and a quantum wave packet approach. We apply this
methodology to two general material types with representative band structures: a bulk system and
a hexagonal monolayer system. In the bulk, the interband harmonics generated using elliptically-polarized
drivers are found to originate not from tunneling at the minimum band gap $\Gamma$, but from regions
away from it. In the monolayer system driven by linearly-polarized pulses, tunneling regions near
different symmetry points in the BZ lead to distinct harmonic energies and emission profiles. We
show that the imperfect recollisions, where an electron-hole pair recollide while being spatially
separated, are important in both bulk and monolayer materials. The excellent agreement between
our three levels of theory highlights and characterizes the complexity behind the HHG emission
dynamics in solids, and expands on the notion of interband HHG as always originating in trajectories
tunnelled at the minimum band gap. Our work furthers the fundamental understanding of HHG in periodic
systems and will benefit the future design of experiments.

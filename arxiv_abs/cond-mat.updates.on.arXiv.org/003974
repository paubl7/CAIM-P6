The fabrication of nanomaterials involves self-ordering processes of functional molecules on
inorganic surfaces. To obtain specific molecular arrangements, a common strategy is to equip molecules
with functional groups. However, focusing on the functional groups alone does not provide a comprehensive
picture. Especially at interfaces, processes that govern self-ordering are complex and involve
various physical and chemical effects, often leading to structures that defy chemical intuition,
as we showcase here on the example of a homologous series of quinones on Ag(111). From chemical intuition
one could expect that such quinones, which all bear the same functionalization, form similar motifs.
In salient contrast, our joint theoretical and experimental study shows that profoundly different
structures are formed. Using a machine-learning-based structure search algorithm, we find that
this is due to a shift of the balance of three antagonizing driving forces: adsorbate-substrate
interactions governing adsorption sites, adsorbate-adsorbate interactions favoring close
packing, and steric hindrance inhibiting certain otherwise energetically beneficial molecular
arrangements. The theoretical structures show excellent agreement with our experimental characterizations
of the organic/inorganic interfaces, both for the unit cell sizes and the orientations of the molecules
within. With a detailed examination of all driving forces, we are further able to devise a design
principle for self-assembly of functionalized molecules. The non-intuitive interplay of similarly
strong interaction mechanisms will continue to be a challenging aspect for the design of functional
interfaces. Our agreement between theory and experiment combined with the new physical insights
indicates that these methods have now reached the necessary accuracy to do so.

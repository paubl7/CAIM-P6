Reflectionless potentials play an important role in constructing exact solutions to classical
dynamical systems, non-perturbative solutions of various large-N field theories, and closely
related solitonic solutions to the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations in the theory of superconductivity.
These solutions rely on the inverse scattering method, which reduces these seemingly unrelated
problems to identifying reflectionless potentials of an auxiliary one-dimensional quantum scattering
problem. There are several ways of constructing these potentials, one of which is quantum mechanical
supersymmetry (SUSY). In this paper, motivated by recent experimental platforms, we generalize
this framework to develop a theory of solitons in lattice versions of interacting field theories.
Our analysis hinges on the use of trace identities, which are relations connecting the potential
of an equation of motion to the scattering data. For a discrete Schr\"odinger operator, such trace
identities are well known, and we derive a new set of identities for the discrete Dirac operator.
We then use these in a lattice Gross-Neveu and chiral Gross-Neveu (Nambu-Jona-Lasinio) model to
show that lattice solitons correspond to reflectionless potentials associated with the discrete
scattering problem. These models are of significance as they are equivalent to a mean-field theory
of a lattice superconductor. To explicitly construct these solitons, we generalize supersymmetric
quantum mechanics to tight-binding models. We show that a matrix transformation exists that maps
a tight-binding model to an isospectral one which shares the same structure and scattering properties.
The corresponding soliton solutions have both modulated hopping and onsite potential; we explicitly
compute both topological and non-topological soliton solutions as well as bound state spectra
in the aforementioned models.

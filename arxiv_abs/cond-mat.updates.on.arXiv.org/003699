In some d-electron oxides the measured effective mass m(exptl) has long been known to be significantly
larger than the model effective mass m(model) deduced from mean-field band theory, i.e., m(exptl)
= beta * m(model), where beta > 1 is the "mass enhancement", or "mass renormalization" factor. Previous
applications of density functional theory (DFT), based on the smallest number of possible magnetic,
orbital, and structural degrees of freedom, missed such mass enhancement, a fact that was taken
as evidence of strong electronic correlation being the exclusive enabling physics. The current
paper reports that known modalities of energy-lowering symmetry-broken spin and structural effects
included in mean-field DFT show mass enhancement for both electrons and holes in a range of d-electron
perovskites SrVO3, SrTiO3, BaTiO3, and LaMnO3 as well as p-electron perovskites CsPbI3 and SrBiO3,
including metals (SrVO3) and insulators (the rest). This is revealed only when enlarged unit cells
of the same parent global symmetry, which are large enough to allow for symmetry breaking distortions
and concomitant variations in spin order, are explored for their ability to lower the total energy.
The paper analyzes the contributions of different symmetry-broken modalities to mass enhancement,
finds common effects in the range of d- as well as p-electron perovskites. Thus, symmetry breaking
in mean-field theory could describe effects that were previously attributed exclusively to complex
correlated treatments. Indeed, broken symmetries are often experimentally observed, e.g., octahedral
tilting, Jahn-Teller distortions, or bond disproportionation, and often provide intuitive explanations
in terms of degeneracy removal due to lowering of structural symmetry, or as shifting of band energies
in explainable directions.

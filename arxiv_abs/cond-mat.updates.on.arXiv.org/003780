We study the electronic and structural properties of substitutional impurities of graphenelike
nanoporous materials C$_2$N, $tg$-, and $hg$-C$_3$N$_4$ by means of density functional theory
calculations. We consider four types of impurities; boron substitution on carbon sites (B(C)),
carbon substitution on nitrogen sites (C(N)), nitrogen substitution on carbon sites (N(C)), and
sulfur substitution on nitrogen sites (S(N)). From cohesive energy calculations, we find that
the C(N) and B(C) substitutions are the most energetically favorable and induce small bond modifications
in the vicinity of the impurity, while the S(N) induces strong lattice distortions. Though all of
the studied impurities induce defect levels inside the band gap of these materials, their electronic
properties are poles apart depending on the behavior of the impurity as an acceptor or a donor. It
is also observed that acceptor (donor) wavefunctions are composed only of $\sigma$ ($\pi$) orbitals
from the impurity itself and/or neighboring sites. Consequently, acceptor wavefunctions are
directed towards the pores and donor wavefunctions are more extended throughout the neighboring
atoms, a property that could further be explored to modify the interaction between these materials
and adsorbates. Moreover, impurity properties display a strong site sensitivity and ground state
binding energies ranging from $0.03$ to $1.13$ eV, thus offering an interesting route for tuning
the optical properties of these materials. Finally, spin-polarized calculations reveal that
all impurity configurations have a magnetic ground state that rises from the spin splitting of the
impurity levels. In a few configurations, more than one impurity level can be found inside the gap
and two of them could potentially be explored as two-level systems for single-photon emission,
following similar proposals recently made on defect complexes on TMDCs.

We recently reported [1,2] measurements of the charge density fluctuations in the strange metal
cuprate Bi$_{2.1}$Sr$_{1.9}$Ca$_{1.0}$Cu$_{2.0}$O$_{8+x}$ using both reflection M-EELS
and transmission EELS with $\leq$10 meV energy resolution. We observed the well-known 1 eV plasmon
in this material for momentum $q\lesssim$ 0.12 r.l.u., but found that it does not persist to large
$q$. For $q\gtrsim0.12$ r.l.u., we observe a frequency-independent continuum, similar to that
observed in early Raman scattering experiments [3,4], that correlates highly with the strange
metal phase [2]. In his Comment (arXiv:2103.10268), Joerg Fink claims we do not see the plasmon,
and that our results are inconsistent with optics, RIXS, and the author's own transmission EELS
measurements with $\sim$100 meV resolution from the early 1990's [5,6]. The author claims we have
made a trigonometry error and are measuring a larger momentum than we think. The author asserts that
the two-particle excitations of cuprate strange metals are accurately described by weakly interacting
band theory in RPA with corrections for conduction band carrier lifetimes and Umklapp effects.
Here, we show that the author's Comment is in contradiction with known information from the literature.
At $q\lesssim0.12$ r.l.u. we see the same 1 eV plasmon as other techniques. Moreover we compute our
momentum correctly, adjusting the sample and detector angles during an energy scan to keep $q$ fixed.
The only discrepancy is between our data and the results of Ref. [5] for $q\gtrsim0.12$ r.l.u. where,
because of the coarse resolution used, the data had to be corrected for interference from the elastic
line. A reexamination of these corrections in early transmission EELS measurements would likely
shed light on this discrepancy.

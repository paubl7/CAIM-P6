Tunability of polar and semiconducting properties of low-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs) have propelled them to the forefront of fundamental and applied physical research. These
materials can vary from non-polar to ferroelectric, and from direct-band semiconductor to metallic.
However, in addition to classical controls such as composition, doping, and field effect in TMDs
the additional degrees of freedom emerge due to the curvature-induced electron redistribution
and associated changes in electronic properties. Here we numerically explore the elastic and electric
fields, flexoelectric polarization and free charge density for a TMD nanoflake placed on a rough
substrate with a sinusoidal profile of the corrugation using finite element modelling. Numerical
results for different flake thickness and corrugation depth yield insight into the flexoelectric
nature of the out-of-plane electric polarization and establish the unambiguous correlation between
the polarization and static conductivity modulation caused by inhomogeneous elastic strains
coupled with deformation potential and strain gradients, which evolve in TMD nanoflake due to the
adhesion between the flake surface and corrugated substrate. We revealed a pronounced maximum
at the thickness dependences of the electron and hole conductivity of MoS2 and MoTe2 nanoflakes
placed on a metallic substrate, which opens the way for their geometry optimization towards significant
improvement their polar and electronic properties, necessary for their advanced applications
in nanoelectronics and memory devices.Specifically, obtained results can be useful for elaboration
of nanoscale straintronic devices based on the bended MoS2, MoTe2 and MoSTe nanoflakes, such as
diodes and bipolar transistors with a bending-controllable sharpness of p-n junctions.

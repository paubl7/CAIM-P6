The Ni-based superalloy Alloy 718 is used in aircraft engines as high-pressure turbine discs and
must endure challenging demands on high-temperature yield strength, creep-, and oxidation-resistance.
Nanoscale $\gamma^{\prime}$- and $\gamma^{\prime \prime}$-precipitates commonly found in
duplet and triplet co-precipitate morphologies provide high-temperature strength under these
harsh operating conditions. Direct ageing of Alloy 718 is an attractive alternative manufacturing
route known to increase the yield strength at 650 $^{\deg}$C by at least +10 $\%$, by both retaining
high dislocation densities and changing the nanoscale co-precipitate morphology. However, the
detailed nucleation and growth mechanisms of the duplet and triplet co-precipitate morphologies
of $\gamma^{\prime}$ and $\gamma^{\prime \prime}$ during the direct ageing process remain unknown.
We provide a correlative high-resolution microscopy approach using transmission electron microscopy,
high-angle annular dark-field imaging, and atom probe microscopy to reveal the early stages of
precipitation during direct ageing of Alloy 718. Quantitative stereological analyses of the $\gamma^{\prime}$-
and $\gamma^{\prime \prime}$-precipitate dispersions as well as their chemical compositions
have allowed us to propose a qualitative model of the microstructural evolution. It is shown that
fine $\gamma^{\prime}$- and $\gamma^{\prime \prime}$-precipitates nucleate homogeneously
and grow coherently. However, $\gamma^{\prime \prime}$-precipitates also nucleate heterogeneously
on dislocations and experience accelerated growth due to Nb pipe diffusion. Moreover, the co-precipitation
reactions are largely influenced by solute availability and the potential for enrichment of Nb
and rejection of Al+Ti.

Robustness against disorder and defects is a pivotal advantage of topological systems, manifested
by absence of electronic backscattering in the quantum Hall and spin-Hall effects, and unidirectional
waveguiding in their classical analogs. Two-dimensional (2D) topological insulators, in particular,
provide unprecedented opportunities in a variety of fields due to their compact planar geometries
compatible with the fabrication technologies used in modern electronics and photonics. Among
all 2D topological phases, Chern insulators are to date the most reliable designs due to the genuine
backscattering immunity of their non-reciprocal edge modes, brought via time-reversal symmetry
breaking. Yet, such resistance to fabrication tolerances is limited to fluctuations of the same
order of magnitude as their band gap, limiting their resilience to small perturbations only. Here,
we tackle this vexing problem by introducing the concept of anomalous non-reciprocal topological
networks, that survive disorder levels with strengths arbitrarily larger than their bandgap.
We explore the general conditions to obtain such unusual effect in systems made of unitary three-port
scattering matrices connected by phase links, and establish the superior robustness of the anomalous
edge modes over the Chern ones to phase link disorder of arbitrarily large values. We confirm experimentally
the exceptional resilience of the anomalous phase, and demonstrate its operation by building an
ideal anomalous topological circulator despite its arbitrary shape and large number of ports.
Our results pave the way to efficient, arbitrary planar energy transport on 2D substrates for wave
devices with full protection against large fabrication flaws or imperfections.

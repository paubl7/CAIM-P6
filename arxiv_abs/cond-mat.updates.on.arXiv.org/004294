Graphene-based moir\'{e} systems have attracted considerable interest in recent years as they
display a remarkable variety of correlated phenomena. Besides insulating and superconducting
phases in the vicinity of integer fillings of the moir\'{e} unit cell, there is growing evidence
for electronic nematic order both in twisted bilayer graphene and twisted double-bilayer graphene
(tDBG), as signaled by the spontaneous breaking of the threefold rotational symmetry of the moir\'{e}
superlattices. Here, we combine symmetry-based analysis with a microscopic continuum model to
investigate the structure of the nematic phase of tDBG and its experimental manifestations. First,
we perform a detailed comparison between the theoretically calculated local density of states
and recent scanning tunneling microscopy data [arXiv:2009.11645] to resolve the internal structure
of the nematic order parameter in terms of the layer, sublattice, spin, and valley degrees of freedom.
We find strong evidence that the dominant contribution to the nematic order parameter comes from
states at the moir\'{e} scale rather than at the microscopic scale of the individual graphene layers,
which demonstrates the key role played by the moir\'e degrees of freedom and confirms the correlated
nature of the nematic phase in tDBG. Secondly, our analysis reveals an unprecedented tunability
of the orientation of the nematic director in tDBG by an externally applied electric field, allowing
the director to rotate away from high-symmetry crystalline directions. We compute the expected
fingerprints of this rotation in both STM and transport experiments, providing feasible ways to
probe it. Rooted in the strong sensitivity of the flat bands of tDBG to the displacement field, this
effect opens an interesting route to the electrostatic control of electronic nematicity in moir\'{e}
systems.

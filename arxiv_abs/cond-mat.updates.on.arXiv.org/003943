We review continuum elastic models for the transmission of both external forces and internal active
cellular forces in biopolymer gels, and relate them to recent experiments. Rather than being exhaustive,
we focus on continuum elastic models for small affine deformations and intend to provide a systematic
continuum method and some analytical perspectives to the study of force transmissions in biopolymer
gels. We start from a very brief review of the nonlinear mechanics of individual biopolymers and
a summary of constitutive models for the nonlinear elasticity of biopolymer gels. We next show that
the simple 3-chain model can give predictions that well fit the shear experiments of some biopolymer
gels, including the effects of strain-stiffening and negative normal stress. We then review continuum
models for the transmission of internal active forces that are induced by a spherically contracting
cell embedded in a three-dimensional biopolymer gel. Various scaling regimes for the decay of cell-induced
displacements are identified for linear isotropic and anisotropic materials, and for biopolymer
gels with nonlinear compressive-softening and strain-stiffening elasticity, respectively.
After that, we present (using an energetic approach) the generic and unified continuum theory proposed
in [Ben-Yaakov, Soft Matter, 2015, 11, 1412] about how the transmission of forces in the biogel matrix
can mediate long-range interactions between cells with mechanical homeostasis. We show the predictions
of the theory in a special hexagonal multicellular array, and relate them to recent experiments.
Finally, we conclude this paper with comments on the limitations and outlook of continuum modeling,
and highlight the needs of complementary theoretical approaches such as discrete network simulations
to force transmissions in biopolymer gels and phenomenological active gel theories for multicellular
systems.

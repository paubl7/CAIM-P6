While machine learning (ML) in experimental research has demonstrated impressive predictive
capabilities, inductive reasoning and knowledge extraction remain elusive tasks, in part because
of the difficulty extracting fungible knowledge representations from experimental data. In this
manuscript, we use ML to infer the underlying dynamical differential equation (DE) from experimental
data of degrading organic-inorganic methylammonium lead iodide (MAPI) perovskite thin films
under environmental stressors (elevated temperature, humidity, and light). We apply a sparse
regression algorithm that automatically identifies the differential equation describing the
dynamics from time-series data. We find that the underlying DE governing MAPI degradation across
a broad temperature range of 35 to 85{\deg}C is described minimally with three terms (specifically,
a second-order polynomial), and not a simple single-order reaction (i.e. 0th, 1st, or 2nd-order
reaction). We demonstrate how computer-derived results can aid the researcher to develop profound
mechanistic insights. This DE corresponds to the Verhulst logistic function, which describes
reaction kinetics analogous in functional form to autocatalytic or self-propagating reactions,
suggesting future strategies to suppress MAPI degradation. We examine the robustness of our conclusions
to experimental luck-of-the-draw variance and Gaussian noise using a combination of experiment
and simulation, and describe the experimental limits within which this methodology can be applied.
Our study demonstrates the application of scientific ML in experimental chemical and materials
systems, highlighting the promise and challenges associated with ML-aided scientific discovery.

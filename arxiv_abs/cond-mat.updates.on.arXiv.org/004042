Generation of spin imbalance in nonmagnetic semiconductors is crucial for the functioning of many
spintronic devices. An attractive design of spin injectors into semiconductors is based on a spin
pumping from a precessing ferromagnet, typically excited by a microwave magnetic field leading
to a high power consumption of the device. Here we describe theoretically a spin injector with greatly
reduced energy losses, in which the magnetic dynamics is excited by an elastic wave injected into
a ferromagnet-semiconductor heterostructure. To demonstrate the efficient functioning of such
an injector, we perform micromagnetoelastic simulations of the coupled elastic and magnetic dynamics
in Ni films and Ni/GaAs bilayers. For thick Ni films, it is shown that a monochromatic acoustic wave
generates a spin wave with the same frequency and wavelength, which propagates over distances of
several micrometers at the excitation frequencies close to the frequency of ferromagnetic resonance.
The simulations of Ni/GaAs bilayers with Ni thicknesses comparable to the wavelength of the injected
acoustic wave demonstrate the development of a steady-state magnetization precession at the Ni/GaAs
interface. The amplitude of such a precession has a maximum at Ni thickness amounting to three quarters
of the wavelength of the elastic wave, which is explained by an analytical model. Using simulation
data obtained for the magnetization precession at the Ni/GaAs interface, we evaluate the spin current
pumped into GaAs and calculate the spin accumulation in it by solving the spin diffusion equation.
Then the electrical signals resulting from the spin flow and the inverse spin Hall effect are determined
via the numerical solution of the Laplace's equation. It is shown that amplitudes of these ac signals
are large enough for experimental measurement, which indicates an efficient acoustically driven
spin pumping into GaAs.

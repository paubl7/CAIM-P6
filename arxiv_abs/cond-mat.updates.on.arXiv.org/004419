The recently discovered family of vanadium-based kagome metals with topological band structures
offer a new opportunity to study frustrated, correlated and topological quantum states. These
layered compounds are nonmagnetic and undergo charge density wave (CDW) transitions before developing
superconductivity at low temperatures. Here we report the observation of unconventional superconductivity
and pair density wave (PDW) in the vanadium-based kagome lattice CsV3Sb5 using scanning tunneling
microscope/spectroscopy (STM/STS) and Josephson STS. The differential conductance exhibits
a V-shaped pairing gap about 0.5 meV below a transition temperature Tc about 2.3 K. Superconducting
phase coherence is observed by Josephson effect and Cooper-pair tunneling to a superconducting
tip. We find that CsV3Sb5 is a strong-coupling superconductor (2delta/kBTc about 5) and coexists
with 4a0 unidirectional and 2x2 charge order. Remarkably, we discover a 4a0/3 bidirectional PDW
accompanied by spatial modulations of the coherence peak and gap-depth in the tunneling conductance.
We term the latter as a roton-PDW that can produce a commensurate vortex-antivortex lattice to account
for the observed conductance modulations. Above Tc, we observe long-range ordered 4a0 unidirectional
and 2a0 bidirectional CDW and a large V-shaped pseudogap in the density of state. Electron-phonon
calculations attribute the 2x2 CDW to phonon softening induced structural reconstruction, but
the phonon mediated pairing cannot describe the observed strong-coupling superconductor. Our
findings show that electron correlations in the charge sector can drive the 4a0 unidirectional
CDW, unconventional superconductivity, and roton-PDW with striking analogies to the phenomenology
of cuprate high-Tc superconductors, and provide the groundwork for understanding their microscopic
origins in the vanadium-based kagome superconductors.

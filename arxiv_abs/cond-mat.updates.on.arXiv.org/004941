Understanding the rheology of colloidal suspensions is crucial in the formulation of a wide selection
of industry-relevant products. To characterise the viscoelastic behaviour of these soft materials,
one can analyse the microscopic dynamics of colloidal tracers diffusing through the host fluid
and generating local deformations and stresses. This technique, referred to as microrheology,
links the bulk rheology of fluids to the microscopic dynamics at the particle scale. If tracers are
subjected to external forces, rather than freely diffusing, it is called active microrheology.
Motivated by the impact of microrheology in providing information on local structure in complex
systems such as colloidal glasses, active matter or biological systems, we have extended the dynamic
Monte Carlo (DMC) technique to investigate active microrheology in colloids. The original DMC
framework, able to accurately describe the Brownian dynamics of colloids at equilibrium, is here
reconsidered and expanded to describe the effects of an external force pulling a tracer embedded
in isotropic colloidal suspensions at different densities. To this end, we studied the dynamics
of a spherical tracer dragged by a constant external force through a bath of spherical and rod-like
particles of comparable size. We could extract valuable details on its effective friction coefficient,
being constant at small and large values of the external force, but otherwise displaying a nonlinear
behaviour that indicates the occurrence of a force-thinning regime. Our DMC simulation results
are in excellent quantitative agreement with past Langevin dynamics simulations and theoretical
works for the bath of spherical colloids. The bath of rod-like particles is studied in the isotropic
phase, and displays an example where DMC is more convenient than Brownian or Langevin dynamics,
in this case in dealing with particle rotation.

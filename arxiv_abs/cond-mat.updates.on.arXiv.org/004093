We explore the effect of valley-contrasting gaps in the optical response of two-dimensional anisotropic
tilted Dirac systems. We study the spectrum of intraband and interband transitions through the
joint density of states (JDOS), the optical conductivity tensor, and the Drude spectral weight.
The energy bands present an indirect gap in each valley. Thus a new possibility opens for the position
of the Fermi level (an ``indirect zone''), and for the momentum space for allowed transitions. The
JDOS near each gap displays a set of three van Hove singularities which are in contrast to the case
of gapped graphene (an absorption edge only) or 8-$Pmmn$ borophene (two interband critical points
due to the tilt). For the Fermi level lying in the gap, the JDOS shows the usual linear dependence on
frequency, while when above an indirect zone it looks similar to the borophene case. These spectral
characteristics determine the prominent structure of the optical conductivity. The longitudinal
conductivity illustrates the strong anisotropy of the optical response. Similarly, the Drude
weight is anisotropic and shows regions of nonlinear dependence on the Fermi level. The breaking
of valley symmetry leads to a finite Hall response and associated optical properties. The anomalous
and valley Hall conductivities present graphene-like behavior with characteristic modifications
due to the indirect zones. Almost perfect circular dichroism can be achieved by tuning the exciting
frequency with an appropriate Fermi level position. We also calculate the spectra of optical opacity
and polarization rotation, which can reach magnitudes of tenths of radians in some cases. The spectral
features of the calculated response properties are signatures of the simultaneous presence of
tilt and mass and suggest optical ways to determine the formation of different gaps in such class
of Dirac systems.

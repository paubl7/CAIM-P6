The two dimensional F-model is an ice-rule obeying model, with a low temperature antiferroelectric
state and high temperature critical Coulomb phase. Polarization in the system is associated with
topological defects in the form of system-spanning windings which makes it an ideal system on which
to observe topological sector fluctuations, as have been discussed in the context of spin ice and
Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) systems. Here we develop Lieb and Baxter's historic solutions
of the F-model to exactly calculate relevant properties, several apparently for the first time.
We further calculate properties not amenable to exact solution by an approximate cavity method
and by referring to established scaling results. Of particular relevance to topological sector
fluctuations are the exact results for the applied field polarization and the "energetic susceptibility".
The latter is a both a measure of topological sector fluctuations and, surprisingly, in this case,
a measure of the order parameter correlation exponent. In the high temperature phase, the temperature
tunes the density of topological defects and algebraic correlations, with the energetic susceptibility
undergoing a jump to zero at the antiferroelectric ordering temperature, analogous to the "universal
jump" in BKT systems. We discuss how these results are relevant to experimental systems, including
to spin ice thin films and three-dimensional dipolar spin ice and water ice, where we find that an
analogous "universal jump" has previously been established in numerical studies. This unexpected
result suggests a universal limit on the stability of perturbed Coulomb phases that is independent
of dimension and of the order of the transition. Experimental results on water ice Ih are not inconsistent
with this proposition. We complete the paper by relating our results to experimental studies of
artificial spin ice arrays.

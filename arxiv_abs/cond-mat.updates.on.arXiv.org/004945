As it is the case for all low-dimensional materials, the low energy electronic structure of two-dimensional
(2D) materials are inherently prone to environmental perturbations. While there are applications
(e.g., sensors) that exploit this property, the fact that the band-edge states of 2D materials are
susceptible to often unpredictable environmental coupling effects may pose significant challenges
to their practical applications in electronic or optoelectronic devices. A 2D material couples
with its environment through two mechanisms: local chemical coupling arising from the overlap
and hybridization of wave functions, and nonlocal dielectric screening effects that renormalize
the Coulomb interaction in the system. The local chemical coupling, which may arise from the (often
unintentional) surface adsorption or interfacial chemical coupling, is difficult to predict
or control experimentally. Nonlocal dielectric screening effects, on the other hand, can be tuned
by choosing the substrates or layer thickness in a controllable manner. Here we demonstrate that
the recently synthesized MoSi2N4 is an ideal 2D semiconductor with robust band edge states protected
from capricious environmental chemical coupling effects. We have carried out thorough density
functional theory (DFT) and many-body perturbation theory (MBPT) calculations to illustrate
how the band edge states of MoSi2N4 are essentially shielded from direct chemical coupling to its
environment, and, at the same time, the quasiparticle and optical properties of MoSi2N4 can be modulated
through the nonlocal dielectric screening effects. This unique property, together with the moderate
band gap and the thermodynamic and mechanical stability of this material, may pave the way for a range
of applications in areas including energy, 2D electronics and optoelectronics.

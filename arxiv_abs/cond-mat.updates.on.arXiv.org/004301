Collagen is the most abundant extracellular-matrix protein in mammals and the main structural
and load-bearing element of connective tissues. Collagen networks show remarkable strain-stiffening
properties which tune the mechanical functions of tissues and regulate cell behaviours. Linear
and non-linear mechanical properties of in-vitro disordered collagen networks have been widely
studied using rheology for a range of self-assembly conditions in recent years. However, a one to
one correlation between the onset of macroscopic network failure and local deformations inside
the sample is yet to be established in these systems. Here, using shear rheology and in-situ high-resolution
boundary imaging, we study the yielding dynamics of in-vitro reconstituted networks of uncrosslinked
type-I collagen. We find that in the non-linear regime, the differential shear modulus ($K$) of
the network initially increases with applied strain and then begins to drop as the network starts
to yield beyond a critical strain (yield strain). Measurement of the local velocity profile using
colloidal tracer particles reveals that beyond the peak of $K$, strong strain-localization and
slippage between the network and the rheometer plate sets in that eventually leads to a detachment.
We generalize this observation for a range of collagen concentrations, applied strain ramp rates,
as well as different network architectures obtained by varying the polymerization temperature.
Furthermore, by fitting the stress vs strain data with a continuum affine network model, we map out
a state diagram showing the dependence of yield-stain and -stress on the reduced persistence length
and mesh size of the network. Our findings can have broad implications in tissue engineering, particularly,
in designing highly resilient biological scaffolds.

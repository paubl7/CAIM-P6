We provide here an explicit example of Khinchin's idea that the validity of equilibrium statistical
mechanics in high dimensional systems does not depend on the details of the dynamics. This point
of view is supported by extensive numerical simulation of the one-dimensional Toda chain, an integrable
non-linear Hamiltonian system where all Lyapunov exponents are zero by definition. We study the
relaxation to equilibrium starting from very atypical initial conditions and focusing on energy
equipartion among Fourier modes, as done in the original Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou numerical
experiment. We find evidence that in the general case, i.e., not in the perturbative regime where
Toda and Fourier modes are close to each other, there is a fast reaching of thermal equilibrium in
terms of a single temperature. We also find that equilibrium fluctuations, in particular the behaviour
of specific heat as function of temperature, are in agreement with analytic predictions drawn from
the ordinary Gibbs ensemble, still having no conflict with the established validity of the Generalized
Gibbs Ensemble for the Toda model. Our results suggest thus that even an integrable Hamiltonian
system reaches thermalization on the constant energy hypersurface, provided that the considered
observables do not strongly depend on one or few of the conserved quantities. This suggests that
dynamical chaos is irrelevant for thermalization in the large-$N$ limit, where any macroscopic
observable reads of as a collective variable with respect to the coordinate which diagonalize the
Hamiltonian. The possibility for our results to be relevant for the problem of thermalization in
generic quantum systems, i.e., non-integrable ones, is commented at the end.

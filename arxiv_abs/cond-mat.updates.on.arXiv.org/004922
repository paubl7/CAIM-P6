The dilute-nitride ternary compound GaP$_{1-x}$N$_{x}$ is highly attractive to monolithically
integrate pseudomorphic red light-emitting devices and photovoltaic cells with the standard
Si technology because it is lattice matched to Si with a direct band gap of $\approx1.96$ eV for $x=0.021$.
Here, we report on the chemical beam epitaxy of GaP$_{x}$N$_{1-x}$ alloys on nominally $(001)$-oriented
GaP-on-Si substrates. The incorporation of N into GaP$_{1-x}$N$_{x}$ was systematically investigated
as a function of the growth temperature and the fluxes of the N and P precursors, 1,1-dimethylhydrazine
(DMHy) and tertiarybutylphosphine (TBP), respectively. We found that the N mole fraction exhibits
an Arrhenius behavior characterized by an apparent activation energy of $(0.79\pm 0.05)$ eV. With
respect to the fluxes, we determined that the N mole fraction is linearly proportional to the flux
of DMHy, and inversely proportional to the one of TBP. All results are summarized in an universal
equation that describes the dependence of \textit{x} on the growth temperature and the fluxes of
the group-V precursors. The results are further illustrated in a growth diagram that visualizes
the variation of the chemical composition as the growth temperature and the flux of DMHy are varied.
This diagram also shows how to obtain single-phase and flat GaP$_{1-x}$N$_{x}$ layers, as certain
growth conditions result in chemically phase-separated GaP$_{1-x}$N$_{x}$ layers with rough
surface morphologies. Last, our results demonstrate the feasibility of chemical beam epitaxy
for the synthesis of single-phase and flat GaP$_{x}$N$_{1-x}$ layers with N mole fractions up to
about $x=0.04$, a value well above the one required for the lattice-matched integration of GaP$_{1-x}$N$_{x}$-based
devices on Si.

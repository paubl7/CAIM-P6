The critical Casimir force (CCF) arises from confining fluctuations in a critical fluid and thus
it is a fluctuating quantity itself. While the mean CCF is universal, its (static) variance has previously
been found to depend on the microscopic details of the system which effectively set a large-momentum
cutoff in the underlying field theory, rendering it potentially large. This raises the question
how the properties of the force variance are reflected in experimentally observable quantities,
such as the thickness of a wetting film or the position of a suspended colloidal particle. Here, based
on a rigorous definition of the instantaneous force, we analyze static and dynamic correlations
of the CCF for a conserved fluid in film geometry for various boundary conditions within the Gaussian
approximation. We find that the dynamic correlation function of the CCF is independent of the momentum
cutoff and decays algebraically in time. Within the Gaussian approximation, the associated exponent
depends only on the dynamic universality class but not on the boundary conditions. We furthermore
consider a fluid film, the thickness of which can fluctuate under the influence of the time-dependent
CCF. The latter gives rise to an effective non-Markovian noise in the equation of motion of the film
boundary and induces a distinct contribution to the position variance. At short times, this contribution
grows algebraically in time whereas, at long times, it saturates and contributes to the effective
equilibrium variance of the film thickness. For conditions as they are typically realized in experiments
with colloids, we find that the position fluctuations of the boundary can nevertheless be well described
by a Brownian motion in an effective potential incorporating only the mean Casimir force.

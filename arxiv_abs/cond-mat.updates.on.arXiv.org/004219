In the present study, the structural and hitherto uninvestigated mechanical (elastic stiffness
constants, machinability index, Cauchy pressure, anisotropy indices, brittleness/ductility,
Poissons ratio), electronic, optical, and thermodynamic properties of novel boron-rich compounds
B6X (X = S, Se) have been explored using density functional theory. The estimated structural lattice
parameters were consistent with the prior report. The mechanical and dynamical stability of these
compounds have been established theoretically. The materials are brittle in nature and elastically
anisotropic. The value of fracture toughness, KIC for the B6S and B6Se are ~ 2.07 MPam0.5, evaluating
the resistance to limit the crack propagation inside the materials. Both B6S and B6Se compounds
possess high hardness values in the range 31-35 GPa, and have the potential to be prominent members
of the class of hard compounds. Strong covalent bonding and sharp peak at low energy below the Fermi
level confirmed by partial density of states (PDOS) resulted in the high hardness. The profile of
band structure, as well as DOS, assesses the indirect semiconducting nature of the titled compounds.
The comparatively high value of Debye temperature ({\Theta}D), minimum thermal conductivity
(Kmin), lattice thermal conductivity (kph), low thermal expansion coefficient, and low density
suggest that both boron-rich chalcogenides might be used as thermal management materials. Large
absorption capacities in the mid ultraviolet region (3.2-15 eV) of the studied materials and low
reflectivity (~16 %) are significantly noted. Such favorable features give promise to the compounds
under investigation to be used in UV surface-disinfection devices as well as medical sterilizer
equipment applications. Excellent correlations are found among all the studied physical properties
of these compounds.

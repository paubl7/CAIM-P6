Biomembranes play a central role in various phenomena like locomotion of cells, cell-cell interactions,
packaging of nutrients, and in maintaining organelle morphology and functionality. During these
processes, the membranes undergo significant morphological changes through deformation, scission,
and fusion. Modeling the underlying mechanics of such morphological changes has traditionally
relied on reduced order axisymmetric representations of membrane geometry and deformation. Axisymmetric
representations, while robust and extensively deployed, suffer from their inability to model
symmetry breaking deformations and structural bifurcations. To address this limitation, a 3D
computational mechanics framework for high fidelity modeling of biomembrane deformation is presented.
The proposed framework brings together Kirchhoff-Love thin-shell kinematics, Helfrich-energy
based mechanics, and state-of-the-art numerical techniques for modeling deformation of surface
geometries. Lipid bilayers are represented as spline-based surfaces immersed in a 3D space; this
enables modeling of a wide spectrum of membrane geometries, boundary conditions, and deformations
that are physically admissible in a 3D space. The mathematical basis of the framework and its numerical
machinery are presented, and their utility is demonstrated by modeling 3 classical, yet non-trivial,
membrane problems: formation of tubular shapes and their lateral constriction, Piezo1-induced
membrane footprint generation and gating response, and the budding of membranes by protein coats
during endocytosis. For each problem, the full 3D membrane deformation is captured, potential
symmetry-breaking deformation paths identified, and various case studies of boundary and load
conditions are presented. Using the endocytic vesicle budding as a case study, we also present a
"phase diagram" for its symmetric and broken-symmetry states.

Disordered stealthy many-particle systems in $\mathbb{R}^d$ are exotic states of matter that
suppress single scattering events for a finite range of wavenumbers around the origin in reciprocal
space. We derive analytical formulas for the nearest-neighbor functions of disordered stealthy
systems. First, we analyze asymptotic small-$r$ approximations and bounding expressions of the
nearest-neighbor functions based on the pseudo-hard-sphere ansatz. We then determine how many
of the standard $n$-point correlation functions are needed to determine the nearest neighbor functions,
and find that a finite number suffice. Via theoretical and computational methods, we compare the
large-$r$ behavior of these functions for disordered stealthy systems to those belonging to crystalline
lattices. Such ordered and disordered stealthy systems have bounded hole sizes. However, we find
that the approach to the critical-hole size can be quantitatively different. We argue that the probability
of finding a hole close to the critical-hole size should decrease as a power law with an exponent only
dependent on the space dimension $d$ for ordered systems, but that this probability decays asymptotically
faster for disordered systems. This implies that holes close to the critical-hole size are rarer
in disordered systems. The rarity of observing large holes in disordered systems creates substantial
numerical difficulties in sampling the nearest neighbor distributions near the critical-hole
size. This motivates both the need for new computational methods for efficient sampling and the
development of novel theoretical methods. We also devise a simple analytical formula that accurately
describes these systems in the underconstrained regime for all $r$. These results provide a foundation
for the analytical description of the nearest-neighbor functions of stealthy systems in the disordered,
underconstrained regime.

The different thermo-elastic properties of glass fibers and polymer matrices can generate residual
thermal stresses in injection-molded fiber-reinforced plastic (FRP) objects. During cooling
from mold to room temperature, these stresses can be relaxed by large deformations resulting from
an instability of the unwarped configuration (i.e., buckling). This article investigates the
thermal buckling of thin FRP disks via an analytical formulation based on the Foppl-von Karman theory.
Expanding on our previous work, cylindrical orthotropy with material parameters varying over
the disk thickness is assumed in order to account for thickness dependency of the glass fiber orientation
distribution. A disk parameter generalizing the thermal anisotropy ratio for homogeneous orthotropic
disks is introduced and its relation with the occurrence and periodicity of buckling is discussed.
This is done for a skin-coreskin model, for which the core-to-total thickness ratio is defined.
For fiber orientation distributions typical of injection-molded disks, it is found that there
exists a value of the thickness ratio for which no buckling occurs. It is also demonstrated that the
periodicity of the first buckling mode is described by the generalized thermal anisotropy ratio,
thus extending the results obtained for a homogeneous fiber orientation distribution. Improvements
in the accuracy of the predictions for experimental data available in the literature when using
the skin-core-skin model are shown. Finally, we study the relation between buckling temperature
and disk thickness and propose an expression for the dependence of the normalized buckling temperature
on the thermal anisotropy ratio. Results of FEM simulations are used to validate the proposed expression,
proving its applicability and accuracy.

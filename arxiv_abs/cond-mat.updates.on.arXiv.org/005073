Entanglement transitions in quantum dynamics present a novel class of phase transitions in non-equilibrium
systems. When a many-body quantum system undergoes unitary evolution interspersed with monitored
random measurements, the steady-state can exhibit a phase transition between volume and area-law
entanglement. There is a correspondence between measurement-induced transitions in non-unitary
quantum circuits in $d$ spatial dimensions and classical statistical mechanical models in $d+1$
dimensions. In certain limits these models map to percolation, but there is analytical and numerical
evidence to suggest that away from these limits the universality class should generically be distinct
from percolation. Intriguingly, despite these arguments, numerics on 1D qubit circuits give bulk
exponents which are nonetheless close to those of 2D percolation, with possible differences in
surface behavior. In the first part of this work we study the critical properties of 2D Clifford circuits.
In the bulk, we find many properties suggested by the percolation picture, including matching bulk
exponents, and an inverse power-law for the critical entanglement growth, $S(t,L) \sim L(1 - a/t)$,
which saturates to an area-law. We then utilize a graph-state based algorithm to analyze in 1D and
2D the critical properties of entanglement clusters in the steady state. We show that in a model with
a simple geometric map to percolation, the projective transverse field Ising model, the entanglement
clusters are governed by percolation surface exponents. However, in the Clifford models we find
large deviations in the cluster exponents from those of surface percolation, highlighting the
breakdown of any possible geometric map to percolation. Given the evidence for deviations from
the percolation universality class, our results raise the question of why nonetheless many bulk
properties behave similarly to percolation.

In this work we perform computer simulations of the ice surface in order to elucidate the role of nitrogen
in the crystal growth rates and crystal habits of snow in the atmosphere. In pure water vapor at temperatures
typical of ice crystal formation in cirrus clouds, we find that basal and primary prismatic facets
exhibit a layer of premelted ice, with thickness in the subnanometer range. For partial pressures
of 1 bar, well above the expected values in the troposphere, we find that only small amounts of nitrogen
are adsorbed. The adsorption takes place onto the premelted surface, and hardly any nitrogen dissolves
within the premelting film. The premelting film thickness does not change either. We quantify the
resulting change of the ice/vapor surface tension to be in the hundredth of mN/m and find that the
structure of the pristine ice surface is not changed in a significant manner. We perform a trajectory
analysis of colliding water molecules, and find that the attachment rates from direct ballistic
collision are very close to unity irrespective of the nitrogen pressure. Nitrogen is however at
sufficient density to deflect a fraction of trajectories with smaller distance than the mean free
path. Our results show explicitly that the reported differences in growth rates measured in pure
water vapor and a controlled nitrogen atmosphere are not related to a significant disruption of
the ice surface due to nitrogen adsorption. On the contrary, we show clearly from our trajectory
analysis that nitrogen slows down the crystal growth rates due to collisions between water molecules
with bulk nitrogen gas. This clarifies the long standing controversy of the role of inert gases on
crystal growth rates and demonstrates their influence is solely related to the diffusion limited
flow of water vapor across the gas phase.

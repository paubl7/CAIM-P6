Electronic states in two-dimensional layered materials can exhibit a remarkable variety of correlated
phases including Wigner-crystals, Mott insulators, charge density waves, and superconductivity.
Recent experimental and theoretical research has indicated that ferromagnetic phases can exist
in electronically-doped transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) semiconductors, but a stable
magnetic state at zero magnetic field has eluded detection. Here, we experimentally demonstrate
that mesoscopic ferromagnetic order can be generated and controlled by local optical pumping in
monolayer WSe2 at zero applied magnetic field. In a spatially resolved pump-probe experiment,
we use polarization-resolved reflectivity from excitonic states as a probe of charge-carrier
spin polarization. When the sample is electron-doped at density $n_e = 10^{12} cm^{-2}$, we observe
that a local, circularly-polarized, microwatt-power optical pump breaks the symmetry between
equivalent ferromagnetic spin configurations and creates magnetic order which extends over mesoscopic
regions as large as 8 um x 5 um, bounded by sample edges and folds in the 2D semiconductor. The experimental
signature of magnetic order is circular dichroism (CD) in reflectivity from the excitonic states,
with magnitude exceeding 20% at resonant wavelengths. The helicity of the pump determines the orientation
of the magnetic state, which can be aligned along the two principle out-of-plane axes. In contrast
to previous studies in 2D materials that have required non-local, slowly varying magnetic fields
to manipulate magnetic phases, the demonstrated capability to control long-range magnetism and
corresponding strong CD with local and tunable optical pumps is highly versatile. This discovery
will unlock new TMD-based spin and optical technologies and enable sophisticated control of correlated
electron phases in two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs).

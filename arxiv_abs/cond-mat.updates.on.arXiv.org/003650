We have used molecular dynamics simulations for a comprehensive study of phase separation in a two-dimensional
single component off-lattice model where particles interact through the Lennard-Jones potential.
Via state-of-the-art methods we have analyzed simulation data on structure, growth and aging for
nonequilibrium evolutions in the model. These data were obtained following quenches of well-equilibrated
homogeneous configurations, with density close to the critical value, to various temperatures
inside the miscibility gap, having vapor-"liquid" as well as vapor-"solid" coexistence. For the
vapor-liquid phase separation we observe that $\ell$, the average domain length, grows with time
($t$) as $t^{1/2}$, a behavior that has connection with hydrodynamics. At low enough temperature,
a sharp crossover of this time dependence to a much slower, temperature dependent, growth is identified
within the time scale of our simulations, implying "solid"-like final state of the high density
phase. This crossover is, interestingly, accompanied by strong differences in domain morphology
and other structural aspects between the two situations. For aging, we have presented results for
the order-parameter autocorrelation function. This quantity exhibits data-collapse with respect
to $\ell/\ell_w$, $\ell$ and $\ell_w$ being the average domain lengths at times $t$ and $t_w$ ($\leq
t$), respectively, the latter being the age of a system. Corresponding scaling function follows
a power-law decay: $~\sim (\ell/\ell_w)^{-\lambda}$, for $t\gg t_w$. The decay exponent $\lambda$,
for the vapor-liquid case, is accurately estimated via the application of an advanced finite-size
scaling method. The obtained value is observed to satisfy a bound.

We report a high frequency/high magnetic field electron spin resonance (HF-ESR) spectroscopy
study in the sub-THz frequency domain of the two representatives of the family of magnetic topological
insulators (MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$)(Bi$_{2}$Te$_{3}$)$_{n}$ with $n = 0$ and 1. The HF-ESR measurements
in the magnetically ordered state at a low temperature of $T = 4$ K combined with the calculations
of the resonance modes showed that the spin dynamics in MnBi$_{\text{4}}$Te$_{\text{7}}$ is typical
for an anisotropic easy-axis type ferromagnet (FM) whereas MnBi$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{4}}$
demonstrates excitations of an anisotropic easy-axis type antiferromagnet (AFM). However, by
applying the field stronger than a threshold value $\sim 6$ T we observed in MnBi$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{4}}$
a crossover from the AFM resonance modes to the FM modes which properties are very similar to the ferromagnetic
response of MnBi$_{\text{4}}$Te$_{\text{7}}$. We attribute this remarkably unusual effect
unexpected for a canonical easy-axis AFM, which, additionally, can be accurately reproduced by
numerical calculations of the excitation modes, to the closeness of the strength of the AFM exchange
and magnetic anisotropy energies which appears to be a very specific feature of this compound. Our
experimental data evidences that the spin dynamics of the magnetic building blocks of these compounds,
the Mn-based septuple layers (SLs), is inherently ferromagnetic featuring persisting short-range
FM correlations far above the magnetic ordering temperature as soon as the SLs get decoupled either
by introducing a nonmagnetic quintuple interlayer, as in MnBi$_{\text{4}}$Te$_{\text{7}}$,
or by applying a moderate magnetic field, as in MnBi$_{\text{2}}$Te$_{\text{4}}$, which may have
an effect on the surface topological band structure of these compounds.

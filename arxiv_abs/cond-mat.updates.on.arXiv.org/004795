Low-dimensional descriptions of neural network dynamics are an effective tool for bridging different
scales of organization of brain structure and function. Recent advances in deriving mean-field
descriptions for networks of coupled oscillators have sparked the development of a new generation
of neural mass models. Of notable interest are mean-field descriptions of all-to-all coupled quadratic
integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons, which have already seen numerous extensions and applications.
These extensions include different forms of short-term adaptation (STA) considered to play an
important role in generating and sustaining dynamic regimes of interest in the brain. It is an open
question, however, whether the incorporation of pre-synaptic forms of synaptic plasticity driven
by single neuron activity would still permit the derivation of mean-field equations using the same
method. Here, we discuss this problem using an established model of short-term synaptic plasticity
at the single neuron level, for which we present two different approaches for the derivation of the
mean-field equations. We compare these models with a recently proposed mean-field approximation
that assumes stochastic spike timings. In general, the latter fails to accurately reproduce the
macroscopic activity in networks of deterministic QIF neurons with distributed parameters. We
show that the mean-field models we propose provide a more accurate description of the network dynamics,
although they are mathematically more involved. Using bifurcation analysis, we find that QIF networks
with pre-synaptic short-term plasticity can express regimes of periodic bursting activity as
well as bi-stable regimes. Together, we provide novel insight into the macroscopic effects of short-term
synaptic plasticity in spiking neural networks, as well as two different mean-field descriptions
for future investigations of such networks.

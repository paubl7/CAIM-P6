The Ni-base superalloy 718 is the most widely used material for turbomachinery in the aerospace
industry and land-based turbines. Although the relationship between processing and the resulting
properties is well known, an understanding of the specific deformation mechanisms activated across
its application temperature range is required to create more mechanistically accurate property
models. Direct atomic-scale imaging observations with high angle annular dark-field scanning
transmission electron microscopy, complemented by phase-field modeling informed by generalized
stacking fault surface calculations using density functional theory, were employed to understand
the shear process of ${\gamma}''$ and ${\gamma}'/{\gamma}''$ co-precipitates after 1 \% macroscopic
strain at lower temperature (ambient and $427 {\deg}C$). Experimentally, intrinsic stacking
faults were observed in the ${\gamma}''$, whereas the ${\gamma}'$ was found to exhibit anti-phase
boundaries or superlattice intrinsic stacking faults. Additionally, the atomically flat ${\gamma}'/{\gamma}''$
interfaces in the co-precipitates were found to exhibit offsets after shearing, which can be used
as tracers for the deformation events. Phase-field modeling shows that the developing fault-structure
is dependent on the direction of the Burgers vector of the $a/2 \langle110\rangle$ matrix dislocation
(or dislocation group) due to the lower crystal symmetry of the ${\gamma''}$ phase. The interplay
between ${\gamma}'$ and ${\gamma}''$ phases results in unique deformation pathways of the co-precipitate
and increases the shear resistance. Consistent with the experimental observations, the simulation
results indicate that complex shearing mechanisms are active in the low-temperature deformation
regime and that multiple $a/2 \langle110\rangle$ dislocations of non-parallel Burgers vectors
may be active on the same slip plane.

Approximately $75 \%$ of the raw material and $50 \%$ of the products in the chemical industry are
granular materials. The Discrete Element Method (DEM) provides detailed insights of phenomena
at particle scale and it is therefore often used for modeling granular materials. However, because
DEM tracks the motion and contact of individual particles separately, its computational cost increases
non-linearly $O(n_p\log(n_p))$ -- $O(n_p^2)$ depending on the algorithm) with the number of particles
($n_p$). In this article, we introduce a new open-source parallel DEM software with load balancing:
Lethe-DEM. Lethe-DEM, a module of Lethe, consists of solvers for two-dimensional and three-dimensional
DEM simulations. Load-balancing allows Lethe-DEM to significantly increase the parallel efficiency
by $\approx 25 - 70 \%$ depending on the granular simulation. We explain the fundamental modules
of Lethe-DEM, its software architecture, and the governing equations. Furthermore, we verify
Lethe-DEM with several tests including analytical solutions and comparison with other software.
Comparisons with experiments in a flat-bottomed silo, wedge-shaped silo, and rotating drum validate
Lethe-DEM. We investigate the strong and weak scaling of Lethe-DEM with $1 \leq n_c \leq 192$ and
$32 \leq n_c \leq 320$ processes, respectively, with and without load-balancing. The strong-scaling
analysis is performed on the wedge-shaped silo and rotating drum simulations, while for the weak-scaling
analysis, we use a dam break simulation. The best scalability of Lethe-DEM is obtained in the range
of $5000 \leq n_p/n_c \leq 15000$. Finally, we demonstrate that large scale simulations can be carried
out with Lethe-DEM using the simulation of a three-dimensional cylindrical silo with $n_p=4.3
\times 10^6$ on 320 cores.

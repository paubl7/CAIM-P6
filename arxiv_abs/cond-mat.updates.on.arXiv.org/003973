Advanced characterisation techniques were used on LPBF Ti-6Al-4V samples produced on a heated
base plate. When the substrate temperature is 100{\deg}C the elongation is 6\%, which increases
and peaks at 10\% at 570{\deg}C, then sharply decreases to zero ductility at 770{\deg}C. At 100{\deg}C,
a heavily strained and twinned microstructure, primarily composed of {\alpha}+{\alpha}', was
observed and it was comparable to asbuilt microstructures obtained by conventional LPBF methods.
At higher temperatures, twins are no longer present and instead nano-scale {\beta} precipitates
are observed within {\alpha}' and {\alpha}, as well as dislocation networks (570{\deg}C) and tangles
(770{\deg}C). Solute segregation at crystal defects was observed in all pre-heating conditions.
Al and V segregation at microtwins was observed in the 100{\deg}C sample, reporting for the first
time `selective' and mutually exclusive Al- and V-rich regions forming in adjacent twins. V segregation
at dislocations was observed in the 570{\deg}C and 770{\deg}C samples, consistent with the higher
preheating temperatures. High O contents were measured in all samples but with apparent opposing
effects. At 100{\deg}C and 570{\deg}C was estimated to be below the critical threshold for O embrittlement
and locally aids in maintaining a strength high by solid solution strengthening, whereas at 770{\deg}C
it was above the threshold, therefore failing in a brittle fashion. Based on these observations,
the initial increase in ductility from 100{\deg}C to 570{\deg}C is attributed to a reduction in
microtwins and the dislocation networks acting as `soft barriers' for slip within a coarser microstructure.
The lack of ductility at 770{\deg}C was attributed to local solute redistribution causing dislocation
pinning and an increase of O content in this sample.

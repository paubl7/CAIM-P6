In their comment, Angelini et al. object to the conclusion of [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor., 52:445002,
2019] (1), where we show that in [Phys. Rev. B, 87:134201, 2013] the exponent $\nu$ has been obtained
by applying a mathematical relation in a regime where this relation is not valid. We observe that
the criticism above on the mathematical validity of such relation has not been addressed in the comment.
Our criticism thus remains valid, and disproves the conclusions of the comment. This constitutes
the main point of this reply. We also provide a point-by-point response and discussion of Angelini
et al.'s claims. First, Angelini et al. claim that the prediction $2^{1/\nu}=1$ of [1] is incorrect,
because it results from the relation $\lambda_{\rm max}=2^{1/\nu}$ between the largest eigenvalue
of the linearized renormalization-group (RG) transformation and $\nu$, which cannot be applied
to the ensemble renormalization group (ERG) method, because for the ERG $\lambda_{\rm max} =1 $.
However, the feature $\lambda_{\rm max}=1$ is specific to the ERG transformation and it does not
give any grounds for questioning the validity of the general relation $\lambda_{\rm max}=2^{1/\nu}$
specifically for the ERG transformation. Second, Angelini et al. claim that $\nu$ should be extracted
from an early RG regime (A), as opposed to the asymptotic regime (B) used to estimate $\nu$ in [1] and
that (B) is dominated by finite-size effects. Still, (A) is a small-wavelength, non-critical regime,
which cannot characterize the critical exponent $\nu$ related to the divergence of the correlation
length. Also, the fact that (B) involves finite-size effects is a feature specific to the ERG, and
gives no rationale for extracting $\nu$ from (A). Finally, we refute the remaining claims made by
Angelini et al., and thus stand by our assertion that the ERG method yields a prediction given by $2^{1/\nu}=1$.

We study the evolution of step bunches on vicinal surfaces using a thermodynamically consistent
step-flow model that (i) circumvents the quasistatic approximation that prevails in the literature
by accounting for the dynamics of adatom diffusion on terraces and attachment-detachment at steps
(referred to as the dynamical effect), and (ii) generalizes the expression of the step chemical
potential by incorporating the necessary coupling between the diffusion fields on adjacent terraces
(referred to as the chemical effect). Having previously shown that these effects can explain the
onset of step bunching without recourse to the inverse Ehrlich-Schwoebel (iES) barrier or other
extraneous mechanisms, we are here interested in the evolution of step bunches beyond the linear-stability
regime. In particular, the numerical resolution of the step-flow problem yields a robust power-law
coarsening of the surface profile, with the bunch height growing in time as $H\sim t^{1/2}$ and the
minimal interstep distance as a function of the number of steps in the bunch cell obeying $\ell_{min}\sim
N^{-2/3}$. Although these exponents have previously been reported, this is the first time such
scaling laws are obtained in the absence of an iES barrier or adatom electromigration. In order to
validate our simulations, we take the continuum limit of the discrete step-flow system, leading
to a novel nonlinear evolution equation for the surface height. We investigate the existence of
self-similar solutions of this equation and confirm the 1/2 coarsening exponent obtained numerically
for $H$. We highlight the influence of the combined dynamical-chemical effect and show that it can
be interpreted as an effective iES barrier in the standard BCF theory. Finally, we use a Pad\'e approximant
to derive an analytical expression for the velocity of steadily moving step bunches and compare
it to numerical simulations.

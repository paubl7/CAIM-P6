Ionic gating is a very popular tool to investigate and control the electric charge transport and
electronic ground state in a wide variety of different materials. This is due to its capability to
induce large modulations of the surface charge density by means of the electric-double-layer field-effect
transistor (EDL-FET) architecture, and has been proven to be capable of tuning even the properties
of metallic systems. In this short review, I summarize the main results which have been achieved
so far in controlling the superconducting (SC) properties of thin films of conventional metallic
superconductors by means of the ionic gating technique. I discuss how the gate-induced charge doping,
despite being confined to a thin surface layer by electrostatic screening, results in a long-range
"bulk" modulation of the SC properties by the coherent nature of the SC condensate, as evidenced
by the observation of suppressions in the critical temperature of films much thicker than the electrostatic
screening length, and by the pronounced thickness-dependence of their magnitude. I review how
this behavior can be modelled in terms of proximity effect between the charge-doped surface layer
and the unperturbed bulk with different degrees of approximation, and how first-principles calculations
have been employed to determine the origin of an anomalous increase in the electrostatic screening
length at ultrahigh electric fields, thus fully confirming the validity of the proximity effect
model. Finally, I discuss a general framework - based on the combination of ab-initio Density Functional
Theory and the Migdal-Eliashberg theory of superconductivity - by which the properties of any gated
thin film of a conventional metallic superconductor can be determined purely from first principles.

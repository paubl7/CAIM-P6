In solving optimization problems, objective functions generally need to be minimized or maximized.
However, objective functions cannot always be formulated explicitly in a mathematical form for
complicated problem settings. Although several regression techniques infer the approximate
forms of objective functions, they are at times expensive to evaluate. Optimal points of "black-box"
objective functions are computed in such scenarios, while effectively using a small number of clues.
Recently, an efficient method by use of inference by sparse prior for a black-box objective function
with binary variables has been proposed. In this method, a surrogate model was proposed in the form
of a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO) problem, and was iteratively solved to
obtain the optimal solution of the black-box objective function. In the present study, we employ
the D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer, which can solve QUBO by driving the binary variables by quantum
fluctuations. The D-Wave 2000Q quantum annealer does not necessarily output the ground state at
the end of the protocol due to freezing effect during the process. We investigate effects from the
output of the D-Wave quantum annealer in performing black-box optimization. We demonstrate a benchmark
test by employing the sparse Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model as the black-box objective function,
by introducing a parameter controlling the sparseness of the interaction coefficients. Comparing
the results of the D-Wave quantum annealer to those of the simulated annealing (SA) and semidefinite
programming (SDP), our results by the D-Wave quantum annealer and SA exhibit superiority in black-box
optimization with SDP. On the other hand, we did not find any advantage of the D-Wave quantum annealer
over the simulated annealing. As far as in our case, any effects by quantum fluctuation are not found.

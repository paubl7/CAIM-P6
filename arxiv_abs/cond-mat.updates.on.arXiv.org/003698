Raza et al. recently observed the extraordinarily large energy blueshifts of localized surface
plasmon resonances and additional surface plasmon resonances in silver nanoparticles encapsulated
in silicon nitride, which are not fully understood yet. By using the quantum model consisting of
two subsystems respectively for describing the center of mass and intrinsic motions of conduction
electrons of a metallic nanosphere and a coupling occurred between the center of mass and conduction
electrons outside the metallic nanosphere, we firstly deduced the general energy and line broadening
size-dependence of localized surface plasmon resonances, which removes the divergent defect
of usual 1/R size-dependence. Secondly, we proposed that the additional surface plasmon resonance
in a metallic nanosphere originates from the transition of the first excited state to the ground
state of the center of mass subsystem with energy levels corrected by degenerate state pairs of the
system composed of the center of mass and intrinsic motions of conduction electrons. Then, we implemented
this generation mechanism of additional surface plasmon resonances for silver nanoparticles
encapsulated in silicon nitride and the calculated results are well consistent with experimental
results. Furthermore, we obtained a new energy expression of localized surface plasmon resonances,
with which we successfully explained the extraordinarily large energy blueshifts of localized
surface plasmon resonances in few-nanometer silver nanoparticles encapsulated in silicon nitride.
Finally, we calculated the localized and additional surface plasmon resonance energies of silver
nanoparticles resting on carbon films and the calculated results perfectly explain the experimental
measurements of Scholl et al..

Artificial diamond is created by exposing graphite to pressures on the order of 10\,GPa and temperatures
of about 2000\,K. Here, we provide evidence that the pressure exerted by the tip of an atomic force
microscope onto graphene over the carbon buffer layer of silicon carbide can lead to a temporary
transition of graphite to diamond on the atomic scale. We perform atomic force microscopy with CO
terminated tips and copper oxide (CuOx) tips to image graphene and to induce the structural transition.
For a local transition, DFT predicts that a repulsive barrier of $\approx13$\,nN, followed by a
force reduction by $\approx4$\,nN is overcome when inducing the graphite-diamond transition.
Experimental evidence for this transition is provided by the observation of third harmonics in
the cantilever oscillation for relative flexible CO terminated tips and a kink in the force versus
distance curve for rigid CuOx tips. The experimental observation of the third harmonic with a magnitude
of about 200\,fm fits to a force with an amplitude of $\pm 3$\,nN. The large repulsive overall force
of $\approx 10$\,nN is only compatible with the experiment if one assumes that the repulsive force
acting on the tip when inducing the transition is compensated by an increased van-der-Waals attraction
of the tip due to form fitting of tip and sample by local indentation. The transition changes flat
sp$^2$ bonds to corrugated sp$^3$ bonds, resulting in a different height of the two basis atoms in
the elementary cell of graphene. Both tip types show a strong asysmmetry between the two basis atoms
of the lattice when using large repulsive tip forces that induce the transition. Experimental data
of tunneling current, frequency shift and dissipation are consistent with the proposed transition.
The experiment also shows that atomic force microscopy allows to perform high pressure physics
on the atomic scale.

High-resolution tunneling electron spin transport properties (longitudinal spin current (LSC)
and spin transfer torque (STT) maps) of topologically distinct real-space magnetic skyrmionic
textures are reported by employing a 3D-WKB combined scalar charge and vector spin transport theory
in the framework of spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (SP-STM). For our theoretical
investigation metastable skyrmionic spin structures with various topological charges ($Q=-3,-2,-1,0,1,2$)
in the (Pt$_{0.95}$Ir$_{0.05}$)/Fe/Pd(111) ultrathin magnetic film are considered. Using an
out-of-plane magnetized SP-STM tip it is found that the maps of the LSC vectors acting on the spins
of the magnetic textures and all STT vector components exhibit the same topology as the skyrmionic
objects. In contrast, an in-plane magnetized tip generally does not result in spin transport vector
maps that are topologically equivalent to the underlying spin structure, except for the LSC vectors
acting on the spins of the skyrmionic textures at a specific relation between the spin polarizations
of the sample and the tip. The magnitudes of the spin transport vector quantities exhibit close relations
to charge current SP-STM images irrespectively of the skyrmionic topologies. Moreover, we find
that the STT efficiency (torque/current ratio) acting on the spins of the skyrmions can reach large
values up to $\sim$25 meV/$\mu$A ($\sim$0.97 $h/e$) above the rim of the magnetic objects, but it
considerably varies between large and small values depending on the lateral position of the SP-STM
tip above the topological spin textures. A simple expression for the STT efficiency is introduced
to explain its variation. Our calculated spin transport vectors can be used for the investigation
of spin-polarized tunneling-current-induced spin dynamics of topologically distinct surface
magnetic skyrmionic textures.

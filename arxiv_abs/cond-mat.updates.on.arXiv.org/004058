We study the thermodynamic properties of dimerized spin-gapped quantum magnets with and without
exchange anisotropy (EA) and Dzyaloshinsky and Moriya (DM) anisotropies within the mean-field
approximation (MFA). For this purpose we obtain the thermodynamic potential $\Omega$ of a triplon
gas taking into account the strength of DM interaction up to second order. The minimization of $\Omega$
with respect to self-energies $\Sigma_n$ and $\Sigma_{an}$ yields the equation for $X_{1,2}=\Sigma_n\pm\Sigma_{an}-\mu$,
which define the dispersion of quasiparticles $E_k=\sqrt{\epsilon_k+X_1}\sqrt{\epsilon_k+X_2}$
where $\epsilon_k$ is the bare dispersion of triplons. The minimization of $\Omega$ with respect
to the magnitude $\rho_0$ and the phase $\Theta$ of triplon condensate leads to coupled equations
for $\rho_0$ and $\Theta$. We discuss the restrictions on $\rho_0$ and $\Theta$ imposed by these
equations for systems with and without anisotropy. The requirement of dynamical stability conditions
$(X_1>0, X_2>0)$ in equilibrium, as well as the Hugenholtz-Pines theorem, particularly for isotropic
Bose condensate, impose certain conditions to the physical solutions of these equations. It is
shown that the phase angle of a purely homogenous Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) without any anisotropy
may only take values $\Theta=\pi n $ (n=0,$\pm 1,\pm 2$...) while that of BEC with even a tiny DM interaction
results in $\Theta=\pi/2+2\pi n$. In contrast to the widely used Hartree-Fock-Popov approximation,
which allows arbitrary phase angle, our approach predicts that the phase angle may have only discrete
values, while the phase of the wave function of the whole system remains arbitrary as expected. The
consequences of this phase locking for interference of two Bose condensates and to their possible
Josephson junction is studied.

Key to advancing lithium-ion battery technology, and in particular fast charging capabilities,
is our ability to follow and understand the dynamic processes occurring in operating materials
under realistic conditions, in real time, and on the nano- to meso-scale. Currently, operando imaging
of lithium-ion dynamics requires sophisticated synchrotron X-ray or electron microscopy techniques,
which do not lend themselves to high-throughput material screening. This limits rapid and rational
materials improvements. Here we introduce a simple lab-based, optical interferometric scattering
microscope to resolve nanoscopic lithium-ion dynamics in battery materials and apply it to follow
the repeated cycling of the archetypical cathode material Li$_\textit{x}$CoO$_2$. The method
allows us to visualise directly the insulator-metal, solid solution and lithium ordering phase
transitions in this material. We determine rates of lithium insertion and removal at the single-particle
level and identify different mechanisms that occur on charge vs. discharge. Finally, we capture
the dynamic formation of domain boundaries between different crystal orientations associated
with the monoclinic lattice distortion at around Li$_{0.5}$CoO$_2$. The high throughput nature
of our methodology allows many particles to be sampled across the entire electrode and, moving forward,
will enable exploration of the role of dislocations, morphologies and cycling rate on battery degradation.
The generality of our imaging concept means that it can be applied to study any battery electrode,
and more broadly, systems where the transport of ions is associated with electronic or structural
changes, including nanoionic films, ionic conducting polymers, photocatalytic materials and
memristors.

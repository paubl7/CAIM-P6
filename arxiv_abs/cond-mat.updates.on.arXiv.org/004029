The microscopic mechanism of dynamic phase transition of noble metals is much demanding and challenging
with the development of in situ x-ray diffraction measurements [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 235701 (2020);
Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 045702 (2019); Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 045701 (2019)]. Through rapid compression
like shock impact, gold exhibits unique structural transformation characteristics, in which
the previous theoretical results are far away from the experiments. In order to simulate the complex
process, we construct an interaction potential by training a deep neural network with a set of ab
initio calculations. By using molecular dynamics simulations, the structural transformation
processes for face-centered cubic (FCC) gold under shock compressions have been unambiguously
revealed from the atomic level. In agreement with recent experiments, the sequence of structures,
stacking faults, body-centered cubic (BCC) phase, and coexistence of BCC-amorphous phase are
found until gold reaching completely melting up to 325 GPa, and a much lower transition pressure
(113 GPa) to BCC phase is confirmed. Different from perfect BCC crystalline, the shock compression
generates a BCC structure with many disorders, reducing the free energies and consequently largely
lowering the transition pressure. Interestingly, by introducing defects in the initial FCC gold,
it presents a reverse effect on the FCC-BCC phase transition. These defects in the form of collections
of atoms give rise to the formation of the interface, leading to increasing interface barrier and
reducing internal stress. Therefore, a competitive effect is highlighted between disorders and
defects, determining the FCC-BCC phase transition threshold under dynamical compressions, which
is absent in conventional understanding.

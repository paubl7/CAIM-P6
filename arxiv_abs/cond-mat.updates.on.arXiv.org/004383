Recent studies of FeMnCoCr-based high entropy alloys have demonstrated uncommon deformation
behaviors such as transformation-induced plasticity, which were largely believed to be restricted
to select families of steels. Coupled with the potential for entropy stabilization of high symmetry
phases at high temperatures, this system represents a promising class of materials for structural
applications in extreme environments. Yet, transformation-induced plasticity mechanisms are
notably sensitive to microstructure parameters and the literature offers examples of deleterious
decomposition of high entropy alloys under heat treatment, which raises concerns of resiliency
in mechanical performance. Here, we evaluate the evolution of microstructure and mechanical properties
of a FeMnCoCr high entropy alloy after aggressive heat treatments. Microstructures are found to
retain their characteristic austenite/martensite features, with parent face-centered cubic
grains segmented by hexagonal close-packed laths after heat treatment at 1200 C for up to 48 hours.
Results of mechanical testing reveal an unusual insensitivity of this alloy to grain growth-induced
weakening effects. Namely, the yield strengths of FeMnCoCr samples are observed to remain constant
across all heat treatment conditions, despite a near four-fold increase in the grain size. Close
examination of post-heat treatment microstructures reveals a dramatic decrease in the inter-lath
spacing at longer durations. These microstructure evolution phenomena lead to significant intracrystalline
refinement that counteract conventional Hall-Petch weakening by introducing additional barriers
for dislocation pile-up. These results offer new insights into the mechanical resiliency of this
transformation-induced plasticity high entropy alloy under aggressive heat treatments.

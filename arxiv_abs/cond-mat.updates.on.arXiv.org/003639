In this work, we introduce an approach to study quantum many-body dynamics, inspired by the Feynman-Vernon
influence functional. Focusing on a family of interacting, Floquet spin chains, we consider a Keldysh
path-integral description of the dynamics. The central object in our approach is the influence
matrix (IM), which describes the effect of the system on the dynamics of a local subsystem. For translationally
invariant models, we formulate a self-consistency equation for the influence matrix. For certain
special values of the model parameters, we obtain an exact solution which represents a perfect dephaser
(PD). Physically, a PD corresponds to a many-body system that acts as a perfectly Markovian bath
on itself: at each period, it measures every spin. For the models considered here, we establish that
PD points include dual-unitary circuits investigated in recent works. In the vicinity of PD points,
the system is not perfectly Markovian, but rather acts as a bath with a short memory time. In this case,
we demonstrate that the self-consistency equation can be solved using matrix-product states (MPS)
methods, as the IM temporal entanglement is low. A combination of analytical insights and MPS computations
allows us to characterize the structure of the influence matrix in terms of an effective "statistical-mechanics"
description. We finally illustrate the predictive power of this description by analytically computing
how quickly an embedded impurity spin thermalizes. The influence matrix approach formulated here
provides an intuitive view of the quantum many-body dynamics problem, opening a path to constructing
models of thermalizing dynamics that are solvable or can be efficiently treated by MPS-based methods,
and to further characterizing quantum ergodicity or lack thereof.

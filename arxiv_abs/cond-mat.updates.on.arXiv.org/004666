Recent progress in nanofabrication has led to the emergence of three-dimensional magnetic nanostructures
as a vibrant field of research. This includes the study of three-dimensional arrays of interconnected
magnetic nanowires with tunable artificial spin-ice properties. Prominent examples of such structures
are magnetic buckyball nanoarchitectures, which consist of ferromagnetic nanowires connected
at vertex positions corresponding to those of a C60 molecule. These structures can be regarded as
prototypes for the study of the transition from two- to three-dimensional spin-ice lattices. In
spite of their significance for three-dimensional nanomagnetism, little is known about the micromagnetic
properties of buckyball nanostructures. By means of finite-element micromagnetic simulations,
we investigate the magnetization structures and the hysteretic properties of several sub-micron-sized
magnetic buckyballs. Similar to ordinary artificial spin ice lattices, the array can be magnetized
in a variety of zero-field states with vertices exhibiting different degrees of magnetic frustration.
Remarkably, and unlike planar geometries, magnetically frustrated states can be reversibly created
and dissolved by applying an external magnetic field. This easiness to insert and remove defect-like
magnetic charges, made possible by the angle-selectivity of the field-induced switching of individual
nanowires, demonstrates a potentially significant advantage of three-dimensional nanomagnetism
compared to planar geometries. The control provided by the ability to switch between ice-rule obeying
and magnetically frustrated structures could be an important feature of future applications,
including magnonic devices exploiting differences in the fundamental frequencies of these configurations.

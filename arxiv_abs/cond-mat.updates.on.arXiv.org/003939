Magnetism typically arises from the joint effect of Fermi statistics and repulsive Coulomb interactions,
which favors ground states with non-zero electron spin. As a result, controlling spin magnetism
with electric fields---a longstanding technological goal in spintronics and multiferroics---can
be achieved only indirectly. Here, we experimentally demonstrate direct electric field control
of magnetic states in an orbital Chern insulator, a magnetic system in which non-trivial band topology
favors long range order of orbital angular momentum but the spins are thought to remain disordered.
We use van der Waals heterostructures consisting of a graphene monolayer rotationally faulted
with respect to a Bernal-stacked bilayer to realize narrow and topologically nontrivial valley-projected
moir\'e minibands. At fillings of one and three electrons per moir\'e unit cell within these bands,
we observe quantized anomalous Hall effects with transverse resistance approximately equal to
$h/2e^2$, which is indicative of spontaneous polarization of the system into a single-valley-projected
band with a Chern number equal to two. At a filling of three electrons per moir\'e unit cell, we find
that the sign of the quantum anomalous Hall effect can be reversed via field-effect control of the
chemical potential; moreover, this transition is hysteretic, which we use to demonstrate nonvolatile
electric field induced reversal of the magnetic state. A theoretical analysis indicates that the
effect arises from the topological edge states, which drive a change in sign of the magnetization
and thus a reversal in the favored magnetic state. Voltage control of magnetic states can be used
to electrically pattern nonvolatile magnetic domain structures hosting chiral edge states, with
applications ranging from reconfigurable microwave circuit elements to ultralow power magnetic
memory.

In this document, I present a personal view on the heavy-fermion problem, within a phenomenological
approach guided by experiments. This review presents a set of 'historical' works which established
the ground bases of the thematic during the last decades. An exhaustive and systematic approach
is privileged. After a general presentation in Chapter 2, the properties of heavy-fermion paramagnets,
antiferromagnets, and ferromagnets are considered in Chapters 3, 4, and 5, respectively. Chapters
6 and 7 are dedicated to two specific compounds, URu$_2$Si$_2$ for which a 'hidden-order' phase
constitutes a more-than-thirty-years-old unsolved mystery, and UTe$_2$, where multiple superconducting
phases have been discovered in the last two years. Experiments performed using a panel of techniques
ranging from microscopic (neutron scattering, NMR, etc.) to thermodynamic (specific heat, magnetization,
etc.) and transport (electrical resistivity, etc.) probes, under extreme conditions of low temperatures,
intense magnetic fields and high pressures, are reviewed. They show that magnetism plays a central
role in the quantum critical properties of heavy-fermion systems. An emphasis is given to the intersite
magnetic fluctuations, presented as the driving force for a heavy Fermi liquid, precursor of quantum
magnetic criticality ending in magnetically-ordered phases. They are also suspected to drive
an unconventional mechanism for superconductivity, which develops in the vicinity of quantum
magnetic phase transitions induced under pressure or magnetic field. The appearance of magnetic
fluctuations and ultimately magnetic order in heavy-fermion compounds occurs in a nearly-integer-valence
regime, in which $f$ electrons have a dual itinerant-localized character. Fermi-surface and valence
studies, which give complementary information about this duality, are also considered.

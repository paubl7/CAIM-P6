Nanoparticles of Cr3+-substituted Ni-Zn ferrites with a general formula Ni0.4Zn0.6-xCrxFe2O4
(x = 0.0 - 0.6) have been synthesized via a facile microwave combustion route. The crystalline phase
has been characterized by XRD, TEM, FT-I and XPS revealing the spinel ferrite structure without
extra phases. Crystallite sizes of 23 - 32 nm as estimated by XRD analyses, after corrections for
crystal stains by Williamson-Hall method, are comparable to the average particle sizes observed
by TEM which indicates successfully synthesized nanocrystals. Rietveld refinement analyses
of the XRD patterns have inferred a monotonic decrease behavior of the lattice parameter with Cr
doping in agreement with Vegard's law of solid solution series. Furthermore, cations distribution
with an increased inversion factor indicate the B-site preference of Cr3+ ions. The oxidation states
and cations distribution indicated by XPS results imply the Cr3+ doping on the account of Zn2+ ions
and a partial reduction of Fe3+ to Fe2+ to keep the charge balance in a composition series of (Ni2+)0.4(Zn2+,
Cr3+)0.6(Fe2+, Fe3+)2(O2-)4. The optical properties were explored by optical UV-Vis spectroscopy
indicating allowed direct transitions with band gap energy that decreases from 3.9 eV to 3.7 eV with
Cr doping. Furthermore, the photocatalytic activity for the degradation of methyl orange (MO)
dye was investigated showing largely enhanced photodecomposition up to 30% of MO dye over Ni0.4Cr0.6Fe2O4
for 6 hours. A vibrating sample magnetometry (VSM) measurements at room temperature show further
enhancement in the saturation magnetization of Ni0.4Zn0.6Fe2O4 , the highest in Ni-Zn ferrites,
from about 60 to 70 emu/g with the increase of Cr concentration up to x = 0.1, while the coercivity shows
a general increase in the whole range of Cr doping.

Using Lanczos exact diagonalization, stochastic analytic continuation of quantum Monte Carlo
data, and perturbation theory, we investigate the dynamic spin structure factor $\mathcal{S}(q,\omega)$
of the $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimer chain. We systematically study the evolution
of the spectrum by varying the ratio $g=J_2/J_1$ of the intertrimer and intratrimer coupling strengths
and interpret the observed features using analytical and numerical calculations with the trimer
eigenstates. The doublet ground states of the trimers form effective interacting $S=1/2$ degrees
of freedom described by a Heisenberg chain with coupling $J_{\rm eff}=(4/9)J_2$. Therefore, the
conventional two-spinon continuum of width $\propto J_1$ when $g=1$ evolves into to a similar continuum
of width $\propto J_2$ in the reduced Brillouin zone when $g\to 0$. The high-energy modes (at $\omega
\propto J_1$) for $g \alt 0.5$ can be understood as weakly dispersing propagating internal trimer
excitations (which we term doublons and quartons), and these fractionalize with increasing $g$
to form the conventional spinon continuum when $g \to 1$. The coexistence of two kinds of emergent
spinon branches for intermediate values of $g$ give rise to interesting spectral signatures, especially
at $g \approx 0.7$ where the gap between the low-energy spinon branch and the high energy band of mixed
doublons, quartons, and spinons closes. These features should be observable in inelastic neutron
scattering experiments if a quasi-one-dimensional quantum magnet with the linear trimer structure
and $J_2 < J_1$ can be identified. We suggest that finding such materials would be useful, enabling
detailed studies of coexisting exotic excitations and their interplay within a relatively simple
theoretical framework.

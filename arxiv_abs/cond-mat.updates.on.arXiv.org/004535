Ferromagnetism is most common in transition metal compounds but may also arise in low-density two-dimensional
electron systems, with signatures observed in silicon, III-V semiconductor systems, and graphene
moir\'e heterostructures. Here we show that gate-tuned van Hove singularities in rhombohedral
trilayer graphene drive the spontaneous ferromagnetic polarization of the electron system into
one or more spin- and valley flavors. Using capacitance measurements on graphite-gated van der
Waals heterostructures, we find a cascade of density- and electronic displacement field tuned
phase transitions marked by negative electronic compressibility. The transitions define the
boundaries between phases where quantum oscillations have either four-fold, two-fold, or one-fold
degeneracy, associated with a spin and valley degenerate normal metal, spin-polarized `half-metal',
and spin and valley polarized `quarter metal', respectively. For electron doping, the salient
features are well captured by a phenomenological Stoner model with a valley-anisotropic Hund's
coupling, likely arising from interactions at the lattice scale. For hole filling, we observe a
richer phase diagram featuring a delicate interplay of broken symmetries and transitions in the
Fermi surface topology. Finally, by rotational alignment of a hexagonal boron nitride substrate
to induce a moir\'e superlattice, we find that the superlattice perturbs the preexisting isospin
order only weakly, leaving the basic phase diagram intact while catalyzing the formation of topologically
nontrivial gapped states whenever itinerant half- or quarter metal states occur at half- or quarter
superlattice band filling. Our results show that rhombohedral trilayer graphene is an ideal platform
for well-controlled tests of many-body theory and reveal magnetism in moir\'e materials to be fundamentally
itinerant in nature.

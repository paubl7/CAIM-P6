Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a challenging metabolic disorder characterized by a substantial loss of
$\beta$-cell mass via progressive programmed cell death and alteration of $\beta$-cell function
in the islets of Langerhans, disrupting insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis. The mechanisms
for deficiency in $\beta$-cell mass and function during the hyperglycemia development and T2D
pathogenesis are complex. To study the relative contribution of $\beta$-cell mass to $\beta$-cell
function in T2D, we make use of a comprehensive electrophysiological model from human $\beta$-cell
clusters. We find that defect in $\beta$-cell mass causes a functional decline in single $\beta$-cell,
impairment in intra-islet synchrony, and changes in the form of oscillatory patterns of membrane
potential and intracellular $\textrm{Ca}^{2+}$ concentration, which can lead to changes in insulin
secretion dynamics and in insulin levels. The model demonstrates good correspondence between
suppression of synchronizing electrical activity and pulsatile insulin release, and published
experimental measurements. We then compare the role of gap junction-mediated electrical coupling
with both $\beta$-cell synchronization and metabolic coupling in the behavior of $\textrm{Ca}^{2+}$
concentration dynamics within human islets. Our results indicate that inter-$\beta$-cellular
electrical coupling depicts a more important factor in shaping the physiological regulation of
islet function and in human T2D. We further predict that varying the conductance gating of delayed
rectifier $\textrm{K}^{+}$ channels modifies oscillatory activity patterns of $\beta$-cell
population lacking intercellular coupling, which significantly affect $\textrm{Ca}^{2+}$
concentration and insulin secretion.

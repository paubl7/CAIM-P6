Positrons bind to molecules leading to vibrational excitation and spectacularly enhanced annihilation.
Whilst positron binding energies have been measured via resonant annihilation spectra for $\sim$
80 molecules in the past two decades, an accurate \emph{ab initio} theoretical description has
remained elusive. Of the molecules studied experimentally, calculations exist for only 6, and
for these, standard quantum chemistry approaches have proved severely deficient, agreeing with
experiment to at best 25\% accuracy for polar molecules, and failing to predict binding in non-polar
molecules. The theoretical difficulty lies in the need to accurately account for positron-molecule
correlations including polarisation of the electron cloud, screening of the positron-molecule
Coulomb interaction by molecular electrons, and the unique non-perturbative process of virtual-Ps
formation (where a molecular electron temporarily tunnels to the positron). Their roles in positron-molecule
binding have yet to be elucidated. Here, we develop a diagrammatic many-body description of positron-molecule
interactions that takes account of the correlations, applying it to calculate positron binding
energies for the molecules for which both theory and experimental results exist. Delineating the
effects of the correlations, we find that, in particular, virtual-Ps formation dramatically enhances
binding in organic polar molecules, and can be essential to support binding in non-polar molecules.
Overall, we find the best agreement with experiment to date (in some cases to within $\sim$5-10\%
percent). The approach can be extended to provide predictive calculations of positron scattering
and annihilation $\gamma$ spectra in molecules and condensed matter. Such capability is required
to, e.g., develop antimatter-based technologies including positron traps, beams and ...

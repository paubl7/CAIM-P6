Recent experiments with ultracold quantum gases have successfully realized integer-quantized
topological charge pumping in optical lattices. Motivated by this progress, we study the effects
of static disorder on topological Thouless charge pumping. We focus on the half-filled Rice-Mele
model of free spinless fermions and consider random diagonal disorder. In the instantaneous basis,
we compute the polarization, the entanglement spectrum, and the local Chern marker. As a first main
result, we conclude that the space-integrated local Chern marker is best suited for a quantitative
determination of topological transitions in a disordered system. In the time-dependent simulations,
we use the time-integrated current to obtain the pumped charge in slowly periodically driven systems.
As a second main result, we observe and characterize a disorder-driven breakdown of the quantized
charge pump. There is an excellent agreement between the static and the time-dependent ways of computing
the pumped charge. The topological transition occurs well in the regime where all states are localized
on the given system sizes and is therefore not tied to a delocalization-localization transition
of Hamiltonian eigenstates. For individual disorder realizations, the breakdown of the quantized
pumping occurs for parameters where the spectral bulk gap inherited from the band gap of the clean
system closes, leading to a globally gapless spectrum. As a third main result and with respect to
the analysis of finite-size systems, we show that the disorder average of the bulk gap severely overestimates
the stability of quantized pumping. A much better estimate is the typical value of the distribution
of energy gaps, also called mode of the distribution.

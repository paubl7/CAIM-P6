Impressive progress in the control of atomically thin crystals is now enabling the realization
of gated structures in which two electrodes are separated by atomic scale distances. The electrical
capacitance of these structures is determined by phenomena that are not relevant in capacitors
with larger electrode separation. With the aim to analyze these phenomena, we use linear response
theory to develop a systematic description of capacitance for two coupled electron liquids, accounting
for the wave nature of electrons, as well as for the effect of both intra and interlayer Coulomb interactions.
Our theory leads to a general expression for the electrical capacitance in terms of both intra and
interlayer electronic polarizabilities. The intralayer polarizability is directly related
to the conventional expression for the quantum capacitance, whereas the interlayer polarizability
term accounts for interaction-induced correlations between charges hosted by opposite capacitor
plates. We refer to this latter term as to the cross quantum capacitance. We discuss the implications
of the general expression for the capacitance, show that it leads to established results when the
effect of interlayer correlations is negligible, and that the intra and interlayer polarizabilities
play a comparable role for capacitors with very small electrode separation. Using two different
approaches, we calculate the capacitance in specific cases, and find that the interlayer polarizability
can be either positive or negative, so that the cross quantum capacitance can either increase or
decrease the total capacitance. We conclude by showing that the cross quantum capacitance term
can lead to a non-monotonic evolution of the total capacitance with increasing separation between
the capacitor plates, which would represent an unambiguous manifestation of the cross quantum
capacitance if observed experimentally.

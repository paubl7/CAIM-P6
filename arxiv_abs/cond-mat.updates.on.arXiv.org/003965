We investigate the electronic band structure of graphene on a series of two-dimensional hexagonal
nitride insulators hXN, X = B, Al, and Ga, with DFT calculations. A symmetry-based model Hamiltonian
is employed to extract orbital parameters and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from the low-energy Dirac
bands of the proximitized graphene. While commensurate hBN induces the staggered potential of
about 10 meV into the Dirac band structure, less lattice-matched hAlN and hGaN disrupt the Dirac
point much less, giving the staggered gap below 100 $\mu$eV. Proximitized intrinsic SOC surprisingly
does not increase much above the pristine graphene value of 12 $\mu$eV, it stays in the window of (1-16)
$\mu$eV, depending strongly on stacking. However, Rashba SOC increases sharply with increasing
the atomic number of the boron group, with calculated maximal values of 8, 15, and 65 $\mu$eV for B,
Al, and Ga-based nitrides, respectively. The individual Rashba couplings depend also strongly
on stacking, vanishing in symmetrically-sandwiched structures, and can also be tuned by a transverse
electric field. The extracted spin-orbit parameters were used as input for spin transport simulations
based on Chebyschev expansion of the time-evolution operator, yielding interesting predictions
for the electron spin relaxation. Spin lifetime magnitudes and anisotropies depend strongly on
the specific (hXN)/graphene/hXN system, and can be efficiently tuned by an applied external electric
field as well as the carrier density in the graphene layer. A particularly interesting case for experiments
is graphene/hGaN, in which the giant Rashba coupling is predicted to induce spin lifetimes of 1-10
ns, short enough to dominate over other mechanisms, and lead to the same spin relaxation anisotropy
as observed in conventional semiconductor heterostructures: 50\%, i.e., out-of-plane spins
relax twice as fast as in-plane spins.

Owing to its strong ionic character coupled with a light electron effective mass, $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
is an unusual semiconductor where large electric fields (~1-6 MV/cm) can be applied while still
maintaining a dominant excitonic absorption peak below its ultra-wide bandgap. This provides
a rare opportunity in the solid-state to examine exciton and carrier self-trapping dynamics in
a steady-state non-perturbative electric field. Under sub-bandgap photon excitation, we observe
a field-induced red-shift of the spectral photocurrent peak and threshold-like increase in peak
amplitude at high-field. The spectral response is quantitatively fit with an eXciton-modified
Franz-Keldysh effect model, which includes the electric-field dependent exciton binding energy
due to the Stark effect. A remarkable saturation of the spectral red-shift with reverse bias is observed
exactly at the onset of dielectric breakdown providing a spectral means to detect and quantify the
local electric field and dielectric breakdown behavior in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. The field-dependent
responsivity provides insight to the photocurrent production pathway revealing the photocurrent
contributions of self-trapped excitons (STXs) and self-trapped holes (STHs) in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$.
We employ a quantum mechanical model of tunneling-dissociation of STX and ionization of STH in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
to model the non-linear field-dependence of the photocurrent amplitude. Fitting to the data, we
estimate an effective mass of valence band holes (18.8m$_0$) and an ultrafast self-trapping time
of holes (0.125 fs) from the data indicating that minority-hole transport in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
arises through field-ionization of STH. These results show that a quantitative understanding
of sub-band-gap absorption and p-type transport in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ must include field-dependent
exciton dissociation and self-trapped hole ionization.

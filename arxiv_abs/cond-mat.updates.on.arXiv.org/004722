The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, as well as symmetric anisotropic exchange, are important
ingredients for stabilizing topologically non-trivial magnetic textures, such as, e.g., skyrmions,
merons and hopfions. These types of textures are currently in focus from a fundamental science perspective
and they are also discussed in the context of future spintronics information technology. While
the theoretical understanding of the Heisenberg exchange interactions is well developed, it is
still a challenge to access, from first principles theory, the DM interaction as well as the symmetric
anisotropic exchange, which both require a fully-relativistic treatment of the electronic structure,
in magnetic systems where substantial electron-electron correlations are present. Here, we present
results of a theoretical framework which allows to compute these interactions in any given system
and demonstrate its performance for several selected cases, for both bulk and low-dimensional
systems. We address several representative cases, including the bulk systems CoPt and FePt, the
B20 compounds MnSi and FeGe as well as the low-dimensional transition metal bilayers Co/Pt(111)
and Mn/W(001). The effect of electron-electron correlations is analyzed using dynamical mean-field
theory on the level of the spin-polarized $T$-matrix + fluctuating exchange (SPTF) approximation,
as regards the strength and character of the isotropic (Heisenberg) and anisotropic (DM) interactions
in relation to the underlying electronic structure. Our method can be combined with more advanced
techniques for treating correlations, e.g., quantum Monte Carlo and exact diagonalization methods
for the impurity solver of dynamical mean-field theory. We find that correlation-induced changes
of the DM interaction can be rather significant, with up to five-fold modifications in the most distinctive
case.

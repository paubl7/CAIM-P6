Pursuing fractionalized particles that do not bear properties of conventional measurable objects,
exemplified by bare particles in the vacuum such as electrons and elementary excitations such as
magnons, is a challenge in physics. Here we show that a machine-learning method for quantum many-body
systems that has achieved state-of-the-art accuracy reveals the existence of a quantum spin liquid
(QSL) phase in the region $0.49\lesssim J_2/J_1\lesssim0.54$ convincingly in spin-1/2 frustrated
Heisenberg model with the nearest and next-nearest neighbor exchanges, $J_1$ and $J_2$, respectively,
on the square lattice. This is achieved by combining with the cutting-edge computational schemes
known as the correlation ratio and level spectroscopy methods to mitigate the finite-size effects.
The quantitative one-to-one correspondence between the correlations in the ground state and the
excitation spectra enables the reliable identification and estimation of the QSL and its nature.
The spin excitation spectra containing both singlet and triplet gapless Dirac-like dispersions
signal the emergence of gapless fractionalized spin-1/2 Dirac-type spinons in the distinctive
QSL phase. Unexplored critical behavior with coexisting and dual power-law decays of N\'{e}el
antiferromagnetic and dimer correlations is revealed. The power-law decay exponents of the two
correlations differently vary with $J_2/J_1$ in the QSL phase and thus have different values except
for a single point satisfying the symmetry of the two correlations. The isomorph of excitations
with the cuprate $d$-wave superconductors implies a tight connection between the present QSL and
superconductivity. This achievement demonstrates that the quantum-state representation using
machine learning techniques, which had mostly been limited to benchmarks, is a promising tool for
investigating grand challenges in quantum many-body physics.

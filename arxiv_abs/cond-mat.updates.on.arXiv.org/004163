We present a numerical study on the intraband optical conductivity of hot carriers at quasi-equilibria
in photoexcited graphene based on the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equations (BTE) with
the aim of understanding the effects of intrinsic optical phonon and extrinsic coulomb scattering
caused by charged impurities at the graphene--substrate interface. Instead of using full-BTE
solutions, we employ iterative solutions of the BTE and the comprehensive model for the temporal
evolutions of hot-carrier temperature and hot-optical-phonon occupations to reduce computational
costs. Undoped graphene exhibits large positive photoconductivity owing to the increase in thermally
excited carriers and the reduction in charged impurity scattering. The frequency dependencies
of the photoconductivity in undoped graphene having high concentrations of charged impurities
significantly deviate from those observed in the simple Drude model, which can be attributed to
temporally varying charged impurity scattering during terahertz (THz) probing in the hot-carrier
cooling process. Heavily doped graphene exhibits small negative photoconductivity similar to
that of the Drude model. In this case, charged impurity scattering is substantially suppressed
by the carrier-screening effect, and the temperature dependencies of the Drude weight and optical
phonon scattering governs the negative photoconductivity. In lightly doped graphene, the appearance
of negative and positive photoconductivity depends on the frequency and the crossover from negative
photoconductivity to positive emerges from increasing the charged impurity concentration. This
indicates the change of the dominant scattering mechanism from optical phonons to charged impurities.
Our approach provides a quantitative understanding of non-Drude behaviors and the temporal evolution
of photoconductivity in graphene.

The processing of thin-structured materials in a fluidic environment, from nearly inextensible
but flexible graphene sheets to highly extensible polymer films, arises in many applications.
So far, little is known about the dynamics of such thin sheets freely suspended in fluid. In this work,
we study the dynamics of freely suspended soft sheets in uniaxial extensional flow. Elastic sheets
are modeled with a continuum model that accounts for in-plane deformation and out-of-plane bending,
and the fluid motion is computed using the method of regularized Stokeslets. We explore two types
of sheets: "stiff" sheets that strongly resist bending deformations and always stay flat, and "flexible"
sheets with both in-plane and out-of plane deformability that can wrinkle. For stiff sheets, we
observe a coil-stretch-like transition, similar to what has been observed for long-chain linear
polymers under extension as well as elastic sheets under planar extension: in a certain range of
capillary number (flow strength relative to in-plane deformability), the sheets exhibit either
a compact or a highly stretched conformation, depending on deformation history. For flexible sheets,
sheets with sufficiently small bending stiffness wrinkle to form various conformations. Here,
the compact-stretched bistability still occurs, but is strongly modified by the wrinkling instability:
a highly-stretched planar state can become unstable and wrinkle, after which it may dramatically
shrink in length due to hydrodynamic screening associated with wrinkling. Therefore, wrinkling
renders a shift in the bistability regime. In addition, we can predict and understand the nonlinear
long-term dynamics for some parameter regimes with linear stability analysis of the flat steady
states.

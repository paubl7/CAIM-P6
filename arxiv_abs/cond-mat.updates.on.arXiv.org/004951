Topological phononic crystals have attracted intensive attention due to their peculiar topologically
protected interface or edge states. Their operating frequency, however, is generally fixed once
designed and fabricated. Here, we propose to overcome this limitation by utilizing soft topological
phononic crystals. In particular, we design a simple one-dimensional periodic system of soft cylindrical
waveguides to realize mechanically tunable topological interface states for longitudinal waves.
To this end, we employ the nonlinear elasticity theory and its linearized incremental version to
fully account for both geometric and material nonlinearities of the system. We derive the dispersion
relation for small-amplitude longitudinal motions superimposed on the finitely deformed state.
In addition, our analytical results provide information about the corresponding Bloch wave modes,
displacement field distributions, and signal transmission coefficients for finite cylindrical
waveguides with identical or various unit-cell topologies. Our numerical results illustrate
the low-frequency topological interface state occurring at the interface between two topologically
distinct soft phononic cylinders. Moreover, we show that the corresponding frequency in the overlapped
band gap can be continuously adjusted by an external force. This analytical result is also validated
by the finite element simulations. Finally, we provide the topological phase diagrams to demonstrate
the tunable position and existence condition of the topological interface states when tuning the
external loading. The low-frequency tunable topological interface states with remarkable field
enhancement may find a wide range of potential applications such as tunable energy harvesters,
low-pass filters and high-sensitivity detectors for biomedical applications.

Oxygen vacancies in two-dimensional metal-oxide structures garner much attention due to unique
conductive, magnetic and even superconductive functionalities they induce. Ferroelectric domain
walls have been a prominent recent example because they serve as a hub for topological defects that
enable unusual symmetries and are relevant for low-energy switching technologies. However, owing
to the light weight of oxygen atoms and localized effects of their vacancies, the atomic-scale electrical
and mechanical influence of oxygen vacancies has remained elusive. Here, stable individual oxygen
vacancies were found and engineered in situ at domain walls of seminal titanate perovskite ferroics.
The atomic-scale strain, electric-field, charge and dipole-moment distribution around these
vacancies were characterized by combining advanced transmission electron microscopy and first-principle
methodologies. 3-5 % tensile strain was observed at the immediate surrounding unit cells of the
vacancies. The dipole-moment distribution around the vacancy was found to be an alternating head-to-head
$-$ tail-to-tail $-$ head-to-head structure, giving rise to a quasi-linear quadrupole topology.
Reduction of the nearby Ti ion as well as enhanced charging and electric-field concentration near
the vacancy confirmed the quadrupole structure and illustrated its local effects on the electrical
and structural properties. Significant intra-band states were found in the unit cell of the vacancies,
proposing a meaningful domain-wall conductivity. Oxygen-vacancy engineering and controllable
quadrupoles that enable pre-determining both atomic-scale and global functional properties
offer a promising platform of electro-mechanical topological solitons and device miniaturization
in metal oxides.

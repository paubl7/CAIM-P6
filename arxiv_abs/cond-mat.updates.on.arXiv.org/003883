We study correlations, transport and chaos in a Heisenberg magnet as a classical model many-body
system. By varying temperature and dimensionality, we can tune between settings with and without
symmetry breaking and accompanying collective modes or quasiparticles. We analyse both conventional
and out-of-time-ordered spin correlators (`decorrelators') to track the spreading of a spatiotemporally
localised perturbation -- the wingbeat of the butterfly -- as well as transport coefficients and
Lyapunov exponents. We identify a number of qualitatively different regimes. Trivially, at $T=0$,
there is no dynamics at all. In the limit of low temperature, $T=0^+$, integrability emerges, with
infinitely long-lived magnons; here the wavepacket created by the perturbation propagates ballistically,
yielding a lightcone at the spin wave velocity which thus subsumes the butterfly velocity; inside
the lightcone, a pattern characteristic of the free spin wave spectrum is visible at short times.
On top of this, residual interactionslead to spin wave lifetimes which, while divergent in this
limit, remain finite at any nonzero $T$. At the longest times, this leads to a `standard' chaotic
regime; for this regime, we show that the Lyapunov exponent is simply proportional to the inverse
spin-wave lifetime. Visibly strikingly, between this and the `short-time' integrable regimes,
a scarred regime emerges: here, the decorrelator is spatiotemporally highly non-uniform, being
dominated by rare and random scattering events seeding secondary lightcones. As the spin correlation
length decreases with increasing $T$, the distinction between these regimes disappears and at
high temperature the previously studied chaotic paramagnetic regime emerges. For this, we elucidate
how, somewhat counterintuitively, the ballistic butterfly velocity arises from a diffusive spin
dynamics.

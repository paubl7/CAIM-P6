The operators of localized spins within a magnetic material commute at different sites of its lattice
and anticommute on the same site, so they are neither fermionic nor bosonic operators. Thus, to construct
diagrammatic many-body perturbation theory, the spin operators are usually mapped to the bosonic
ones with Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation being the most widely used in magnonics and spintronics
literature. However, to make calculations tractable, the square root of operators in the HP transformation
is expanded into a Taylor series truncated to some low order. This poses a question on the range of
validity of truncated HP transformation when describing nonequilibrium dynamics of localized
spins interacting with each other or with conduction electron spins. Here we apply exact diagonalization
techniques to Hamiltonian of fermions (i.e., electrons) interacting with HP bosons vs. Hamiltonian
of fermions interacting with the original localized spin operators in order to compare their many-body
states and one-particle equilibrium or nonequilibrium Green functions. The Hamiltonian of fermions
interacting with HP bosons gives incorrect ground state and electronic spectral function, unless
large number of terms are retained in truncated HP transformation. Furthermore, tracking nonequilibrium
dynamics of localized spins over longer time intervals requires progressively larger number of
terms in truncated HP transformation. Finally, we show that recently proposed [M. Vogl et al., Phys.
Rev. Research 2, 043243 (2020); J. K\"{o}nig et al., SciPost Phys. 10, 007 (2021)] resummed HP transformation
resolves the trouble with truncated HP transformation, while allowing us to derive an exact (manifestly
Hermitian) Hamiltonian consisting of finite and fixed number of boson-boson and electron-boson
interacting terms.

In contrast to strongly frustrated classical systems, their quantum counterparts typically have
a non-degenerate ground state. A counterexample is the celebrated Heisenberg sawtooth spin chain
with ferromagnetic zigzag bonds $J_1$ and competing antiferromagnetic basal bonds $J_2$. At a
quantum phase transition point $|J_2/J_1|=1/2$, this model exhibits a flat one-magnon excitation
band leading to a massively degenerate ground-state manifold which results in a large residual
entropy. Thus, for the spin-half model, the residual entropy amounts to exactly one half of its maximum
value $\lim_{T\to\infty} S(T)/N = \ln2$. In the present paper we study in detail the role of the spin
quantum number $s$ and the magnetic field $H$ in the parameter region around the transition (flat-band)
point. For that we use full exact diagonalization up to $N=20$ lattice sites and the finite-temperature
Lanczos method up to $N=36$ sites to calculate the density of states as well as the temperature dependence
of the specific heat, the entropy and the susceptibility. The study of chain lengths up to $N=36$
allows a careful finite-size analysis. At the flat-band point we find extremely small finite-size
effects for spin $s=1/2$, i.e., the numerical data virtually correspond to the thermodynamic limit.
In all other cases the finite-size effects are still small and become visible at very low temperatures.
In a sizeable parameter region around the flat-band point the former massively degenerate ground-state
manifold acts as a large manifold of low-lying excitations leading to extraordinary thermodynamic
properties at the transition point as well as in its vicinity such as an additional low-temperature
maximum in the specific heat. Moreover, there is a very strong influence of the magnetic field on
the low-temperature thermodynamics including an enhanced magnetocaloric effect.

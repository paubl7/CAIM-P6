We show that the general low-energy Bogoliubov-de Genness Hamiltonian in a multiband superconductor
with broken time reversal and preserved inversion symmetry is a generator of real four-dimensional
representation of $SO(4)$. In the particular representation such an effective Hamiltonian is
a purely imaginary matrix, and it is proportional to the antisymmetric tensor of a fictitious electromagnetic
field which one can define in the momentum space. The quantum time evolution of the low-energy quasiparticle
state becomes this way closely related to the classical relativistic motion of a charged particle
in the presence of the Lorentz force that would be derived from such an electromagnetic field configuration.
The condition for the emergence of a Bogoliubov-Fermi surface can then be understood as orthogonality
of the fictitious electric and magnetic fields, which would allow zero Lorentz force. The corresponding
zero-energy eigenstates are identified as the physical timelike and the unphysical spacelike
solutions of the Lorentz force equation. We study the looming instability of the inversion-symmetric
Bogoliubov-Fermi surface in presence of electron-electron interaction by formulating a concrete
interacting model on the Lieb lattice that features the requisite $SO(4)$ kinetic energy term together
with nearest-neighbor two-body repulsion. The latter is shown to favor dynamical breaking of the
inversion symmetry. The inversion symmetry in our lattice model indeed becomes spontaneously
broken at zero temperature at infinitesimal repulsion, with the original Bogoliubov-Fermi surface
deformed and reduced in size. General features of this symmetry breaking phenomenon are discussed
and a comparison with other works in literature is presented.

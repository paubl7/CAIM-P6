Graphite, with many industrial applications, is one of the widely sought-after allotropes of carbon.
The sp2 hybridized and thermodynamically stable form of carbon forms a layered structure with strong
in-plane carbon bonds and weak inter-layer van der Waals bonding. Graphite is also a high-temperature
ceramic, and shaping them into complex geometries is challenging, given its limited sintering
behavior even at high temperatures. Although the geometric design of the graphite structure in
many of the applications could dictate its precision performance, conventional synthesis methods
for formulating complex geometric graphite shapes are limited due to the intrinsic brittleness
and difficulties of high-temperature processing. Here, we report the development of colloidal
graphite ink from commercial graphite powders with reproducible rheological behavior that allows
the fabrication of any complex architectures with tunable geometry and directionality via 3D printing
at room temperature. The method is enabled via using small amounts of clay, another layered material,
as an additive, allowing the proper design of the graphene ink and subsequent binding of graphite
platelets during printing. Sheared layers of clay are easily able to flow, adapt, and interface
with graphite layers forming strong binding between the layers and between particles that make
the larger structures. The direct ink printing of complex 3D architectures of graphite without
further heat treatments could lead to easy shape engineering and related applications of graphite
at various length scales, including complex graphite molds or crucibles. The 3D printed complex
graphitic structures exhibit excellent thermal, electrical, and mechanical properties, and
the clay additive does not seem to alter these properties due to the excellent inter-layer dispersion
and mixing within the graphite material.

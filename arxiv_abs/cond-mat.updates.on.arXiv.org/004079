Quantum fluctuations in the effective spin one-half layered structure triangular-lattice quantum
Heisenberg antiferromagnet Ba$_3$CoSb$_2$O$_9$ lift the classical degeneracy of the antiferromagnetic
ground state in magnetic field, producing a series of novel spin structures for magnetic fields
applied within the crystallographic ab plane. Theoretically unresolved, however, are the effects
of interlayer antferromagnetic coupling and transverse magnetic fields on the ground states of
this system. To address these issues, we have used specific heat, neutron diffraction, thermal
conductivity, and magnetic torque measurements to map out the phase diagram as a function of magnetic
field intensity and orientation relative to the crystallographic ab plane. For H parallel to the
ab plane, we have discovered an additional, previously unreported magnetic-field-induced phase
transition at low temperature and an unexpected tetracritical point in the high field phase diagram,
which - coupled with the apparent second-order nature of the phase transitions - eliminates several
theoretically proposed spin structures for the high field phases. Our calorimetric measurements
as a function of magnetic field orientation are in general agreement with theory for field-orientation
angles close to plane parallel but diverge at angles near plane perpendicular; a predicted convergence
of two phase boundaries at finite angle and a corresponding change in the order of the field induced
phase transition is not observed experimentally. Our results emphasize the role of interlayer
coupling in selecting and stabilizing field-induced phases, provide new guidance into the nature
of the magnetic order in each phase, and reveal the need for new physics to account for the nature of
magnetic ordering in this archetypal 2D spin one-half triangular lattice quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet.

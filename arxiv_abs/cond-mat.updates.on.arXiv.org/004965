The discovery of the Meissner effect was a turning point in the history of superconductivity. It
demonstrated that superconductivity is an equilibrium state of matter, thus allowing to use thermodynamics
for its study. This provided a justification for the two-fluid model of Gorter and Casimir, a seminal
thermodynamic theory founded on a postulate of zero entropy of the superconducting (S) component
of conduction electrons. It also demonstrated that, apart from zero resistivity, the S phase is
also characterized by zero magnetic induction, used as a basic postulate in the theory of Londons
underlying the understanding of electromagnetic properties of superconductors. Here the experimental
and theoretical aspects of the Meissner effect are reviewed. The reader will see that, in spite of
almost nine decades age, the London theory still contains questions, the answers to which can lead
to a revision of the standard picture of the Meissner state (MS) and other superconducting states.
An attempt is made to take a fresh look at electrodynamics of the MS and try resolve the issues associated
with this most important state of all superconductors. It is shown that the concept of Cooper pairing
along with the Bohr-Sommerfeld quantization condition allows one to construct a semiclassical
theoretical model consistently addressing properties of the MS and beyond, including non-equilibrium
properties of superconductors caused by the total current. As follows from the model, the three
zeros of superconductivity (zero resistance, induction and entropy) have equal weight and grow
from a single root: quantization of the angular momentum of paired electrons. The model predicts
some yet unknown effects. If confirmed, they can help in studies of microscopic properties of all
superconductors. Preliminary experimental results suggesting the need to revise the standard
picture of the MS are presented.

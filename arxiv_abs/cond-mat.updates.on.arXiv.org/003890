The practical damage of silicon bipolar devices subjected to mixed ionization and displacement
irradiations is usually evaluated by the sum of separated ionization and displacement damages.
However, recent experiments show clear difference between the practical and summed damages, indicating
significant irradiation synergistic effects (ISEs). Understanding the behaviors and mechanisms
of ISEs is essential to predict the practical damages. In this work, we first make a brief review on
the state of the art, critically emphasizing on the difficulty encountered in previous models to
understand the dose rate dependence of the ISEs. We then introduce in detail our models explaining
this basic phenomenon, which can be described as follows. Firstly, we show our experimental works
on PNP and NPN transistors. A variable neutron fluence and $\gamma$-ray dose setup is adopted. Fluence-dependent
`tick'-like and sublinear dose profiles are observed for PNP and NPN transistors, respectively.
Secondly, we describe our theoretical investigations on the positive ISE in NPN transistors. We
propose an atomistic model of transformation and annihilation of $\rm V_2$ displacement defects
in p-type silicon under ionization irradiation, which is totally different from the traditional
picture of Coulomb interaction of oxide trapped charges in silica on charge carriers in irradiated
silicon. The predicted novel dose and fluence dependences are fully verified by the experimental
data. Thirdly, the mechanism of the observed negative ISE in PNP transistors is investigated in
a similar way as in the NPN transistor case. The difference is that in n-type silicon, VO displacement
defects also undergo an ionization-induced transformation and annihilation process. Our results
show that, the evolution of displacement defects due to carrier-enhanced defect diffusion and
reaction is the dominating mechanism of the ISEs.

The facile synthesis and electronic properties of two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic
perovskites (2D HOIPs) make these self-assembled systems an important class of energy materials.
The basic building blocks of these materials include inorganic lattice frameworks that often consist
of lead-halide octahedra and organic molecules possessing ammonium functional groups. Understanding
the coupling between the inorganic and organic layers is key to unraveling how the electronic properties
of 2D HOIPs relate to their structures. In this work, we leverage Raman spectroscopy measurements
and first-principles calculations to characterize the Raman-active modes in four 2D HOIPs: hexylammonium
lead iodide [(HA)$_2$PbI$_4$, HA = C$_6$H$_{13}$NH$_3^+$], hexylammonium lead bromide [(HA)$_2$PbBr$_4$],
butylammonium lead iodide [(BA)$_2$PbI$_4$, BA = C$_4$H$_9$NH$_3^+$], and benzylammonium lead
iodide [(BNA)$_2$PbI$_4$, BNA = C$_6$H$_5$CH$_2$NH$_3^+$]. We focus on the 1400-1600 cm$^{-1}$
range where the Raman intensity of the molecular constituents is the strongest, and assign the major
peaks observed in experiments as ammonium bending vibrations. We employ a combination of density
functional perturbation theory based on the local density approximation and the frozen-phonon
approach based on the vdw-DF-cx functional to find quantitative agreement between experimental
and calculated Raman spectra. Furthermore, by comparing the vibrational spectra of isolated molecular
cations with those near lead-halide clusters, we show how the inorganic lattice framework modulates
the vibrational properties of the organic cations. We conclude that the properties of the Raman-active
ammonium bending modes could effectively probe the local microscopic structure of the inorganic
lattice framework in 2D HOIPs.

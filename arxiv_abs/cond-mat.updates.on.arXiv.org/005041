The temporal evolution of ordered gamma-prime(L12)-precipitates and the compositional trajectories
during phase-separation of the gamma(face-centered-cubic(f.c.c.)) and gamma-prime(L12)-phases
are studied in a Ni-0.10Al-0.085Cr-0.02Re(mole-fraction) superalloy, utilizing atom-probe
tomography, transmission electron microscopy, and the Philippe-Voorhees (PV) coarsening model.
As the gamma-prime(L12)-precipitates grow, the excesses of Ni, Cr and Re, and depletion of Al in
the gamma(f.c.c.)-matrix develop as a result of diffusional fluxes crossing gamma(f.c.c.)/gamma-prime(L12)
heterophase interfaces. The coupling effects on diffusional fluxes was introduced (PV coarsening
model) in terms of the diffusion tensor, D, and the second-derivative tensor of the molar Gibbs free
energies, G", obtained employing Thermo-Calc and DICTRA calculations. The Gibbs interfacial
free energies are (16.9 +- 3.4) mJ/m2 with all terms in D and G", which changes to (46.3 +- 5.1) mJ/m2,
(92.3 +- 7.9) mJ/m2, and (-18.5 +- 2.6) mJ/m2 without including the off-diagonal terms in D, G", and
both D and G", respectively. The experimental APT compositional trajectories are displayed and
compared with the PV model in a partial quaternary phase-diagram, employing a tetrahedron. The
compositional trajectories measured by APT exhibit curvilinear behavior in the nucleation and
growth regimes, which become vectors, moving simultaneously toward the gamma(f.c.c.) and gamma-prime(L12)
conjugate solvus-surfaces, for the quasi-stationary coarsening regime. The compositional trajectories
are compared to the PV model with and without the off-diagonal terms in D and G". The directions including
the off-diagonal terms in D and G" tensors are consistent with the APT experimental data.

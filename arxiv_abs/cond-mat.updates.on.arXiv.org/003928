A versatile methodology to detect Dirac or Weyl fermions in topological semimetals by transport
or thermodynamic measurements remains an open problem. It is often argued that a $\pi$ phase shift
in quantum oscillations directly corresponds to the Berry phase of topological semimetals. However,
the oscillation phase is complicated by multiple contributing factors including the orbital magnetic
moment, rendering such correspondences ambiguous for a substantial fraction of topological semimetals.
Here we propose the temperature dependence of the frequency, ${F}(T)$, rather than the oscillation
phase, as a hallmark signature of topology in quantum oscillations. At temperatures comparable
to the cyclotron energy, $F(T)$ encodes the energy-derivative of the cyclotron mass -- a quantity
that vanishes for conventional Schr\"odinger-type fermions, yet equals the inverse square of
the Fermi velocity for Dirac/Weyl fermions. We experimentally observe this temperature dependent
frequency in the Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$, and quantitatively describe it by a fitting-parameter-free
model of Dirac Fermions. It is absent in the topologically trivial metal Bi$_2$O$_2$Se as expected
while the material shows a $\pi$ shift of the quantum oscillation phase without any topological
origin. We further identify Dirac fermions in LaRhIn$_5$, despite their co-existence with multiple,
topologically trivial Fermi pockets contributing the vast majority of transport carriers. This
approach requires no ab-initio calculation as input, and is able to identify topological Fermi
pockets which are small compared to the Brillouin-zone volume -- both attributes being ideally
suited to identify the topological character of heavy fermion materials.

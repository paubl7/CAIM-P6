Layered intermetallic compounds with kagom\'e lattices provide access to the electronic structures
and exotic phenomena associated with flat bands and Dirac-type dispersion that are enforced by
atomic connectivity. Here, we report the preparation of ~ 20 mm x 50 mm single crystals of MgCo$_6$Ge$_6$
via laser Bridgman growth. X-ray precession images and electron diffraction measurements show
MgCo$_6$Ge$_6$ crystallizes in space group \textit{P6/mmm}, with a = 5.06094(15) \r{A}, c = 7.7271(2)
\r{A}. The structure, solved at T = 293(2) K, consists of eclipsed Co kagom\'e and hexagonal Ge layers
with Mg and (Ge$_2$) dimers filling the hexagonal channels. Residual electron density maps provide
evidence of Ge-Ge disorder along the c axis. Magnetization measurements indicate Pauli paramagnetic
behavior with a crystalline anisotropy developing below T $\approx$ 20 K. Resistivity data show
a metallic temperature dependence, with evidence of an electron-electron scattering driven contribution
of A = 58(13)*10$^{-5}$ m$\Omega$.cm.K$^{-2}$. Specific heat measurements show a low temperature
electronic contribution of $\gamma$ = 20.84(28) mJ.K$^{-2}$.mol$^{-1}$. The Kadowaki-Woods
ratio is 0.134(21)*10$^{-2}$ $\mu\Omega$.cm.mol$^{2}$.K$^{2}$.mJ$^{-2}$, comparable to
hexagonal layered Na$_{0.7}$CoO$_2$ and strongly enhanced Wilson ratio of $\approx$ 7.7 - 5.2
similar to strongly correlated layered cobalt oxide [BiBa$_{0.66}$K$_{0.36}$O$_2$]CoO$_2$.
Analysis of the phonon density of states extracted from specific heat shows the existence of a low-lying
Einstein-like contribution (T$_{op}$ = 121.41(47) K), a feature absent in the related compounds
YCr$_6$Ge$_6$ and LuFe$_6$Ge$_6$. Our results add to the knowledge of kagom\'e metals and suggest
directions for future exploration to connect structural and electronic behaviors in these fascinating
materials.

Mechanotransduction, the biological response to mechanical stress, is often initiated by the
activation of mechanosensitive (MS) proteins upon mechanically induced deformations of the cell
membrane. A current challenge to fully understand this process is to predict how lipid bilayers
deform upon application of mechanical stress. In this context, it is now well established that anionic
lipids influence the function of many proteins. Here, we test the hypothesize that anionic lipids
could indirectly modulate MS proteins by alteration of the lipid bilayer mechanical properties.
Using all-atom molecular dynamics simulations, we computed the bilayer bending rigidity (K_C),
the area compressibility (K_A), and the surface shear viscosity ({\eta}_m) of phosphocholine
(PC) lipid bilayers containing or not phosphatidylserine (PS) or phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate
(PIP2) at physiological concentrations in the lower leaflet. Tensionless leaflets were first
checked for each asymmetric bilayer model, and a formula for embedding an asymmetric channel in
an asymmetric bilayer is proposed. Results from two different sized bilayers show consistently
that the addition of 20% surface charge in the lower leaflet of PC bilayer by PIP2 has minimal impact
on its mechanical properties, while PS reduced the bilayer bending rigidity by 22%. As a comparison,
supplementing the PIP2-enriched PC membrane with 30% cholesterol, a known rigidifying steroid
lipid, produces a significant increase in all three mechanical constants. Analysis of pairwise
splay moduli suggests that the effect of anionic lipids on bilayer bending rigidity largely depends
on the number of anionic lipid pairs formed during simulations. The potential implication of bilayer
bending rigidity is discussed in the framework of mechanosensitive Piezo channels.

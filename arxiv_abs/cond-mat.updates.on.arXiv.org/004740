Subject of this work is to investigate the kinetics of mass transfer of volatile amphiphiles from
their vapors to aqueous drops, and from the saturated aqueous drop solutions to air. The used amphiphiles
are benzyl acetate, linalool, and citronellol. The adequate theoretical processing of the equilibrium
surface tension isotherms is applied to construct the two-dimensional equation of state, which
relates the surface tension to the adsorption at the interface. The measured surface tension relaxations
with time in the regimes of adsorption from vapor and evaporation from drop combined with the equations
of state provide quantitative information on the change of adsorption because of the volatile amphiphile
mass transfer across the surface. The theoretical analysis of the diffusion and barrier mechanisms
in the case of adsorption from vapor to the aqueous drop shows that the mixed barrier-diffusion control
in the vapor and diffusion control in the drop describe experimental data. The obtained values of
the adsorption rate constants are six orders of magnitude larger than those for hexane and cyclohexane
reported in the literature. The regime of evaporation from aqueous amphiphile solution drop follows
the convection-enhanced adsorption mechanism with desorption rate constant in the vapor affected
by the simultaneous water evaporation and amphiphile desorption. The water evaporation suppresses
the evaporation of linalool and accelerates desorption of benzyl acetate and citronellol. From
viewpoint of applications, the obtained physicochemical parameters of the studied three fragrances
can help for better understanding of their performance in shampoo systems and perfumes. From theoretical
viewpoint, the result show that by introducing an effective amphiphile desorption rate constant
it is possible to quantify the complex volatile amphiphile desorption accompanied with the water
evaporation.

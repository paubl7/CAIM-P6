Buildup of the structural-magnetic model of herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2) - a perspective
spin liquid - has been performed. Main correlations between the structure and magnetic properties
of herbertsmithite were revealed, and three crystal chemistry criteria for the existence of spin
liquids on the kagome lattice - were determined on their basis. First, the presence of frustrated
kagome lattices with strong dominant antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor J1 couplings competing
only with each other in small triangles. Second, magnetic isolation of these frustrated kagome
lattices. Third, the absence of duality of the third in length J3 magnetic couplings (J3(Jd) couplings
along the hexagon diagonals and J3(J12) next-to-nearest-neighbour couplings in linear chains
along the triangle edges), which are crystallographically indentical. The structural-magnetic
models of 24 antiferromagnetic kagome cuprates similar to herbertsmithite have been calculated
and analyzed. The role of the Jahn-Teller effect in determination of the parameters of magnetic
interactions has been examined. One can single out two main ways of formation of dominant antiferromagnetic
nearest-neighbor couplings on the kagome lattice. For each compound the problem of the emergence
of the magnetic ordering was discussed. It turned out that the existence of duality of J3 couplings
decreasing the magnetic system symmetry had originated in the structure of the kagome lattice itself.
Duality of J3 couplings serves as a reason of the emergence of Dzyaloshinski-Moriya forces, which
result in magnetic ordering. It has been demonstrated that the possibility of elimination of such
a duality in herbertsmithite, which made it a spin liquid, constitutes a rare lucky event in the kagome
system. The kagome lattice is not a "Holy Grail" for the spin liquid from the perspective of crystal
chemistry.

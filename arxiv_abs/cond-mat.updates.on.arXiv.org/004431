The recent inflow of empirical data about the collective behaviour of strongly correlated biological
systems has brought field theory and the renormalization group into the biophysical arena. Experiments
on bird flocks and insect swarms show that social forces act on the particles' velocity through the
generator of its rotations, namely the spin, indicating that mode-coupling field theories are
necessary to reproduce the correct dynamical behaviour. Unfortunately, a theory for three coupled
fields - density, velocity and spin - has a prohibitive degree of intricacy. A simplifying path consists
in getting rid of density fluctuations by studying incompressible systems. This requires imposing
a solenoidal constraint on the primary field, an unsolved problem even for equilibrium mode-coupling
theories. Here, we perform an equilibrium dynamic renormalization group analysis of a mode-coupling
field theory subject to a solenoidal constraint; using the classification of Halperin and Hohenberg,
we can dub this case as a solenoidal Model G. We demonstrate that the constraint produces a new vertex
that mixes static and dynamical coupling constants, and that this vertex is essential to grant the
closure of the renormalization group structure and the consistency of dynamics with statics. Interestingly,
although the solenoidal constraint leads to a modification of the static universality class, we
find that it does not change the dynamical universality class, a result that seems to represent an
exception to the general rule that dynamical universality classes are narrower than static ones.
Our results constitute a solid stepping stone in the admittedly large chasm towards developing
an off-equilibrium mode-coupling theory of biological groups.

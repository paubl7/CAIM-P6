We review recent numerical studies of two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermion theories that exhibit
an unusual mechanism of topological protection against Anderson localization. These describe
surface-state quasiparticles of time-reversal invariant, three-dimensional (3D) topological
superconductors (TSCs), subject to the effects of quenched disorder. Numerics reveal a surprising
connection between 3D TSCs in classes AIII, CI, and DIII, and 2D quantum Hall effects in classes A,
C, and D. Conventional arguments derived from the non-linear $\sigma$-model picture imply that
most TSC surface states should Anderson localize for arbitrarily weak disorder (CI, AIII), or exhibit
weak antilocalizing behavior (DIII). The numerical studies reviewed here instead indicate spectrum-wide
surface quantum criticality, characterized by robust eigenstate multifractality throughout
the surface-state energy spectrum. In other words, there is an "energy stack" of critical wave functions.
For class AIII, multifractal eigenstate and conductance analysis reveals identical statistics
for states throughout the stack, consistent with the class A integer quantum-Hall plateau transition
(QHPT). Class CI TSCs exhibit surface stacks of class C spin QHPT states. Critical stacking of a third
kind, possibly associated to the class D thermal QHPT, is identified for nematic velocity disorder
of a single Majorana cone in class DIII. The Dirac theories studied here can be represented as perturbed
2D Wess-Zumino-Novikov-Witten sigma models; the numerical results link these to Pruisken models
with the topological angle $\vartheta = \pi$. Beyond applications to TSCs, all three stacked Dirac
theories (CI, AIII, DIII) naturally arise in the effective description of dirty $d$-wave quasiparticles,
relevant to the high-$T_c$ cuprates.

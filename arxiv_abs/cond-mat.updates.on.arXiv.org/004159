Exploration of new superconductors still relies on the experience and intuition of experts and
is largely a process of experimental trial and error. In one study, only 3% of the candidate materials
showed superconductivity. Here, we report the first deep learning model for finding new superconductors.
We introduced the method named "reading periodic table" which represented the periodic table in
a way that allows deep learning to learn to read the periodic table and to learn the law of elements
for the purpose of discovering novel superconductors that are outside the training data. It is recognized
that it is difficult for deep learning to predict something outside the training data. Although
we used only the chemical composition of materials as information, we obtained an $R^{2}$ value
of 0.92 for predicting $T_\text{c}$ for materials in a database of superconductors. We also introduced
the method named "garbage-in" to create synthetic data of non-superconductors that do not exist.
Non-superconductors are not reported, but the data must be required for deep learning to distinguish
between superconductors and non-superconductors. We obtained three remarkable results. The
deep learning can predict superconductivity for a material with a precision of 62%, which shows
the usefulness of the model; it found the recently discovered superconductor CaBi2 and another
one Hf0.5Nb0.2V2Zr0.3, neither of which is in the superconductor database; and it found Fe-based
high-temperature superconductors (discovered in 2008) from the training data before 2008. These
results open the way for the discovery of new high-temperature superconductor families. The candidate
materials list, data, and method are openly available from the link https://github.com/tomo835g/Deep-Learning-to-find-Superconductors.

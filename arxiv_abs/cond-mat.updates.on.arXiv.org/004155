Spontaneous synchronization is a general phenomenon in which a large population of coupled oscillators
of diverse natural frequencies self-organize to operate in unison. The phenomenon occurs in physical
and biological systems over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, e.g., in electrochemical
and electronic oscillators, Josephson junctions, laser arrays, animal flocking, pedestrians
on footbridges, audience clapping, etc. Besides the obvious necessity of the synchronous firings
of cardiac cells to keep the heart beating, synchrony is desired in many man-made systems such as
parallel computing, electrical power-grids. On the contrary, synchrony could also be hazardous,
e.g., in neurons, leading to impaired brain function in Parkinson's disease and epilepsy. Due to
this wide range of applications, collective synchrony in networks of oscillators has attracted
the attention of physicists, applied mathematicians and researchers from many other fields. An
essential aspect of synchronizing systems is that long-range order naturally appear in these systems,
which questions the fact whether long-range interactions may be particular suitable to synchronization.
In this context, it is interesting to remind that long-range interacting system required several
adaptations from statistical mechanics \`a la Gibbs Boltzmann, in order to deal with the peculiarities
of these systems: negative specific heat, breaking of ergodicity or lack of extensivity. As for
synchrony, it is still lacking a theoretical framework to use the tools from statistical mechanics.
The present issue presents a collection of exciting recent theoretical developments in the field
of synchronization and long-range interactions, in order to highlight the mutual progresses of
these twin areas.

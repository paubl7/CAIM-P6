The observed filling factors in the fractional quantum Hall effect are often successfully described
by established theories, such as composite fermion theory and conformal field theory. There are,
however, several intriguing cases where prominent theoretical approaches posit distinct states,
which leaves verification in experiment ambiguous. One such example is the ground state at $\nu=2/5$
filling in a one-component system, where a composite fermion approach yields a Jain state, whereas
a compelling conformal field theory argument constructs the Gaffnian. Despite the fact that these
states show excellent numerical agreement with the Coulomb interaction in the lowest Landau level,
and with each other through their overlap and topological indices, the elementary excitations
supported by these ground states exhibit different statistics: Abelian for the Jain state and non-Abelian
for the Gaffnian. In a recent paper [Yang et al., PRB 100, 245303 (2019)] it is argued that this is due
to implicit assumptions of short-range interactions in the composite fermion approach for cases
where Landau level mixing is significant. We complement this work by numerically investigating
the ground-state statistics for the $\nu=2/5$ and $3/7$ states in the Hofstadter model with Landau
level mixing taken into account. For this, we perform many-body simulations using the infinite
density matrix renormalization group to compute the area law of entanglement for varying interaction
range. From a detailed analysis of the topological entanglement entropies, we confirm the effective
Abelian statistics for these states in the case of short-range interactions, and we discuss the
potential onset of non-Abelian topological order. We demonstrate that, in the Landau level mixing
regime, the states at $\nu=2/5$ and $3/7$ filling show an increase in topological entanglement
entropy as the interaction range is increased.

We present analytical results for the structural evolution of random networks undergoing contraction
processes via generic node deletion scenarios, namely, random deletion, preferential deletion
and propagating deletion. Focusing on configuration model networks, which exhibit a given degree
distribution $P_0(k)$ and no correlations, we show using a rigorous argument that upon contraction
the degree distributions of these networks converge towards a Poisson distribution. To this end,
we use the relative entropy $S_t=S[P_t(k) || \pi(k|\langle K \rangle_t)]$ of the degree distribution
$P_t(k)$ of the contracting network at time $t$ with respect to the corresponding Poisson distribution
$\pi(k|\langle K \rangle_t)$ with the same mean degree $\langle K \rangle_t$ as a distance measure
between $P_t(k)$ and Poisson. The relative entropy is suitable as a distance measure since it satisfies
$S_t \ge 0$ for any degree distribution $P_t(k)$, while equality is obtained only for $P_t(k) = \pi(k|\langle
K \rangle_t)$. We derive an equation for the time derivative $dS_t/dt$ during network contraction
and show that the relative entropy decreases monotonically to zero during the contraction process.
We thus conclude that the degree distributions of contracting configuration model networks converge
towards a Poisson distribution. Since the contracting networks remain uncorrelated, this means
that their structures converge towards an Erd{\H o}s-R\'enyi (ER) graph structure, substantiating
earlier results obtained using direct integration of the master equation and computer simulations
[I. Tishby, O. Biham and E. Katzav, {\it Phys. Rev. E} {\bf 100}, 032314 (2019)]. We demonstrate the
convergence for configuration model networks with degenerate degree distributions (random regular
graphs), exponential degree distributions and power-law degree distributions (scale-free networks).

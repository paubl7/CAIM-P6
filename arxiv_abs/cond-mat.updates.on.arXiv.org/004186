A hierarchical (triple scale) simulation methodology is presented for the prediction of the dynamical
and rheological properties of high molecular weight entangled polymer melts. The methodology
consists of atomistic, moderately coarse-grained (mCG), and highly coarse-grained slip-spring
(SLSP) simulations. At the mCG level, a few chemically bonded atoms are lumped into one coarse-grained
bead. At this level, the chemical identity of the atomistic system, and the interchain topological
constraints (entanglements) are preserved. The mCG potentials are derived by matching local structural
distributions of the mCG model to those of the atomistic model through iterative Boltzmann inversion.
For matching mCG and atomistic dynamics, the mCG time is scaled by a time scaling factor, which compensates
for the lower monomeric friction coefficient of the mCG model than that of the atomistic one. At the
SLSP level, multiple Kuhn segments of a polymer chain are represented by one coarse-grained bead.
The very soft nonbonded interactions between beads do not prevent chain crossing and, hence, can
not capture entanglements. The topological constraints are represented by slip-springs. A compensating
pair potential is used in the SLSP model, to keep the static macromolecular properties unaltered
upon the introduction of slip-springs. The static and kinetic parameters of the SLSP model are determined
based on the lower level simulation models. Particularly, matching the orientational autocorrelation
of the end-to-end vector, we determine the number of slip-springs and calibrate the timescale of
the SLSP model. As the test case, the hierarchical methodology is applied to $cis$-1,4-polybutadiene
(cPB) at 413 K. Dynamical properties of cPB melts are calculated for a broad range of molecular weights.
The calculations are compared, and found in good agreement, with experimental data from the literature.

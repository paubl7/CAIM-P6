The flattening of galaxy rotation curves in the weak gravity regime has been the center of scientific
debate for decades. The cold dark matter ($\rm CDM$) paradigm has been posited as the standard explanation,
where the mass of the dark halo $m(r) \sim r/Gn$ roughly increases linearly with radial distance
at large distances with $G$ the gravitational constant and $n$ a dimensionless parameter which
depends on the amount of baryonic matter $M$ within the galaxy. Despite numerous advances in modeling
galaxy formation and evolution within the Lambda-cold dark matter ($\Lambda{\rm CDM}$) model
in cosmology, a scientific consensus on the origin of the observed dependence of the dimensionless
parameter $n = (GMa_{0})^{-1/2}$ on the mass of baryonic matter $M$ within the galaxy (the Tully-Fisher
relation), and the connection of the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ to the acceleration parameter
$a_{0} \sim (\Lambda/3)^{1/2}$ remains elusive. Here, we propose relativistic equations of gravity
($\nabla_{\nu}\mathcal{K}^{\nu}_{\,\,\mu} = 8\pi GM\Psi^{*}\mathcal{D}_{\mu}\Psi$, where
$\mathcal{K}_{\mu\nu}$ is a Hermitian tensor, $\mathcal{D}_{\mu}$ a covariant derivative and
$\Psi$ is a complex-valued function) which we show to not only contain Einstein Field Equations
but also satisfy the Tully-Fisher relation. In the weak field limit, the gravity equations reduce
to a theory of $n$ bosons (Ginzburg Landau theory) where the order parameter $\Psi$ is normalized
as $\int_{0}^{1/a_{0}} dr\,4\pi r^2\Psi^*\Psi = n$ and $1/a_{0} \sim (\Lambda/3)^{-1/2}$ is
the cut-off radius comparable to the size of the de Sitter universe. Our investigations have significant
implications for the dark matter versus MOdified Newtonian Dynamics (MOND) debate, since we provide
a framework where the Tully-Fisher relation in galaxies is satisfied within the context of Einstein's
general relativity.

As ecosystems might lose their biodiversity and even change from the functional state to the extinct
state due to environmental degradation, resilience restoration thus plays an increasingly important
role in recovering the service and functions of the systems. The existence of alternative stable
states and the switches between them in ecological systems containing a single dynamical variable
has been substantially studied. Impeded by the difficulty of high dimensionality, nonlinearity,
and stochastic effects, however, there is little understanding of the bistability and transitions
for spatially-extended systems in noisy environment. We bridge the gap by successfully combining
nucleation theory and the theory about noise-induced transition, with which the transition and
resilience restoration can be explored in multi-variable systems. After applying it to four types
of lattice-based ecosystems, two cluster modes that exhibit different transition patterns are
distinguished by the system size and noise strength. Large systems under strong noise take less
time to complete transition, exhibiting the multi-cluster transition mode. In contrast, small
systems subjected to weak noise require more time, leading to the single-cluster mode. We show both
analytically and numerically that the recovering time for the single-cluster mode follows an exponential
distribution and that for the multi-cluster mode is almost fixed by spatial self-averaging. Our
study advances the understanding of the role of noise in ecological restorations. More importantly,
this approach is not restricted to ecosystems, but it can be generally used to study resilience and
transitions in various dynamical systems with alternative stable states.

Electron transport in magnetic orders and the magnetic orders dynamics have a mutual dependence,
which provides the key mechanisms in spin-dependent phenomena. Recently, antiferromagnetic
orders are focused on as the magnetic order, where current-induced spin-transfer torques, a typical
effect of electron transport on the magnetic order, have been debatable mainly because of the lack
of an analytic derivation based on quantum field theory. Here, we construct the microscopic theory
of spin-transfer torques on the slowly-varying staggered magnetization in antiferromagnets
with weak canting. In our theory, the electron is captured by bonding/antibonding states, each
of which is the eigenstate of the system, doubly degenerates, and spatially spreads to sublattices
because of electron hopping. The spin of the eigenstates depends on the momentum in general, and
a nontrivial spin-momentum locking arises for the case with no site inversion symmetry, without
considering any spin-orbit couplings. The spin current of the eigenstates includes an anomalous
component proportional to a kind of gauge field defined by derivatives in momentum space and induces
the adiabatic spin-transfer torques on the magnetization. Unexpectedly, we find that one of the
nonadiabatic torques has the same form as the adiabatic spin-transfer torque, while the obtained
forms for the adiabatic and nonadiabatic spin-transfer torques agree with the phenomenological
derivation based on the symmetry consideration. This finding suggests that the conventional explanation
for the spin-transfer torques in antiferromagnets should be changed. Our microscopic theory provides
a fundamental understanding of spin-related physics in antiferromagnets.

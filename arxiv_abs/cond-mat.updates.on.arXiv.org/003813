Understanding the pressure dependence of the nonlinear behavior of ultrasonically excited phospholipid
(PL)-stabilized NBs is important for optimizing US exposure parameters for implementations of
contrast enhanced ultrasound, critical to molecular imaging. The viscoelastic properties of
the shell can be controlled by introduction of membrane additives, such as propylene glycol as a
membrane softener or glycerol as a membrane stiffener. We report for the first time, the production
of high yield NBs with narrow dispersity and different shell properties. Through precise control
over size and shell structure, we show how these shell components interact with the phospholipid
membrane, change its structure, affect their viscoelastic properties, and consequently change
their acoustic response. A two-photon microscopy technique through a polarity-sensitive fluorescent
dye, C-laurdan, was utilized to gain insights on the effect of membrane additives to the membrane
structure. We report how the shell stiffness of NBs affects the pressure threshold (Pt) for the sudden
amplification in the scattered acoustic signal from NBs. For narrow size NBs with 200 nm mean size,
we find Pt to be between 123-245 kPa for the NBs with the most flexible membrane as assessed using C-Laurdan,
465-588 kPa for the NBs with intermediate stiffness and 588-710 kPa for the NBs with stiff membranes.
Numerical simulations of the NB dynamics are in good agreement with the experimental observations
confirming the dependence of acoustic response to shell properties, thereby substantiating further
the development in engineering the shell of UCAs. The viscoelastic dependent threshold behavior
can be utilized for significantly and selectively enhancing the diagnostic and therapeutic ultrasound
applications of potent narrow size NBs.

The exciting properties of micro- and nano-patterned surfaces found in natural species hide a virtually
endless potential of technological ideas, opening new opportunities for innovation and exploitation
in materials science and engineering. Due to the diversity of biomimetic surface functionalities,
inspirations from natural surfaces are interesting for a broad range of applications in engineering,
including phenomena of adhesion, friction, wear, lubrication, wetting phenomena, self-cleaning,
antifouling, antibacterial phenomena, thermoregulation and optics. Lasers are increasingly
proving to be promising tools for the precise and controlled structuring of materials at micro-
and nano-scales. When ultrashort-pulsed lasers are used, the optimal interplay between laser
and material parameters enables structuring down to the nanometer scale. Besides this, a unique
aspect of laser processing technology is the possibility for material modifications at multiple
(hierarchical) length scales, leading to the complex biomimetic micro- and nano-scale patterns,
while adding a new dimension to structure optimization. This article reviews the current state
of the art of laser processing methodologies, which are being used for the fabrication of bioinspired
artificial surfaces to realize extraordinary wetting, optical, mechanical, and biological-active
properties for numerous applications. The innovative aspect of laser functionalized biomimetic
surfaces for a wide variety of current and future applications is particularly demonstrated and
discussed. The article concludes with illustrating the wealth of arising possibilities and the
number of new laser micro/nano fabrication approaches for obtaining complex high-resolution
features, which prescribe a future where control of structures and subsequent functionalities
are beyond our current imagination.

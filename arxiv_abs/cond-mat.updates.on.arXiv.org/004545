Leo Szilard pointed out that Maxwell's demon can be replaced by machinery, thereby laying the foundation
for understanding the physical nature of information. Almost a hundred years later, Szilard's
information engine still serves as a canonical example, despite significant growth of the field
in the last decade. The demon's role can be reduced to mapping observable data to a meta-stable memory
which is then utilized to extract work. While Szilard showed that the map can be implemented mechanistically,
the map was chosen a priori. The choice of how to construct a meaningful memory constitutes the demon's
intelligence. Recently, it was shown that this can be automated as well. To that end, generalized,
partially observable information engines were introduced. They can run work extraction at a different
temperature, T' > T, from the memory forming process, thus allowing for the combined treatment of
heat- and information engines. Partial observability is ubiquitous in real world systems which
have limited sensor types and information acquisition bandwidths. Generalized, partially observable
information engines provide the basis for understanding the physical nature of information processing.
Here, we propose a simple model that nonetheless displays physical richness. A minor change to Szilard's
engine - inserting the divider at an angle - results in a family of partially observable Szilard engines.
Their analysis illustrates how the demon's intelligence can be automated. At fixed angle, there
is an optimal memory for each value of T'/T, enabling maximal engine efficiency. Those memories
are probabilistic maps. They are computed by an algorithm derived from minimizing dissipation.
We compare their quality to that of naive, deterministic quantizations of the observable data,
and connect the method of finding optimal data representations to the computation of a rate-distortion
function.

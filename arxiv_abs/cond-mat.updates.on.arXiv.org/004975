Motivated by previous works on a Floquet version of the PXP model [Mukherjee {\it et al.} Phys. Rev.
B 102, 075123 (2020), Mukherjee {\it et al.} Phys. Rev. B 101, 245107 (2020)], we study a one-dimensional
spin-$1/2$ lattice model with three-spin interactions in the same constrained Hilbert space (where
all configurations with two adjacent $S^z=\uparrow$ spins are excluded). We show that this model
possesses an extensive fragmentation of the Hilbert space which leads to a breakdown of thermalization
upon unitary evolution starting from a large class of simple initial states. Despite the non-integrable
nature of the Hamiltonian, many of its high-energy eigenstates admit a quasiparticle description.
A class of these, which we dub as "bubble eigenstates", have integer eigenvalues (including mid-spectrum
zero modes) and strictly localized quasiparticles while another class contains mobile quasiparticles
leading to a dispersion in momentum space. Other anomalous eigenstates that arise due to a {\it secondary}
fragmentation mechanism, including those that lead to flat bands in momentum space due to destructive
quantum interference, are also discussed. The consequences of adding a (non-commuting) staggered
magnetic field and a PXP term respectively to this model, where the former preserves the Hilbert
space fragmentation while the latter destroys it, are discussed. A Floquet version with time-dependent
staggered field also evades thermalization with additional features like freezing of exponentially
many states at special drive frequencies. Finally, we map the model to a $U(1)$ lattice gauge theory
coupled to dynamical fermions and discuss the interpretation of some of these anomalous states
in this language. A class of gauge-invariant states show reduced mobility of the elementary charged
excitations with only certain charge-neutral objects being mobile suggesting a connection to
fractons.

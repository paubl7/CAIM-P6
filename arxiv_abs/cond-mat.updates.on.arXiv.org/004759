Acetaminophen (APAP) or Paracetamol, despite its wide and common use for pain and fever symptoms,
shows a variety of side effects, toxic effects, and overdose effects. The most common form of toxic
effects of APAP is in the liver where phosphatidylcholine is the major component of the cell membrane
with additional associated functionalities. Although this is the case, the effects of APAP on pure
phospholipid membranes have been largely ignored. Here, we used DOPC, a commonly found phospholipid
in mammalian cell membranes to synthesize large unilamellar vesicles to investigate how the incorporation
of APAP changes pure lipid vesicle structure, morphology, and fluidity at different concentrations.
We used a combination of dynamic light scattering (DLS), small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering
(SANS, SAXS), cryo TEM for structural characterization, and neutron spin-echo (NSE) spectroscopy
to investigate dynamics. We showed that the incorporation of Acetaminophen in the lipid bilayer
significantly impacts the spherical phospholipid self-assembly in terms of its morphology as
well as influences the lipid content in the bilayer, causing a decrease in bending rigidity. We discussed
how the overall impact of APAP molecules on the pure lipid membrane may play a significant role in
the drug's mechanisms of action. Our results showed the incorporation of APAP reduces membrane
rigidity as well as changes the spherical unilamellar vesicles into much more irregularly shaped
vesicles. Although bilayer structure did not show much change when observed by SAXS, NSE and cryo-TEM
results showed the lipid dynamics change with the addition of APAP in the bilayer which causes the
overall decreased membrane rigidity. A strong effect on the lipid tail motion was also observed.

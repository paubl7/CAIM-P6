Topologically stable field configurations appear in many fields of physics, from elementary particles
to condensed matter and cosmology. During the last decade, chiral liquid crystals and chiral magnets
took on the role of model objects for experimental investigation of topological solitons and understanding
of their nonsingular field configurations. Here we introduce a paradigm of facile skyrmionic networks
with mutually-orthogonal orientations of constituent isolated skyrmions. Such networks are
envisioned as a novel concept of spintronic devices and are presumably responsible for precursor
phenomena near the ordering temperatures of bulk cubic helimagnets. In particular, we demonstrate
an interconversion between mutually orthogonal skyrmions: horizontal skyrmions swirl into an
intermediate spring-like states and subsequently squeeze into vertical skyrmions with both polarities.
Skyrmion tubes are also considered as building blocks for particle-like states with more involved
internal structure. A family of target-skyrmions, which includes an overlooked so far type with
a multiple topological charge, is formed owing to the tendency to minimize the interaction energy
between vertical and horizontal skyrmions. The conical phase serves as a suitable background for
considered skyrmion evolution. It substantializes the attracting skyrmion-skyrmion interaction
in the skyrmionic networks, shapes their internal structure and guides the nucleation processes.
Alternatively, intricate textural changes of isolated skyrmions result not only in the structural
deformations of a host conical state, but may lead to the formation of an exotic skyrmion order with
pairs of merons being the core of the game. Generically, the fundamental insights provided by this
work emphasize a three-dimensional character of skyrmion metamorphoses and can also be extended
to three-dimensional solitons, such as hopfions.

The origin of the intermediate anomalous metallic state in two-dimensional superconductor materials
remains enigmatic. In the present paper, we observe such a state in a series of $\sim$9.0 nm thick
Ta$_x$(SiO$_2$)$_{1-x}$ ($x$ being the volume fraction of Ta) nanogranular films. At zero field,
the $x$ $\gtrsim$ 0.75 films undergo a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition as transform
from normal to superconducing states upon cooling. For the $x$ $\lesssim$ 0.71 films, the resistance
increases with decreasing temperature from 2 K down to 40 mK. A normal state to anomalous metallic
state transition is observed in the $x$ $\simeq$ 0.73 film, i.e., near the transition temperature,
the resistance of the film decreases sharply upon cooling as if the system would cross over to superconducting
state, but then saturates to a value far less than that in normal state. When a small magnetic field
perpendicular to the film plane is applied, the anomalous metallic state occurs in the $x$ $\gtrsim$
0.75 films. It is found that both disorder and magnetic field can induce the transition from superconductor
to anomalous metal and their influences on the transition are similar. For the the magnetic field
induced case, we find the sheet resistance $R_{\square}(T,H)$ ($T$ and $H$ being the temperature
and the magnitude of magnetic field) data near the crossover from the anomalous metal to superconductor
and in the vicinity of the anomalous metal to insulator transition, respectively, obey unique scaling
laws deduced from the Bose-metal model. Our results strongly suggest that the anomalous metallic
state in the Ta$_x$(SiO$_2$)$_{1-x}$ granular films is bosonic and dynamical gauge field fluctuation
resulting from superconducting quantum fluctuations plays a key role in its formation.

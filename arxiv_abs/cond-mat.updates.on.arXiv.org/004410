Capillary microflows of liquid crystal phases are central to material, biological and bio-inspired
systems. Despite their fundamental and applied significance, a detailed understanding of the
stationary behaviour of nematic liquid crystals (NLC-s) in cylindrical capillaries is still lacking.
Here, using numerical simulations based on the continuum theory of Leslie, Ericksen and Parodi,
we investigate stationary NLC flows within cylindrical capillaries possessing homeotropic (normal)
and uniform planar anchoring conditions. By considering the material parameters of the flow-aligning
NLC, 5CB, we report that instead of the expected, unique director field monotonically approaching
the alignment angle over corresponding Ericksen numbers (dimensionless number capturing viscous
v/s elastic effects), a second solution emerges below a threshold flow rate (or applied pressure
gradient). We demonstrate that the onset of the second solution, a nematodynamic bifurcation yielding
energetically degenerate director tilts at the threshold pressure gradient, can be controlled
by the surface anchoring and the flow driving mechanism (pressure-driven or volume-driven). For
homeotropic surface anchoring, this alternate director field orients against the alignment angle
in the vicinity of the capillary center; while in the uniform planar case, the alternate director
field extends throughout the capillary volume, leading to reduction of the flow speed with increasing
pressure gradients. While the practical realization and utilization of such nematodynamic bifurcations
still await systematic exploration, signatures of the emergent rheology have been reported previously
within microfluidic environments, under both homeotropic (Sengupta et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 110,
048303, 2013) and planar anchoring conditions (Sengupta, Int. J. Mol. Sci. 14, 22826, 2013).

The development of complex functional materials poses a multi-objective optimization problem
in a large multidimensional parameter space. Solving it requires reproducible, user independent
laboratory work and intelligent preselection of experiments. However, experimental materials
science is a field where manual routines are still predominant, although other domains like pharmacy
or chemistry have long used robotics and automation. As the number of publications on Materials
Acceleration Platforms (MAPs) increases steadily, we review selected systems and fit them into
the stages of a general material development process to examine the evolution of MAPs. Subsequently
we present our approach to laboratory automation in materials science. We introduce AMANDA (Autonomous
Materials and Device Application Platform), a generic platform for distributed materials research
comprising a self-developed software backbone and several MAPs. One of them, LineOne (L1), is specifically
designed to produce and characterize solution processed thin-film devices like organic solar
cells (OSC). It is designed to perform precise closed-loop screenings of up to 272 device variations
per day yet allows further upscaling. Each individual solar cell is fully characterized and all
process steps are comprehensively documented. We want to demonstrate the capabilities of AMANDA
L1 with OSCs based on PM6:Y6 with 13.7% efficiency when processed in air. Further we discuss challenges
and opportunities of highly automated research platforms and elaborate on the future integration
of additional techniques, methods and algorithms in order to advance to fully autonomous self-optimizing
systems - a paradigm shift in functional materials development leading to the laboratory of the
future.

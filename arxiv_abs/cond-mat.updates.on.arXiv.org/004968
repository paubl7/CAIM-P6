Diffusion with stochastic resetting is a paradigm of resetting processes. Standard renewal or
master equation approach are typically used to study steady state and other transport properties
such as average, mean squared displacement etc. What remains less explored is the two time point
correlation functions whose evaluation is often daunting since it requires the implementation
of the exact time dependent probability density functions of the resetting processes which are
unknown for most of the problems. We adopt a different approach that allows us to write a stochastic
solution in the level of a single trajectory undergoing resetting. Moments and the autocorrelation
functions between any two times along the trajectory can then be computed directly using the laws
of total expectation. Estimation of autocorrelation functions turns out to be pivotal for investigating
the ergodic properties of various observables for this canonical model. In particular, we investigate
two observables (i) sample mean which is widely used in economics and (ii) time-averaged-mean-squared-displacement
(TAMSD) which is of acute interest in physics. We find that both diffusion and drift-diffusion processes
are ergodic at the mean level unlike their reset-free counterparts. In contrast, resetting renders
ergodicity breaking in the TAMSD while both the stochastic processes are ergodic when resetting
is absent. We quantify these behaviors with detailed analytical study and corroborate with extensive
numerical simulations. The current study provides an important baseline that unifies two different
approaches, used ubiquitously in economics and physics, for studying the ergodic properties in
diffusion with resetting. We believe that our results can be verified in single particle experimental
set-ups and thus have strong implications in the field of resetting.

The quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) effect in magnetic topological insulator (TI) represents a new
state of matter originated from the interplay between topology and magnetism. The defining characteristics
of the QAH ground state are the quantized Hall resistivity ($\rho_{yx}$) and vanishing longitudinal
resistivity ($\rho_{xx}$) in the absence of external magnetic field. A fundamental question concerning
the QAH effect is whether it is merely a zero-magnetic-field quantum Hall (QH) effect, or if it can
host unique quantum phases and phase transitions that are unavailable elsewhere. The most dramatic
departure of the QAH systems from other QH systems lies in the strong magnetic disorders that induce
spatially random magnetization. Because disorder and magnetism play pivotal roles in the phase
diagram of two-dimensional electron systems, the high degree of magnetic disorders in QAH systems
may create novel phases and quantum critical phenomena. In this work, we perform systematic transport
studies of a series of magnetic TIs with varied strength of magnetic disorders. We find that the ground
state of QAH effect can be categorized into two distinct classes: the QAH insulator and anomalous
Hall (AH) insulator phases, as the zero-magnetic-field counterparts of the QH liquid and Hall insulator
in the QH systems. In the low disorder limit of the QAH insulator regime, we observe a universal quantized
longitudinal resistance $\rho_{xx} = h/e^{2}$ at the coercive field. In the AH insulator regime,
we find that a magnetic field can drive it to the QAH insulator phase through a quantum critical point
with distinct scaling behaviors from that in the QH phase transition. We propose that the transmission
between chiral edge states at domain boundaries, tunable by disorder and magnetic fields, is the
key for determining the QAH ground state.

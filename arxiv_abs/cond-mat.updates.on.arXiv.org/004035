Phase transitions in dissipative quantum systems are intriguing because they are induced by the
interplay between coherent quantum and incoherent classical fluctuations. Here, we investigate
the crossover from a quantum to a classical absorbing phase transition arising in the quantum contact
process (QCP). The Lindblad equation contains two parameters, $\omega$ and $\kappa$, which adjust
the contributions of the quantum and classical effects, respectively. We find that in one dimension,
when the QCP starts from a homogeneous state with all active sites, there exists a critical line in
the region $0 \le \kappa < \kappa_*$ along which the exponent $\alpha$ (which is associated with
the density of active sites) decreases continuously from a quantum to the classical directed percolation
(DP) value. This behavior suggests that the quantum coherent effect remains to some extent near
$\kappa=0$. This anomalous crossover behavior allows us to measure the competition between the
quantum DP and classical DP effects using Rydberg atom experiments. However, when the QCP in one
dimension starts from a heterogeneous state with all inactive sites except for one active site,
all the critical exponents have the classical DP values for $\kappa \ge 0$. In two dimensions, anomalous
crossover behavior does not occur, and classical DP behavior appears in the entire region of $\kappa
\ge 0$ regardless of the initial configuration. Neural network machine learning is used to identify
the critical line and determine the correlation length exponent. Numerical simulations using
the quantum jump Monte Carlo technique and tensor network method are performed to determine all
the other critical exponents of the QCP. Finally, we remark that the behavior of the continuously
varying exponent is similar to that in the contact process with long-range interactions.

We present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of the pyrochlore Tb$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$,
an exemplary realization of a material whose properties are dominated by competition between magnetic
dipolar and electric quadrupolar correlations. The dipolar and quadrupolar correlations evolve
over three distinct regimes that we characterize via heat capacity, elastic and inelastic neutron
scattering. In the first regime, above $T^*=1.1$ K, significant quadrupolar correlations lead
to an intense inelastic mode that cannot be accounted for within a scenario with solely magnetic
dipole-dipole correlations. The onset of extended dipole correlations occurs in the intermediate
regime, between $T^*=1.1$ K and $T_c = 0.25$ K, with the formation of a collective paramagnetic state
characterized by extended ferromagnetic canted spin ice domains. Here, long-range order is impeded
not only by the usual frustration operating in classical spin ice systems, but also by a competition
between dipolar and quadrupolar correlations. Finally, in the lowest temperature regime, below
$T_c=0.25$ K, there is an abrupt and significant increase in the dipole ordered moment. The majority
of the ordered moment remains tied up in the ferromagnetic spin ice-like state, but an additional
$\mathbf{k}=(0,0,1)$ antiferromagnetic order parameter also develops. Simultaneously, the
spectral weight of the inelastic mode, which is a proxy for the quadrupolar correlations, is observed
to drop, indicating that dipole order ultimately wins out. Tb$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$ is therefore a remarkable
platform to study intertwined dipolar and quadrupolar correlations in a magnetically frustrated
system and provides important insights into the physics of the whole family of terbium pyrochlores.

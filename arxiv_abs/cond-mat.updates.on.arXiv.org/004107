The problem of inferring pair-wise and higher-order interactions in complex systems involving
large numbers of interacting variables, from observational data, is fundamental to many fields.
Known to the statistical physics community as the inverse problem, it has become accessible in recent
years due to real and simulated 'big' data being generated. Current approaches to the inverse problem
rely on parametric assumptions, physical approximations, e.g. mean-field theory, and ignoring
higher-order interactions which may lead to biased or incorrect estimates. We bypass these shortcomings
using a cross-disciplinary approach and demonstrate that none of these assumptions and approximations
are necessary: We introduce a universal, model-independent, and fundamentally unbiased estimator
of all-order symmetric interactions, via the non-parametric framework of Targeted Learning,
a subfield of mathematical statistics. Due to its universality, our definition is readily applicable
to any system at equilibrium with binary and categorical variables, be it magnetic spins, nodes
in a neural network, or protein networks in biology. Our approach is targeted, not requiring fitting
unnecessary parameters. Instead, it expends all data on estimating interactions, hence substantially
increasing accuracy. We demonstrate the generality of our technique both analytically and numerically
on (i) the 2-dimensional Ising model, (ii) an Ising-like model with 4-point interactions, (iii)
the Restricted Boltzmann Machine, and (iv) simulated individual-level human DNA variants and
representative traits. The latter demonstrates the applicability of this approach to discover
epistatic interactions causal of disease in population biomedicine.

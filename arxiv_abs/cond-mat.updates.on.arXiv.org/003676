For organic molecules adsorbed as well-oriented ultra-thin films on metallic surfaces, angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy has evolved into a technique called photoemission tomography (PT).
By approximating the final state of the photoemitted electron as a free electron, PT uses the angular
dependence of the photocurrent, a so-called momentum map or k-map, and interprets it as the Fourier
transform of the initial state's molecular orbital, thereby gains insights into the geometric
and electronic structure of organic/metal interfaces. In this contribution, we present kMap.py
which is a Python program that enables the user, via a PyQt-based graphical user interface, to simulate
photoemission momentum maps of molecular orbitals and to perform a one-to-one comparison between
simulation and experiment. Based on the plane wave approximation for the final state, simulated
momentum maps are computed numerically from a fast Fourier transform of real space molecular orbital
distributions, which are used as program input and taken from density functional calculations.
The program allows the user to vary a number of simulation parameters such as the final state kinetic
energy, the molecular orientation or the polarization state of the incident light field. Moreover,
also experimental photoemission data can be loaded into the program enabling a direct visual comparison
as well as an automatic optimization procedure to determine structural parameters of the molecules
or weights of molecular orbitals contributions. With an increasing number of experimental groups
employing photoemission tomography to study adsorbate layers, we expect kMap.py to serve as an
ideal analysis software to further extend the applicability of PT.

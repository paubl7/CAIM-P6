Recently, we employed electronic polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy to reveal the strongly
correlated excitonic insulator (EI) nature of Ta2NiSe5, Volkov et al. [arXiv:2007.07344], and
also showed that for Ta$_2$Ni(Se$_{1-x}$S$_x$)$_5$ alloys the critical excitonic fluctuations
diminish with sulfur concentration x exposing a cooperating lattice instability that takes over
for large x, Volkov et al. [arXiv:2104.07032]. Here we focus on the lattice dynamics of this EI family.
We identify all Raman-active optical phonons of fully symmetric and ac-quadrupole-like symmetries
and study their evolution with temperature and sulfur concentration. We demonstrate the change
of selection rules at temperatures below the orthorhombic-to-monoclinic transition at Tc(x)
that is related to the EI phase. We find that Tc(x) decrease monotonically from 328 K for Ta2NiSe5
to 120 K for Ta2NiS5 and that the magnitude of lattice distortion also decreases with the sulfur concentration
x. For x < 0.7, the two lowest-frequency B2g phonon modes show strongly asymmetric lineshapes at
high temperatures due to Fano interference with the broad excitonic continuum present in a semimetallic
state. Within the framework of extended Fano model, we develop a quantitative description of the
interacting exciton-phonon excitation lineshape, enabling us to derive the intrinsic phonon
parameters and determine the exciton-phonon interaction strength, that affects the transition
temperature Tc(x). We also observe signatures of the acoustic mode scattered assisted by the structural
domain walls formed below Tc. Based on our results, we additionally present a consistent interpretation
of the origin of oscillations observed in time-resolved pump-probe experiments.

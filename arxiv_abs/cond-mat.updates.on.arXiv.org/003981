We derive the exact insulator ground states of the projected Hamiltonian of magic-angle twisted
bilayer graphene (TBG) flat bands with Coulomb interactions in various limits, and study the perturbations
away from these limits. We define the (first) chiral limit where the AA stacking hopping is zero,
and a flat limit with exactly flat bands. In the chiral-flat limit, the TBG Hamiltonian has a U(4)$\times$U(4)
symmetry, and we find that the exact ground states at integer filling $-4\le \nu\le 4$ relative to
charge neutrality are Chern insulators of Chern numbers $\nu_C=4-|\nu|,2-|\nu|,\cdots,|\nu|-4$,
all of which are degenerate. This confirms recent experiments where Chern insulators are found
to be competitive low-energy states of TBG. When the chiral-flat limit is reduced to the nonchiral-flat
limit which has a U(4) symmetry, we find $\nu=0,\pm2$ has exact ground states of Chern number $0$,
while $\nu=\pm1,\pm3$ has perturbative ground states of Chern number $\nu_C=\pm1$, which are
U(4) ferromagnetic. In the chiral-nonflat limit with a different U(4) symmetry, different Chern
number states are degenerate up to second order perturbations. In the realistic nonchiral-nonflat
case, we find that the perturbative insulator states with Chern number $\nu_C=0$ ($0<|\nu_C|<4-|\nu|$)
at integer fillings $\nu$ are fully (partially) intervalley coherent, while the insulator states
with Chern number $|\nu_C|=4-|\nu|$ are valley polarized. However, for $0<|\nu_C|\le4-|\nu|$,
the fully intervalley coherent states are highly competitive (0.005meV/electron higher). At
nonzero magnetic field $|B|>0$, a first-order phase transition for $\nu=\pm1,\pm2$ from Chern
number $\nu_C=\text{sgn}(\nu B)(2-|\nu|)$ to $\nu_C=\text{sgn}(\nu B)(4-|\nu|)$ is expected,
which agrees with recent experimental observations. Lastly, the TBG Hamiltonian reduces into
an extended Hubbard model in the stabilizer code limit.

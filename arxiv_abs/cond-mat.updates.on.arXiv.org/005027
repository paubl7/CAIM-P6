Utilizing the first-principles calculations together with the group theory analysis, we systematically
investigate the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, magneto-optical effect, and anomalous
transport properties (including anomalous Hall, Nernst, and thermal Hall effects) of monolayer
and bilayer Fe$_n$GeTe$_2$ ($n$ = 3, 4, 5). The monolayer Fe$_n$GeTe$_2$ ($n$ = 3, 4, 5) exhibits
the out-of-plane, in-plane, and in-plane ferromagnetic orders with considerable magnetocrystalline
anisotropy energies of -3.17, 4.42, and 0.58 meV/f.u., respectively. Ferromagnetic order is predicted
in bilayer Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$ while antiferromagnetic order prefers in bilayer Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ and
Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$. The group theory analysis reveals that in addition to monolayer ferromagnetic
Fe$_n$GeTe$_2$ ($n$ = 3, 4, 5), the magneto-optical and anomalous transport phenomena surprisingly
exist in bilayer antiferromagnetic Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$, which is much rare in realistic collinear
antiferromagnets. If spin magnetic moments of monolayer and bilayer Fe$_n$GeTe$_2$ are reoriented
from the in-plane to out-of-plane direction, the magneto-optical and anomalous transport properties
enhance significantly, presenting strong magnetic anisotropy. We also demonstrate that the anomalous
Hall effect decreases with the temperature increases. The gigantic anomalous Nernst and thermal
Hall effects are found in monolayer and bilayer ferromagnetic Fe$_n$GeTe$_2$, and the largest
anomalous Nernst and thermal Hall conductivities, respectively, of -3.31 A/Km and 0.22 W/Km at
130 K are observed in bilayer ferromagnetic Fe$_4$GeTe$_2$. Especially, bilayer antiferromagnetic
Fe$_5$GeTe$_2$ exhibits large zero-temperature anomalous Hall conductivity of 2.63 e$^2$/h
as well as anomalous Nernst and thermal Hall conductivities of 2.76 A/Km and 0.10 W/Km at 130 K, respectively.

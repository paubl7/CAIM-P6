Soon after its theoretical prediction, striped-density states in the presence of synthetic spin-orbit
coupling have been realized in Bose-Einstein condensates of ultracold, neutral atoms. The achievement
opens up new avenues to explore the interplay of superfluidity and crystalline order in the search
for supersolid features and materials. The system considered is essentially made of two linearly
coupled Bose-Einstein condensates, that is a pseudo-spin-$1/2$ system, subject to a spin-dependent
gauge field $\sigma_z \hbar k_\ell$. Under these conditions the stripe phase is achieved when the
linear coupling $\hbar\Omega/2$ is small against the gauge energy $m\Omega/\hbar k_\ell^2<1$.
The resulting density stripes have been interpreted as a standing-wave, interference pattern
with approximate wavenumber $2k_\ell$. Here, we show that the emergence of the stripe phase is induced
by an array of Josephson vortices living in the junction defined by the linear coupling. As happens
in superconducting junctions subject to external magnetic fields, a vortex array is the natural
response of the superfluid system to the presence of a gauge field. Also similarly to superconductors,
the Josephson currents and their associated vortices can be present as a metastable state in the
absence of gauge field. We provide closed-form solutions to the 1D mean field equations that account
for such vortex arrays. The underlying Josephson currents coincide with the analytical solutions
to the sine-Gordon equation for the relative phase of superconducting junctions. Additionally,
we introduce new striped-density states that do not rely on particle currents, and are built upon
staggered arrays of bright solitons, despite the repulsive interatomic interactions.

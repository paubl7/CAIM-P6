We consider theoretically the influence of the flexoelectric coupling on the spatial distribution
and temperature behavior of spontaneous polarization for several types of stable domain structure
in thin ferroelectric films, such as stripe domains and vortices.Finite element modelling (FEM)
for BaTiO3 films and analytical calculations within the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach
reveals that an out-of-plane polarization component can be very sensitive to the flexoelectric
coupling for periodic quasi-2D stripe domains and 3D vortex-antivortex structures.However,
the influence is rather different for these structures. The flexoelectric coupling increases
significantly the amplitude of a small out-of-plane polarization component in the stripe domains,
and the "up" or "down" direction of the component is defined by the sign of the flexoelectric coefficients.Concerning
the vortex-antivortex pairs, their antivortices with in-plane anti-circulation have smooth
wide dipolar cores through the entire film, whose shape and other features are almost insensitive
to the coupling.The vortices with in-plane vorticity have spike-like cores with an out-of-plane
quadrupolar moment induced by the flexoelectric coupling. The cores are located near the film-dead
layer interfaces.FEM results corroborated by analytical calculations prove that a change of the
flexoelectric coefficient sign leads to a reorientation of the core axial polarization, making
the flexo-sensitive 3D vortices similar to the recently introduced "flexons" in cylindrical nanoparticles.The
relatively wide temperature range (from 200 to 400 K) of the flexo-sensitive vortices' existence
gives us the hope that they can be observed experimentally in thin ferroelectric films by scanning
probe and nonlinear optical microscopy methods.

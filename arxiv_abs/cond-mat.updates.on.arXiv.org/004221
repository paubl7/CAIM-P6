At high magnetic fields, monolayer graphene hosts competing phases distinguished by their breaking
of the approximate SU(4) isospin symmetry. Recent experiments have observed an even denominator
fractional quantum Hall state thought to be associated with a transition in the underlying isospin
order from a spin-singlet charge density wave at low magnetic fields to an antiferromagnet at high
magnetic fields, implying that a similar transition must occur at charge neutrality. However,
this transition does not generate contrast in typical electrical transport or thermodynamic measurements
and no direct evidence for it has been reported, despite theoretical interest arising from its potentially
unconventional nature. Here, we measure the transmission of ferromagnetic magnons through the
two dimensional bulk of clean monolayer graphene. Using spin polarized fractional quantum Hall
states as a benchmark, we find that magnon transmission is controlled by the detailed properties
of the low-momentum spin waves in the intervening Hall fluid, which is highly density dependent.
Remarkably, as the system is driven into the antiferromagnetic regime, robust magnon transmission
is restored across a wide range of filling factors consistent with Pauli blocking of fractional
quantum hall spin-wave excitations and their replacement by conventional ferromagnetic magnons
confined to the minority graphene sublattice. Finally, using devices in which spin waves are launched
directly into the insulating charge-neutral bulk, we directly detect the hidden phase transition
between bulk insulating charge density wave and a canted antiferromagnetic phases at charge neutrality,
completing the experimental map of broken-symmetry phases in monolayer graphene.

Covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have attracted significant attention due to their chemical
versatility combined with a significant number of potential applications. Of particular interest
are two-dimensional COFs, where the organic building units are linked by covalent bonds within
a plane. Most properties of these COFs are determined by the relative arrangement of neighboring
layers. These are typically found to be laterally displaced, which, for example, reduces the electronic
coupling between the layers. In the present contribution, we use dispersion-corrected density-functional
theory to elucidate the origin of that displacement, showing that the common notion that the displacement
is a consequence of electrostatic repulsions of polar building blocks can be misleading. For the
representative case of COF-1, we find that electrostatic and van der Waals interactions would,
actually, favor a cofacial arrangement of the layers and that Pauli repulsion is the crucial factor
causing the serrated AA stacking. A more in-depth analysis of the electrostatic contribution reveals
that the "classical" Coulomb repulsion between the boroxine building blocks of COF-1 suggested
by chemical intuition does exist, but is overcompensated by attractive effects due to charge-penetration
in the phenylene units. The situation becomes more involved when additionally allowing the interlayer
distance to relax for each displacement, as then the different distance-dependences of the various
types of interactions come into play. The overall behavior calculated for COF-1 is recovered for
several additional COFs with differently sized pi-systems and topologies, implying that the presented
results are of more general relevance.

Squeezed, nonclassical states are an integral tool of quantum metrology due to their ability to
push the sensitivity of a measurement apparatus beyond the limits of classical states. While their
creation in light has become a standard technique, the production of squeezed states of the collective
excitations in gases of ultracold atoms, the phonons of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), is a comparably
recent problem. This task is continuously gaining relevance with a growing number of proposals
for BEC-based quantum metrological devices and the possibility to apply them in the detection of
gravitational waves. The objective of this thesis is to find whether the recently described effect
of an oscillating external potential on a uniform BEC can be exploited to generate two-mode squeezed
phonon states, given present day technology. This question brings together elements of a range
of fields beyond cold atoms, such as general relativity and Efimov physics. To answer it, the full
transformation caused by the oscillating potential on an initially thermal phononic state is considered,
allowing to find an upper bound for the magnitude of this perturbation as well as to quantify the quality
of the final state with respect to its use in metrology. These findings are then applied to existing
experiments to judge the feasibility of the squeezing scheme and while the results indicate that
they are not well suited for it, a setup is proposed that allows for its efficient implementation
and seems within experimental reach. In view of the vast parameter space leaving room for optimization,
the considered mechanism could find applications not only in the gravitational wave detector that
originally motivated this work, but more generally in the field of quantum metrology based on ultracold
atoms.

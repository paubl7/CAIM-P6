A Z2 quantum spin liquid hosts one of the simplest topological orders and exhibits many exotic properties
due to long-range quantum entanglements. Its elementary excitations are anyons such as spinons
carrying fractionalized spin quantum number and visons carrying emergent Z2 gauge flux. However,
experimental detection of these anyons remains elusive. The difficulties lie not only in the fact
that there exists few candidates for Z2 quantum spin liquids but also in that visons are magnetically
inert hence immune to available experimental techniques. Here we have studied the spin excitations
and specific heats of kagome-lattice antiferromagnet Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$FBr and Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$FBr,
which consists of two-dimensional Cu$^{2+}$ kagome layers with either Cu$^{2+}$ or Zn$^{2+}$
ions in between. By combining the first principle calculations and inelastic neutron scattering
data in the former, we show that the dominate couplings in Cu$_4$(OH)$_6$FBr are between the nearest
neighbor spins within the kagome planes, and the kagome and interlayer spin systems are essentially
decoupled above the antiferromagnetic transition temperature. The intrinsic spin excitations
and specific heats of the kagome layers for Cu$_3$Zn(OH)$_6$FBr are thus derived by removing the
contributions from the residual interlayer Cu$^{2+}$ magnetic impurities. Accordingly, the
kagome spin system exhibits spin continuum with momentum-dependent spin gap and a large magnetic
entropy at low temperature that is insensitive to magnetic field, which can be understood as the
evidences of spinons and visons in this kagome quantum spin liquid candidate. Our results suggest
the existence of the Z2 anyons in the material, and therefore provide a comprehensive set of evidences
for the Z2 topological order in kagome quantum spin liquid and bring their choreographed entanglement
dances to the stage of real materials.

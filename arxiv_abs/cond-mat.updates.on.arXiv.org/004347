The nature of the Fermi surface observed in the recently discovered family of unconventional insulators
starting with SmB$_6$ and subsequently YbB$_{12}$ is a subject of intense inquiry. Here we shed
light on this question by comparing quantum oscillations between the high magnetic field-induced
metallic regime in YbB$_{12}$ and the unconventional insulating regime. In the field-induced
metallic regime beyond 47 T, we find prominent quantum oscillations in the contactless resistivity
characterised by multiple frequencies up to at least 3000 T and heavy effective masses up to at least
17 $m_\text{e}$, characteristic of an $f$-electron hybridised metallic Fermi surface. The growth
of quantum oscillation amplitude at low temperatures in electrical transport and magnetic torque
in insulating YbB$_{12}$ is closely similar to the Lifshitz-Kosevich low temperature growth of
quantum oscillation amplitude in field-induced metallic YbB$_{12}$, pointing to an origin of
quantum oscillations in insulating YbB$_{12}$ from in-gap neutral low energy excitations. The
field-induced metallic regime of YbB$_{12}$ is characterised by more Fermi surface sheets of heavy
quasiparticle effective mass that emerge in addition to the heavy Fermi surface sheets yielding
multiple quantum oscillation frequencies below 1000 T observed in both insulating and metallic
regimes. We thus observe a heavy multi-component Fermi surface in which $f$-electron hybridisation
persists from the unconventional insulating to the field-induced metallic regime of YbB$_{12}$,
which is in distinct contrast to the unhybridised conduction electron Fermi surface observed in
the case of the unconventional insulator SmB$_6$. Our findings require a different theoretical
model of neutral in-gap low energy excitations in which the $f$-electron hybridisation is retained
in the case of the unconventional insulator YbB$_{12}$.

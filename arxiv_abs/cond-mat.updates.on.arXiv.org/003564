We report a complementary experimental and theoretical characterization of (110) oriented YPdBi
thin-film, grown on MgO (100) substrate, thus engineering a tensile strain ~3.12% in the YPdBi lattice.
The DFT based first principles simulations are used to demonstrate the strain tunable nature (from
trivial to inverted) of YPdBi band structure. Calculations of Z2 invariants confirm the topological
non-triviality in the strained lattice. The transport measurements on the film reveal the usual
semi-metallic behavior in the temperature range 3k to 350K. A sharp drop in resistivity is observed
at ~ 2.2 K with critical temperature ~1.25 K; however, the resistivity remains finite even down to
0.3 K. This down-turn in resistivity at 2.2 K is found to be magnetic field dependent, finally vanishing
at B ~ 5 T. The magneto-transport data show all features of topologically non-trivial surface; viz,
a sharp cusp around the low magnetic field region, indicating 2D weak anti-localization (alpha~
- 0.50 and L_phi~T^-0.48) and Shubnikov de-Hass (SdH) oscillations at high magnetic fields, in
the temperature range 3K to 10K. A (110) oriented semi-infinite slab of strained YPdBi, simulated
to mimic the thin film, shows the presence of electronic pockets with very small effective mass electrons
near the Fermi level. Identifying these Fermi pockets as the origin of very mobile electrons on (110)
surface, we reach a value of Efs ~ 88meV; which is in good agreement with the value (EFs~ 48meV) extracted
from the SdH oscillations observed at high magnetic fields in the magneto-resistance data. Our
results indicate a possible topological/unconventional superconducting state below 2.2 K and
conductance through topological semi-metallic thin film surface above 2.2K. Hence, in this work,
we clearly demonstrate the evidences of strain induced topological non-triviality in the YPdBi
thin-films.

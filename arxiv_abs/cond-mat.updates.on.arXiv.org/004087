A theoretically supported experimental study of the (1-x)LaFeO3.xLaMnO3 (LFO-LMO) solid solution
is being reported for the first time which reveals a phase transformation from the Pbnm and R3-c phase
at a chemical composition of x=0.625. Correlation of octahedral distortion and phase transition
was extensively investigated using x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Raman and x-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements and density functional theory (DFT) calculation. A detailed study of the structural
lattice parameters, bond lengths, bond angles have been done, supported by valence state and electronic
properties studies. All the above parameters show a correlated modification to the phase transition.
The distortion and tilting of the BO6 octahedra has been studied as a function of different Fe:Mn
content and expressed by Glazer representation from the refined Crystallographic Information
Files (CIF). The angle of tilting from the central non-tilted position also shows a correlated modification
with the phase transformation. The valence state and size of cations influences the octahedral
tilting. Octahedral volume is reduced as the entire perovskite structure is relatively flattened
with increasing Mn-content implying a flattening of both the BO6 octahedra and the La8O6 cage. The
vibrational properties were studied experimentally and supported by DFT phonon calculations,
detailing the displacement pattern (eigen vectors) revealing considerable insight into the lattice
dynamics of the compounds. The optoelectronic modifications in the band properties were studied
experimentally and supported with theory. Hence, this manuscript is a in-depth analysis of the
structure correlated phase transition of the LFO-LMO solid solution.

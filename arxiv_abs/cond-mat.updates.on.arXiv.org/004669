pyGDM is a python toolkit for electro-dynamical simulations of individual nano-structures, based
on the Green Dyadic Method (GDM). pyGDM uses the concept of a generalized propagator, which allows
to solve cost-efficiently monochromatic problems with a large number of varying illumination
conditions such as incident angle scans or focused beam raster-scan simulations. We provide an
overview of new features added since the initial publication [Wiecha, Computer Physics Communications
233, pp.167-192 (2018)]. The updated version of pyGDM is implemented in pure python, removing the
former dependency on fortran-based binaries. In the course of this re-write, the toolkit's internal
architecture has been completely redesigned to offer a much wider range of possibilities to the
user such as the choice of the dyadic Green's functions describing the environment. A new class of
dyads allows to perform 2D simulations of infinitely long nanostructures. While the Green's dyads
in pyGDM are based on a quasistatic description for interfaces, we also provide as new external python
package pyGDM2_retard a module with retarded Green's tensors for an environment with two interfaces.
We have furthermore added functionalities for simulations using fast-electron excitation, namely
electron energy loss spectroscopy and cathodoluminescence. Along with several further new tools
and improvements, the update includes also the possibility to calculate the magnetic field and
the magnetic LDOS inside nanostructures, field-gradients in- and outside a nanoparticle, optical
forces or the chirality of nearfields. All new functionalities remain compatible with the evolutionary
optimization module of pyGDM for nano-photonics inverse design.

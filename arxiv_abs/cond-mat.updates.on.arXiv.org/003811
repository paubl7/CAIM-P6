We study high-harmonic generation (HHG) in the one-dimensional Hubbard model in order to understand
its relation to elementary excitations as well as the similarities and differences to semiconductors.
The simulations are based on the infinite time-evolving block decimation (iTEBD) method and exact
diagonalization. We clarify that the HHG originates from the doublon-holon recombination, and
the scaling of the cutoff frequency is consistent with a linear dependence on the external field.
We demonstrate that the subcycle features of the HHG can be reasonably described by a phenomenological
three step model for a doublon-holon pair. We argue that the HHG in the one-dimensional Mott insulator
is closely related to the dispersion of the doublon-holon pair with respect to its relative momentum,
which is not necessarily captured by the single-particle spectrum due to the many-body nature of
the elementary excitations. For the comparison to semiconductors, we introduce effective models
obtained from the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, i.e. a strong-coupling expansion, which
allows us to disentangle the different processes involved in the Hubbard model: intraband dynamics
of doublons and holons, interband dipole excitations, and spin exchanges. These demonstrate the
formal similarity of the Mott system to the semiconductor models in the dipole gauge, and reveal
that the spin dynamics, which does not directly affect the charge dynamics, can reduce the HHG intensity.
We also show that the long-range component of the intraband dipole moment has a substantial effect
on the HHG intensity, while the correlated hopping terms for the doublons and holons essentially
determine the shape of the HHG spectrum. A new numerical method to evaluate single-particle spectra
within the iTEBD method is also introduced.

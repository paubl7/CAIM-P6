We review the topological phenomena that have been recently uncovered in antiferromagnetic materials.
The scope of this work covers electronic and magnonic transport, as well as topologically non-trivial
magnetic solitons and fractional excitations. We emphasize that while the term topology refers
to a global property that reflects the gauge flux endowed by a quantum state, it is routinely used
to designate properties emerging from the local geometry of the quantum states in momentum and spin
spaces. In this review, we adopt this convention. In the introduction, we provide a short overview
of antiferromagnetic spintronics, briefly highlighting its main features, and discuss the difference
between topology and geometry. In the second section, we describe of the symmetry properties of
antiferromagnets and how they impact their band structure, Berry curvature and conductivity tensor.
In the third section, we show how these symmetries generate anomalous electronic and magnonic transport,
focusing on the most recently discovered phenomena: anomalous Hall effect, magnetic spin Hall
effect, crystal Hall effect and their magnonic counterpart. In the fourth section, we discuss the
realization of electronic and magnonic topological insulators based on antiferromagnetic materials.
In the fifth section, the emergence of topological solitons in antiferromagnets in one and two dimensions
is addressed and their dynamical properties are presented. In the sixth section, we describe the
emergence of topologically non-trivial magnetic excitations in quantum antiferromagnets, focusing
on eloquent examples such as fermionic spinons in kagom\'e lattices, Majorana fermions in Kitaev
honeycomb lattices and magnetic monopole in pyrochlores. In the seventh section, we provide perspectives
on the promises of the field.

Amorphous polymer derived silicon oxycarbide (SiOC) is an attractive candidate for Lithium ion
battery anodes, as an alternative to graphite, which is limited to a theoretical capacity of 372
mAh/g. However, SiOC tends to exhibit poor transport properties and cycling performance as a result
of sparsely distributed carbon clusters and inefficient active sites. To overcome these limitations,
we designed and fabricated a layered graphene SiOC heterostructure by solvent assisted infiltration
of a polymeric precursor into a modified three dimensional graphene aerogel skeleton. The use of
a high melting point solvent facilitated the precursors freeze drying, which following pyrolysis
yielded SiOC as a layer supported on the surface of nitrogen doped reduced graphene oxide aerogels.
The fabrication method employed here modifies the composition and microstructure of the SiOC phase.
Among the studied materials, the highest levels of performance were obtained for a sample of moderate
SiOC content, in which the graphene network constituted 19.8 wt % of the system. In these materials,
a stable reversible charge capacity of 751 mAh/g was achieved at low charge rates. At high charge
rates of 1480 mA/g, the capacity retention was ca. 95% (352 mAh/g) after 1000 consecutive cycles.
At all rates, Coulombic efficiencies greater than 99% were maintained following the first cycle.
Performance across all indicators was majorly improved in the graphene aerogel SiOC nanocomposites,
compared with unsupported SiOC. The performance was attributed to mechanisms across multiple
length scales. The presence of oxygen rich SiO4-xCx tetrahedral units and a continuous free carbon
network within the SiOC provides sites for reversible lithiation, while high ionic and electronic
transport is provided by the layered graphene SiOC heterostructure.

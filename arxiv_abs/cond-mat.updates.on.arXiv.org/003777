We study the low-frequency properties of the bulk photovoltaic effect in topological semimetals.
The bulk photovoltaic effect is a nonlinear optical effect that generates DC photocurrents under
uniform irradiation, allowed by noncentrosymmetry. It is a promising mechanism for a terahertz
photodetection based on topological semimetals. Here, we systematically investigate the low-frequency
behavior of the second-order optical conductivity in point-node semimetals. Through symmetry
and power-counting analysis, we show that Dirac and Weyl points with tilted cones show the leading
low-frequency divergence. In particular, we find new divergent behaviors of the conductivity
of Dirac and Weyl points under circularly polarized light, where the conductivity scales as $\omega^{-2}$
and $\omega^{-1}$ near the gap-closing point in two and three dimensions, respectively. We provide
a further perspective on the low-frequency bulk photovoltaic effect by revealing the complete
quantum geometric meaning of the second-order optical conductivity tensor. The bulk photovoltaic
effect has two origins, which are the transition of electron position and the transition of electron
velocity during the optical excitation, and the resulting photocurrents are respectively called
the shift current and the injection current. Based on an analysis of two-band models, we show that
the injection current is controlled by the quantum metric and Berry curvature, whereas the shift
current is governed by the Christoffel symbols near the gap-closing points in semimetals. Finally,
for further demonstrations of our theory beyond simple two-band models, we perform first-principles
calculations on magnetic Dirac semimetal MnGeO$_3$and Weyl semimetal PrGeAl. Our work brings
out new insights into the structure of nonlinear optical responses as well as for the design of semimetal-based
terahertz photodetectors.

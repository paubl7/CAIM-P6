The electronic and local structural properties of CuO under pressure have been investigated by
means of X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at Cu K edge and ab-initio calculations, up to 17 GPa.
The crystal structure of CuO consists of Cu motifs within CuO$_4$ square planar units and two elongated
apical Cu-O bonds. The CuO$_4$ square planar units are stable in the studied pressure range, with
Cu-O distances that are approximately constant up to 5 GPa, and then decrease slightly up to 17 GPa.
In contrast, the elongated Cu-O apical distances decrease continuously with pressure in the studied
range. An anomalous increase of the mean square relative displacement (EXAFS Debye Waller, \sigma$^2$)
of the elongated Cu-O path is observed from 5 GPa up to 13 GPa, when a drastic reduction takes place
in \sigma$^2$. This is interpreted in terms of local dynamic disorder along the apical Cu-O path.
At higher pressures (P>13 GPa), the local structure of Cu$^{2+}$ changes from a 4-fold square planar
to a 4+2 Jahn-Teller distorted octahedral ion. We interpret these results in terms of the tendency
of the Cu$^{2+}$ ion to form favorable interactions with the apical O atoms. Also, the decrease in
Cu-O apical distance caused by compression softens the normal mode associated with the out-of-plane
Cu movement. CuO is predicted to have an anomalous rise in permittivity with pressure as well as modest
piezoelectricity in the 5-13 GPa pressure range. In addition, the near edge features in our XAS experiment
show a discontinuity and a change of tendency at 5 GPa. For P < 5 GPa the evolution of the edge shoulder
is ascribed to purely electronic effects which also affect the charge transfer integral. This is
linked to a charge migration from the Cu to O, but also to an increase of the energy band gap, which show
a change of tendency occurring also at 5 GPa.

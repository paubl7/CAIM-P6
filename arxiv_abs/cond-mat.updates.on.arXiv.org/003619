We consider a finite two-dimensional Heisenberg triangular spin lattice at different degrees
of anisotropy coupled to a dissipative Lindblad environment obeying the Born-Markovian constrain
at finite temperature. We show how applying an inhomogeneous magnetic field to the system may significantly
affect the entanglement distribution and properties among the spins in the asymptotic steady state
of the system. Particularly, applying an inhomogeneous field with an inward (growing) gradient
toward the central spin is found to considerably enhance the nearest neighbor entanglement and
its robustness to the thermal dissipative decay effect in the completely anisotropic (Ising) system,
whereas all the beyond nearest neighbor entanglements vanish entirely. Applying the same field
to a partially anisotropic (XYZ) system, does not only enhance the nearest neighbor entanglements
and their robustness but also all the beyond nearest neighbor ones. Nevertheless, the inhomogeneity
of the field shows no effect on the asymptotic behavior of the entanglement in the isotropic (XXX)
system, which vanishes under any system configuration. Moreover, the same inhomogeneous field
exhibits the most influential impact, compared with the other ones, on the the spin dynamics as well.
Although in the isotropic system the spins relax to a separable (disentangled) steady state with
all the spins reaching a common spin state regardless of the field inhomogeneity, the spins in the
steady state of the completely anisotropic system reach different distinguished spin states depending
on their positions in the lattice. However, in the XYZ system, though the anisotropy is lower, the
spin states become even more distinguished, accompanying the long range quantum correlation across
the system, which is a sign of a critical behavior taking place at this combination of system anisotropy
and field inhomogeneity.

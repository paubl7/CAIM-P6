The relativistic charge carriers in monolayer graphene can be manipulated in manners akin to conventional
optics (electron-optics): angle-dependent Klein tunneling collimates an electron beam (analogous
to a laser), while a Veselago refraction process focuses it (analogous to an optical lens). Both
processes have been previously investigated, but the collimation and focusing efficiency have
been reported to be relatively low even in state-of-the-art ballistic pn-junction devices. These
limitations prevented the realization of more advanced quantum devices based on electron-optical
interference, while understanding of the underlying physics remains elusive. Here, we present
a novel device architecture of a graphene microcavity defined by carefully-engineered local strain
and electrostatic fields. We create a controlled electron-optic interference process at zero
magnetic field as a consequence of consecutive Veselago refractions in the microcavity and provide
direct experimental evidence through low-temperature electrical transport measurements. The
experimentally observed first-, second-, and third-order interference peaks agree quantitatively
with the Veselago physics in a microcavity. In addition, we demonstrate decoherence of the interference
by an external magnetic field, as the cyclotron radius becomes comparable to the interference length
scale. For its application in electron-optics, we utilize Veselago interference to localize uncollimated
electrons and characterize its contribution in further improving collimation efficiency. Our
work sheds new light on relativistic single-particle physics and provides important technical
improvements toward next-generation quantum devices based on the coherent manipulation of electron
momentum and trajectory.

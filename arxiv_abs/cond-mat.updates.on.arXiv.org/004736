Manipulating crystal structure and the corresponding electronic properties in topological quantum
materials provides opportunities for the exploration of exotic physics and practical applications.
As prototypical topological materials, the bulk MoTe2 and WTe2 are identified to be Weyl semimetals
and higher-order topological insulators. The non-centrosymmetric interlayer stacking in MoTe2
and WTe2 causes the Weyl semimetal phase while the intralayer Peierls distortion causes the higher-order
topological insulator phase. Here, by ultrafast electron diffraction and TDDFT-MD simulations,
we report the photoinduced concurrent intralayer and interlayer structural transitions in both
the low temperature Td and room temperature 1T' phase of MoTe2 and WTe2. The ultrafast reduction
of the intralayer Peierls distortion within 0.3 ps is demonstrated to be driven by Mo-Mo (W-W) bond
stretching and dissociation. Both the interlayer shear displacement and the suppression of the
intralayer Peierls distortion are identified to be caused by photon excitation, which is a different
mechanism compared to the THz field and optical field driven structural transitions reported previously.
The revealed intralayer and interlayer structural transitions, provide an ultrafast switch from
the rich topological nontrivial phases, such as the Weyl semimetal phase and (higher-order) topological
insulator phase, to trivial phase in bulk MoTe2 and WTe2 and most monolayer TMDCs. Our work elucidates
the pathway of the intralayer and interlayer structural transitions and the associated topological
switches in atomic and femtosecond spatiotemporal scale, and sheds light on new opportunities
for the ultrafast manipulation of topological and other exotic properties by photon excitation.

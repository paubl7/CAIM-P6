Efficient adsorption and segregation of Xe & Kr gases is of high importance in commercial as well
as nuclear industries. Systematic ab initio calculations reveal that transition metal (TM) decorated
boron doped graphene (BDG-TM) sheet can act as an efficient substrate for adsorptive capture of
Xe & Kr (adatoms). Substantial enhancement in the adsorption energy (E_ads) is obtained on BDG-TM
substrates and it varies as BDG-Cu > BDG-Ni > BDG-Fe > BDG-Zn. The improvement is approximately four
times of the pristine BDG and twice that of the conventional metallic substrates. Noteworthy, the
difference in E ads of Xe & Kr on BDG-Cu and BDG-Ni substrate is -216 and -202 meV which is highly promising
for selective adsorption of Xe over Kr, a crucial requirement in nuclear industry. The Badar charge
analysis and charge density difference maps envisage that, the TM decoration alters the charge
distribution at substrate-adatom interface, which in turn brings a considerable change in the
polarization of adatom, leads to significant improvement in the E_ads. The change in polarization
of adatoms is interlinked with charge transfer process and it has been gauged by computing their
effective charges upon adsorption; which follows the same sequence of E_ads and hence corroborated
each other. Later, the partial density of states analysis shows a splitting and strong hybridization
of Xe-p with TM-d orbitals near the Fermi level of Fe, Ni and Cu decorated systems, unveils a strong
adsorption. Further, the effect of clustering and dispersion of Cu atoms on E_ads are analyzed using
a first principle based genetic algorithm, which reveals that clustering of Cu atoms deteriorate
the E_ads of Xe & Kr. Thus for experimental realization, uniform dispersion of fine Cu particle over
BDG sheet is proposed as a substrate.

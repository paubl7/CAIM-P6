It is known that the classical $O(N)$ model in dimension $d > 3$ at its bulk critical point admits three
boundary universality classes: the ordinary, the extra-ordinary and the special. For the ordinary
transition the bulk and the boundary order simultaneously; the extra-ordinary fixed point corresponds
to the bulk transition occurring in the presence of an ordered boundary, while the special fixed
point corresponds to a boundary phase transition between the ordinary and the extra-ordinary classes.
While the ordinary fixed point survives in $d = 3$, it is less clear what happens to the extra-ordinary
and special fixed points when $d = 3$ and $N \ge 2$. Here we show that formally treating $N$ as a continuous
parameter, there exists a critical value $N_c > 2$ separating two distinct regimes. For $N < N_c$
the extra-ordinary fixed point survives in $d = 3$, albeit in a modified form: the long-range boundary
order is lost, instead, the order parameter correlation function decays as a power of $\log r$. In
particular, for $N=2$, starting in the surface phase with quasi-long-range order and approaching
the bulk phase transition, the stiffness of the surface order parameter diverges logarithmically.
For $N > N_c$ there is no fixed point with order parameter correlations decaying slower than power
law. In fact, there are two scenarios for the evolution of the phase diagram past $N = N_c$. In the first,
the special fixed point approaches the extra-ordinary fixed point as $N \to N_c^-$, annihilating
with it. In the second scenario, the extra-ordinary fixed point evolves into a fixed point with power-law
correlations of the order parameter for $N$ slightly above $N_c$ and only annihilates with the special
fixed point at a larger value of $N = N_{c2}$. The second scenario might explain recent numerical
results on boundary criticality in 2+1D quantum spin systems with $SO(3)$ symmetry.

Understanding physics of quantum emitters strongly interacting with quantized electromagnetic
continuum is one of the primary goals in the emergent field of waveguide quantum electrodynamics
(QED). When the light-matter coupling strength is comparable to or even exceeds energies of elementary
excitations, conventional approaches based on perturbative treatment of light-matter interactions,
two-level description of matter excitations, and photon-number truncation are no longer sufficient.
Here we study in and out of equilibrium properties of waveguide QED in such nonperturbative regimes
by developing a comprehensive and rigorous theoretical approach using an asymptotic decoupling
unitary transformation. In the transformed frame, factorization between light and matter becomes
exact in the strong-coupling limit and an accurate effective model can be derived for arbitrary
interaction strengths. We uncover several surprising features ranging from symmetry-protected
many-body bound states in the continuum to strong renormalization of the effective mass and potential;
the latter may explain recent experiments demonstrating cavity-induced changes in chemical reactivity
as well as enhancements of ferromagnetism or superconductivity. We demonstrate these results
by applying our general formalism to a model of coupled cavity arrays, which is relevant to experiments
in superconducting qubits interacting with microwave resonators or atoms coupled to photonic
crystals. We examine the relation between our results and delocalization-localization transition
in the spin-boson model; notably, we point out that one can find a quantum phase transition akin to
the superradiant transition in multi-emitter waveguide QED systems. Besides waveguide resonators,
we discuss possible applications of our framework to other systems relevant to quantum optics,
condensed matter physics, and quantum chemistry.

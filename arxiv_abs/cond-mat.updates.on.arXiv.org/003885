The quantum spin systems Cu$_2$M'BO$_5$ (M' = Al, Ga) with the ludwigite crystal structure consist
of a structurally ordered Cu$^{2+}$ sublattice in the form of three-leg ladders, interpenetrated
by a structurally disordered sublattice with a statistically random site occupation by magnetic
Cu$^{2+}$ and nonmagnetic Ga$^{3+}$ or Al$^{3+}$ ions. A microscopic analysis based on density-functional-theory
calculations for Cu$_2$GaBO$_5$ reveals a frustrated quasi-two-dimensional spin model featuring
five inequivalent antiferromagnetic exchanges. A broad low-temperature $^{11}$B nuclear magnetic
resonance points to a considerable spin disorder in the system. In zero magnetic field, antiferromagnetic
order sets in below $T_\text{N}$ $\approx$ 4.1 K and ~2.4 K for the Ga and Al compounds, respectively.
From neutron diffraction, we find that the magnetic propagation vector in Cu$_2$GaBO$_5$ is commensurate
and lies on the Brillouin-zone boundary in the (H0L) plane, $\mathbf{q}_\text{m}$ = (0.45 0 -0.7),
corresponding to a complex noncollinear long-range ordered structure with a large magnetic unit
cell. Muon spin relaxation is monotonic, consisting of a fast static component typical for complex
noncollinear spin systems and a slow dynamic component originating from the relaxation on low-energy
spin fluctuations. Gapless spin dynamics in the form of a diffuse quasielastic peak is also evidenced
by inelastic neutron scattering. Most remarkably, application of a magnetic field above 1 T destroys
the static long-range order, which is manifested in the gradual broadening of the magnetic Bragg
peaks. We argue that such a crossover from a magnetically long-range ordered state to a spin-glass
regime may result from orphan spins on the structurally disordered magnetic sublattice, which
are polarized in magnetic field and thus act as a tuning knob for field-controlled magnetic disorder.

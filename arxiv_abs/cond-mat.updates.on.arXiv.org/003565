Two-dimensional (2D) antimony (Sb, antimonene) recently attracted interest due to its peculiar
electronic properties and its suitability as anode material in next generation batteries. Sb however
exhibits a large polymorphic/allotropic structural diversity, which is also influenced by the
Sb's support. Thus understanding Sb heterostructure formation is key in 2D Sb integration. Particularly
2D Sb/graphene interfaces are of prime importance as contacts in electronics and electrodes in
batteries. We thus study here few-layered 2D Sb/graphene heterostructures by atomic-resolution
(scanning) transmission electron microscopy. We find the co-existence of two Sb morphologies:
First is a 2D growth morphology of layered beta-Sb with beta-Sb(001)||graphene(001) texture.
Second are one-dimensional (1D) Sb nanowires which can be matched to beta-Sb with beta-Sb[2-21]
perpendicular to graphene(001) texture and are structurally also closely related to thermodynamically
non-preferred cubic Sb(001)||graphene(001). Importantly, both Sb morphologies show rotational
van-der-Waals epitaxy with the graphene support. Both Sb morphologies are well resilient against
environmental bulk oxidation, although superficial Sb-oxide layer formation merits consideration,
including formation of novel epitaxial Sb2O3(111)/beta-Sb(001) heterostructures. Exact Sb
growth behavior is sensitive on employed processing and substrate properties including, notably,
the nature of the support underneath the direct graphene support. This introduces the substrate
underneath a direct 2D support as a key parameter in 2D Sb heterostructure formation. Our work provides
insights into the rich phase and epitaxy landscape in 2D Sb and 2D Sb/graphene heterostructures.

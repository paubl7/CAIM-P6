The recent discovery of guiding Dirac fermions in two-dimensional graphene by one-dimensional
electrostatic potential has paved the way for an electronic wave guide. However, identifying these
guided electronic modes using conventional probes like scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum
capacitance are quite challenging. In this work, we show that thermoelectric measurement using
one-dimensional nano heater is an excellent tool to probe the guided modes in graphene. The device
consists of InAs nanowire (NW) and graphene vertical hetero-structure, where they are electrically
isolated by a thin (~ 10nm) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). Contrary to conventional thermoelectric
measurements, where a heater is placed at one side, we have used the InAs NW (diameter ~ 50 nm) as a local
heater at the middle of the hetero-structure and measure the thermoelectric response across the
graphene as a function of temperature (1.5K - 50K) and carrier concentration. The thermoelectric
voltage across the bilayer graphene (BLG) in NW-BLG devices follows the trend of Seebeck coefficient
predicted by Mott's formula with a sign change around the Dirac point. In contrast, the thermoelectric
voltage measured across the monolayer graphene (MLG) in NW-MLG devices shows anomalous large amplitude
oscillations around the Dirac point, albeit not seen in the Mott's response obtained from the electrical
conductivity data on the same device. The anomalous oscillations are manifestation of confined
modes in MLG by the electrostatic potential of the NW, which is otherwise much weaker in the NW-BLG
devices. The calculated temperature profile of the hetero-structure shows that the gradient of
temperature is dominant around the graphene part underneath the NW, and thus sensitive to the confined
modes resulting in anomalous oscillations in the thermoelectric voltage.

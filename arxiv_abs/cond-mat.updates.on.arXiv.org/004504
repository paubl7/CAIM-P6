Reducible oxides are widely used catalyst supports that can increase oxidation reaction rates
by transferring their lattice oxygen at the metal-support interface. The interfacial oxidation
process is typically described in terms of a Mars-van Krevelen mechanism. However, many outstanding
questions remain unanswered regarding the atomic-scale structure and dynamic meta-stability
(i.e., fluxional behavior) of the interface $\textit{during catalysis}$. Here, we employ aberration-corrected
$\textit{operando}$ electron microscopy to visualize the structural dynamics occurring at and
near Pt/CeO$_{2}$ interfaces during CO oxidation. Finite element simulations are performed to
develop a reaction rate analysis wherein the atomic-level structural observations are directly
correlated with the catalyst's turnover frequency for CO oxidation. We show that the increasing
frequency of catalytic turnover correlates with dynamic fluxional behavior that (a) destablizes
the supported Pt particle, (b) marks an enhanced rate of oxygen vacancy creation and annihilation,
and (c) leads to increased strain and reduction in the surface of the CeO$_{2}$ support. Overall,
the results implicate the interfacial Pt-O-Ce bonds anchoring the Pt to the support as being involved
also in the catalytically-driven oxygen transfer process, and they suggest that oxygen reduction
takes place on the highly reduced nearby CeO2 surface before migrating to the interfacial perimeter
for reaction with CO. The $\textit{operando}$ electron microscopy approach described here should
be applicable to a large number of nanoparticle catalysts. This technique will enable the identification
of catalytically functional surface structures and strengthen our ability to establish (dynamic)
structure-activity relationships.

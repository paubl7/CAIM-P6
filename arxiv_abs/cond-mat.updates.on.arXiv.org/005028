Since the Efimov effect was introduced in 1970, a detailed theoretical understanding of Efimov
physics has been developed in the few-body context. However, it has proven to be challenging to describe
the role Efimov-type correlations play in many-body systems such as quenched or collapsing Bose-Einstein
condensates (BECs). To study the impact the Efimov effect can have in such scenarios, we consider
a light impurity immersed in a weakly interacting BEC, forming a Bose polaron. In this case, the higher-order
correlations are localized around the impurity, making it more feasible to develop a theoretical
description. Specifically, we employ a Gaussian state variational Ansatz in the reference frame
of the impurity, capable of both capturing the Efimov effect and the formation of the polaron cloud.
We find that the Efimov effect leads to a cooperative binding of bosons to the impurity and the formation
of a many-body bound state. As a result, the polaron is not the ground state, but rendered a metastable
excited state which can decay into these Efimov clusters. While this decay is slow for small interaction
strengths, it becomes more prominent as the attractive scattering length increases, up to the point
where the polaron becomes completely unstable. This critical scattering length can be interpreted
as a many-body shifted Efimov resonance, where the scattering of two excitations of the bath with
the polaron can lead to bound state formation. Compared to the few-body case, the resonance is shifted
to smaller attractive scattering lengths due to the participation of the polaron cloud in the cooperative
binding process. This corresponds to an intriguing scenario of polaron-assisted chemistry, where
many-body effects lead to enhanced signal of the chemical recombination process, which can be directly
probed in state-of-the-art experiments.

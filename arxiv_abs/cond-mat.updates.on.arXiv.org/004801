Optically and magnetically active point defects in semiconductors are interesting platforms
for the development of solid-state quantum technologies. Their optical properties are usually
probed by measuring photoluminescence spectra, which provide information on excitation energies
and on the interaction of electrons with lattice vibrations. We present a combined computational
and experimental study of photoluminescence spectra of defects in diamond and SiC, aimed at assessing
the validity of theoretical and numerical approximations used in first principles calculations,
including the use of the Franck-Condon principle and the displaced harmonic oscillator approximation.
We focus on prototypical examples of solid-state qubits, the divacancy centers in SiC and the nitrogen-vacancy
in diamond, and we report computed photoluminescence spectra as a function of temperature that
are in very good agreement with the measured ones. As expected we find that the use of hybrid functionals
leads to more accurate results than semilocal functionals. Interestingly our calculations show
that constrained density functional theory (CDFT) and time-dependent hybrid DFT perform equally
well in describing the excited state potential energy surface of triplet states; our findings indicate
that CDFT, a relatively cheap computational approach, is sufficiently accurate for the calculations
of photoluminescence spectra of the defects studied here. Finally, we find that only by correcting
for finite-size effects and extrapolating to the dilute limit, one can obtain a good agreement between
theory and experiment. Our results provide a detailed validation protocol of first principles
calculations of photoluminescence spectra, necessary both for the interpretation of experiments
and for robust predictions of the electronic properties of point defects in semiconductors.

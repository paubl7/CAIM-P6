Superelastic shape-memory alloys (SMAs) are unique smart materials with a considerable energy
dissipation potential for dynamic loadings with varying strain-rates. The energy dissipation
depends on the latent heat generated by the austenitic-martensitic transformation and the convection
of that heat. Due to the thermomechanical coupling, the martensitic nucleation stress level and
thus the propagation of martensitic phase fronts strongly depends on the material temperature.
High strain-rate interferes with the release of the latent heat to the environment and determines
quantity, position and propagation of martensitic transformation bands. Lastly, high strain-rate
reduces the hysteresis surface. The propagation velocity and quantity of martensitic bands have
an impact on martensitic phase stability. The degree of atomic disorder and accordingly the change
in entropy influences the reverse phase transformation from martensite to austenite. In other
words, the stability of the martensitic state affects the stress level of the reverse transformation.
However, in phenomenological superelastic SMA models, which are used to simulate energy dissipation
behavior, the effects of the rate-dependent entropy change are not considered in particular. To
incorporate the rate-dependent entropy change, we improved a one-dimensional numerical model
by introducing an additional control variable in the free energy formulation for solid-solid phase
transformation of superelastic SMAs. In this model, the observed effects of the strain-rate on
the reverse transformation are taken into account by calculating the rate-dependent entropy change.
A comparison of the numerical results with the experimental data shows that the model calculates
the dynamic superelastic hysteresis of SMAs more accurately.

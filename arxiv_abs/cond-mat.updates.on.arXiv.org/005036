We study mean-field states resulting from the pairing of electrons in time-reversal broken fractal
Hofstadter bands, which arise in two-dimensional lattices where the unit cell traps magnetic flux
$\Phi = (p/q)\Phi_0$ comparable to the flux quantum $\Phi_0 = h/e$. It is established that the dimension
and degeneracy of the irreducible representations of the magnetic translation group (MTG) furnished
by the charge 2e pairing fields have different properties from those furnished by single particle
Bloch states, and in particular are shown to depend on the parity of the denominator $q$. We explore
this symmetry analysis to formulate a Ginzburg-Landau theory describing the thermodynamic properties
of Hofstadter superconductors at arbitrary rational flux $\Phi = (p/q)\Phi_0$ in terms of a multicomponent
order parameter that describes the finite momentum pairing of electrons across different Fermi
surface patches. This phenomenological theory leads to a rich phase diagram characterized by different
symmetry breaking patterns of the MTG, which can be interpreted as distinct classes of vortex lattices.
A class of $\mathbb{Z}_q$-symmetric Hofstadter SCs is identified, in which the MTG breaks down
to a $\mathbb{Z}_q$ subgroup. We study the topological properties of such $\mathbb{Z}_q$-symmetric
Hofstadter SCs and show that the parity of the Chern numbers is fixed by the parity of $q$. We identify
the conditions for the realization of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in the presence of parity and MTG
symmetries, establishing a novel topological invariant capturing the existence of such charge-neutral
gapless excitations. Our findings, which could bear relevance to the description of re-entrant
superconductivity in moir\'e systems in the Hofstadter regime, establish Hofstadter SC as a fertile
setting to explore symmetry broken and topological orders.

We present a non perturbative and formally exact approach for charge transport in interacting nanojunctions
based on a real time path integral formulation of the reduced system dynamics. An expansion of the
influence functional in terms of the number of tunneling transitions, and integration of the Grassmann
variables between the tunneling times, allows us to obtain a still exact generalized master equation
(GME) for the populations of the reduced density matrix (RDM) in the occupation number representation,
as well as a formally exact expression for the current. By borrowing the nomenclature of the famous
spin-boson problem, we characterize the two-state dynamics of such degrees of freedom on the forward
and backward branches in terms of single four-state paths with alternating blips and sojourns.
This allows a diagrammatic representation of the GME kernel and its parametrization in terms of
sequences of blips and sojourns. We apply our formalism to the exactly solvable resonant level model
(RLM) and to the the single impurity Anderson model (SIAM), the latter being a prototype system for
studying strong correlations. For both systems, we demonstrate a hierarchical diagrammatic structure
of the exact GME kernel. While the hierarchy closes at the second-tier level for the RLM, this is not
the case for the interacting SIAM. Upon inspection of the GME, known results from various perturbative
and nonperturbative approximation schemes to quantum transport in the SIAM are recovered. Finally,
a noncrossing approximation for the hierarchical kernel is developed, which enables us to systematically
decrease temperature at each next level of the approximation. Analytical results for a simplified
fourth-tier scheme are presented.

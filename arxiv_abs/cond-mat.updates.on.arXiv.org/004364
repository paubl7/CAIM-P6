Many promising optoelectronic devices, such as broadband photodetectors, nonlinear frequency
converters, and building blocks for data communication systems, exploit photoexcited charge
carriers in graphene. For these systems, it is essential to understand, and eventually control,
the cooling dynamics of the photoinduced hot-carrier distribution. There is, however, still an
active debate on the different mechanisms that contribute to hot-carrier cooling. In particular,
the intrinsic cooling mechanism that ultimately limits the cooling dynamics remains an open question.
Here, we address this question by studying two technologically relevant systems, consisting of
high-quality graphene with a mobility >10,000 cm$^2$V$^{-1}$s$^{-1}$ and environments that
do not efficiently take up electronic heat from graphene: WSe$_2$-encapsulated graphene and suspended
graphene. We study the cooling dynamics of these two high-quality graphene systems using ultrafast
pump-probe spectroscopy at room temperature. Cooling via disorder-assisted acoustic phonon
scattering and out-of-plane heat transfer to the environment is relatively inefficient in these
systems, predicting a cooling time of tens of picoseconds. However, we observe much faster cooling,
on a timescale of a few picoseconds. We attribute this to an intrinsic cooling mechanism, where carriers
in the hot-carrier distribution with enough kinetic energy emit optical phonons. During phonon
emission, the electronic system continuously re-thermalizes, re-creating carriers with enough
energy to emit optical phonons. We develop an analytical model that explains the observed dynamics,
where cooling is eventually limited by optical-to-acoustic phonon coupling. These fundamental
insights into the intrinsic cooling mechanism of hot carriers in graphene will play a key role in
guiding the development of graphene-based optoelectronic devices.

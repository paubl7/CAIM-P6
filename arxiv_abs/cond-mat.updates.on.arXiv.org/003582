In this article, a detailed study of the recently synthesized MAX phase borides M2SB (M = Zr, Hf and
Nb) has been performed via first principles technique. Investigation of mechanical hardness,
elastic anisotropy, optical properties, dynamical stability and thermal properties are considered
for the first time. The estimated values of stiffness constants and elastic moduli are found in good
agreement with available results. The micro and macro hardness (Hmicro and Hmacro) parameters
are calculated. The Vickers hardness is also calculated using Mulliken population analysis. The
electronic density of states and charge density mapping are used to explain the variation of stiffness
constants, elastic moduli and hardness parameters among the studied ternary borides. The Nb2SB
compound is found to show best combination of mechanical properties. Mixture of covalent and ionic
bonding within these borides is explained using Mulliken population analysis. The direction dependent
values of Youngs modulus, compressibility, shear modulus and Poissons ratio are visualized by
2D and 3D representations and different anisotropic factors are calculated. The important optical
constants are calculated and analyzed. The metallic nature of the studied borides is confirmed
from the DOS and optical properties. The reflectivity spectra reveal the potential use of Zr2SB
as coating materials to diminish solar heating. The studied borides are dynamically stable as confirmed
from the phonon dispersion curves. The characteristic thermodynamic properties have also been
calculated and analyzed. The physical properties of corresponding 211 MAX phase carbides are also
calculated for comparison with those of the titled ternary borides.

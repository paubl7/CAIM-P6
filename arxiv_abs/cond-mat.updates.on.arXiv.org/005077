Euclidean Q-ball type solutions carrying Cooper/local-pair condensates inside finite volume
with classically oscillating in Matsubara time spin-/charge densities (SDW/CDW) are found in
the 'nested' repulsive Hubbard model of high-T$_c$ superconductors. An exchange between fermions
with coherently oscillating SDW/CDW inside the Q-balls provides `pairing glue', that couples
fermions into Cooper/local-pairs. Euclidean Q-ball solutions arise below some temperature $T^{*}$
due to global invariance of the effective theory under the phase rotation of the SDW/CDW fluctuations
amplitudes, that conserves a 'Noether charge' Q along the Matsubara time axis. At $T^{*}$ the classical
SDW/CDW fluctuations arise via 1$^{st}$ order phase transition, while superconducting condensate
density inside Q-balls is zero at $T^{*}$ and possesses a steep maximum at $T<T^{*}$, causing a similar
maximum in specific heat of the Q-balls 'gas'. Below $T^{*}$ the volume of the Q-balls is inversely
proportional to the square of SDW/CDW fluctuation amplitude. The fermionic spectral gap inside
Euclidean Q-balls arises in the vicinity of the 'nested' regions of the bare Fermi surface and scales
with the square root of the superconducting density. All the described solutions are found analytically
from the Eliashberg like equations for the two cases of 'nesting' wave vectors: a CDW wave vector
$Q_{CDW}$, connecting regions near the Fermi surface with equal signs of the superconducting order
parameter, or for a SDW wave vector $Q_{SDW}$, connecting regions with the opposite signs of the
$d$-wave superconducting order parameter. Possible relation of the presented theory with thermodynamic
time-crystals and different properties of superconductors is discussed.

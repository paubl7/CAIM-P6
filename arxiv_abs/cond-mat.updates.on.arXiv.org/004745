van der Waals heterostructures assembled from atomically thin crystals are ideal model systems
to study spin-orbital coupled transport because they exhibit a strong interplay between spin,
lattice and valley degrees of freedom that can be manipulated by strain, electric bias and proximity
effects. The recently predicted spin-helical regime in graphene on transition metal dichalcogenides,
in which spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom are locked together [M. Offidani et al. Phys. Rev.
Lett. 119, 196801 (2017)], suggests their potential application in spintronics. Here, by deriving
an Eilenberger equation for the quasiclassical Green's function of two-dimensional Dirac fermions
in the presence of} spin-orbit coupling\textcolor{black}{{} (SOC) and scalar disorder, we obtain
analytical expressions for the dc spin galvanic susceptibility and spin Hall conductivity in the
spin-helical regime. Our results disclose a sign change in the spin Hall angle (SHA) when the Fermi
energy relative to the Dirac point matches the Bychkov-Rashba energy scale, irrespective of the
magnitude of the spin-valley interaction imprinted on the graphene layer. The behavior of the SHA
is connected to a reversal of the total internal angular momentum of Bloch electrons that reflects
the spin-pseudospin entanglement induced by SOC. We also show that the charge-spin conversion
reaches a maximum when the Fermi level lies at the edge of the spin-minority band in agreement with
previous findings. Both features are fingerprints of spin-helical Dirac fermions and suggest
a direct way to estimate the strength of proximity-induced SOC from transport data. The relevance
of these findings for interpreting recent spin-charge conversion measurements in nonlocal spin-valve
geometry is also discussed.

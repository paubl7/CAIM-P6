Photoconductors based on semiconducting thin films, nanowires and 2-dimensional atomic layers
have been extensively investigated. But there is no explicit photogain equation that allows for
fitting and designing photoresponses of these devices. In this work, we managed to derive explicit
photogain equations for silicon nanowire photoconductors based on experimental observations.
The silicon nanowires were fabricated by patterning the device layer of silicon-on-insulator
wafers by standard lithography that were doped with boron. It was found that the as-fabricated silicon
nanowires have a surface depletion region ~ 32 nm wide. This depletion region protects charge carriers
in the channel from surface scatterings, resulting in the independence of charge carrier mobilities
on nanowire size. It is consistent with our Hall effect measurements but in contradiction with the
accepted conclusion in the past decades that charge carrier mobilities become smaller for smaller
nanowires due to surface scatterings. Under light illumination, the depletion region logarithmically
narrows down and the nanowire channel widens accordingly. Photo Hall effect measurements show
that the nanowire photoconductance is not contributed by the increase of carrier concentrations
but the widening of the nanowire channel. As a result, a nanowire photoconductor can be modeled as
a resistor in connection with floating Schottky junctions near the nanowire surfaces. Based on
the photoresponses of a Schottky junction, we derived explicit photogain equations for nanowire
photoconductors that are a function of light intensity and device physical parameters. The gain
equations fit well with the experimental data, from which we extracted the minority carrier lifetimes
that are consistent with the minority carrier lifetime in nanowires reported in literature.

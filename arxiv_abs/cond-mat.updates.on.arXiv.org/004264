Point defects in crystalline materials often occur in multiple charge states. Although many experimental
methods to study and explore point defects are available, techniques to explore the non-equilibrium
dynamics of the charge states of these defects at ultrafast (sub-nanosecond) time scales have not
been discussed before. We present results from ultrafast optical-pump supercontinuum-probe
spectroscopy measurements on $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. The study of point defects in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$
is essential for its establishment as a material platform for high-power electronics and deep-UV
optoelectronics. Use of a supercontinuum probe allows us to obtain the time-resolved absorption
spectra of material defects under non-equilibrium conditions with picosecond time resolution.
The probe absorption spectra shows defect absorption peaks at two energies, $\sim$2.2 eV and $\sim$1.63
eV, within the 1.3-2.5 eV probe energy bandwidth. The strength of the absorption associated with
each peak is time-dependent and the spectral weight shifts from the lower energy peak to the higher
energy peak with pump-probe delay. Further, maximum defect absorption is seen for probe polarized
along the crystal c-axis. The time-dependent probe absorption spectra and the observed dynamics
for all probe wavelengths at all pump-probe delays can be fit with a set of rate equations for a single
multi-level defect. Based on first-principles calculations within hybrid density functional
theory we attribute the observed absorption features to optical transitions from the valence band
to different charge states of Gallium vacancies. Our results demonstrate that broadband ultrafast
supercontinuum spectroscopy can be a useful tool to explore charge states of defects and defect
dynamics in semiconductors.

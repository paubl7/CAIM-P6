On the basis of an exact perturbational expression for the interacting one-particle Green function
$G$ corresponding to bosons / fermions in terms of the bare interaction potential $v$ and permanents
/ determinants of the non-interacting one-particle Green function $G_0$, we deduce four recursive
perturbation expansions for the self-energy $\Sigma$. With $W$ denoting the dynamic screened
interaction potential, these perturbation expansions are identical to those of $\Sigma$ in terms
of (i) self-energy diagrams and $(v, G_0)$, (ii) $G$-skeleton self-energy diagrams and $(v, G)$,
(iii) $W$-skeleton self-energy diagrams and $(W, G_0)$, and (iv) $G$- and $W$-skeleton self-energy
diagrams and $(W,G)$. For the calculation of $W$, we rely on a similar exact perturbational expression
for the interacting two-particle Green function $G_2$ as for $G$. From this expression, we deduce
four recursive perturbation expansions for the polarization function $P$, necessary for the calculation
of $W$, that are similar to those for $\Sigma$ specified above. The correlation functions considered
in this paper may be corresponding to ground states, and thermal ensemble of states. For thermal
ensemble of states, we consider both the imaginary-time formalism of Matsubara, and the real-time
formalism of thermo-field dynamics (TFD). The latter is advantageous for the direct calculation
of dynamic correlation functions. In an appendix, we apply the formalisms presented in this paper
to the Hubbard Hamiltonian for spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ fermions on a lattice in arbitrary $d$ spatial
dimensions. In two further appendices, we present methods and short programs for determining the
$\nu$th-order diagrams corresponding to the perturbation expansions of $G$ in terms of $(v,G_0)$,
and $\Sigma$ in terms of $(v,G_0)$ and $(v,G)$ on the basis of the cycle decompositions of the elements
of the symmetric group $S_{2\nu}$.

Low-dimensional descriptions of spiking neural network dynamics are an effective tool for bridging
different scales of organization of brain structure and function. Recent advances in deriving
mean-field descriptions for networks of coupled oscillators have sparked the development of a
new generation of neural mass models. Of notable interest are mean-field descriptions of all-to-all
coupled quadratic integrate-and-fire (QIF) neurons, which have already seen numerous extensions
and applications. These extensions include different forms of short-term adaptation (STA) considered
to play an important role in generating and sustaining dynamic regimes of interest in the brain.
It is an open question, however, whether the incorporation of pre-synaptic forms of synaptic plasticity
driven by single neuron activity would still permit the derivation of mean-field equations using
the same method. Here, we discuss this problem using an established model of short-term synaptic
plasticity at the single neuron level, for which we present two different approaches for the derivation
of the mean-field equations. We compare these models with a recently proposed mean-field approximation
that assumes stochastic spike timings. In general, the latter fails to accurately reproduce the
macroscopic activity in networks of deterministic QIF neurons with distributed parameters. We
show that the mean-field models we propose provide a more accurate description of the network dynamics,
although they are mathematically more involved. Thus, we provide novel insight into the macroscopic
effects of short-term synaptic plasticity in spiking neural networks, as well as two different
mean-field descriptions for future investigations of such networks.

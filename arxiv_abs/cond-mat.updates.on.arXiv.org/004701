One of the most promising routes for achieving unprecedentedly high critical currents in superconductors
is to incorporate dispersed, non-superconducting nanoparticles to control the dissipative motion
of vortices. However, these inclusions reduce the overall superconducting volume and can strain
the interlaying superconducting matrix, which can detrimentally reduce $T_c$. Consequently,
an optimal balance must be achieved between the nanoparticle density $n_p$ and size $d$. Determining
this balance requires garnering a better understanding of vortex-nanoparticle interactions,
described by strong pinning theory. Here, we map the dependence of the critical current on nanoparticle
size and density in (Y$_{0.77}$,Gd$_{0.23}$)Ba$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ films in magnetic
fields up to 35 T, and compare the trends to recent results from time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau
simulations. We identify consistencies between the field-dependent critical current $J_c(B)$
and expectations from strong pinning theory. Specifically, we find that that $J_c \propto B^{-\alpha}$,
where $\alpha$ decreases from $0.66$ to $0.2$ with increasing density of nanoparticles and increases
roughly linearly with nanoparticle size $d/\xi$ (normalized to the coherence length). At high
fields, the critical current decays faster ($\sim B^{-1}$), suggestive that each nanoparticle
has captured a vortex. When nanoparticles capture more than one vortex, a small, high-field peak
is expected in $J_c(B)$. Due to a spread in defect sizes, this novel peak effect remains unresolved
here. Lastly, we reveal that the dependence of the vortex creep rate $S$ on nanoparticle size and
density roughly mirrors that of $\alpha$, and compare our results to low-$T$ nonlinearities in
$S(T)$ that are predicted by strong pinning theory.

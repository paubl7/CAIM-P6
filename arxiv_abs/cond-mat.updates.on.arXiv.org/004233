Motivated from the central role of the mean-square displacement and its second time-derivative
-- that is the velocity autocorrelation function $\left\langle v(0)v(t)\right\rangle=\frac{1}{2}
\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 \left\langle \Delta r^2 (t)\right\rangle}{\mathrm{d}t^2} $ in the description
of Brownian motion, this paper examines what is the physical meaning of the first time-derivative
of the mean-square displacement of Brownian particles. By employing a rheological analogue for
Brownian motion, we show that the time-derivative of the mean-square displacement $\frac{\mathrm{d}\left\langle
\Delta r^{2} (t) \right\rangle}{\mathrm{d}t}$ of Brownian microspheres with mass $m$ and radius
$R$ immersed in any linear, isotropic viscoelastic material is identical to $\frac{N K_B T}{3 \pi
R}h(t)$, where $h(t)$ is the impulse response function $($strain history $\gamma (t)$, due to an
impulse stress $\tau (t)=\delta (t-0))$ of a rheological network that is parallel connection of
the linear viscoelastic material with an inerter with distributed inertance $m_R=\frac{m}{6
\pi R}$. With the introduction of the impulse response fucntion $h(t)$, we show that there is a direct
analogy between the description of the deterministic motion of a free particle with its displacement
$r(t)$, velocity $v(t)$ and acceleration $a(t)$; and the description of the random, thermally
driven, Brownian motion of a collection of particles with the associated deterministic creep compliance
$J(t)=\frac{3\pi R}{N K_B T}\left\langle \Delta r^2 (t) \right\rangle$, impulse response function
$h(t)$, and impulse strain-rate response function $\psi(t)=\frac{6\pi R}{N K_B T}\left\langle
v(0)v(t)\right\rangle$, of the viscoelastic material-inerter parallel connection.

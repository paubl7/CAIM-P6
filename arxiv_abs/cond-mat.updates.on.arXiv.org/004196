A Brownian dynamics algorithm is used to describe the static behaviour of associative polymer solutions.
Predictions for the fractions of stickers bound by intra-chain and inter-chain association, as
a function of system parameters such as the number of stickers on a chain, the number of backbone monomers
between stickers, the solvent quality, and monomer concentration are obtained. A systematic comparison
with the scaling relations predicted by the mean-field theory of Dobrynin (Macromolecules, 37,
3881, 2004) is carried out. Different regimes of scaling behaviour are identified by the theory
depending on the monomer concentration, the density of stickers on a chain, and the solvent quality
for backbone monomers. Simulation results validate the predictions of the mean-field theory across
a wide range of parameter values in all the scaling regimes. The value of the des Cloizeaux exponent,
$\theta_2 = 1/3$, proposed by Dobrynin for sticky polymer solutions, is shown to lead to a collapse
of simulation data for all the scaling relations considered here. Three different signatures for
the characterisation of gelation are identified, with each leading to a different value of the concentration
at the sol-gel transition. The modified Flory-Stockmayer expression is found to be validated by
simulations for all three gelation signatures. The modified expression, proposed by Dobrynin,
accounts for the presence of intra-chain associations. Simulation results confirm the prediction
of scaling theory for the gelation line that separates sol and gel phases, when the modified Flory-Stockmayer
expression is used. Phase separation is found to occur with increasing concentration for systems
in which the backbone monomers are under $\theta$-solvent conditions, and is shown to coincide
with a breakdown in the predictions of scaling theory.

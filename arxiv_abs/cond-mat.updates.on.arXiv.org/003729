Endeavoring toward a transferable, predictive coarse-grained explicit-chain model for biomolecular
condensates underlain by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS), we conducted multiple-chain
simulations of the N-terminal intrinsically disordered region (IDR) of DEAD-box helicase Ddx4,
as a test case, to assess the roles of electrostatic, hydrophobic, cation-$\pi$, and aromatic interactions
in amino acid sequence-dependent LLPS. We evaluated 3 residue-residue interaction schemes with
a shared electrostatic potential. Neither a common hydrophobicity scheme nor one augmented with
arginine/lysine-aromatic cation-$\pi$ interactions consistently accounted for the experimental
LLPS data on the wildtype, a charge-scrambled, an FtoA, and an RtoK mutant of Ddx4 IDR. In contrast,
interactions based on contact statistics among folded globular protein structures reproduce
the overall experimental trend, including that the RtoK mutant has a much diminished LLPS propensity.
Consistency between simulation and LLPS experiment was also found for RtoK mutants of P-granule
protein LAF-1, underscoring that, to a degree, the important LLPS-driving $\pi$-related interactions
are embodied in classical statistical potentials. Further elucidation will be necessary, however,
especially of phenylalanine's role in condensate assembly because experiments on FtoA and YtoF
mutants suggest that LLPS-driving phenylalanine interactions are significantly weaker than
those posited by common statistical potentials. Protein-protein electrostatic interactions
are modulated by relative permittivity, which depends on protein concentration. Analytical theory
suggests that this dependence entails enhanced inter-protein interactions in the condensed phase
but more favorable protein-solvent interactions in the dilute phase. The opposing trends lead
to a modest overall impact on LLPS.

We clarify universal critical properties of delocalization-localization transitions in three-dimensional
(3D) unitary and orthogonal classes with particle-hole and/or chiral symmetries (classes AIII,
BDI, D, C and CI). We first introduce tight-binding models on cubic lattice that belong to these five
nonstandard symmetry classes respectively. Unlike the Bogoliubov-de Gennes Hamiltonian for
superconductors, all the five models have finite areas of Fermi surfaces in the momentum space in
the clean limit. Thereby, the scaling theory of the Anderson transition guarantees the presence
of the delocalization-localization transitions at finite disorder strength in these models.
Based on this expectation, we carry out extensive transfer matrix calculations of the Lyapunov
exponents for zero-energy eigenstates of the disordered tight-binding models with quasi-one-dimensional
geometry. Near the Anderson transition point, the correlation length diverges with a universal
critical exponent $\nu$. Using finite-size scaling analysis of the localization length, we determine
the critical exponent of the transitions and scaling function of the (normalized) localization
length in the three non-standard unitary symmetry classes: $\nu_{\text{AIII}}=1.06\pm0.02$,
$\nu_{\text{D}}=0.87\pm0.03$, and $\nu_{\text{C}}=0.996\pm0.012$. Our result of the class
C is consistent with a previous study of classical network model [M. Ortu\~no et al, Phys. Rev. Lett.
102, 070603 (2009)]. The critical exponents of the two non-standard orthogonal classes are estimated
as $\nu_{\text{CI}}=1.17 \pm 0.02$ and $\nu_{\text{BDI}}=1.12 \pm 0.06$. Our result of the class
CI is consistent with another previous study of a lattice model, while the exponent of the class BDI
is at variance with the previous evaluation of nodal Dirac ring model [X. L. Luo et al, Phys. Rev. B.

For electron spin qubits in quantum dots, reducing charge noise sensitivity is a critical step in
achieving fault tolerant two-qubit gates mediated by the exchange interaction. This work explores
how the physical device geometry affects the sensitivity of exchange to fluctuations in applied
gate voltage and interdot bias due to charge noise. We present a modified linear combination of harmonic
orbitals configuration interaction (LCHO-CI) method for calculating exchange energies that
is applicable to general quantum dot networks. In the modified LCHO-CI approach, an orthogonal
set of harmonic orbitals formed at the center of the dot network is used to approximate the many-electron
states. This choice of basis significantly reduces the computation time of the full CI calculation
by enabling a pre-calculated library of matrix elements to be used in evaluating the Coulomb integrals.
The resultant many-electron spectra are mapped onto a Heisenberg Hamiltonian to determine the
individual pairwise electronic exchange interaction strengths, $J_{ij}$. The accuracy of the
modified LCHO-CI method is further improved by optimizing the choice of harmonic orbitals without
significantly lengthening the calculation time. The modified LCHO-CI method is used to calculate
$J$ for a silicon MOSFET double quantum dot occupied by two electrons. Two-dimensional potential
landscapes are calculated from a 3D device structure, including both the Si/SiO$_2$ heterostructure
and metal gate electrodes. The computational efficiency of the modified LCHO-CI method enables
systematic tuning of the device parameters to determine their impact on the sensitivity of $J$ to
charge noise, including plunger gate size, tunnel gate width, SiO$_2$ thickness and dot eccentricity.
Generally, we find that geometries with larger dot charging energies, smaller plunger gate lever
arms, and symmetric dots are less sensitive to noise.

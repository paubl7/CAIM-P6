Significant leaps in the understanding of quantum systems have been driven by the exploration of
geometry, topology, dimensionality, and interactions with ultracold atomic ensembles. A system
where atoms evolve while confined on an ellipsoidal surface represents a heretofore unexplored
geometry and topology. Realizing such an ultracold bubble system (potentially Bose-Einstein
condensed) has areas of interest including quantized-vortex flow respecting topological constraints
imposed by closed surfaces, new collective modes, and self-interference via free bubble expansion.
Large ultracold bubbles, created by inflating smaller condensates, directly tie into Hubble-analog
expansion physics. Here, we report observations from the NASA Cold Atom Lab facility aboard the
International Space Station of bubbles of ultracold atoms created using a radiofrequency-dressing
protocol. We observe a variety of bubble configurations of differing sizes and initial temperature,
and explore bubble thermodynamics, demonstrating significant cooling associated with inflation.
Additionally, we achieve partial coverings of bubble traps greater than 1 mm in size with ultracold
films of inferred few-$\mu$m thickness, and we observe the dynamics of shell structures projected
into free-evolving harmonic confinement. The observations are part of the first generation of
scientific measurements made with ultracold atoms in space, exploiting the benefits of perpetual
free-fall to explore gravity-free evolution of quantum systems that are prohibitively difficult
to create on Earth. This work points the way to experiments focused on the nature of the Bose-Einstein
condensed bubble, the character of its excitations, and the role of topology in its evolution; it
also ushers in an era of orbital microgravity quantum-gas physics.

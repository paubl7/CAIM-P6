Time-reversal (T) symmetry breaking is a fundamental physics concept underpinning a broad science
and technology area, including topological magnets, axion physics, dissipationless Hall currents,
or spintronic memories. A central role in the field has been played by ferromagnets with spontaneously
Zeeman-split bands and corresponding macroscopic T-symmetry breaking phenomena observable
in the absence of an external magnetic field. In contrast, the Neel antiferromagnetism with anti-parallel
atomic moments was not considered to generate the Zeeman splitting, leaving this abundant materials
family outside of the focus of research of macroscopic T-symmetry breaking. Here, we discover a
T-symmetry breaking mechanism in a compensated collinear antiferromagnet Mn5Si3, with a Zeeman
splitting in the momentum space whose sign alternates across the electronic band structure. We
identify the antiferromagnetic Zeeman effect using ab initio electronic structure calculations
and from an analysis of spin-symmetries which were previously omitted in relativistic physics
classifications of spin-splittings and topological quasiparticles. To experimentally demonstrate
the macroscopic T-symmetry breaking in a Zeeman-split antiferromagnet, we measure the spontaneous
Hall effect in Mn5Si3 epilayers exhibiting a negligible net magnetic moment. The experimental
Hall conductivities are consistent with our ab initio calculations of the intrinsic disorder-independent
contribution, proportional to the topological Berry curvature. Our study of the multi-sublattice
antiferromagnet Mn5Si3 illustrates that a robust macroscopic T-symmetry breaking from the antiferromagnetic
Zeeman effect is compatible with a unique set of material properties, including low atomic numbers,
collinear magnetism with weak spin-decoherence, and vanishing net magnetization.

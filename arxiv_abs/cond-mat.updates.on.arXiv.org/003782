Two-dimensional quantum antiferromagnets host rich physics including long-range ordering,
high-Tc superconductivity, quantum spin liquid behavior, topological ordering, variety of other
exotic phases, and quantum criticalities. Frustrating perturbations in antiferromagnets may
give rise to strong quantum fluctuations, challenging the theoretical understanding of the many-body
ground state. Here we develop a method to describe the quantum antiferromagnets using fermionic
degrees of freedom. The method is based on a formally exact mapping between spin-exchange models
and theories describing fermionic matter with the emergent U(1) Chern-Simons gauge field. For
the planar Neel state, this mapping self-consistently generates the Chern-Simons superconductor
mean-field ground state of introduced fermions. We systematically compare the Chern-Simons superconductor
state with the planar Neel state at the level of collective modes and order parameters. We reveal
qualitative and quantitative correspondences between these states. Such a description of the
Neel order, constructed from the fractionalized fermion excitations and emergent gauge fields,
can be applied to the quantum spin-liquids. More importantly, it allows us to keep track of the unconventional
phase transitions from ordered states to the spin-liquids. We show that such confinement-deconfinement
transitions are signaled and characterized by the Chern-Simons superconductor instabilities,
driven by strong frustration. These results provide a systematic parton mean-field approach that
accounts for the magnetically ordered state, the spin-liquids, and the unconventional phase transitions
in a unified physical picture. The findings suggest observing and classifying descendant states,
including quantum spin-liquids and unconventional superconductors.

The coalescence of tiny particles into a larger particle is valuable. A tiny-shaped particle becomes
a building block of the larger particle. On dissociation, atoms gather in the monolayer shape at
the solution surface. Assembling of building blocks nucleates a mono layer shape. The nucleated
mono layer shape extends adjacently on adhering structures of smooth elements in the later coalesced
tiny-shaped particles. Thus while processing different colloidal solutions, the study of mono
layer shape is vital. At an electronically flat solution surface, atoms of monolayer assembly undertake
the transition states. Such atoms bind in the shape of supplied nanoenergy packets. When nanoenergy
packets are related to the tuned bipolar pulses, blocks of connected triangle-shaped tiny particles
get developed. Upon leaving the electronically flat solution surface, a block of connected tiny-shaped
particles separates into two equal tiny-shaped particles. On exerting forces, an elongating atom
adheres to the lower-sided positioned elongating atom. In this way, atoms of array convert into
the structures of smooth elements. At the air-solution interface, the forcing energy of travelling
photons flatten the structures of smooth elements. Tiny-shaped particles coming from different
regions of the solution surface develop a mono layer shape in the region of concave meniscus. Upon
assembling and adhering adjacent-wise structures of smooth elements, the mono layer shape related
to geometric particle develops. A force of gravity becomes greater than force of levity in upper
shaped mono layer and a force of levity becomes greater than force of gravity in underneath shaped
mono layer. Process of adhering lateral-wise two mono layer shapes completes only in a few microseconds.
Monolayer and mono layer have different use in this study. Study also targets the featured devices.

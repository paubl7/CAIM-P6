Weakly coupled ferroelectric/dielectric superlattice thin film heterostructures exhibit complex
nanoscale polarization configurations that arise from a balance of competing electrostatic,
elastic, and domain-wall contributions to the free energy. A key feature of these configurations
is that the polarization can locally have a significant component that is not along the thin-film
surface normal direction, while maintaining zero net in-plane polarization. PbTiO3/SrTiO3 thin-film
superlattice heterostructures on a conducting SrRuO3 bottom electrode on SrTiO3 have a room-temperature
stripe nanodomain pattern with nanometer-scale lateral period. Ultrafast time-resolved x-ray
free electron laser diffraction and scattering experiments reveal that above-bandgap optical
pulses induce rapidly propagating acoustic pulses and a perturbation of the domain diffuse scattering
intensity arising from the nanoscale stripe domain configuration. With 400 nm optical excitation,
two separate acoustic pulses are observed: a high-amplitude pulse resulting from strong optical
absorption in the bottom electrode and a weaker pulse arising from the depolarization field screening
effect due to absorption directly within the superlattice. The picosecond scale variation of the
nanodomain diffuse scattering intensity is consistent with a larger polarization change than
would be expected due to the polarization-tetragonality coupling of uniformly polarized ferroelectrics.
The polarization change is consistent instead with polarization rotation facilitated by the reorientation
of the in-plane component of the polarization at the domain boundaries of the striped polarization
structure. The complex steady-state configuration within these ferroelectric heterostructures
leads to polarization rotation phenomena that have been previously available only through the
selection of bulk crystal composition.

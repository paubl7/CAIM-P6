Point defects in real crystals at finite temperatures are inevitable. Their dynamics severely
influence the mechanical properties of crystals under shear giving rise to nonlinear effects such
as ductility. Therefore, it is crucial to explore the interplay of the equilibrium point-defect
diffusion timescales and shear-induced timescales to understand the plastic deformation of crystals.
Using extensive nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we present a study on the yielding
behavior of cluster crystals (CC), an archetypal model for defect-rich crystals where the crystalline
structure is characterized by multiple occupancies (cluster) of particles at a lattice site. In
equilibrium, particles diffuse via site-to-site hopping keeping the crystalline structure intact.
We consider the CCs at a fixed density and different temperatures where it remains in the FCC structure,
and the diffusion timescales of particles vary depending on the temperature. We choose the range
of shear rates, which covers timescales higher and much lower than the equilibrium diffusion timescales
at high temperatures. For the considered range of shear rates and temperatures, both the macro and
microscopic responses of CCs to the shear suggest that the yielding scenario remains independent
of the diffusion of particles. It involves the plastic deformation of the underlying crystalline
structure. The averaged local bond order parameters and local angle measurements demonstrate
the structural changes and cooperative movement of the center of masses of the clusters close to
the yield point. A comparison with the soft-sphere (SS) FCC crystal reveals the similarities in
the yielding behavior of both systems. Nonetheless, diffusion of particles influences certain
features, such as a less prominent increase in the local bond order parameters and local angles close
to the yield point.

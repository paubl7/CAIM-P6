We present a comprehensive experimental and theoretical study of the pyrochlore Tb$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$,
an exemplary realization of a material whose properties are dominated by competition between magnetic
dipolar and electric quadrupolar correlations. Tb$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$ possesses a low-lying crystal
field level that disrupts the clean separation of energy scales commonly found in other rare earth
pyrochlores, imbuing this material with complex phase behavior. The dipolar and quadrupolar correlations
evolve over three distinct regimes that we characterize via heat capacity, elastic and inelastic
neutron scattering. In the first regime, above $T^*=1.1$ K, significant quadrupolar correlations
lead to an intense inelastic mode that cannot be accounted for within a scenario with solely dipole
correlations. The onset of extended dipole correlations occurs in the intermediate regime, between
$T^*=1.1$ K and $T_c = 0.25$ K, which constitutes a collective paramagnetic regime characterized
by extended short-range ordered spin ice domains. Here, long-range order is impeded not only by
the usual frustration, but also by a competition between dipolar and quadrupolar correlations.
Finally, in the lowest temperature regime, below $T_c=0.25$ K, there is an abrupt and significant
increase in the dipole ordered moment. The majority of the moment remains tied up in the ferromagnetic
spin ice-like state, but an additional $\mathbf{k}=(0,0,1)$ antiferromagnetic order parameter
also develops. Simultaneously, the spectral weight of the inelastic mode, which is a proxy for the
quadrupolar correlations, is observed to drop, indicating that dipole order ultimately wins out.
Tb$_2$Ge$_2$O$_7$ is therefore a remarkable platform to study intertwined dipolar and quadrupolar
correlations in a magnetically frustrated system and provides important insights into the physics
of the whole family of terbium pyrochlores.

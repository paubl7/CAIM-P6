Based on the multiband semiconductor Bloch equations a microscopic approach to high-harmonic
generation in crystalline solids which is able to properly describe degenerate bands and band crossings
is presented and analyzed. It is well-known that numerical band structure calculations typically
provide electronic wave functions with an undetermined k-dependent phase which results in matrix
elements which contain arbitrary k-dependent phases. In addition, such approaches usually mix
degenerate bands and bands with an energy difference smaller than the numerical precision in an
arbitrary way for each point in k-space. These ambiguities are problematic if one considers the
dynamics induced by electric fields since the matrix elements of the position operator involve
a derivative of the wave functions with respect to k. When the light-matter interaction is described
in the length gauge, the problem of arbitrary phases and degenerate subspace mixing of Bloch states
is solved by adopting a smooth gauge transformation along the field direction. The results obtained
within this method are validated by comparing with calculations in the velocity gauge. Although
we obtain in both gauges the same overall result, the length gauge is advantageous since it converges
with a smaller number of bands and thus requires significantly less numerical effort than the velocity
gauge. Also an unique distinction between inter- and intraband contributions and thus an instructive
physical interpretation is possible in the length gauge whereas in the velocity gauge this is unclear.
The computed polarization-direction-dependent high-harmonic spectra agree well with experimental
data reported for GaAs. Furthermore, it is demonstrated that, under proper conditions, the Berry
curvature is largely responsible for the even-order harmonics which are polarized perpendicular
to the driving field.

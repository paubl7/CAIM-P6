We examine the concurrence and entanglement entropy in quantum spin chains with random long-range
couplings, spatially decaying with a power-law exponent $\alpha$. Using the strong disorder renormalization
group (SDRG) technique, we find by analytical solution of the master equation a strong disorder
fixed point, characterized by a fixed point distribution of the couplings with a finite dynamical
exponent, which describes the system consistently in the regime $\alpha > 1/2$. A numerical implementation
of the SDRG method yields a power law spatial decay of the average concurrence, which is also confirmed
by exact numerical diagonalization. However, we find that the lowest-order SDRG approach is not
sufficient to obtain the typical value of the concurrence. We therefore implement a correction
scheme which allows us to obtain the leading order corrections to the random singlet state. This
approach yields a power-law spatial decay of the typical value of the concurrence, which we derive
both by a numerical implementation of the corrections and by analytics. Next, using numerical SDRG,
the entanglement entropy (EE) is found to be logarithmically enhanced for all $\alpha$, corresponding
to a critical behavior with an effective central charge $c = {\rm ln} 2$, independent of $\alpha$.
This is confirmed by an analytical derivation. Using numerical exact diagonalization (ED), we
confirm the logarithmic enhancement of the EE and a weak dependence on $\alpha$. For a wide range
of distances $l$, the EE fits a critical behavior with a central charge close to $c=1$, which is the
same as for the clean Haldane-Shastry model with a power-la-decaying interaction with $\alpha
=2$. Consistent with this observation, we find using ED that the concurrence shows power law decay,
albeit with smaller power exponents than obtained by SDRG.

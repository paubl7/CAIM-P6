We develop a theory for the three-terminal nonlocal conductance in Majorana nanowires as existing
in the superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures in the presence of superconducting proximity,
spin-orbit coupling, and Zeeman splitting. The key question addressed is whether such nonlocal
conductance can decisively distinguish between trivial and topological Majorana scenarios in
the presence of chemical potential inhomogeneity and random impurity disorder. We calculate the
local electrical as well as nonlocal electrical, and thermal conductance of the pristine nanowire
(good zero-bias conductance peaks), the nanowire in the presence of quantum dots and inhomogeneous
potential (bad zero-bias conductance peaks), and the nanowire in the presence of large disorder
(ugly zero-bias conductance peaks). The local conductance by itself is incapable of distinguishing
the trivial states from the topological states since zero-bias conductance peaks are generic in
the presence of disorder and inhomogeneous potential. The nonlocal conductance, which in principle
is capable of providing the bulk gap closing and reopening information at the topological quantum
phase transition, is found to be far too weak in magnitude to be particularly useful in the presence
of disorder and inhomogeneous potential. Therefore, we focus on the question of whether the combination
of the local, nonlocal electrical and the thermal conductance can separate the good, bad, and ugly
zero-bias conductance peaks in finite-length wires. Our paper aims to provide a guide to future
experiments, and we conclude that a combination of all three measurements would be necessary for
a decisive demonstration of topological Majorana zero modes in nanowires -- positive signals corresponding
to just one kind of measurements are likely to be false positives arising from disorder and inhomogeneous
potential.

Recently, a widely applicable system of hyperbolic partial differential equations has been derived
that enables the deterministic computation of a full heterogeneous stress field from a measured
deformation field, for example, from a strain field obtained via digital image correlation. This
information enables the determination of material properties, making this approach an alternative
to finite element model updating or the virtual fields method. This article focuses on developing
a finite volume discretization of this system of equations to address instabilities that arise
from violations of the Courant-Friedrichs-Lewy condition. The developed discretization enables
the system of equations to be applied to irregular geometries and finite deformation. We determine
how, in general, one may translate knowledge of the traction at the boundary into boundary conditions,
so that the numerical method can be applied to a variety of loading conditions. We analyse the solution
structure in the case of deformation discontinuities, and the results are applied to account for
discontinuities at the interfaces between finite volumes (this has relevance to other applications
such as composite materials). Interestingly, the discontinuities cause reflection and transmission
of the principal stresses. The finite volume discretization is validated using data output from
commercial finite element software. Furthermore, the discretization is applied to an experimental
uniaxial tension test with plastic deformation and necking. The strain field is obtained using
digital image correlation, and the stress field is computed using the developed finite volume discretization.
Together, these give the stress-strain behavior for each material element.

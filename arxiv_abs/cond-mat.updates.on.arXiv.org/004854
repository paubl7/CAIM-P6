Interfacing magnetism with superconducting condensates is rapidly emerging as a viable route
for the development of innovative quantum technologies. In this context, the development of rational
design strategies to controllably tune the interaction between magnetic moments is crucial. In
the metallic regime, the indirect interaction mediated by conduction electrons, the so-called
RKKY coupling, has been proven to be remarkably fertile in creating and controlling magnetic phenomena.
However, despite its potential, the possibility of using superconductivity to control the sign
and the strength of indirect interactions between magnet moments has never been explored so far.
Here we address this problem at its ultimate limit, demonstrating the possibility of maximally
tuning the interaction between local spins coupled through a superconducting condensate with
atomic scale precision. By using Cr atoms coupled to superconducting Nb as a prototypical system,
we use atomic manipulation techniques to precisely control the relative distance between local
spins along different crystallographic directions while simultaneously sensing their coupling
by scanning tunneling spectroscopy. Our results reveal the existence of highly anisotropic superconductor-mediated
indirect couplings between the local spins, lasting up to very long distances, up to 12 times the
lattice constant of Nb. Moreover, we demonstrate the possibility of controllably crossing a quantum
phase transition by acting on the direction and interatomic distance between spins. The extremely
high tunability provides novel opportunities for the realization of exotic phenomena such as topological
superconductivity and the rational design of magneto-superconducting interfaces.

Multi-crystalline silicon is widely used for producing low-cost and high-efficiency solar cells.
During crystal growth and device fabrication, silicon solar cells contain grain boundaries (GBs)
which are preferential segregation sites for atomic impurities such as oxygen atoms. GBs can induce
charge carriers recombination significantly reducing carrier lifetimes and therefore they can
be detrimental for Si device performance. We studied the correlation between structural, energetic
and electronic properties of {\Sigma}3{111} Si GB in the presence of vacancies, strain and multiple
O segregation. The study of the structural and energetic properties of GBs in the presence of strain
and vacancies gives an accurate description of the complex mechanisms that control the segregation
of oxygen atoms. We analysed tensile and compressive strain and we obtained that local tensile strain
around O impurities is very effective for segregation. We also studied the role of multiple O impurities
in the presence of Si vacancies finding that the segregation is favorite for those structures which
have restored tetrahedral covalent bonds. The presence of vacancies attract atomic impurities
in order to restore the electronic stability: the interstitial impurity becomes substitutional.
This analysis was the starting point to correlate the change of the electronic properties in {\Sigma}3{111}Si
GBs with O impurities in the presence of strain and vacancies. For each structure we analysed the
density of states and its projection on atoms and states, the band gaps, the segregation energy and
their correlation in order to characterise the nature of new energy levels. Actually, knowing the
origin of defined electronic states would allow the optimization of materials in order to reduce
non-radiative electron-hole recombination avoiding charge and energy losses and therefore improving
solar cell efficiency.

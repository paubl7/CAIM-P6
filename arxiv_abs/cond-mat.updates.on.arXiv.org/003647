In this paper, we continue our analysis of the interplay between pairing and non-Fermi liquid behavior
for a set of itinerant quantum-critical systems with an effective dynamical electron-electron
interaction $V(\Omega_m) \propto 1/|\Omega_m|^\gamma$ (the $\gamma$-model). In previous papers,
we considered the cases $0 < \gamma <1$ and $\gamma \approx 1$. We argued that (i) at $T=0$, there exists
an infinite, discrete set of solutions of the gap equation $\Delta_n (\omega_m)$, all with the same
spatial symmetry, but with different number ($n$) of sign changes, (ii) each $\Delta_n$ develops
at a particular onset temperature $T_{p,n}$, and (iii) $\Delta_n (\omega_m)$ and $T_{p,n}$ change
smoothly through $\gamma =1$, despite that the self-energy and the pairing vertex diverge at $\gamma
\geq 1$. The condensation energy, $E_{c,n}$ is the largest for $n=0$, but the presence of other solutions
gives rise to additional "longitudinal" gap fluctuations. Here, we analyze how the system behavior
evolves at $1<\gamma <2$, both on the Matsubara axis and in the upper half-plane of frequency. We
report two key new features, which develop at $\gamma \geq 1$ and become crucial at $\gamma \to 2$.
First, the spectrum of condensation energies become progressively more dense. Second, an array
of vortices emerges in the upper frequency half-plane, and the number of such vortices increases
with $\gamma$. We argue that this behavior is a non-trivial system reaction to the fact that on a real
axis, the real part of the dynamical electron-electron interaction $V' (\Omega) \propto \cos(\pi
\gamma/2)/|\Omega|^\gamma$ becomes repulsive for $\gamma >1$, and the imaginary part $V^{''}
(\Omega) \propto \sin(\pi \gamma/2)/|\Omega|^\gamma$ decreases as $\gamma \to 2$.

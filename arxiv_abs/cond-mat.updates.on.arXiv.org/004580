Voltage-gate assisted spin-orbit torque (VGSOT) writing scheme combines the advantages from
voltage control of magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) and spin-orbit torque (SOT) effects, enabling multiple
benefits for magnetic random access memory (MRAM) applications. In this work, we give a complete
description of VGSOT writing properties on perpendicular magnetic tunnel junction (pMTJ) devices,
and we propose a detailed methodology for its electrical characterization. The impact of gate assistance
on the SOT switching characteristics are investigated using electrical pulses down to 400ps. The
VCMA coefficient ({\xi}) extracted from current switching scheme is found to be the same as that
from the magnetic field switch method, which is in the order of 15fJ/Vm for the 80nm to 150nm devices.
Moreover, as expected from the pure electronic VCMA effect, {\xi} is revealed to be independent
of the writing speed and gate length. We observe that SOT switching current characteristics are
modified linearly with gate voltage (V_g), similar as for the magnetic properties. We interpret
this linear behavior as the direct modification of perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) and
nucleation energy induced by VCMA. At V_g = 1V, the SOT write current is decreased by 25%, corresponding
to a 45% reduction in total energy down to 30fJ/bit at 400ps speed for the 80nm devices used in this
study. Further, the device-scaling criteria are proposed, and we reveal that VGSOT scheme is of
great interest as it can mitigate the complex material requirements of achieving high SOT and VCMA
parameters for scaled MTJs. Finally, how that VGSOT-MRAM can enable high-density arrays close
to two terminal geometries, with high-speed performance and low-power operation, showing great
potential for embedded memories as well as in-memory computing applications at advanced technology
nodes.

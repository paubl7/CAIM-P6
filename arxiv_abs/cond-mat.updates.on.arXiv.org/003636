Recently, uncovering the sources of thermal Hall effect in insulators has become an important issue.
In the case of ferromagnetic insulators, it is well known that Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction
can induce magnon thermal Hall effect. Specifically, the DM vector parallel to the magnetization
direction induces complex magnon hopping amplitudes, so that magnons act as if they feel Lorentz
force. However, the DM vector which is orthogonal to the magnetization direction has hitherto been
neglected as a possible source of magnon thermal Hall effect. This is because they play no role in
the linear spin wave theory, an often invoked approximation when computing the magnon thermal Hall
effect. Here, we challenge this expectation by presenting the self-consistent Schwinger-boson
mean field study of two-dimensional magnets with ferromagnetic Heisenberg interaction and in-plane
DM interaction. We find that the relevant Schwinger-boson mean field Hamiltonian takes the form
of two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin-orbit interaction, which is known to show anomalous
Hall effect, spin Hall effect, and Rashba-Edelstein effect, whose thermal counterparts also appear
in our system. Importantly, the thermal Hall effect can be induced when out-of-plane magnetic field
is applied, and persists even when the magnetic field is large, so that the spins are significantly
polarized, and the linear spin wave theory is expected to be a reasonable approximation. Since the
linear spin wave theory predicts vanishing thermal Hall effect, our result implies that linear
spin wave is not a sufficient approximation, and that magnon-magnon interaction must be taken into
account to predict the correct thermal Hall conductivity.

Our aim is to explore the effect of modelling the collision terms by Bhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK),
to ensure that each collision conserves particle number, momentum and energy, on the charge and
heat transport of a hot quark matter in a strong magnetic field (B), unlike the conservation of particle
on the average of a cycle in collision terms of relaxation type. In addition, we explore the effect
of the quasiparticle description of partons on the transport process with medium masses calculated
by perturbative thermal QCD in the backgroung of strong B. The modified collision term enhances
both conductivities, which are itself increasing with both temperature and strength of magnetic
field (B). The effect of the collision term is more pronounced in the high temperature region. As
a consequence, the Lorenz number, $L$ $(=\kappa/\sigma_{el}T)$ becomes independent of $B$ and
gets reduced and decreases monotonically with the temperature, resulting a weak violation of the
Wiedemann-Franz Law, compared to the nearly constancy with collision terms of relaxation type.
Whereas the Knudsen number ($\Omega$) gets amplified, compared to the relaxation collision term
and it increases with both $T$ and $B$, but the increase with $B$ is meager. However, in the quasiparticle
descriptionof partons, the characteristic dependence of conductivities on $T$ become interesting:
both $\sigma_{el}$ and $\kappa$ gets reduced by an order of magnitude and $\sigma_{el}$ ($\kappa$)
decreases (increases) with $T$ monotonically. Hence, $L$ gets increased, compared to the noninteracting
description and decreases rapidly with $T$ but increases with $B$. On the contrary, $\Omega$ becomes
smaller and shows a decreasing trend {\em especially} with $T$.

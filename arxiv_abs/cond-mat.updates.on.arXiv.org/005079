We extend Expanded Wang-Landau (EWL) simulations beyond classical systems and develop the EWL
method for systems modeled with a tight-binding Hamiltonian. We then apply the method to determine
the partition function and thus all thermodynamic properties, including the Gibbs free energy
and entropy, of the fluid phases of Si. We compare the results from quantum many-body (QMB) tight
binding models, which explicitly calculate the overlap between the atomic orbitals of neighboring
atoms, to those obtained with classical many-body force fields (CMB), which allow to recover the
tetrahedral organization in condensed phases of Si through e.g. a repulsive 3-body term that favors
the ideal tetrahedral angle. Along the vapor-liquid coexistence, between 3000K and 6000K, the
densities for the two coexisting phases are found to vary significantly (by $5$ orders of magnitude
for the vapor and by up to 25% for the liquid) and to provide a stringent test of the models. Transitions
from vapor to liquid are predicted to occur for chemical potentials that are $10-15$% higher for
CMB models than for QMB models, and a ranking of the force fields is provided by comparing the predictions
for the vapor pressure to the experimental data. QMB models also reveal the formation of a gap in the
electronic density of states of the coexisting liquid at high temperatures. Subjecting Si to a nanoscopic
confinement has a dramatic effect on the phase diagram, with e.g. at 6000K a decrease in liquid densities
by about 50% for both CMB and QMB models and an increase in vapor densities between 90% (CMB) and 170%
(QMB). The results presented here provide a full picture of the impact of the strategy (CMB or QMB)
chosen to model many-body effects on the thermodynamic properties of the fluid phases of Si.

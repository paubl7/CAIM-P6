Electropolymerization is a bottom-up materials engineering process of micro and nano-scale that
utilizes electrical signals to deposit conducting dendrites' morphologies by a redox reaction
in the liquid phase. It resembles synaptogenesis in the brain, in which electrical stimulation
in the brain causes the formation of synapses from the cellular neural composites. The strategy
has been recently explored for neuromorphic engineering by establishing link between the electrical
signals and the dendrites' shapes. Since the geometry of these structures determines their electrochemical
properties, understanding the mechanisms that regulate the polymer assembly under electrically
programmed conditions is an important aspect. In this manuscript, we simulate this phenomenon
using mesoscale simulations, taking into account the important features of spatial-temporal
potential mapping based on the time-varying signal, the motion of charged particles in the liquid
due to the electric field, and the attachment of particles on the electrode. The study helps in visualizing
the motion of particles in different electrical conditions, which is not possible to probe experimentally.
Consistent with the experiments, the higher AC frequency of electrical activities favors linear
wire-like growth, while lower frequency leads to more dense and fractal dendrites growth, and voltage
offset leads to asymmetrical growth. We find that dendrites' shape and growth process systematically
depend on particle concentration and random scattering. We discover that the different dendrites'
architectures are associated with different Laplace and diffusion fields, which govern the monomers
trajectory and subsequent dendrites' growth. Such unconventional engineering routes could have
a variety of applications from neuromorphic engineering to bottom-up computing strategies.

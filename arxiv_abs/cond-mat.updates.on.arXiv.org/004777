Topological electronic flatten bands near or at the Fermi level are a promising avenue towards unconventional
superconductivity and correlated insulating states. In this work, we present a catalogue of all
the three-dimensional stoichiometric materials with flat bands around the Fermi level that exist
in nature. We consider 55,206 materials from the Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) catalogued
using the Topological Quantum Chemistry website which provides their structural parameters,
space group (SG), band structure, density of states and topological characterization. We identify
several signatures and properties of band flatness: bandwidth, peaks in the density of states,
band topology, range of momenta over which the band is flat and the energy window around the Fermi
level where the flat bands is situated. Moreover, we perform a high-throughput analysis of all crystal
structures to identify those hosting line-graph or bipartite sublattices -- either in two or three
dimensions -- that likely lead to flat bands. From this trove of information, we create the Materials
Flatband Database website, a powerful search engine for future theoretical and experimental studies.
We use it to manually extract a curated list of 2,379 materials potentially hosting flat bands whose
charge centers are not strongly localized on the atomic sites, out of which we present in minute details
the 345 most promising ones. In addition, we showcase five representative materials (KAg[CN]2
in SG 163 $(P\bar{3}1c)$, Pb2Sb2O7 in SG 227 $(Fd\bar{3}m)$, Rb2CaH4 in SG 139 $(I4/mmm)$, Ca2NCl
in SG 166 $(R\bar{3}m)$ and WO3 in SG 221 $(Pm\bar{3}m)$) and provide a theoretical explanation
for the origin of their flat bands that close to the Fermi energy using the S-matrix method introduced
in a parallel work [Calugaru et al.].

Recent advances in machine learning have become increasingly popular in the applications of phase
transitions and critical phenomena. By machine learning approaches, we try to identify the physical
characteristics in the two-dimensional percolation model. To achieve this, we adopt Monte Carlo
simulation to generate dataset at first, and then we employ several approaches to analyze the dataset.
Four kinds of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), one variational autoencoder (VAE), one convolutional
VAE (cVAE), one principal component analysis (PCA), and one $k$-means are used for identifying
order parameter, the permeability, and the critical transition point. The former three kinds of
CNNs can simulate the two order parameters and the permeability with high accuracy, and good extrapolating
performance. The former two kinds of CNNs have high anti-noise ability. To validate the robustness
of the former three kinds of CNNs, we also use the VAE and the cVAE to generate new percolating configurations
to add perturbations into the raw configurations. We find that there is no difference by using the
raw or the perturbed configurations to identify the physical characteristics, under the prerequisite
of corresponding labels. In the case of lacking labels, we use unsupervised learning to detect the
physical characteristics. The PCA, a classical unsupervised learning, performs well when identifying
the permeability but fails to deduce order parameter. Hence, we apply the fourth kinds of CNNs with
different preset thresholds, and identify a new order parameter and the critical transition point.
Our findings indicate that the effectiveness of machine learning still needs to be evaluated in
the applications of phase transitions and critical phenomena.

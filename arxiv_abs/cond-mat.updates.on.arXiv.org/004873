The recent measurement of a very low dielectric constant, $\epsilon$, of water confined in nanometric
slit pores leads us to reconsider the physical basis of ion partitioning into nanopores. For confined
ions in chemical equilibrium with a bulk of dielectric constant $\epsilon_b>\epsilon$, three
physical mechanisms, at the origin of ion exclusion in nanopores, are expected to be modified due
to this dielectric mismatch: dielectric exclusion at the water-pore interface (with membrane
dielectric constant, $\epsilon_m<\epsilon$), the solvation energy related to the difference
in Debye-H\"uckel screening parameters in the pore, $\kappa$, and in the bulk $\kappa_b$, and the
classical Born solvation self-energy proportional to $\epsilon^{-1}-\epsilon_b^{-1}$. Our
goal is to clarify the interplay between these three mechanisms and investigate the role played
by the Born contribution in ionic liquid-vapor (LV) phase separation in confined geometries. We
first compute analytically the potential of mean force (PMF) of an ion of radius $R_i$ located at
the center of a nanometric spherical pore of radius $R$. Computing the variational grand potential
for a solution of confined ions, we then deduce the partition coefficients of ions in the pore. Phase
diagrams of the LV transition are established for various parameter values and we show that a signature
of this phase transition can be detected by monitoring the total osmotic pressure. For charged nanopores,
these exclusion effects compete with the electrostatic attraction that imposes the entry of counterions
into the pore to enforce electro-neutrality. This study will therefore help in deciphering the
respective roles of the Born self-energy and dielectric mismatch in experiments and simulations
of ionic transport through nanopores.

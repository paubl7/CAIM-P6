The rheology of a dilute binary mixture of inertial suspension under simple shear flow is analyzed
in the context of the Boltzmann kinetic equation. The effect of the surrounding viscous gas on the
solid particles is accounted for by means of a deterministic viscous drag force plus a stochastic
Langevin-like term defined in terms of the environmental temperature $T_\text{env}$. Grad's
moment method is employed to determine the temperature ratio and the pressure tensor in terms of
the coefficients of restitution, concentration, the masses and diameters of the components of
the mixture and the environmental temperature. Analytical results are compared against event-driven
Langevin simulations for mixtures of hard spheres with the same mass density [$m_1/m_2=(\sigma_1/\sigma_2)^3$,
$m_i$ and $\sigma_i$ being the mass and diameter, respectively, of the species $i$)]. It is confirmed
that the theoretical predictions agree with simulations of various size ratios $\sigma_1/\sigma_2$
and for elastic and inelastic collisions in the wide range of parameters' space. It is remarkable
that the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$ and the viscosity ratio $\eta_1/\eta_2$ ($\eta_i$ being
the partial contribution of the component $i$ to the total shear viscosity $\eta=\eta_1+\eta_2$)
discontinuously change at a certain shear rate as the size ratio increases; this feature (which
is expected to occur in the thermodynamic limit) cannot be captured by simulations due to small system
size. In addition, a Bhatnagar--Gross--Krook (BGK)-type kinetic model adapted to mixtures of
inelastic hard spheres is exactly solved when $T_\text{env}$ is much smaller than the kinetic temperature
$T$. A comparison between the velocity distribution functions obtained from Grad's method, BGK
model, and simulations is carried out.

The efficiency of nanoparticle (NP) solar cells has grown impressively in recent years, exceeding
16%. However, the carrier mobility in NP solar cells, and in other optoelectronic applications
remains low, thus critically limiting their performance. Therefore, carrier transport in NP solids
needs to be better understood to further improve the overall efficiency of NP solar cell technology.
However, it is technically challenging to simulate experimental scale samples, as physical processes
from atomic to mesoscopic scales all crucially impact transport. To rise to this challenge, here
we report the development of TRIDENS: the Transport in Defected Nanoparticle Solids Simulator,
that adds three more hierarchical layers to our previously developed HINTS code for nanoparticle
solar cells. In TRIDENS, we first introduced planar defects, such as twin planes and grain boundaries
into individual NP SLs that comprised the order of 10^3 NPs. Then we used HINTS to simulate the transport
across tens of thousands of defected NP SLs, and constructed the distribution of the NP SL mobilities
with planar defects. Second, the defected NP SLs were assembled into a resistor network with more
than 10^4 NP SLs, thus representing about 10^7 individual NPs. Finally, the TRIDENS results were
analyzed by finite size scaling to explore whether the percolation transition, separating the
phase where the low mobility defected NP SLs percolate, from the phase where the high mobility undefected
NP SLs percolate drives a low-mobility-to-high-mobility transport crossover that can be extrapolated
to macroscopic length scales. For the theoretical description, we adapted the Efros-Shklovskii
bimodal mobility distribution percolation model. We demonstrated that the ES bimodal theory's
two-variable scaling function is an effective tool to quantitatively characterize this low-mobility-to-high-mobility
transport crossover.

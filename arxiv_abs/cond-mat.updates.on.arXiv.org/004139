Since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates, Josephson junction based
phasesensitive experiments are believed and used to provide the most convincing evidence for determining
the pairing symmetry. Regardless of different junction materials and geometries used, quantum
tunneling involved in these experiments is essentially a nanoscale process, and thus, actual experimental
results are extremely sensitive to atomic details of the junction structures. The situation has
led to controversial results as to the nature of the pairing symmetry of cuprates: while in-plane
junction experiments generally support d-wave pairing symmetry, those based on out-of-plane
(c-axis) Josephson junctions between two rotated cuprate blocks favor s-wave pairing. In this
work, we revisit the c-axis experiment by fabricating Josephson junctions with atomic-level control
in their interface structure. We fabricate over 50 junctions of ultrathin Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}
(BSCCO) flakes by state-of-the-art exfoliation technique and obtain atomically flat junction
interfaces in the whole junction regions as characterized by high resolution transmission electron
microscopy (TEM). Notably, the resultant uniform junctions at various twist angles all exhibit
a single tunneling branch behavior, suggesting that only the first half a unit cell on both sides
of the twisted flakes is involved in Josephson tunneling process. With such well-defined geometry/structure
and the characteristic single tunneling branch, we repeatedly observe Josephson tunneling at
a nominal twist angle of 45 degrees, which is against the expectation from a purely d-wave pairing
scenario. Our results unambiguously demonstrate a persistent s-wave order parameter in the junction.

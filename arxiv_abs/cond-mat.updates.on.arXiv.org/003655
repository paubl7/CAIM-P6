Organic solar cells (OSCs) containing an active layer consisting of a nanostructured blend of a
conjugated polymer like poly(3-hexylthiophene) (P3HT) and an electron acceptor molecule have
the potential of competing against silicon-based photovoltaic panels. However, this potential
is unfulfilled primarily due to interrelated production and stability issues. The generally employed
spin coating process for fabricating organic solar cells cannot be scaled up. Recently, He et al.,
have reported that the gelation of P3HT with [6,6]-phenyl-C61-butyric acid methyl ester (PC60BM)
under sub-ambient conditions can provide a continuous extrusion/coating based route to the processing
of organic solar cells and that increases in power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) of the P3HT/PC60BM
active layer are possible under certain shearing and thermal histories of the P3HT/PC60BM gels.
Here oscillatory and steady torsional flows were used to investigate the gel formation dynamics
of P3HT with a recently proposed non-fullerene o-IDTBR under sub-ambient conditions. The gel strengths
defined on the basis of linear viscoelastic material functions as determined via small-amplitude
oscillatory shear were observed to be functions of the P3HT and o-IDTBR concentrations, the solvent
used and the shearing conditions. Overall, the gels which formed upon quenching to sub-zero temperatures
were found to be stable during small-amplitude oscillatory shear (linear viscoelastic range)
but broke down even at the relatively low shear rates associated with steady torsional flows, suggesting
that the shearing conditions used during the processing of gels of P3HT with small molecule acceptor
blends can alter the gel structure and possibly affect the resulting active layer performance.

Condensed matter systems admit topological collective excitations above a trivial ground state,
an example being Chern insulators formed by Dirac bosons with a gap at finite energies. However,
in contrast to electrons, there is no particle-number conservation law for collective excitations.
This gives rise to particle number-nonconserving many-body interactions whose influence on single-particle
topology is an open issue of fundamental interest in the field of topological quantum materials.
Taking magnons in ferromagnets as an example, we uncover topological magnon insulators that are
stabilized by interactions through opening Chern-insulating gaps in the magnon spectrum. This
can be traced back to the fact that the particle-number nonconserving interactions break the effective
time-reversal symmetry of the harmonic theory. Hence, magnon-magnon interactions are a source
of topology that can introduce chiral edge states, whose chirality depends on the magnetization
direction. Importantly, interactions do not necessarily cause detrimental damping but can give
rise to topological magnons with exceptionally long lifetimes. We identify two mechanisms of interaction-induced
topological phase transitions---one driven by an external field, the other by temperature---and
show that they cause unconventional sign reversals of transverse transport signals, in particular
of the thermal Hall conductivity. We identify candidate materials where this many-body mechanism
is expected to occur, such as the metal-organic kagome-lattice magnet Cu(1,3-benzenedicarboxylate),
the van der Waals honeycomb-lattice magnet CrI$_3$, and the multiferroic kamiokite (Fe$_2$Mo$_3$O$_8$).
Our results demonstrate that interactions can play an important role in generating nontrivial
topology.

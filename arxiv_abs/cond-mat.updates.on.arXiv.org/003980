Quantum states are represented by positive semidefinite Hermitian operators with unit trace,
known as density matrices. An important subset of quantum states is that of separable states, the
complement of which is the subset of \textit{entangled} states. We show that the problem of deciding
whether a quantum state is entangled can be seen as a moment problem in real analysis. Only a small
number of such moments are accessible experimentally, and so in practice the question of quantum
entanglement of a many-body system can be reduced to a truncated moment problem. By considering
quantum entanglement of $n$ identical atoms we arrive at the truncated moment problem defined for
symmetric measures over a product of $n$ copies of unit balls in $\mathbb{R}^d$. We work with moments
up to degree $2$. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for belonging to the moment cone,
which can be expressed via a linear matrix inequality of size at most $2d+2$, which is independent
of $n$. The linear matrix inequalities can be converted into a set of explicit semialgebraic inequalities
giving necessary and sufficient conditions for membership in the moment cone, and show that the
two conditions approach each other in the limit of large $n$. The inequalities are derived via considering
the dual cone of nonnegative polynomials, and its sum-of-squares relaxation. We show that the sum-of-squares
relaxation of the dual cone is asymptotically exact, and using symmetry reduction techniques (J.
Pure Appl. Algebra 192, no. 1-3, 95, arXiv:1205.3102), it can be written as a small linear matrix
inequality of size at most $2d+2$, which is independent of $n$. For the cone of symmetric nonnegative
polynomials with the relevant support we also prove an analogue of the half-degree principle for
globally nonnegative symmetric polynomials (J. Math. Anal. Appl. 284, no. 1, 174, J. Pure Appl.
Algebra 216, no. 4, 850).

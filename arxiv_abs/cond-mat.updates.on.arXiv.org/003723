In this thesis, we considered quantum systems coupled to several baths. We supposed that the system
state is governed by the quantum master equation (QME). We investigated the quantum pump and the
excess entropy production. In the first half of the thesis, we investigated the quantum pump using
the full counting statistics with quantum master equation (FCS-QME) approach. In the latter part
of the thesis, we investigated the excess entropy production. The average entropy production is
composed of the time integral of the instantaneous steady entropy production rate and the excess
entropy production. We define average entropy production rate using the average energy and particle
currents, which are calculated by using the full counting statistics with QME. The excess entropy
production is given by a line integral in the control parameter space and its integrand is called
the Berry-Sinitsyn-Nemenman (BSN) vector. In the weakly nonequilibrium regime, we show that BSN
vector is described by $\ln \rho_0^{(-1)}$ and $\rho_0$ where $\rho_0$ is the instantaneous steady
state of the QME and $\rho_0^{(-1)}$ is that of the QME which is given by reversing the sign of the Lamb
shift term. In general, the potential dose not exist. The origins of the non-existence of the potential
are a quantum effect (the Lamb shift) and the breaking of the time-reversal symmetry. The non-existence
of the potential means that the excess entropy essentially depends on the path of the modulation.
If the system Hamiltonian is non-degenerate or the Lamb shift term is negligible, the excess entropy
production approximately reduces to the difference between the von Neumann entropies of the system.
We pointed out that the expression of the entropy production obtained in the classical Markov jump
process is different from our result and showed that these are approximately equivalent only in
the weakly nonequilibrium regime.

The dramatic slowing down of relaxation dynamics of liquids approaching the glass transition remains
a highly debated problem, where the crux of the puzzle resides in the elusive increase of the activation
barrier $\Delta E(T)$ with decreasing temperature $T$. A class of theoretical frameworks -- known
as elastic models -- attribute this temperature dependence to the variations of the liquid's macroscopic
elasticity, quantified by the high-frequency shear modulus $G_\infty(T)$. While elastic models
find some support in a number of experimental studies, these models do not take into account the spatial
structures, length scales, and heterogeneity associated with structural relaxation in supercooled
liquids. Here, we propose that viscous slowing down is controlled by a mesoscopic elastic stiffness
$\kappa(T)$, defined as the characteristic stiffness of response fields to local dipole forces
in the liquid's underlying inherent states. First, we show that $\kappa(T)$ -- which is intimately
related to the energy and length scales characterizing quasilocalized, nonphononic excitations
in glasses -- increases more strongly with decreasing $T$ than the macroscopic inherent state shear
modulus $G(T)$ in several computer liquids. Second, we show that the simple relation $\Delta E(T)\propto\kappa(T)$
holds remarkably well for some computer liquids, implying a direct connection between the liquid's
underlying mesoscopic elasticity and enthalpic energy barriers. On the other hand, we show that
for other computer liquids, the above relation fails. Finally, we provide strong evidence that
what distinguishes computer liquids in which the $\Delta E(T) \propto \kappa(T)$ relation holds,
from those in which it does not, is that the latter feature highly granular potential energy landscapes,
where many sub-basins separated by low activation barriers exist. [Rest of abstract abridged]

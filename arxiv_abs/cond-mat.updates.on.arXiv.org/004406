We construct a functional path integral for a stochastic hybrid reaction-diffusion (RD) equation,
in which the reaction term depends on the discrete state of a randomly switching environment. We
proceed by spatially discretizing the RD system and using operator methods and coherent spin states
to derive a path integral representation of the lattice model. The path integral specifies the distribution
of trajectories in a state-space consisting of the set of local concentrations and the environmental
state. Taking the continuum limit yields a path integral for the stochastic hybrid RD equation.
We show how in the semi-classical limit, the stochastic dynamics reduces to a system of Langevin
equations. The latter consists of an RD equation coupled to a stochastic probability function $z$
that evolved according to an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with multiplicative noise. On eliminating
the variable $z$, we obtain an RD equation driven by nonlocal spatiotemporal noise. This is used
to determine leading order corrections to the mean-field RD equation. We then apply the theory to
the example of diffusion with stochastically gated adsorption under dimerization. Comparison
with the classical problem of diffusion-limited pair-annihilation suggests that the adsorption
model exhibits anomalous large-time behavior in one and two spatial dimensions. This motivates
an alternative path integral formulation based on an RD master equation that treats diffusion as
a set of hopping reactions and incorporates the effects of a randomly switching environment. A small
noise expansion now yields a stochastic RD equation with both real and complex noise sources. Finally,
diagrammatic and renormalization group methods are used to determine the anomalous large-time
behavior of the mean concentration at the upper critical dimension $d_c=2$.

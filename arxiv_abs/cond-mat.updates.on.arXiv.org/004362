Modeling living systems at the collective scale can be very challenging because the individual
constituents can themselves be complex and the respective interactions between the constituents
are not fully understood. With the advent of high throughput experiments and in the age of big data,
data-driven methods are on the rise to overcome these challenges. Although machine-learning approaches
can help quantify correlations between the various players, they do not directly shed light on the
underlying physical principles of such systems. To directly illuminate the underlying physical
principles, we present a data-driven method for obtaining the single particle density, from which
physical quantities can be readily extracted, as well as for solving the Boltzmann equation for
active matter -- a leading candidate for quantifying living systems. If the system is near a steady
state, a field theory can be inferred to subsequently make physical predictions about the system.
The method is first developed analytically for a scalar field and subsequently calibrated using
simulated data. The method is then applied to an experimental system of particles actively-driven
by a {\it Serratia marcescens} bacterial swarm and in the presence of spatially-localized UV light.
The analysis demonstrates that the particles are in steady state before and some time after the UV
light and obey a Gaussian field theory with a spatially-varying "mass". We use our data-driven method
to obtain the chemical potential, pressure, and entropy of the particulate system. Specifically,
we demonstrate that the entropy of the particles increases in response to the UV light. In response
to the UV light, there is net flow of the particles away from the UV light. We conclude with discussing
other potential applications of the method to demonstrate its breadth.

Lateral inhomogeneities in the formation of 2-dimensional electron gases (2DEG) directly influence
their electronic properties. Understanding their origin is an important factor for fundamental
interpretations, as well as high quality devices. Here, we studied the local formation of the buried
2DEG at LaAlO3/SrTiO3 (LAO/STO) interfaces grown on STO (100) single crystals with partial TiO2
termination, utilizing in-situ local conductivity atomic force microscopy (LC-AFM) and scattering-type
scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). Using substrates with different degrees of
chemical surface termination, we can link the resulting interface chemistry to an inhomogeneous
2DEG formation. In conductivity maps recorded by LC-AFM, a significant lack of conductivity is
observed at topographic features, indicative of a local SrO/AlO2 interface stacking order, while
significant local conductivity can be probed in regions showing TiO2/LaO interface stacking order.
These results could be corroborated by s SNOM, showing a similar contrast distribution in the optical
signal which can be linked to the local electronic properties of the material. The results are further
complimented by low-temperature conductivity measurements, which show an increasing residual
resistance at 5 K with increasing portion of insulating SrO terminated areas. Therefore, we can
correlate the macroscopic electrical behavior of our samples to its nanoscopic structure. Using
proper parameters, 2DEG mapping can be carried out without any visible alteration of sample properties,
proving LC AFM and s SNOM to be viable and destruction-free techniques for the identification of
local 2DEG formation. Furthermore, applying LC AFM and s SNOM in this manner opens the exciting prospect
to link macroscopic low temperature transport to its nanoscopic origin.

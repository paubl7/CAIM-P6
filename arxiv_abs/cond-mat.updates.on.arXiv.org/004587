We characterize the soliton solutions and their interactions for a system of coupled evolution
equations of nonlinear Schr\"odinger (NLS) type that models the dynamics in one-dimensional repulsive
Bose-Einstein condensates with spin one, taking advantage of the representation of such model
as a special reduction of a 2 x 2 matrix NLS system. Specifically, we study in detail the case in which
solutions tend to a non-zero background at space infinities. First we derive a compact representation
for the multi-soliton solutions in the system using the Inverse Scattering Transform (IST). We
introduce the notion of canonical form of a solution, corresponding to the case when the background
is proportional to the identity. We show that solutions for which the asymptotic behavior at infinity
is not proportional to the identity, referred to as being in non-canonical form, can be reduced to
canonical form by unitary transformations that preserve the symmetric nature of the solution (physically
corresponding to complex rotations of the quantization axes). Then we give a complete characterization
of the two families of one-soliton solutions arising in this problem, corresponding to ferromagnetic
and to polar states of the system, and we discuss how the physical parameters of the solitons for each
family are related to the spectral data in the IST. We also show that any ferromagnetic one-soliton
solution in canonical form can be reduced to a single dark soliton of the scalar NLS equation, and
any polar one-soliton solution in canonical form is unitarily equivalent to a pair of oppositely
polarized displaced scalar dark solitons up to a rotation of the quantization axes. Finally, we
discuss two-soliton interactions and we present a complete classification of the possible scenarios
that can arise depending on whether either soliton is of ferromagnetic or polar type.

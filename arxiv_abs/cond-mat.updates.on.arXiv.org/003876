Lateral superlattices in 2D materials are emerging as a powerful platform for exploring novel quantum
phenomena, which can be realized through the proximity coupling in forming moir\'e pattern with
another layer. This approach, however, is invasive, material-specific, and requires small lattice
mismatch and suitable band alignment, largely limited to graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides
(TMDs). Hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) of anti-parallel (AA') stacking order has been an indispensable
building block, as dielectric substrates and capping layers for realizing high quality van der
Waals devices. There is also emerging interest on parallelly aligned h-BN of Bernal (AB) stacking,
where the broken inversion and mirror symmetries lead to out-of-plane electrical polarization
with sign controlled by interlayer translation. Here we show that the laterally patterned electrical
polarization at a nearly parallel interface within the h-BN substrate or capping layer can be exploited
to create non-invasively a universal superlattice potential in general 2D materials. The feasibility
is demonstrated by first principle calculations for monolayer MoSe2, black phosphorus, and antiferromagnetic
MnPSe3 on such h-BN substrate. The potential strength can reach 200 meV, customizable in this range
through choice of vertical distance of target material from the interface in h-BN. We also find sizable
out-of-plane electric field at the h-BN surface, which can realize superlattice potential for
interlayer excitons in TMD bilayers as well as dipolar molecules. The idea is further generalized
to AB stacked h-BN film subject to torsion with adjacent layers all twisted with an angle, which allows
the potential and field strength to be scaled up with film thickness, saturating to a quasi-periodic
one with chiral structure.

We present a realization of a fast interfacial Marangoni microswimmer by a half-spherical alginate
capsule at the air-water interface, which diffusively releases water-soluble spreading molecules
(weak surfactants such as polyethylene glycol (PEG)), which act as "fuel" by modulating the air-water
interfacial tension. For a number of different fuels, we can observe symmetry breaking and spontaneous
propulsion although the alginate particle and emission are isotropic. The propulsion mechanism
is similar to soap or camphor boats, which are, however, typically asymmetric in shape or emission
to select a swimming direction. We develop a theory of Marangoni boat propulsion starting from low
Reynolds numbers by analyzing the coupled problems of surfactant diffusion and advection and fluid
flow, which includes surfactant-induced fluid Marangoni flow, and surfactant adsorption at the
air-water interface; we also include a possible evaporation of surfactant. The swimming velocity
is determined by the balance of drag and Marangoni forces. We show that spontaneous symmetry breaking
resulting in propulsion is possible above a critical dimensionless surfactant emission rate (Peclet
number). We derive the relation between Peclet number and swimming speed and generalize to higher
Reynolds numbers utilizing the concept of the Nusselt number. The theory explains the observed
swimming speeds for PEG-alginate capsules, and we unravel the differences to other Marangoni boat
systems based on camphor, which are mainly caused by surfactant evaporation from the liquid-air
interface. The capsule Marangoni microswimmers also exhibit surfactant-mediated repulsive
interactions with walls, which can be qualitatively explained by surfactant accumulation at the
wall.

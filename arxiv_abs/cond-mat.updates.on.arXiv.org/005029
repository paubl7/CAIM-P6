Interatomic potentials (IPs) are reduced-order models for calculating the potential energy of
a system of atoms given their positions in space and species. IPs treat atoms as classical particles
without explicitly modeling electrons and thus are computationally far less expensive than first-principles
methods, enabling molecular simulations of significantly larger systems over longer times. Developing
an IP is a complex iterative process involving multiple steps: assembling a training set, designing
a functional form, optimizing the function parameters, testing model quality, and deployment
to molecular simulation packages. This paper introduces the KIM-based learning-integrated fitting
framework (KLIFF), a package that facilitates the entire IP development process. KLIFF supports
both analytic and machine learning IPs. It adopts a modular approach whereby various components
in the fitting process, such as atomic environment descriptors, functional forms, loss functions,
optimizers, quality analyzers, and so on, work seamlessly with each other. This provides a flexible
framework for the rapid design of new IP forms. Trained IPs are compatible with the Knowledgebase
of Interatomic Models (KIM) application programming interface (API) and can be readily used in
major materials simulation packages compatible with KIM, including ASE, DL_POLY, GULP, LAMMPS,
and QC. KLIFF is written in Python with computationally intensive components implemented in C++.
It is parallelized over data and supports both shared-memory multicore desktop machines and high-performance
distributed memory computing clusters. We demonstrate the use of KLIFF by fitting an analytic Stillinger--Weber
potential and a machine learning neural network potential for silicon. The KLIFF package, together
with its documentation, is publicly available at: https://github.com/openkim/kliff.

Twist engineering, or the alignment of two-dimensional (2D) crystalline layers with desired orientations,
has led to tremendous success in modulating the charge degree of freedom in hetero- and homo-structures,
in particular, in achieving novel correlated and topological electronic phases in moir\'e electronic
crystals. However, although pioneering theoretical efforts have predicted nontrivial magnetism
and magnons out of twisting 2D magnets, experimental realization of twist engineering spin degree
of freedom remains elusive. Here, we leverage the archetypal 2D Ising magnet chromium triiodide
(CrI3) to fabricate twisted double bilayer homostructures with tunable twist angles and demonstrate
the successful twist engineering of 2D magnetism in them. Using linear and circular polarization-resolved
Raman spectroscopy, we identify magneto-Raman signatures of a new magnetic ground state that is
sharply distinct from those in natural bilayer (2L) and four-layer (4L) CrI3. With careful magnetic
field and twist angle dependence, we reveal that, for a very small twist angle (~ 0.5 degree), this
emergent magnetism can be well-approximated by a weighted linear superposition of those of 2L and
4L CI3 whereas, for a relatively large twist angle (~ 5 degree), it mostly resembles that of isolated
2L CrI3. Remarkably, at an intermediate twist angle (~ 1.1 degree), its magnetism cannot be simply
inferred from the 2L and 4L cases, because it lacks sharp spin-flip transitions that are present
in 2L and 4L CrI3 and features a dramatic Raman circular dichroism that is absent in natural 2L and
4L ones. Our results demonstrate the possibility of designing and controlling the spin degree of
freedom in 2D magnets using twist engineering.

We investigate the Twisted Bilayer Graphene (TBG) model to obtain an analytic understanding of
its energetics and wavefunctions needed for many-body calculations. We provide an approximation
scheme which first elucidates why the BM $K_M$-point centered calculation containing only $4$
plane-waves provides a good analytical value for the first magic angle. The approximation scheme
also elucidates why most many-body matrix elements in the Coulomb Hamiltonian projected to the
active bands can be neglected. By applying our approximation scheme at the first magic angle to a
$\Gamma_M$-point centered model of 6 plane-waves, we analytically understand the small $\Gamma_M$-point
gap between the active and passive bands in the isotropic limit $w_0=w_1$. Furthermore, we analytically
calculate the group velocities of passive bands in the isotropic limit, and show that they are \emph{almost}
doubly degenerate, while no symmetry forces them to be. Furthermore, away from $\Gamma_M$ and $K_M$
points, we provide an explicit analytical perturbative understanding as to why the TBG bands are
flat at the first magic angle, despite it is defined only by vanishing $K_M$-point Dirac velocity.
We derive analytically a connected "magic manifold" $w_1=2\sqrt{1+w_0^2}-\sqrt{2+3w_0^2}$,
on which the bands remain extremely flat as $w_0$ is tuned between the isotropic ($w_0=w_1$) and
chiral ($w_0=0$) limits. We analytically show why going away from the isotropic limit by making
$w_0$ less (but not larger) than $w_1$ increases the $\Gamma_M$- point gap between active and passive
bands. Finally, perturbatively, we provide an analytic $\Gamma_M$ point $k\cdot p$ $2$-band model
that reproduces the TBG band structure and eigenstates in a certain $w_0,w_1$ parameter range.
Further refinement of this model suggests a possible faithful $2$-band $\Gamma_M$ point $k\cdot
p$ model in the full $w_0, w_1$ parameter range.

Constitutive models that describe the mechanical behavior of soft tissues have advanced greatly
over the past few decades. These expert models are generalizable and require the calibration of
a number of parameters to fit experimental data. However, inherent pitfalls stemming from the restriction
to a specific functional form include poor fits to the data, non-uniqueness of fit, and high sensitivity
to parameters. In this study we design and train fully connected neural networks as material models
to replace or augment expert models. To guarantee objectivity, the neural network takes isochoric
strain invariants as inputs, and outputs the value of strain energy and its derivatives with respect
to the invariants. Convexity of the material model is enforced through the loss function. Direct
prediction of the derivative functions -- rather than just predicting the energy -- serves two purposes:
it provides flexibility during training, and it enables the calculation of the elasticity tensor
through back-propagation. We showcase the ability of the neural network to learn the mechanical
behavior of porcine and murine skin from biaxial test data. Crucially, we show that a multi-fidelity
scheme which combines high fidelity experimental data with low fidelity analytical data yields
the best performance. The neural network material model can then be interpreted as the best extension
of an expert model: it learns the features that an expert has encoded in the analytical model while
fitting the experimental data better. Finally, we implemented a general user material subroutine
(UMAT) for the finite element software Abaqus and thereby make our advances available to the broader
computational community. We expect that the methods and software generated in this work will broaden
the use of data-driven constitutive models in biomedical applications.

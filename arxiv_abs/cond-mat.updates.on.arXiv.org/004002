Recent theoretical and computational progress has led to unprecedented understanding of symmetry-breaking
instabilities in 2D dynamic fracture. At the heart of this progress resides the identification
of two intrinsic, near crack tip length scales -- a nonlinear elastic length scale $\ell$ and a dissipation
length scale $\xi$ -- that do not exist in the classical theory of cracks. In particular, it has been
shown that at a high propagation velocity $v$, cracks in 2D brittle materials undergo an oscillatory
instability whose wavelength varies linearly with $\ell$, and at yet higher propagation velocities
and larger loading levels, a tip-splitting instability emerges, both in agreements with experiments.
In this paper, using phase-field models of brittle fracture, we demonstrate the following properties
of the oscillatory instability: (i) It exists also in the absence of near-tip elastic nonlinearity,
i.e. in the limit $\ell\!\to\!0$, with a wavelength determined by the dissipation length scale
$\xi$. This result shows that the instability crucially depends on the existence of an intrinsic
length scale associated with the breakdown of linear elasticity near crack tips, independently
of whether the latter is related to nonlinear elasticity or to dissipation. (ii) It is a supercritical
Hopf bifurcation, featuring a vanishing oscillations amplitude at onset. (iii) It is largely independent
of the fracture energy $\Gamma(v)$ that is controlled by a dissipation time scale. These results
substantiate the universal nature of the oscillatory instability of ultra-high speed cracks in
2D. In addition, we provide evidence indicating that the ultra-high velocity tip-splitting instability
is controlled by the limiting rate of elastic energy transport inside the crack tip region. Finally,
we describe in detail the numerical implementation scheme of the employed phase-field fracture
approach.

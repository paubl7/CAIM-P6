The relaxation dynamics of glass forming liquids and their structure are influenced in the vicinity
of confining walls. In view of the great potential of this effect for applications in those fields
of science and industry, where liquids occur under strong confinement (e.g., nano-technology),
the number of researchers studying various aspects and consequences of this non-monotonic behaviour
has been rapidly growing. This review aims at providing an overview of the research activity in this
newly emerging field. We first briefly discuss how competing mechanisms such as packing effects
and short-range attraction may lead to a non-monotonic glass transition scenario in the bulk. We
then analyse confinement effects on the dynamics of fluids using a thermodynamic route which relates
the single particle dynamics to the excess entropy. Moreover, relating the diffusive dynamics
to the Widom's insertion probability, the oscillations of the local dynamics with density at moderate
densities are fairly well described. At high densities belonging to the supercooled regime, however,
this approach breaks down signaling the onset of strongly collective effects. Indeed, confinement
introduces a new length scale which in the limit of high densities and small pore sizes competes with
the short-range local order of the fluid. This gives rise to a non-monotonic dependence of the packing
structure on confinement, with a corresponding effect on the dynamics of structural relaxation.
This non-monotonic effect occurs also in the case of a cone-plate type channel, where the degree
of confinement varies with distance from the apex. This is a very promising issue for future research
with the possibility of uncovering the existence of alternating glassy and liquid-like domains.

The predictability of any characteristic functional aspect in a double perovskite (DP) system
has always been compromised by its strong dependence over the inevitably present anti-site disorders
(ASD). Here, we aim to precisely map the qualitative and quantitative factors concerning ASD with
respect to the corresponding observables describing the magnetic and electronic state in epitaxial
Sm$_{2} $NiMnO$_{6} $ (SNMO) DP thin films. The concentration and distribution patterns of ASD
are effectively controlled by optimizing growth conditions and estimated on both local and global
scales utilizing extended X-ray absorption fine structure and bulk magnetometry. Depending upon
the mis-site defect densities, the nature of disorder distribution can vary from homogeneous to
partially segregated patches. The magnetic behavior of SNMO compromises between long range FM
ordering and short scale AFM interactions originated from ordered Ni-O-Mn and disordered Ni-O-Ni
or Mn-O-Mn bonds, respectively, which can be modified substantially by controlling B-site cation
arrangement. With increasing ASD, systematic shift in transition temperatures, drastic drop
in saturation moment along with deviation from uniaxial anisotropy behavior, reduction in anisotropy
energy and increase in defect dimension involving moment pinning efficiency are observed. However,
$ Ni^{2+}+Mn^{4+} \longrightarrow Ni^{3+}+Mn^{3+} $ charge fluctuation mediated signatures
of mixed valence characters are found to be independent of cation disorder densities. Inter competing
magnetic interactions from Sm vs Ni-Mn sublattice results in metastable magnetic ground state
with manifolds of uneven free energy landscape configurations. This work provides a route-map
to tailor the magnetic phase transitions, anisotropy behavior and magnetization reversal mechanism
by engineering the ASD fractions in a general DP system.

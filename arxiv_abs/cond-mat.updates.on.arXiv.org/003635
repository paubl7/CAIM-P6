Electronic excitations and ionisations produced by electron impact are key processes in the radiation-induced
damage mechanisms in materials of biological relevance, underlying important medical and technological
applications, including radiotherapy, radiation protection in manned space missions and nanodevice
fabrication techniques. However, experimentally measuring all the necessary electronic interaction
cross-sections for every relevant material is an arduous task, so it is necessary having predictive
models, sufficiently accurate yet easily implementable. In this work we present a model, based
on the dielectric formalism, to provide reliable ionisation and excitation cross-sections for
electron-impact on complex biomolecular media, taking into account their condensed-phase nature.
We account for the indistinguishability and exchange between the primary beam and excited electrons,
for the molecular electronic structure effects in the electron binding, as well as for higher-order
corrections to the first Born approximation. The resulting approach yields total ionisation cross-sections,
energy distributions of secondary electrons, and total electronic excitation cross-sections
for condensed-phase biomaterials, once the electronic excitation spectrum is known, either from
experiments or from a predictive model. The results of this methodology are compared with the available
experimental data in water and DNA/RNA molecular building blocks, showing a very good agreement
and a great predictive power in a wide range of electron incident energies, from the large values
characteristic of electron beams down to excitation threshold. The proposed model constitutes
a very useful procedure for computing the electronic interaction cross-sections for arbitrary
biological materials in a wide range of electron incident energies.

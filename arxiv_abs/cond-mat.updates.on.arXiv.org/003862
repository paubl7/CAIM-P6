The perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) at magnetic transition metal/oxide interfaces is
a key element in building out-of-plane magnetized magnetic tunnel junctions for spin-transfer-torque
magnetic random access memory (STT-MRAM). Size downscaling renders magnetic properties more
sensitive to thermal effects. Thus, understanding temperature dependence of magnetic anisotropy
becomes crucial. In this work, we theoretically address the correlation between temperature dependence
of PMA and magnetization in typical Fe/MgO-based structures. In particular, the possible mechanisms
behind experimentally reported deviations from the Callen and Callen scaling power law are analyzed.
First-principles calculations reveal small high-order anisotropy terms ruling out an intrinsic
microscopic mechanism underlying those deviations. Neglecting higher-order anisotropy terms
in the atomisitic spin Hamiltonian, two possible extrinsic macroscopic mechanisms are unveiled:
influence of the dead layer, always present in storage layer of STT-MRAM cells, and spatial inhomogeneities
of interfacial magnetic anisotropy. We show that presence of a dead layer simultaneously with scaling
the anisotropy constant by the total magnetization of the sample rather than that of the interface
itself lead to low scaling powers. In the second mechanism, increasing the percentage of inhomogeneity
in the interfacial PMA is revealed to decrease the scaling power. Apart from those different mechanisms,
the layer-resolved temperature-dependence of PMA is shown to ideally follow the Callen and Callen
scaling power law for each individual Fe layer. These results allow coherently explaining the difference
in scaling powers relating anisotropy and magnetization thermal variations reported in earlier
experiments. This is crucial for the understanding of the thermal stability of the storage layer
magnetization in STT-MRAM applications.

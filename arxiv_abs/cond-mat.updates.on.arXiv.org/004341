The study of topological magnetic excitations has attracted widespread attention in the past few
years. In this thesis, I have studied some examples of novel topological magnonic phases/phenomena
in low-dimensional quantum magnets. The first chapter motivates the research based on the research
gap in this field of study. The second chapter is written to make the thesis self-sufficient and the
concepts are explained through examples. In the second chapter, the following formalisms and physical
observables are described: Holstein-Primakoff, bond operator, Schwinger boson, Bogoliubov-Valatin,
Group theory, Berry-phase, Berry-curvature, Chern number, thermal Hall conductance, Nernst
conductivity, dynamical spin structure factor, edge-current. The main results of the thesis are
shown in the third, fourth, and fifth chapters. In the third chapter, I have shown that anti-chiral
edge states (co-propagating edge states) arise in the ferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the honeycomb
lattice with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interactions. My results suggest that such anti-chiral
edge states may be induced in certain realistic models of quantum magnets. In the fourth chapter,
I have found the emergence of many magnon band-topological phases in the flux state of the Shastry-Sutherland
model. I have derived a simple analytical form of the temperature dependence of derivative of thermal
Hall conductivity near the band topological transition point which I propose to be experimentally
useful. In the fifth chapter, I have investigated the emergence of Weyl triplons due to inter-layer
DM-interaction in a microscopic model of SrCu2(BO3)2, a widely studied frustrated quantum magnet.
I have shown that the thermal magnon Hall conductivity has a quasi-linear dependence as a function
of the magnetic field in a Weyl-triplon region.

Identifying what broken symmetries are present in the cuprates has become a major area of research.
Many authors have reported evidence for so-called "$Q \sim 0$" order that involves broken inversion,
mirror, chiral, or time-reversal symmetry that is uniform in space. Not all these observations
are well understood and new experimental probes are needed. Here we use resonant soft x-ray scattering
(RSXS) to search for $Q \sim 0$ order in Bi$_{2.1}$Sr$_{1.9}$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (Bi-2212) by measuring
the region of a forbidden Bragg peak, $(0,0,3)$, which is normally extinguished by symmetry but
may become allowed on resonance if valence band order is present. Using circularly polarized light,
we found that this reflection becomes allowed on the Cu $L_3$ resonance for temperatures $T_c < T
< T^\ast$, though remains absent in linear polarization and at other temperatures. This observation
suggests the existence of spatially uniform valence band order near the pseudogap temperature.
In addition, we observed periodic oscillations in the specular reflectivity from the sample surface
that resemble thin film interference fringes, though no known film is present. These fringes are
highly resonant, appear in all polarizations, and exhibit a period that depends on the location
where the beam strikes the sample surface. We speculate that these fringes arise from interaction
between some intrinsic valence band instability and extrinsic structural surface morphologies
of the material. Our study supports the existence of some kind of $Q \sim 0$ broken symmetry state
in Bi-2212 at intermediate temperatures, and calls for further study using a microfocused beam
that could disentangle microscopic effects from macroscopic heterogeneities.

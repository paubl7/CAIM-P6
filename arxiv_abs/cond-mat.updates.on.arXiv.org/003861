Although methylammonium lead iodide (CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$) perovskite has attracted enormous
scientific attention over the last decade or so, important information on the charge extraction
dynamics and recombination processes in perovskite devices is still missing. Herein we present
a novel approach to evaluate the quality of CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ layers, via in-situ monitoring
of the perovskite layer charge carrier dynamics during the thermal annealing crystallization
process, by means of time-resolved femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS). In particular,
CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$ films were deposited on two types of polymeric hole transport layers (HTL),
poly(3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene)-poly-(styrenesulfonate) (PEDOT:PSS) and poly-(triarylamine)
(PTAA), that are known to provide different carrier transport characteristics in perovskite solar
cells. In order to monitor the evolution of the perovskite charge carrier dynamics during the crystallization
process, the so-formed CH$_3$NH$_3$PbI$_3$/HTL architectures were studied in-situ by TAS at
three different annealing temperatures, i.e. 90, 100 and 110 oC. It is revealed that the annealing
time period required in order to achieve the optimum perovskite film quality in terms of the decay
dynamics strongly depends on the annealing temperature, as well as, on the employed HTL. For both
HTLs, the required period decreases as higher annealing temperature is used, while, for the more
hydrophobic PTAA polymer, longer annealing periods were required in order to obtain the optimum
charge carrier dynamics. The correlation of the TAS finding with the structural and morphological
features of the perovskite films is analysed and provides useful insights on the charge extraction
dynamics and recombination processes in perovskite optoelectronic devices.

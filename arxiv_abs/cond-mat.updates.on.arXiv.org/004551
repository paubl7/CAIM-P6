We examine the magnetic properties of the quasi 2D ferrimagnetic single crystal Mn3Si2Te6 (MST)
through critical phenomena and magnetic entropy analysis in the easy axis (H || ab) as a function
of proton irradiance. Employing a modified asymptotic analysis method, we find that upon proton
irradiation the critical exponents do not fall into any particular universality class but lie close
to mean field critical exponents ({\gamma} = 1, \b{eta} = 0.5). The presence of long-range interactions
can be safely assumed for the pristine and irradiated cases of MST examined in this work. Further
analysis on the effective spatial dimensionality reveal that MST remains at d = 3 under proton irradiation
transitioning from an n = 1 spin dimensionality to n = 2 and n=3 for 1 x 10^15 and 5 x 10^15 H+/cm^2, indicating
an XY interaction and a Heisenberg interaction, respectively. The pair (spin-spin) correlation
function reveals an increase in magnetic correlations at the proton irradiance of 5 x 10^15 H+/cm^2.
In conjunction, the maximum change in magnetic entropy obtained from isothermal magnetization
at 3 T is the largest for 5 x 10^15 H+/cm^2 with a value of 2.45 J/kgK at T = 73.66 K, in comparison to 1.60
J/kgK for pristine MST at T = 73 K. Magnetic entropy derived from zero-field heat capacity does not
show large deviations across the proton irradiated samples. This suggests that the antiferromagnetic
coupling between the Mn sites is stable even after proton irradiation. Such result implies that
magnetization is enhanced through a strengthening of the super-exchange interaction between
Mn atoms mediated through Te rather than a weakening of the AFM component. Overall, our study finds
that the magnetic interactions are manipulated the greatest when MST is irradiated at 5 x 10^15 H+/cm^2.

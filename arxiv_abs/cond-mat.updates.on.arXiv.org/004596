In the present work we demonstrate that C-doped Zr$_{5}$Pt$_{3}$ is an electron-phonon superconductor
(with critical temperature T$_\mathrm{C}$ = 3.7\,K) with a nonsymmorphic topological Dirac nodal-line
semimetal state, which we report here for the first time. The superconducting properties of Zr$_{5}$Pt$_{3}$C$_{0.5}$
have been investigated by means of magnetization and muon spin rotation and relaxation ($\mu$SR)
measurements. We find that at low temperatures the depolarization rate is almost constant and can
be well described by a single-band $s-$wave model with a superconducting gap of $2\Delta(0)/k_\mathrm{B}T_\mathrm{C}$
= 3.84, close to the value of BCS theory. From transverse field $\mu$SR analysis we estimate the London
penetration depth $\lambda_{L}$ = 469 nm, superconducting carrier density $n_{s}$ = 2$\times$10$^{26}$
$m^{-3}$, and effective mass m$^{*}$ = 1.584 $m_{e}$. Zero field $\mu$SR confirms the absence of
any spontaneous magnetic moment in the superconducting ground state. To gain additional insights
into the electronic ground state of C-doped Zr$_5$Pt$_3$, we have also performed first-principles
calculations within the framework of density functional theory (DFT). The observed homogenous
electronic character of the Fermi surface as well as the mutual decrease of $T_\mathrm{C}$ and density
of states at the Fermi level are consistent with the experimental findings. However, the band structure
reveals the presence of robust, gapless fourfold-degenarate nodal lines protected by $6_{3}$
screw rotations and glide mirror planes. Therefore, Zr$_5$Pt$_3$ represents a novel, unprecedented
condensed matter system to investigate the intricate interplay between superconductivity and
topology.

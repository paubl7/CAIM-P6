While the large paramagnetic response measured in certain ensembles of metallic nanoparticles
has been assigned to orbital effects of conduction electrons, the spin-orbit coupling has been
pointed out as a possible origin of the anomalously large diamagnetic response observed in other
cases. Such a relativistic effect, arising from the inhomogeneous electrostatic potential seen
by the conduction electrons, might originate from the host ionic lattice, impurities, or the self-consistent
confining potential. Here we theoretically investigate the effect of the spin-orbit coupling
arising from the confining potential, quantifying its contribution to the zero-field susceptibility
and gauging it against the ones generated by other weakly-relativistic corrections. Two ideal
geometries are considered in detail, the sphere and the half-sphere, focusing on the expected increased
role of the spin-orbit coupling upon a symmetry reduction, and the application of these results
to actual metallic nanoparticles is discussed. The matrix elements of the different weakly-relativistic
corrections are obtained and incorporated in a perturbative treatment of the magnetic field, leading
to tractable semi-analytical and semiclassical expressions for the case of the sphere, while a
numerical treatment becomes necessary for the half-sphere. The correction to the zero-field susceptibility
arising from the spin-orbit coupling in the sphere is quite small, and it is dominated by the weakly-relativistic
kinetic energy correction, which in turn remains considerably smaller than the typical values
of the nonrelativistic zero-field susceptibility. The symmetry reduction in going from the sphere
to the half-sphere does not translate into a significative increase of the spin-orbit contribution
to the zero-field susceptibility.

We investigate the Johari-Goldstein (JG) $\beta$-relaxation process in a model metallic glass-forming
(GF) material (Al90Sm10), previously studied extensively by both frequency-dependent mechanical
measurements and simulation studies devoted to equilibrium properties, by molecular dynamics
simulations based on validated and optimized interatomic potentials with the primary aim of better
understanding the nature of this universal relaxation process from a dynamic heterogeneity (DH)
perspective. The present relatively low temperature and long-time simulations reveal a direct
correspondence between the JG $\beta$-relaxation time $\tau_{JG}$ and the lifetime of the mobile
particle clusters $\tau_M$, defined as in previous DH studies, a relationship dual to the corresponding
previously observed relationship between the $\alpha$-relaxation time $\tau_\alpha$ and the
lifetime of immobile particle clusters $\tau_{IM}$. Moreover, we find that the average diffusion
coefficient D nearly coincides with D$_{Al}$, of the smaller atomic species (Al), and that the hopping
time associated with D coincides with $\tau_{JG}$ to within numerical uncertainty, both trends
being in accord with experimental studies indicating that the JG $\alpha$-relaxation is dominated
by the smaller atomic species and the observation of a direct relation between this relaxation process
and rate of molecular diffusion in GF materials at low temperatures where the JG $\beta$-relaxation
becomes the prevalent mode of structural relaxation. As an unanticipated aspect of our study, we
find that Al90Sm10 exhibits fragile-to-strong (FS) glass-formation, as found in measurements
of many other metallic GF liquids, but this fact does not greatly alter the nature of DH in this material
and the relation of DH to dynamical properties.

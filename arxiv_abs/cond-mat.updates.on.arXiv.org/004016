When two graphene sheets are twisted relative to each other by a small angle, enhanced correlations
lead to superconductivity whose origin remains under debate. Here, we derive some general constraints
on superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG), independent of its underlying mechanism.
Neglecting weak coupling between valleys, the global symmetry group of TBG consists of independent
spin rotations in each valley in addition to valley charge rotations, $ {\rm SU}(2) \times {\rm SU}(2)
\times {\rm U}_V(1) $. This symmetry is further enhanced to a full ${\rm SU}(4)$ in the idealized
chiral limit. In both cases, we show that any charge $2e$ pairing must break the global symmetry.
Additionally, if the pairing is unitary the resulting superconductor admits fractional vortices.
This leads to the following general statement: Any superconducting condensate in either symmetry
class has to satisfy one of three possibilities: (i) the superconducting pairing is non-unitary,
(ii) the superconducting condensate has charge $2e$ but admits at least half quantum vortices which
carry a flux of $h/4e$, or (iii) the superconducting condensate has charge $2me$, $m>1$, with vortices
carrying $h/2me$ flux. The latter possibility can be realized by a symmetric charge $4e$ superconductor
($m=2$). Non-unitary pairing (i) is expected in TBG for superconductors observed in the vicinity
of flavor polarized states. On the other hand, in the absence of flavor polarization, e.g. in the
vicinity of charge neutrality, one of the two exotic possibilities (ii) and (iii) is expected. We
sketch how all three scenarios can be realized in different limits within a strong coupling theory
of superconductivity based on skyrmions. Finally we discuss the effect of symmetry lowering anisotropies
and experimental implications of these scenarios.

Layered heterostructure materials with two different functional building blocks can teach us
about emergent physical properties and phenomena arising from interactions between the layers.
We report the intergrowth compounds KLa$M$$_{1-x}$Te$_{4}$ ($M$ = Mn, Zn; $x\approx$ 0.35) featuring
two chemically distinct alternating layers [LaTe$_3$] and [K$M$$_{1-x}$Te]. Their crystal structures
are incommensurate, determined by single X-ray diffraction for the Mn compound and transmission
electron microscope (TEM) study for the Zn compound. KLaMn$_{1-x}$Te$_{4}$ crystallizes in the
orthorhombic superspace group $Pmnm$(01/2${\gamma}$)$s$00 with lattice parameters $a$ = 4.4815(3)
{\AA}, $b$ = 21.6649(16) {\AA} and $c$ = 4.5220(3) {\AA}. It exhibits charge density wave (CDW) order
at room temperature with a modulation wave vector $\mathbf{q}$ = 1/2$\mathbf{b}$* + 0.3478$\mathbf{c}$*
originating from electronic instability of Te-square nets in [LaTe$_{3}$] layers. The Mn analog
exhibits a cluster spin glass behavior with spin freezing temperature $T_{\mathrm{f}}$ $\approx$
5 K attributed to disordered Mn vacancies and competing magnetic interactions in the [Mn$_{1-x}$Te]
layers. The Zn analog also has charge density wave order above room temperature with a similar $\mathbf{q}$-vector
having the $\mathbf{c}$* component ~ 0.346 confirmed by selected-area electron diffraction (SAED).
Electron transfer from [K$M_{1-x}$Te] to [LaTe$_{3}$] layers exists in KLa$M_{1-x}$Te$_{4}$,
leading to an enhanced electronic specific heat coefficient. The resistivities of KLa$M_{1-x}$Te$_{4}$
($M$ = Mn, Zn) exhibit metallic behavior at high temperatures and an upturn at low temperatures,
suggesting partial localization of carriers in the [LaTe$_{3}$] layers with some degree of disorder
associated with the $M$ atom vacancies in the [$M_{1-x}$Te] layers.

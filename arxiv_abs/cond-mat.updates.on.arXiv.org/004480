Monolayers of soft colloidal particles confined at fluid interfaces have been attracting increasing
interest for fundamental studies and applications alike. However, establishing the relation
between their internal architecture, which is controlled during synthesis, and their structural
and mechanical properties upon interfacial confinement, which define the monolayer's properties,
remains an elusive task. Here, we propose a comprehensive study elucidating this relation for a
system of microgels with tunable architecture. We synthesize core-shell microgels, whose soft
core can be chemically degraded in a controlled fashion, yielding particles ranging from analogues
of standard batch-synthesized to completely hollow microgels after total core removal. We characterize
the internal structure of these particles, their swelling properties in bulk and their morphologies
upon adsorption at an oil-water interface via a combination of numerical simulations and complementary
experiments. In particular, we confirm that hollow microgels are mechanically stable in bulk aqueous
conditions and that the progressive removal of the core leads to a significant flattening of the
microgels, which become disk-like particles, at the interface. At low compression, the mechanical
response of the monolayer is dominated by the presence of loosely crosslinked polymers forming
a corona surrounding the particle within the interfacial plane, regardless of the presence of a
core. By contrast, at high compression, the absence of a core enables the particles to deform in the
direction orthogonal to the interface. These findings shed new light on which structural features
of soft particles determine their interfacial behaviour, enabling new design strategies for tailored
materials.

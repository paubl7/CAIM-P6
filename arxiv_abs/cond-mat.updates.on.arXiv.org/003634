Due to studies in nonequilibrium (periodically-driven) topological matter, it is now understood
that some topological invariants used to classify equilibrium states of matter do not suffice to
describe their nonequilibrium counterparts. Indeed, in Floquet systems the additional gap arising
from the periodicity of the quasienergy Brillouin zone often leads to unique topological phenomena
without equilibrium analogues. In the context of Floquet Weyl semimetal, Weyl points may be induced
at both quasienergy zero and $\pi/T$ ($T$ being the driving period) and these two types of Weyl points
can be very close to each other in the momentum space. Because of their momentum-space proximity,
the chirality of each individual Weyl point may become hard to characterize in both theory and experiments,
thus making it challenging to determine the system's overall topology. In this work, inspired by
the construction of dynamical winding numbers in Floquet Chern insulators, we propose a dynamical
invariant capable of characterizing and distinguishing between Weyl points at different quasienergy
values, thus advancing one step further in the topological characterization of Floquet Weyl semimetals.
To demonstrate the usefulness of such a dynamical topological invariant, we consider a variant
of the periodically kicked Harper model (the very first model in studies of Floquet topological
phases) that exhibits many Weyl points, with the number of Weyl points rising unlimitedly with the
strength of some system parameters. Furthermore, we investigate the two-terminal transport signature
associated with the Weyl points. Theoretical findings of this work pave the way for experimentally
probing the rich topological band structures of some seemingly simple Floquet semimetal systems.

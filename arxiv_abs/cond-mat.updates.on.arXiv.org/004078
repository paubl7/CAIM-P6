Artificial Intelligence (AI) promises to fundamentally transform society; however, the realization
of this potential faces multiple challenges, as state-of-the-art AI is energy-intensive and lacks
the advanced cognitive capabilities of the brain. While spintronic neuromorphic computing can
enable ultra-low-power AI, cutting-edge devices have yet to realize many advanced neural properties.
Here, we design and simulate the dynamics of a self-adaptive spintronic neuron that incorporates
two advanced neuronal properties: neural oscillation and neuromodulation. The neuron utilizes
the oscillatory dynamics of five magnetic skyrmions hosted in a bilayer of thulium iron garnet (TmIG)
and platinum (Pt) and demonstrates four resonant modes that are identified as skyrmion gyration,
breathing, and their hybridizations. Both the amplitudes and frequencies of these modes can be
modified by reconfiguring the skyrmion lattice, enabling neuromodulation. Utilizing these advanced
neuronal dynamics, we demonstrate bio-plausible neuronal functions such as cross-frequency
coupling and bursting, and advanced cognitive processes such as context-awareness and feature
binding. Context awareness is implemented for a task in which a robot decides whether to open a box,
given a human spoken command and contextual information about the color of the box. Feature binding
is realized for a task where a neural network combines different segments of information regarding
the shape and color of an object, to construct a coherent percept of the perceived object. Context-awareness
and feature binding can fundamentally transform a wide array of fields including biomedicine,
neuro-prosthesis, human-machine interaction and manufacturing. These advanced cognitive abilities
provide a path for the next generation AI, one that understands and adapts to a complex and dynamic
environment and better collaborates with human beings.

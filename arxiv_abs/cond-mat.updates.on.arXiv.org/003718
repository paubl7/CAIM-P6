Crystal structure prediction (CSP) for inorganic materials is one of the central and most challenging
problems in materials science and computational chemistry. This problem can be formulated as a
global optimization problem in which global search algorithms such as genetic algorithms (GA)
and particle swarm optimization have been combined with first principle free energy calculations
to predict crystal structures given only a material composition or only a chemical system. These
DFT based ab initio CSP algorithms are computationally demanding and can only be used to predict
crystal structures of relatively small systems. The vast coordinate space plus the expensive DFT
free energy calculations limits their efficiency and effectiveness. On the other hand, a similar
structure prediction problem has been intensively investigated in parallel in the protein structure
prediction community of bioinformatics, in which the dominating predictors are knowledge based
approaches including homology modeling and threading that exploit known protein structures.
Herein we explore whether known geometric constraints such as the pairwise atomic distances of
a target crystal material can help predict/reconstruct its structure given its space group and
lattice information. We propose DMCrystal, a genetic algorithm based crystal structure reconstruction
algorithm based on predicted atomic pairwise distances. Based on extensive experiments, we show
that the predicted distance matrix can dramatically help to reconstruct the crystal structure
and usually achieves much better performance than CMCrystal, an atomic contact map based crystal
structure prediction algorithm. This implies that knowledge of atomic interaction information
learned from existing materials can be used to significantly improve the crystal structure prediction
in terms of both speed and quality.

Organic-inorganic hybrids may offer material properties not available from their inorganic components.
However, they are typically less stable and disordered. Long-term stability study of the hybrid
materials, over the anticipated lifespan of a real-world electronic device, is practically nonexistent.
Disordering, prevalent in most nanostructure assemblies, is a prominent adversary to quantum
coherence. A family of perfectly ordered II-VI based hybrid nanostructures has been shown to possess
a number of unusual properties and potential applications. Here, using a prototype structure ZnTe(en)0.5
- a hybrid superlattice, and applying an array of optical, structural, surface, thermal, and electrical
characterization techniques in conjunction with density-functional theory calculations, we
have performed a comprehensive and correlative study of the crystalline quality, structural degradation,
electronic, optical, and transport properties on samples from over 15-years old to the recently
synthesized. The findings show that not only do they exhibit an exceptionally high level of crystallinity
in both macroscopic and microscopic scale, comparable to high-quality binary semiconductors;
and greatly enhanced material properties, compared to those of the inorganic constituents; but
also, some of them over 15-years old remain as good in structure and property as freshly made ones.
This study reveals (1) what level of structural perfectness is achievable in a complex organic-inorganic
hybrid structure or a man-made superlattice, suggesting a non-traditional strategy to make periodically
stacked heterostructures with abrupt interfaces; and (2) how the stability of a hybrid material
is affected differently by its intrinsic attributes, primarily formation energy, and extrinsic
factors, such as surface and defects.

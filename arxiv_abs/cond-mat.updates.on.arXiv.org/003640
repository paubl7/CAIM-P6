Numerical simulations and finite-size scaling analysis have been carried out to study standard
and inverse percolation of straight rigid rods on triangular lattices. In the case of standard (inverse)
percolation, the lattice is initially empty(occupied) and linear $k$-mers ($k$ linear consecutive
sites) are randomly and sequentially deposited on(removed from) the lattice, considering an isotropic
and nematic scheme. The study is conducted by following the behavior of four critical concentrations
with the size $k$, determined for a wide range of $k$ : $(i)$[$(ii)$] standard isotropic[nematic]
percolation threshold $\theta_{c,k}$[$\vartheta_{c,k}$], and $(iii)$[$(iv)$] inverse isotropic[nematic]
percolation threshold $\theta^i_{c,k}$[$\vartheta^i_{c,k}$]. The obtained results indicate
that: $(1)$ $\theta_{c,k}$[$\theta^i_{c,k}$] exhibits a non-monotonous dependence with $k$.
It decreases[increases], goes through a minimum[maximum] around $k = 11$, then increases and asymptotically
converges towards a definite value for large $k$ $\theta_{c,k \rightarrow \infty}=0.500(2)$[$\theta^i_{c,k
\rightarrow \infty}=0.500(1)$]; $(2)$ $\vartheta_{c,k}$[$\vartheta^i_{c,k}$] rapidly increases[decreases]
and asymptotically converges towards a definite value for infinitely long $k$-mers $\vartheta_{c,k
\rightarrow \infty}=0.5334(6)$[$\vartheta^i_{c,k \rightarrow \infty}=0.4666(6)$]; $(3)$
for both models, the curves of standard and inverse percolation thresholds are symmetric with respect
to $\theta = 0.5$. Thus, a complementary property is found $\theta_{c,k} + \theta^i_{c,k} = 1$ (and
$\vartheta_{c,k} + \vartheta^i_{c,k} = 1$), which has not been observed in other regular lattices.
This condition is analytically validated by using exact enumeration of configurations for small
systems; and $(4)$ in all cases, the model presents percolation transition for the whole range of
$k$.

A complete set of all optical phonon modes predicted by symmetry for bixbyite structure indium oxide
is reported here from a combination of far-infrared and infrared spectroscopic ellipsometry,
as well as first principle calculations. Dielectric function spectra measured on high quality,
marginally electrically conductive melt grown single bulk crystals are obtained on a wavelength-by-wavelength
(a.k.a. point-by-point) basis and by numerical reduction of a subtle free charge carrier Drude
model contribution. A four-parameter semi-quantum model is applied to determine all sixteen pairs
of infrared-active transverse and longitudinal optical phonon modes, including the high-frequency
dielectric constant, $\varepsilon_{\infty}=4.05\pm 0.05$. The Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation
then gives access to the static dielectric constant, $\varepsilon_{\mathrm{DC}}=10.55\pm 0.07$.
All experimental results are in excellent agreement with our density functional theory calculations
and with previously reported values, where existent. We also perform optical Hall effect measurements
and determine for the unintentionally doped $n$-type sample a free electron density of $n=(2.81
\pm 0.01)\times 10^{17}$~cm$^{-3}$, mobility of $\mu=(112 \pm 3)$~cm$^{2}$/(Vs), and an effective
mass parameter of $(0.208\pm0.006)m_e$. Density and mobility parameters compare very well with
results of electrical Hall effect measurements. Our effective mass parameter, which is measured
independently of any other experimental technique, represents the bottom curvature of the $\Gamma$
point in In$_2$O$_3$ in agreement with previous extrapolations. We use terahertz spectroscopic
ellipsometry to measure the quasi-static response of In$_2$O$_3$, and our model validates the
static dielectric constant obtained from the Lyddane-Sachs-Teller relation.

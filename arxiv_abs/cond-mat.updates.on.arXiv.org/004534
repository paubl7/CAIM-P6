The ruthenium content of half-metallic Mn$_2$Ru$_x$Ga thin films, with a biaxially-strained
inverse Heusler structure, controls the ferrimagnetism that determines their magnetic and electronic
properties. An extensive study of Mn$_y$Ru$_x$Ga films on MgO (100) substrates with $1.8 \leq y
\leq 2.6$ and $x = 0.5$, 0.7 or 0.9, including crystallographic, magnetic order, magneto-transport
and spin polarisation is undertaken to map specific composition-dependent properties in this
versatile ternary system. A comparison of experimental densities obtained from X-ray reflectivity
with calculated densities for all alloys indicates full site occupancy, which implies chemical
disorder. All compositions lie on the Slater-Pauling plot with slope 1. All except $x = 0.5$, $y =
2.2$ exhibit magnetic compensation at \tcmp below 500~K, at which the coercivity may exceed 10~T.
Increasing the Mn or Ru content raises \tcmp, but increasing Ru also decreases the spin polarisation
determined by point contact Andreev reflection. Molecular field theory is used to model the temperature
dependence of the net ferrimagnetic moment and three principal exchange coefficients are deduced.
Marked differences in the shape of anomalous Hall and net magnetisation hysteresis loops are explained
by substantial canting of the small net moment by up to \SI{40}{\degree} relative to the $c$-axis
in zero field, which is a result of slight non-collinearity of the Mn$^{4c}$ sublattice moments
due to competing intra-sublattice exchange interactions arising from antisite disorder and excess
Mn in the unit cell. Consequences are reduced spin polarisation and an enhanced intrinsic contribution
to the anomalous Hall effect. The systematic investigation of the physical properties as a function
of $x$ and $y$ will guide the selection of compositions to meet the requirements for magnonic and
spintronic MRG-based devices.

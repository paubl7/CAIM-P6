An active colloidal fluid comprised of self-propelled spinning particles injecting energy and
angular momentum at the microscale demonstrates spontaneous collective states that range from
flocks to coherent vortices. Despite their seeming simplicity, the emergent far-from-equilibrium
behavior of these fluids remains poorly understood, presenting a challenge to the design and control
of next-generation active materials. When confined in a ring, such so-called polar active fluids
acquire chirality once the spontaneous flow chooses a direction. In a perfect ring, this chirality
is indefinitely long-lived. Here, we combine experiments on self-propelled colloidal Quincke
rollers and mesoscopic simulations of continuum Toner-Tu equations to explore how such chiral
states can be controlled and manipulated by obstacles. For different obstacle geometries three
dynamic steady states have been realized: long-lived chiral flow, an apolar state in which the flow
breaks up into counter-rotating vortices and an unconventional collective state with flow having
an oscillating chirality. The chirality reversal proceeds through the formation of intermittent
vortex chains in the vicinity of an obstacle. We demonstrate that the frequency of collective states
with oscillating chirality can be tuned by obstacle parameters. We vary obstacle shapes to design
chiral states that are independent of initial conditions. Building on our findings, we realize
a system with two triangular obstacles that force the active fluid towards a state with a density
imbalance of active particles across the ring. Our results demonstrate how spontaneous polar active
flows in combination with size and geometry of scatterers can be used to control dynamic patterns
of polar active liquids for materials design.

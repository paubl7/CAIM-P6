There has been a massive growth in the study of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) over the
past decade, based upon their interesting and unusual electronic, optical and mechanical properties,
such as tuneable and strain-dependent bandgaps. Tungsten disulfide (WS2), as a typical example
of TMDs, has considerable potential in applications such as strain engineered devices and the next
generation multifunctional polymer nanocomposites. However, controlling the strain, or more
practically, monitoring the strain in WS2 and the associated micromechanics have not been so well
studied. Both photoluminescence spectroscopy (PL) and Raman spectroscopy have been proved to
be effective but PL cannot be employed to characterise multilayer TMDs while it is difficult for
Raman spectroscopy to reveal the band structure. In this present study, photoluminescence and
Raman spectroscopy have been combined to monitor the strain distribution and stress transfer of
monolayer WS2 on a flexible polymer substrate and in polymer nanocomposites. It is demonstrated
that WS2 still follows continuum mechanics on the microscale and that strain generates a non-uniform
bandgap distribution even in a single WS2 flake through a simple strain engineering. It is shown
that these flakes could be useful in optoelectonic applications as they become micron-sized PL
emitters with a band gap that can be tuned by the application of external strain to the substrate.
The analysis of strain distributions using Raman spectroscopy is further extended to thin-film
few-layer WS2 polymer nanocomposites where it is demonstrated that the stress can be transferred
effectively to WS2 flakes. The relationship between the mechanical behaviour of single monolayer
WS2 flakes and that of few-layer flakes in bulk composites is investigated.

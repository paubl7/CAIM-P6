We have investigated the thermal-transport properties of the kagome antiferromagnet Cd-kapellasite
(Cd-K). We find that a field suppression effect on the longitudinal thermal conductivity k_xx sets
in below ~25 K, suggesting a large spin contribution k_xx^sp in k_xx. We also find clear thermal Hall
signals in the spin liquid phase in all Cd-K samples. The magnitude of the thermal Hall conductivity
k_xy shows a significant dependence on the sample's scattering time. On the other hand, the temperature
dependence of k_xy is similar in all Cd-K samples; k_xy shows a peak at almost the same temperature
of the peak of the phonon thermal conductivity k_xy^ph which is estimated by k_xx at 15 T. These results
indicate the presence of a dominant phonon thermal Hall k_xy^ph at 15 T. In addition to k_xy^ph, we
find that the field dependence of k_xy at low fields turns out to be non-linear at low temperatures,
concomitantly with the appearance of the field suppression of k_xx, indicating the presence of
a spin thermal Hall k_xy^sp at low fields. Remarkably, by assembling the k_xx dependene of k_xy^sp
data of other kagome antiferromagnets, we find that, whereas k_xy^sp stays a constant in the low-k_xx
region, k_xy^sp starts to increase as k_xx does in the high-k_xx region. This k_xx dependence of
k_xy^sp indicates the presence of both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms in the spin thermal Hall
effect in kagome antiferromagnets. Furthermore, both k_xy^ph and k_xy^sp disappear in the antiferromagnetic
ordered phase at low fields, showing that phonons alone do not exhibit the thermal Hall effect. A
high field above ~7 T induces k_xy^ph, concomitantly with a field-induced increase of k_xx and the
specific heat, suggesting a coupling of the phonons to the field-induced spin excitations as the
origin of k_xy^ph.

The modern description of elementary particles, as formulated in the Standard Model of particle
physics, is built on gauge theories. Gauge theories implement fundamental laws of physics by local
symmetry constraints. For example, in quantum electrodynamics, Gauss's law introduces an intrinsic
local relation between charged matter and electromagnetic fields, which protects many salient
physical properties including massless photons and a long-ranged Coulomb law. Solving gauge theories
by classical computers is an extremely arduous task, which has stimulated a vigorous effort to simulate
gauge-theory dynamics in microscopically engineered quantum devices. Previous achievements
implemented density-dependent Peierls phases without defining a local symmetry, realized mappings
onto effective models to integrate out either matter or electric fields, or were limited to very
small systems. The essential gauge symmetry has not been observed experimentally. Here, we report
the quantum simulation of an extended U(1) lattice gauge theory, and experimentally quantify the
gauge invariance in a many-body system comprising matter and gauge fields. These are realized in
defect-free arrays of bosonic atoms in an optical superlattice of 71 sites. We demonstrate full
tunability of the model parameters and benchmark the matter--gauge interactions by sweeping across
a quantum phase transition. Enabled by high-fidelity manipulation techniques, we measure the
degree to which Gauss's law is violated by extracting probabilities of locally gauge-invariant
states from correlated atom occupations. Our work provides a way to explore gauge symmetry in the
interplay of fundamental particles using controllable large-scale quantum simulators.

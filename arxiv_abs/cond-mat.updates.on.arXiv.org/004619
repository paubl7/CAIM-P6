The geometry and topology of the region in which a director field is embedded impose limitations
on the kind of supported orientational order. These limitations manifest as compatibility conditions
that relate the quantities describing the director field to the geometry of the embedding space.
For example, in two dimensions (2D) the splay and bend fields suffice to determine a director uniquely
(up to rigid motions) and must comply with one relation linear in the Gaussian curvature of the embedding
manifold. In 3D there are additional local fields describing the director, i.e. fields available
to a local observer residing within the material, and a number of distinct ways to yield geometric
frustration. So far it was unknown how many such local fields are required to uniquely describe a
3D director field, nor what are the compatibility relations they must satisfy. In this work, we address
these questions directly. We employ the method of moving frames to show that a director field is fully
determined by five local fields. These fields are shown to be related to each other and to the curvature
of the embedding space through six differential relations. As an application of our method, we characterize
all uniform distortion director fields, i.e., directors for which all the local characterizing
fields are constant in space, in manifolds of constant curvature. The classification of such phases
has been recently provided for directors in Euclidean space, where the textures correspond to foliations
of space by parallel congruent helices. For non-vanishing curvature, we show that the pure twist
phase is the only solution in positively curved space, while in the hyperbolic space uniform distortion
fields correspond to foliations of space by (non-necessarily parallel) congruent helices. Further
analysis is expected to allow to also construct of new non-uniform director fields.

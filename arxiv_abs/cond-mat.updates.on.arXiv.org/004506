Second harmonic generation (SHG) spectroscopy ubiquitously enables the investigation of surface
chemistry, interfacial chemistry as well as symmetry properties in solids. Polarization-resolved
SHG spectroscopy in the visible to infrared regime is regularly used to investigate electronic
and magnetic orders through their angular anisotropies within the crystal structure. However,
the increasing complexity of novel materials and emerging phenomena hamper the interpretation
of experiments solely based on the investigation of hybridized valence states. Here, polarization-resolved
SHG in the extreme ultraviolet (XUV-SHG) is demonstrated for the first time, enabling element-resolved
angular anisotropy investigations. In non-centrosymmetric LiNbO$_3$, elemental contributions
by lithium and niobium are clearly distinguished by energy dependent XUV-SHG measurements. This
element-resolved and symmetry-sensitive experiment suggests that the displacement of Li ions
in LiNbO$_3$, which is known to lead to ferroelectricity, is accompanied by distortions to the Nb
ion environment that breaks the inversion symmetry of the NbO$_{6}$ octahedron as well. Our simulations
show that the measured second harmonic spectrum is consistent with Li ion displacements from the
centrosymmetric position by $\sim$0.5 Angstrom while the Nb-O bonds are elongated/contracted
by displacements of the O atoms by $\sim$0.1 Angstrom. In addition, the polarization-resolved
measurement of XUV-SHG shows excellent agreement with numerical predictions based on dipole-induced
SHG commonly used in the optical wavelengths. This constitutes the first verification of the dipole-based
SHG model in the XUV regime. The findings of this work pave the way for future angle and time-resolved
XUV-SHG studies with elemental specificity in condensed matter systems.

We study the dynamical polarization function and plasmon modes for spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric
metals (NCMs). These systems have different Fermi surface topology for Fermi energies above and
below the spin degenerate point which is also known as the band touching point (BTP). We calculate
the exact dynamical polarization function numerically and also provide its analytical expression
in the long wavelength limit. We obtain the plasmon dispersion within the framework of random phase
approximation. In NCMs, there is a finite energy gap in between intra and interband particle hole
continuum (PHC) for vanishing excitation wavevector. In the long wavelength limit, the width of
interband PHC behaves differently for Fermi energies below and above the BTP as a clear signature
of the Fermi surface topology change. We find a single undamped optical plasmon mode lying in between
the intra and interband PHC for Fermi energies above and below the BTP. The plasmon mode below the
BTP has smaller velocity than that of above the BTP. It is interesting to find that as we tune the Fermi
energy around the BTP, the plasmon mode becomes damped within a range of e-e interaction strength.
For Fermi energies above and below the BTP, we also obtain an approximate analytical result of plasma
frequency and plasmon dispersion which match well with their numerical counterparts in the long
wavelength limit. The plasmon dispersion is $\propto q^2$ with $q$ being the wave vector for plasmon
excitation in the long wavelength limit. We find that varying the carrier density with fixed e-e
interaction strength or vice versa does not change the number of undamped plasmon mode, although
damped plasmon modes can be more in number for some values of these parameters. We demonstrate our
results by calculating the loss function and optical conductivity which can be measured in experiments.

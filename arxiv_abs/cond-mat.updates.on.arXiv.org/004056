Chiral anomaly or Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly in Weyl semimetals (WSMs) has a significant impact
on the electron transport behaviors, leading to remarkable longitudinal or planar electrical
and thermoelectric transport phenomena in the presence of electromagnetic gauge fields. These
phenomena are consequences of the imbalanced chiral charge and energy induced by chiral anomaly
in the presence of parallel electric ($\mathbf{E}$) and magnetic ($\mathbf{B}$) fields ($\mathbf{E
\cdot B }\neq 0$) or $(\mathbf{B \cdot \nabla }T\neq 0)$ ($\mathbf{\nabla}T$ is the thermal gradient).
We here propose another two fascinating transport properties, namely, the nonlinear planar Nernst
effect and nonlinear planar thermal Hall effect induced by chiral anomaly in the presence of $\mathbf{B
\cdot \nabla}T\neq 0$ in WSMs. Using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory, we derive the
analytical expressions for the chiral anomaly induced nonlinear Nernst and thermal Hall transport
coefficients and also evaluate the fundamental mathematical relations among them in the nonlinear
regime. The formulas we find in this current work are consistent with that predicted for the nonlinear
anomalous electrical and thermoelectric effects induced by Berry curvature dipole recently.
Additionally, in contrast to the recent work, by utilizing the lattice Weyl Hamiltonian with intrinsic
chiral chemical potential, we find that the chiral anomaly induced nonlinear planar effects can
exist even for a pair of oppositely tilted or non-tilted Weyl cones in both time reversal and inversion
broken WSMs. The chiral anomaly induced nonlinear planar effects predicted here along with the
related parameter dependencies are hence possible to be realized in realistic WSMs in experiment.

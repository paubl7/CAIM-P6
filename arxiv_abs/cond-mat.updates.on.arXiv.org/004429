The surface topography of diamond coatings strongly affects surface properties such as adhesion,
friction, wear, and biocompatibility. However, the understanding of multi-scale topography,
and its effect on properties, has been hindered by conventional measurement methods, which capture
only a single length scale. Here, four different polycrystalline diamond coatings are characterized
using transmission electron microscopy to assess the roughness down to the sub-nanometer scale.
Then these measurements are combined, using the power spectral density (PSD), with conventional
methods (stylus profilometry and atomic force microscopy) to characterize all scales of topography.
The results demonstrate the critical importance of measuring topography across all length scales,
especially because their PSDs cross over one another, such that a surface that is rougher at a larger
scale may be smoother at a smaller scale and vice versa. Furthermore, these measurements reveal
the connection between multi-scale topography and grain size, with characteristic scaling behavior
at and slightly below the mean grain size, and self-affine fractal-like roughness at other length
scales. At small (subgrain) scales, unpolished surfaces exhibit a common form of residual roughness
that is self-affine in nature but difficult to detect with conventional methods. This approach
of capturing topography from the atomic- to the macro-scale is termed comprehensive topography
characterization, and all of the topography data from these surfaces has been made available for
further analysis by experimentalists and theoreticians. Scientifically, this investigation
has identified four characteristic regions of topography scaling in polycrystalline diamond
materials.

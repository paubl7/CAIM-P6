Recently, two multifold fermions materials, AlPt[arXiv:1812.03310] and XSi(X=Rh,Co)[arXiv:1812.04466][arXiv:1901.03358][arXiv:1809.01312],
characterized by multifold degeneracy band crossings at time-reversal invariant momenta (TRIMs)
have been discovered in chiral crystals experimentally. In this work, we largely expand the family
of multifold fermions by pointing out that several well-studied noncentrosymmetric superconductors
are indeed multifold fermion metals. Importantly, their normal state topological properties,
which have been ignored in previous studies, play an important role in the superconducting properties.
Taking Li$_2$Pd$_3$B and Li$_2$Pt$_3$B as examples, we found a large number of unconventional
degenerate point, such as double spin-1, spin-3/2, Weyl and double Weyl topological band crossing
points near the Fermi energy, which result in finite Chern numbers on Fermi surfaces. Long Fermi
arc states in Li$_2$Pd$_3$B, originating from the nontrivial band topology were found. Importantly,
it has been shown experimentally that Li$_2$Pd$_3$B and Li$_2$Pt$_3$B are fully gapped and gapless
superconductors respectively. By analyzing the possible pairing symmetries, we suggest that
Li$_2$Pd$_3$B can be a DIII class topological superconductor with Majorana surface states, even
if the spin-orbit coupling in Li$_2$Pd$_3$B is negligible. Interestingly, Li$_2$Pt$_3$B, being
gapless, is likely to be a nodal topological superconductor with dispersion-less surface Majorana
modes. We further identified that several noncentrosymmetric superconductors, such as Mo$_3$Al$_2$C,
PdBiSe, Y$_2$C$_3$ and La$_2$C$_3$, are multifold fermion superconductors whose normal state
topological properties have been ignored in previous experimental and theoretical studies.

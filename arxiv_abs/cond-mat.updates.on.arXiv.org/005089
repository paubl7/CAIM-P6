Perpendicular magnetization is essential for high-density memory application using magnetic
materials. High-spin polarization of conduction electrons is also required for realizing large
electric signals from spin-dependent transport phenomena. Heusler alloy is a well-known material
class showing the half-metallic electronic structure. However, its cubic lattice nature favors
in-plane magnetization and thus minimizes the perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), in general.
This study focuses on an inverse-type Heusler alloy, Mn$_{2-\delta}$CoGa$_{1+\delta}$ (MCG)
with a small off-stoichiometry ($\delta$) , which is expected to be a half-metallic material. We
observed relatively large uniaxial magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy ($K_\mathrm{u}$)
of the order of 10$^5$ J/m$^3$ at room temperature in MCG films with a small tetragonal distortion
of a few percent. A positive correlation was confirmed between the $c/a$ ratio of lattice constants
and $K_\mathrm{u}$. Imaging of magnetic domains using Kerr microscopy clearly demonstrated a
change in the domain patterns along with $K_\mathrm{u}$. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD)
was employed using synchrotron radiation soft x-ray beam to get insight into the origin for PMA.
Negligible angular variation of orbital magnetic moment ($\Delta m_\mathrm{orb}$) evaluated
using the XMCD spectra suggested a minor role of the so-called Bruno's term to $K_\mathrm{u}$. Our
first principles calculation reasonably explained the small $\Delta m_\mathrm{orb}$ and the
positive correlation between the $c/a$ ratio and $K_\mathrm{u}$. The origin of the magnetocrystalline
anisotropy was discussed based on the second-order perturbation theory in terms of the spin-orbit
coupling, claiming that the mixing of the occupied $\uparrow$- and the unoccupied $\downarrow$-spin
states is responsible for the PMA of the MCG films.

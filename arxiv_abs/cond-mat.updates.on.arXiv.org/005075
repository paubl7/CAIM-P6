Motivated by recent attempts to quantum simulate lattice models with continuous Abelian symmetries
using discrete approximations, we define an extended-O(2) model by adding a $\gamma \cos(q\varphi)$
term to the ordinary O(2) model with angular values restricted to a $2\pi$ interval. In the $\gamma
\rightarrow \infty$ limit, the model becomes an extended $q$-state clock model that reduces to
the ordinary $q$-state clock model when $q$ is an integer and otherwise is a continuation of the clock
model for noninteger $q$. By shifting the $2\pi$ integration interval, the number of angles selected
can change discontinuously and two cases need to be considered. What we call case $1$ has one more
angle than what we call case $2$. We investigate this class of clock models in two space-time dimensions
using Monte Carlo and tensor renormalization group methods. Both the specific heat and the magnetic
susceptibility show a double-peak structure for fractional $q$. In case $1$, the small-$\beta$
peak is associated with a crossover, and the large-$\beta$ peak is associated with an Ising critical
point, while both peaks are crossovers in case $2$. When $q$ is close to an integer by an amount $\Delta
q$ and the system is close to the small-$\beta$ Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition,
the system has a magnetic susceptibility that scales as $\sim 1 / (\Delta q)^{1 - 1/\delta'}$ with
$\delta'$ estimates consistent with the magnetic critical exponent $\delta = 15$. The crossover
peak and the Ising critical point move to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition points
with the same power-law scaling. A phase diagram for this model in the $(\beta, q)$ plane is sketched.
These results are possibly relevant for configurable Rydberg-atom arrays where the interpolations
among phases with discrete symmetries can be achieved by varying continuously the distances among
atoms and the detuning frequency.

Here we report on detailed studies of the magnetic properties of the wurtzite (Ga,Mn)As cylindrical
shells. Ga$_{0.94}$Mn$_{0.06}$As shells have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy at low temperature
as a part of multishell cylinders overgrown on wurtzite (Ga,In)As nanowires cores, synthesized
on GaAs (111)B substrates. Our studies clearly indicate the presence of a low temperature ferromagnetic
coupling, which despite a reasonably high Mn contents of 6\% is limited only to below 30~K. A set of
dedicated measurements shows that despite a high structural quality of the material the magnetic
order has a granular form, which gives rise to the dynamical slow-down characteristic to blocked
superparamagnets. The lack of the long range order has been assigned to a very low hole density, caused
primarily by numerous compensation donors, arsenic antisites, formed in the material due to a specific
geometry of the growth of the shells on the nanowire template. The associated electrostatic disorder
has formed a patchwork of spontaneously magnetized (macrospin) and nonmagnetic (paramagnetic)
volumes in the material. Using high field results it has been evaluated that the total volume taken
by the macrospins constitute about 2/3 of the volume of the (Ga,Mn)As whereas in the remaining 1/3
only paramagnetic Mn ions reside. By establishing the number of the uncoupled ions the two contributions
were separated. The Arrott plot method applied to the superparamagnetic part yielded the first
experimental assessment of the magnitude of the spin-spin coupling temperature within the macrospins
in (Ga,Mn)As, $T_{\mathrm{C}}=28$~K. In a broader view our results constitute an important contribution
to the still ongoing dispute on the true and the dominant form(s) of the magnetism in this model dilute
ferromagnetic semiconductor.

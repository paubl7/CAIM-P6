Ternary perovskites have long featured prominently in solid-state chemistry and in condensed
matter physics, but the joint understanding of their two main subgroups -- halides and oxides --
has not been fully developed. Indeed, unlike the case in simpler compounds having a single, robust,
repeated bonding motif, certain cubic perovskite can manifest a non-thermal distribution of local
motifs, such as positional degrees of freedom. Unlike thermal motion, such static distortions
do not time-average to zero. The present study compares electronic structure features of oxide
and halide perovskites starting from the static motif distribution described by DFT minimization
of the T=0 internal energy, continuing to finite temperature thermal disorder modeled via finite
temperature DFT MD simulations. We find that (i) Different oxide vs halide compounds adopt different
energy lowering symmetry breaking modes. The calculated pair distribution function of SrTiO$_3$
agrees with recently measured PDF; (ii) In both oxides and halides, such static distortions lead
to band gap blueshifts with respect to undistorted cubic Pm-3m structure (iii) For ABO$_3$ perovskites,
thermal-induced distortions revealed by AIMD simulation can lead to a band gap redshift. (iv) In
contrast, for cubic halide perovskite CsPbI$_3$, both the intrinsic distortions and the thermal
distortions contribute in tandem to band gap blueshift, the former, intrinsic effect being dominant.
(v) In the oxide SrTiO$_3$ and CaTiO$_3$, (but not in halide) perovskites octahedral tilting leads
to the emergence of a distinct $\Gamma$-$\Gamma$ direct band gap component as a secondary valley
minimum to the well-known indirect R-$\Gamma$ gap. The understanding of such static vs thermal
effects on oxide vs halide perovskites holds the potential for designing target electronic properties.

Long-distance transfer of quantum information in architectures based on quantum dot spin qubits
will be necessary for their scalability. One way of achieving it is to simply move the electron between
two quantum registers. Precise control over the electron shuttling through a chain of tunnel-coupled
quantum dots is possible when interdot energy detunings are changed adiabatically. Deterministic
character of shuttling is however endangered by coupling of the transferred electron to thermal
reservoirs: sources of fluctuations of electric fields, and lattice vibrations. We theoretically
analyse how the electron transfer between two quantum dots is affected by electron-phonon scattering,
and interaction with sources of $1/f$ and Johnson charge noise in both detuning and tunnel coupling.
The electron-phonon scattering turns out to be irrelevant in Si quantum dots, while a competition
between the effects of charge noise and Landau-Zener effect leads to an existence of optimal detuning
sweep rate, at which probability of leaving the electron behind is minimal. In GaAs quantum dots,
on the other hand, coupling to phonons is strong enough to make the phonon-assisted processes of
interdot transfer dominate over influence of charge noise. The probability of leaving the electron
behind depends then monotonically on detuning sweep rate, and values much smaller than in silicon
can be obtained for slow sweeps. However, after taking into account limitations on transfer time
imposed by need for preservation of electron's spin coherence, minimal probabilities of leaving
the electron behind in both GaAs- and Si-based double quantum dots turn out to be of the same order
of magnitude. Bringing them down below $10^{-3}$ requires temperatures $\leq \! 100$ mK and tunnel
couplings above $20$ $\mu$eV.

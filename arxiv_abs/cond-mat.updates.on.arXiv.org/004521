Three-dimensional topological insulators (TIs) host helical Dirac surface states at the interface
with a trivial insulator. In quasi-one-dimensional TI nanoribbon structures the wave function
of surface charges extends phase-coherently along the perimeter of the nanoribbon, resulting
in a quantization of transverse surface modes. Furthermore, as the inherent spin-momentum locking
results in a Berry phase offset of $\pi$ of self-interfering charge carriers an energy gap within
the surface state dispersion appears and all states become spin-degenerate. We investigate and
compare the magnetic field dependent surface state dispersion in selectively deposited Bi$_2$Te$_3$
TI micro- and nanoribbon structures by analysing the gate voltage dependent magnetoconductance
at cryogenic temperatures. Hall measurements on microribbon field effect devices show a high bulk
charge carrier concentration and electrostatic simulations show an inhomogeneous gate potential
profile on the perimeter of the TI ribbon. In nanoribbon devices we identify a magnetic field dependency
of the surface state dispersion as it changes the occupation of transverse subbands close to the
Fermi energy. We quantify the energetic spacing in between these subbands by measuring the conductance
as a function of the applied gate potential and use an electrostatic model that treats the inhomogeneous
gate profile and the initial charge carrier densities on the top and bottom surface. In the gate voltage
dependent transconductance we find oscillations that change their relative phase by $\pi$ at half-integer
values of the magnetic flux quantum applied coaxial to the nanoribbon providing evidence for a magnetic
flux dependent topological phase transition in narrow, selectively deposited TI nanoribbon devices.

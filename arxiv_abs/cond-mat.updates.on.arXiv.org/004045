Structural glasses feature quasilocalized excitations whose frequencies $\omega$ follow a universal
density of states ${\cal D}(\omega)\!\sim\!\omega^4$. Yet, the underlying physics behind this
universality is not fully understood. Here we study a mean-field model of quasilocalized excitations
in glasses, viewed as groups of particles embedded inside an elastic medium and described collectively
as anharmonic oscillators. The oscillators, whose harmonic stiffness is taken from a rather featureless
probability distribution (of upper cutoff $\kappa_0$) in the absence of interactions, interact
among themselves through random couplings (characterized by strength $J$) and with the surrounding
elastic medium (an interaction characterized by a constant force $h$). We first show that the model
gives rise to a gapless density of states ${\cal D}(\omega)\!=\!A_{\rm g}\,\omega^4$ for a broad
range of model parameters, expressed in terms of the strength of stabilizing anharmonicity, which
plays a decisive role in the model. Then -- using scaling theory and numerical simulations -- we provide
a complete understanding of the non-universal prefactor $A_{\rm g}(h,J,\kappa_0)$, of the oscillators'
interaction-induced mean square displacement and of an emerging characteristic frequency, all
in terms of properly identified dimensionless quantities. In particular, we show that $A_{\rm
g}(h,J,\kappa_0)$ is a nonmonotonic function of $J$ for a fixed $h$, varying predominantly exponentially
with $-(\kappa_0 h^{2/3}\!/J^2)$ in the weak interactions (small $J$) regime -- reminiscent of
recent observations in computer glasses -- and predominantly decaying as a power-law for larger
$J$, in a regime where $h$ plays no role. We discuss the physical interpretation of the model and its
possible relations to available observations in structural glasses, along with delineating some
future research directions.

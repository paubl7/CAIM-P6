The fundamental ideas for a non-local density functional theory -- capable of reliably capturing
van der Waals interaction -- were already conceived in the 1990's. In 2004, a seminal paper introduced
the first practical non-local exchange-correlation functional called vdW-DF, which has become
widely successful and laid the foundation for much further research. However, since then, the functional
form of vdW-DF has remained unchanged. Several successful modifications paired the original functional
with different (local) exchange functionals to improve performance and the successor vdW-DF2
also updated one internal parameter. Bringing together different insights from almost two decades
of development and testing, we present the next-generation non-local correlation functional
called vdW-DF3, in which we change the functional form while staying true to the original design
philosophy. Although many popular functionals show good performance around the binding separation
of van der Waals complexes, they often result in significant errors at larger separations. With
vdW-DF3, we address this problem by taking advantage of a recently uncovered and largely unconstrained
degree of freedom within the vdW-DF framework that can be constrained through empirical input,
making our functional semi-empirical. For two different parameterizations, we benchmark vdW-DF3
against a large set of well-studied test cases and compare our results with the most popular functionals,
finding good performance in general for a wide array of systems and a significant improvement in
accuracy at larger separations. Finally, we discuss the achievable performance within the current
vdW-DF framework, the flexibility in functional design offered by vdW-DF3, as well as possible
future directions for non-local van der Waals density functional theory.

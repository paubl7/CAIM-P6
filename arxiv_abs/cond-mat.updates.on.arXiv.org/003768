Networks of flexible filaments often involve regions of tight contact. Predictively understanding
the equilibrium configurations of these systems is challenging due to intricate couplings between
topology, geometry, large nonlinear deformations, and friction. Here, we perform an in-depth
study of a simple yet canonical problem that captures the essence of contact between filaments.
In the orthogonal clasp, two filaments are brought into contact, with each centerline lying in one
of a pair of orthogonal planes. Our data from X-ray tomography (micro-CT) and mechanical testing
experiments are in excellent agreement with the finite element method (FEM) simulations. Despite
the apparent simplicity of the physical system, the data exhibits strikingly unintuitive behavior,
even when the contact is frictionless. Specifically, we observe a curvilinear diamond-shaped
ridge in the contact pressure field between the two filaments, sometimes with an inner gap. When
a relative displacement is imposed between the filaments, friction is activated, and a highly asymmetric
pressure field develops. These findings contrast to the classic capstan analysis of a single filament
wrapped around a rigid body. Both the micro-CT and the FEM data indicate that the cross-sections
of the filaments can deform significantly. Nonetheless, an idealized geometrical theory assuming
undeformable tube cross-sections and neglecting elasticity rationalizes our observations qualitatively
and highlights the central role of the small but finite tube radius of the filaments. We believe that
our orthogonal clasp analysis provides a building block for future modeling efforts in frictional
contact mechanics of more complex filamentary structures.

Efficient quantum state measurement is important for maximizing the extracted information from
a quantum system. For multi-qubit quantum processors in particular, the development of a scalable
architecture for rapid and high-fidelity readout remains a critical unresolved problem. Here
we propose reservoir computing as a resource-efficient solution to quantum measurement of superconducting
multi-qubit systems. We consider a small network of Josephson parametric oscillators, which can
be implemented with minimal device overhead and in the same platform as the measured quantum system.
We theoretically analyze the operation of this Kerr network as a reservoir computer to classify
stochastic time-dependent signals subject to quantum statistical features. We apply this reservoir
computer to the task of multinomial classification of measurement trajectories from joint multi-qubit
readout. For a two-qubit dispersive measurement under realistic conditions we demonstrate a classification
fidelity reliably exceeding that of an optimal linear filter using only two to five reservoir nodes,
while simultaneously requiring far less calibration data \textendash{} as little as a single measurement
per state. We understand this remarkable performance through an analysis of the network dynamics
and develop an intuitive picture of reservoir processing generally. Finally, we demonstrate how
to operate this device to perform two-qubit state tomography and continuous parity monitoring
with equal effectiveness and ease of calibration. This reservoir processor avoids computationally
intensive training common to other deep learning frameworks and can be implemented as an integrated
cryogenic superconducting device for low-latency processing of quantum signals on the computational
edge.

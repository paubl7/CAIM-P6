Polar chiral structures have recently attracted much interest within the scientific community,
as they pave the way towards innovative device concepts similar to the developments achieved in
nanomagnetism. Despite the growing interest, many fundamental questions related to the mechanisms
controlling the appearance and stability of ferroelectric topological structures remain open.
In this context, ferroelectric nanoparticles provide a flexible playground for such investigations.
Here, we present a theoretical study of ferroelectric polar textures in a cylindrical core-shell
nanoparticle. The calculations reveal a chiral polarization structure containing two oppositely
oriented diffuse axial domains located near the cylinder ends, separated by a region with a zero-axial
polarization. We name this polarization configuration "flexon" to underline the flexoelectric
nature of its axial polarization. Analytical calculations and numerical simulation results show
that the flexon's chirality can be switched by reversing the sign of the flexoelectric coefficient.
Furthermore, the anisotropy of the flexoelectric coupling is found to critically influence the
polarization texture and domain morphology. The flexon rounded shape, combined with its distinct
chiral properties and the localization nature near the surface, are reminiscent of Chiral Bobber
structures in magnetism. In the azimuthal plane, the flexon displays the polarization state of
a vortex with an axially polarized core region, i.e., a meron. The flexoelectric effect, which couples
the electric polarization and elastic strain gradients, plays a determining role in the stabilization
of these chiral states. We discuss similarities between this interaction and the recently predicted
ferroelectric Dyzaloshinskii-Moriya interaction leading to chiral polarization states.

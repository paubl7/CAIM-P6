We use mesoscale numerical simulations to investigate the unsteady dynamics of a single red blood
cell (RBC) subjected to an external mechanical load. We carry out a detailed comparison between
the {\it loading} (L) dynamics, following the imposition of the mechanical load on the RBC at rest,
and the {\it relaxation} (R) dynamics, allowing the RBC to relax to its original shape after the sudden
arrest of the mechanical load. Such a comparison is carried out by analyzing the characteristic
times of the two corresponding dynamics, i.e., $t_L$ and $t_R$. When the intensity of the mechanical
load is small enough, the two kinds of dynamics are {\it symmetrical} ($t_L \approx t_R$) and independent
of the typology of mechanical load (intrinsic dynamics); otherwise, in marked contrast, an {\it
asymmetry} is found, wherein the loading dynamics is typically faster than the relaxation one.
This asymmetry manifests itself with non-universal characteristics, e.g., dependency on the
applied load and/or on the viscoelastic properties of the RBC membrane. To deepen such a non-universal
behaviour, we consider the viscosity of the erythrocyte membrane as a variable parameter and focus
on three different typologies of mechanical load (mechanical stretching, shear flow, elongational
flow): this allows to clarify how non-universality builds up in terms of the deformation and rotational
contributions induced by the mechanical load on the membrane. Finally, we also investigate the
effect of the elastic shear modulus on the characteristic times $t_L$ and $t_R$. Our results provide
crucial and quantitative information on the unsteady dynamics of RBC and its membrane response
to the imposition/cessation of external mechanical loads.

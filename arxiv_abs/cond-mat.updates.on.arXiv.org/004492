We present the structural and magnetic properties of KNaCuP$_2$O$_7$ investigated via x-ray diffraction,
magnetization, specific heat, and $^{31}$P NMR and $^{23}$Na NMR measurements and complementary
electronic structure calculations. The temperature dependent magnetic susceptibility and $^{31}$P
NMR shift could be modeled very well by the uniform spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain
model with nearest-neighbour interaction $J/k_{\rm B}\simeq 58.7$ K. The corresponding mapping
using first principles electronic structure calculations leads to $J^{\rm DFT}/k_{\rm B} \simeq
59$ K with negligibly small inter-chain couplings ($J^{\prime}/k_{\rm B}$, $J^{\prime \prime}/k_{\rm
B} < 0.1$ K), further confirming that the system is indeed an one-dimensional uniform spin-$1/2$
Heisenberg antiferromagnet. The temperature-dependent unit cell volume could be described well
using the Debye approximation with a Debye temperature of $\Theta_{\rm D} \simeq 294$ K, consistent
with the heat capacity data. The diverging trend of the NMR spin-lattice relaxation rates ($^{31}1/T_1$
and $^{23}1/T_1$) imply the onset of a magnetic long-range-ordering at very low temperatures supporting
the anticipated $T_{\rm N} \simeq 0.38$ K from the inter-chain couplings. Moreover, the NMR spin-lattice
relaxation rates show the dominant contributions from uniform ($q=0$) and staggered ($q = \pm \pi/a$)
spin fluctuations in the high and low temperature regimes, respectively mimicking one-dimensionality
of the spin-lattice. We have also demonstrated that $^{31}1/T_1$ in high temperatures varies linearly
with $1/\sqrt{H}$ reflecting the effect of spin diffusion on the dynamic susceptibility. Further,
the inter-chain frustration also substantially impede the magnetic ordering rendering the spin-lattice
a perfect one-dimensional uniform spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet over a wide temperature
range.

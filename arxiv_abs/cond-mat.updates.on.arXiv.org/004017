A combination of theoretical modelling and experiments reveals the origin of the large perpendicular
magnetic anisotropy (PMA) that appears in nanometer-thick epitaxial Co films intercalated between
graphene (Gr) and a heavy metal (HM) substrate, as a function of the Co thickness. High quality epitaxial
Gr/Co\n/HM(111) (HM=Pt,Ir) heterostructures are grown by intercalation below graphene, which
acts as a surfactant that kinetically stabilizes the pseudomorphic growth of highly perfect Co
face-centered tetragonal ($fct$) films, with a reduced number of stacking faults as the only structural
defect observable by high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (HR-STEM). Magneto-optic
Kerr effect (MOKE) measurements show that such heterostructures present PMA up to large Co critical
thicknesses of about 4~nm (20~ML) and 2~nm (10~ML) for Pt and Ir substrates, respectively, while
X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) measurements show an inverse power law of the anistropy
of the orbital moment with Co thickness, reflecting its interfacial nature, that changes sign at
about the same critical values. First principles calculations show that, regardless of the presence
of graphene, ideal Co $fct$ films on HM buffers do not sustain PMAs beyond around 6~MLs due to the in-plane
contribution of the inner bulk-like Co layers. The large experimental critical thicknesses sustaining
PMA can only be retrieved by the inclusion of structural defects that promote a local $hcp$ stacking
such as twin boundaries or stacking faults. Remarkably, a layer resolved analysis of the orbital
momentum anisotropy reproduces its interfacial nature, and reveals that the Gr/Co interface contribution
is comparable to that of the Co/Pt(Ir).

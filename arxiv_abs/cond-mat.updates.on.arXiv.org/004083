The BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 compounds with x = 0 (parent), x = 0.10 (under-doped), x = 0.31, 0.33, 0.53 (superconductors
with Tc = 27.3 K, 27.6 K, 13.9 K, respectively) and x = 0.70, 0.77 (over-doped) have been investigated
versus temperature using 57Fe M\"ossbauer spectroscopy. Special attention was paid to regions
of the spin-density-wave (SDW) antiferromagnetic order, spin-nematic phase, and superconducting
transition. The BaFe2(As0.90P0.10)2 compound exhibits a reduced amplitude of SDW as compared
to the parent compound and preserved universality class of two-dimensional magnetic planes with
one-dimensional spins. The spin-nematic phase region for x = 0.10 is characterized by an incoherent
magnetic order. BaFe2(As0.69P0.31)2 shows coexistence of a weak magnetic order and superconductivity
due to the vicinity of the quantum critical point. The charge density modulations in the BaFe2(As0.67P0.33)2
and BaFe2(As0.47P0.53)2 superconductors are perturbed near Tc. Pronounced hump of the average
quadrupole splitting across superconducting transition is observed for the system with x = 0.33.
The phosphorus substitution increases the Debye temperature of the BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 compound.
Moreover, experimental electron charge densities at Fe nuclei in this material conclusively show
that it should be recognized as a hole-doped system. The measured M\"ossbauer spectral shift and
spectral area are not affected by transition to the superconducting state. This indicates that
neither the average electron density at Fe nuclei nor the dynamical properties of the Fe-sublattice
in BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 are sensitive to the superconducting transition. Theoretical calculations
of hyperfine parameters determining the patterns of M\"ossbauer spectra of BaFe2(As1-xPx)2 with
x = 0, 0.31, 0.5, and 1.0 are performed within the framework of the density functional theory.

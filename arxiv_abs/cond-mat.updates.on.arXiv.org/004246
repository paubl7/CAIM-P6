Bottom-up design of high entropy ceramics is a promising approach for realizing materials with
unique combinations of outstanding properties. A downside of this approach is that the vast compositional
space complicates the identification of candidate systems with desired properties. For example,
refractory ceramics are materials of crucial importance for applications at elevated temperature
and pressure. However, their characteristic brittleness considerably narrows potential uses.
Here, we offer a simple yet fundamental criterion -- valence electron concentration (VEC) > ~9.5
e-/f.u., to populate bonding metallic d-d states at the Fermi level -- for selecting elemental compositions
that can form rock-salt structured (B1) high-entropy refractory ceramics with both high hardness
and inherent resistance to fracture (enhanced toughness). As a proof of concept, we synthesize
and mechanically-test single-phase B1 (HfTaTiWZr)C and (MoNbTaVW)C, chosen as representative
high-entropy carbide (HEC) systems due to their specific VEC values. Nanoindentation arrays at
various loads and depths statistically demonstrate that (HfTaTiWZr)C (VEC=8.6 e-/f.u.) is very
hard but brittle, whilst (MoNbTaVW)C (VEC=9.4e-/f.u.) is hard and considerably more resistant
to fracture than (HfTaTiWZr)C. Extensive ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of tensile
and shearing deformation at room temperature reveal that local lattice transformations, activated
in (MoNbTaVW)C by loading beyond its yield point, allow dissipating accumulated stresses, thus
explaining its superior toughness. Additional AIMD simulations, carried out to follow the evolution
in mechanical properties as a function of temperature, show that (MoNbTaVW)C may retain outstanding
toughness up to ~900-1200K, whereas (HfTaTiWZr)C is predicted to maintain high hardness, but intrinsic
brittleness at all investigated temperatures.

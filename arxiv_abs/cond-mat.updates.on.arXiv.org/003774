Coarsening of bicontinuous microstructures is observed in a variety of systems, such as nanoporous
metals and mixtures that have undergone spinodal decomposition. To better understand the morphological
evolution of these structures during coarsening, we compare the morphologies resulting from two
different coarsening mechanisms, surface and bulk diffusion. We perform phase-field simulations
of coarsening via each mechanism in a two-phase mixture at nominal volume fractions of 50%-50% and
36%-64%, and the simulated structures are characterized in terms of topology (genus density),
the interfacial shape distribution, structure factor, and autocorrelations of phase and mean
curvature. We observe self-similar evolution of morphology and topology and agreement with the
expected power laws for dynamic scaling, in which the characteristic length scale increases over
time proportionally to $t^{1/4}$ for surface diffusion and $t^{1/3}$ for bulk diffusion. While
we observe the expected difference in the coarsening kinetics, we find that differences in self-similar
morphology due to coarsening mechanism are relatively small, although typically they are larger
at 36% volume fraction than at 50% volume fraction. In particular, we find that bicontinuous structures
coarsened via surface diffusion have lower scaled genus densities than structures coarsened via
bulk diffusion. We also compare the self-similar morphologies to those in literature and to two
model bicontinuous structures, namely, constant-mean-curvature surfaces based on the Schoen
G minimal surface and random leveled-wave structures. The average scaled mean curvatures of these
model structures agree reasonably with those of the coarsened structures at both 36% and 50%, but
we find substantial disagreements in the scaled genus densities and the standard deviations of
mean curvature.

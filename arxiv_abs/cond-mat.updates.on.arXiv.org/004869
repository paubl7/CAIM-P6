The motion of Brownian particles in nonlinear baths, such as, e.g., viscoelastic fluids, is of great
interest. We theoretically study a simple model for such bath, where two particles are coupled via
a sinusoidal potential. This model, which is an extension of the famous Prandtl Tomlinson model,
has been found to reproduce some aspects of recent experiments, such as shear-thinning and position
oscillations [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 154}, 184904 (2021)]. Analyzing this model in detail, we show
that the predicted behavior of position oscillations agrees qualitatively with experimentally
observed trends; (i) oscillations appear only in a certain regime of velocity and trap stiffness
of the confining potential, and (ii), the amplitude and frequency of oscillations increase with
driving velocity, the latter in a linear fashion. Increasing the potential barrier height of the
model yields a rupture transition as a function of driving velocity, where the system abruptly changes
from a mildly driven state to a strongly driven state. The frequency of oscillations scales as $(v_0-v_0^*)^{1/2}$
near the rupture velocity $v_0^*$, found for infinite trap stiffness. Investigating the (micro-)viscosity
for different parameter ranges, we note that position oscillations leave their signature by an
additional (mild) plateau in the flow curves, suggesting that oscillations influence the micro-viscosity.
For a time-modulated driving, the mean friction force of the driven particle shows a pronounced
resonance behavior, i.e, it changes strongly as a function of driving frequency. The model has two
known limits: For infinite trap stiffness, it can be mapped to diffusion in a tilted periodic potential.
For infinite bath friction, the original Prandtl Tomlinson model is recovered. We find that the
flow curve of the model (roughly) crosses over between these two limiting cases.

The evolution of local defects such as dislocations and cracks often determines the performance
of engineering materials. For a proper description and understanding of these phenomena, one needs
to descend to a very small scale, at which the discreteness of the material emerges. Fully-resolved
discrete numerical models often suffer from excessive computing expenses when used for application-scale
considerations. More efficient multiscale simulation procedures are thus called for, capable
of capturing the most significant microscopic phenomena while being computationally tractable.
Two broad classes of methods are available in the literature. The first class considers the fully-resolved
discrete system, which is subsequently reduced through suitable mathematical tools such as projection
and reduced integration. The second class first homogenizes the discrete system into an equivalent
continuum formulation, into which the main phenomena are added through specific enrichments.
This paper provides a thorough comparison of the two different modeling philosophies in terms of
their theory, accuracy, and performance. To this goal, two typical representatives are adopted:
the Quasicontinuum method for the first class, and an effective continuum with an embedded cohesive
zone model for the second class. Two examples are employed to demonstrate capabilities and limitations
of both approaches: dislocation propagation and pile-up against a coherent phase boundary, and
a three-point bending test of a concrete specimen with crack propagation. In both cases, the accuracy
of the two methods is compared against the fully-resolved discrete reference model. It is shown
that whereas continuum models with embedded cohesive zones offer good performance to accuracy
ratios, they might fail to capture unexpected mechanical behavior. The Quasicontinuum method
offers more flexibility at a higher computational cost.

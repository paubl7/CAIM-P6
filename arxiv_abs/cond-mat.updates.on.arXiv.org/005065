Boron rich chalcogenides have been predicted to have excellent properties for optical and mechanical
applications in recent times. In this regard, we report the electronic, optical and mechanical
properties of recently synthesized boron rich chalcogenide compounds, B12X (X = S and Se) using
density functional theory for the first time. The effects of exchange and correlation functional
on these properties are also investigated. The consistency of the obtained crystal structure with
the reported experimental results has been checked in terms of lattice parameters. The considered
materials are mechanically stable, brittle and elastically anisotropic. Furthermore, the elastic
moduli and hardness parameters are calculated, which show that B12S is likely to be a prominent member
of hard materials family compared to B12Se. The origin of different in hardness is explained on the
basis of density of states near the Fermi level. Reasonably good values of fracture toughness and
machinability index for B12X (X= S and Se) are reported. The melting point, Tm for the B12S and B12Se
compounds suggests that both solids are stable, at least up to 4208 and 3577 K, respectively. Indirect
band gap of B12S (2.27 eV) and B12Se (1.30 eV) are obtained using the HSE06 functional.The electrons
of B12Se compound show lighter average effective mass compared to that of B12S compound, which signifies
higher mobility of charge carriers in B12Se. The optical properties are characterized using GGA-PBE
and HSE06 method and discussed in detail. These compounds possess bulk optical anisotropy and excellent
absorption coefficients in visible light region along with very low static value of reflectivity
spectra (range: 7.42-14.0% using both functionals) are noted. Such useful features of the compounds
under investigation show promise for applications in optoelectronic and mechanical sectors.

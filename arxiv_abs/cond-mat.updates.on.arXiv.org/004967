Ferromagnetic metallic oxides have potential applications in spincaloric devices which utilize
the spin property of charge carriers for interconversion of heat and electricity through the spin
Seebeck or the anomalous Nernst effect or both. In this work, we synthesized polycrystalline La0.5S0.5CoO3
by microwave irradiation method and studied its transverse thermoelectric voltage (Nernst thermopower)
and change in the linear dimension of the sample (Joule magnetostriction) in response to external
magnetic fields. In addition, magnetization, temperature dependences of electrical resistivity,
and longitudinal Seebeck coefficient (Sxx) in absence of an external magnetic field were also measured.
The sample is ferromagnetic with a Curie temperature of TC = 247 K and shows a metal-like resistivity
above and below TC with a negative sign of Sxx suggesting charge transport due to electrons. Magnetic
field dependence of the Nernst thermopower (Sxy) at a fixed temperature shows a rapid increase at
low fields and a tendency to saturate at high fields as like the magnetization. Anomalous contribution
to Sxy was extracted from total Sxy measured and it exhibits a maximum value of ~ 0.21 microV/K at 180
K for H = 50 kOe, which is comparable to the value found in a single crystal for a lower Sr content. The
Joule magnetostriction is positive, i.e., the length of the sample expands along the direction
of the magnetic field and it does not saturate even at 50 kOe. The magnetostriction increases with
decreasing temperature below TC and reaches a maximum value of 500 ppm at T = 40 K and below. Coexistence
of the anomalous Nernst thermopower and giant magnetostriction in a single compound has potential
applications for thermal energy harvesting and low-temperature actuators, respectively.

We present a two-step method and the implemented code specifically tailored for band structure
calculation of the small-angle moir\'{e}-pattern materials. These materials contain tens of
thousands of atoms in a unit cell and the existing $ab~initio$ codes usually fail to do this within
a finite amount of time without simplifying approximations. Our method can dramatically reduce
the computational cost. Firstly, the self-consistent field calculation for ground state is performed
with $O(N)$ Krylov subspace method implemented in OpenMX, which is an $ab~initio$ package based
on localized pseudo-atomic orbitals (PAOs) and pseudo-potential method. Secondly, the crystal
momentum dependent Bloch Hamiltonian is constructed from the Hamiltonian matrix elements in PAO
basis set obtained in the first step and only selected eigenvalues of it is solved with Lanczos and
shift-invert techniques. The computational cost increases linearly with the number of atoms per
unit cell instead of cubically ($O(N^3)$) in other generally used $ab~initio$ packages. We obtained
the band structures for both rigid and corrugated twisted bilayer graphene structures at $\theta=2.00^\circ$,
$\theta=1.61^\circ$, $\theta=1.41^\circ$ and $\theta=1.08 ^\circ$ with improved accuracy
in affordable costs both in time and computer resources. They are in good agreement with those from
tight binding models, continuum models, and plane-wave pseudo-potential based $ab~initio$ calculations,
as well as the experimental observations. Our method has taken the advantages of $O(N)$ method,
local atomic orbital basis method, and Lanczos technique. This will play a crucial role in other
twisted two-dimensional materials with much more complex band structures than graphene, when
the continuum model or effective tight-binding model is hard to construct.

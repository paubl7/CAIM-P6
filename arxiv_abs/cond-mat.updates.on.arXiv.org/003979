Most commercial high-temperature superconducting coated conductors based on ion beam assisted
MgO deposited templates use $\mathrm{LaMnO_3}$ (LMO) films as the terminating buffer layer. In
contrast, coated conductors based on inclined substrate deposition (ISD)-MgO technology are
still produced with homoepitaxial (homoepi)-MgO as the cap layer. In this work we report on the deposition
of LMO buffer layers on ISD-MgO/homoepi-MgO by electron beam physical vapor deposition. The growth
parameters of textured LMO films were studied systematically and their properties were optimized
regarding the critical current densitiy ($J_\mathrm{c}$) of the subsequently deposited $\mathrm{DyBa_2Cu_3O}_{\mathrm{7-}\delta}$
(DyBCO) superconducting films. LMO films without outgrowths at the surface were obtained at growth
rates of up to $4\,\mathrm{\r{A}/s}$. Despite the formation of non-stoichiometric LMO films containing
$59\,\%$ La, single-phase films were obtained at substrate temperatures below $775^{\circ}\mathrm{C}$
and at oxygen partial pressures of up to $4\times10^{-4}\,\mathrm{mbar}$ due to a large homogeneity
region towards La. The $J_\mathrm{c}$ values of DyBCO films deposited on LMO were found to be independent
of the LMO thickness in a range from $50\,\mathrm{nm}$ to $450\,\mathrm{nm}$. DyBCO films on LMO
reach $J_\mathrm{c}=0.83\,\mathrm{MA/cm^2}$ at $77\,\mathrm{K}$ in zero applied field. This
value is up to $30\,\%$ higher than those of DyBCO films grown directly on homoepi-MgO. The wide range
of LMO growth parameters and higher $J_\mathrm{c}$ values of DyBCO on LMO compared to DyBCO on homoepi-MgO
make this material attractive for its use in manufacturing coated conductors based on ISD-MgO technology.

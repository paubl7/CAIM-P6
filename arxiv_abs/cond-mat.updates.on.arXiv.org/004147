Can quantum computational tools enhance the precision and efficiency of physical experiments?
Promising examples are known, but a systematic treatment and comprehensive framework are missing.
We introduce Quantum Algorithmic Measurements (QUALMs) to enable the study of quantum measurements
and experiments from the perspective of computational complexity and communication complexity.
The measurement process is described, in its utmost generality, by a many-round quantum interaction
protocol between the experimental system and a full-fledged quantum computer. The QUALM complexity
is quantified by the number of elementary operations performed by the quantum computer, including
its coupling to the experimental system. We study how the QUALM complexity depends on the type of
allowed access the quantum computer has to the experimental system: coherent, incoherent, etc.
We provide the first example of a measurement "task", which can be motivated by the study of Floquet
systems, for which the coherent access QUALM complexity is exponentially better than the incoherent
one, even if the latter is adaptive; this implies that using entanglement between different systems
in experiments, as well as coherence between probes to the physical system at different times, may
lead to exponential savings in resources. We extend our results to derive a similar exponential
advantage for another physically motivated measurement task which determines the symmetry class
of the time evolution operator for a quantum many-body system. Many open questions are raised towards
better understanding how quantum computational tools can be applied in experimental physics.
A major question is whether an exponential advantage in QUALM complexity can be achieved in the NISQ
era.

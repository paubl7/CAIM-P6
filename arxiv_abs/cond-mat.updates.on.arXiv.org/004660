Superconductors without inversion symmetry in their crystal structure are known to exhibit unconventional
properties. Recently, based on the measured temperature dependence of the magnetic field penetration
depth, superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric ThCoC2 was proposed to be a nodal $d$-wave and
mediated by the spin fluctuations. Moreover, a non-BCS behavior of the temperature dependence
of the electronic specific heat and the magnetic upper critical field were reported. In this work,
the electronic structure, phonons and electron-phonon coupling are studied in ThCoC2 on the basis
of ab initio computations. The effect of the spin-orbit coupling on the electronic structure and
electron-phonon interaction is analyzed, and large average splitting of the electronic band structure
$\Delta E_{SOC} = 150$ meV is found. The thermodynamic properties of the superconducting state
were determined numerically by solving Eliashberg equations, assuming the conventional $s$-wave
pairing symmetry. The evaluated electron-phonon coupling constant $\lambda = 0.59$ remains in
a decent agreement with the experimental estimates, showing that the electron-phonon interaction
is strong enough to explain the observed $T_c \simeq 2.5$ K, however it requires an enhanced value
of the Coulomb pseudopotential $\mu^*$. Calculated temperature dependence of the electronic
specific heat and magnetic penetration depth deviate from the BCS model. Moreover, neither the
BCS model nor the presented Eliashberg solutions can explain their experimentally observed temperature
dependence, supporting the non-$s$-wave picture of superconductivity in ThCoC2. To resolve the
pairing mechanism, we propose to measure the carbon isotope effect, as our calculations based on
the electron-phonon coupling predict the observation of the isotope effect with an exponent $\alpha
\simeq 0.15$.

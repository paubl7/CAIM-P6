We confirm the presence of a mean-field Bose glass in 2D quasicrystalline Bose-Hubbard models.
We focus on two models where the aperiodic component is present in different parts of the problem.
First, we consider a 2D generalisation of the Aubry-Andr\'e model, where the lattice geometry is
that of a square with a quasiperiodic onsite potential. Second, we consider the randomly disordered
vertex model, which takes aperiodic tilings with non-crystalline rotational symmetries, and
forms lattices from the vertices and lengths of the tiles. For the disordered vertex models, the
mean-field Bose glass forms across large ranges of the chemical potential, and we observe no significant
differences from the case of a square lattice with uniform random disorder. Small variations in
the critical points in the presence of random disorder between quasicrystalline and crystalline
lattice geometries can be accounted for by the varying coordination number and the different rotational
symmetries present. In the 2D Aubry-Andr\'e model, substantial differences are observed from
the usual phase diagrams of crystalline disordered systems. We show that weak modulation lines
can be predicted from the underlying potential and may stabilise or suppress the mean-field Bose
glass in certain regimes. This results in a lobe-like structure for the mean-field Bose glass in
the 2D Aubry-Andr\'e model, which is significantly different from the case of random disorder.
Together, the two quasicrystalline models studied in this work show that the mean-field Bose glass
phase is present, as expected for 2D quasiperiodic models. However, a quasicrystalline geometry
is not sufficient to result in differences from crystalline realisations of the Bose glass, whereas
a quasiperiodic form of disorder can result in different physics, as we observe in the 2D Aubry-Andr\'e
model.

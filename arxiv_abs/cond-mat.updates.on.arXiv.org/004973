If a binary liquid mixture, composed of two alternative species with equal amounts, is quenched
from a high temperature to a low temperature, below the critical point of demixing, then the mixture
will phase separate through a process known as spinodal decomposition. However, if the two alternative
species are allowed to interconvert, either naturally (e.g. the equilibrium interconversion
of enantiomers) or forcefully (e.g. via an external source of energy or matter), then the process
of phase separation may drastically change. In this case, two phenomena could be observed: either
phase amplification, the growth of one phase at the expense of the other, or microphase separation,
the formation of nongrowing (steady-state) microphase domains. In this work, we generalize the
mean-field Cahn-Hilliard theory of spinodal decomposition to include molecular interconversion
of species and describe the physical properties of systems undergoing phase amplification or microphase
separation. We show that the condition for phase amplification occurs if the equilibrium interconversion
rate is faster than the diffusion rate and the rate of forceful racemization (provided by an interconversion
energy source), while arrested microphase separation occurs if the rate of forceful racemization
is faster than the equilibrium interconversion and diffusion rate. The growth of the phase domain
for these two phenomena are characterized through the temporal evolution of the structure factor,
which exhibits a crossover from the early stages of spinodal decomposition to nucleation. We show
that the presence of a source of energy or matter drives the system into a nonequilibrium state with
the possibility of forming dissipative structures.

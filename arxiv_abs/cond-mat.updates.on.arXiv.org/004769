(abridged) We present a detailed derivation of a simple hydrodynamic two-fluid model, which aims
at the description of the phase separation of non-entangled polymer solutions, where viscoelastic
effects play a role. It is directly based upon the coarse-graining of a well-defined molecular model,
such that all degrees of freedom have a clear and unambiguous molecular interpretation. The considerations
are based upon a free-energy functional, and the dynamics is split into a conservative and a dissipative
part, where the latter satisfies the Onsager relations and the Second Law of thermodynamics. The
model is therefore fully consistent with both equilibrium and non-equilibrium thermodynamics.
The derivation proceeds in two steps: Firstly, we derive an extended model comprising two scalar
and four vector fields, such that inertial dynamics of the macromolecules and of the relative motion
of the two fluids is taken into account. In the second step, we eliminate these inertial contributions
and, as a replacement, introduce phenomenological dissipative terms, which can be modeled easily
by taking into account the principles of non-equilibrium thermodynamics. The final simplified
model comprises the momentum conservation equation, which includes both interfacial and elastic
stresses, a convection-diffusion equation where interfacial and elastic contributions occur
as well, and a suitably convected relaxation equation for the end-to-end vector field. In contrast
to the traditional two-scale description that is used to derive rheological equations of motion,
we here treat the hydrodynamic and the macromolecular degrees of freedom on the same basis. Nevertheless,
the resulting model is fairly similar, though not fully identical, to models that have been discussed
previously. Notably, we find a rheological constitutive equation that differs from the standard
Oldroyd-B model. ...

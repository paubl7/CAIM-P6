Materials with strong electronic correlations host remarkable -- and technologically relevant
-- phenomena such as magnetism, superconductivity and metal-insulator transitions. Harnessing
and controlling these effects is a major challenge, on which key advances are being made through
lattice and strain engineering in thin films and heterostructures, leveraging the complex interplay
between electronic and structural degrees of freedom. Here we show that the electronic structure
of LaNiO3 can be tuned by means of lattice engineering. We use different substrates to induce compressive
and tensile biaxial epitaxial strain in LaNiO3 thin films. Our measurements reveal systematic
changes of the optical spectrum as a function of strain and, notably, an increase of the low-frequency
free carrier weight as tensile strain is applied. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations,
we show that this apparently counter-intuitive effect is due to a change of orientation of the oxygen
octahedra.The calculations also reveal drastic changes of the electronic structure under strain,
associated with a Fermi surface Lifshitz transition. We provide an online applet to explore these
effects. The experimental value of integrated spectral weight below 2 eV is significantly (up to
a factor of 3) smaller than the DFT results, indicating a transfer of spectral weight from the infrared
to energies above 2 eV. The suppression of the free carrier weight and the transfer of spectral weight
to high energies together indicate a correlation-induced band narrowing and free carrier mass
enhancement due to electronic correlations. Our findings provide a promising avenue for the tuning
and control of quantum materials employing lattice engineering.

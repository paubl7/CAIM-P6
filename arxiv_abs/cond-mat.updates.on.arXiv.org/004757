Motivated by recent experiments indicating strong superconductivity and intricate correlated
insulating and flavor-polarized physics in mirror-symmetric twisted trilayer graphene, we study
the effects of interactions in this system close to the magic angle, using a combination of analytical
and numerical methods. We identify asymptotically exact correlated many-body ground states at
all integer filling fractions $\nu$ of the flat bands. To determine their fate when moving away from
these fine-tuned points, we apply self-consistent Hartree-Fock numerics and analytic perturbation
theory, with good agreement between the two approaches. This allows us to construct a phase diagram
for the system as a function of $\nu$ and the displacement field, the crucial experimental tuning
parameter of the system, and study the spectra of the different phases. The phase diagram is dominated
by a correlated semimetallic intervalley coherent state and an insulating sublattice-polarized
phase around charge neutrality, $\nu=0$, with additional spin-polarization being present at
quarter ($\nu=-2$) or three quarter ($\nu=+2$) fillings of the quasi-flat bands. We further study
the superconducting instabilities emerging from these correlated states, both in the absence
and in the additional presence of electron-phonon coupling, also taking into account possible
Wess-Zumino-Witten terms. In the experimentally relevant regime, we find triplet pairing to dominate,
possibly explaining the observed violation of the Pauli limit. Our results have several consequences
for experiments as well as future theoretical work and illustrate the rich physics resulting from
the interplay of almost flat bands and dispersive Dirac cones in twisted trilayer graphene.

Strain localization is an instability phenomenon occurring in deformable solid materials which
undergo dissipative deformation mechanisms. Such instability is characterized by the localization
of the displacement or velocity fields in a zone of finite thickness and is generally associated
with the failure of materials. In several fields of material engineering and natural sciences,
estimating the thickness of localized deformation is required to make accurate predictions of
the evolution of the physical properties within localized strain regions and of the material strength.
In this context, scientists and engineers often rely on numerical modeling techniques to study
strain localization in solid materials. However, classical continuum theory for elasto-plastic
materials fails at estimating strain localization thicknesses due to the lack of an internal length
in the model constitutive laws. In this study, we investigate at which conditions multiphysics
coupling enables to regularize the problem of strain localization using rate-dependent plasticity.
We show that coupling the constitutive laws for deformation to a single generic diffusion-reaction
equation representing a dissipative state variable can be sufficient to regularize the ill-posed
problem under some conditions on the softening parameters in the plastic potential. We demonstrate
in these cases how rate-dependent plasticity and multiphysics coupling can lead to material instabilities
depicting one or several internal length scales controlled by the physical parameters resulting
in the formation of regular or erratic patterns. As we consider a general form of the equations, the
results presented in this study can be applied to a large panel of examples in the material engineering
and geosciences communities.

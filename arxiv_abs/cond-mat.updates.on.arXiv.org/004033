Hybrid multiferroics such as BiFeO$_3$ (BFO) and La$_{0.7}$Sr$_{0.3}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) heterostructures
are highly interesting functional systems due to their complex electronic and magnetic properties.
One of the key parameters influencing the emergent properties is the quality of interfaces, where
varying interdiffusion lengths can give rise to different chemistry and distinctive electronic
states. Here we report high-resolution depth resolved chemical and electronic investigation
of BFO/LSMO superlattice using standing-wave hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy in the first-order
Bragg as well as near-total-reflection geometry. Our results show that the interfaces of BFO on
top of LSMO are atomically abrupt, while the LSMO on top of BFO interfaces show an interdiffusion
length of around 1.2 unit cells. The two interfaces also exhibit different chemical gradients,
with the BFO/LSMO interface being Sr-terminated by a spectroscopically distinctive high binding
energy component in Sr 2p core-level spectra, which is spatially contained within 1 unit cell from
the interface. From the electronic point of view, unique valence band features were observed for
bulk-BFO, bulk-LSMO and their interfaces. Our X-ray optical analysis revealed a unique electronic
signature at the BFO/LSMO interface, which we attribute to the coupling between those respective
layers. Valence band decomposition based on the Bragg-reflection standing-wave measurement
also revealed the band alignment between BFO and LSMO layers. Our work demonstrates that standing-wave
hard x-ray photoemission is a reliable non-destructive technique for probing depth-resolved
electronic structure of buried layers and interfaces with sub-unit-cell resolution. Equivalent
investigations can be successfully applied to a broad class of material such as perovskite complex
oxides with emergent interfacial phenomena.

Ring polymers exhibit unique flow properties due to their closed chain topology. Despite recent
progress, we have not yet achieved a full understanding of the nonequilibrium flow behavior of rings
in nondilute solutions where intermolecular interactions greatly influence chain dynamics.
In this work, we directly observe the dynamics of DNA rings in semidilute ring-linear polymer blends
using single molecule techniques. We systematically investigate ring polymer relaxation dynamics
from high extension and transient and steady-state stretching dynamics in planar extensional
flow for a series of ring-linear blends with varying ring fraction. Our results show multiple molecular
sub-populations for ring relaxation in ring-linear blends, as well as large conformational fluctuations
for rings in steady extensional flow, even long after the initial transient stretching process
has subsided. We further quantify the magnitude and characteristic timescales of ring conformational
fluctuations as a function of blend composition. Interestingly, we find that the magnitude of ring
conformational fluctuations follows a non-monotonic response with increasing ring fraction,
first increasing at low ring fraction and then substantially decreasing at large ring fraction
in ring-linear blends. A unique set of ring polymer conformations are observed during the transient
stretching process, which highlights the prevalence of molecular individualism and supports
the notion of complex intermolecular interactions in ring-linear polymer blends. Together with
results from molecular simulations, our results suggest that ring conformational fluctuations
arise due to ring-linear threading and intermolecular hydrodynamic interactions (HI). Taken
together, our results provide a new molecular understanding of ring polymer dynamics in ring-linear
blends in nonequilibrium flow.

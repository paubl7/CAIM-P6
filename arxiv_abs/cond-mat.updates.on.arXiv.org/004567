The ability to image materials at the microscale from long-wavelength wave data is a major challenge
to the geophysical, engineering and medical fields. Here, we present a framework to constrain microstructure
geometry and properties from long-scale waves. To realistically quantify microstructures we
use two-point statistics, from which we derive scale-dependent effective wave properties - wavespeed
and attenuation - using strong-contrast expansions (SCE) for (visco)elastic wavefields. By evaluating
various two-point correlation functions we observe that both effective wavespeeds and attenuation
of long-scale waves predominantly depend on volume fraction and phase properties, and that especially
attenuation at small scales is highly sensitive to the geometry of microstructure heterogeneity
(e.g. geometric hyperuniformity) due to incoherent inference of sub-wavelength multiple scattering.
Our goal is to infer microstructure properties from observed effective wave parameters. To this
end, we use the supervised machine learning method of Random Forests (RF) to construct a Bayesian
inference approach. We can accurately resolve two-point correlation functions sampled from various
microstructural configurations, including: a bead pack, Berea sandstone and Ketton limestone
samples. Importantly, we show that inversion of small scale-induced effective elastic waves yields
the best results, particularly compared to single-wave-mode (e.g., acoustic only) information.
Additionally, we show that the retrieval of microscale medium contrasts is more difficult - as it
is highly ill-posed - and can only be achieved with specific a priori knowledge. Our results are promising
for many applications, such as earthquake hazard monitoring,non-destructive testing, imaging
fluid flow in porous media, quantifying tissue properties in medical ultrasound, or designing
materials with tailor-made wave properties.

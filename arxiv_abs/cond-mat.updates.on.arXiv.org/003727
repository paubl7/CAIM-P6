Using Density Functional Theory we theoretically study the orientational properties of uniform
phases of hard kites -- two isosceles triangles joined by their common base. Two approximations
are used: Scaled Particle Theory, and a new approach which better approximates third virial coefficients
of two-dimensional hard particles. By varying some of their geometrical parameters kites can be
transformed into squares, rhombuses, triangles, and also very elongated particles, even reaching
the hard-needle limit. Thus a fluid of hard kites, depending on the particle shape, can stabilize
isotropic, nematic, tetratic and triatic phases. Different phase diagrams are calculated, including
those of rhombuses, and kites with two of their equal interior angles fixed to $90^{\circ}$, $60^{\circ}$
and $75^{\circ}$. Kites with one of their unequal angles fixed to $72^{\circ}$, which have been
recently studied via Monte Carlo simulations, are also considered. We find that rhombuses and kites
with two equal right angles and not too large anisometry stabilise the tetratic phase but the latter
stabilize it to a much higher degree. By contrast, kites with two equal interior angles fixed to $60^{\circ}$
stabilize the triatic phase to some extent, although it is very sensitive to changes in particle
geometry. Kites with the two equal interior angles fixed to $75^{\circ}$ have a phase diagram with
both tetratic and triatic phases, but we show the nonexistence of a particle shape for which both
phases are stable at different densities. Finally the success of the new theory in the description
of orientational order in kites is shown by comparing with Monte Carlo simulations for the case where
one of the unequal angles is fixed to $72^{\circ}$. These particles also present phase diagrams
with stable tetratic and triatic phases.

Core level binding energies and absorption edges are at the heart of many experimental techniques
concerned with element-specific structure, electronic structure, chemical reactivity, elementary
excitations and magnetism. X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) in particular, can provide
information about the electronic and vibrational many-body interactions in a solid as these are
reflected in the detailed energy distribution of the photoelectrons. Ultrafast pump-probe techniques
add a new dimension to such studies, introducing the ability to probe a transient state of the many-body
system. Here we use a free electron laser to investigate the effect of a transiently excited electron
gas on the core level spectrum of graphene, showing that it leads to a large broadening of the C 1s peak.
Confirming a decade-old prediction, the broadening is found to be caused by an exchange of energy
and momentum between the photoemitted core electron and the hot electron system, rather than by
vibrational excitations. This interpretation is supported by a line shape analysis that accounts
for the presence of the excited electrons. Fitting the spectra to this model directly yields the
electronic temperature of the system, in agreement with electronic temperature values obtained
from valence band data. Furthermore, making use of time- and momentum-resolved C 1s spectra, we
illustrate how the momentum change of the outgoing core electrons leads to a small but detectable
change in the time-resolved photoelectron diffraction pattern and to a nearly complete elimination
of the core level binding energy variation associated with the narrow $\sigma$-band in the C 1s state.
The results demonstrate that the XPS line shape can be used as an element-specific and local probe
of the excited electron system and that X-ray photoelectron diffraction investigations remain
feasible at very high electronic temperatures.

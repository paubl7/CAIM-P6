Recently, CoSi has been identified to have unconventional electronic topology due to lack of inversion
center in its B20 cubic structure. The electronic topology has been reported to be present at three
nodal points found in the band structure. Two of these nodal points are situated at the $\Gamma$ (G1
\& G2) and one at $R$ (R1) point. Based on this, we present a study where various transport coefficients
are investigated by using \textit{first-principle} based DFT method for the temperature (T) range
40-300 K. For the chemical potential ($\mu$) corresponding to energies of these nodal points and
at the Fermi level (E$_F$), 3D constant energy surfaces are constructed. They have shown that the
number of states available at energies of these nodal points and the E$_F$ follows an increasing
trend as R1 $>$ G2 $>$ E$_F$ $>$ G1 at T = 0 K. Similar increasing behavior seems to follow by other transport
coefficients at different $\mu$ with T rise such as electrical conductivity($\sigma$)/relaxation
time($\tau$) ratio and electronic thermal conductivity ($\kappa_e/\tau$ = $\kappa^0$). For
example, at T = 100 K, $\sigma / \tau$ $\sim$ 0.13$\times$10$^{20}$ $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1} s^{-1}$
at G1 whereas its value reaches $ \sim$ 0.18$\times$10$^{20}$ $\Omega^{-1} m^{-1} s^{-1}$ at R1
nodal point. However, Seebeck coefficient ($S$) seems to follow the trend as G2 $>$ E$_F$ $>$ R1 $>$
G1 at any given T. The values of $S$ are obtained to be positive at the $\mu$ corresponding to the G2,
R1 and E$_F$ (except G1) which is increasing with the rise in T. Also, the dominant charge carriers
at G1 point are found to be electrons for T $<$ 225 K whereas for T $>$ 225 K, the charge carriers are obtained
to be dominated by holes. Furthermore, the doping concentrations have also been calculated for
G1, G2 and R1 points.

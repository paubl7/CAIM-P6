A system of partial differential equations is derived to compute the full-field stress from an observed
strain field when the plastic component of the material constitutive equation is unknown. These
equations generalize previously proposed equations that are valid in the case where the elastic
strain is negligible. The system of equations assume that the constitutive relations are isotropic,
but otherwise make few assumptions and can be directly applied (without modification) to cases
of finite deformation, non-linear elasticity and plasticity, compressible materials, rate dependent
materials, and a variety of different yield surface shapes and hardening laws. Unlike the prior
linear hyperbolic partial differential equations, this system of equations is non-linear and
time dependent. The newly proposed equations can be used to solve for the stress field (and hence
constitutive equation), for arbitrary geometries and loading conditions when the full-field
strain is known. This generalization resolves a significant challenge in computing the stress
during elasto-plastic deformations: some regions of the material will be elastically unloading
while others are undergoing significant plastic deformation. This problem significantly limited
applications of the previously proposed equations, but is fully resolved here. A two-dimensional
case study of necking in a uniaxial tensile test specimen is investigated to illustrate the method.
The governing equations are numerically solved using an algorithm based on on the finite volume
method developed in an accompanying work. This is validated against the solution to the forward
problem and shown to give accurate results (within numerical error of the true solution). This case
study thus demonstrates that the developed approach has unique capabilities, including the first
theoretically exact solution to this well studied problem.

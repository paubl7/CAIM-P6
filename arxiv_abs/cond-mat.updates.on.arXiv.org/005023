Topological insulators (TIs) are a class of materials which are insulating in their bulk form yet,
upon introduction of an a boundary or edge, e.g. by abruptly terminating the material, may exhibit
spontaneous current along their boundary. This property is quantified by topological indices
associated with either the bulk or the edge system. In the field of condensed matter physics, tight
binding (discrete) approximate models, parametrized by hopping coefficients, have been used
successfully to capture the topological behavior of TIs in many settings. However, whether such
tight binding models capture the same topological features as the underlying continuum models
of quantum physics has been an open question. We resolve this question in the context of the archetypal
example of topological behavior in materials, the integer quantum Hall effect. We study a class
of continuum Hamiltonians, $H^\lambda$, which govern electrons motion in a two-dimensional crystal
under the influence of a perpendicular magnetic field. No assumption is made on translation invariance
of the crystal. We prove, in the regime where both the magnetic field strength and depth of the crystal
potential are sufficiently large, $\lambda\gg1$, that the low-lying energy spectrum and eigenstates
(and corresponding large time dynamics) of $H^\lambda$ are well-described by a scale-free discrete
Hamiltonian, $H^{\rm TB}$ (we show norm resolvent convergence). We then prove that the relevant
topological index, the Hall conductivity, expressible as a Fredholm index, agrees for $H^\lambda$
and $H^{\rm TB}$. This is proved separately for bulk and edge geometries. Our results justify the
principle of using discrete models in the study of topological matter.

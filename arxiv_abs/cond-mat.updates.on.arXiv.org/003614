Responsive particles, such as biomacromolecules or hydrogels, display a broad and polymodal distribution
of conformations and have thus the ability to change their properties (e.g, size, shape, charge
density, etc.) substantially in response to external fields or to their local environment (e.g.,
mediated by cosolutes or pH). Here, we discuss the basic statistical mechanics for a model of responsive
colloids (RCs) by introducing an additional property degree of freedom as a collective variable
in a formal coarse-graining procedure. The latter leads to an additional one-body term in the coarse-grained
(CG) free energy, defining a single-particle property distribution for an individual polydisperse
RC. We argue that in the equilibrium thermodynamic limit such a CG system of RCs behaves like a conventional
polydisperse system of non-responsive particles. We then illustrate the action of external fields,
which impose local (position-dependent) property distributions leading to non-trivial effects
on the spatial one-body property and density profiles, even for an ideal (non-interacting) gas
of RCs. We finally apply density functional theory in the local density approximation (LDA-DFT)
to discuss the effects of particle interactions for specific examples of i) a suspension of RCs in
an external field linear in both position and property, ii) a suspension of RCs with highly localized
properties (sizes) confined between two walls, and iii) a two-component suspension where an inhomogeneously
distributed (non-responsive) cosolute component, as found, e.g., in the studies of osmolyte-
or salt-induced collapse/swelling transitions of thermosensitive polymers, modifies the local
properties and density of the RC liquid.

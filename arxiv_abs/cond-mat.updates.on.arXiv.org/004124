Recent advances in realizing optical frequency combs using nonlinear parametric processes in
integrated photonic resonators have revolutionized on-chip optical clocks, spectroscopy, and
multi-channel optical communications. At the same time, the introduction of topological physics
in photonic systems has provided a new paradigm to engineer the flow of photons, and thereby, design
photonic devices with novel functionalities and inherent robustness against fabrication disorders.
Here, we use topological design principles to theoretically propose the generation of optical
frequency combs and temporal Kerr solitons in a two-dimensional array of coupled ring resonators
that creates a synthetic magnetic field for photons and exhibits topological edge states. We show
that these topological edge states constitute a traveling-wave super-ring resonator that leads
to the generation of coherent nested optical frequency combs, and self-formation of nested temporal
solitons and Turing rolls that are remarkably phase-locked over >40 rings. In the nested soliton
regime, our system operates as a pulsed optical frequency comb and achieves a mode efficiency of
>50%, an order of magnitude higher than single ring frequency combs that are theoretically limited
to only ~5%. Furthermore, we show that the topological nested solitons are robust against defects
in the lattice. This topological frequency comb works in a parameter regime that can be readily accessed
using existing low loss integrated photonic platforms like silicon-nitride. Our results could
pave the way for efficient on-chip optical frequency combs, and investigations of various other
soliton solutions in conjunction with synthetic gauge fields and topological phenomena in large
arrays of coupled resonators.

A bredge (bridge-edge) is an edge whose deletion would split the network component on which it resides
into two components. Bredges are vulnerable links that play an important role in network collapse
processes, which may result from node or link failures, attacks or epidemics. Therefore, the abundance
and properties of bredges affect the resilience of the network. We present analytical results for
the statistical properties of bredges in configuration model networks. Using a generating function
approach based on the cavity method, we calculate the probability $\hat P(e\in{\rm B})$ that a random
edge e in a configuration model network with degree distribution P(k) is a bredge (B). We also calculate
the joint degree distribution $\hat P(k,k'|{\rm B})$ of the end-nodes of a random bredge. We examine
the distinct properties of bredges on the giant component (GC) and on the finite tree components
(FC) of the network. On the finite components all the edges are bredges and there are no degree-degree
correlations. We calculate the probability $\hat P(e\in{\rm B}|{\rm GC})$ that a random edge on
the giant component is a bredge. We also calculate the joint degree distribution $\hat P(k,k'|{\rm
B},{\rm GC})$ of the end-nodes of bredges and the joint degree distribution $\hat P(k,k'|{\rm NB},{\rm
GC})$ of the end-nodes of non-bredge (NB) edges on the giant component. Surprisingly, it is found
that the degrees k and k' of the end-nodes of bredges are correlated, while the degrees of the end-nodes
of NB edges are uncorrelated. We thus conclude that all the degree-degree correlations on the giant
component are concentrated on the bredges. We calculate the covariance of end-nodes of bredges
and show it is negative, namely bredges tend to connect high degree nodes to low degree nodes. The
implications of the results are discussed in the context of common attack scenarios and dismantling
processes.

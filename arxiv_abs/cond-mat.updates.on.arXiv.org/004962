The frictional instability associated with earthquake initiation and earthquake dynamics is
believed to be mainly controlled by the dynamics of fragmented rocks within the fault gauge. Principal
features of the emerging seismicity (e.g. intermittent dynamics and broad time and/or energy scales)
have been replicated by simple experimental setups, which involve a slowly driven slider on top
of granular matter, for example. Yet, these set-ups are often physically limited and might not allow
one to determine the underlying nature of specific features and, hence, the universality and generality
of the experimental observations. Here, we address this challenge by a numerical study of a spring-slider
experiment based on two dimensional discrete element method simulations, which allows us to control
the properties of the granular matter and of the surface of the slider, for example. Upon quasi-static
loading, stick-slip-type behavior emerges which is contrasted by a stable sliding regime at finite
driving rates, in agreement with experimental observations. Across large parameter ranges for
damping, inter-particle friction, particle polydispersity etc. the earthquake-like dynamics
associated with the former regime results in several robust scale-free statistical features also
observed in experiments. At first sight these closely resemble the main empirical relations of
tectonic seismicity at geological scales. Yet, we show that the correlations associated with tectonic
aftershocks are absent such that the origin of the Omori-Utsu relation, the aftershock productivity
relation, and B{\aa}th's relation in the simulations is fundamentally different from the case
of tectonic seismicity. We argue that the same is true for previous lab experiments.

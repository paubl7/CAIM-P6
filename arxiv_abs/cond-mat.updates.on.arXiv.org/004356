Naturally random devices that exploit ambient thermal noise have recently attracted attention
as hardware primitives for accelerating probabilistic computing applications. One such approach
is to use a low barrier nanomagnet as the free layer of a magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) whose magnetic
fluctuations are converted to resistance fluctuations in the presence of a stable fixed layer.
Here, we propose and theoretically analyze a magnetic tunnel junction with no fixed layers but two
free layers that are circularly shaped disk magnets. We use an experimentally benchmarked model
that accounts for finite temperature magnetization dynamics, bias-dependent charge and spin-polarized
currents as well as the dipolar coupling between the free layers. We obtain analytical results for
statistical averages of fluctuations that are in good agreement with the numerical model. We find
that the free layers with low diameters fluctuate to randomize the resistance of the MTJ in an approximately
bias-independent manner. We show how such MTJs can be used to build a binary stochastic neuron (or
a p-bit) in hardware. Unlike earlier stochastic MTJs that need to operate at a specific bias point
to produce random fluctuations, the proposed design can be random for a wide range of bias values,
independent of spin-transfer-torque pinning. Moreover, in the absence of a carefully optimized
stabled fixed layer, the symmetric double-free layer stack can be manufactured using present day
Magnetoresistive Random Access Memory (MRAM) technology by minimal changes to the fabrication
process. Such devices can be used as hardware accelerators in energy-efficient computing schemes
that require a large throughput of tunably random bits.

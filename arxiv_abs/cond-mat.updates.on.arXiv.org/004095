Chemical vapor deposition has been most recently employed to fabricate centimeter-scale high-quality
single-layer MoSi2N4 (Science; 2020;369; 670). Motivated by this exciting experimental advance,
herein we conduct extensive first-principles based simulations to explore the stability, mechanical
properties, lattice thermal conductivity, piezoelectric and flexoelectric response, and photocatalytic
and electronic features of MA2Z4 (M = Cr, Mo, W; A = Si, Ge; Z = N, P) monolayers. The considered nanosheets
are found to exhibit dynamical stability and remarkably high mechanical properties. Moreover,
they show diverse electronic properties from antiferromagnetic metal to half metal and to semiconductors
with band gaps ranging from 0.31 to 2.57 eV. Among the studied nanosheets, the MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4
monolayers yield appropriate band edge positions, high electron and hole mobilities, and strong
visible light absorption, highly promising for applications in optoelectronics and photocatalytic
water splitting. The MoSi2N4 and WSi2N4 monolayers are also predicted to show outstandingly high
lattice thermal conductivity of 440 and 500 W/mK, respectively. For the first time we show that machine
learning interatomic potentials trained over small supercells can be employed to examine the flexoelectric
and piezoelectric properties of complex structures. As the most exciting finding, WSi2N4, CrSi2N4
and MoSi2N4 are found to exhibit the highest piezoelectric coefficients, outperforming all other-known
2D materials. Our results highlight that MA2Z4 nanosheets not only undoubtedly outperform the
transition metal dichalcogenides family but also can compete with graphene for applications in
nanoelectronics, optoelectronic, energy storage/conversion and thermal management systems.

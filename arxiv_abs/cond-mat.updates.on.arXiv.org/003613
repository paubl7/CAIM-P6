In the present work, we study an electrolyte solution confined between planar surfaces with nonopatterned
charged domains, which has been connected to a bulk ionic reservoir. The system is investigated
through an improved Monte Carlo (MC) simulation method, suitable for simulation of electrolytes
in the presence of modulated surface charge distributions. We also employ a linear approach in the
spirit of the classical Debye-H\"uckel approximation, which allows one to obtain explicit expressions
for the averaged potentials, ionic profiles, effective surface interactions and the net ionic
charge confined between the walls. Emphasis is placed in the limit of strongly confined electrolytes,
in which case local electroneutrality in the inter-surface space might not be fulfilled. In order
to access the effects of such lack of local charge neutrality on the ionic-induced interactions
between surfaces with modulated charge domains, we consider two distinct model systems for the
confined electrolyte: one in which a salt reservoir is explicitly taken into account {\it via} the
osmotic equilibrium with an electrolyte of fixed bulk concentration, and a second one in which the
equilibrium with a charge neutral ionic reservoir is implicitly considered. While in the former
case the osmotic ionic exchange might lead to non-vanishing net charges, in the latter model charge
neutrality is enforced through the appearance of an implicit Donnan potential across the charged
interfaces. A strong dependence of the ionic-induced surface interactions in the employed model
system is observed at all particle separations. These findings strongly suggest that due care is
to be taken while choosing among different scenarios to describe the ionic exchanging in electrolytes
confined between charged surfaces, even in cases when the monopole (non zero net charge) surface
contributions are absent.

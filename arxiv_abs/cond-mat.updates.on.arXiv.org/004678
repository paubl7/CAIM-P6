Modern computation based on the von Neumann architecture is today a mature cutting-edge science.
In this architecture, processing and memory units are implemented as separate blocks interchanging
data intensively and continuously. This data transfer is responsible for a large part of the power
consumption. The next generation computer technology is expected to solve problems at the exascale.
Even though these future computers will be incredibly powerful, if they are based on von Neumann
type architectures, they will consume between 20 and 30 megawatts of power and will not have intrinsic
physically built-in capabilities to learn or deal with complex and unstructured data as our brain
does. Neuromorphic computing systems are aimed at addressing these needs. The human brain performs
about 10^15 calculations per second using 20W and a 1.2L volume. By taking inspiration from biology,
new generation computers could have much lower power consumption than conventional processors,
could exploit integrated non-volatile memory and logic, and could be explicitly designed to support
dynamic learning in the context of complex and unstructured data. Among their potential future
applications, business, health care, social security, disease and viruses spreading control
might be the most impactful at societal level. This roadmap envisages the potential applications
of neuromorphic materials in cutting edge technologies and focuses on the design and fabrication
of artificial neural systems. The contents of this roadmap will highlight the interdisciplinary
nature of this activity which takes inspiration from biology, physics, mathematics, computer
science and engineering. This will provide a roadmap to explore and consolidate new technology
behind both present and future applications in many technologically relevant areas.

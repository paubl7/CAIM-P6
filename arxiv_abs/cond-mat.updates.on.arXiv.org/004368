Non-volatile magnetic storage, from 1940s magnetic core to present day racetrack memory and magnetic
anisotropy switching devices rely on the metastability of magnetic domains to store information.
However, the inherent inefficiency of converting the information-carrying charge current into
magnetization switching sets fundamental limitations in energy consumption. Other non-magnetic
non-volatile memories such as memristors, ferroelectric memory and phase change memory devices
also rely on energetically relatively costly crystal structural rearrangements to store information.
In contrast, conventional electronic charge states in quantum dots for example, can be switched
in femtoseconds with high efficiency, but any stored information dissipates rapidly. Here we present
a radically different approach in the form of a charge-configuration memory (CCM) device that relies
on charge-injection-driven electronic crystal melting and topological protection of the resulting
electronic domain configurations of a two-dimensional electronic crystal to store information.
With multiprobe scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) we show microscopically, within an operational
device, how dislocations in the domain ordering lead to metastability by a mechanism that is topologically
equivalent to magnetic bubble memory. The devices have a very small switching energy (<2.2 fJ/bit),
ultrafast switching speed of <11 ps and operational range over more than 3 orders of magnitude in
temperature (<250 mK ~ 190 K). Together with their simple functionality, a large resistance switching
ratio, straightforward fabrication and impressive endurance, CCM devices introduce a new memory
paradigm in emerging cryo-computing and other high-performance computing applications that
require ultrahigh speed and low energy consumption.

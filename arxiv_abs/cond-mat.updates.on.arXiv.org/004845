We address here the issue of quantum measurement in which the interaction between the system at hand
and the measuring apparatus causes a collapse of the wave function or the density operator. The analysis
is carried out for the prototypical tight-binding chain involving a quantum particle hopping between
nearest-neighbour sites on a lattice, with the system subject to repeated projective measurements
to a detector site. However, unlike previous work, the measurements are performed at random times.
In the absence of measurement, the particle while starting from a site is known to spread out to farther
sites as time progresses, leading to complete delocalization of the particle in time. In presence
of measurements, we derive exact results for the probability at a given time for the particle to be
found on different sites and averaged with respect to different realizations of the dynamics. We
consider the representative case in which the time gap between successive measurements are sampled
independently from an exponential distribution. The novel result of our findings is the revelation
of the striking effect of Stochastic Localization, whereby the particle has at long times time-independent
probabilities to be on different sites. This implies localization of the particle at long times,
achieved through classical stochasticity involved with the random times for measurements. An
extreme case of such localization is attained if the measurements are done very frequently, when
the particle is completely localized at the detector site! We also point out the stochastic version
of the Zeno effect, whereby dynamical evolution of a quantum system is arrested through repeated
measurements at frequent-enough times. In the wake of recent experiments on projective measurements
at random times achieved through randomly-pulsed sequences, our proposition is amenable to experimental
realization.

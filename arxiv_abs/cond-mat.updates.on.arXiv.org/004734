Landau's Fermi liquid theory is a cornerstone of quantum many body physics. At its heart is the adiabatic
connection between the elementary excitations of an interacting fermion system and those of the
same system with the interactions turned off. Recently, this tenet has been challenged with the
finding of a non-Landau Fermi liquid, that is a strongly interacting Fermi liquid that cannot be
adiabatically connected to a non-interacting system. In particular, a spin-1 two-channel Kondo
impurity with single-ion magnetic anisotropy $D$ has a topological quantum phase transition at
a critical value $D_c$: for $D < D_c$ the system behaves as an ordinary Fermi liquid with a large Fermi
level spectral weight, while above $D_c$ the system is a non-Landau Fermi liquid with a pseudogap
at the Fermi level, topologically characterized by a non-trivial Friedel sum rule with non-zero
Luttinger integrals. Here, we develop a non-trivial extension of this new Fermi liquid theory to
general multi-orbital problems with finite magnetic field and we reinterpret in a unified and consistent
fashion several experimental studies of iron phthalocyanine molecules on Au(111) metal substrate
that were previously described in disconnected and conflicting ways. The differential conductance
measured using a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) shows a zero-bias dip that widens when the
molecule is lifted from the surface and is transformed continuously into a peak under an applied
magnetic field. Numerically solving a spin-1 impurity model with single-ion anisotropy for realistic
parameter values, we robustly reproduce all these central features, allowing us to conclude that
iron phthalocyanine molecules on Au(111) constitute the first confirmed experimental realization
of a non-Landau Fermi liquid.

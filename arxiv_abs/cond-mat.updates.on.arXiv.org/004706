The uniform field assumption used to derive semi-classical cutoff energies of $10U_p$ for electron
emission and $3.17U_p$ for high harmonic generation is applicable for ponderomotive amplitudes
($\propto E\lambda^2$) much smaller than the field drop-off scale. For large wavelength and high
field experiments at nanoscale structures this assumption may break down by predicting energies
beyond the true classical energy limits. Here we provide generalized calculations for these cutoff
energies by taking into account the spatial field drop-off. The modified cutoff energies vary significantly
from the uniform field results even with ponderomotive amplitudes still an order of magnitude below
the field drop-off scale. Electron emission and scattering energy as a function of the time-of-ionization
is considered for the nanotip ($\sim1/r^2$) field profile. The cutoff energies as a function of
the adiabaticity parameter $\delta$, which may be easily calculated for given wavelength, apex
field strength, and nanostructure scale, are then determined through maximization for nanotip,
nanoblade ($\sim1/r$), and exponential field profiles. These profiles deviate from each other
in electron emission energy by up to nearly a factor of the ponderomotive energy, indicating the
importance of mid-field profile behavior. The electron emission energy cutoff also attains an
additional factor of $U_p$ due to the smooth integrated ponderomotive force in the adiabatic drop-off
and very long pulse regime. These results also provided as double-exponential fits for ease of use.
We then compare the nanoblade electron emission cutoffs with a quantum simulation of the electron
rescattering process. We also consider a short (few-cycle) pulsed field, focusing on a cosine-like
pulse and overviewing the general carrier-envelope phase dependencies.

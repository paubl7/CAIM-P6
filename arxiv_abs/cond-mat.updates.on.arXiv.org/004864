The time evolution of a homogeneous bidisperse granular suspension is studied in the context of
the Enskog kinetic equation. The influence of the surrounding viscous gas on the solid particles
is modeled via a deterministic viscous drag force plus a stochastic Langevin-like term. It is found
first that, regardless of the initial conditions, the system reaches (after a transient period
lasting a few collisions per particle) a universal unsteady hydrodynamic regime where the distribution
function of each species not only depends on the dimensionless velocity (as in the homogeneous cooling
state) but also on the instantaneous temperature scaled with respect to the background temperature.
To confirm this result, theoretical predictions for the time-dependent partial temperatures
are compared against direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) results; the comparison shows an excellent
agreement confirming the applicability of hydrodynamics in granular suspensions. Also, in the
transient regime, the so-called Mpemba-like effect (namely, when an initially hotter sample cools
sooner than the colder one) is analyzed for inelastic collisions. The theoretical analysis of the
Mpemba effect is performed for initial states close to and far away from the asymptotic steady state.
In both cases, a good agreement is found again between theory and DSMC results. As a complement of
the previous studies, we determine in this paper the dependence of the steady values of the dynamic
properties of the suspension on the parameter space of the system. More specifically, we focus on
our attention in the temperature ratio $T_1/T_2$ and the fourth degree cumulants $c_1$ and $c_2$
(measuring the departure of the velocity distributions $f_1$ and $f_2$ from their Maxwellian forms).
Finally, a linear stability analysis of the steady state solution is also carried out showing that
the steady state is always linearly stable.

In condensed matter systems, higher temperatures typically disfavors ordered phases leading
to an upper critical temperature for magnetism, superconductivity, and other phenomena. A notable
exception is the Pomeranchuk effect in 3He, in which the liquid ground state freezes upon increasing
the temperature due to the large entropy of the paramagnetic solid phase. Here we show that a similar
mechanism describes the finite temperature dynamics of spin and valley-isospins in magic-angle
twisted bilayer graphene. Most strikingly a resistivity peak appears at high temperatures near
superlattice filling factor nu = -1, despite no signs of a commensurate correlated phase appearing
in the low-temperature limit. Tilted field magnetotransport and thermodynamic measurements
of the inplane magnetic moment show that the resistivity peak is adiabatically connected to a finite-field
magnetic phase transition at which the system develops finite isospin polarization. These data
are suggestive of a Pomeranchuk-type mechanism, in which the entropy of disordered isospin moments
in the ferromagnetic phase stabilizes it relative to an isospin unpolarized Fermi liquid phase
at elevated temperatures. Measurements of the entropy, S/kB indeed find it to be of order unity per
unit cell area, with a measurable fraction that is suppressed by an in-plane magnetic field consistent
with a contribution from disordered physical spins. In contrast to 3He, however, no discontinuities
are observed in the thermodynamic quantities across this transition. Our findings imply a small
isospin stiffness, with implications for the nature of finite temperature transport as well as
the mechanisms underlying isospin ordering and superconductivity in twisted bilayer graphene
and related systems.

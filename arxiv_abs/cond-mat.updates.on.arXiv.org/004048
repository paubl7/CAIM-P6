We investigate aspects of non-equilibrium dynamics of strongly coupled field theories within
holography. We establish a hydrodynamic description for anomalous quantum field theories subject
to a strong external field for the first time in the literature. Within holography, we explicitly
demonstrate which transport coefficients are non-zero due to the chiral anomaly and thus important
for the transport. We show that the standard treatment of the hydrodynamics for spontaneously broken
translational invariance is more subtle and has to be revised since the description is missing a
novel thermodynamic coefficient. Within holographic massive gravity, we lay out a road map for
extensions of hydrodynamics to momentum dissipation. Furthermore, we study the imprint of spontaneously
broken translations beyond linear response theory in terms of periodically driven strongly coupled
quantum field theories. Another important non-equilibrium scenario specially important for
the understanding of our universe is quantum gravity in de-Sitter. Recently, the bold claim of the
so-called swampland conjectures has attracted great interest since it banishes all stable theories
of quantum gravity on de-Sitter with matter into swampland. Within the well-defined framework
of the DS/dS correspondence, we set out to derive consistency conditions on the matter content in
de-Sitter. Surprisingly, our proposed bound is violated by any reasonable form of matter. In our
discussion, we find a novel one-parameter family of entangling surfaces. The last chapter is dedicated
to solvable irrelevant deformations in quantum field theory -- the $T\bar T$ deformation. Within
holography, we derive the entanglement entropies for generic subintervals on a sphere. We also
resolve the confusion in the literature about a seeming mismatch between the holographic field
theory results for the entanglement entropy in general dimensions.

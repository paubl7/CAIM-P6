Nanoparticles have become increasingly interesting for a wide range of applications, because
in principle it is possible to tailor their properties by controlling size, shape and composition.
One of these applications is heterogeneous catalysis, and a fundamental understanding of the structural
details of the nanoparticles is essential for any knowledge-based improvement of reactivity and
selectivity. In this work we investigate the atomic structure of brass nanoparticles containing
up to 5000 atoms as a typical example for a binary alloy consisting of Cu and Zn. As systems of this size
are too large for electronic structure calculations, in our simulations we use a recently parametrized
machine learning potential providing close to density functional theory accuracy. This potential
is employed for a structural characterization as a function of chemical composition by various
types of simulations like Monte Carlo in the Semi-Grand Canonical Ensemble and simulated annealing
molecular dynamics. Our analysis reveals that the distribution of both elements in the nanoparticles
is inhomogeneous, and zinc accumulates in the outermost layer, while the first subsurface layer
shows an enrichment of copper. Only for high zinc concentrations alloying can be found in the interior
of the nanoparticles, and regular patterns corresponding to crystalline bulk phases of $\alpha$-brass
can then be observed. The surfaces of the investigated clusters exhibit well-ordered single-crystal
facets, which can give rise to grain boundaries inside the clusters. The melting temperature of
the nanoparticles is found to decrease with increasing zinc-atom fraction, a trend which is well-known
also for the bulk phase diagram of brass.

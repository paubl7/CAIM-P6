We demonstrate a method to induce tensile and compressive strain into two-dimensional transition
metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) MoS$_{2}$ via the deposition of stressed thin films to encapsulate
exfoliated flakes. With this technique we can directly engineer MoS$_{2}$ strain magnitude by
changing deposited thin film stress, therefore allowing variable strain to be applied on a flake-to-flake
level. These thin film stressors are analogous to SiN$_{x}$ based stressors implemented in industrial
CMOS processes to enhance Si mobility, suggesting that our concept is highly scalable and may be
applied for large-scale integration of strain engineered TMDC devices. We choose optically transparent
stressors to allow us to probe MoS$_{2}$ strain through Raman spectroscopy. Combining thickness
dependent analyses of Raman peak shifts in MoS$_{2}$ with atomistic simulations, we can explore
layer-by-layer strain transfer. MoS$_{2}$ on conventional substrates (SiO$_{2}$, MgO) show
strain transfer into the top two layers of multilayer flakes with limited strain transfer to monolayers
due to substrate adhesion. To mitigate this limitation, we also explore stressors on van der Waals
heterostructures constructed of monolayer (1L) MoS$_{2}$ on hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN).
This concept frees the 1L-MoS$_{2}$ allowing for a 0.85$\%$ strain to be applied to the monolayer
with a corresponding strain induced bandgap change of 75 meV. By using thin films with higher stress,
strain may be engineered to be even higher. Various stressors and deposition methods are considered,
showing a stressor material independent transfer of strain that only depends on stressor film force
with negligible defects induced into MoS$_{2}$ when thermal evaporation is used.

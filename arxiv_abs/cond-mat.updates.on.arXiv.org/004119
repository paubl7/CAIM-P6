The steep climbing of victims caused by the new coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) throughout
the planet is sparking an unprecedented effort to identify effective therapeutic regimens to tackle
the pandemic. The SARS-CoV-2 virus is known to gain entry into various cell types through the binding
of one of its surface proteins (spike) to the host Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme 2 (ACE2). Thus,
spike-ACE2 interaction represents a major target for vaccines and antiviral drugs. A novel method
has been recently described by some of the authors to pharmacologically downregulate the expression
of target proteins at the post-translational level. This technology builds on computational advancements
in the simulation of folding mechanisms to rationally block protein expression by targeting folding
intermediates, hence hampering the folding process. Here, we report the all-atom simulations
of the entire sequence of events underlying the folding pathway of ACE2. Our data revealed the existence
of a folding intermediate showing two druggable pockets hidden in the native conformation. Both
pockets were targeted by a virtual screening repurposing campaign aimed at quickly identifying
drugs capable to decrease the expression of ACE2. We identified four compounds capable of lowering
ACE2 expression in Vero cells in a dose-dependent fashion. All these molecules were found to inhibit
the entry into cells of a pseudotyped retrovirus exposing the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Importantly,
the antiviral activity has been tested against live SARS-CoV-2 (MEX-BC2/2020 strain). One of the
selected drugs (Artefenomel) could completely prevent cytopathic effects induced by the presence
of the virus, thus showing antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2. Ongoing studies are further
evaluating the possibility of repurposing these drugs for the treatment of COVID-19.

The anomalous Hall, Nernst and thermal Hall coefficients of Fe$_{3-x}$GeTe$_2$ display several
features upon cooling, like a reversal in the Nernst signal below $T = 50$ K pointing to a topological
transition (TT) associated to the development of magnetic spin textures. Since the anomalous transport
variables are related to the Berry curvature, a possible TT might imply deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz
(WF) law. However, the anomalous Hall and thermal Hall coefficients of Fe$_{3-x}$GeTe$_2$ are
found, within our experimental accuracy, to satisfy the WF law for magnetic-fields $\mu_0H$ applied
along its inter-layer direction. Surprisingly, large anomalous transport coefficients are also
observed for $\mu_0H$ applied along the planar \emph{a}-axis as well as along the gradient of the
chemical potential, a configuration that should not lead to their observation due to the absence
of Lorentz force. However, as $\mu_0H$ $\|$ \emph{a}-axis is increased, magnetization and neutron
scattering indicate just the progressive canting of the magnetic moments towards the planes followed
by their saturation. These anomalous planar quantities are found to not scale with the component
of the planar magnetization ($M_{\|}$), showing instead a sharp decrease beyond $\sim \mu_0 H_{\|}
= $ 4 T which is the field required to align the magnetic moments along $\mu_0 H_{\|}$. We argue that
locally chiral spin structures, such as skyrmions, and possibly skyrmion tubes, lead to a field
dependent spin-chirality and hence to a novel type of topological anomalous transport. Locally
chiral spin-structures are captured by our Monte-Carlo simulations incorporating small Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya
and biquadratic exchange interactions.

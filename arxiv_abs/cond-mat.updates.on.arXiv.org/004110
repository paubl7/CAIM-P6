Understanding the dynamics of charge exchange between a solid surface and a liquid is fundamental
to various situations, ranging from nanofiltration to catalysis and electrochemistry. Charge
transfer is ultimately determined by physicochemical processes (surface group dissociation,
ion adsorption, etc...) occurring in the few layers of molecules at the interface between the solid
and the liquid. Unfortunately, these processes remain largely uncharted due to the experimental
challenges in probing interfacial charge dynamics with sufficiently high spatial and temporal
resolution. Here, we resolve at the single-charge scale, the dynamics of proton charges at the interface
between an hBN crystal and binary mixtures of water and organic amphiphilic solvents (e.g. alcohol),
evidencing a dramatic influence of solvation on interfacial dynamics. Our observations rely on
the application of spectral Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (sSMLM) to two types of optically
active defects at the hBN surface, which act as intrinsic optical markers for both surface protonation
and interaction with apolar alkyl groups of the organic solvent. We use sSMLM to reveal interfacial
proton charge transport as a succession of jumps between the titratable surface defects, mediated
by the transport of the solvated proton charge along the solid/liquid interface. By changing the
relative concentration of water in binary mixtures, we evidence a non-trivial effect on interfacial
proton charge dynamics, leading at intermediate water concentration to an increased affinity
of the proton charge to the solid surface, accompanied by an increased surface diffusivity. These
measurements confirm the strong role of solvation on interfacial proton charge transport and establish
the potential of single-molecule localization techniques to probe a wide range of dynamic processes
at solid/liquid interfaces.

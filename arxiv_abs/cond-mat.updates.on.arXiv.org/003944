It is widely believed that topological superconductivity, a hitherto elusive phase of quantum
matter, can be achieved by inducing superconductivity in topological materials. In search of such
topological superconductors, certain topological insulators (like, Bi$_2$Se$_3$) were successfully
turned into superconductors by metal-ion (Cu, Pd, Sr, Nb etc. ) intercalation. Superconductivity
could be induced in topological materials through applying pressure as well. for example, a pressure-induced
superconducting phase was found in the topological insulator Bi$_2$Se$_3$. However, in all such
cases, no conclusive signature of topological superconductivity was found. In this review, we
will discuss about another novel way of inducing superconductivity in a non-superconducting topological
material -- by creating a mesoscopic interface on the material with a non-superconducting, normal
metallic tip where the mesoscopic interface becomes superconducting. Such a phase is now known
as a tip-induced superconducting (TISC) phase. This was first seen in 2014 on Cd$_3$As$_2$ at IISER
Mohali, India. Following that, a large number of other topological materials were shown to display
TISC. Since the TISC phase emerges only at a confined region under a mesoscopic point contact, traditional
bulk tools for characterizing superconductivity cannot be employed to detect/confirm such a phase.
On the other hand, such a point contact geometry is ideal for probing the possible existence of a temperature
and magnetic field dependent superconducting energy gap and a temperature and magnetic field dependent
critical current. We will review the details of the experimental signatures that can be used to prove
the existence of superconductivity even when the "text-book" tests for detecting superconductivity
cannot be performed. Then, we will review different systems where a TISC phase could be realized.

$\beta$-\ce{Ga2O3} currently stands for the most attractive isomorph of gallium oxide polymorphs,
in view of the increasing number of potential applications especially in optoelectronics and photonics
for solar technology, as for instance in blind ultraviolet photodetectors solar cells (SBUV).
For its use in these applications, but also in the prospect of predicting novel possible features,
knowledge of its fundamental properties is paramount. Thus optical, thermal and electronic properties
of $\beta$-\ce{Ga2O3} have been studied expriementally giving evidence of a wide-band, inorganic
and transparent semiconductor with a Kerr nonlinearity. Thermo-optical properties of the material,
probed in photo-thermal SBUV sensing experiments, reveal a sizable heat diffusion characterized
by a temperature gradient along the path of optical beams, quadratic in beam position and promoting
a refractive-index change with temperature. The experimentally observed Kerr nonlinearity together
with the thermally induced birefringence, point unambiguously to a possible formation of soliton
molecules during propagation of high-intensity fields in $\beta$-\ce{Ga2O3}. To put this conjecture
on a firm ground we propose a theoretical analysis, based on the cubic nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation
in 1+1 spatial dimension, in which thermal lensing creates an effective potential quadratic in
beam position coordinate. Using the non-isospectral inverse-scattering transform method, the
exact one-soliton solution to the propagation equation is obtained. This solution features a bound
state of entangled pulses forming a soliton molecule, in which pulses are more or less entangled
depending on characteristic parameters of the system.

We investigated low-temperature dynamics in a charge density wave (CDW) conductor NbSe3, a widely
studied representative of a class of systems of driven periodic media with quenched disorder and
relevant to a wider group of systems exhibiting collective transport behaviors. To date, theoretical
efforts have not converged to produce a consistent description of the rich dynamics observed in
these systems, especially in the low temperature regime. We developed modern sample preparation
techniques and used frequency- and time-domain transport measurements below the second characteristic
Peierls CDW transition to investigate the regime of temporally-ordered collective creep in NbSe3
samples in the low temperature regime between 15 K and 32 K. By measuring the frequency of coherent
oscillations between two characteristic threshold fields, ET and ET*, we show that in nine high-quality
samples, pure, Ta-, or Ti-doped, the current-field relation for the collective transport in this
regime closely follows a modified Anderson-Kim form across five orders of magnitude with thermally-
and field-activated behavior above ET for a range of temperatures. This study, combined with our
transport relaxation measurements, provides relevant length, energy, and time scales that set
the dynamics in this regime and reveals that the collective dynamics, governed by large length and
energy scales, must be reconciled with microscopic local dynamics, with barriers at orders of magnitude
smaller scales. The interplay between the collective and local mechanisms set the dynamics that
is responsible for extremely slow (creep-like) collective, yet temporally-ordered behavior.
Combined with the existing work, our results paint a consistent picture of a transport phase diagram
for CDWs, and density-wave systems in general, and provide essential ingredients for a much-needed
correct theoretical description of these systems.

Halide perovskite light absorbers have great advantages for photovoltaics such as efficient solar
energy absorption, but charge accumulation and recombination at the interface with an electron
transport layer (ETL) remains a major challenge in realizing their full potential. Here we report
the experimental realization of a zipper-like interdigitated interface between a Pb-based halide
perovskite light absorber and an oxide ETL by the PbO capping of the ETL surface, which produces an
atomically thin two-dimensional metallic layer that can significantly enhance the perovskite/ETL
charge extraction process. As the atomistic origin of the emergent two-dimensional interfacial
metallicity, first-principles calculations performed on the representative MAPbI$_3$/TiO$_2$
interface identify the interfacial strain induced by the simultaneous formation of stretched
I-substitutional Pb bonds (and thus Pb-I-Pb bonds bridging MAPbI$_3$ and TiO$_2$) and contracted
substitutional Pb-O bonds. Direct and indirect experimental evidences for the presence of interfacial
metallic states are provided, and a non-conventional defect-passivating nature of the strained
interdigitated perovskite/ETL interface is emphasized. It is experimentally demonstrated that
the PbO capping method is generally applicable to other ETL materials including ZnO and SrTiO$_3$,
and that the zipper-like interdigitated metallic interface leads to about two-fold increase in
charge extraction rate. Finally, in terms of the photovoltaic efficiency, we observe a volcano-type
behavior with the highest performance achieved at the monolayer-level PbO capping. The method
established here might prove to be a general interface engineering approach to realize high-performance
perovskite solar cells.

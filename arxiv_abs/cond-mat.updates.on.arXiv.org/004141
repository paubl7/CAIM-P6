This is a PhD Thesis on the connection between subfactors (more precisely, their corresponding
fusion categories) and Conformal Field Theory (CFT). Besides being a mathematically interesting
topic on its own, subfactors have also attracted the attention of physicists, since there is a conjectured
correspondence between these and CFTs. Although there is quite a persuasive body of evidence for
this conjecture, there are some gaps: there exists a set of exceptional subfactors with no known
counterpart CFT. Hence, it is necessary to develop new techniques for building a CFT from a subfactor.
Here, it is useful to study the underlying mathematical structure in more detail: The even parts
of every subfactor give rise to two Unitary Fusion Categories (UFCs), and it is a promising direction
to study quantum spin systems constructed from these categories to find a connection to CFTs. The
simplest example that requires new techniques for building a CFT is the Haagerup subfactor, since
it is the smallest subfactor with index larger than 4. In this thesis, we investigate the question
whether there is a CFT corresponding to the Haagerup subfactor via lattice models in one and two dimensions.
The first task here is to find the F-symbols of the fusion category since these are crucial ingredients
for the construction of a physical model in all of the models we consider in this thesis. We then investigate
microscopic models such as the golden chain model and the Levin-Wen model in order to find evidence
for a corresponding CFT. We find that there is no evidence for a corresponding CFT from the investigation
of the UFCs directly and it is necessary to expand these studies to the corresponding unitary modular
tensor category, which can, for instance, be obtained via the excitations of the Levin-Wen model.

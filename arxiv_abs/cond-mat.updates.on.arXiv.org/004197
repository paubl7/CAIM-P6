For fundamentally characterizing the effect of hierarchical structure in granular matter, a set
of compression-relaxation tests for dust particles and glass beads confined in a cylindrical cell
was performed. Typical diameter of both grains is approximately 1~mm. However, dust particles
are produced by binding tiny ($\sim 5$~{\textmu}m) glass beads. The granular columns were compressed
with a piston until reaching a maximum load force of 20~N with a constant compression rate $v$ ($0.17
\leq v \leq 2000$~{\textmu}m~s$^{-1}$). After that, the piston was stopped and the relaxation
process was quantified. From the experimental results, we found that the compression force $F$
nonlinearly increases with the increase of compression stroke $z$ depending on particles. Besides,
periodic undulation and sudden force drops were observed on $F(z)$ in dust particles and glass beads,
respectively. The relaxation process was characterized by an exponential decay of stress followed
by a logarithmic dependence one in both kinds of particles. These experimental findings are the
main point in this study. To understand the underlying physics governing the compression mechanics,
we assumed empirical forms of $F(z)$; $F\propto z^{\alpha}$ for dust particles and $F \propto \exp(z/z_G)$
for glass beads ($\alpha=2.4$ and $z_G=70$~{\textmu}m). Then, we found that the growing manners
of periodic undulation and force drops were identical to those of mean compression forces, i.e.,
power law in dust particles and exponential in glass beads. In addition, the undulation amplitude
and wavelength decreased as $v$ increased in dust-particles compression. On the basis of experimental
results and the difference between dust particles and glass beads, we also discuss the origin of
undulation and the physical meaning of granular-compression models used in engineering fields.

Droplet states of ultracold gases which are stabilized by fluctuations have recently been observed
for dipolar and two component Bose gases. These systems present a novel form of equilibrium where
an instability at the mean field level is arrested by higher order correlations making the droplet
states sensitive probes of fluctuations. In a recent paper, we argued that thermal fluctuations
can play an important role for droplets even at low temperatures where the non-condensed density
is much smaller than the condensate density. We used the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory together
with local density approximation for fluctuations to obtain a generalized Gross Pitaevskii (GP)
equation and solved it with a Gaussian variational ansatz to show that the transition between the
low density and droplet states can be significantly modified by the temperature. In this paper,
we first solve the same GP equation numerically with a time splitting spectral method to check the
validity of the Gaussian variational ansatz. Our numerical results are in good agreement with the
Gaussian ansatz for a large parameter regime and show that the density of the gas is most strongly
modified by temperature near the abrupt transition between a pancake shaped cloud and the droplet.
For cigar shaped condensates, as in the recent Er experiments, the dependence of the density on temperature
remains quite small throughout the smooth transition. We then consider the effect of temperature
on the collective oscillation frequencies of the droplet using both a time dependent Gaussian variational
ansatz and real time numerical evolution. We find that the oscillation frequencies depend significantly
on the temperature close to the transition for the experimentally relevant temperature regime
($\simeq 100$nK).

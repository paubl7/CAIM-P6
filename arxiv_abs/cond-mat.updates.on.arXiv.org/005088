As first explained by the classic Asakura-Oosawa (AO) model, effective attractive forces between
colloidal particles induced by depletion of nonadsorbing polymers can drive demixing of colloid-polymer
mixtures into colloid-rich and colloid-poor phases, with practical relevance for purification
of water, stability of foods and pharmaceuticals, and macromolecular crowding in biological cells.
By idealizing polymer coils as effective penetrable spheres, the AO model qualitatively captures
the influence of polymer depletion on thermodynamic phase behavior of colloidal suspensions.
In previous work, we extended the AO model to incorporate aspherical polymer conformations and
showed that fluctuating shapes of random-walk coils can significantly modify depletion potentials
[W. K. Lim and A. R. Denton, Soft Matter 12, 2247 (2016); J. Chem. Phys. 144, 024904 (2016)]. We further
demonstrated that the shapes of polymers in crowded environments depend sensitively on solvent
quality [W. J. Davis and A. R. Denton, J. Chem. Phys. 149, 124901 (2018)]. Here we apply Monte Carlo
simulation to analyze the influence of solvent quality on depletion potentials in mixtures of hard
sphere colloids and nonadsorbing polymer coils, modeled as ellipsoids whose principal radii fluctuate
according to random-walk statistics. We consider both self-avoiding and non-self-avoiding random
walks, corresponding to polymers in good and theta solvents, respectively. Our simulation results
demonstrate that depletion of polymers of equal molecular weight induces much stronger attraction
between colloids in good solvents than in theta solvents and confirm that depletion interactions
are significantly influenced by aspherical polymer conformations.

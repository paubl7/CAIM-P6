Gold-assisted mechanical exfoliation currently represents a promising method to separate ultra-large
(cm-scale) transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) monolayers (1L) with excellent electronic
and optical properties from the parent van der Waals (vdW) crystals. The strong interaction between
$Au$ and chalcogen atoms is the key to achieve this nearly perfect 1L exfoliation yield. On the other
hand, it may affect significantly the doping and strain of 1L TMDs in contact with Au. In this paper,
we systematically investigated the morphology, strain, doping, and electrical properties of
large area 1L $MoS_{2}$ exfoliated on ultra-flat $Au$ films ($0.16-0.21 nm$ roughness) and finally
transferred to an insulating $Al_{2}O_{3}$ substrate. Raman mapping and correlative analysis
of the $E'$ and $A1'$ peaks positions revealed a moderate tensile strain ($0.2\%$) and p-type doping
($n=-0.25 \times 10^{13} cm^{-2}$) of 1L $MoS_{2}$ in contact with $Au$. Nanoscale resolution
current mapping and current-voltage (I-V) measurements by conductive atomic force microscopy
(C-AFM) showed direct tunnelling across the 1L $MoS_{2}$ on $Au$, with a broad distribution of tunnelling
barrier values (from 0.7 to 1.7 eV) consistent with the p-type doping of $MoS_{2}$. After the final
transfer of $1L-MoS_{2}$ on $Al_{2}O_{3}/Si$, the strain was converted to compressive ($-0.25\%$).
Furthermore, an n-type doping ($n=0.5 \times 10^{13} cm^{-2}$) was deduced by Raman mapping and
confirmed by electrical measurements of an $Al_{2}O_{3}/Si$ back-gated 1L $MoS_{2}$ transistor.
These results provide a deeper understanding of the $Au$-assisted exfoliation mechanisms and
can contribute to its widespread applications for the realization of novel devices and artificial
vdW heterostructures

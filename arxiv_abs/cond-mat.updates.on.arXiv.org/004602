Graphite is a ubiquitous electrode material with particular promise for use in e.g., energy storage
and desalination devices, but very little is known about the properties of the graphite-electrolyte
double layer at technologically relevant concentrations. Here, the (electrified) graphite-NaCl(aq)
interface was examined using constant chemical potential molecular dynamics simulations; this
approach avoids ion depletion (due to surface adsorption) and maintains a constant concentration
of ions beyond the surface. Specific Na+ adsorption at the graphite basal surface causes charging
of the interface in the absence of an applied potential. At moderate bulk concentrations, this leads
to accumulation of counter-ions in a diffuse layer to balance the effective surface charge, consistent
with established models of the electrical double layer (DL). Beyond 0.6 M, however, a combination
of over-screening and ion crowding in the DL results in alternating compact layers of ion density
perpendicular to the interface. The transition to this regime is marked by an increasing DL size
and anomalous negative shifts to the potential of zero charge with incremental changes to the bulk
concentration. Our observations are supported by changes to the position of the differential capacitance
minimum measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. Furthermore, a striking level of
agreement between the differential capacitance from simulations and experiments allows us to
critically assess the accepted norm that electrochemical capacitance measurements report simply
on the density of states of the graphite material. Finally, ion crowding at the highest concentrations
(beyond 5 M) leads to the formation of liquid-like NaCl clusters confined to highly non-ideal regions
of the double layer, where ion diffusion is up to five times slower than in the bulk.

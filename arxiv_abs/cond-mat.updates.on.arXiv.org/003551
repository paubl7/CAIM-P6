We systematically study Lorentz symmetry extensions in quantum field theories (QFTs) and their
't Hooft anomalies via cobordism. The total symmetry $G'$ can be expressed in terms of the extension
of Lorentz symmetry $G_L$ by an internal global symmetry $G$ as $1 \to G \to G' \to G_L \to 1$. By enumerating
all possible $G_L$ and symmetry extensions, other than the familiar SO/Spin/O/Pin$^{\pm}$ groups,
we introduce a new EPin group (in contrast to DPin), and provide natural physical interpretations
to exotic groups E($d$), EPin($d$), (SU(2)$\times$E(d))/$\mathbb{Z}_2$, (SU(2)$\times$EPin(d))/$\mathbb{Z}_2^{\pm}$,
etc. By Adams spectral sequence, we systematically classify all possible $d$d Symmetry Protected
Topological states (SPTs as invertible TQFTs) and $(d-1)$d 't Hooft anomalies of QFTs by co/bordism
groups and invariants in $d\leq 5$. We further gauge the internal $G$, and study Lorentz symmetry-enriched
Yang-Mills theory with discrete theta terms given by gauged SPTs. We not only enlist familiar bosonic
Yang-Mills but also discover new fermionic Yang-Mills theories (when $G_L$ contains a graded fermion
parity $\mathbb{Z}_2^F$), applicable to bosonic (e.g., Quantum Spin Liquids) or fermionic (e.g.,
electrons) condensed matter systems. For a pure gauge theory, there is a one form symmetry $I_{[1]}$
associated with the center of the gauge group $G$. We further study the anomalies of the emergent
symmetry $I_{[1]}\times G_L$ by higher cobordism invariants as well as QFT analysis. We focus on
the simply connected $G=$SU(2) and briefly comment on non-simply connected $G=$SO(3), U(1), other
simple Lie groups, and Standard Model gauge groups (SU(3)$\times$SU(2)$\times$U(1))/$\mathbb{Z}_q$.
We comment on SPTs protected by Lorentz symmetry, and the symmetry-extended trivialization for
their boundary states.

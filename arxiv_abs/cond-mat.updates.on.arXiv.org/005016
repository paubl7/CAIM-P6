Assemblies of closely separated gold nanoparticles exhibit a strong collective plasmonic response
due to coupling of the plasmon modes of the individual nanostructures. In the context of self-assembly
of nanoparticles, closed packed 2D clusters of spherical nanoparticles present an important composite
system that promises numerous applications. The present study probes the collective plasmonic
characteristics and resulting photothermal behavior of closed packed 2D Au nanoparticle clusters
in order to delineate the effects of cluster size, inter-particle distance and particle size. Smaller
nanoparticles (20 nm and 40 nm in diameter) that exhibit low individual scattering and high absorption
were considered for their relevance to photothermal applications. In contrast to typical literature
studies, the present study compares the optical response of clusters of different sizes ranging
from a single nanoparticle up to large assemblies of 61 nanoparticles. Increasing the cluster size
induces significant changes to the spectral position and opto-physical characteristics. Based
on the model outcome, an optimal cluster size for maximum absorption per nanoparticle is also determined
for enhanced photothermal effects. The effect of particle size and inter-particle distance is
investigated in order to elucidate the nature of interaction in terms of near-field and far-field
coupling. The photothermal effect resulting from absorption is compared for different cluster
sizes and inter-particle distances considering a homogeneous water medium. A strong dependence
of the steady state temperature of the nanoparticles on the cluster size, particle position in the
cluster, incident light polarization and inter-particle distance provides new physical insight
in local temperature control of plasmonic nanostructures.

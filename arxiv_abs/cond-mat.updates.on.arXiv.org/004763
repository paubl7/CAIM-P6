Controlling thermal energy transfer at the nanoscale has become critically important in many applications
and thermal properties since it often limits device performance. In this work, we study the effects
on thermal conductivity arising from the nanoscale structure of free-standing nanocrystalline
silicon films and the increasing surface-to-volume ratio when fabricated into suspended optomechanical
nanobeams. We characterize thermal transport in structures with different grain sizes and elucidate
the relative impact of grain size and geometrical dimensions on thermal conductivity. We use a micro-time-domain
thermoreflectance method to study the impact of the grain size distribution, from 10 to 400 nm, on
the thermal conductivity in free-standing nanocrystalline silicon films considering surface
phonon and grain boundary scattering. We find a drastic reduction in the thermal conductivity,
down to values of 10 W.m^{-1}.K^{-1} and below, which is just a fraction of the conductivity of single
crystalline silicon. Decreasing the grain size further decreases the thermal conductivity. We
also observe that this effect is smaller in OM nanostructures than in membranes due to the competition
of surface scattering in decreasing thermal conductivity. Finally, we introduce a novel versatile
contactless characterization technique that can be adapted to any structure supporting a thermally
shifted optical resonance and use it to evaluate the thermal conductivity. This method can be used
with optical resonances exhibiting different mode profiles and the data is shown to agrees quantitatively
with the thermoreflectance measurements. This work opens the way to a more generalized thermal
characterization of optomechanical cavities and to create hot-spots with engineered shapes at
desired position in the structures as a means to study thermal transport in coupled photon-phonon
structures.

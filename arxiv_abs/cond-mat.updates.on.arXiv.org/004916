We have theoretically studied the spin structure factors of Heisenberg model on honeycomb lattice
in the presence of longitudinal magnetic field, i.e. magnetic field perpendicular to the honeycomb
plane, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. The possible effects of next nearest neighbor
exchange constant are investigated in terms of anisotropy in the Heisenberg interactions. This
spatial anisotropy is due to the difference between nearest neighbor exchange coupling constant
and next nearest neighbor exchange coupling constant. The original spin model hamiltonian is mapped
to a bosonic model via a hard core bosonic transformation where an infinite hard core repulsion is
imposed to constrain one boson occupation per site. Using Green's function approach, the energy
spectrum of quasiparticle excitation has been obtained. The spectrum of the bosonic gas has been
implemented in order to obtain two particle propagator which corresponds to spin structure factor
of original Heisenberg chain model Hamiltonian. The results show the position of peak in the dynamical
transverse spin structure factor at fixed value for Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction moves to
higher frequency with magnetic field. Also the intensity of dynamical transverse spin structure
factor is not affected by magnetic field. However the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction strength
causes to decrease the intensity of dynamical transverse spin structure factor. The increase of
magnetic field does not varied the frequency position of peaks in dynamical longitudinal spin susceptibility
however the intensity reduces with magnetic field. Our results show static transverse structure
factor is found to be monotonically decreasing with magnetic field and temperature for different
vlaues of next nearest neighbor coupling exchange constant.

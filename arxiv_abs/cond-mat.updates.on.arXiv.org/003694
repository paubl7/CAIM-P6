Manipulating the way in which colloidal particles self-organise is a central principle in the design
and realisation of contemporary soft matter materials. The design of complex structures via self-organisation
requires the use of building blocks that interact with one another in a highly specific manner. The
fabrication of such building blocks is however often inhibited by the complexity of the currently
available synthesis procedures. Here we demonstrate, by using easily accessible magnetic colloids,
that we can create a variety of building blocks suitable for hierarchical self-organisation.Using
computer simulations, we have investigated the suitability of magnetic colloids, spherical and
cubic in shape, to form small clusters with reproducible structural and magnetic properties. Cluster
formation was driven by the compression of colloids within spherical confinement. We find that,
while the structure of these clusters is highly reproducible, their magnetic character is dependent
on the shape of the constituent magnetic particles. Cubic particle shape frustrates the minimisation
of the cluster energy, resulting in variations of the resulting cluster's magnetic configuration.
Spherical particles, however, have the rotational degrees of freedom to produce equivalent magnetic
configurations more readily. Building upon these results, we validate the ability of magnetic
trimers to form hierarchical assemblies, proving that the spherical magnetic particles presented
here can offer a route to effectively design a viable approach for novel self-assembly processes.
Understanding how the geometry of the constituent particles determines the final magnetic properties
of the clusters, provides an effective way to construct building blocks suitable for the next level
of hierarchical assembly.

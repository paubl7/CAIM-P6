Simulation of reasonable timescales for any long physical process using molecular dynamics (MD)
is a major challenge in computational physics. In this study, we have implemented an approach based
on multi-fidelity physics informed neural network (MPINN) to achieve long-range MD simulation
results over a large sample space with significantly less computational cost. The fidelity of our
present multi-fidelity study is based on the integration timestep size of MD simulations. While
MD simulations with larger timestep produce results with lower level of accuracy, it can provide
enough computationally cheap training data for MPINN to learn an accurate relationship between
these low-fidelity results and high-fidelity MD results obtained using smaller simulation timestep.
We have performed two benchmark studies, involving one and two component LJ systems, to determine
the optimum percentage of high-fidelity training data required to achieve accurate results with
high computational saving. The results show that important system properties such as system energy
per atom, system pressure and diffusion coefficients can be determined with high accuracy while
saving 68% computational costs. Finally, as a demonstration of the applicability of our present
methodology in practical MD studies, we have studied the viscosity of argon-copper nanofluid and
its variation with temperature and volume fraction by MD simulation using MPINN. Then we have compared
them with numerous previous studies and theoretical models. Our results indicate that MPINN can
predict accurate nanofluid viscosity at a wide range of sample space with significantly small number
of MD simulations. Our present methodology is the first implementation of MPINN in conjunction
with MD simulation for predicting nanoscale properties. This can pave pathways to investigate
more complex engineering problems that demand long-range MD simulations.

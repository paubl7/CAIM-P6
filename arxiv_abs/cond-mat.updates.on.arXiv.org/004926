Disordered hyperuniform systems are exotic states of matter that completely suppress large-scale
density fluctuations like crystals, and yet possess no Bragg peaks similar to liquids or glasses.
Such systems have been discovered in a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium physical and
biological systems, and are often endowed with novel physical properties. The mechanisms associated
with the emergence of disordered hyperuniformity in nonequilibrium systems, in particular inherent
structures are often not well understood, which we will address from a topological perspective
in this work. Specifically, we consider a representative class of disordered inherent structures
which are constructed by continuously introducing randomly distributed topological defects
(dislocations and disclinations) often seen in colloidal systems and atomic-scale two-dimensional
materials. We demonstrate that these inherent structures can be viewed as topological variants
of ordered hyperuniform states (such as crystals) linked through continuous topological transformation
pathways, which remarkably preserve hyperuniformity. Moreover, we develop a continuum theory
to demonstrate that the large-scale density fluctuations in these inherent structures are mainly
dominated by the elastic displacement fields resulted from the topological defects, which at low
defect concentrations can be approximated as superposition of the displacement fields associated
with each individual defect (strain source). We rigorously demonstrate that hyperuniformity
is preserved as long as certain conditions associated with the displacement fields are met. Our
results also highlight the importance of decoupling the positional degrees of freedom from the
vibrational degrees of freedom when looking for disordered hyperuniformity, since the hyperuniformity
property is often cloaked by thermal fluctuations.

Mean-field theory is an approximation replacing an extended system by a few variables. For depinning
of elastic manifolds, these are the position of its center of mass $u$, and the statistics of the forces
$F(u)$. There are two proposals to model the latter: as a random walk (ABBM model), or as uncorrelated
forces at integer $u$ (discretized particle model, DPM). While for many experiments ABBM (in the
literature misleadingly equated with mean-field theory) makes quantitatively correct predictions,
the microscopic disorder force-force correlations cannot grow linearly, and thus unboundedly
as a random walk. Even the effective (renormalized) disorder forces which do so at small distances
are bounded at large distances. We propose to model forces as an Ornstein Uhlenbeck process. The
latter behaves as a random walk at small scales, and is uncorrelated at large ones. By connecting
to results in both limits, we solve the model largely analytically, allowing us to describe in all
regimes the distributions of velocity, avalanche size and duration. To establish experimental
signatures of this transition, we study the response function, and the correlation function of
position $u$, velocity $\dot u$ and forces $F$ under slow driving with velocity $v>0$. While at $v=0$
force or position correlations have a cusp at the origin, this cusp is rounded at a finite driving
velocity. We give a detailed analytic analysis for this rounding by velocity, which allows us, given
experimental data, to extract the time-scale of the response function, and to reconstruct the force-force
correlator at $v=0$. The latter is the central object of the field theory, and as such contains detailed
information about the universality class in question. We test our predictions by careful numerical
simulations extending over up to ten orders in magnitude.

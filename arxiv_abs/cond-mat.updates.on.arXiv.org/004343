Recent experiments [J. Guo et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.124,206602 (2020)] on thermodynamic properties
of the frustrated layered quantum magnet SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ -- the Shastry-Sutherland material
-- have provided strong evidence for a low-temperature phase transition between plaquette-singlet
and antiferromagnetic order as a function of pressure. Further motivated by the recently discovered
unusual first-order quantum phase transition with an apparent emergent O(4) symmetry of the antiferromagnetic
and plaquette-singlet order parameters in a two-dimensional "checkerboard J-Q" quantum spin
model [B. Zhao et al., Nat. Phys. 15, 678 (2019)], we here study the same model in the presence of weak
inter-layer couplings. Our focus is on the evolution of the emergent symmetry as the system crosses
over from two to three dimensions and the phase transition extends from strictly zero temperature
in two dimensions up to finite temperature as expected in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$. Using quantum
Monte Carlo simulations, we map out the phase boundaries of the plaquette-singlet and antiferromagnetic
phases, with particular focus on the triple point where these two order phases meet the paramagnetic
phase for given strength of the inter-layer coupling. All transitions are first-order in the neighborhood
of the triple points. We show that the emergent O(4) symmetry of the coexistence state breaks down
clearly when the interlayer coupling becomes sufficiently large, but for a weak coupling, of the
magnitude expected experimentally, the enlarged symmetry can still be observed at the triple point
up to significant length scales. Thus, it is likely that the plaquette-singlet to antiferromagnetic
transition in SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$ exhibits remnants of emergent O(4) symmetry, which should
be observable due to additional weakly gapped Goldstone modes.

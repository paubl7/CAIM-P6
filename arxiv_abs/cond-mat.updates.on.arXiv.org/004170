Urban street networks of unplanned or self-organized cities typically exhibit astonishing scale-free
patterns. This scale-freeness can be shown, within the maximum entropy formalism (MaxEnt), as
the manifestation of a fluctuating system that preserves on average some amount of information.
Monte Carlo methods that can further this perspective are cruelly missing. Here we adapt to self-organized
urban street networks the Metropolis algorithm. The "coming to equilibrium" distribution is established
with MaxEnt by taking scale-freeness as prior hypothesis along with symmetry-conservation arguments.
The equilibrium parameter is the scaling; its concomitant extensive quantity is, assuming our
lack of knowledge, an amount of information. To design an ergodic dynamics, we disentangle the state-of-the-art
street generating paradigms based on nonoverlapping walks into layout-at-junction dynamics.
Our adaptation reminisces the single-spin-flip Metropolis algorithm for Ising models. We thus
expect Metropolis simulations to reveal that self-organized urban street networks, besides sustaining
scale-freeness over a wide range of scalings, undergo a crossover as scaling varies -- literature
argues for a small-world crossover. Simulations for Central London are consistent against the
state-of-the-art outputs over a realistic range of scaling exponents. Our illustrative Watts-Strogatz
phase diagram with scaling as rewiring parameter demonstrates a small-world crossover curving
within the realistic window 2-3; it also shows that the state-of-the-art outputs underlie relatively
large worlds. Our Metropolis adaptation to self-organized urban street networks thusly appears
as a scaling variant of the Watts-Strogatz model. Such insights may ultimately allow the urban profession
to anticipate self-organization or unplanned evolution of urban street networks.

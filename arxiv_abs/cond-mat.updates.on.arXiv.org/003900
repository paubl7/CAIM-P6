Manipulating materials with atomic-scale precision is essential for the development of next-generation
material design toolbox. Tremendous efforts have been made to advance the compositional, structural,
and spatial accuracy of material deposition and patterning. The family of 2D materials provides
an ideal platform to realize atomic-level material architectures. The wide and rich physics of
these materials have led to fabrication of heterostructures, superlattices, and twisted structures
with breakthrough discoveries and applications. Here, we report a novel atomic-scale material
design tool that selectively breaks and forms chemical bonds of 2D materials at room temperature,
called atomic-layer substitution (ALS), through which we can substitute the top layer chalcogen
atoms within the 3-atom-thick transition-metal dichalcogenides using arbitrary patterns. Flipping
the layer via transfer allows us to perform the same procedure on the other side, yielding programmable
in-plane multi-heterostructures with different out-of-plane crystal symmetry and electric
polarization. First-principle calculations elucidate how the ALS process is overall exothermic
in energy and only has a small reaction barrier, facilitating the reaction to occur at room temperature.
Optical characterizations confirm the fidelity of this design approach, while TEM shows the direct
evidence of Janus structure and suggests the atomic transition at the interface of designed heterostructure.
Finally, transport and Kelvin probe measurements on MoXY (X,Y=S,Se; X and Y corresponding to the
bottom and top layers) lateral multi-heterostructures reveal the surface potential and dipole
orientation of each region, and the barrier height between them. Our approach for designing artificial
2D landscape down to a single layer of atoms can lead to unique electronic, photonic and mechanical
properties previously not found in nature.

Germanium telluride (GeTe), a phase-change material, is known to exhibit four different structural
phases: three at room temperature (one amorphous and two crystalline, $\alpha$ and $\gamma$) and
one at high temperature (crystalline $\beta$). Because transitions between the amorphous and
crystalline phases lead to significant changes in material properties (e.g., refractive index
and resistivity), GeTe has been investigated as a phase-change material for photonics, thermoelectrics,
ferroelectrics, and spintronics. Consequently, the temperature-dependent phase transitions
in GeTe have been studied for bulk and thin-film GeTe, both fabricated by sputtering. Colloidal
synthesis of nanoparticles offers a more flexible fabrication approach for amorphous and crystalline
GeTe. These nanoparticles are known to exhibit size-dependent properties, such as an increased
crystallization temperature for the amorphous-to-$\alpha$ transition in sub-10\,nm GeTe particles.
The $\alpha$-to-$\beta$ phase transition is also expected to vary with size, but this effect has
not yet been investigated for GeTe. Here, we report time-resolved X-ray diffraction of GeTe nanoparticles
with different diameters and from different synthetic protocols. We observe a non-volatile amorphous-to-$\alpha$
transition between 210$^{\circ}$C and 240$^{\circ}$C and a volatile $\alpha$-to-$\beta$ transition
between 370$^{\circ}$C and 420$^{\circ}$C. The latter transition was reversible and repeatable.
While the transition temperatures are shifted relative to the values known for bulk GeTe, the nanoparticle-based
samples still exhibit the same structural phases reported for sputtered GeTe. Thus, colloidal
GeTe maintains the same general phase behavior as bulk GeTe while allowing for more flexible and
accessible fabrication. Therefore, nanoparticle-based GeTe films show great potential for applications,
such as in active photonics.

Topological phases exhibit unconventional order that cannot be detected by any local order parameter.
In the framework of Projected Entangled Pair States(PEPS), topological order is characterized
by an entanglement symmetry of the local tensor which describes the model. This symmetry can take
the form of a tensor product of group representations, or in the more general case a correlated symmetry
action in the form of a Matrix Product Operator(MPO), which encompasses all string-net models.
Among other things, these entanglement symmetries allow for the description of ground states and
anyon excitations. Recently, the idea has been put forward to use those symmetries and the anyonic
objects they describe as order parameters for probing topological phase transitions, and the applicability
of this idea has been demonstrated for Abelian groups. In this paper, we extend this construction
to the domain of non-Abelian models with MPO symmetries, and use it to study the breakdown of topological
order in the double Fibonacci (DFib) string-net and its Galois conjugate, the non-hermitian double
Yang-Lee (DYL) string-net. We start by showing how to construct topological order parameters for
condensation and deconfinement of anyons using the MPO symmetries. Subsequently, we set up interpolations
from the DFib and the DYL model to the trivial phase, and show that these can be mapped to certain restricted
solid on solid(RSOS) models, which are equivalent to the $((5\pm\sqrt{5})/2)$-state Potts model,
respectively. The known exact solutions of the statistical models allow us to locate the critical
points, and to predict the critical exponents for the order parameters. We complement this by numerical
study of the phase transitions, which fully confirms our theoretical predictions; remarkably,
we find that both models exhibit a duality between the order parameters for condensation and deconfinement.

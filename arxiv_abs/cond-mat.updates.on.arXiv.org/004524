Hybrid perovskites with mixed organic cations such as methylammonium and formamidinium have attracted
interest due to their improved stability and capability to tune their properties varying the composition.
In this work we report on the local variation of the structural and electronic properties in mixed
A-site cation MA/FA lead iodide perovskites FAXMA1-XPBI3 evaluated from static first-principles
calculations in certain structures where the orientations of organic cations result from examining
the energy landscape of some compositions. The cation replacement at the A-site to form the solid
solution causes an increase tilting of the inorganic PbI6 octahedra: in the FA-rich compounds the
replacement of FA by a smaller cation like MA is to compensate the reduced space filling offered by
the smaller cation, whereas in the MA-rich compounds is to expand the space needed for the larger
cation. In fact, the effect of octahedron tiltings exceeds that of unit-cell size in determining
the band gap for these organic cation mixtures. Our calculations indicate that the key role played
by hydrogen bonds with iodine anions in pure compounds is preserved in the cation mixed perovskites.
It is found that MA-I bonds remain stronger than FA-I bonds throughout the composition range regardless
of the unit-cell expansion as the FA content increases. Our calculations reveal how the hydrogen
bonds stabilize the no-bonding I-5p orbitals, spatially perpendicular to the Pb-I-Pb bond axis,
lowering their energy when the H-I interaction occurs, which would explain the well-known role
of hydrogen bonding in the structural stabilization of hybrid perovskites. These results contribute
to the understanding on the role played by cation mixing at A sites in the physics of lead halide perovskites.

The Eilenberger equation is a standard tool in the description of superconductors with an arbitrary
degree of disorder. It can be generalized to systems with linear-in-momentum spin-orbit coupling
(SOC), by exploiting the analogy of SOC with a non-abelian background field. Such field mixes singlet
and triplet components and yields the rich physics of magnetoelectric phenomena. In this work we
show that the application of this equation extends further, beyond superconductivity. In the normal
state, the linearized Eilenberger equation describes the coupled spin-charge dynamics. Moreover,
its resolvent corresponds to the so called Cooperons, and can be used to calculate the weak localization
corrections. Specifically, we show how to solve this equation for any source term and provide a closed-form
solution for the case of Rashba SOC. We use this solution to address several problems of interest
for spintronics and superconductivity. Firstly, we study spin injection from ferromagnetic electrodes
in the normal state, and describe the spatial evolution of spin density in the sample, and the complete
crossover from the diffusive to the ballistic limit. Secondly, we address the so-called superconducting
Edelstein effect, and generalize the previously known results to arbitrary disorder. Thirdly,
we study weak localization correction beyond the diffusive limit, which can be a valuable tool in
experimental characterization of materials with very strong SOC. We also address the so-called
pure gauge case where the persistent spin helices form. Our work establishes the linearized Eilenberger
equation as a powerful and a very versatile method for the study of materials with spin-orbit coupling,
which often provides a simpler and more intuitive picture compared to alternative methods.

Although the behavior of fluid-filled vesicles in steady flows has been extensively studied, far
less is understood regarding the shape dynamics of vesicles in time-dependent oscillatory flows.
Here, we investigate the nonlinear dynamics of vesicles in large amplitude oscillatory extensional
(LAOE) flows using both experiments and boundary integral (BI) simulations. Our results characterize
the transient membrane deformations, dynamical regimes, and stress response of vesicles in LAOE
in terms of reduced volume (vesicle asphericity), capillary number ($\Ca$, dimensionless flow
strength), and Deborah number ($\De$, dimensionless flow frequency). Results from single vesicle
experiments are found to be in good agreement with BI simulations across a wide range of parameters.
Our results reveal three distinct dynamical regimes based on vesicle deformation: pulsating,
reorienting, and symmetrical regimes. We construct phase diagrams characterizing the transition
of vesicle shapes between pulsating, reorienting, and symmetrical regimes within the two-dimensional
Pipkin space defined by $\De$ and $\Ca$. Contrary to observations on clean Newtonian droplets,
vesicles do not reach a maximum length twice per strain rate cycle in the reorienting and pulsating
regimes. The distinct dynamics observed in each regime result from a competition between the flow
frequency, flow time scale, and membrane deformation timescale. By calculating the particle stresslet,
we quantify the nonlinear relationship between average vesicle stress and strain rate. Additionally,
we present results on tubular vesicles that undergo shape transformation over several strain cycles.
Broadly, our work provides new information regarding the transient dynamics of vesicles in time-dependent
flows that directly informs bulk suspension rheology.

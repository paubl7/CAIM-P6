The widespread use of sodium aluminosilicate glass in many engineering applications due to its
mechanical and optical properties (transparency, dielectric, etc.), has become common in recent
years. However, glass, a brittle material, has its vulnerability to fracture. Processes such as
heat treatment (heat tempering) or chemical strengthening through ion-exchange have been used
to create residual stress profiles on the glass, in a bid to improve its fracture strength. However,
failure still occurs, which is mostly catastrophic and expensive to repair. Therefore understanding,
predicting, and eventually improving the resistance to damage or fracture of chemically strengthened
glass is important to designing new glasses that would be tougher while retaining their transparency.
The relationship between the glass residual stress parameters such as the compressive stress (CS),
depth of compression layer (DOL), and central tension (CT) versus apparent (effective) fracture
toughness for different crack depth was investigated in this study using a Silicon Carbide particle
blast plus ring-on-ring (RoR) test method. The results also showed that improving the fracture
resistance of glass via chemical strengthening requires a proper combination of CS, DOL, and CT,
which is particularly dependent on the initial/existing crack (flaw) depth. It was determined
that for a damage event involving the introduction of a shallow crack depth, the criterion for optimal
resistance to fracture, in terms of apparent fracture toughness, is weighted more towards a high
CS, than deep DOL while for a deep flaw damage event, it is more weighted towards deep DOL, than a high
CS. These results provide a valuable piece of information in the design of a more robust glass in engineering
applications.

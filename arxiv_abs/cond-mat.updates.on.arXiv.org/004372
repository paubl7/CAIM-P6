The study of complex oxides and oxide heterostructures have dominated the field of experimental
and theoretical condensed matter research for the better part of the last few decades. Powerful
experimental techniques like molecular beam epitaxy and pulsed laser deposition have made fabrication
of oxide heterostructures with atomically sharp interfaces possible, while more and more sophisticated
handling of exchange and correlations within first principles methods including density functional
theory (DFT) supplemented with Hubbard U corrections and hybrid functionals, and beyond DFT techniques
like dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) have made understanding of such correlated oxides and oxide
interfaces easier. The emergence of the high mobility two dimensional electron gas with fascinating
properties like giant photoconductance, large negative magnetoresistance, superconductivity,
ferromagnetism, and the mysterious coexistence of the latter two have indeed caught the attention
of condensed matter community at large. Similarly strain tuning of oxides have generated considerable
interest particularly after the recent discovery of piezoelectric methods of strain generation.
Theoretical understanding and prediction of the possible exotic phases emerging in such complex
oxides both under strain and in heterostructures will eventually lead to better design of device
applications in this new emerging field of oxide electronics, along with possible discovery of
exotic physics in condensed matter systems which may be of wider significance! In this review we
briefly look at theoretical studies of novel phenomena in oxides under strain and oxide heterostructures,
and try to understand the role of exchange and particularly correlation in giving rise to such exotic
electronic states.

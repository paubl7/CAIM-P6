A generic semiclassical superconducting nanostructure connected to multiple superconducting
terminals hosts a quasi-continuous spectrum of Andreev states. The spectrum is sensitive to the
superconducting phases of the terminals. It can be either gapped or gapless depending on the point
in the multi-dimensional parametric space of these phases. Special points in this space correspond
to setting some terminals to the phase 0 and the rest to the phase of $\pi$. For a generic nanostructure,
three distinct spectra come together in the vicinity of a special point: two gapped phases of different
topology and a gapless phase separating the two by virtue of topological protection. In this paper,
we show that a weak interaction manifesting as quantum fluctuations of superconducting phases
drastically changes the spectrum in a narrow vicinity of a special point. We develop an interaction
model and derive a universal generic quantum action that describes this situation. The action is
complicated by incorporating a non-local in time matrix order parameter, and its full analysis
is beyond the scope of the present paper. Here, we identify and address two limits: the semiclassical
one and the quantum one, concentrating on the first-order interaction correction in the last case.
In both cases, we find that the interaction squeezes the domain of the gapless phase in the narrow
vicinity of the point so the gapped phases tend to contact each other immediately, defying the topological
protection. We identify the domains of strong coupling where the perturbation theory does not work.
In the gapless phase, we find the logarithmic divergence of the first-order corrections. This leads
us to an interesting hypothesis: weak interaction might induce an exponentially small gap in the
formerly gapless phase.

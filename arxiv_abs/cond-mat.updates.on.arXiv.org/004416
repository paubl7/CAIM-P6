We present a detailed comparison of the rheological behaviour of sheared sediment beds in a pressure-driven,
straight channel configuration based on data that was generated by means of fully coupled, grain-resolved
direct numerical simulations and experimental measurements reviously published by Aussillous
{\it et al.} (J. Fluid Mech., vol. 736, 2013, pp. 594-615). The highly-resolved simulation data
allows to compute the stress balance of the suspension in the streamwise and vertical directions
and the stress exchange between the fluid and particle phase, which is information needed to infer
the rheology, but has so far been unreachable in experiments. Applying this knowledge to the experimental
and numerical data, we obtain the statistically-stationary, depth-resolved profiles of the relevant
rheological quantities. The scaling behavior of rheological quantities such as the shear and normal
viscosities and the effective friction coefficient are examined and compared to data coming from
rheometry experiments and from widely-used rheological correlations. We show that rheological
properties that have previously been inferred for annular Couette-type shear flows with neutrally
buoyant particles still hold for our setup of sediment transport in a Poiseuille flow and in the dense
regime we found good agreement with empirical relationships derived therefrom. Subdividing the
total stress into parts from particle contact and hydrodynamics suggests a critical particle volume
fraction of 0.3 to separate the dense from the dilute regime. In the dilute regime, i.e., the sediment
transport layer, long-range hydrodynamic interactions are screened by the porous media and the
effective viscosity obeys the Einstein relation.

Quantum many-body systems are characterized by patterns of correlations that define highly-non
trivial manifolds when interpreted as data structures. Physical properties of phases and phase
transitions are typically retrieved via simple correlation functions, that are related to observable
response functions. Recent experiments have demonstrated capabilities to fully characterize
quantum many-body systems via wave-function snapshots, opening new possibilities to analyze
quantum phenomena. Here, we introduce a method to data mine the correlation structure of quantum
partition functions via their path integral (or equivalently, stochastic series expansion) manifold.
We characterize path-integral manifolds generated via state-of-the-art Quantum Monte Carlo
methods utilizing the intrinsic dimension (ID) and the variance of distances from nearest neighbors
(NN): the former is related to dataset complexity, while the latter is able to diagnose connectivity
features of points in configuration space. We show how these properties feature universal patterns
in the vicinity of quantum criticality, that reveal how data structures {\it simplify} systematically
at quantum phase transitions. This is further reflected by the fact that both ID and variance of NN-distances
exhibit universal scaling behavior in the vicinity of second-order and Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless
critical points. Finally, we show how non-Abelian symmetries dramatically influence quantum
data sets, due to the nature of (non-commuting) conserved charges in the quantum case. Complementary
to neural network representations, our approach represents a first, elementary step towards a
systematic characterization of path integral manifolds before any dimensional reduction is taken,
that is informative about universal behavior and complexity, and can find immediate application
to both experiments and Monte Carlo simulations.

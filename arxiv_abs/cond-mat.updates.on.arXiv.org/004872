Recent experiments and simulations of amorphous solids plastically deformed by oscillatory drive
have foundsurprising behavior - for small strain amplitudes the dynamics can be reversible, which
is contrary to the usual notion of plasticity as an irreversible form of deformation. This reversibility
allows the system to reach limit-cycles in which plastic events repeat indefinitely under the oscillatory
drive. Reaching reversible limit-cycles, can take a large number of driving cycles and it was surmised
that the plastic events encountered during the transient period are not encountered again and are
thus irreversible. Using a graph representation of the stable configurations of the system and
the plastic events connecting them, we show that the notion of reversibility is more subtle. We find
that reversible plastic events are abundant, and that a large portion of the plastic events encountered
during the transient period are actually reversible, in the sense that they can be part of a reversible
deformation path. We observe that the transition graph can be decomposed into clusters of configurations
that are connected by reversible transitions. These clusters are the strongly connected components
of the graph and their sizes turn out to be power-law distributed. The largest of these are grouped
in regions of reversibility, which in turn are confined by regions of irreversibility whose number
proliferates at larger strains. Our results provide an explanation for the irreversibility transition
- the divergence of the transient period at a critical forcing amplitude. Long transients result
from transition between clusters of reversibility in a search for a cluster large enough to contain
a limit-cycle of a specific amplitude. For large enough amplitudes, the search time becomes very
large, since sizes of the limit cycles become incompatible with the sizes of the regions of reversibility.

The Kovacs effect is a remarkable feature of the ageing dynamics of glass forming liquids near the
glass transition temperature. It consists in a non-monotonous evolution of the volume/enthalpy
after a succession of two abrupt temperature changes: first from a high initial temperature $T_i$
to a much lower annealing temperature $T_a$ followed by a smaller second jump back to a slightly higher
final temperature $T_f$. The second change is performed when the instantaneous value of the volume/enthalpy
coincides with the equilibrium one at the final temperature at $t_a$. While this protocol might
be expected to yield equilibrium dynamics right after the second temperature change, one observes
the so-called Kovacs hump in glassy systems. In this paper we apply such thermal protocol to the Distinguishable
Particles Lattice Model (DPLM) for a wide range of fragility of the system. We study the Kovacs hump
based on energy relaxation and all main experimental features are captured. Results are compared
to general predictions based on a master equation approach in the linear response limit. We trace
the origin of the Kovacs hump to the non-equilibrium nature of the probability distribution of particle
interaction energies after the annealing and find that its difference with respect to the final
equilibrium distribution is non-vanishing with two isolated zeros. This allows Kovacs' condition
of equilibrium total energy to be met out-of-equilibrium thus representing the memory content
of the system. Furthermore, the hump is taller and occurs at a larger overlap with the system initial
configuration for more fragile systems. The dynamics of a structural temperature for the mobile
regions strongly depends on the glass fragility while for the immobile ones only a weak dependence
is found.

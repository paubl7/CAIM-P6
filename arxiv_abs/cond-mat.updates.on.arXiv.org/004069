In this work we theoretically explore the effect of dimensionality on the thermoelectric power
factor of InAs nanowires by coupling atomistic tight-binding calculations to the Linearized Boltzmann
transport formalism. We consider nanowires with diameters from 40nm (bulk-like) down to 3nm (1D),
which allows for the proper exploration of the power factor within a unified large-scale atomistic
description across a large diameter range. We find that as the diameter of the nanowires is reduced
below d < 10 nm, the Seebeck coefficient increases substantially, a consequence of strong subband
quantization. Under phonon-limited scattering conditions, a considerable improvement of ~6x
in the power factor is observed around d = 10 nm. The introduction of surface roughness scattering
in the calculation reduces this power factor improvement to ~2x. As the diameter is decreased down
to d = 3 nm, the power factor is diminished. Our results show that, although low effective mass materials
such as InAs can reach low-dimensional behavior at larger diameters and demonstrate significant
thermoelectric power factor improvements, surface roughness is also stronger at larger diameters,
which takes most of the anticipated power factor advantages away. However, the power factor improvement
that can be observed around d = 10 nm, could prove to be beneficial as both the Lorenz number and the
phonon thermal conductivity are reduced at that diameter. Thus, this work, by using large-scale
full-band simulations that span the corresponding length scales, clarifies properly the reasons
behind power factor improvements (or degradations) in low-dimensional materials. The elaborate
computational method presented can serve as a platform to develop similar schemes for 2D and 3D material
electronic structures.

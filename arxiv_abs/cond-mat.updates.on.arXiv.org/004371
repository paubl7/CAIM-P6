When an electron passes through a chiral molecule there is a high probability for a correlation between
the momentum and spin of the charge, thus leading to spin polarized current. This phenomenon is known
as the chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect. One of the most surprising experimental results
recently demonstrated is that magnetization reversal in a ferromagnet (FM) with perpendicular
anisotropy can be realized solely by chemisorbing a chiral molecular monolayer without applying
any current or external magnetic field. This result raises the currently open question of whether
this effect is due to the bonding event, held by the ferromagnet, or a long timescale effect stabilized
by exchange interactions. In this work we have performed vectorial magnetic field measurements
of the magnetization reorientation of a ferromagnetic layer exhibiting perpendicular anisotropy
due to CISS using nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond, and followed the time dynamics of this effect.
In parallel, we have measured the molecular monolayer tilt angle in order to find a correlation between
the time dependence of the magnetization re-orientation and the change of the tilt angle of the molecular
monolayer. We have identified that changes in the magnetization direction correspond to changes
of the molecular monolayer tilt angle, providing evidence for a long-timescale characteristic
of the induced magnetization reorientation. This suggests that the CISS effect has an effect over
long-timescales which we attribute to exchange interactions. These results offer significant
insights into the fundamental processes underlying the CISS effect, contributing to the implementation
of CISS in state-of-the-art applications such as spintronic and magnetic memory devices.

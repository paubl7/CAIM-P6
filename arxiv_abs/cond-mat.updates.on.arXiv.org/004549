In sharp contrast to molecular synthesis, materials synthesis is generally presumed to lack selectivity.
The few known methods of designing selectivity in solid-state reactions have limited scope, such
as topotactic reactions or strain stabilization. This contribution describes a general approach
for searching large chemical spaces to identify selective reactions. This novel approach explains
the ability of a nominally "innocent" Na$_2$CO$_3$ precursor to enable the metathesis synthesis
of single-phase Y$_2$Mn$_2$O$_7$ -- an outcome that was previously only accomplished at extreme
pressures and which cannot be achieved with closely related precursors of Li$_2$CO$_3$ and K$_2$CO$_3$.
By calculating the required change in chemical potential across all possible reactant-product
interfaces in an expanded chemical space including Y, Mn, O, alkali metals, and halogens, using
thermodynamic parameters obtained from density functional theory calculations, we identify
reactions that minimize the thermodynamic competition from intermediates. In this manner, only
the Na-based intermediates minimize the distance in the hyperdimensional chemical potential
space to Y$_2$Mn$_2$O$_7$, thus providing selective access to a phase which was previously thought
to be metastable. Experimental evidence validating this mechanism for pathway-dependent selectivity
is provided by intermediates identified from in situ synchrotron-based crystallographic analysis.
This approach of calculating chemical potential distances in hyperdimensional compositional
spaces provides a general method for designing selective solid-state syntheses that will be useful
for gaining access to metastable phases and for identifying reaction pathways that can reduce the
synthesis temperature, and cost, of technological materials.

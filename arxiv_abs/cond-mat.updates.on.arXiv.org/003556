Hund metals have attracted attention in recent years due to their unconventional superconductivity,
which supposedly originates from non-Fermi-liquid (NFL) properties of the normal state. When
studying Hund metals using dynamical mean-field theory, one arrives at a self-consistent "Hund
impurity problem" involving a multiorbital quantum impurity with nonzero Hund coupling interacting
with a metallic bath. If its spin and orbital degrees of freedom are screened at different energy
scales, $T_\mathrm{sp} < T_\mathrm{orb}$, the intermediate energy window is governed by a novel
NFL fixed point, whose nature had not yet been clarified. We resolve this problem by providing an
analytical solution of a paradigmatic example of a Hund impurity problem, involving two spin and
three orbital degrees of freedom. To this end, we combine a state-of-the-art implementation of
the numerical renormalization group, capable of exploiting non-Abelian symmetries, with a generalization
of Affleck and Ludwig's conformal field theory (CFT) approach for multichannel Kondo models. We
characterize the NFL fixed point of Hund metals in detail for a Kondo model with an impurity forming
an SU(2)$\times$SU(3) spin-orbital multiplet, tuned such that the NFL energy window is very wide.
The impurity's spin and orbital susceptibilities then exhibit striking power-law behavior, which
we explain using CFT arguments. We find excellent agreement between CFT predictions and numerical
renormalization group results. Our main physical conclusion is that the regime of spin-orbital
separation, where orbital degrees of freedom have been screened but spin degrees of freedom have
not, features anomalously strong local spin fluctuations: the impurity susceptibility increases
as $\chi_\mathrm{sp}^\mathrm{imp} \sim \omega^{-\gamma}$, with $\gamma > 1$.

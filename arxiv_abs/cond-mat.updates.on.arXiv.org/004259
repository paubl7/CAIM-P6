This paper is a continuation and a partial summary of our analysis of the pairing at a quantum-critical
point (QCP) in a metal for a set of quantum-critical systems, whose low-energy physics is described
by an effective model with dynamical electron-electron interaction $V(\Omega_m) = ({\bar g}/|\Omega_m|)^\gamma$
(the $\gamma$-model). Examples include pairing at the onset of various spin and charge density-wave
and nematic orders and pairing in SYK-type models. In previous papers, we analyzed the physics for
$\gamma <2$. We have shown that the onset temperature for the pairing $T_p$ is finite, of order ${\bar
g}$, yet the gap equation at $T=0$ has an infinite set of solutions within the same spatial symmetry.
As the consequence, the condensation energy $E_c$ has an infinite number of minima. The spectrum
of $E_c$ is discrete, but becomes more dense as $\gamma$ increases. Here we consider the case $\gamma
=2$. The $\gamma=2$ model attracted special interest in the past as it describes the pairing by an
Einstein phonon in the limit when the dressed phonon mass $\omega_D$ vanishes. We show that for $\gamma
=2$, the spectrum of $E_c$ becomes continuous. We argue that the associated gapless "longitudinal"
fluctuations destroy superconducting phase coherence at a finite $T$, such that at $0<T< T_p$ the
system displays pseudogap behavior. We show that for each gap function from the continuum spectrum,
there is an infinite array of dynamical vortices in the upper half-plane of frequency. For the electron-phonon
case at a finite $\omega_D$, our results show that $T_p =0.1827 {\bar g}$, obtained in earlier studies,
marks the onset of the pseudogap behavior, while the actual superconducting $T_c$ scales with $\omega_D$
and vanishes at $\omega_D \to 0$.

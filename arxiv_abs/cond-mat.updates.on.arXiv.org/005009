Since the discovery of high temperature superconductivity in cuprates, Josephson junction based
phase-sensitive experiments are believed and used to provide the most convincing evidence for
determining the pairing symmetry. Regardless of different junction materials and geometries
used, quantum tunneling involved in these experiments is essentially a nanoscale process, and
thus, actual experimental results are extremely sensitive to atomic details of the junction structures.
The situation has led to controversial results as to the nature of the pairing symmetry of cuprates:
while in-plane junction experiments generally support $d$-wave pairing symmetry, those based
on out-of-plane ($c$-axis) Josephson junctions between two rotated cuprate blocks favor $s$-wave
pairing. In this work, we revisit the $c$-axis experiment by fabricating Josephson junctions with
atomic-level control in their interface structure. We fabricate over 90 junctions of ultrathin
Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ (BSCCO) flakes by state-of-the-art exfoliation technique and
obtain atomically flat junction interfaces in the whole junction regions as characterized by high
resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Notably, the resultant uniform junctions
at various twist angles all exhibit a single tunneling branch behavior, suggesting that only the
first half a unit cell on both sides of the twisted flakes is involved in Josephson tunneling process.
With such well-defined geometry/structure and the characteristic single tunneling branch, we
repeatedly observe Josephson tunneling at a nominal twist angle of 45 degrees, which is against
the expectation from a purely $d$-wave pairing scenario. Our results strongly favor the scenario
of a persistent $s$-wave order parameter in the junction.

The pentakis dodecahedron, the dual of the truncated icosahedron, consists of 60 edge-sharing
triangles. It has 20 six- and 12 five-fold coordinated vertices, with the former forming a dodecahedron,
and each of the latter connected to the vertices of one of the 12 pentagons of the dodecahedron. When
spins mounted on the vertices of the pentakis dodecahedron interact according to the nearest-neighbor
antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, the two different vertex types necessitate the introduction
of two exchange constants. As the relative strength of the two constants is varied the molecule interpolates
between the dodecahedron and a molecule consisting only of quadrangles. The competition between
the two exchange constants, frustration, and an external magnetic field results in a multitude
of ground-state magnetization and susceptibility discontinuities. At the classical level the
maximum is ten magnetization and one susceptibility discontinuities when the 12 five-fold vertices
interact with the dodecahedron spins with approximately one-half the strength of their interaction.
When the two interactions are approximately equal in strength the number of discontinuities is
also maximized, with three of the magnetization and eight of the susceptibility. At the full quantum
limit, where the magnitude of the spins equals 1/2, there can be up to three ground-state magnetization
jumps that have the total z spin component changing by \Delta S^z=2, even though quantum fluctuations
rarely allow discontinuities of the magnetization. The full quantum case also supports a \Delta
S^z=3 discontinuity. Frustration also results in nonmagnetic states inside the singlet-triplet
gap. These results make the pentakis dodecahedron the molecule with the most discontinuous magnetic
response from the quantum to the classical level.

Recent years have enjoyed an overwhelming interest in quantum thermodynamics, a field of research
aimed at understanding thermodynamic tasks performed in the quantum regime. Further progress,
however, seems to be obstructed by the lack of experimental implementations of thermal machines
in which quantum effects play a decisive role. In this work, we introduce a blueprint of quantum field
machines, which - once experimentally realized - would fill this gap. Even though the concept of
the QFM presented here is very general and can be implemented in any many body quantum system that
can be described by a quantum field theory. We provide here a detailed proposal how to realize a quantum
machine in one-dimensional ultra-cold atomic gases, which consists of a set of modular operations
giving rise to a piston. These can then be coupled sequentially to thermal baths, with the innovation
that a quantum field takes up the role of the working fluid. In particular, we propose models for compression
on the system to use it as a piston, and coupling to a bath that gives rise to a valve controlling heat
flow. These models are derived within Bogoliubov theory, which allows us to study the operational
primitives numerically in an efficient way. By composing the numerically modelled operational
primitives we design complete quantum thermodynamic cycles that are shown to enable cooling and
hence giving rise to a quantum field refrigerator. The active cooling achieved in this way can operate
in regimes where existing cooling methods become ineffective. We describe the consequences of
operating the machine at the quantum level and give an outlook of how this work serves as a road map
to explore open questions in quantum information, quantum thermodynamic and the study of non-Markovian
quantum dynamics.

Spreading processes on networks are ubiquitous in both human-made and natural systems. Understanding
their behavior is of broad interest; from the control of epidemics to understanding brain dynamics.
While in some cases there exists a clear separation of time scales between the propagation of a single
spreading cascade and the initiation of the next -- such that spreading can be modelled as directed
percolation or a branching process -- there are also processes for which this is not the case, such
as zoonotic diseases or spiking cascades in neural networks. For a large class of relevant network
topologies, we show here that in such a scenario the nature of the overall spreading fundamentally
changes. This change manifests itself in a transition between different universality classes
of critical spreading, which determines the onset and the properties of an avalanche turning epidemic
or neural activity turning epileptic, for example. We present analytical results in the mean-field
limit giving the critical line along which scale-free spreading behaviour can be observed. The
two limits of this critical line correspond to the universality classes of directed and undirected
percolation, respectively. Outside these two limits, this duality manifests itself in the appearance
of critical exponents from the universality classes of both directed and undirected percolation.
We find that the transition between these exponents is governed by a competition between merging
and propagation of activity, and identify an appropriate scaling relationship for the transition
point. Finally, we show that commonly used measures, such as the branching ratio and dynamic susceptibility,
fail to establish criticality in the absence of time-scale separation calling for a reanalysis
of criticality in the brain.

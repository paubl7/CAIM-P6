Several modern technologies for energy storage and conversion are based on the screening of electric
charge on the surface of porous electrodes by ions in an adjacent electrolyte. This so-called electric
double layer (EDL) exhibits an intricate interplay with the electrolyte's temperature that was
the focus of several recent studies. In one of them, Janssen et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 119, 166002 (2017)]
experimentally determined the ratio $\mathcal{Q}_\text{rev}/W_\text{el}$ of reversible eat
flowing into a supercapacitor during an isothermal charging process and the electric work applied
therein. To rationalize that data, here, we determine $\mathcal{Q}_\text{rev}/W_\text{el}$
within different models of the EDL using theoretical approaches like density functional theory
(DFT) as well as molecular dynamics simulations. Applying mainly the restricted primitive model,
we find quantitative support for a speculation of Janssen et al. that steric ion interactions are
key to the ratio $\mathcal{Q}_\text{rev}/W_\text{el}$. Here, we identified the entropic contribution
of certain DFT functionals, which grants direct access to the reversible heat. We further demonstrate
how $\mathcal{Q}_\text{rev}/W_\text{el}$ changes when calculated in different thermodynamic
ensembles and processes. We show that the experiments of Janssen et al. are explained best by a charging
process at fixed bulk density, or in a ``semi-canonical'' system. Finally, we find that $\mathcal{Q}_\text{rev}/W_\text{el}$
significantly depends on parameters as pore and ion size, salt concentration, and valencies of
the cat- and anions of the electrolyte. Our findings can guide further heat production measurements
and can be applied in studies on, for instance, nervous conduction, where reversible heat is a key
element.

The envisioned existence of an excitonic-insulator phase in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ has attracted a remarkable
interest in this material. The origin of the phase transition in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ has been rationalized
in terms of crystal symmetries breaking driven by both electronic correlation and lattice distortion.
However, the role of structural and electronic effects has yet to be disentangled. Meanwhile its
complementary material Ta$_2$NiS$_5$, which has the chalcogen species exchanged with Sulfur,
does not show any experimental evidence of an excitonic insulating phase. Here we present a microscopic
investigation of the electronic and phononic effects involved in the structural phase transition
in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ and Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ by means of extensive first-principles calculations for
both the high temperature orthorhombic and low-temperature monoclinic crystal phases. We show
that, despite the difference in electronic behaviour, the structural origin of the phase transition
is the same in the two crystals. In particular our first-principles results suggest, that the high
temperature phase of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ is metallic and the structural transition to the low-temperature
phase leads to the opening of an electronic gap. By analysing the phononic modes of the two phases
we single out the mode responsible for the structural transition and demonstrate how this phonon
mode strongly couples to the electronic structure. We demonstrate that, despite the very similar
phononic behaviour, in Ta$_2$NiS$_5$ the electronic transition from metal to semiconductor is
lacking and the crystal remains a semiconductor in both phases. To disentangle the effect of electronic
correlation, we calculate electronic bandstructures with increasing accuracy in the electron-electron
interaction and find that the structural transition alone allows for the metal to semiconductor
phase transition, ...

The layered perovskite YBaCuFeO5 (YBCFO) is considered one of the best candidates to high-temperature
chiral multiferroics with strong magnetoelectric coupling. In RBaCuFeO5 perovskites (R: rare-earth
or Y) A-site cations are fully ordered whereas their magnetic properties strongly depend on the
preparation process. They exhibit partial cationic disorder at the B-site that generates a magnetic
spiral stabilized through directionally assisted long range coupling between canted locally
frustrated spins. Moreover the orientation of its magnetic spiral can be critical for the magnetoelectric
response of this chiral magnetic oxide. We have synthesized and studied YBaCuFe1-xMnxO5 samples
doped with Mn, with the aim of increasing spin-orbit coupling effects, and found that the overall
Fe/Cu cation disorder at the B-sites can be increased by doping without changing the sample preparation
process. In YBaCuFe1-xMnxO5 samples prepared under the same conditions, the T-x magnetic phase
diagram have been constructed in the range 10K-500K combining magnetometry, X-ray and neutron
powder diffraction measurements. The tilting angles of the spins in the collinear, {\theta}col
, and spiral phases, {\theta}spiral, barely vary with temperature. In the collinear phase {\theta}col
is also independent of the Mn content. In contrast, the presence of Mn produces a progressive reorientation
of the plane of the magnetic helix in the incommensurate phase, capable to transform the helicoidal
spin ordering into a cycloidal one, which may critically determine the ferroelectric and magnetoelectric
behavior in these compounds. Some of the observations are of interest for engineering and developing
this family of potential high-temperature multiferroics.

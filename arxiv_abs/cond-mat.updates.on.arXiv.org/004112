Fe$_{1+x}$Te is a two dimensional van der Waals antiferromagnet that becomes superconducting
on anion substitution on the Te site. The parent phase of Fe$_{1+x}$Te is sensitive to the amount
of interstitial iron situated between the iron-tellurium layers displaying collinear magnetic
order coexisting with low temperature metallic resistivity for small concentrations of interstitial
iron $x$ and helical magnetic order for large values of $x$. While this phase diagram has been established
through scattering [see for example E. E. Rodriguez $\textit{et al.}$ Phys. Rev. B ${\bf{84}}$,
064403 (2011) and S. R\"ossler $\textit{et al.}$ Phys. Rev. B ${\bf{84}}$, 174506 (2011)], recent
scanning tunnelling microscopy measurements [C. Trainer $\textit{et al.}$ Sci. Adv. ${\bf{5}}$,
eaav3478 (2019)] have observed a different magnetic structure for small interstitial iron concentrations
$x$ with a significant canting of the magnetic moments along the crystallographic $c$ axis of $\theta$=28
$\pm$ 3$^{\circ}$. In this paper, we revisit the magnetic structure of Fe$_{1.09}$Te using spherical
neutron polarimetry and scanning tunnelling microscopy to search for this canting in the bulk phase
and compare surface and bulk magnetism. The results show that the bulk magnetic structure of Fe$_{1.09}$Te
is consistent with collinear in-plane order ($\theta=0$ with an error of $\sim$ 5$^{\circ}$).
Comparison with scanning tunnelling microscopy on a series of Fe$_{1+x}$Te samples reveals that
the surface exhibits a magnetic surface reconstruction with a canting angle of the spins of $\theta=29.8^{\circ}$.
We suggest that this is a consequence of structural relaxation of the surface layer resulting in
an out-of-plane magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The magnetism in Fe$_{1+x}$Te displays different
properties at the surface when the symmetry constraints of the bulk are removed.

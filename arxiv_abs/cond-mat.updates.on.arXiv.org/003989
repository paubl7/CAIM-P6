We examine the Fermi-surface effect called the nesting effect for the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov
(FFLO) state in strongly Pauli-limited quasi-two-dimensional superconductors,focusing on
the effect of three-dimensional factors, such as interlayer electron transfer, interlayer pairing,
and off-plane magnetic fields including those perpendicular to the most conductive layers (hereinafter
called the perpendicular fields). It is known that the nesting effect for the FFLO state can be strong
in quasi-low-dimensional systems in which the orbital pair-breaking effect is suppressed by applying
the magnetic field parallel to the layers. Hence, it has sometimes been suggested that it may not
work for perpendicular fields. We illustrate that, contrary to this view, the nesting effect can
strongly stabilize the FFLO state for perpendicular fields as well as for parallel fields when t_z
is small so that the Fermi surfaces are open in the k_z-direction, where t_z denotes the interlayer
transfer energy. In particular, the nesting effect in perpendicular fields can be strong in interlayer
states. For example, in systems with cylindrical Fermi surfaces warped by t_z /= 0, interlayer states
with Delta_{k} propto sin k_z exhibit mu_e H_c approx 1.65 Delta_{alpha 0} for perpendicular fields,
which is much larger than typical values for parallel fields, such as mu_e H_c = Delta_s0 of the s-wave
state and mu_e H_c approx 1.28 Delta_d0 of the d-wave state in cylindrical systems with t_z = 0. Here,
mu_e and H_c are the electron magnetic moment and upper critical field of the FFLO state at T = 0, respectively,
and Delta_{alpha 0} = 2 omega_c e^{- 1/lambda_alpha. We discuss the possible relevance of the nesting
effect to the high-field superconducting phases in perpendicular fields observed in the compounds
CeCoIn_5 and FeSe, which are candidates for the FFLO state.

In the last decade, quantum simulators, and in particular cold atoms in optical lattices, have emerged
as a valuable tool to study strongly correlated quantum matter. These experiments are now reaching
regimes that are numerically difficult or impossible to access. In particular they have started
to fulfill a promise which has contributed significantly to defining and shaping the field of cold
atom quantum simulations, namely the exploration of doped and frustrated quantum magnets and the
search for the origins of high-temperature superconductivity in the fermionic Hubbard model.
Despite many future challenges lying ahead, such as the need to further lower the experimentally
accessible temperatures, remarkable studies have already emerged. Among them, spin-charge separation
in one-dimensional systems has been demonstrated, extended-range antiferromagnetism in two-dimensional
systems has been observed, connections to modern day large-scale numerical simulations were made,
and unprecedented comparisons with microscopic trial wavefunctions have been carried out at finite
doping. In many regards, the field has acquired new realms, putting old ideas to a new test and producing
new insights and inspiration for the next generation of physicists. In the first part of this paper,
we review the results achieved in cold atom realizations of the Fermi-Hubbard model in recent years.
In the second part of this paper, with the stage set and the current state of the field in mind, we propose
a new direction for cold atoms to explore: namely mixed-dimensional bilayer systems, where the
charge motion is restricted to individual layers which remain coupled through spin-exchange.
We propose a novel, strong pairing mechanism in these systems, which puts the formation of hole pairs
at experimentally accessible, elevated temperatures within reach.

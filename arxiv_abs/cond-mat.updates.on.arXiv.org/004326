We provide a perspective on polymer glass formation, with an emphasis on models in which the fluid
entropy and collective particle motion dominate the theoretical description and data analysis.
We first discuss the dynamics of liquids in the high temperature Arrhenius regime, where transition
state theory is formally applicable. We then summarize the evolution of the entropy theory from
a qualitative framework for organizing and interpreting temperature-dependent viscosity data
by Kauzmann to the formulation of a hypothetical `ideal thermodynamic glass transition' by Gibbs
and DiMarzio, followed by seminal measurements linking entropy and relaxation by Bestul and Chang
and the Adam-Gibbs (AG) model of glass formation rationalizing the observations of Bestul and Chang.
These developments laid the groundwork for the generalized entropy theory (GET), which merges
an improved lattice model of polymer thermodynamics accounting for molecular structural details
and enabling the analytic calculation of the configurational entropy with the AG model, giving
rise to a highly predictive model of the segmental structural relaxation time of polymeric glass-forming
liquids. The development of the GET has occurred in parallel with the string model of glass formation
in which concrete realizations of the cooperatively rearranging regions are identified and quantified
for a wide range of polymeric and other glass-forming materials. The string model has shown that
many of the assumptions of AG are well supported by simulations, while others are certainly not,
giving rise to an entropy theory of glass formation that is largely in accord with the GET. As the GET
and string models continue to be refined, these models progressively grow into a more unified framework,
and this Perspective reviews the present status of development of this promising approach to the
dynamics of polymeric glass-forming liquids.

We propose a new metric called s-LID based on the concept of Local Intrinsic Dimensionality to identify
and quantify hierarchies of kinematic patterns in heterogeneous media. s-LID measures how outlying
a grain's motion is relative to its s nearest neighbors in displacement state space. To demonstrate
the merits of s-LID over the conventional measure of strain, we apply it to data on individual grain
motions in a set of deforming granular materials. Several new insights into the evolution of failure
are uncovered. First, s-LID reveals a hierarchy of concurrent deformation bands that prevails
throughout loading history. These structures vary not only in relative dominance but also spatial
and kinematic scales. Second, in the nascent stages of the pre-failure regime, s-LID uncovers a
set of system-spanning, criss-crossing bands: microbands for small s and embryonic-shearbands
at large s, with the former being dominant. At the opposite extreme, in the failure regime, fully
formed shearbands at large s dominate over the microbands. The novel patterns uncovered from s-LID
contradict the common belief of a causal sequence where a subset of microbands coalesce and/or grow
to form shearbands. Instead, s-LID suggests that the deformation of the sample in the lead-up to
failure is governed by a complex symbiosis among these different coexisting structures, which
amplifies and promotes the progressive dominance of the embryonic-shearbands over microbands.
Third, we probed this transition from the microband-dominated regime to the shearband-dominated
regime by systematically suppressing grain rotations. We found particle rotation to be an essential
enabler of the transition to the shearband-dominated regime. When grain rotations are completely
suppressed, this transition is prevented: microbands and shearbands coexist in relative parity.

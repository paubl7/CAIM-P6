Recent advances in scanning tunneling and transmission electron microscopies (STM and STEM) have
allowed routine generation of large volumes of imaging data containing information on the structure
and functionality of materials. The experimental data sets contain signatures of long-range phenomena
such as physical order parameter fields, polarization and strain gradients in STEM, or standing
electronic waves and carrier-mediated exchange interactions in STM, all superimposed onto scanning
system distortions and gradual changes of contrast due to drift and/or mis-tilt effects. Correspondingly,
while the human eye can readily identify certain patterns in the images such as lattice periodicities,
repeating structural elements, or microstructures, their automatic extraction and classification
are highly non-trivial and universal pathways to accomplish such analyses are absent. We pose that
the most distinctive elements of the patterns observed in STM and (S)TEM images are similarity and
(almost-) periodicity, behaviors stemming directly from the parsimony of elementary atomic structures,
superimposed on the gradual changes reflective of order parameter distributions. However, the
discovery of these elements via global Fourier methods is non-trivial due to variability and lack
of ideal discrete translation symmetry. To address this problem, we develop shift-invariant variational
autoencoders (shift-VAE) that allow disentangling characteristic repeating features in the
images, their variations, and shifts inevitable for random sampling of image space. Shift-VAEs
balance the uncertainty in the position of the object of interest with the uncertainty in shape reconstruction.
This approach is illustrated for model 1D data, and further extended to synthetic and experimental
STM and STEM 2D data.

Strong connection between the single-particle and collective excitations stands out as one of
the features of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs). We discuss theoretically these excitations
of BECs focusing on the exact properties of the one-body and two-body Green's functions developed
by Gavoret and Nozi\`eres. We also investigate these excitations by using the many-body approximation
theory at nonzero temperatures. First, we revisited the earlier study presented by Gavoret and
Nozi\`eres, involving the subsequent results given by Nepomnyashchii and Nepomnyashchii, in
terms of the matrix formalism representation. This formalism is an extension of the Nambu representation
for the single-particle Green's function of BECs to discuss the density and current response functions
efficiently. We describe the exact low-energy properties of the correlation functions and the
vertex functions, and discuss the correspondence of the spectra between the single-particle and
density excitations in the low-energy and low-momentum limits at $T=0$. After deriving the exact
low-energy structures of the one-body and two-body Green's functions, we develop a many-body approximation
theory of BECs using the matrix formalism for describing the single-particle Green's function
and the density response function at nonzero temperatures. We show how the peaks of the single-particle
spectral function and the density response function behave with an increasing temperature. Many-body
effect on the single-particle spectral function and the density response function is included
within a random phase approximation, where satellite structures emerge because of beyond-mean-field
effects. Criticisms are also made on recent theories casting doubt upon the conventional wisdom
of the BEC: the equivalence of the dispersion relations between the single-particle and collective
excitations in the low-energy and low-momentum regime.

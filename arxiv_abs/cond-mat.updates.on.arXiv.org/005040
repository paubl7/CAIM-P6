Silica-based optical fibers are a workhorse of nonlinear optics. They have been used to demonstrate
nonlinear phenomena such as solitons and self-phase modulation. Since the introduction of the
photonic crystal fiber, they have found many exciting applications, such as supercontinuum white
light sources and third-harmonic generation, among others. They stand out by their low loss, large
interaction length, and the ability to engineer its dispersive properties, which compensate for
the small chi(3) nonlinear coefficient. However, they have one fundamental limitation: due to
the amorphous nature of silica, they do not exhibit second-order nonlinearity, except for minor
contributions from surfaces. Here, we demonstrate significant second-harmonic generation in
functionalized optical fibers with a monolayer of highly nonlinear MoS2 deposited on the fiber
guiding core. The demonstration is carried out in a 3.5 mm short piece of exposed core fiber, which
was functionalized in a scalable process CVD-based process, without a manual transfer step. This
approach is scalable and can be generalized to other transition metal dichalcogenides and other
waveguide systems. We achieve an enhancement of more than 1000x over a reference sample of equal
length. Our simple proof-of-principle demonstration does not rely on either phase matching to
fundamental modes, or ordered growth of monolayer crystals, suggesting that pathways for further
improvement are within reach. Our results do not just demonstrate a new path towards efficient in-fiber
SHG-sources, instead, they establish a platform with a new route to chi(2)-based nonlinear fiber
optics, optoelectronics, and photonics platforms, integrated optical architectures, and active
fiber networks.

The Landau-Lifshitz equation governing magnetization dynamics is written in terms of the amplitudes
of normal modes associated with the micromagnetic system's appropriate ground state. This results
in a system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations, the right-hand side of which can be expressed
as the sum of a linear term and nonlinear terms with increasing order of nonlinearity (quadratic,
cubic, etc.). The application of the method to nanostructured magnetic systems demonstrates that
the accurate description of magnetization dynamics requires a limited number of normal modes,
which results in a considerable improvement in computational speed. The proposed method can be
used to obtain a reduced-order dynamical description of magnetic nanostructures which allows
to adjust the accuracy between low-dimensional models, such as macrospin, and fully spatially
discretized micromagnetic models. This new paradigm for micromagnetic simulations is tested
for three problems relevant to the areas of spintronics and magnonics: directional spin-wave coupling
in magnonic waveguides, high power ferromagnetic resonance in a magnetic nanodot, and injection-locking
in spin-torque nano-oscillators. The case studies considered the validity of the proposed approach
as a new systematic method to obtain an intermediate order dynamical model based on normal modes
for the analysis of magnetic nanosystems. The time-consuming calculation of the normal modes has
to be done only one time for the system. These modes can be used to optimize and predict the system response
for all possible time-varying external magnetic fields. This is of utmost importance for various
applications where a fast and accurate system response is required, such as in electronic circuit
simulation software where an accurate response of the magnetic device has to be predicted.

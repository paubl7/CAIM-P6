Thin films of superconducting V$_3$Si were prepared by means of RF sputtering from a compound V$_3$Si
target at room temperature onto sapphire and oxide-coated silicon wafers, followed by rapid thermal
processing under secondary vacuum. The superconducting properties of the films thus produced
are found to improve with annealing temperature, which is ascribed to a reduction of defects in the
polycrystalline layer. Critical temperatures ($T_\text{c}$) up to $15.3\,$K were demonstrated
after thermal processing, compared to less than $1\,$K after deposition. The $T_\text{c}$ was
found to always be lower on the silicon wafers, by on average $1.9(3)\,$K for the annealed samples.
This difference, as well as a broadening of the superconducting transitions, is nearly independent
of the annealing conditions. In-situ XRD measurements reveal that the silicide layer becomes strained
upon heating due to a mismatch between the thermal expansion of the substrate and that of V$_3$Si.
Taking into account the volume reduction due to crystallization, this mismatch is initially larger
on sapphire, though stress relaxation allows the silicide layer to be in a relatively unstrained
state after cooling. On oxidized silicon however, no clear evidence of relaxation upon cooling
is observed, and the V$_3$Si ends up with an out-of-plane strain of 0.3\% at room temperature. This
strain increases as the sample is cooled down to cryogenic temperatures, though the deformation
of the polycrystalline layer is expected to be highly inhomogeneous. Taking into account also the
reported occurrence of a Martensitic transition just above the critical temperature, this extrapolated
strain distribution is found to closely match an existing model of the strain dependence of A-15
superconducting compounds.

Refractory producers face many challenges in terms of producing MgO-containing castables due
to the high likelihood of magnesia to hydrate in contact with water, resulting in Mg(OH)2 generation.
The expansive feature of this transformation affects the performance of such refractories, as
(i) if this hydrated phase is not accommodated in the formed microstructure, ceramic linings with
cracks and low green mechanical strength will be obtained; and (ii) if crack-free pieces are prepared,
they should present low porosity and reduced permeability, which require special attention when
heating these materials. This work investigated the ability of various additives in the optimization
of the drying behavior of Al2O3-MgO castables. Vibratable compositions were tested after incorporating
polymeric fibers (PF), an organic salt (OAS), SiO2-based additive (SM) or permeability enhancing
active compound (MP) into the dry-mixtures. Various experimental measurements were performed
to infer the role of the drying agents to prevent the samples explosion and whether they would also
influence other properties of the castables. As observed, OAS and MP helped to inhibit the MgO-bonded
samples explosion even under severe heating conditions (2-20C/min) and increased their green
mechanical strength and slag infiltration resistance when compared to the additive-free composition.
On the other hand, the addition of polymeric fibers (PF) or silica-based compound (SM) to the formulations
was not able to prevent the castables explosion when using a high heating rate and other side effects
could also be observed when testing these materials. Thus, the selection of suitable drying agents
is a key issue, as they may allow the development of MgO-bonded castables with enhanced properties
and lower spalling risk during their first thermal treatment.

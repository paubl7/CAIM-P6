We compute the electronic structure of acceptor clusters in silicon by using three methods to include
electron correlations: the full configuration interaction, the Heitler-London approximation,
and the unrestricted Hartree-Fock method. We show both the HL approach and the UHF method are good
approximations to the ground state of the full CI calculation for a pair of acceptors and for finite
linear chains. The total energies for finite linear chains show the formation of a 4-fold degenerate
ground state when there is a weak bond at the end of the chain, which is shown to be a manifold of topological
edge states. We identify a change in the angular momentum composition of the ground state at a critical
pattern of bond lengths and show it is related to a crossing in the Fock matrix eigenvalues. We also
test the symmetry of the UHF solution and compare it to the full CI; the symmetry is broken under almost
all the arrangements by the formation of a magnetic state in UHF, and we find further broken symmetries
for some particular arrangements related to crossings or potential crossings between the Fock-matrix
eigenvalues. We also compute the charge distributions across the acceptors obtained from the eigenvectors
of the Fock matrix: with weak bonds at the chain ends, two holes are localized at either end of the chain
while the others have a nearly uniform distribution over the middle; this implies the existence
of the non-trivial edge states. We apply the UHF method to treat an infinite linear chain with periodic
boundary conditions. We find the band structures in the UHF approximation and compute the Zak phases
for the occupied Fock-matrix eigenvalues; we find they do not correctly predict the topological
edge states in this interacting system. We find direct study of the quantum numbers characterising
the edge states provides a better insight into their topological nature.

Carefully designed micro and nanocarriers can provide significant advantages over conventional
macroscopic counterparts in biomedical applications. The set of requirements including a high
loading capacity, triggered release mechanisms, biocompatibility, and biodegradability should
be considered for the successful delivery realization. Porous calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is one
of the most promising platforms, which can encompass all the beforehand mentioned requirements.
Here, we study both the particles formation and biological applicability of CaCO3. In particular,
anisotropic differently shaped CaCO3 particles were synthesized using green sustainable approach
based on co-precipitation of calcium chloride and sodium carbonate/bicarbonate at different
ratios in the presence of organic additives. The impact of salts concentrations, reaction time,
as well as organic additives was systematically researched to achieve controllable and reliable
design of CaCO3 particles. It has been demonstrated that the crystallinity (vaterite or calcite
phase) of particles depends on the initial salts concentrations. The loading capacity of prepared
CaCO3 particles is determined by their surface properties such as specific surface area, pore size
and zeta-potential. Differently shaped CaCO3 particles (spheroids, ellipsoids, toroids) were
used to evaluate their uptake efficiency on the example of C6 glioma cells. The results show that
the ellipsoidal particles possess a higher probability for internalization by cancer cells. All
tested particles were also found to have a good biocompatibility. The capability to design physicochemical
properties of CaCO3 particles has a significant impact on drug delivery applications, since the
particles geometry substantially affects cell behavior (internalization, toxicity) and allows
outperforming standard spherical counterparts.

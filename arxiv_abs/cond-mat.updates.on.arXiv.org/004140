Recently, multifold fermions characterized by band crossings with multifold degeneracy and Fermi
surfaces with nontrivial Chern numbers have been discovered experimentally in AlPt[arXiv:1812.03310]
and XSi(X=Rh,Co)[arXiv:1812.04466][arXiv:1901.03358][arXiv:1809.01312]. In this work,
we largely expand the family of multifold fermion materials by pointing out that several well-studied
noncentrosymmetric superconductors are indeed multifold fermion metals. Importantly, their
normal state topological properties, which have been ignored in previous studies, play an important
role in the superconducting properties. Taking Li$_2$Pd$_3$B and Li$_2$Pt$_3$B as examples,
we found a large number of unconventional degenerate points, such as double spin-1, spin-3/2, Weyl
and double Weyl topological band crossing points near the Fermi energy, which result in finite Chern
numbers on Fermi surfaces. Long Fermi arc states in Li$_2$Pd$_3$B, originating from the nontrivial
band topology were found. Importantly, it has been shown experimentally that Li$_2$Pd$_3$B and
Li$_2$Pt$_3$B are fully gapped and gapless superconductors, respectively. By analyzing the possible
pairing symmetries, we suggest that Li$_2$Pd$_3$B can be a DIII class topological superconductor
with Majorana surface states, even though the spin-orbit coupling in Li$_2$Pd$_3$B is negligible.
Interestingly, Li$_2$Pt$_3$B, being gapless, is likely to be a nodal topological superconductor
with dispersionless surface Majorana modes. We further identified that several noncentrosymmetric
superconductors, such as Mo$_3$Al$_2$C, PdBiSe, Y$_2$C$_3$ and La$_2$C$_3$, are multifold fermion
superconductors whose normal state topological properties have been ignored in previous experimental
and theoretical studies.

A promising route to realize entangled magnetic states combines geometrical frustration with
quantum-tunneling effects. Spin-ice materials are canonical examples of frustration, and Ising
spins in a transverse magnetic field are the simplest many-body model of quantum tunneling. Here,
we show that the tripod kagome lattice material Ho${_3}$Mg${_2}$Sb${_3}$O${_{14}}$ unites an
ice-like magnetic degeneracy with quantum-tunneling terms generated by an intrinsic splitting
of the Ho$^{3+}$ ground-state doublet, which is further coupled to a nuclear spin bath. Using neutron
scattering and thermodynamic experiments, we observe a symmetry-breaking transition at $T^{\ast}\approx0.32$
K to a remarkable state with three peculiarities: a concurrent recovery of magnetic entropy associated
with the strongly coupled electronic and nuclear degrees of freedom; a fragmentation of the spin
into periodic and ice-like components; and persistent inelastic magnetic excitations down to
$T\approx0.12$ K. These observations deviate from expectations of classical spin fragmentation
on a kagome lattice, but can be understood within a model of dipolar kagome ice under a homogeneous
transverse magnetic field, which we survey with exact diagonalization on small clusters and mean-field
calculations. In Ho${_3}$Mg${_2}$Sb${_3}$O${_{14}}$, hyperfine interactions dramatically
alter the single-ion and collective properties, and suppress possible quantum correlations,
rendering the fragmentation with predominantly single-ion quantum fluctuations. Our results
highlight the crucial role played by hyperfine interactions in frustrated quantum magnets, and
motivate further investigations of the role of quantum fluctuations on partially-ordered magnetic
states.

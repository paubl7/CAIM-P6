The power of machine learning algorithms to automatically classify different phases of matter
and detect quantum phase transitions without necessity to characterize phases by various quantities
like local order parameters or topological invariants as in conventional approaches defined machine
learning phases of matter as a new research frontier and basic research tool in condensed matter
and statistical physics. We study quantum criticality in the spin-1/2 square-lattice J1-J2 model
with additional plaquette structure by combination of reinforcement and supervised machine learning
techniques. In our calculations the ground-state spin-spin correlation matrices for several
system sizes are first found by restricted Boltzmann machine based variational Monte Carlo method,
equivalent to reinforcement learning, and then used as a training data for convolutional neural
network based supervised machine learning algorithm for phases classification. The model exhibits
a quantum phase transition from paramagnetic plaquette resonating valence bond state to an antiferromagnetic
state and has been a topic of great interest because of its close connection to cuprate superconductors
and possibility of realization in cold atoms experiments. We consider both frustrated and unfrustrated
regimes and compare our results with the results obtained previously with other methods. We find
that our results are in good agreement with the results obtained by coupled cluster and real space
renormalization group methods for both frustrated and unfrustrated regimes. The quantum Monte
Carlo and finite-size scaling result for the unfrustrated case however slightly differs from our
result for the critical value of the inter-plaquette coupling strength, although the results are
still in reasonable agreement.

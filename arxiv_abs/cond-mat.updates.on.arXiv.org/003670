We derive the explicit Hamiltonian of twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) with Coulomb interaction
projected into the flat bands, and study the symmetries of the Hamiltonian. First, we show that all
projected TBG Hamiltonians can be written as Positive Semidefinite Hamiltonian, the first example
of which was found in [PRL 122, 246401]. We then prove that the interacting TBG Hamiltonian exhibits
an exact U(4) symmetry in the exactly flat band (nonchiral-flat) limit. We further define, besides
a first chiral limit where the AA stacking hopping is zero, a new second chiral limit where the AB/BA
stacking hopping is zero. In the first chiral-flat limit (or second chiral-flat limit) with exactly
flat bands, the TBG is enhanced to have an exact U(4)$\times$U(4) symmetry, whose generators are
different between the two chiral limits. While in the first chiral limit and in the non-chiral case
these symmetries have been found in [PRX 10, 031034] for the $8$ lowest bands, we here prove that they
are valid for projection into any $8 n_\text{max}$ particle-hole symmetric TBG bands, with $n_\text{max}>1$
being the practical case for small twist angles $<1^\circ$. Furthermore, in the first or second
chiral-nonflat limit without flat bands, an exact U(4) symmetry still remains. We also elucidate
the link between the U(4) symmetry presented here and the similar but different U(4) of [PRL 122,
246401]. Furthermore, we show that our projected Hamiltonian can be viewed as the normal-ordered
Coulomb interaction plus a Hartree-Fock term from passive bands, and exhibits a many-body particle-hole
symmetry which renders the physics symmetric around charge neutrality. We also provide an efficient
parameterization of the interacting Hamiltonian. The existence of two chiral limits, with an enlarged
symmetry suggests a possible duality of the model yet undiscovered.

Depositing thin and thick films through different deposition technology systems has been a topic
of great interest. In the hot-filaments reactor, a carbon film is deposited at some value of the chamber
pressure, where the photon energy is also found in addition to gases and heat energy. Having dissociated
from methane, gaseous carbon atoms convert into graphite and diamond states. Increase in chamber
pressure from 3.3 kPa to 14 kPa alters the morphology and structure of carbon films. Increasing the
chamber pressure upto 8.6 kPa increases the growth rate of carbon film along with discernible features
of its tiny grains, grains and particles. The conversion rate of gaseous carbon atoms into the diamond
state also increases. At high set chamber pressures, i.e., 11.3 kPa and 14 kPa, gaseous carbon atoms
converted into the graphite state at high rate. However, the films with low growth rates had deposited.
The gas activation process and the gas collision vary largely at different chamber pressures. Hence,
the morphology and structure of carbon films got deposited with different nucleation and growth
rates. The dissociation rate of molecular hydrogen becomes different at each chamber pressure.
Consequently, the amount of formation of typical energy varies. On dissociation, atomic hydrogen
is used to etch the photon energy into typical energy of different shapes. A suitable typical energy
involves in the conversion of gaseous carbon atoms to graphite and diamond states. Graphite atoms
get bound by the same involved energy. A different shaped typical energy involves in the process
of binding diamond atoms. Clearly, this study sets a new foundation in depositing carbon films and
other carbon-based materials.

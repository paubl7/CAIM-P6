Weakly spin-orbit coupled electron and hole spins in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) constitute
near-perfect two-level systems to explore the interaction of light and matter in the ultrastrong-drive
regime. Under such highly non-perturbative conditions, the frequency at which the spin oscillates
between states, the Rabi frequency, becomes comparable to its natural resonance frequency, the
Larmor frequency. For such conditions, we develop an intuitive understanding of the emergence
of hybrid light-matter states, illustrating how dipole-forbidden multiple-quantum transitions
at integer and fractional g-factors arise. A rigorous theoretical treatment of the phenomena comes
from a Floquet-style solution to the time-dependent Hamiltonian of the electron-hole spin pair
under resonant drive. To probe these phenomena experimentally requires both the development of
a magnetic-resonance setup capable of supporting oscillating driving fields comparable in magnitude
to the static field defining the Zeeman splitting; and an organic semiconductor which is characterized
by minimal inhomogeneous broadening so as to allow the non-linear light-matter interactions to
be resolved. The predicted exotic resonance features associated with the Floquet states are indeed
found experimentally in measurements of spin-dependent steady-state OLED current under resonant
drive, demonstrating that complex hybrid light-matter spin excitations can be formed and probed
at room temperature. The spin-Dicke state arising under strong drive is insensitive to power broadening
so that the Bloch-Siegert shift of the resonance becomes apparent, implying long coherence times
of the dressed spin state with potential applicability for quantum sensing.

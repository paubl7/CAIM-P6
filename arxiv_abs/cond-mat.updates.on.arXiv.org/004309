We present mesoscale numerical simulations of Rayleigh-B\'enard (RB) convection in a two-dimensional
model emulsion. The systems under study are constituted of finite-size droplets, whose concentration
Phi_0 is systematically varied from small (Newtonian emulsions) to large values (non-Newtonian
emulsions). We focus on the characterisation of the heat transfer properties close to the transition
from conductive to convective states, where it is known that a homogeneous Newtonian system exhibits
a steady flow and a time-independent heat flux. In marked contrast, emulsions exhibit a non-steady
dynamics with fluctuations in the heat flux. In this paper, we aim at the characterisation of such
non-steady dynamics via detailed studies on the time-averaged heat flux and its fluctuations.
To understand the time-averaged heat flux, we propose a side-by-side comparison between the emulsion
system and a single-phase (SP) system, whose viscosity is constructed from the shear rheology of
the emulsion. We show that such local closure works well only when a suitable degree of coarse-graining
(at the droplet scale) is introduced in the local viscosity. To delve deeper into the fluctuations
in the heat flux, we propose a side-by-side comparison between a Newtonian emulsion and a non-Newtonian
emulsion, at fixed time-averaged heat flux. This comparison elucidates that finite-size droplets
and the non-Newtonian rheology cooperate to trigger enhanced heat-flux fluctuations at the droplet
scales. These enhanced fluctuations are rooted in the emergence of space correlations among distant
droplets, which we highlight via direct measurements of the droplets displacement and the characterisation
of the associated correlation function. The observed findings offer insights on heat transfer
properties for confined systems possessing finite-size constituents.

We report the temperature dependent THz to mid-infrared response of hexagonal-ErMnO3 using absorption,
reflectivity, and emissivity techniques from 2 K to 1700 K. At low temperatures, lowest frequency
vibrational modes coexist with paramagnon excitations associated with well-defined crystal
field Rare Earth pure magnetic replicas in an intriguing phonon-magnetic convergence. Increasing
the temperature, a number of vibrational bands close to the space group predicted undergo profile
broadening and softening. In particular, a distinctive set of bands in the 288-329 cm-1 (300 K) range
has a component whose profile is carrier screened becoming nearly fully blurred in the intermediate
phase between ~830 K and ~1500 K. Below TC ~830 K this asymmetric band further splits as spin phonon
interaction and the tripling of the unit cell takes place revealing a delicate balance of long- and
short-range interactions. Ambient Raman scattering brings up evidence of a Fr\"ohlich resonance
due to Coulomb interactions between carriers and the macroscopic field of the longitudinal optical
phonon mode. We found it is dynamically correlated to the hexagonal c-axis negative thermal expansion.
Mid-infrared (MIR) optical conductivity show that also plays a role in small polarons and mediates
in high temperature bipolarones.At higher temperatures a low frequency Drude contribution is
triggered by electron hopping signaling an insulator-metal phase transition at ~1600 K while the
MIR response suggests coexistence between single small polarons and bipolarons. We draw a parallel
with improper ferroelectrics sustaining a lattice incommensurate intermediate phase and unit
cell tripling. We argue that in the h-RMnO3 (R=Rare Earth, Y) family of compounds the intermediate
phase be considered incommensurate with onset at TINC ~1500 K and ferroelectric lock-in at TC ~830
K delimiting this regime in h-ErMnO3.

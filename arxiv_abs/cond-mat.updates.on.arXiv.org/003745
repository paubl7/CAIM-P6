Topological spin liquids in two spatial dimensions are stable phases in the presence of a small magnetic
field, but may give way to field-induced phenomena at intermediate field strengths. Sandwiched
between the low-field spin liquid physics and the high-field spin-polarized phase, the exploration
of magnetic phenomena in this intermediate regime however often remains elusive to controlled
analytical approaches. Here we numerically study such intermediate-field magnetic phenomena
for two representative Kitaev models (on the square-octagon and decorated honeycomb lattice)
that exhibit either Abelian or non-Abelian topological order in the low-field limit. Using a combination
of exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group techniques, as well as linear
spin-wave theory, we establish the generic features of Kitaev spin liquids in an external magnetic
field. While ferromagnetic models typically exhibit a direct transition to the polarized state
at a relatively low field strength, antiferromagnetic couplings not only substantially stabilizes
the topological spin liquid phase, but generically lead to the emergence of a distinct field-induced
intermediate regime, separated by a crossover from the high-field polarized regime. Our results
suggest that, for most lattice geometries, this regime generically exhibits significant spin
canting, antiferromagnetic spin-spin correlations, and an extended proximate spin liquid regime
at finite temperatures. Notably, we identify a symmetry obstruction in the original honeycomb
Kitaev model that prevents, at least for certain field directions, the formation of such canted
magnetism without breaking symmetries -- consistent with the recent numerical observation of
an extended gapless spin liquid in this case.

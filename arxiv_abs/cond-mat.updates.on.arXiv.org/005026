We assess the ground-state phase diagram of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice
by employing Gutzwiller-projected fermionic wave functions. Within this framework, different
states can be represented, defined by distinct unprojected fermionic Hamiltonians that comprise
of hopping and pairing terms, as well as a coupling to local Zeeman fields to generate magnetic order.
For $J_2=0$, the so-called U(1) Dirac state, in which only hopping is present (such as to generate
a $\pi$-flux in the hexagons), has been shown to accurately describe the exact ground state [Y. Iqbal,
F. Becca, S. Sorella, and D. Poilblanc, Phys. Rev. B 87, 060405 (2013); Y.-C. He, M. P. Zaletel, M.
Oshikawa, and F. Pollmann, Phys. Rev. X 7, 031020 (2017)]. Here, we show that its accuracy improves
in presence of a small $antiferromagnetic$ super-exchange $J_2$, leading to a finite region where
the gapless spin liquid is stable; then, for $J_2/J_1=0.11(1)$, a first-order transition to a magnetic
phase with pitch vector ${\bf q}=(0,0)$ is detected, by allowing magnetic order within the fermionic
Hamiltonian. Instead, for small $ferromagnetic$ values of $|J_2|/J_1$, the situation is more
contradictory. While the U(1) Dirac state remains stable against several perturbations in the
fermionic part (i.e., dimerization patterns or chiral terms), its accuracy clearly deteriorates
on small systems, most notably on $36$ sites where exact diagonalization is possible. Then, upon
increasing the ratio $|J_2|/J_1$, a magnetically ordered state with $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$
periodicity eventually overcomes the U(1) Dirac spin liquid. Within the ferromagnetic regime,
the magnetic transition is definitively first order, at $J_2/J_1=-0.065(5)$.

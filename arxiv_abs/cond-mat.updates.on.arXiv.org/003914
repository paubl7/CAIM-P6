We critically reexamine the problem of interatomic exchange interactions, which describe the
total energy change caused by infinitesimal rotations of spins near some equilibrium state. For
the small variations, such interactions can be always related to the response function. However,
the form of this relation can depend on additional approximations. Particularly, the commonly
used magnetic force theorem (MFT) prescribes the linear relation between the exchange interactions
and the response function, while the exact theory requires this dependence to be inverse. We explore
the origin and consequences of these differences in the definition for the wide class of materials:
ferromagnetic Ni, antiferromagnetic NiO, half-metallic CrO2, multiferroic HoMnO3, and layered
magnets CrCl3 and CrI3. While in most of these cases, MFT produces quite reasonable results and can
be rigorously justifies in the long wavelength and strong-coupling limits, the exact formulation
appears to be more consistent, especially in dealing with two important issues, which typically
arise in the theory of exchange interactions: (i) the treatment of the ligand states, and (ii) the
choice of the suitable variable for the description of infinitesimal rotations of spins. Both issues
can be efficiently resolved by employing the ideas of adiabatic spin dynamics supplemented with
the exact expression for the exchange interactions. Particularly, we propose a simple "downfolding"
procedure for the elimination of the ligand spins by transferring their effect to the interaction
parameters between the localized spins. Furthermore, we argue that the rotations of spin moments
are more suitable for the description of low-energy excitations, while the rotations of the whole
magnetization matrix cause much stronger perturbation in the system of spins.

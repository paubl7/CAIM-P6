In recent years, new phases of matter that are beyond the Landau paradigm of symmetry breaking are
mountaining, and to catch up with this fast development, new notions of global symmetry are introduced.
Among them, the higher-form symmetry, whose symmetry charges are spatially extended, can be used
to describe topologically ordered phases as the spontaneous breaking of the symmetry, and consequently
unify the unconventional and conventional phases under the same conceptual framework. However,
such conceptual tools have not been put into quantitative test except for certain solvable models,
therefore limiting its usage in the more generic quantum manybody systems. In this work, we study
Z2 higher-form symmetry in a quantum Ising model, which is dual to the global (0-form) Ising symmetry.
We compute the expectation value of the Ising disorder operator, which is a non-local order parameter
for the higher-form symmetry, analytically in free scalar theories and through unbiased quantum
Monte Carlo simulations for the interacting fixed point in (2+1)d. From the scaling form of this
extended object, we confirm that the higher-form symmetry is indeed spontaneously broken inside
the paramagnetic, or quantum disordered phase (in the Landau sense), but remains symmetric in the
ferromagnetic/ordered phase. At the Ising critical point, we find that the higher-form symmetry
is also spontaneously broken, even though the 0-form symmetry is preserved. We discuss examples
where both the global 0-form symmetry and the dual higher-form symmetry are preserved, in systems
with a codimension-1 manifold of gapless points in momentum space. These results provide non-trivial
working examples of higher-form symmetry operators, including the first computation of one-form
order parameter in an interacting conformal field theory, and open the avenue for their generic
implementation in quantum many-body systems.

Establishing the composition-structure-property relationships for amorphous materials is
critical for many important natural and engineering processes, including the dissolution of highly
complex volcanic glasses. In this investigation, we performed force field molecular dynamics
(MD) simulations to generate detailed structural representations for ten natural CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2-TiO2-FeO-Fe2O3-Na2O-K2O
glasses with compositions ranging from rhyolitic to basaltic. Based on the resulting atomic structural
representations at 300 K, we have calculated the partial radial distribution functions, nearest
interatomic distances and coordination number, which are consistent with the literature data
on silicate-based glasses. Based on these structural attributes and classical bond valence models,
we have introduced a novel structural descriptor, i.e., average metal-oxygen (M-O) bond strength
parameter, which has captured the log dissolution rates of the ten glasses at both acidic and basic
conditions (based on literature data) with R2 values of ~0.80-0.92 based on linear regression.
This structural descriptor is seen to outperform several other structural descriptors also derived
from MD simulation results, including the average metal oxide dissociation energy, the average
self-diffusion coefficient of all the atoms at their melting points, and the energy barrier of self-diffusion.
Furthermore, we showed that the MD-derived descriptors generally exhibit better predictive performance
than the degree of depolymerization parameter commonly used to describe glass and mineral reactivity.
The results suggest that the structural descriptors derived from MD simulations, especially the
average M-O bond strength parameter, are promising structural descriptors for connecting composition
with dissolution rates of highly complex natural glasses.

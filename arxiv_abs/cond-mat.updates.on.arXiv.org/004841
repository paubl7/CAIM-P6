The climate system is a complex, chaotic system with many degrees of freedom and variability on a
vast range of temporal and spatial scales. Attaining a deeper level of understanding of its dynamical
processes is a scientific challenge of great urgency, especially given the ongoing climate change
and the evolving climate crisis. In statistical physics, complex, many-particle systems are studied
successfully using the mathematical framework of Large Deviation Theory (LDT). A great potential
exists for applying LDT to problems relevant for geophysical fluid dynamics and climate science.
In particular, LDT allows for understanding the fundamental properties of persistent deviations
of climatic fields from the long-term averages and for associating them to low-frequency, large
scale patterns of climatic variability. Additionally, LDT can be used in conjunction with so-called
rare events algorithms to explore rarely visited regions of the phase space and thus to study special
dynamical configurations of the climate. These applications are of key importance to improve our
understanding of high-impact weather and climate events. Furthermore, LDT provides powerful
tools for evaluating the probability of noise-induced transitions between competing metastable
states of the climate system or of its components. This in turn essential for improving our understanding
of the global stability properties of the climate system and of its predictability of the second
kind in the sense of Lorenz. The goal of this review is manifold. First, we want to provide an introduction
to the derivation of large deviation laws in the context of stochastic processes. We then relate
such results to the existing literature showing the current status of applications of LDT in climate
science and geophysical fluid dynamics. Finally, we propose some possible lines of future investigations.

Cubic f-electron compounds commonly exhibit highly anisotropic magnetic phase diagrams consisting
of multiple long-range ordered phases. Field-driven metamagnetic transitions between them may
depend not only on the magnitude, but also on the direction of the applied magnetic field. Examples
of such behavior are plentiful among rare-earth borides, such as RB$_6$ or RB$_{12}$ ($R$ = rare
earth). In this work, for example, we use torque magnetometry to measure anisotropic field-angular
phase diagrams of La-doped cerium hexaborides, Ce$_{1-x}$La$_x$B$_6$ ($x$ = 0, 0.18, 0.28, 0.5).
One expects that field-directional anisotropy of phase transitions must be impossible to understand
without knowing the magnetic structures of the corresponding competing phases and being able to
evaluate their precise thermodynamic energy balance. However, this task is usually beyond the
reach of available theoretical approaches, because the ordered phases can be noncollinear, possess
large magnetic unit cells, involve higher-order multipoles of 4f ions rather than simple dipoles,
or just lack sufficient microscopic characterization. Here we demonstrate that the anisotropy
under field rotation can be qualitatively understood on a much more basic level of theory, just by
considering the crystal-electric-field scheme of a pair of rare-earth ions in the lattice, coupled
by a single nearest-neighbor exchange interaction. Transitions between different crystal-field
ground states, calculated using this minimal model for the parent compound CeB6, possess field-directional
anisotropy that strikingly resembles the experimental phase diagrams. This implies that the anisotropy
of phase transitions is of local origin and is easier to describe than the ordered phases themselves.

The standard model of spin-transfer torque (STT) in antiferromagnetic spintronics considers
exchange of angular momentum between quantum spins of flowing conduction electrons and noncollinear-to-them
localized spins treated as classical vectors. These classical vectors are assumed to realize N\'{e}el
order in equilibrium, $\uparrow \downarrow \ldots \uparrow \downarrow$, such that their STT-driven
dynamics is then described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. However, many experimentally
employed materials (such as prototypical NiO) are strongly correlated antiferromagnetic Mott
insulators (AFMI) where localized spins form a ground state quite different from the unentangled
N\'{e}el state $|\!\! \uparrow \downarrow \ldots \uparrow \downarrow \rangle$. The true ground
state is entangled by quantum spin fluctuations, so that the expectation value of each localized
spin is zero and the classical LLG picture of rotating localized spins driven by STT is inapplicable.
Instead, a fully quantum treatment of both conduction electrons and localized spins is necessary
to capture exchange of spin angular momentum between them, denoted as {\em quantum STT}. We use a
very recently developed time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (tDMRG) approach
to quantum STT to demonstrate how injection of a spin-polarized current pulse into a normal metallic
layer proximity coupled to AFMI overlayer via exchange interaction and/or small interlayer hopping,
where such setup mimics topological-insulator/NiO bilayer employed in recent experiments, will
induce nonzero expectation values of localized spins within AFMI. They are collinear but spatially
inhomogeneous with zigzag profile, where the total spin angular momentum absorbed by AFMI increases
with Coulomb repulsion in AFMI, as well as when the two layers do not exchange any charge.

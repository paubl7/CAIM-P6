Recently there has been a renewed interest in the spectra and role in dynamical properties of excited
states of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnetic chain in longitudinal magnetic fields associated
with Bethe strings. The latter are bound states of elementary magnetic excitations described by
Bethe-ansatz complex non-real rapidities. Previous studies on this problem referred to finite-size
systems. Here we consider the thermodynamic limit and study it for the isotropic spin-1/2 Heisenberg
XXX chain in a longitudinal magnetic field. We confirm that also in that limit the most significant
spectral weight contribution from Bethe strings leads to gapped continua in the spectra of the spin
+- and xx dynamical structure factors. The contribution of Bethe strings to the zz dynamical structure
factor is found to be small at low spin densities and to become negligible upon increasing that density
above 0.317. For the -+ dynamical structure factor, that contribution is found to be negligible
at finite magnetic field. We derive analytical expressions for the line shapes of the +-, xx, and
zz dynamical structure factors valid in the vicinity of singularities located at and just above
the gapped lower thresholds of the Bethe-string states's spectra. As a side result and in order to
provide an overall physical picture that includes the relative location of all spectra with a significant
amount of spectral weight, we revisit the general problem of the line-shape of the transverse and
longitudinal spin dynamical structure factors at finite magnetic field and excitation energies
in the vicinity of other singularities. This includes those located at and just above the lower thresholds
of the spectra that stem from excited states described by only real Bethe-ansatz rapidities.

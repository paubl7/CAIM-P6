Implicit solvent, coarse-grained models with pairwise interactions can access the largest length
and time scales in molecular dynamics simulations, owing to the absence of interactions with a huge
number of solvent particles, the smaller number of interaction sites in the model molecules, and
the lack of fast sub-molecular degrees of freedom. In this paper, we describe a maximally coarse-grained
model for lipids in implicit water. The model is called SiMPLISTIC, which abbreviates for Single-site
Model with Pairwise interaction for Lipids in Implicit Solvent with Tuneable Intrinsic Curvature.
SiMPLISTIC lipids rapidly self-assemble into realistic non-lamellar and lamellar phases such
as inverted micelles and bilayers, the spontaneous curvature of the phase being determined by a
single free parameter of the model. Model membrane simulations with the lamellar lipids show satisfactory
fluid and gel phases with no interdigitation or tilt. The model lipids follow rigid body dynamics
suggested by empirical studies, and generate bilayer elastic properties consistent with experiments
and other simulations. SiMPLISTIC can also simulate mixtures of lipids that differ in their packing
parameter or length, the latter leading to the phenomenon of hydrophobic mismatch driven domain
formation. The model has a large scope due to its speed, conceptual and computational simplicity,
and versatility. Applications may range from large-scale simulations for academic and industrial
research on various lipid-based systems, such as lyotropic liquid crystals, biological and biomimetic
membranes, vectors for drug and gene delivery, to fast, lightweight, interactive simulations
for gaining insights into self-assembly, lipid polymorphism, biomembrane organization etc.

Implicit solvent, coarse-grained models with pairwise interactions can access the largest length
and time scales in molecular dynamics simulations, owing to the absence of computationally expensive
interactions with a huge number of solvent particles, the smaller number of interaction sites in
the model molecules, and the lack of fast sub-molecular degrees of freedom. Without an explicit
solvent, the solvent mediated effects are mimicked entirely through the interactions between
the model molecules. In this paper, we describe a maximally coarse-grained model for lipids in implicit
water. The model is called SiMPLISTIC, which is an acronym for Single-site Model with Pairwise interaction
for Lipids in Implicit Solvent with Tuneable Intrinsic Curvature. SiMPLISTIC lipids rapidly self-assemble
into realistic non-lamellar and lamellar phases such as inverted micelles and bilayers, the spontaneous
curvature of the phase being determined by a single free parameter of the model. Model membrane simulations
with lamellar SiMPLISTIC lipids show satisfactory fluid and gel phases with no interdigitation
or tilt. Despite being rigid molecules, SiMPLISTIC lipids can generate experimentally relevant
values for the bending stiffness of model membrane bilayers with no significant interleaflet coupling.
SiMPLISTIC can also simulate mixtures of lipids that differ in their packing parameter or length,
the latter leading to the phenomenon of hydrophobic mismatch driven phase separation or domain
formation. The model has a large scope due to its speed, conceptual and computational simplicity,
and versatility. Applications may range from academic and industrial research in various lipid-based
systems, such as lyotropic liquid crystals, biological and biomimetic membranes, vectors for
drug and gene delivery, emulsions for cosmetic products, to education, such as interactive molecular
dynamics simulations.

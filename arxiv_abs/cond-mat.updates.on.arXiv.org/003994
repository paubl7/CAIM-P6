We investigate the role of generic scale invariance in a Mott transition from a U(1) spin-liquid
insulator to a Landau Fermi-liquid metal, where there exist massless degrees of freedom in addition
to quantum critical fluctuations. Here, the Mott quantum criticality is described by critical
charge fluctuations, and additional gapless excitations are U(1) gauge-field fluctuations coupled
to a spinon Fermi surface in the spin-liquid state, which turn out to play a central role in the Mott
transition. An interesting feature of this problem is that the scaling dimension of effective leading
local interactions between critical charge fluctuations differs from that of the coupling constant
between U(1) gauge fields and matter-field fluctuations in the presence of a Fermi surface. As a
result, there appear dangerously irrelevant operators, which can cause conceptual difficulty
in the implementation of renormalization group (RG) transformations. Indeed, we find that the
curvature term along the angular direction of the spinon Fermi surface is dangerously irrelevant
at this spin-liquid Mott quantum criticality, responsible for divergence of the self-energy correction
term in U(1) gauge-field fluctuations. Performing the RG analysis in the one-loop level based on
the dimensional regularization method, we reveal that such extremely overdamped dynamics of U(1)
gauge-field fluctuations, which originates from the emergent one-dimensional dynamics of spinons,
does not cause any renormalization effects to the effective dynamics of both critical charge fluctuations
and spinon excitations. However, it turns out that the coupling between U(1) gauge-field fluctuations
and both matter-field excitations still persists at this Mott transition, which results in novel
mean-field dynamics to explain the nature of the spin-liquid Mott quantum criticality.

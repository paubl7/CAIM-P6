The validity of the Riemann Hypothesis (RH) on the location of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann
zeta-function is directly related to the growth of the Mertens function: the RH is indeed true if
the Mertens function goes asymptotically as $M(x) \simeq x^{1/2 + \epsilon}$. We show that this
behavior can be established on the basis of a new probabilistic approach based on the global properties
of the Mertens function. To this aim, we focus the attention on the square-free numbers and we derive
a series of probabilistic results concerning the prime number distribution along the series of
square-free numbers, the average number of prime divisors, the Erdos-Kac theorem for square-free
numbers, etc. These results lead us to the conclusion that the Mertens function is subject to a normal
distribution as much as any other random walk, therefore with an asymptotic behaviour given by $x^{1/2
+\epsilon}$. We also argue how the Riemann Hypothesis implies the Generalised Riemann Hypothesis
for the Dirichlet $L$-functions. Next we study the local properties of the Mertens function dictated
by the Mobius coefficients restricted to the square-free numbers. We perform a massive statistical
analysis on these coefficients, applying to them a series of randomness tests of increasing precision
and complexity. The successful outputs of all these tests (with a level of confidence of 99% that
all the sub-sequences analyzed are indeed random) can be seen as impressive experimental confirmations
of the probabilistic normal law distribution of the Mertens function analytically established
earlier. In view of the theoretical probabilistic argument and the large battery of statistical
tests, we can conclude that while a violation of the RH is strictly speaking not impossible, it is
however ridiculously improbable.

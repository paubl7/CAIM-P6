We consider the superconductor-semiconductor nanowire hybrid Majorana platform ("Majorana
nanowire") in the presence of a deterministic spatially slowly varying inhomogeneous chemical
potential and a random spatial quenched potential disorder, both of which are known to produce nontopological
almost-zero-energy modes mimicking the theoretically predicted topological Majorana zero modes.
We study the crossover among these mechanisms by calculating the tunnel conductance while varying
the relative strength between inhomogeneous potential and random disorder in a controlled manner.
We find that the entire crossover region manifests abundant trivial zero modes, many of which showing
the apparent "quantization" of the zero-bias conductance peak at $ 2e^2/h $, with occasional disorder-dominated
peaks exceeding $ 2e^2/h $. We present animations of the simulated crossover behavior and discuss
experimental implications. Additionally, in order to simulate the realistic disorder in experimental
nanowires, we also study in depth the case of disorder arising from random individual static impurities
along the wire, and consider crossover associated with such impurity effects. Our results, when
compared qualitatively with existing Majorana nanowire experimental results, indicate the dominant
role of random disorder in the experiments. It turns out that all three mechanisms may produce trivial
zero-bias peaks in the tunnel conductance, and the crossover among these physical mechanisms (i.e.,
when more than one mechanism is present in the system) is smooth and continuous, making it difficult
a priori to conclude which mechanism is dominant in a particular sample just by a casual inspection
of the zero-bias conductance peaks.

The cuprate superconductors are characterized by numerous ordering tendencies, with the nematic
order being the most distinct form of order. Here the intertwinement of the electronic nematicity
with superconductivity in cuprate superconductors is studied based on the kinetic-energy-driven
superconductivity. It is shown that the optimized Tc takes a dome-like shape with the weak and strong
strength regions on each side of the optimal strength of the electronic nematicity, where the optimized
Tc reaches its maximum. This dome-like shape nematic-order strength dependence of Tc indicates
that the electronic nematicity enhances superconductivity. Moreover, this nematic order induces
the anisotropy of the electron Fermi surface (EFS), where although the original EFS with the four-fold
rotation symmetry is broken up into that with a residual two-fold rotation symmetry, this EFS with
the two-fold rotation symmetry still is truncated to form the Fermi arcs with the most spectral weight
that locates at the tips of the Fermi arcs. Concomitantly, these tips of the Fermi arcs connected
by the wave vectors ${\bf q}_{i}$ construct an octet scattering model, however, the partial wave
vectors and their respective symmetry-corresponding partners occur with unequal amplitudes,
leading to these ordered states being broken both rotation and translation symmetries. As a natural
consequence, the electronic structure is inequivalent between the $k_{x}$ and $k_{y}$ directions.
These anisotropic features of the electronic structure are also confirmed via the result of the
autocorrelation of the single-particle excitation spectra, where the breaking of the rotation
symmetry is verified by the inequivalence on the average of the electronic structure at the two Bragg
scattering sites. Furthermore, the strong energy dependence of the order parameter of the electronic
nematicity is also discussed.

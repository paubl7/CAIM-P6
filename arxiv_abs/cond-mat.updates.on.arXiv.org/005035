The suite of highly confined polaritons supported by two-dimensional (2D) materials constitutes
a versatile platform for nano-optics, offering the means to channel light on deep-subwavelength
scales. Graphene, in particular, has attracted considerable interest due to its ability to support
long-lived plasmons that can be actively tuned via electrical gating. While the excellent optoelectronic
properties of graphene are widely exploited in plasmonics, its mechanical flexibility remains
relatively underexplored in the same context. Here, we present a semi-analytical formalism to
describe plasmons and other polaritons supported in waveguides formed by bending a 2D material
into a parabolic shape. Specifically, for graphene parabolas, our theory reveals that the already
large field confinement associated with graphene plasmons can be substantially increased by bending
an otherwise flat graphene sheet into a parabola shape, thereby forming a plasmonic waveguide without
introducing potentially lossy edge terminations via patterning. Further, we show that the high
field confinement associated with such channel polaritons in 2D parabolic waveguides can enhance
the spontaneous emission rate of a quantum emitter near the parabola vertex. Our findings apply
generally to 2D polaritons in atomically thin materials deposited onto grooves or wedges prepared
on a substrate or freely suspended in a quasi-parabolic (catenary) shape. We envision that both
the optoelectronic and mechanical flexibility of 2D materials can be harnessed in tandem to produce
2D channel polaritons with versatile properties that can be applied to a wide range of nano-optics
functionalities, including subwavelength polaritonic circuitry and bright single-photon sources.

An efficient description of the structures of liquids and, in particular, the structural changes
that happen with liquids on supercooling remains to be a challenge. The systems composed of soft
particles are especially interesting in this context because they often demonstrate non-trivial
local orders that do not allow to introduce the concept of the nearest-neighbor shell. For this reason,
the use of some methods, developed for the structure analysis of atomic liquids, is questionable
for the soft-particle systems. Here we report about our investigations of the structure of the simple
harmonic-repulsive liquid in 3D using the triple correlation function (TCF), i.e., the method
that does not rely on the nearest neighbor concept. The liquid is considered at reduced pressure
($P=1.8$) at which it exhibits remarkable stability against crystallization on cooling. It is
demonstrated that the TCF allows addressing the development of the orientational correlations
in the structures that do not allow drawing definite conclusions from the studies of the bond-orientational
order parameters. Our results demonstrate that the orientational correlations, if measured by
the heights of the peaks in the TCF, significantly increase on cooling. This rise in the orientational
ordering is not captured properly by the Kirkwood's superposition approximation. Detailed considerations
of the peaks' shapes in the TCF suggest the existence of a link between the orientational ordering
and the slowdown of the system's dynamics. Our findings support the view that the development of
the orientational correlations in liquids may play a significant role in the liquids' dynamics
and that the considerations of the pair distribution function may not be sufficient to understand
intuitively all the structural changes that happen with liquids on supercooling.

A number of recent Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations have demonstrated that screw dislocations
in face centered cubic (fcc) metals can achieve stable steady state motion above the lowest shear
wave speed ($v_\text{shear}$) which is parallel to their direction of motion (often referred to
as transonic motion). This is in direct contrast to classical continuum analyses which predict
a divergence in the elastic energy of the host material at $v_\text{shear}$. Within this work, we
first demonstrate through analytic analyses that the elastic energy of the host material diverges
at a dislocation velocity ($v_\text{crit}$) which is greater than $v_\text{shear}$, i.e. $v_\text{crit}
> v_\text{shear}$. We argue that it is this latter derived velocity ($v_\text{crit}$) which separates
'subsonic' and 'supersonic' regimes of dislocation motion in the analytic solution. In support
of our analyses, we show MD simulation results of stable steady state screw dislocation motion above
$v_\text{shear}$ and below $v_\text{crit}$ for several fcc materials at room temperature, which
are in agreement with several earlier studies. Both our independent MD simulations, and the earlier
works suggest that screw dislocation motion is always unstable above our derived $v_\text{crit}$
at room temperature. Despite these findings, in real-world polycrystalline materials $v_\text{crit}$
cannot be interpreted as a hard limit for subsonic dislocation motion. In fact, at very low temperatures
we find that screw dislocations in Cu can truly overcome $v_\text{crit}$: Our MD simulations of
Cu at 10 Kelvin confirm a recent claim in the literature that true 'supersonic' screw dislocations
with dislocation velocities $v>v_\text{crit}$ are possible at very low temperatures.

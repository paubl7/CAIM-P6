We introduce a novel momentum space entanglement renormalization group (MERG) scheme for the topologically
ordered (T.O.) ground state of the 2D Hubbard model on a square lattice (\cite{anirbanmotti,anirbanmott2})
using a unitary quantum circuit comprised of non-local unitary gates. At each MERG step, the unitary
quantum circuit disentangles a set of electronic states, thereby transforming the tensor network
representation of the many-particle state. By representing the non-local unitary gate as a product
of two-qubit disentangler gates, we provide an entanglement holographic mapping (EHM) representation
for MERG. Using entanglement based measures from quantum information theory and complex network
theory, we study the emergence of topological order in the bulk of the EHM. The MERG reveals distinct
holographic entanglement features for the normal metallic, topologically ordered insulating
quantum liquid and Ne\'{e}l antiferromagnetic symmetry-broken ground states of the 2D Hubbard
model at half-filling found in Ref.\cite{anirbanmotti}. An MERG analysis of the quantum critical
point of the hole-doped 2D Hubbard model found in Ref.\cite{anirbanmott2} reveals the evolution
of the many-particle entanglement of the quantum liquid ground state with hole-doping, as well
as how the collapse of Mottness is responsible for the emergence of d-wave superconductivity. We
perform an information theoretic analysis of the EHM network, demonstrating that the information
bottleneck principle is responsible for the distillation of entanglement features in the heirarchical
structure of the EHM network. As a result, we construct a deep neural network (DNN) architecture
based on our EHM network, and employ it for predicting the onset of topological order. We also demonstrate
that the DNN is capable of distinguishing between the topologically ordered and gapless normal
metallic phases.

The coloration mechanisms in electrochromic (EC) systems can be probed by comparing the dynamics
of the electrical and optical responses. In this paper, the linear frequency-dependent electrical
and optical responses of an amorphous tungsten oxide thin film were measured simultaneously by
a combination of two techniques$\text{---}$that is, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy
(EIS) and the so-called color impedance spectroscopy (CIS). This was done at different bias potentials,
which can be associated with different intercalation ratios. Equivalent circuit fitting to the
EIS spectra was used to extract the Faradaic components participating in the total impedance response.
The latter were assigned to an intermediate adsorption step before the intercalation and to the
diffusion of the electron-ion couple in the film. A quantity denoted complex optical capacitance
is compared to the complex electrical capacitance$\text{---}$in particular, their expressions
are related to the Faradaic processes. The coloration at low intercalation levels followed both
the adsorption and diffusion phenomena. Conversely, the diffusion contribution was dominant
at high intercalation levels and the adsorption one seemed to be negligible in this case. For perfectly
synchronized electrical and optical responses, their complex spectra are expected to differ only
by a multiplying factor. This was the case at low intercalation levels, apart from small deviations
at high frequencies. A clear departure from this behavior was observed as the intercalation level
increased. A combination of frequency-dependent techniques, as presented in this work, can help
in the understanding of the dynamics of the coloration mechanisms in EC materials at various conditions$\text{---}$for
example, at different intercalation levels and optical wavelengths.

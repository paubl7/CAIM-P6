A model for continuous-opinion dynamics is proposed and studied by taking advantage of its similarities
with a mono-dimensional granular gas. Agents interact as in the Deffuant model, with a parameter
$\alpha$ controlling the persuasibility of the individuals. The interaction coincides with the
collision rule of two grains moving on a line, provided opinions and velocities are identified,
with $\alpha$ being the so-called coefficient of normal restitution. Starting from the master
equation of the probability density of all opinions, general conditions are given for the system
to reach consensus. The case when the interaction frequency is proportional to the $\beta$-power
of the relative opinions is studied in more detail. It is shown that the mean-field approximation
to the master equation leads to the Boltzmann kinetic equation for the opinion distribution. In
this case, the system always approaches consensus, which can be seen as the approach to zero of the
opinion temperature, a measure of the width of the opinion distribution. Moreover, the long-time
behaviour of the system is characterized by a scaling solution to the Boltzmann equation in which
all time dependence occurs through the temperature. The case $\beta=0$ is related to the Deffuant
model and is analytically soluble. The scaling distribution is unimodal and independent of $\alpha$.
For $\beta>0$ the distribution of opinions is unimodal below a critical value of $|\alpha|$, being
multimodal with two maxima above it. This means that agents may approach consensus while being polarized.
Near the critical points and for $|\alpha|\ge 0.4$, the distribution of opinions is well approximated
by the sum of two Gaussian distributions. Monte Carlo simulations are in agreement with the theoretical
results.

Soft materials, such as liquids, polymers, foams, gels, colloids, granular materials, and most
soft biological materials, play an important role in our daily lives. From a mechanical viewpoint,
soft materials can easily achieve large deformations due to their low elastic moduli; meanwhile,
surface instabilities, including wrinkles, creases, folds, and ridges, among others, are often
observed. In particular, soft dielectrics when subjected to electrical stimuli can achieve significantly
large deformations that are often accompanied by instabilities. While instabilities are conventionally
thought to cause failures in the engineering context and carry a negative connotation, they can
also be harnessed for various applications such as surface patterning, giant actuation strain,
and energy harvesting. In the biological world, instability and bifurcation phenomena often precede
important events such as endocytosis, cell fusion, among others. Stability and bifurcation analysis
(especially for soft materials) is challenging and often presents a formidable barrier to entry
in this important field. A multidisciplinary audience may lack the background in one or more areas
that are needed to carry out the requisite modeling or even understand papers in the literature.
Furthermore, combining electrostatics together with large deformations brings its own challenges.
In this article, we provide a tutorial on the basics of stability and bifurcation analysis in the
context of soft electromechanical materials. The aim of the article is to use simple examples and
gently lead a reader, unfamiliar with either stability analysis or electrostatics of deformable
media, to develop the ability to understand the pertinent literature that already exists and position
them to embark on the state-of-the-art research on this topic.

A first-principles density functional method along with the direct solution of linearized Boltzmann
transport equations are employed to systematically analyze the low-temperature thermal transport
in crystalline GeTe. The extensive thermal transport simulations, ranging from room temperature
to cryogenic temperatures, reveal the emergence of a phonon hydrodynamic regime in GeTe at low temperature.
The reduction of grain boundary scattering is found to play a crucial role along with the divergent
trend of umklapp and normal scattering at low temperatures in accommodating the hydrodynamic regime.
Average scattering rates for normal, umklapp, and other resistive processes are distinguished
for a wide range (4-300 K) of temperatures and used for identifying various phonon transport regimes.
Therefore, the variations of lattice thermal conductivity, phonon propagation length, and thermal
diffusivity with temperature, related to these transport regimes (ballistic, hydrodynamic,
and kinetic), have been thoroughly investigated. The modewise decomposition of lattice thermal
conductivity and the distinction of thermal diffusivity according to different scattering processes
reveal rich information on the dominant phonon modes and phonon scattering processes in GeTe at
low temperature. Further, the kinetic-collective model is used to elucidate the hydrodynamic
behavior of phonon scattering through the relative study of collective and kinetic contributions
to the thermal transport properties. In this context, the Knudsen number is estimated through the
characteristic nonlocal length and the grain size, which further quantifies the consistent hydrodynamic
behavior of phonon thermal transport for GeTe. Finally, phonon-vacancy scattering for GeTe is
realized, and vacancies are found strongly to influence the hydrodynamic window while incorporating
the other resistive scattering mechanisms.

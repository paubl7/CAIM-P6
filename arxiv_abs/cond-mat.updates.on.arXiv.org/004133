The effect of a spatially uniform magnetic field on the shear rheology of a dilute emulsion of monodispersed
ferrofluid droplets, immersed in a non-magnetizable immiscible fluid, is investigated using
direct numerical simulations. The direction of the applied magnetic field is normal to the shear
flow direction. The droplets extra stress tensor arising from the presence of interfacial forces
of magnetic nature is modeled on the basis of the seminal work of G. K. Batchelor, J. Fluid Mech., 41.3
(1970) under the assumptions of a linearly magnetizable ferrofluid phase and negligible inertia.
The results show that even relatively small magnetic fields can have significant consequences
on the rheological properties of the emulsion due to the magnetic forces that contribute to deform
and orient the droplets towards the direction of the applied magnetic vector. In particular, it
has been observed an increment of the effective (bulk) viscosity and a reversal of the sign of the
two normal stress differences with respect to the case without magnetic field, in addition to the
significant enhancement of the normal stresses. Comparisons between the results of our model with
a direct integration of the viscous stress provided an indication of its reliability to predict
the effective viscosity of the suspension. Moreover, this latter quantity was found to be a monotonic
increasing function of the applied magnetic field for constant shearing flows ("magneto-thickening"
behaviour), which allowed us to derive a simple constitutive equation describing the emulsion
viscosity. Additionally, approximate equations describing the normal stress differences as
function of the magnetic Bond and capillary numbers have been derived through interpolation of
the data provided by our stress model.

We explore a class of "open" quantum circuit models with local decoherence ("noise") and local projective
measurements, each respecting a global Z_2 symmetry. The model supports a spin glass phase where
the Z_2 symmetry is spontaneously broken (not possible in an equilibrium 1d system), a paramagnetic
phase characterized by a divergent susceptibility, and an intermediate "trivial" phase. All three
phases are also stable to Z_2-symmetric local unitary gates, and the dynamical phase transitions
between the phases are in the percolation universality class. The open circuit dynamics can be purified
by explicitly introducing a bath with its own "scrambling" dynamics, as in [Bao, Choi, Altman, arXiv:2102.09164],
which does not change any of the universal physics. Within the spin glass phase the circuit dynamics
can be interpreted as a quantum repetition code, with each stabilizer of the code measured stochastically
at a finite rate, and the decoherences as effective bit-flip errors. Motivated by the geometry of
the spin glass phase, we devise a novel decoding algorithm for recovering an arbitrary initial qubit
state in the code space, assuming knowledge of the history of the measurement outcomes, and the ability
of performing local Pauli measurements and gates on the final state. For a circuit with L^d qubits
running for time T, the time needed to execute the decoder scales as O(L^d T) (with dimensionality
d). With this decoder in hand, we find that the information of the initial encoded qubit state can
be retained (and then recovered) for a time logarithmic in L for a 1d circuit, and for a time at least
linear in L in 2d below a finite error threshold. For both the repetition and toric codes, we compare
and contrast our decoding algorithm with earlier algorithms that map the error model to the random
bond Ising model.

Jamming criticality defines a universality class that includes systems as diverse as glasses,
colloids, foams, amorphous solids, constraint satisfaction problems, neural networks, etc.
A particularly interesting feature of this class is that small interparticle forces ($f$) and gaps
($h$) are distributed according to nontrivial power laws. A recently developed mean-field (MF)
theory predicts the characteristic exponents of these distributions in the limit of very high spatial
dimension, $d\rightarrow\infty$ and, remarkably, their values seemingly agree with numerical
estimates in physically relevant dimensions, $d=2$ and $3$. These exponents are further connected
through a pair of inequalities derived from stability conditions, and both theoretical predictions
and previous numerical investigations suggest that these inequalities are saturated. Systems
at the jamming point are thus only marginally stable. Despite the key physical role played by these
exponents, their systematic evaluation has yet to be attempted. Here, we carefully test their value
by analyzing the finite-size scaling of the distributions of $f$ and $h$ for various particle-based
models for jamming. Both dimension and the direction of approach to the jamming point are also considered.
We show that, in all models, finite-size effects are much more pronounced in the distribution of
$h$ than in that of $f$. We thus conclude that gaps are correlated over considerably longer scales
than forces. Additionally, remarkable agreement with MF predictions is obtained in all but one
model, namely near-crystalline packings. Our results thus help to better delineate the domain
of the jamming universality class. We furthermore uncover a secondary linear regime in the distribution
tails of both $f$ and $h$. This surprisingly robust feature is understood to follow from the (near)
isostaticity of our configurations.

A few decades earlier, Kirkaldy and Lane proposed an indirect method of estimating the tracer and
intrinsic diffusion coefficients in a ternary system (without showing experimental verification),
which is otherwise impossible following the Kirkendall marker experiments. Subsequently, Manning
proposed the relations between the tracer and intrinsic diffusion coefficients in the multicomponent
system by extending the Onsager formalism (although could not be estimated by intersecting the
diffusion couples). By solving these issues in this article, we have now proposed the equations
and method for estimating these parameters in pseudo-ternary diffusion couples in which diffusion
paths can be intersected in multicomponent space. We have chosen NiCoFeCr system for verification
of this method because of the availability of good quality diffusion couple experiments and estimated
tracer diffusion coefficients of all the components measured by the radiotracer method. An excellent
match is found when the tracer diffusion coefficients estimated following the newly proposed method
are compared with the data estimated following the radiotracer method. Following, the intrinsic
diffusion coefficients are estimated experimentally in a multicomponent system for the first
time highlighting diffusional interactions between the components. We have further shown that
the intrinsic diffusion coefficients are the same (if the vacancy wind effect is negligible/neglected)
when estimated from other types of diffusion couples (pseudo-binary and body diagonal) in the same
multi-component system. This method can be now extended to the Al, Ga, Si containing systems in which
the estimation of tracer diffusion coefficients following the radiotracer method is difficult/impossible
because of various reasons.

A strongly spin-orbital coupled systems could be in a magnetic ordered phase at zero field. However,
a Zeeman field could drive it into different quantum or topological phases. In this work, starting
from general symmetry principle, we construct various effective actions to study all these quantum
phases and phase transitions which take different forms depending on the condensation momenta
are commensurate or in-commensurate. We not only recover all these quantum phases and their excitations
achieved by the microscopic calculations, but also discover several novel classes of quantum phase
transitions with dynamic exponents $ z=1, z=2 $ and anisotropic ones $ (z_x=3/2, z_y=3) $ respectively.
We determine the relations between the quantum spin and the order parameters of the effective actions
which display rich spin-orbital structures. We find a new type of dangerously irrelevant operator
we name type-II, in distinction from the known one we name type-I. We explore a new phenomena called
order parameter fractionization where one complex order parameter split into two which is different
than quantum spin fractionization into a spinon and a $ Z_2 $ flux. Finite temperature transitions
are presented. The dynamic spin-spin correlation functions are evaluated. Thermal Hall conductivities
are discussed. The cases with the $ U(1)_{soc} $ symmetry explicitly broken are briefly outlined.
In view of recent experimental advances in generating 2d SOC for cold atoms in optical lattices,
these new many-body phenomena can be explored in the near future cold atom experiments. Implications
to various SOC materials such as MnSi, Fe$_{0.5}$Co$_{0.5}$Si, especially 4d Kitaev materials
$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in a Zeeman field are outlined.

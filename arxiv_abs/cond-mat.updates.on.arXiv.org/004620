Polarons with different types of electron-phonon coupling have fundamentally different properties.
When the dominant interaction is between the electron density and lattice displacement, the momentum
of the ground state does not change and the polaron gets exponentially heavy at strong coupling.
In contrast, one-dimensional Peierls/Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (PSSH) polarons with interaction
originating from displacement-modulated hopping feature a shift of the ground-state momentum
to finite values and moderate values of effective mass as coupling is increased REF[Phys. Rev. Lett.
105, 266605 (2010)]. Based on Diagrammatic Monte Carlo method, we investigate whether unusual
properties of PSSH polarons depend on the type of the displacement-modulated hopping and to what
degree they survive in higher dimension. We study two different PSSH models: with bosonic degrees
of freedom residing on sites (model A) and bonds (model B) of the two-dimensional square lattice.
For model A, we find that in both adiabatic and intermediate regimes, the momentum of the ground state
experiences a continuous transition from zero to a finite value as a function of coupling strength.
The transition is driven by quadratic instability of the dispersion function, implying that effective
mass diverges at the critical point, and then decreases in an anisotropic fashion with increasing
coupling. Unexpectedly, for model B, the momentum of the ground state always stays at zero and the
effective mass increases monotonously with coupling. The increase is far from exponential and
tends to level-off at strong interaction, resulting in relatively light polarons. Having light
polarons in the strong coupling regime is crucial for the bi-polaron mechanism of high-temperature
superconductivity REF[Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 247001 (2018)].

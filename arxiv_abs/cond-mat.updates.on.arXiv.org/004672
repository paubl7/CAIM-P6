The work is devoted to one method of structured sediments formation connected to evaporative lithography.
Experiments were carried out with nonuniform evaporation of an isopropanol film containing polystyrene
microspheres in a cylindrical cell. The local inhomogeneity of the vapor flux density was achieved
due to the temperature gradient. A copper rod was mounted in the central part of the bottom of the cell
for further heating. The thermocapillary flow resulting from the surface tension gradient due
to the temperature drop transfers the particles that were originally at rest along the bottom of
the cell. The effect of the initial thickness of the liquid layer on the height and area of the sediment
formed in the central region of the cell is studied. The velocity was measured using PIV. A model describing
the process at the initial stage is developed. The equations of heat transfer and thermal conductivity
were used to define the temperature distribution in the liquid and the cell. The fluid flow was simulated
by the lubrication approximation. The particle distribution was modeled using the convection-diffusion
equation. The evaporation flux density was calculated using Hertz-Knudsen Eq. The dependence
of the liquid viscosity on the particle concentration was described by Mooney's formula. Numerical
results showed that the liquid film gradually becomes thinner in the central region, as the surface
tension decreases with increasing temperature. The liquid flow is directed to the heater near the
substrate. It transfers the particles to the center of the cell. The volume fraction of the particles
increases over time in this region. The heat flow from the heater affects the geometry of the sediment
for two reasons. First, the Marangoni flow velocity depends on the temperature gradient. Secondly,
the decrease in film thickness near the heater depends on the temperature.

Disorder can have a dominating influence on correlated and quantum materials leading to novel behaviors
which have no clean limit counterparts. In magnetic systems, spin and exchange disorder can provide
access to quantum criticality, frustration, and spin dynamics, but broad tunability of these responses
and a deeper understanding of strong limit disorder is lacking. In this work, we demonstrate that
high entropy oxides present an unexplored route to designing quantum materials in which the presence
of strong local compositional disorder hosted on a positionally ordered lattice can be used to generate
highly tunable emergent magnetic behavior--from macroscopically ordered states to frustration-driven
dynamic spin interactions. Single crystal La(Cr0.2Mn0.2Fe0.2Co0.2Ni0.2)O3 films are used as
a structurally uniform model system hosting a magnetic sublattice with massive microstate disorder
in the form of site-to-site spin and exchange type inhomogeneity. A classical Heisenberg model
is found to be sufficient to describe how compositionally disordered systems can paradoxically
host long-range magnetic uniformity and demonstrates that balancing the populating elements
based on their discrete quantum parameters can be used to give continuous control over ordering
types and critical temperatures. Theory-guided experiments show that composite exchange values
derived from the complex mix of microstate interactions can be used to design the required compositional
parameters for a desired response. These predicted materials are synthesized and found to possess
an incipient quantum critical point when magnetic ordering types are designed to be in direct competition;
this leads to highly controllable exchange bias sensitivity in the monolithic single crystal films
previously accessible only in intentionally designed bilayer heterojunctions.

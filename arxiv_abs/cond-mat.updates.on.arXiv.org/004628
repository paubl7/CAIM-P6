The pseudogap (PG) regime of the underdoped cuprates arguably remains one of the most enigmatic
phenomena of correlated quantum matter. Recent theoretical ideas suggest that "fractionalized"
bosonic fields can lead to the PG phase, by opening a gap in the anti-nodal (AN) region of the Brillouin
zone. Such fractionalized boson can originate from modulated particle-particle pairs or pair
density wave (PDW), a magnetic stripe, or a modulated spin one particle-hole pair like a spin density
wave (SDW) boson, among others. The main picture goes as follows. Electrons under strong coupling
tend to form different types of unstable bosons at high temperatures. As the temperature goes down,
the compact object gets extremely unstable, and to minimize the entropy, it finally fractionalizes
into elementary components, linked by a constraint. The process of fractionalization involves,
in this way, an emergent gauge field directly linked to the constraint. This, in turn, couples to
the Fermi surface of electronic carriers and opens a gap in the AN region, which is partly responsible
for the PG phase. Alternative theoretical approaches invoke a simple coexistence between the multiple
quasi-degenerate orders like charge density wave (CDW), superconductivity (SC), and magnetic
orders at low temperatures. This scenario attributes the PG formation as a "vestigial" order showing
up at $T^{*}$, which acts as a precursor to the zero temperature orders. This intricate situation
calls for a key experimental test, enabling us to discriminate between the various theoretical
scenarios. In this paper, we focus on the case where the PDW boson has fractionalized into a CDW and
SC order below $T^{*}$, and we compare this to the situation where the two orders simply coexist.

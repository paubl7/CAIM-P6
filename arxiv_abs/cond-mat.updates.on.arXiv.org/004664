Significant progress on parameter-free calculations of carrier mobilities in real materials
has been made during the past decade; however, the role of various approximations remains unclear
and a unified methodology is lacking. Here, we present and analyse a comprehensive and efficient
approach to compute the intrinsic, phonon-limited drift and Hall carrier mobilities of semiconductors,
within the framework of the first-principles Boltzmann transport equation. The methodology exploits
a novel approach for estimating quadrupole tensors and including them in the electron-phonon interactions,
and capitalises on a rigorous and efficient procedure for numerical convergence. The accuracy
reached in this work allows to assess common approximations, including the role of exchange and
correlation functionals, spin-orbit coupling, pseudopotentials, Wannier interpolation, Brillouin-zone
sampling, dipole and quadrupole corrections, and the relaxation-time approximation. A detailed
analysis is showcased on ten prototypical semiconductors, namely diamond, silicon, GaAs, 3C-SiC,
AlP, GaP, c-BN, AlAs, AlSb, and SrO. By comparing this extensive dataset with available experimental
data, we explore the intrinsic nature of phonon-limited carrier transport and magnetotransport
phenomena in these compounds. We find that the most accurate calculations predict Hall mobilities
up to a factor of two larger than experimental data; this could point to promising experimental improvements
in the samples quality, or to the limitations of density-function theory in predicting the carrier
effective masses and overscreening the electron-phonon matrix elements. By setting tight standards
for reliability and reproducibility, the present work aims to facilitate validation and verification
of data and software towards predictive calculations of transport phenomena in semiconductors.

This paper is concerned with correlation functions of stochastic systems with memory, a prominent
example being a molecule or colloid moving through a complex (e.g., viscoelastic) fluid environment.
Analytical investigations of such systems based on non-Markovian stochastic equations are notoriously
difficult. A common approximation is that of a single-exponential memory, corresponding to the
introduction of one auxiliary variable coupled to the Markovian dynamics of the main variable.
As a generalization, we here investigate a class of "toy" models with altogether three degrees of
freedom, giving rise to more complex forms of memory. Specifically, we consider, mainly on an analytical
basis, the under- and overdamped motion of a colloidal particle coupled linearly to two auxiliary
variables, where the coupling between variables can be either reciprocal or non-reciprocal. Projecting
out the auxiliary variables, we obtain non-Markovian Langevin equations with friction kernels
and colored noise, whose structure is similar to that of a generalized Langevin equation. For the
present systems, however, the non-Markovian equations may violate the fluctuation-dissipation
relation as well as detailed balance, indicating that the systems are out of equilibrium. We then
study systematically the connection between the coupling topology of the underlying Markovian
system and various autocorrelation functions.We demonstrate that already two auxiliary variables
can generate surprisingly complex (e.g., non-monotonic or oscillatory) memory and correlation
functions. Finally, we show that a minimal overdamped model with two auxiliary variables and suitable
non-reciprocal coupling yields correlation functions resembling those describing hydrodynamic
backflow in an optical trap.

Soon after the discovery of superconductivity in Sr2RuO4 (SRO) in 1994, it was conjectured that
its order parameter (OP) has a form similar to that realized in the superfluid He-3, namely, odd parity
and spin triplet. The chiral p-wave pairing realized in He-3 A-phase was favored by several early
experiments, in particular, the muon spin rotation and the Knight shift measurements published
in 1998. However, the original Knight shift result was called into question in early 2019, raising
the question as to whether the chiral p-wave, or even the spin-triplet pairing itself, is indeed
realized in SRO. In this brief pedagogical review, we will address this question by counterposing
the currently accepted results of Knight shift, polarized neutron scattering (PNS), spin counterflow
half-quantum vortex (HQV), and Josephson experiments with predictions made both by standard BCS
theory and by more general arguments based only on (1) the symmetry of the Hamiltonian including
the spin-orbital terms, (2) thermodynamics, and (3) the qualitative experimental features of
SRO. We also introduce a notation for triplet states alternative to the more popular d-vector one
which we believe well suited to SRO. We conclude that the most recent Knight shift and PNS experiments
do not exclude in the bulk the odd-parity, spin-triplet "helical" states allowed by the symmetry
group of SRO but do exclude the chiral p-wave state. On the other hand, the Josephson and the HQV experiments
showed that the pairing in SRO cannot be of the even-parity, spin-singlet type, and in the surface
region or in samples of mesoscopic size, the d-vector must have a c-axis component, thus excluding
apparently all bulk p-wave states except the chiral p-wave. Possible resolution of this rather
glaring prima facie contradiction is discussed, taking into account other important experiments
on SRO touched upon only briefly in this article.

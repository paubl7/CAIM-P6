We present the phase diagram, the underlying stability and magnetic properties as well as the dynamics
of nonlinear solitary wave excitations arising in the distinct phases of a harmonically confined
spinor $F=1$ Bose-Einstein condensate. Particularly, it is found that nonlinear excitations
in the form of dark-dark-bright solitons exist in the antiferromagnetic and in the easy-axis phase
of a spinor gas, being generally unstable in the former while possessing stability intervals in
the latter phase. Dark-bright-bright solitons can be realized in the polar and the easy-plane phases
as unstable and stable configurations respectively; the latter phase can also feature stable dark-dark-dark
solitons. Importantly, the persistence of these types of states upon transitioning, by means of
tuning the quadratic Zeeman coefficient from one phase to the other is unravelled. Additionally,
the spin-mixing dynamics of stable and unstable matter waves is analyzed, revealing among others
the coherent evolution of magnetic dark-bright, nematic dark-bright-bright and dark-dark-dark
solitons. Moreover, for the unstable cases unmagnetized or magnetic droplet-like configurations
and spin-waves consisting of regular and magnetic solitons are seen to dynamically emerge remaining
thereafter robust while propagating for extremely large evolution times. Interestingly, exposing
spinorial solitons to finite temperatures, their anti-damping in trap oscillation is showcased.
It is found that the latter is suppressed for stronger bright soliton component "fillings". Our
investigations pave the wave for a systematic production and analysis involving spin transfer
processes of such waveforms which have been recently realized in ultracold experiments.

Intense current pulses are often required to operate microelectronic and spintronic devices.
Notably, strong current pulses have been shown to induce magnetoresistance changes attributed
to domain reorientation in antiferromagnet/heavy metal bilayers and non-centrosymmetric antiferromagnets.
In such cases, nonmagnetic resistivity changes may dominate over signatures of antiferromagnetic
switching. We report systematic measurements of the current-induced changes of the transverse
and longitudinal resistance of Pt and Pt/NiO layers deposited on insulating substrates, namely
Si/SiO$_2$, Si/Si$_3$N$_4$, and Al$_2$O$_3$. We identify the range of pulse amplitude and length
that can be used without affecting the resistance and show that it increases with the device size
and thermal diffusivity of the substrate. No significant difference is observed in the resistive
response of Pt and NiO/Pt devices, thus precluding evidence on the switching of antiferromagnetic
domains in NiO. The variation of the transverse resistance is associated to a thermally-activated
process in Pt that decays following a double exponential law with characteristic timescales of
a few minutes to hours. We use a Wheatstone bridge model to discriminate between positive and negative
resistance changes, highlighting competing annealing and electromigration effects. Depending
on the training of the devices, the transverse resistance can either increase or decrease between
current pulses. Further, we elucidate the origin of the nonmonotonic resistance baseline, which
we attribute to training effects combined with the asymmetric distribution of the current. These
results provide insight into the origin of current-induced resistance changes in metal layers
and a guide to minimize nonmagnetic artifacts in switching experiments of antiferromagnets.

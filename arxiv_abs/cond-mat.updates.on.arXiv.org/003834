In the scattering of a small onium off a large nucleus at high center-of-mass energies, when the parameters
are set in such a way that the cross section at fixed impact parameter is small, events are triggered
by rare partonic fluctuations of the onium, which are very deformed with respect to typical configurations.
Using the color dipole picture of high-energy interactions in quantum chromodynamics, in which
the quantum states of the onium are represented by sets of dipoles generated by a branching process,
we describe the typical scattering configurations as seen from different reference frames, from
the restframe of the nucleus to frames in which the rapidity is shared between the projectile onium
and the nucleus. We show that taking advantage of the freedom to select a frame in the latter class
makes possible to derive complete asymptotic expressions for some boost-invariant quantities,
beyond the total cross section, from a procedure which leverages the limited available knowledge
on the properties of the solutions to the Balitsky-Kovchegov equation that governs the rapidity-dependence
of total cross sections. We obtain in this way an analytic expression for the rapidity-distribution
of the first branching of the slowest parent dipole of the set of those which scatter. This distribution
provides an estimator of the correlations of the interacting dipoles, and is also known to be related
to the rapidity-gap distribution in diffractive dissociation, an observable measurable at a future
electron-ion collider. Furthermore, our result may be formulated as a more general conjecture,
that we expect to hold true for any one-dimensional branching random walk model, on the branching
time of the most recent common ancestor of all the particles that end up to the right of a given position.

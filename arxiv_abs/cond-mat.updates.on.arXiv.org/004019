FeSe is classed as a Hund's metal, with a multiplicity of $d$ bands near the Fermi level. Correlations
in Hund's metals mostly originate from the exchange parameter \emph{J}, which can drive a strong
orbital selectivity in the correlations. The Fe-chalcogens are the most strongly correlated of
the Fe-based superconductors, with $d_{xy}$ the most correlated orbital. Yet little is understood
whether and how such correlations directly affect the superconducting instability in Hund's systems.
By applying a recently developed high-fidelity \emph{ab initio} theory, we show explicitly the
connections between correlations in $d_{xy}$ and the superconducting critical temperature $T_{c}$.
Starting from the \emph{ab initio} results as a reference, we consider various kinds of excursions
in parameter space around the reference to determine what controls $T_{c}$. We show small excursions
in $J$ can cause colossal changes in $T_{c}$. Additionally we consider changes in hopping by varying
the Fe-Se bond length in bulk, in the free standing monolayer M-FeSe, and M-FeSe on a SrTiO$_{3}$
substrate (M-FeSe/STO). The twin conditions of proximity of the $d_{xy}$ state to the Fermi energy,
and the strength of $J$ emerge as the primary criteria for incoherent spectral response and enhanced
single- and two-particle scattering that in turn controls $T_{c}$. Using constrained RPA, we show
further that FeSe in monolayer form (M-FeSe) provides a natural mechanism to enhance $J$. We explain
why M-FeSe/STO has a high $T_{c}$, whereas M-FeSe in isolation should not. Our study opens a paradigm
for a unified understanding what controls $T_{c}$ in bulk, layers, and interfaces of Hund's metals
by hole pocket and electron screening cloud engineering.

By numerically exact calculations of spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg models on small clusters,
we demonstrate that quantum entanglement between subsystems $A$ and $B$ in a pure ground state of
a whole system $A+B$ can induce thermal equilibrium in subsystem $A$. Temperature ${\cal T}_{A}$
of subsystem $A$ is {\it not} a parameter but can be determined from the entanglement von Neumann
entropy $\mathcal{S}_{A}$ and the total energy $\mathcal{E}_{A}$ of subsystem $A$ calculated
for the ground state of the whole system. We show that temperature ${\cal T}_{A}$ can be derived by
minimizing the relative entropy for the reduced density matrix operator of subsystem $A$ and the
Gibbs state (i.e., thermodynamic density matrix operator) of subsystem $A$ with respect to the
coupling strength between subsystems $A$ and $B$. Temperature ${\cal T}_{A}$ is essentially identical
to the thermodynamic temperature, for which the entropy and the internal energy evaluated using
the canonical ensemble in statistical mechanics for the isolated subsystem $A$ are almost indistinguishable
numerically from the entanglement entropy $\mathcal{S}_{A}$ and the total energy $\mathcal{E}_{A}$
of subsystem $A$. Fidelity calculations ascertain that the reduced density matrix operator of
subsystem $A$ for the pure but entangled ground state of the whole system $A+B$ is almost identical
to thermodynamic density matrix operator of subsystem $A$ at temperature ${\cal T}_{A}$. We argue
that quantum fluctuation in an entangled pure state can mimic thermal fluctuation in a subsystem.
We also provide two simple but nontrivial analytical examples of free bosons and free fermions for
which these statements are exact. We furthermore discuss implications and possible applications
of our finding.

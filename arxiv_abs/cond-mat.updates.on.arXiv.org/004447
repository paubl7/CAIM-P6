In composite materials composed of soft polymer matrix and stiff, high-aspect-ratio particles,
the composite undergoes a transition in mechanical strength when the inclusion phase surpasses
a critical density. This phenomenon (rheological or mechanical percolation) is well-known to
occur in many composites at a critical density that exceeds the conductivity percolation threshold.
Conductivity percolation occurs as a consequence of contact percolation, which refers to the conducting
particles' formation of a connected component that spans the composite. Rheological percolation,
however, has evaded a complete theoretical explanation and predictive description. A natural
hypothesis is that rheological percolation arises due to rigidity percolation, whereby a rigid
component of inclusions spans the composite. We model composites as random isotropic dispersions
of soft-core rods, and study rigidity percolation in such systems. Building on previous results
for two-dimensional systems, we develop an approximate algorithm that identifies spanning rigid
components through iteratively identifying and compressing provably rigid motifs -- equivalently,
decomposing giant rigid components into rigid assemblies of successively smaller rigid components.
We apply this algorithm to random rod systems to estimate a rigidity percolation threshold and explore
its dependence on rod aspect ratio. We show that this transition point, like the contact percolation
transition point, scales inversely with the average (aspect ratio-dependent) rod excluded volume.
However, the scaling of the rigidity percolation threshold, unlike the contact percolation scaling,
is valid for relatively low aspect ratio. Moreover, the critical rod contact number is constant
for aspect ratio above some relatively low value; and lies below the prediction from Maxwell's isostatic
condition.

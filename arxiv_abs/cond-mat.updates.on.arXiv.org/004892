Developing quantum technologies requires the control and understanding of the non-equilibrium
dynamics of quantum information in many-body systems. Local information propagates in the system
by creating complex correlations known as information scrambling, as this process prevents extracting
the information from local measurements. In this work, we develop a model adapted from solid-state
NMR methods, to quantify the information scrambling. The scrambling is measured via time reversal
Loschmidt Echoes (LE) and Multiple Quantum Coherences experiments that intrinsically contain
imperfections. Considering these imperfections, we derive expressions for Out-of-Time-Order
Correlations (OTOC) to quantify the observable information scrambling based on measuring the
number of active spins where the information was spread. Based on the OTOC expressions, decoherence
effects arise naturally by the effects of the non-reverted terms in the LE experiment inducing localization
of the measurable degree of information scrambling. These effects define a localization cluster
size for the observable number of active spins that determines a dynamical equilibrium. We contrast
the model's predictions with quantum simulations performed with solid-state NMR experiments,
that measure the information scrambling with time-reversal echoes with controlled imperfections.
An excellent quantitative agreement is found with the dynamics of quantum information scrambling
and its localization effects determined from the experimental data. The presented model and derived
OTOCs set tools for quantifying the quantum information dynamics of large quantum systems (more
than $10^{4}$ spins) consistent with experimental implementations that intrinsically contain
imperfections.

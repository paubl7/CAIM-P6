The recently proposed dynamical effective field model (DEFM) is quantitatively accurate for describing
dynamical magnetic response of ferrofluids. In paper I it is derived under the framework of dynamical
density functional theory, via which the original ensemble of bare Brownian particles is mapped
to an ensemble of dressed particles. However, it remains to clarify how the characteristic rotational
relaxation time of a dressed particle, denoted by $\tau_r$, is quantitatively related to that of
a bare particle, denoted by $\tau^0_r$. By building macro-micro connections via two different
routes, I reveal that under some gentle assumptions $\tau_r$ can be identified with the long-time
rotational self-diffusion time. I further introduce two simple but useful integrated correlation
factors, describing the effects of quasi-static (adiabatic) and dynamic (nonadiabatic) inter-particle
correlations, respectively. In terms of both correlation factors I reformulate the dynamic magnetic
susceptibility in an illuminating and elegant form. Remarkably, it shows that the macro-micro
connection is established via two successive steps: a dynamical coarse-graining with nonadiabatic
effects accounted for by the dynamic factor, followed by equilibrium statistical mechanical averaging
captured by the static factor. Surprisingly, $\tau_r/\tau^0_r$ is found insensitive to changes
of particle volume fraction. I provide a physical picture to explain it. Furthermore, an empirical
formula is proposed to characterize the dependence of $\tau_r/\tau^0_r$ on dipole-dipole interaction
strength. The DEFM supplemented with this formula leads to parameter-free predictions in good
agreement with results from Brownian dynamics simulations. The theoretical developments presented
in this paper may have important consequences to studies of ferrofluid dynamics in particular and
other systems modelled by DDFTs in general.

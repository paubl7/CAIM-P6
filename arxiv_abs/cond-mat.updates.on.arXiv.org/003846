Topological phases of matter have established a new paradigm in physics, bringing quantum phenomena
to the macroscopic scale and hosting exotic emergent quasiparticles. In this thesis, I theoretically
and experimentally demonstrate with my collaborators the first Weyl semimetal, TaAs, using angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), directly observing its emergent Weyl fermions and topological
Fermi arc surface states [Science 349, 6248 (2015); Nat. Commun. 6, 7373 (2015); PRL 116, 066802
(2016)]. Next, I discover high-degeneracy topological chiral fermions in the chiral crystals
RhSi and CoSi, with wide topological energy window, maximal separation in momentum space and giant
Fermi arcs [Nature 567, 500 (2019); Nat. Mat. 17, 978 (2018)]. I establish a natural relationship
between the structural and topological chirality, associated with a robust topological state
which we predict supports a four-unit quantized photogalvanic effect [PRL 119, 206401 (2017)].
I also discuss the first quantum topological superlattice, in multilayer heterostructures consisting
of alternating topological and trivial insulators [Sci. Adv. 3, e1501692 (2017)]. The Dirac cones
at each interface tunnel across layers, forming an emergent atomic chain where the Dirac cones serve
as atomic orbitals. I achieve unprecedented control of hopping amplitudes within the superlattice,
realizing a topological phase transition. Lastly, I discover a room-temperature topological
magnet in Co$_2$MnGa [Science 365, 1278 (2019); PRL 119, 156401 (2017)]. I observe topological
Weyl lines and drumhead surface states by ARPES, demonstrating a topological invariant supported
by the material's intrinsic magnetic order. I also find that the large anomalous Hall effect in Co$_2$MnGa
arises from the Weyl lines. I hope that my discovery of Co$_2$MnGa establishes topological magnetism
as a new frontier in condensed matter physics.

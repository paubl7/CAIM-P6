We present a systematic study of the low-energy collective modes for different insulating states
at integer fillings in twisted bilayer graphene. In particular, we provide a simple counting rule
for the total number of soft modes, and analyze their energies and symmetry quantum numbers in detail.
To study the soft mode spectra, we employ time dependent Hartree-Fock whose results are reproduced
analytically via an effective sigma model description. We find two different types of low-energy
modes - (i) approximate Goldstone modes associated with breaking an enlarged U(4)$\times$U(4)
symmetry and, surprisingly, a set of (ii) nematic modes with non-zero angular momentum under three-fold
rotation. The modes of type (i) include true gapless Goldstone modes associated with exact symmetries
in addition to gapped "pseudo-Goldstone" modes associated with approximate symmetries. While
the modes of type (ii) are always gapped, we show that their gap decreases as the Berry curvature grows
more concentrated. For realistic parameter values, the gapped soft modes of both types have comparable
gaps of only a few meV, and lie completely inside the mean-field bandgap. The entire set of soft modes
emerge as Goldstone modes of a different idealized model in which Berry flux is limited to a solenoid,
which enjoys an enlarged U(8) symmetry. Furthermore, we discuss the number of Goldstone modes for
each symmetry-broken state, distinguishing the linearly vs quadratically dispersing modes.
Finally, we present a general symmetry analysis of the soft modes for all possible insulating Slater
determinant states at integer fillings that preserve translation symmetry, independent of the
energetic details. The resulting soft mode degeneracies and symmetry quantum numbers provide
a fingerprint of the different insulting states enabling their experimental identification from
a measurement of their soft modes.

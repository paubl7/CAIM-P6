Neutron diffraction and magnetic susceptibility studies show that orthorhombic single-crystals
of topological semimetals ${\rm Sr(Mn_{0.9}Cu_{0.1})Sb_2}$ and ${\rm Sr(Mn_{0.9}Zn_{0.1})Sb_2}$
undergo three dimensional C-type antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of the Mn$^{2+}$ moments at
$T_N = 200\pm10$ and $210\pm12$ K, respectively, significantly lower than that of the parent SrMnSb$_2$
with $T_N=297 \pm 3$ K. Magnetization versus applied magnetic field (perpendicular to MnSb planes)
below $T_N$ exhibits slightly modified de Haas van Alphen oscillations for the Zn-doped crystal
as compared to that of the parent compound. By contrast, the Cu-doped system does not show de Haas
van Alphen magnetic oscillations, suggesting that either Cu substitution for Mn changes the electronic
structure of the parent compound substantially, or that the Cu sites are strong scatterers of carriers
that significantly shorten their mean free path thus diminishing the oscillations. Density functional
theory (DFT) calculations including spin-orbit coupling predict the C-type AFM state for the parent,
Cu-, and Zn-doped systems and identify the $a$-axis (i.e., perpendicular to the Mn layer) as the
easy magnetization direction in the parent and 12.5% of Cu or Zn substitutions. In contrast, 25%
of Cu content changes the easy magnetization to the $b$-axis (i.e., within the Mn layer). We find
that the incorporation of Cu and Zn in SrMnSb$_2$ tunes electronic bands near the Fermi level resulting
in different band topology and semi-metallicity. The parent and Zn-doped systems have coexistence
of electron and hole pockets with opened Dirac cone around the Y-point whereas the Cu-doped system
has dominant hole pockets around the Fermi level with a distorted Dirac cone. The tunable electronic
structure may point out possibilities of rationalizing the experimentally observed de Haas van
Alphen magnetic oscillations.

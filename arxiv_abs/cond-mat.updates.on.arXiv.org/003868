This paper is an extended version of an article accepted for publication in Physical Review E. Besides
its fundamental interest, the model that we investigate in this article is simple enough to be used
as a basis for courses or tutorials on the thermodynamics of out of equilibrium systems. It allows
simple numerical calculations and analytical analysis which highlight important concepts with
an easily workable example. This version includes studies of fast cooling and heating, exhibiting
cases with negative heat capacity, and further discussions on the entropy which are not presented
in the Physical Review E version. Glasses are interesting materials because they allow us to explore
the puzzling properties of out-of-equilibrium systems. One of them is the Kovacs effect in which
a glass, brought to an out-of-equilibrium state in which all its thermodynamic variables are identical
to those of an equilibrium state, nevertheless evolves, showing a hump in some global variable before
the thermodynamic variables come back to their starting point. We show that a simple three-state
system is sufficient to study this phenomenon using numerical integrations and exact analytical
calculations. It also brings some light on the concept of fictive temperature, often used to extend
standard thermodynamics to the out-of-equilibrium properties of glasses. We confirm that the
concept of a unique fictive temperature is not valid, an show it can be extended to make a connection
with the various relaxation processes in the system. The model also brings further insights on the
thermodynamics of out-of-equilibrium systems. Moreover we show that the three-state model is
able to describe various effects observed in glasses such as the asymmetric relaxation to equilibrium
discussed by Kovacs, or the reverse crossover measured on $B_2O_3$.

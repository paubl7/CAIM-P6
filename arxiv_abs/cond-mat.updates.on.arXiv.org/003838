Recent developments in attosecond technology led to tabletop X-ray spectroscopy in the soft X-ray
range, thus uniting the element- and state-specificity of core-level x-ray absorption spectroscopy
with the time resolution to follow electronic dynamics in real time. We describe recent work in attosecond
technology and investigations into materials such as Si, SiO2, GaN, Al2O3, Ti, TiO2, enabled by
the convergence of these two capabilities. We showcase the state-of-the-art on isolated attosecond
soft x-ray pulses for x-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy (XANES) to observe the 3d-state dynamics
of the semi-metal TiS2 with attosecond resolution at the Ti L-edge (460 eV). We describe how the element-
and state-specificity at the transition metal L-edge of the quantum material allows to unambiguously
identify how and where the optical field influences charge carriers. This precision elucidates
that the Ti:3d conduction band states are efficiently photo-doped to a density of 1.9 x 10^21 cm^-3
and that the light-field induces coherent motion of intra-band carriers across 38% of the first
Brillouin zone. Lastly, we describe the prospects with such unambiguous real-time observation
of carrier dynamics in specific bonding or anti-bonding states and speculate that such capability
will bring unprecedented opportunities towards an engineered approach for designer materials
with pre-defined properties and efficiency. Examples are composites of semiconductors and insulators
like Si, Ge, SiO2, GaN, BN, quantum materials like graphene, TMDCs, or high-Tc superconductors
like NbN or LaBaCuO. Exiting are prospects to scrutinize canonical questions in multi-body physics
such as whether the electrons or lattice trigger phase transitions.

The structural degrees of freedom of a material are the various distortions most straightforwardly
activated by external stimuli. A highly successful design strategy in materials chemistry involves
controlling these individual distortions to produce useful functional responses. In a ferroelectric
such as lead titanate, for example, the key degree of freedom involves displacements of Pb$^{2+}$;
by coupling these together, the system interacts with electric fields. An exciting development
has been to exploit the interplay between different distortions: $e.g.$ generating polarisation
by combining different polyhedral rotations. Thus, degrees of freedom act as geometric `elements'
that can be combined to engineer materials with interesting properties. Just as the discovery of
new elements diversified chemical space, identifying new types of structural degrees of freedom
is a key strategy for developing new functional materials. In this context, molecular frameworks
are a fertile source of unanticipated distortion types, many of which have no parallel in conventional
solid-state chemistry. Framework materials are solids whose structures are assembled from nodes
and linkers to form scaffolding-like networks. These structures usually contain cavities, which
may host additional ions for charge balance. In the well-established systems---such as lead titanate---these
components are all atomic, but in molecular frameworks, at least one ion is molecular. Here, we survey
the unconventional degrees of freedom introduced through the replacement of atoms by molecules.
Our motivation is to understand the role these new distortions play in different materials properties.
The various degrees of freedom are summarised and described in the context of experimental examples.
We highlight a number of directions for future research, which demonstrate the extraordinary possibilities
for this nascent field.

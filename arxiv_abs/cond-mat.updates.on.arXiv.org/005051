$\beta-Ga_{2}O_{3}$ is an unusual semiconductor where large electric fields (~1-6 MV/cm) can
be applied while still maintaining a dominant excitonic absorption peak below its ultra-wide bandgap.
This provides a rare opportunity in the solid-state to examine exciton and carrier self-trapping
dynamics in the strong-field limit at steady-state. Under sub-bandgap photon excitation, we observe
a field-induced red-shift of the spectral photocurrent peak associated with exciton absorption
and threshold-like increase in peak amplitude at high-field associated with self-trapped hole
ionization. The field-dependent spectral response is quantitatively fit with an eXciton-modified
Franz-Keldysh (XFK) effect model, which includes the electric-field dependent exciton binding
energy due to the quadratic Stark effect. A saturation of the spectral red-shift with reverse bias
is observed exactly at the onset of dielectric breakdown providing a spectral means to detect and
quantify the local electric field and dielectric breakdown behavior. Additionally, the field-dependent
responsivity provides insight to the photocurrent production pathway revealing the photocurrent
contributions of self-trapped excitons (STXs) and self-trapped holes (STHs). Photocurrent and
p-type transport in $\beta-Ga_{2}O_{3}$ are quantitatively explained by field-dependent tunnel
ionization of excitons and self-trapped holes. We employ a quantum mechanical model of the field-dependent
tunnel ionization of STX and STH to model the non-linear field-dependence of the photocurrent amplitude.
Fitting to the data, we estimate an effective mass of valence band holes $(18.8 m_{0})$ and an ultrafast
self-trapping time of holes (0.045 fs). This indicates that minority-hole transport in $\beta-Ga_{2}O_{3}$
can only arise through tunnel ionization of STH under strong fields.

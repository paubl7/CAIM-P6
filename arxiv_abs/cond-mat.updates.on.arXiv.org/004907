We report the results of magnetic, heat-capacity, electrical and magnetoresistance measurements
on Ho4RhAl and Er4RhAl, characterized by 3 sites for rare-earths (R). Antiferromagnetic ordering
sets in at (T_N =) about 8.8 and 4.0 K respectively. While Ho compound appears to enter into a complex
spin-glass phase at T less thanT_N (at nearly 5 K), spin-glass component appears to set in essentially
almost at T_N for the Er case. The loss of the spin-disorder contribution in the magnetically ordered
state is not pronounced, mimicking that in Gd2PdSi3, a compound which now attracts interest in the
area of topological Hall effect and magnetic skyrmions, indicating complex Fermi surface. There
is a minimum in the temperature dependence of electrical resistivity in the case of only Ho above
T_N, but significant negative magnetoresistance is observed over a wide temperature range in the
paramagnetic state increasing with decreasing temperature for both the cases. This finding establishes
that these compounds belong to a select group of intermetallics in which spin-disorder contribution
apparently increases gradually as one approaches respective TN with decreasing temperature.
This could be an experimental signature for the effect due to classical spin-liquid above T_N. In
view of these properties analogous to those of Gd2PdSi3, it is of interest to investigate these 4:1:1
compounds further to understand possible unconventional roles of itinerant electrons, not only
in the magnetically ordered state but also in the paramagnetic state, predicted by some theories
in recent years for which this Gd compound is considered to be a classic example.Besides, magnetoresistance
and isothermal entropy change (magnetocaloric effect) track each other.

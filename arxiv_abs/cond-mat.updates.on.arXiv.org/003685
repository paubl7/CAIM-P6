Migdal-Eliashberg theory describes the properties of the normal and superconducting states of
electron-phonon mediated superconductors based on a perturbative treatment of the electron-phonon
interactions. It is necessary to include both electron and phonon self-energies self-consistently
in Migdal-Eliashberg theory in order to match numerically exact results from determinantal quantum
Monte Carlo in the adiabatic limit. In this work we provide a method to obtain the real-axis solutions
of the Migdal-Eliashberg equations with electron and phonon self-energies calculated self-consistently.
Our method avoids the typical challenge of computing cumbersome singular integrals on the real
axis and is numerically stable and exhibits fast convergence. Analyzing the resulting real-frequency
spectra and self-energies of the two-dimensional Holstein model, we find that self-consistently
including the lowest-order correction to the phonon self-energy significantly affects the solution
of the Migdal-Eliashberg equations. The calculation captures the broadness of the spectral function,
renormalization of the phonon dispersion, enhanced effective electron-phonon coupling strength,
minimal increase in the electron effective mass, and the enhancement of superconductivity which
manifests as a superconducting ground state despite strong competition with charge-density-wave
order. We discuss surprising differences in two common definitions of the electron-phonon coupling
strength derived from the electron mass and the density of states, quantities which are accessible
through experiments such as angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and electron tunneling.
An approximate upper bound on $2\Delta / T_c$ for conventional superconductors mediated by retarded
electron-phonon interactions is proposed.

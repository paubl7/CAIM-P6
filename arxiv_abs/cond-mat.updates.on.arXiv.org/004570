Elastomers are used in a wide range of applications because of their large strain to failure, low
density, and tailorable stiffness and toughness. The mechanical behavior of elastomers derives
mainly from the entropic elasticity of the underlying network of polymer chains. Elastomers under
large deformation experience bonds breaking within the polymer network. This breaking of chains
damages the network, can lead to material failure, and can be utilized as an energy dissipation mechanism.
In the case of reversible bonds, broken chains may reform and heal the damage in the network. If the
reversible bonds are dynamic, chains constantly break and reform and create a transient network.
A fundamental constitutive theory is developed to model the mechanics of these polymer networks.
A statistical mechanical derivation is conducted to yield a framework that takes in an arbitrary
single-chain model (a Hamiltonian) and outputs: the single-chain mechanical response, the breaking
and reforming kinetics, the equilibrium distribution of chains in the network, and the partial
differential equations governing the deformation-coupled network evolution. This statistical
mechanical framework is then brought into the continuum scale by using macroscopic thermodynamic
constitutive theory to obtain a constitutive relation for the Cauchy stress. The potential-supplemented
freely jointed chain ($u$FJC) model is introduced, and a parametric study of its mechanical response
and breaking kinetics is provided. This single-chain model is then implemented within the constitutive
framework, which we specialize and apply in two exemplary cases: the mechanical response and irreversible
breakdown of a multinetwork elastomer, and the mechanical response of a dual crosslink gel. After
providing a parametric study of the general constitutive model, we apply it to a hydrogel with reversible
metal-coordination crosslinks.

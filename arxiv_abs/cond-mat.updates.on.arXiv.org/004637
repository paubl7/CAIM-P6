The bulk-boundary correspondence, which links a bulk topological property of a material to the
existence of robust boundary states, is a hallmark of topological insulators. However, in crystalline
topological materials the presence of boundary states in the insulating gap is not always necessary
since they can be hidden in the bulk energy bands, obscured by boundary artifacts of non-topological
origin, or, in the case of higher-order topology, they can be gapped altogether. Crucially, in such
systems the interplay between symmetry-protected topology and the corresponding symmetry defects
can provide a variety of bulk probes to reveal their topological nature. For example, bulk crystallographic
defects, such as disclinations and dislocations, have been shown to bind fractional charges and/or
robust localized bound states in insulators protected by crystalline symmetries. Recently, exotic
defects of translation symmetry called partial dislocations have been proposed as a probe of higher-order
topology. However, it is a herculean task to have experimental control over the generation and probing
of isolated defects in solid-state systems; hence their use as a bulk probe of topology faces many
challenges. Instead, here we show that partial dislocation probes of higher-order topology are
ideally suited to the context of engineered materials. Indeed, we present the first observations
of partial-dislocation-induced topological modes in 2D and 3D higher-order topological insulators
built from circuit-based resonator arrays. While rotational defects (disclinations) have previously
been shown to indicate higher-order topology, our work provides the first experimental evidence
that exotic translation defects (partial dislocations) are bulk topological probes.

Gene regulatory networks (GRN) have developed their functions through evolution, thus reflecting
the evolutionary histories they followed. Some of their properties could be consequences of the
particularity in the evolutionary mechanism, and some may be more universal, determined largely
by external conditions. To understand the universality and particularity of the evolutionary
process theoretically, evolutionary simulations (ES) alone are insufficient, because the outcomes
of ES depend on evolutionary pathways. Thus, a reference system is required. The appropriate reference
system for this purpose is a set of randomly sampled GRNs. In this study, we constructed a reference
set using the method proposed by Nagata and Kikuchi (PLoS Comput Biol 16 (2020) e1007969) and compared
it with the results of ES. While this approach can be applid to evolution in general, we focused on
the emergence of bistability and enhancement of mutational robustness by evolution. We found the
following results: First, random sampling revealed that GRNs with high fitness exhibited bistability
when we required a sensitive response to environmental change. The increase in the fractions of
bistable GRNs in ES occurred at higher fitness levels than those in the reference set. Therefore,
the emergence of a new phenotype, bistability, was delayed in evolution. Second, mutational robustness
was significantly higher in ES than in the reference set. Therefore, the mutational robustness
was enhanced by evolution. Bistable GRNs contain many mutationally fragile GRNs compared to non-bistable
GRNs. This implies that the delayed emergence of bistability is a consequence of the mutation-selection
mechanism of evolution. Third, evolution begins to slow down significantly at the fitness level
where the number of available GRNs begins to decrease rapidly. This implies that evolutionary speed
is determined mainly by "entropy."

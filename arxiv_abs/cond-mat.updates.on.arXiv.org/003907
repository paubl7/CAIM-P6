With decreasing system sizes, the mechanical properties and dominant deformation mechanisms
of metals change. For larger scales, bulk behavior is observed that is characterized by a preservation
and significant increase of dislocation content during deformation whereas at the submicron scale
very localized dislocation activity as well as dislocation starvation is observed. In the transition
regime it is not clear how the dislocation content is built up. This dislocation storage regime and
its underlying physical mechanisms are still an open field of research. In this paper, the microstructure
evolution of single crystalline copper micropillars with a $\langle1\,1\,0\rangle$ crystal
orientation and varying sizes between $1$ to $10\,\mu\mathrm{m}$ is analysed under compression
loading. Experimental in situ HR-EBSD measurements as well as 3d continuum dislocation dynamics
simulations are presented. The experimental results provide insights into the material deformation
and evolution of dislocation structures during continuous loading. This is complemented by the
simulation of the dislocation density evolution considering dislocation dynamics, interactions,
and reactions of the individual slip systems providing direct access to these quantities. Results
are presented that show, how the plastic deformation of the material takes place and how the different
slip systems are involved. A central finding is, that an increasing amount of GND density is stored
in the system during loading that is located dominantly on the slip systems that are not mainly responsible
for the production of plastic slip. This might be a characteristic feature of the considered size
regime that has direct impact on further dislocation network formation and the corresponding contribution
to plastic hardening.

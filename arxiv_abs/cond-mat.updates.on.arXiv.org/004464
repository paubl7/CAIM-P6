The study of the structural behaviour of pure and multi-component lipids at various temperatures
and the interaction of these multi-component lipids with pharmaceutically important drugs carry
huge importance. Here, we investigated the phase behaviour of the pure PSPC (1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine),
and multicomponent PSPC and DSPE-PEG2000(1,2-distearoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N[amino(polyethylene
glycol)-2000]) membranes at seven different temperatures ranging from 280 K to 360 K, and calculated
their structural properties. We observe a transition from the gel phase to the liquid crystalline
phase between 320 K and 330 K in agreement with experimental reports for pure PSPC. PSPC remained
in the tilted gel phase L\b{eta}$'$ at 320 K and 310 K, entered the 'mixed ordered' domain with a partially
interdigitated region at 300 K, and finally formed the sub gel phase at 280 K. We studied the self-assembly
for the multicomponent PSPC and DSPE-PEG2000 membranes and found the coexistence of ordered and
disordered phases at 320 K. In comparison to the pure PSPC, for multicomponent system, this transition
was gradual, and a complete liquid crystalline to gel phase transformation occurred between 320
K and 310 K. We further studied the interaction of Paclitaxel with pure PSPC and PEGylated multicomponent
lipid bilayers using umbrella sampling technique and observed PEG promotes the interaction of
Paclitaxel with the later one in comparison to the former. Above the bilayer transition temperature,
Paclitaxel interacts more with the bilayer and enters inside the bilayer easily for both systems.
Understanding of structural and interaction behaviour of the PEGylated multicomponent lipid
bilayers with Paclitaxel will help explore Paclitaxel based drug applications in the future.

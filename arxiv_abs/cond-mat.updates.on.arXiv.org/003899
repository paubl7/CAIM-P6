We have used Rietveld refinement technique to determine the extent of intergrowth of Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CuO$_{6+x}$
phase and co-crystallization of competing phases in a high temperature superconductor Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+x}$
(Bi-2212). The refinement was done on powder diffractograms obtained on powders of Bi-2212 made
by grinding single crystals of Bi-2212 grown using two different self-flux techniques, namely
pressure technique (PT) and regrowth technique(RG). JANA and FullPROF programs were used for refinement,
both of which gave consistent results. Bi and Sr atom's positions were refined in the average structure
of centrosymmetric space group $Bbmb$. To incorporate for Bi atoms modulation and modulation vector,
refinement was done in centrosymmetric space group N$^{Bbmb}_{1\bar{1}1}$(Bbmb(0$\gamma$1)).
It was found that the b* component of the modulation vector decreased with a decrease in the superconducting
transition temperature in PT sample compared to the RG sample, suggesting a better alignment of
the CuO$_2$ planes with respect to Bi-O planes in PT sample. All the samples were also found to exhibit
strong preferred orientation effect. Values of March-Dollase parameters corresponding to the
preferred orientation function were obtained. We also calculated Brindley absorption contrast
factors \textit{t}$_{\phi}$ and the effect of micro-absorption on the quantity of phases present
in each sample. A Rietveld refinement incorporating all the factors resulted in exceptional values
of goodness of fit parameters for all the samples with the lowest value of 2.08 found for the PT sample
ground for 2 minutes. Additionally, the powders corresponding to the PT crystals were found to have
no co-crystallising phase and $\sim$ 94$\%$ Bi-2212 phase, suggesting that crystals grown by pressure
technique are of extremely good quality, much better than those grown by RG flux technique.

The competition between the indirect exchange interaction (IEC) of magnetic impurities in metals
and the Kondo effect gives rise to a rich quantum phase diagram, the Doniach Diagram. In disordered
metals, both the Kondo temperature and the IEC are widely distributed due to the scattering of the
conduction electrons from the impurity potential. Therefore, it is a question of fundamental importance,
how this Doniach diagram is modified by the disorder, and if one can still identify separate phases.
Recently, it has been investigated the effect of Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) correlations
on the Kondo effect of two magnetic impurities, renormalizing the Kondo interaction based on the
Bethe-Salpeter equation and performing the poor men's renormalization group (RG) analysis with
the RKKY-renormalized Kondo coupling. In the present study, we extend this theoretical framework,
allowing for different Kondo temperatures of two RKKY-coupled magnetic impurities due to different
local exchange couplings and density of states. As a result, we find that the smaller one of the two
Kondo temperatures is suppressed more strongly by the RKKY interaction, thereby enhancing their
initial inequality. Moreover, it turns out that the stronger the inhomogeneity and the smaller
the ratio of the bare Kondo temperatures is. In order to find out if this relevance of inequalities
between Kondo temperatures modifies the distribution of the Kondo temperature in a system of a finite
density of randomly distributed magnetic impurities, we present an extension of the RKKY coupled
Kondo RG equations. We discuss the implication of these results for the interplay between Kondo
coupling and RKKY interaction in disordered electron systems and the Doniach diagram in disordered
electron systems.

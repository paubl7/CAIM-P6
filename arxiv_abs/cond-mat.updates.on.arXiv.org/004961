Soft electroactive materials can undergo large deformation subjected to either mechanical or
electrical stimulus, and hence they can be excellent candidates for designing extremely flexible
and adaptive structures and devices. This paper proposes a simple one-dimensional soft phononic
crystal cylinder made of dielectric elastomer to show how large deformation and electric field
can be used jointly to tune the longitudinal waves propagating in the PC. A series of soft electrodes
are placed periodically along the dielectric elastomer cylinder, and hence the material can be
regarded as uniform in the undeformed state. This is also the case for the uniformly pre-stretched
state induced by a static axial force only. The effective periodicity of the structure is then achieved
through two loading paths, i.e. by maintaining the longitudinal stretch and applying an electric
voltage over any two neighbouring electrodes, or by holding the axial force and applying the voltage.
All physical field variables for both configurations can be determined exactly based on the nonlinear
theory of electroelasticity. An infinitesimal wave motion is further superimposed on the pre-deformed
configurations and the corresponding dispersion equations are derived analytically by invoking
the linearized theory for incremental motions. Numerical examples are finally considered to show
the tunability of wave propagation behavior in the soft PC cylinder. The outstanding performance
regarding the band gap (BG) property of the proposed soft dielectric PC is clearly demonstrated
by comparing with the conventional design adopting the hard piezoelectric material. Note that
soft dielectric PCs are susceptible to various kinds of failure (buckling, electromechanical
instability, electric breakdown, etc.), imposing corresponding limits on the external stimuli.

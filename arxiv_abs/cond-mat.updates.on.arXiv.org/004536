Atomically thin monolayers of graphene show excellent electronic properties which have led to
a great deal of research on their use in nanoscale devices. However, heat management of such nanoscale
devices is essential in order to improve their performance. Graphene supported on hexagonal boron
nitride (h-BN) substrate has been reported to show enhanced (opto)electronic and thermal properties
as compared to extensively used SiO2/Si supported graphene. Motivated by this, we have performed
temperature- and power-dependent Raman Spectroscopic measurements on four different types of
(hetero)structures: (a) h-BN (BN), (b) graphene (Gr), (c) h-BN on graphene (BG), and (d) graphene
encapsulated by h-BN layers from both top and bottom (BGB), all supported on SiO2/Si substrate.
We have estimated the values of thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) and interfacial thermal conductance
per unit area (g) of these four (hetero)structures to demonstrate the structure-activity (thermal)
relationship. We report here the values of \k{appa} and g for h-BN supported on SiO2/Si as 280.0 +-58.0
Wm-1K-1 and 25.6+-0.4 MWm-2K-1, respectively. More importantly, we have observed an improvement
in both thermal conductivity and interfacial thermal conductance per unit area in the heterostructures
which ensures a better heat dissipation in devices. The \k{appa} and g of h-BN encapsulated graphene
on SiO2/Si (BGB) sample was observed to be 850.0+-81.0 Wm-1K-1 and 105+-1 MWm-2K-1, respectively,
as opposed to 600.0+-93.0 Wm-1K-1 and 1.15+-0.40 MWm-2K-1, respectively, for graphene on SiO2/Si
substrate. Therefore, we propose that for graphene-based nanoscale devices, encapsulation with
h-BN is a better alternative to address heat management issues.

This work unravels the atomic details of the interaction of solute atoms with nanoscale crystalline
defects. The complexity of this phenomenon is elucidated through detailed atom probe tomographic
investigations on epitaxially-strained, compositionally metastable, semiconductor alloys.
Subtle variations are uncovered in the concentration and distribution of solute atoms surrounding
dislocations, and their dynamic evolution is highlighted. The results demonstrate that crystal
defects, such as dislocations, are instrumental in initiating the process of phase separation
in strained metastable layers. Matrix regions, close to the dislocations, show clear signs of compositional
degradation only after a relatively short time from disrupting the local equilibrium. The solute
concentration as well as the density of non-random atomic clusters increases while approaching
a dislocation from the surrounding matrix region. In parallel, far from a dislocation the lattice
remains intact preserving the metastable structure and composition uniformity. At advanced stages
of phase separation, the matrix outside the dislocation reaches the equilibrium concentration,
while dislocations act as vehicles of mass-transport, providing fast diffusive channels for solute
atoms to reach the surface. Besides, the number of atomic clusters almost doubles and the number
of atoms per cluster increases steadily, moving along a dislocation towards the surface. In addition
to understanding the atomic features involved in the phase separation of strained metastable alloys,
the work also illustrates the thermodynamic and kinetic behavior of solute atoms in the vicinity
of a nanoscale defect and describe quantitatively the key processes, thus providing the empirical
input to improve the atomic models and simulations.

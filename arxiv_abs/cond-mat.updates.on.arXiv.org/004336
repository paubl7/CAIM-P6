We generalize the mean-field Hartree Fock theory of gapped electronic states at charge neutrality
in bilayer graphene to thin films of rhombohedral graphite with up to thirty layers. For the ground
state, which has an odd spatial parity within each spin-valley flavor and an antiferromagnetic
arrangement of four flavors, the order parameter (the separation of bands at the valley center)
saturates to a constant non-zero value as the layer number increases, whereas the band gap decreases
with layer number. We take into account chiral symmetry breaking disorder in the form of random layer
potentials and chiral preserving disorder in the form of random values of the interlayer coupling.
The former reduces the magnitude of the mean band gap whereas the latter has a negligible effect,
which is due to self-averaging within a film with a large number of layers. We determine the ground
state in the presence of an individual stacking fault embedded within a film of rhombohedral graphite.
For a Bernal stacking fault, the ground state is also an odd parity antiferromagnetic state, and
the fault can be interpreted as introducing a small coupling between two independent sections of
rhombohedral graphite. For a twin boundary stacking fault, however, the ground state is an even
parity antiferromagnetic state, and the fault introduces stronger coupling across the system.
In the presence of stacking faults, each individual rhombohedral section with $m$ layers contributes
a pair of low-energy flat bands producing a peak in the Berry curvature located at a characteristic
$m$-dependent wave vector. For both types of stacking fault, the Chern number per spin-valley flavor
for the filled valence bands in the ground state is equal in magnitude to the total number of layers
divided by two, the same value as for pristine rhombohedral graphite.

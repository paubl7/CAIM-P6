Superlattice (SL) thin films composed of refractory ceramics unite extremely high hardness and
enhanced fracture toughness; a material combination often being mutually exclusive. While the
hardness enhancement obtained whentwo materials form a superlattice is well described by existing
models based on dislocation mobility, the underlying mechanisms behind the increase in fracture
toughness are yet to be unraveled. Here we provide a model based on linear elasticity theory to predict
the fracture toughness enhancement in (semi-)epitaxial nanolayers due to coherency stresses
and formation of misfit dislocations. We exemplarily study a superlattice structure composed
of two cubic transition metal nitrides (TiN, CrN) on a MgO (100) single-crystal substrate. Minimization
of the overall strain energy, each time a new layer is added on the nanolayered stack, allows estimating
the density of misfit dislocations formed at the interfaces. The evolving coherency stresses,
which are partly relaxed by the misfit dislocations, are then used to calculate the apparent fracture
toughness of respective SL architectures by applying the weight function method. The results show
that the critical stress intensity increases steeply with increasing bilayer period for very thin
(essentially dislocation-free) SLs, before the K_IC values decline more gently along with the
formation of misfit dislocations. The characteristic K_IC vs. bilayer-period-dependence nicely
matches experimental trends. Importantly, all critical stress intensity values of the superlattice
films clearly exceed the intrinsic fracture toughness of the constituting layer materials, evincing
the importance of coherency stresses for increasing the crack growth resistance.

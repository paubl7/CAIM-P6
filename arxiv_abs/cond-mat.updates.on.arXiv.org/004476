Colloidal gels are formed by the aggregation of Brownian particles into clusters that are, in turn,
part of a space-spanning percolated network. In practice, the microstructure of colloidal gels,
which dictates their mechanical properties, strongly depends on the particle concentration and
on the nature of their interactions. Yet another critical control parameter is the shear history
experienced by the sample, which controls the size and density of the cluster population, via particle
aggregation, cluster breakup, and restructuring. Here we investigate the impact of shear history
on acid-induced gels of boehmite, an aluminum oxide. We show that following a primary gelation,
these gels display a dual response depending on the shear rate $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}$ used to rejuvenate
their microstructure. We identify a critical shear rate $\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$, above which boehmite
gels display a gel-like viscoelastic spectrum upon flow cessation, similar to that obtained following
the primary gelation. However, upon flow cessation after shear rejuvenation below $\dot\gamma_{\rm
c}$, boehmite gels display a glassy-like viscoelastic spectrum together with enhanced elastic
properties. Moreover, the nonlinear rheological properties of boehmite gels also differ on both
sides of $\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$: weak gels obtained after rejuvenation at $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}>\dot\gamma_{\rm
c}$ show a yield strain that is constant, independent of $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}$, whereas strong gels
obtained with $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}<\dot\gamma_{\rm c}$ display a yield strain that significantly
increases with $\dot\gamma_{\rm p}$. Our results can be interpreted in light of previous literature
on shear-induced cluster densification, while we rationalize the critical shear rate in terms
of a dimensionless quantity, the Mason number, comparing the strength of the shear flow to the interparticle
bond force.

A 2D metallic phononic crystal (PnC), which is fabricated by drilling periodic holes in a suspended
niobium (Nb) film, is repeatedly cooled and warmed in the temperature range of 2--300 K. During the
first five temperature cycles, the resistance of the metallic PnC gradually increases in accordance
with the Friedel sum rule, indicating that narrow Nb bridges between adjacent thru-holes are converted
into $d$-orbital-filled Mott insulators. The consequent 2D Mott-insulating square lattice is
a crystallographic analog of a copper oxide layer in high-temperature superconductors such as
YBCO and BSCCO. Subsequent temperature cycles of the thus produced ideal Hubbard crystal realize
zero resistance at 60 K, and the zero-resistance state remains up to 300 K, being retained in the atmosphere
(i.e., at room temperature, in a terrestrial magnetic field, and under atmospheric pressure).
The necessity of the latter temperature cycles remains unclear in this study; however, a possible
transition mechanism involving the combined Josephson and charging effects is discussed. The
critical current and critical field of the room-temperature superconductor (RTSC) are $I_{C}$
= 18.8 mA and $\mu_{0}H_{\perp}$ = 12 T, respectively. Once a large current exceeding $I_{C}$ is
applied to the RTSC, some of the $d$ electrons are forced out, and a special interface consisting
of the p-type semiconducting and superconducting states is formed. Carriers diffuse because of
the nonequilibrium charge concentration, but they are Andreev-reflected back. In the reversible,
thermally isolated system, the entropy never increases, and a simple experiment confirms a low-loss
current generated from the interface spontaneously. That is, this study challenges the forbidden
perpetual motion machine which can be a solution to the World energy crisis.

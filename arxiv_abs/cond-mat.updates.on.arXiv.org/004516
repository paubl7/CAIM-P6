We study the distribution of lengths and other statistical properties of worms constructed by Monte
Carlo worm algorithms in the power-law three-sublattice ordered phase of frustrated triangular
and kagome lattice Ising antiferromagnets. Viewing each step of the worm construction as a position
increment (step) of a random walker, we demonstrate that the persistence exponent $\theta$ and
the dynamical exponent $z$ of this random walk depend only on the universal power-law exponents
of the underlying critical phase, and not on the details of the worm algorithm or the microscopic
Hamiltonian. Further, we argue that the detailed balance criterion obeyed by such worm algorithms
and the power-law correlations of the underlying equilibrium system together give rise to two related
properties of this random walk: First, the steps of the walk are expected to be power-law correlated
in time. Second, the position distribution of the walker relative to its starting point is given
by the equilibrium position distribution of a particle in an attractive logarithmic central potential
of strength $\eta_m$, where $\eta_m$ is the universal power-law exponent of the equilibrium defect-antidefect
correlation function of the underlying spin system. We derive a scaling relation, $z = (2-\eta_m)/(1-\theta)$,
that allows us to express the dynamical exponent $z(\eta_m)$ of this process in terms of its persistence
exponent $\theta(\eta_m)$. Our measurements of $z(\eta_m)$ and $\theta(\eta_m)$ are consistent
with this relation over a range of values of the universal equilibrium exponent $\eta_m$, and yield
subdiffusive ($z>2$) values of $z$ in the entire range. Thus we demonstrate that the worms represent
a discrete-time realization of a fractional Brownian motion characterized by these properties.

The extraordinary sensitivity of plasmonic sensors is well known in the optics and photonics community.
These sensors exploit simultaneously the enhancement and the localization of electromagnetic
fields close to the interface between a metal and a dielectric. This enables, for example, the design
of integrated biochemical sensors at scales far below the diffraction limit. Despite their practical
realization and successful commercialization, the sensitivity and associated precision of plasmonic
sensors are starting to reach their fundamental classical limit given by quantum fluctuations
of light -- known as the shot-noise limit. To improve the sensing performance of these sensors beyond
the classical limit, quantum resources are increasingly being employed. This area of research
has become known as `quantum plasmonic sensing' and it has experienced substantial activity in
recent years for applications in chemical and biological sensing. This review aims to cover both
plasmonic and quantum techniques for sensing, and shows how they have been merged to enhance the
performance of plasmonic sensors beyond traditional methods. We discuss the general framework
developed for quantum plasmonic sensing in recent years, covering the basic theory behind the advancements
made, and describe the important works that made these advancements. We also describe several key
works in detail, highlighting their motivation, the working principles behind them, and their
future impact. The intention of the review is to set a foundation for a burgeoning field of research
that is currently being explored out of intellectual curiosity and for a wide range of practical
applications in biochemistry, medicine, and pharmaceutical research.

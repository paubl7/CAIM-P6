The 3$d$-5$d$ based double perovskites offer an ideal playground to study the interplay between
electron correlation ($U$) and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) effect, showing exotic physics. The
Sr$_2$FeIrO$_6$ is an interesting member in this family with ionic distribution of Fe$^{3+}$ (3$d^5$)
and Ir$^{5+}$ (5$d^4$) where the later is believed to be nonmagnetic under the picture of strong
SOC. Here, we report detailed investigation of structural, magnetic and electronic transport
properties along with electronic structure calculations in (Sr$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$)$_2$FeIrO$_6$
series with $x$ from 0 to 1. While the basic interactions such as, $U$ and SOC are unlikely to be modified
but a structural modification is expected due to ionic size difference between Sr$^{2+}$ and Ca$^{2+}$
which would influence other properties such as crystal field effect and band widths. While a nonmonotonic
changes in lattice parameters are observed across the series, the spectroscopic investigations
reveal that 3+/5+ charge state of Fe/Ir continue till end of the series. An analysis of magnetic data
suggests similar nonmonotonic evolution of magnetic parameters with doping. Temperature dependent
crystal structure as well as low temperature (5 K) magnetic structure have been determined from
neutron powder diffraction measurements. The whole series shows insulating behavior. The electronic
structure calculations show, SOC enhanced, a noncollinear antiferromagnetic and Mott-type insulating
state is the stable ground state for present series with a substantial amount of orbital moment,
but less than the spin magnetic moment, at the Ir site and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy. The
obtained results imply that the Ca$^{2+}$ has large influence on the magnetic and transport properties,
further showing a large agreement between experimental results as well as theoretical calculations.

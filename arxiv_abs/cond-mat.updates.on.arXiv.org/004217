Thermal transport in topologically-ordered phases of matter provides valuable insights as it
can detect the charge-neutral quasiparticles that would not directly couple to electromagnetic
probes. An important example is edge heat transport of Majorana fermions in a chiral spin liquid,
which leads to a half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity. This signature is precisely what has
recently been measured in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ under external magnetic fields. The plateau-like
behavior of the half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity as a function of external magnetic field,
and the peculiar sign change depending on the magnetic field orientation, has been proposed as strong
evidence for the non-Abelian Kitaev spin liquid. Alternatively, for in-plane magnetic fields,
it was theoretically shown that such a sign structure can also arise from topological magnons in
the field-polarized state. In this work, we investigate the full implications of topological magnons
as heat carriers on thermal transport measurements. We first prove analytically that for any commensurate
order with a finite magnetic unit cell, reversing the field direction leads to a sign change in the
magnon thermal Hall conductivity in two-dimensional systems. We verify this proof numerically
with nontrivial magnetic orders as well as the field-polarized state in Kitaev magnets subjected
to an in-plane field. In the case of a tilted magnetic field, whereby there exist both finite in-plane
and out-of-plane field components, we find that the plateau-like behavior of the thermal Hall conductivity
and the sign change upon reversing the in-plane component of the magnetic field arise in the partially-polarized
state, as long as the in-plane field contribution to the Zeeman energy is significant. While these
results are consistent with the experimental observations, we comment on other aspects requiring
investigation in future studies.

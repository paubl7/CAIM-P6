A thermodynamic framework has been developed for a class of amorphous polymers used in fused deposition
modeling (FDM), in order to predict the residual stresses and the accompanying distortion of the
geometry of the printed part (warping). When a polymeric melt is cooled, the inhomogeneous distribution
of temperature causes spatially varying volumetric shrinkage resulting in the generation of residual
stresses. Shrinkage is incorporated into the framework by introducing an isotropic volumetric
expansion/contraction in the kinematics of the body. We show that the parameter for shrinkage also
appears in the systematically derived rate-type constitutive relation for the stress. The solidification
of the melt around the glass transition temperature is emulated by drastically increasing the viscosity
of the melt. In order to illustrate the usefulness and efficacy of the derived constitutive relation,
we consider four ribbons of polymeric melt stacked on each other such as those extruded using a flat
nozzle: each layer laid instantaneously and allowed to cool for one second before another layer
is laid on it. Each layer cools, shrinks and warps until a new layer is laid, at which time the heat from
the newly laid layer flows and heats up the bottom layers. The residual stresses of the existing and
newly laid layers readjust to satisfy equilibrium. Such mechanical and thermal interactions amongst
layers result in a complex distribution of residual stresses. The plane strain approximation predicts
nearly equibiaxial tensile stress conditions in the core region of the solidified part, implying
that a pre-existing crack in that region is likely to propagate and cause failure of the part during
service. The free-end of the interface between the first and the second layer is subjected to the
largest magnitude of combined shear and tension in the plane with a propensity for delamination.

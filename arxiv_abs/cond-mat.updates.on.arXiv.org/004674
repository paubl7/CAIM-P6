Magnets with frustration often show accidental degeneracies, characterized by a large classical
ground-state space (CGSS). Quantum fluctuations may `select' one of these ground states -- a phenomenon
labeled `order by (quantum) disorder' in literature. In this article, we examine the mechanism(s)
by which such state selection takes place. We argue that a magnet, at low energies, maps to a particle
moving on the CGSS. State selection corresponds to localization of the particle at a certain point
on this space. We distinguish two mechanisms that can bring about localization. In the first, quantum
fluctuations generate a potential on the CGSS. If the potential has a deep enough minimum, then the
particle localizes in its vicinity. We denote this as `order by potential' (ObP). In the second scenario,
the particle localizes at a self-intersection point due to bound-state formation -- a consequence
of geometry and quantum interference. Following recent studies by the present authors, we denote
this scenario as `order by singularity' (ObS). We place our discussion within the context of the
one-dimensional spin-$S$ Kitaev model. We map out its CGSS which grows systematically with increasing
system size. It resembles a network where the number of nodes increases exponentially. In addition,
the number of wires that cross at each node also grows exponentially. This self-intersecting structure
leads to ObS, with the low-energy physics determined by a small subset of the CGSS, consisting of
`Cartesian' states. A contrasting picture emerges when an additional XY antiferromagnetic coupling
is introduced. The CGSS simplifies dramatically, taking the form of a circle. Spin-wave fluctuations
generate a potential on this space, giving rise to state selection by ObP under certain conditions.
Apart from contrasting ObS and ObP, we discuss the possibility of ObS in macroscopic magnets.

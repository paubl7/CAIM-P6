Preparation of nanoemulsions of triglyceride oils in water usually requires high mechanical energy
and sophisticated equipment. Recently, we showed that alpha-to-beta (viz. gel-to-crystal) phase
transition, observed with most lipid substances (triglycerides, diglycerides, phospholipids,
alkanes, etc.), may cause spontaneous disintegration of micro-particles of these lipids, dispersed
in aqueous solutions of appropriate surfactants, into nanometer particles/drops using a simple
cooling/heating cycle of the lipid dispersion (Cholakova et al. ACS Nano 14 (2020) 8594). In the
current study we show that this "cold-burst process" is observed also with natural oils of high practical
interest, incl. coconut oil, palm kernel oil and cocoa butter. Mean drop diameters of ca. 50 to 100
nm were achieved with some of the studied oils. From the results of dedicated model experiments we
conclude that intensive nano-fragmentation is observed when the following requirements are met:
(1) The three phase contact angle at the air-water-solid lipid interface is below ca. 30 degrees;
(2) The equilibrium surface tension of the surfactant solution is below ca. 30 mN/m and the dynamic
surface tension decreases rapidly. (3) The surfactant solution contains non-spherical surfactant
micelles. e.g. ellipsoidal micelles or bigger supramolecular aggregates; (4) The three phase
contact angle measured at the contact line (frozen oil-melted oil-surfactant solution) is also
relatively low. The mechanism(s) of the particle bursting process is revealed and, on this basis,
the role of all these factors is clarified and discussed. We explain all main effects observed experimentally
and define guiding principles for optimization of the cold-burst process in various, practically
relevant lipid-surfactant systems.

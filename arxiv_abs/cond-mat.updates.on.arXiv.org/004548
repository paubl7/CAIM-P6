Order strengthening in nickel-based superalloys is associated with the extra stress required
for dislocations to bypass the $\gamma'$ precipitates distributed in the $\gamma$ matrix. A rich
variety of bypass mechanism has been identified, with various shearing and Orowan looping processes
giving way to climb bypass as the operating conditions change from the low/intermediate temperatures
and high stress regime, to the high temperature and low stress regime. When anti phase boundary (APB)
shearing and Orowan looping mechanisms operate, the bypass mechanism changes from shearing to
looping with increased particle size and within a broad coexistence size window. Another possibility,
supported by indirect experimental evidence, is that a third "hybrid" transition mechanism may
operate. In this paper we use discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations to study dislocation
bypass mechanisms in Ni-based superalloys. We develop a new method to compute generalized stacking
fault forces in DDD simulations. We use this method to study the mechanisms of bypass of a square lattice
of spherical $\gamma'$ precipitates by $a/2\langle110\rangle\{111\}$ edge dislocations, as
a function of the precipitates volume fraction and size. We show that the hybrid mechanism is possible
and it operates as a transition mechanism between the shearing and looping regimes over a large range
of precipitates volume fraction and radii. We also consider the effects of a $\gamma/\gamma'$ lattice
misfit on the bypass mechanisms, which we approximate by an additional precipitate stress computed
according to Eshelby's inclusion theory. We show that in the shearing and hybrid looping-shearing
regimes, a lattice misfit generally results in an increased bypass stress. For sufficiently high
lattice misfit, the bypass stress is controlled by the pinning of the trailing dislocation on the
exit side of the precipitates.

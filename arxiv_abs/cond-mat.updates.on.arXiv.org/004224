The dynamical properties of free and bound domain-wall excitations in Ising-chain materials have
recently become the focus of intense research interest. New materials and spectrometers have made
it possible to control the environment of coupled Ising chains by both effective internal and applied
external fields, which can be both longitudinal and transverse, and thus to demonstrate how the
resulting magnetic phase transitions and the nature of the associated excited states obey fundamental
symmetry properties. In RbCoCl$_3$, the weakly coupled Ising chains form a triangular lattice
whose frustrated geometry and magnetic ordering transitions at low temperature open new possibilities
for the Ising-chain environment. We have investigated the structure and magnetism in RbCoCl$_3$
by high-resolution x-ray diffraction and neutron scattering measurements on powder and single
crystal samples between 1.5 K and 300 K. Upon cooling, the Co$^{2+}$ spins develop one-dimensional
antiferromagnetic correlations along the chain axis ($c$-axis) below 90 K. Below the first N\'eel
temperature, $T_{N1}$ = 28 K, a partial 3D magnetic order sets in, with propagation vector ${\vec
k}_1$ = (1/3,1/3,1), the moments aligned along the $c$-axis and every third chain uncorrelated
from its neighbours. Only below a second magnetic phase transition at $T_{N2}$ = 13 K does the system
achieve a fully ordered state, with two additional propagation vectors: ${\vec k}_2$ = (0,0,1)
establishes a "honeycomb" $c$-axis order, in which 1/3 of the chains are subject to a strong effective
mean field due to their neighbours whereas 2/3 experience no net field, while ${\vec k}_3$ = (1/2,0,1)
governs a small, staggered in-plane ordered moment. We conclude that RbCoCl$_3$ is an excellent
material to study the physics of Ising chains in a wide variety of temperature-controlled environments.

Density functional theory (DFT) is an efficient instrument for describing a wide range of nanoscale
phenomena: wetting transition, capillary condensation, adsorption, etc. In this paper, we suggest
a method for obtaining the equilibrium molecular fluid density in a nanopore using DFT without calculating
the free energy variation - Variation Free Density Functional Theory (VF-DFT). This technique
can be used to explore confined fluids with a complex type of interactions, additional constraints
and to speed up calculations, which might be crucial in an inverse problems. The fluid density in
VF-DFT approach is represented as a decomposition over a limited set of basis functions. We applied
Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to extract the basic patterns from the density function and
take them into account in the construction of a set of basis functions. The decomposition coefficients
of the fluid density by the basis were sought by stochastic optimization algorithms: genetic algorithm
(GA), particle swarm optimization (PSO) to minimize the free energy of the system. In this work,
two different fluids were studied: nitrogen at a temperature of 77.4 K and argon 87.3 K, at a pore of
3.6 nm, and the performance of optimization algorithms was compared. We also introduce the Hybrid
Density Functional Theory (H-DFT) approach based on stochastic optimization methods and the classical
Picard iteration method to find the equilibrium fluid density starting from the physically appropriate
solution. The combination of Picard iteration and stochastic algorithms helps to significantly
speed up the calculations of equilibrium density in the system without losing the quality of the
solution, especially in cases with the high relative pressure and expressed layering structure.

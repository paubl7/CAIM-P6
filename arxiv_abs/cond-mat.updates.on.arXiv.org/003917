We study mechanisms of control of charge state and concentration of different point defects in doped
insulating crystals. The approach is based on the density functional theory calculations. We apply
it to the problem of obtaining of Ti-doped sapphire crystals with high figure-of-merit (FOM). The
FOM of a given sample is defined as the ratio of the coefficient of absorption at the pump frequency
to the coefficient of absorption at the working frequency of Ti:sapphire laser. It is believed that
FOM is proportional to the ratio of the concentration of isolated Ti$^{3+}$ ions to the concentration
of Ti$^{3+}$-Ti$^{4+}$ pairs. We find that generally this ratio is in inverse proportion to the
concentration of Ti$^{4+}$ isolated substitutional defects with the coefficient of proportionality
that depends on the temperature at which the thermodynamically equilibrium concentration of defects
is reached. We argue that in certain cases the inverse proportion between concentrations of Ti$^{3+}$-Ti$^{4+}$
and Ti$^{4+}$ may be violated. We show that codopants that form positively (negatively) charged
defects may decrease (increase) the concentration of positively charged defects formed by the
main dopants. To evaluate the effect of codoping it is important to take into account not only isolated
defects but defect complexes formed by codopants, as well. In particular, we show that codoping
of Ti:sapphire with nitrogen results in an essential increase of the concentration of Ti$^{4+}$
and in a decrease of the FOM, and, consequently, growth or annealing in the presence of nitrogen or
its compounds is unfavorable for producing Ti:sapphire laser crystals. The approach developed
can be used for determining appropriate growth and annealing conditions for obtaining doped crystals
with the required characteristics.

Knowledge of relaxation processes is fundamental in glass science and technology because relaxation
is intrinsically related to vitrification, tempering as well as to annealing and sev-eral applications
of glasses. However, there are conflicting reports -- summarized here for different glasses --
on whether the structural relaxation time of glass can be calculated using the Maxwell equation,
which relates relaxation time with shear viscosity and shear modulus. Hence, this study aimed to
verify whether these two relaxation times are comparable. The structural relaxation kinetics
of a lead metasilicate glass were studied by measuring the re-fractive index variation over time
at temperatures between 5 and 25 K below the fictive temperature, which was initially set 5 K below
the glass transition temperature. Equilibrium shear viscosity was measured above and below the
glass transition range, expanding the current knowledge by one order of magnitude. The Kohlrausch
equation described very well the experimental structural relaxation kinetics throughout the
investigated temperature range and the Kohlrausch exponent increased with temperature, in agreement
with studies on other glasses. The experimental average structural relaxation times were much
longer than the values computed from isostructural viscosity, as expected. Still, they were less
than one order of magnitude higher than the average relaxation time computed through the Maxwell
equation, which relies on equilibrium shear viscosity. Thus, these results demon-strate that
the structural relaxation process is not controlled by isostructural viscosity, and that equilibrium
shear viscosity only provides a lower boundary for structural relaxation kinetics.

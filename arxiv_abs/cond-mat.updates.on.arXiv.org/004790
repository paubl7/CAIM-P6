Transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have been a core constituent of 2D material research throughout
the last decade. Over this time, research focus has progressively shifted from synthesis and fundamental
investigations, to exploring their properties for applied research such as electrochemical applications
and integration in electrical devices. Due to the rapid pace of development, priority is often given
to application-oriented aspects while careful characterisation and analysis of the TMD materials
themselves is occasionally neglected. This can be particularly evident for characterisations
involving X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), where measurement, peak-fitting, and analysis
can be complex and nuanced endeavours requiring specific expertise. To improve the availability
and accessibility of reference information, here we present a detailed peak-fitted XPS analysis
of ten transition metal chalcogenides. The materials were synthesised as large-area thin-films
on SiO2 using direct chalcogenisation of pre-deposited metal films. Alongside XPS, the Raman spectra
with several excitation wavelengths for each material are also provided. These complementary
characterisation methods can provide a more complete understanding of the composition and quality
of the material. As material stability is a crucial factor when considering applications, the in-air
thermal stability of the TMDs was investigated after several annealing points up to 400 {\deg}C.
This delivers a trend of evolving XPS and Raman spectra for each material which improves interpretation
of their spectra while also indicating their ambient thermal limits. This provides an accessible
library and set of guidelines to characterise, compare, and discuss TMD XPS and Raman spectra.

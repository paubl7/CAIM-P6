Poly-L-lactide (PLLA) is a popular choice for medical devices due to its bioresorbability and superior
mechanical properties compared with other polymers. However, although PLLA has been investigated
for use in bioresorbable cardiovascular stents, it presents application-specific limitations
which hamper device therapies. These include low toughness and strength compared with metals used
for this purpose, and slow degradation. Blending PLLA with novel polyethylene glycol functionalised
poly(L-lactide-co-$\varepsilon$-caprolactone) (PLCL-PEG) materials has been investigated
here to tailor the mechanical properties and degradation behaviour of PLLA. This exciting approach
provides a foundation for a next generation of bioresorbable materials whose properties can be
rapidly tuned. The degradation of PLLA was significantly accelerated by addition of PLCL-PEG.
After 30 days of degradation, several structural changes were observed in the polymer blends, which
were dependent on the level of PLCL-PEG addition. Blends with low PLCL-PEG content displayed enthalpy
relaxation, resulting in embrittlement, while blends with high PLCL-PEG content displayed crystallisation,
due to enhanced chain mobility brought on by chain scission, also causing embrittlement. Moderate
PLCL-PEG additions (10% PLCL(70:30)-PEG and 20 - 30% PLCL(80:20)-PEG) stabilised the structure,
reducing the extent of enthalpy relaxation and crystallisation and thus retaining ductility.
Compositional optimisation identified a sweet spot for this blend strategy, whereby the ductility
was enhanced while maintaining strength. Our results indicate that blending PLLA with PLCL-PEG
provides an effective method of tuning the degradation timescale and mechanical properties of
PLLA, and provides important new insight into the mechanisms of structural relaxations that occur
during degradation, and strategies for regulating these.

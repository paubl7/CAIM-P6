Electron spins are amongst the most coherent solid-state systems known, however, to be used in devices
for quantum sensing and information processing applications, they must be typically placed near
interfaces. Understanding and mitigating the impacts of such interfaces on the coherence and spectral
properties of electron spins is critical to realize such applications, but is also challenging:
inferring such data from single-spin studies requires many measurements to obtain meaningful
results, while ensemble measurements typically give averaged results that hide critical information.
Here, we report a comprehensive study of the coherence of near-surface bismuth donor spins in 28-silicon
at millikelvin temperatures. In particular, we use strain-induced frequency shifts caused by
a metallic electrode to make spatial maps of spin coherence as a function of depth and position relative
to the electrode. By measuring magnetic-field-insensitive clock transitions we separate magnetic
noise caused by surface spins from charge noise. Our results include quantitative models of the
strain-split spin resonance spectra and extraction of paramagnetic impurity concentrations
at the silicon surface. The interplay of these decoherence mechanisms for such near-surface electron
spins is critical for their application in quantum technologies, while the combination of the strain
splitting and clock transition extends the coherence lifetimes by up to two orders of magnitude,
reaching up to 300 ms at a mean depth of only 100nm. The technique we introduce here to spatially map
coherence in near-surface ensembles is directly applicable to other spin systems of active interest,
such as defects in diamond, silicon carbide, and rare earth ions in optical crystals.

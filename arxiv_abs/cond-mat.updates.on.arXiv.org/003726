Sophorolipids are one of the most important microbial biosurfactants, because of their large-scale
production and applications developed so far in the fields of detergency, microbiology, cosmetics
or environmental science. However, the structural variety of native sophorolipids is limited/restricted,
a limiting fact for the development of new properties and their potential applications. In their
open acidic form, C18:1 sophorolipids (SL) are classically composed of a sophorose headgroup and
a carboxylic acid (COOH) end-group. The carboxyl group gives them unique pH-responsive properties,
but they are a poorly-reactive group and their charge can only be negative. To develop a new generation
of pH-responsive, positively-charged, SL and to improve their reactivity for further functionalization,
we develop here SLs with an amine (-NH2) or terminal alkyne (-C$\not\equiv$CH) end-group analogues.
The amine group generates positively-charged SL and is more reactive than carboxylic acids, e.g.
towards aldehydes; the alkyne group provides access to copper-based click chemistry. In this work,
we synthesize (C18:1) and (C18:0) --NH2 and (C18:1) -C$\not\equiv$CH sophorolipid derivatives
and we study their self-assembly properties in response to pH and/or temperature changes by means
of static and dynamic light scattering, small angle (X-ray, neutron) scattering and cryogenic
electron microscopy. Monounsaturated aminyl SL-C18:1-NH2 sophorolipids form a micellar phase
in their neutral form at high pH and a mixed micellar-bilayer phase in their positively-charged
form at low pH. Saturated aminyl SL-C18:0-NH2 sophorolipids form a micellar phase in their charged
form at low pH and a twisted ribbon phase in their neutral form at high pH and monounsaturated alkynyl
SL-C18:1-C$\not\equiv$CH sophorolipids form a main micellar phase at T> 51.8{\textdegree}C
and a twisted ribbon phase at T< 51.8 {\textdegree}C.

We examine the motion of an individual skyrmion driven through an assembly of other skyrmions by
a constant or increasing force in the absence of quenched disorder. The skyrmion behavior is determined
by the ratio of the damping and Magnus terms, as expressed in terms of the intrinsic skyrmion Hall
angle. For a fixed driving force in the damping dominated regime, the effective viscosity decreases
monotonically with increasing skyrmion density, similar to what is observed in overdamped systems
where it becomes difficult for the driven particle to traverse the surrounding medium at high densities.
In contrast, in the Magnus dominated regime the velocity dependence on the density is nonmonotonic,
and there is a regime in which the skyrmion moves faster with increasing density, as well as a pronounced
speed-up effect in which a skyrmion traveling through a dense medium moves more rapidly than it would
at low densities or in the single particle limit. At higher densities, the effective damping increases
and the velocity decreases. The velocity-force curves in the Magnus-dominated regime show marked
differences from those in the damping-dominated regimes. Under an increasing drive we find that
there is a threshold force for skyrmion motion which increases with density. Additionally, the
skyrmion Hall angle is drive dependent, starting near zero at the threshold for motion and increasing
with increasing drive before reaching a saturation value, similar to the behavior found for skyrmions
driven over quenched disorder. We map dynamic phase diagrams showing the threshold for motion,
nonlinear flow, speed-up, and saturation regimes. We also find that in some cases, increasing the
density can reduce the skyrmion Hall angle while producing a velocity boost, which could be valuable
for applications.

A directed narrow jet of an organo-metallic gas containing a heavy metal can be decomposed by an accelerated
beam of gallium ions, leaving behind a track made up of a complex residue of gallium, heavy metal and
carbon. The process is highly controllable and in certain cases, the residue has remarkable superconducting
properties, like an upper critical field ($H_{c2} \sim 10~{\rm T} $) that is higher than the paramagnetic
limit. Werthamer-Helfand-Hohenberg (WHH) analysis shows the presence of moderate spin-orbit
(SO) scattering and a Maki parameter compatible with unconventional (e.g., FFLO-like) superconducting
states. Using a spatially resolved mass spectrometric technique (Atomic probe tomography), we
show that the possible origin of the SO effects lies in the formation of nano-crystalline tungsten
carbide (WC) with a possible non-centrosymmetric crystal structure. We also show that when Ga is
distributed on the surface of nano-crystallite WC, the sp-orbitals of Ga give rise to bands with
a significant density of states near the Fermi energy. The superconductor is in the dirty limit where
the mean free path ($l$) is much smaller than the zero temperature coherence length, i.e., $l\ll\xi_{0}~{\approx}~5{~\rm
nm}$. Low-temperature magnetotransport with {\em in-situ} rotation of the sample in a magnetic
field shows clear anisotropic effects that weaken as the width of the tracks are increased from $\sim~100{~\rm
nm}$ to $\sim~1{~ {\mu}\rm m}$ [Phys. Rev. B 103, L020504, 2021]. The combination of the transition
temperature ($T_c~{\approx}~5~ {\rm K}$), the critical field $H_{c2} \geq 10~ {\rm T}$ and nanometer-scale
patternability of these tracks make them an attractive component for engineered mesoscopic structures.

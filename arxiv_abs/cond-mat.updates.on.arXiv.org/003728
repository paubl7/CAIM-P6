Isolation of symptomatic individuals, together with tracing and testing of their nonsymptomatic
contacts, is a fundamental strategy for mitigating the current COVID-19 pandemic before pharmaceutical
interventions become available. The breaking of contagion chains relies on two main alternative
strategies: manual reconstruction of contacts based on interviews or a digital (app-based) privacy-preserving
contact tracing protocol. We compare in the same framework the effectiveness of the two strategies
within the activity-driven model, a general empirically validated framework for network dynamics.
Using model parameters tailored to describe SARS-CoV-2 diffusion, we show that even when the probability
for a contact to be traced is the same, manual contact tracing robustly performs better than the digital
protocol in increasing the epidemic threshold, limiting the height of the epidemic peaks and reducing
the number of isolated individuals. This remains true even taking into account the intrinsic delay
and limited scalability of the manual procedure. This result is explained in terms of the stochastic
sampling occurring during the case-by-case manual reconstruction of contacts of infected individuals,
contrasted with the intrinsically prearranged nature of digital tracing, determined by the decision
to adopt the app or not of each individual. The better performance of manual tracing is enhanced by
the heterogeneous features of agent behavior: a superspreader not adopting the app is completely
invisible to digital contact tracing, while she can be traced manually, due to her multiple contacts.
Our results indicate a careful integration of the two intrinsically different protocols as key
to optimal mitigation strategies.

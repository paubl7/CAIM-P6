Van der Waals heterostructures are constructed by stacking different atomic layers and can inherit
many novel electronic and optical properties from the constituting atomic layers. Mechanical
stability is of key importance for the high performance of nano devices based on the van der Waals
heterostructure. In particular, buckling instability is a critical mechanical issue for the heterostructure
due to its two-dimensional nature. Using graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructure as an example, the
present work demonstrates the relationship between the buckling instability and the inevitable
misfit strain in the heterostructure by molecular dynamics simulations. The misfit strain has
rather different effects on the buckling phenomenon depending on the magnitude of the misfit strain.
(1) For negative misfit strain, the buckling stability of the heterostructure is reduced by the
misfit strain. It is because the graphene layer, which initiates the buckling process in the heterostructure
of negative misfit strain, is pre-compressed by the misfit strain that accelerates the buckling
of the graphene layer. (2) For small positive misfit strain, the buckling stability for the graphene/MoS$_2$
heterostructure is elevated. The underlying mechanism is that the graphene layer initiates the
buckling process of the heterostructure and is pre-stretched by the small positive misfit strain,
which decelerates the buckling of the graphene layer. (3) For large positive misfit strain, the
graphene layer is pre-stretched while the MoS$_2$ layer is considerably pre-compressed, so the
buckling of the heterostructure is initiated by the MoS$_2$ layer. As a consequence, the buckling
stability of the graphene/MoS$_2$ heterostructure is reduced by the increase of large positive
misfit strain. These findings shall be valuable for understanding mechanical properties of van
der Waals heterostructures.

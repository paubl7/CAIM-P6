Crystal structure prediction is one of the major unsolved problems in materials science. Traditionally,
this problem is formulated as a global optimization problem for which global search algorithms
are combined with first principle free energy calculations to predict the ground-state crystal
structure given only a material composition or a chemical system. These ab initio algorithms usually
cannot exploit a large amount of implicit physicochemical rules or geometric constraints (deep
knowledge) of atom configurations embodied in a large number of known crystal structures. Inspired
by the deep learning enabled breakthrough in protein structure prediction, herein we propose AlphaCrystal,
a crystal structure prediction algorithm that combines a deep residual neural network model that
learns deep knowledge to guide predicting the atomic contact map of a target crystal material followed
by reconstructing its 3D crystal structure using genetic algorithms. Based on the experiments
of a selected set of benchmark crystal materials, we show that our AlphaCrystal algorithm can predict
structures close to the ground truth structures. It can also speed up the crystal structure prediction
process by predicting and exploiting the predicted contact map so that it has the potential to handle
relatively large systems. We believe that our deep learning based ab initio crystal structure prediction
method that learns from existing material structures can be used to scale up current crystal structure
prediction practice. To our knowledge, AlphaCrystal is the first neural network based algorithm
for crystal structure contact map prediction and the first method for directly reconstructing
crystal structures from materials composition, which can be further optimized by DFT calculations.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) provides uniform and conformal thin films that are of interest for
a range of applications. To better understand the properties of amorphous ALD films, we need improved
understanding of their local atomic structure. Previous work demonstrated measurement of how
the local atomic structure of ALD-grown aluminum oxide (AlOx) evolves in operando during growth
by employing synchrotron high energy X-ray diffraction (HE-XRD). In this work, we report on efforts
to employ electron diffraction pair distribution function (ePDF) measurements using more broadly
available transmission electron microscope (TEM) instrumentation to study the atomic structure
of amorphous ALD-AlOx. We observe electron beam damage in the ALD-coated samples during ePDF at
ambient temperature and successfully mitigate this beam damage using ePDF at cryogenic temperatures
(cryo-ePDF). We employ cryo-ePDF and Reverse Monte Carlo (RMC) modeling to obtain structural models
of ALD-AlOx coatings formed at a range of deposition temperatures from 150-332{\deg}C. From these
model structures, we derive structural metrics including stoichiometry, pair distances, and
coordination environments in the ALD-AlOx films as a function of deposition temperature. The structural
variations we observe with growth temperature are consistent with temperature-dependent changes
in the surface hydroxyl density on the growth surface. The sample preparation and cryo-ePDF procedures
we report here can be used for routine measurement of ALD-grown amorphous thin films to improve our
understanding of the atomic structure of these materials, establish structure-property relationships,
and help accelerate the timescale for the application of ALD to address technological needs.

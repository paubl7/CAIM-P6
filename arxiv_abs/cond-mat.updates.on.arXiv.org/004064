The field of thermoelectric materials has undergone a revolutionary transformation over the last
couple of decades as a result of the ability to nanostructure and synthesize myriads of materials
and their alloys. The ZT figure of merit, which quantifies the performance of a thermoelectric material
has more than doubled after decades of inactivity, reaching values larger than two, consistently
across materials and temperatures. Central to this ZT improvement is the drastic reduction in the
material thermal conductivity due to the scattering of phonons on the numerous interfaces, boundaries,
dislocations, point defects, phases, etc., which are purposely included. In these new generation
of nanostructured materials, phonon scattering centers of different sizes and geometrical configurations
(atomic, nano- and macro-scale) are formed, which are able to scatter phonons of mean-free-paths
across the spectrum. Beyond thermal conductivity reductions, ideas are beginning to emerge on
how to use similar hierarchical nanostructuring to achieve power factor improvements. Ways that
relax the adverse interdependence of the electrical conductivity and Seebeck coefficient are
targeted, which allows power factor improvements. For this, elegant designs are required, that
utilize for instance non-uniformities in the underlying nanostructured geometry, non-uniformities
in the dopant distribution, or potential barriers that form at boundaries between materials. A
few recent reports, both theoretical and experimental, indicate that extremely high power factor
values can be achieved, even for the same geometries that also provide ultra-low thermal conductivities.
Despite the experimental complications that can arise in having the required control in nanostructure
realization, in this colloquium, we aim to demonstrate, mostly theoretically, that it is a very
promising path worth exploring.

Atomic layer deposition (ALD) is an essential tool in semiconductor device fabrication that allows
the growth of ultrathin and conformal films to precisely form heterostructures and tune interface
properties. The self-limiting nature of the chemical reactions during ALD provides excellent
control over the layer thickness. However, in contrast to idealized growth models, it is experimentally
challenging to create continuous monolayers by ALD because surface inhomogeneities and precursor
steric interactions result in island growth during film nucleation. Thus, the ability to create
pin-hole free monolayers by ALD would offer new opportunities for controlling interfacial charge
and mass transport in semiconductor devices, as well as for tailoring surface chemistry. Here,
we report full encapsulation of c-plane gallium nitride (GaN) with an ultimately thin (~3 {\AA})
aluminum oxide (AlOx) monolayer, which is enabled by the partial conversion of the GaN surface oxide
into AlOx using a combination of trimethylaluminum deposition and hydrogen plasma exposure. Introduction
of monolayer AlOx significantly modifies the physical and chemical properties of the surface,
decreasing the work function and introducing new chemical reactivity to the GaN surface. This tunable
interfacial chemistry is highlighted by the reactivity of the modified surface with phosphonic
acids under standard conditions, which results in self-assembled monolayers with densities approaching
the theoretical limit. More broadly, the presented monolayer AlOx deposition scheme can be extended
to other dielectrics and III-V-based semiconductors, with significant relevance for applications
in optoelectronics, chemical sensing, and (photo)electrocatalysis.

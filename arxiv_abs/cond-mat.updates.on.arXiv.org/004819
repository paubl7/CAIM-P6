The Wigner crystal state, first predicted by Eugene Wigner in 1934, has fascinated condensed matter
physicists for nearly 90 years2-14. Studies of two-dimensional (2D) electron gases first revealed
signatures of the Wigner crystal in electrical transport measurements at high magnetic fields2-4.
More recently optical spectroscopy has provided evidence of generalized Wigner crystal states
in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMDC) moir\'e superlattices. Direct observation of the 2D
Wigner crystal lattice in real space, however, has remained an outstanding challenge. Scanning
tunneling microscopy (STM) in principle has sufficient spatial resolution to image a Wigner crystal,
but conventional STM measurements can potentially alter fragile Wigner crystal states in the process
of measurement. Here we demonstrate real-space imaging of 2D Wigner crystals in WSe2/WS2 moir\'e
heterostructures using a novel non-invasive STM spectroscopy technique. We employ a graphene
sensing layer in close proximity to the WSe2/WS2 moir\'e superlattice for Wigner crystal imaging,
where local STM tunneling current into the graphene sensing layer is modulated by the underlying
electron lattice of the Wigner crystal in the WSe2/WS2 heterostructure. Our measurement directly
visualizes different lattice configurations associated with Wigner crystal states at fractional
electron fillings of n = 1/3, 1/2, and 2/3, where n is the electron number per site. The n=1/3 and n=2/3
Wigner crystals are observed to exhibit a triangle and a honeycomb lattice, respectively, in order
to minimize nearest-neighbor occupations. The n = 1/2 state, on the other hand, spontaneously breaks
the original C3 symmetry and forms a stripe structure in real space. Our study lays a solid foundation
toward the fundamental understanding of rich Wigner crystal states in WSe2/WS2 moir\'e heterostructures.

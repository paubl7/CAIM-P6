Monte Carlo simulations are used to study the translocation of a polymer into a cavity. Modeling
the polymer as a hard-sphere chain with a length up to N=601 monomers, we use a multiple-histogram
method to measure the variation of the conformational free energy of the polymer with respect to
the number of translocated monomers. The resulting free-energy functions are then used to obtain
the confinement free energy for the translocated portion of the polymer. We characterize the confinement
free energy for a flexible polymer in cavities with constant cross-sectional area A for various
cavity shapes (cylindrical, rectangular and triangular) as well as for tapered cavities with pyramidal
and conical shape. The scaling of the free energy with cavity volume and translocated polymer subchain
length is generally consistent with predictions from simple scaling arguments, with small deviations
in the scaling exponents likely due to finite-size effects. The confinement free energy depends
strongly on cavity shape anisometry and is a minimum for an isometric cavity shape with a length/width
ratio of unity. For translocation into infinitely long cones, the scaling of the free energy with
taper angle is consistent with a theoretical prediction employing the blob model. We also examine
the effects of polymer bending rigidity on the translocation free energy for cylindrical cavities.
For isometric cavities, the observed scaling behaviour is in partial agreement with theoretical
predictions. In addition, translocation into highly anisometric cylindrical cavities leads
to a multi-stage folding process for stiff polymers. Finally, we examine the effects of crowding
agents inside the cavity. We find that the confinement free energy increases with crowder density.
At constant packing fraction the magnitude of this effect lessens with increasing crowder size
for crowder/monomer size ratio$\geq$ 1.

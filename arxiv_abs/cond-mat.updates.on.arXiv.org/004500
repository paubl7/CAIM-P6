Graphene-based nanofolds (GNFs) are edge-connected 2D stacked monolayers originated from single-layer
graphene. Graphene-based nanoscrolls (GNSs) are nanomaterials with geometry resembling graphene
layers rolled up into a spiral (papyrus-like) form. Both GNSs and GNFs structures induce significant
changes in the mechanical and optoelectronic properties of single-layer graphene, aggregating
new functionalities in carbon-based applications. Here, we carried our fully atomistic reactive
(ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations to study the competition between self-folding and self-scrolling
of a graphene sheet. We adopted initial edge-scrolled graphene (ESG($\phi$,$\theta$)) structures
with similar (or different) twist angles ($\phi$,$\theta$) in each edge, mimicking the initial
configuration that was experimentally developed to form biscrolled sheets. Results showed that
ESG(0,$2\pi$) and ESG(2$\pi$,$2\pi$) evolved to single-folded and two-folded fully stacked
morphologies, respectively. As a general trend, for twist angles higher than $2\pi$, the self-deformation
process of ESG morphologies yields GNSs. Edge twist angles lower than $\pi$ are not enough for triggering
the self-deformation processes. In the ESG(0,3$\pi$) and ESG(3$\pi$,3$\pi$) cases, after a relaxation
period, their morphology transition towards GNS occurred rapidly. In the ESG(3$\pi$,3$\pi$)
dynamics, a metastable biscroll was formed by the competition between the left- and right-sided
partial scrolling in forming a unique GNS. At high-temperature perturbations, the edge folding
and scrolling transitions to GNFs and GNSs occurred within the ultrafast period. Remarkably, the
ESG(2$\pi$,3$\pi$) evolved to a dual state that combines folded and scrolled structures in a temperature-independent
process.

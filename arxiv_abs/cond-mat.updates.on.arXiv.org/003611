Detection of material inhomogeneities is an important task in magnetic imaging and plays a significant
role in understanding physical processes. For example, in spintronics, the sample heterogeneity
determines the onset of current-driven magnetization motion. While often a significant effort
is made in enhancing the resolution of an experimental technique to obtain a deeper insight into
the physical properties, here we want to emphasize that an advantageous data analysis has the potential
to provide a lot more insight into given data set, in particular when being close to the resolution
limit where the noise becomes at least of the same order as the signal. In this work, we introduce two
tools - the average latent dimension and average latent entropy - which allow for the detection of
very subtle material inhomogeneity patterns in the data. For example, for the Ising model, we show
that these tools are able to resolve exchange differences down to $1\%$. For a micromagnetic model,
we demonstrate that the latent entropy can be used to detect changes in the easy axis anisotropy from
magnetization data. We show that the latent entropy remains robust when imposing noise on the data,
changing less than $0.3\%$ after adding Gaussian noise of the same amplitude as the signal. Furthermore,
we demonstrate that these data-driven tools can be used to visualize inhomogeneities based on MOKE
data of magnetic whirls and thereby can help to explicitly resolve impurities and pinning centers.
To evaluate the performance of the average latent dimension and entropy, we show that they outperform
common instruments ranging from standard statistics measures to state-of-the-art data analysis
techniques such as Gaussian mixture models not only in recognition quality but also in the required
computational cost.

The bond fluctuation method is used to simulate both non-concatenated entangled and interpenetrating
melts of ring polymers. We find that the swelling of interpenetrating rings upon dilution follows
the same laws as for linear chains. Knotting and linking probabilities of ring polymers in semi-dilute
solution are analyzed using the HOMFLY polynomial. We find an exponential decay of the knotting
probability of rings. The correlation length of the semi-dilute solution can be used to superimpose
knotting data at different concentrations. A power law dependence $f_{n}\sim\phi R^{2}\sim\phi^{0.77}N$
for the average number $f_{n}$ of linked rings per ring at concentrations larger than the overlap
volume fraction of rings $\phi^{*}$ is determined from the simulation data. The fraction of non-concatenated
rings displays an exponential decay $P_{OO}\sim\exp(-f_{n})$, which indicates $f_{n}$ to provide
the entropic effort for not forming concatenated conformations. Based upon this results we find
four different regimes for the conformations of rings in melts that are separated by a critical lengths
$N_{OO}$, $N_{C}$ and $N^{*}$. $N_{OO}$ describes the onset of the effect of non-concatenation
below which topological effects are not important, $N_{C}$ is the cross-over between weak and strong
compression of rings, and $N^{*}$ is defined by the cross-over from a non-concatenation contribution
$f_{n}\sim\phi R^{2}$ to an overlap dominated concatenation contribution $f_{n}\sim\phi N^{1/2}$
at $N>N^{*}$. For $N_{OO}<N<N_{C}$, the scaling of ring sizes $R\sim N^{2/5}$ results from balancing
non-concatenation with weak compression of rings. For $N_{C}<N<N^{*}$, non-concatenation and
strong compression imply $R\sim N^{3/8}$. Our simulation data for non-interpenetrating rings
up to $N=1024$ are in good agreement with the prediction for weakly compressed rings.

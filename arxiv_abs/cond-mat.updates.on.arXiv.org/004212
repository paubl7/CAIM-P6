We theoretically investigate multiple-$Q$ spin textures, which are composed of superpositions
of spin density waves with different wave numbers, for an effective spin model of centrosymmetric
itinerant magnets. Our focus is on the interplay between biquadratic interactions arising from
the spin-charge coupling and magnetic anisotropy caused by the spin-orbit coupling. Taking into
account two types of the magnetic anisotropy, single-ion anisotropy and bond-dependent anisotropy,
we elucidate magnetic phase diagrams for an archetypal triangular-lattice system in the absence
and presence of an external magnetic field. In the case of the single-ion anisotropy, we find a plethora
of multiple-$Q$ instabilities depending on the strength and the sign of the anisotropy (easy plane
or easy axis), including a skyrmion crystal with topological number of two. In an external magnetic
field, we find that a skyrmion crystal with topological number of one is stabilized by the in-plane
(out-of-plane) magnetic field under the easy-plane (easy-axis) anisotropy. We also examine the
stability of the field-induced skyrmion crystal by rotating the field direction. As a biproduct,
we show that a triple-$Q$ state with nonzero chirality appears in the presence of the biquadratic
interaction and the easy-axis anisotropy. Meanwhile, we find that the bond-dependent anisotropy
also stabilizes both types of skyrmion crystals. We show that, however, for the skyrmion crystal
with topological number of one, Bloch- and N\'eel-type skyrmion crystals are selectively realized
depending on the sign of the bond-dependent anisotropy. Moreover, we find yet another multiple-$Q$
states, including two types of meron crystals with the skyrmion numbers of one and two. The systematic
investigation will provide a reference to complex magnetic textures in centrosymmetric magnetic
metals.

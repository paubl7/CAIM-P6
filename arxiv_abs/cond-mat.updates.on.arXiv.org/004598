Scalar Field Dark Matter (SFDM), comprised of ultralight ($\gtrsim 10^{-22}$ eV) bosons, is distinguished
from massive ($\gtrsim$ GeV), collisionless Cold Dark Matter (CDM) by its novel structure-formation
dynamics as Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) and quantum superfluid with wave-like properties,
described by the Gross-Pitaevski and Poisson (GPP) equations. In the free-field (fuzzy) limit
of SFDM (FDM), structure is inhibited below the de Broglie wavelength $\lambda_{\text{deB}}$,
but resembles CDM on larger scales. Virialized haloes have solitonic cores of radius $\sim \lambda_{\text{deB}}$
that follow the ground-state attractor solution of GPP, surrounded by CDM-like envelopes. As superfluid,
SFDM is irrotational (vorticity-free) but can be unstable to vortex formation. We previously showed
this can happen in halo cores, from angular momentum arising during structure formation, when repulsive
self-interaction (SI) is present to support them out to a second length scale $\lambda_{\text{SI}}$
with $\lambda_{\text{SI}} > \lambda_{\text{deB}}$ (the Thomas-Fermi regime), but only if SI
is strong enough. This suggested FDM cores (without SI) would not form vortices. FDM simulations
later found vortices, but only outside halo cores, consistent with our previous suggestion based
upon TF-regime analysis. We extend that analysis now to FDM, to show explicitly that vortices should
not arise in solitonic cores from angular momentum, modelling them as either Gaussian spheres or
compressible, ($n = 2$)-polytropic, irrotational Riemann-S ellipsoids. We find that, for typical
halo spin parameters, angular momentum per particle is below $\hbar$, the minimum required even
for one singly-quantized vortex in the centre. Even for larger angular momentum, however, vortex
formation is not energetically favoured.

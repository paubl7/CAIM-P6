Ferroelectric materials contain a switchable spontaneous polarization that persists even in
the absence of an external electric field. The coexistence of ferroelectricity and metallicity
in a material appears to be illusive, since polarization is ill-defined in metals, where the itinerant
electrons are expected to screen the long-range dipole interactions necessary for dipole ordering.
The surprising discovery of the polar metal, LiOsO3 has generated interest in searching for new
polar metals motivated by the prospects of exotic quantum phenomena such as unconventional pairing
mechanisms giving rise to superconductivity, topological spin currents, anisotropic upper critical
fields, and Mott multiferroics. Previous studies have suggested that the coordination preferences
of the Li atom play a key role in stabilizing the polar metal phase of LiOsO3, but a thorough understanding
of how polar order and metallicity can coexist remains elusive. Here, we use XUV-SHG as novel technique
to directly probe the broken inversion-symmetry around the Li atom. Our results agree with previous
theories that the primary structural distortion that gives rise to the polar metal phase in LiOsO3
is a consequence of a sub-Angstrom Li atom displacement along the polar axis. A remarkable agreement
between our experimental results and ab initio calculations provide physical insights for connecting
the nonlinear response to unit-cell spatial asymmetries. It is shown that XUV-SHG can selectively
probe inversion-breaking symmetry in a bulk material with elemental specificity. Compared to
optical SHG methods, XUV-SHG fills a key gap for studying structural asymmetries when the structural
distortion is energetically separated from the Fermi surface. Further, these results pave the
way for time-resolved probing of symmetry-breaking structural phase transitions on femtosecond
timescales with element specificity.

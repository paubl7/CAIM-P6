Exchange coupling between localized spins and band or topological states accounts for giant magnetotransport
and magnetooptical effects as well as determines spin-spin interactions in magnetic insulators
and semiconductors. However, even in archetypical dilute magnetic semiconductors such as Cd$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Te
and Hg$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Te the evolution of this coupling with the wave vector is not understood. A
series of experiments have demonstrated that exchange-induced splitting of magnetooptical spectra
of Cd$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Te and Zn$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Te at the L points of the Brillouin zone is, in contradiction
to the existing theories, more than one order of magnitude smaller compared to its value at the zone
center and can show an unexpected sign of the effective Land\'e factors. The origin of these findings
we elucidate quantitatively by combining: (i) relativistic first-principles density functional
calculations; (ii) a tight-binding approach that takes carefully into account k-dependence of
the potential and kinetic sp-d exchange interactions; (iii) a theory of magnetic circular dichroism
(MCD) for $E_1$ and $E_1$ + $\Delta_1$ optical transitions, developed here within the envelope
function $kp$ formalism for the L point of the Brillouin zone in zinc-blende crystals. This combination
of methods leads to the conclusion that the physics of MCD at the boundary of the Brillouin zone is
strongly affected by the strength of two relativistic effects in particular compounds: (i) the
mass-velocity term that controls the distance of the conduction band at the L point to the upper Hubbard
band of Mn ions and, thus, a relative magnitude and sign of the exchange splittings in the conduction
and valence bands; (ii) the spin-momentum locking by spin-orbit coupling that reduces exchange
splitting depending on the orientation of particular L valleys with respect to the magnetization
direction.

Roles of fermion-fermion interactions are carefully studied in governing the low-energy fates
of a two-dimensional spin-$1/2$ fermionic system on the kagom\'{e} lattice, which features a quadratic
band crossing point touched parabolically by up and down energy bands. In the framework of a renormalization
group, we establish the coupled energy-dependent flows of fermionic interaction parameters by
treating all kinds of fermionic interactions on the same footing and unbiasedly taking into account
their one-loop corrections. Through a compressive analysis of these evolutions that carry the
hierarchical information of physics, a number of outlandish behaviors are progressively decoded
and addressed manifestly in the low-energy regime. At first, we find that various sorts of fermion-fermion
interactions furiously compete and affect each other. With the decrease of energy scale, they are
inevitably attracted by certain fixed point in the parameter space which clusters into three qualitatively
distinct regions relying heavily upon structure parameters of materials. In addition, the leading
instability accompanied by some symmetry breaking is attentively investigated in the proximity
of different sorts of fixed points. Computing and comparing susceptibilities of twelve potential
candidates indicates that charge density wave always dominates over others. Incidently, there
exists several options for subleading ones including the $x$-current, bond density, and chiral
plus s-wave superconductors. At last, we examine how physical observables behave nearby the dominant
instability. Due to the strong fluctuations neighboring this instability linked to charge density
wave, density of states and specific heat as well compressibility of quasiparticles are significantly
suppressed, signalling the emergence of non-Fermi liquid behaviors.

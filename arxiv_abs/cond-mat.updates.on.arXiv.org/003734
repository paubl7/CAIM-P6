We investigate deep learning autoencoders for the unsupervised recognition of phase transitions
in physical systems formulated on a lattice. We focus our investigation on the 2-dimensional ferromagnetic
Ising model and then test the application of the autoencoder on the anti-ferromagnetic Ising model.
We use spin configurations produced for the 2-dimensional ferromagnetic and anti-ferromagnetic
Ising model in zero external magnetic field. For the ferromagnetic Ising model, we study numerically
the relation between one latent variable extracted from the autoencoder to the critical temperature
$T_c$. The proposed autoencoder reveals the two phases, one for which the spins are ordered and the
other for which spins are disordered, reflecting the restoration of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry
as the temperature increases. We provide a finite volume analysis for a sequence of increasing lattice
sizes. For the largest volume studied, the transition between the two phases occurs very close to
the theoretically extracted critical temperature. We define as a quasi-order parameter the absolute
average latent variable ${\tilde z}$, which enables us to predict the critical temperature. One
can define a latent susceptibility and use it to quantify the value of the critical temperature $T_c(L)$
at different lattice sizes and that these values suffer from only small finite scaling effects.
We demonstrate that $T_c(L)$ extrapolates to the known theoretical value as $L \to \infty$ suggesting
that the autoencoder can also be used to extract the critical temperature of the phase transition
to an adequate precision. Subsequently, we test the application of the autoencoder on the anti-ferromagnetic
Ising model, demonstrating that the proposed network can detect the phase transition successfully
in a similar way.

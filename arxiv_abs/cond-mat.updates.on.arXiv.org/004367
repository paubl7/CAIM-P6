The efficient and accurate calculation of how ionic quantum and thermal fluctuations impact the
free energy of a crystal, its atomic structure, and phonon spectrum is one of the main challenges
of solid state physics, especially when strong anharmonicy invalidates any perturbative approach.
To tackle this problem, we present the implementation on a modular Python code of the stochastic
self-consistent harmonic approximation method. This technique rigorously describes the full
thermodyamics of crystals accounting for nuclear quantum and thermal anharmonic fluctuations.
The approach requires the evaluation of the Born-Oppenheimer energy, as well as its derivatives
with respect to ionic positions (forces) and cell parameters (stress tensor) in supercells, which
can be provided, for instance, by first principles density-functional-theory codes. The method
performs crystal geometry relaxation on the quantum free energy landscape, optimizing the free
energy with respect to all degrees of freedom of the crystal structure. It can be used to determine
the phase diagram of any crystal at finite temperature. It enables the calculation of phase boundaries
for both first-order and second-order phase transitions from the Hessian of the free energy. Finally,
the code can also compute the anharmonic phonon spectra, including the phonon linewidths, as well
as phonon spectral functions. We review the theoretical framework of the stochastic self-consistent
harmonic approximation and its dynamical extension, making particular emphasis on the physical
interpretation of the variables present in the theory that can enlighten the comparison with any
other anharmonic theory. A modular and flexible Python environment is used for the implementation,
which allows for a clean interaction with other packages. We briefly present a toy-model calculation
to illustrate the potential of the code.

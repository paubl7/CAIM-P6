Plastic events in sheared glasses are considered an example of so-called avalanches, whose sizes
obey a power-law probability distribution with the avalanche critical exponent $\tau$. Although
mean-field theory predicts a universal value of this exponent, $\tau_{\rm MF}=1.5$, numerical
simulations have reported different values depending on the literature. Moreover, in the elastic
regime, it has been noted that the critical exponent can be different from that in the steady state,
and even criticality itself is a matter of debate. Because these confusingly varying results were
reported under different setups, our knowledge of avalanche criticality in sheared glasses is
greatly limited. To gain a unified understanding, in this work, we conduct a comprehensive numerical
investigation of avalanches in Lennard-Jones glasses under athermal quasistatic shear. In particular,
by excluding the ambiguity and arbitrariness that has crept into the conventional measurement
schemes, we achieve high-precision measurement and demonstrate that the exponent $\tau$ in the
steady state follows the mean-field prediction of $\tau_{\rm MF}=1.5$. Our results also suggest
that there are two qualitatively different avalanche events. This binariness leads to the non-universal
behavior of the avalanche size distribution and is likely to be the cause of the varying values of
$\tau$ reported thus far. To investigate the dependence of criticality and universality on applied
shear, we further study the statistics of avalanches in the elastic regime and the ensemble of the
first avalanche event in different samples, which provide information about the unperturbed system.
We show that while the unperturbed system is indeed off-critical, criticality gradually develops
as shear is applied. Moreover, the critical exponent obeys the mean-field prediction $\tau_{\rm
MF}$ universally, once the system becomes critical.

Stable colloidal dispersions with evenly distributed particles are important for many technological
applications. Due to Brownian motion colloidal particles have constant collisions with each other
which often lead to their aggregation driven by the long range van der Waals attraction. As a result
the colloidal systems often tend to precipitate. A number of methods have been devised to minimize
the effect of long-range van der Waals attraction between colloidal particles or to override the
influence of the attraction in order to provide the colloidal stability.In the PhD thesis we investigated
the colloidal stabilization in solutions of free polymers which is commonly referred to as depletion
stabilization. Previous theoretical studies of free-polymer induced (FPI) stabilization were
based on oversimplified models involving uncontrolled approximations. Even the most basic features
of the depletion stabilization phenomenon were unknown. It was unclear how the PI repulsion depends
on the solution parameters, polymer structure and monomer/surface interactions.The free polymer
chains were modeled as random walks in a self-consistent molecular field that satisfied to diffusion-like
integro-differential equation. As the molecular field we used the chemical potential that for
semi-dilute polymer solution can be represented as a virial expansion where we took into account
only second and third virial coefficients of the polymer solution. Varying the parameters like
polymer stiffness, polymer length, polymer concentration and solvent regime (like theta solvent)
whether it is for purely repulsive colloidal surface, adsorbed surface or surface with grafted
polymer layer we were able to enhance the repulsive barrier due to the free polymers between the particles
and therefore found conditions for kinetic stabilization of the system.

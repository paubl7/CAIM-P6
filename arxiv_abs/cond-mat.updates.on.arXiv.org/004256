Unconventional superconductivity and magnetism are intertwined on a microscopic level in a wide
class of materials, including high-$T_c$ cuprates, iron pnictides, and heavy-fermion compounds.
A new approach to this most fundamental and hotly debated subject focuses on the role of interactions
between superconducting electrons and bosonic fluctuations at the interface between adjacent
layers in heterostructures. A recent state-of-the-art molecular-beam-epitaxy technique has
enabled us to fabricate superlattices consisting of different heavy-fermion compounds with atomic
thickness. These Kondo superlattices provide a unique opportunity to study the mutual interaction
between unconventional superconductivity and magnetic order through the atomic interface. Here,
we design and fabricate hybrid Kondo superlattices consisting of alternating layers of superconducting
CeCoIn$_5$ with $d$-wave pairing symmetry and nonmagnetic metal YbCoIn$_5$ or antiferromagnetic
heavy fermion metals, such as CeRhIn$_5$ and CeIn$_3$. In these Kondo superlattices, superconducting
heavy electrons are confined within the two-dimensional CeCoIn$_5$ block layers and interact
with the neighboring nonmagnetic or magnetic layers through the interface. In CeCoIn$_5$/YbCoIn$_5$
superlattices, the superconductivity is strongly influenced by the local inversion symmetry
breaking at the interface. In CeCoIn$_5$/CeRhIn$_5$ and CeCoIn$_5$/CeIn$_3$ superlattices,
the superconducting and antiferromagnetic states coexist in spatially separated layers, but
their mutual coupling via the interface significantly modifies the superconducting and magnetic
properties. The fabrication of a wide variety of hybrid superlattices paves a new way to study the
relationship between unconventional superconductivity and magnetism in strongly correlated
materials.

The origin of stretched exponential relaxation in supercooled glass-forming liquids is one of
the central questions regarding the anomalous dynamics of these fluids. The dominant explanation
for this phenomenon has long been the proposition that spatial averaging over a heterogeneous distribution
of locally exponential relaxation processes leads to stretching. Here we perform simulations
of model polymeric and small-molecule glass-formers in the isoconfigurational ensemble to show
that stretching instead emerges from a combination of spatial averaging and locally nonexponential
relaxation. Results indicate that localities in the fluid exhibiting faster-than-average relaxation
tend to exhibit locally stretched relaxation, whereas slower-than-average relaxing domains
exhibit compressed exponential relaxation. We show that local stretching is predicted by loose
local caging, as measured by the Debye-Waller factor, and vice versa. This phenomenology in the
local relaxation of in-equilibrium glasses parallels the dynamics of out of equilibrium under-dense
and over-dense glasses, which likewise exhibit an asymmetry in their degree of stretching vs compression.
On the basis of these results, we hypothesize that local stretching and compression in equilibrium
glass-forming liquids results from evolution of particle mobilities over a single local relaxation
time, with slower particles tending towards acceleration and vice versa. In addition to providing
new insight into the origins of stretched relaxation, these results have implications for the interpretation
of stretching exponents as measured via metrologies such as dielectric spectroscopy: measured
stretching exponents cannot universally be interpreted as a direct measure of the breadth of an
underlying distribution of relaxation times.

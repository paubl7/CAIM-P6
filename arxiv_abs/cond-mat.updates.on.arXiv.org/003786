In many studies, atoms deal with positive or negative charges by losing or gaining their electrons.
However, atoms can execute interstate electron dynamics when in the suitable state. Atoms can also
undertake infinitesimal displacements of the electrons. Such possibilities in atoms show that
they cannot ionize. But the inert gas atoms can split into the electron streams. A generated field
of the propagating photons can distort flowing inert gas atoms. When atoms of inert behavior split
by the current of photons, the characteristics of propagating photons become obvious. In propagating
photons, the element of heat energy dissipates in the air medium while the element of force permeates,
so the glow of light appears, which is also known in plasma. Upon splitting inert gas atoms, electrons
carry forcing energy of the chasing photons to travel. So, when travelling electrons impinge on
underneath solid atoms, atoms deal with different modifications. Gaseous atoms introduce squeezing
behaviors but under the contraction of energy knots clamped electrons. Such atomic behaviors also
indicate that atoms do not ionize. But, the splitting of inert gas atoms into electrons, the carrying
of photons by electrons and the becoming obvious of characteristics of travelling photons infer
that electric current is in fact a photonic current. In microscopic analysis, a magnification of
image is based on the resolving power of photons. A photonic current is due to the photonic propagation,
where photons of suitable force and energy propagate in the interstate electron gap or in the photonic
band gap. Some important principles are discussed here, which also infer the photonic current.
So, the study brings vast changes in the existing state of science and technology.

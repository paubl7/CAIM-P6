The Jahn-Teller theorem constitutes one of the most popular and stringent concepts, applicable
to all fields of chemistry. In open shell transition elements chemistry and physics, 3d4, 3d9, and
3d7(low-spin) configurations in octahedral complexes serve as particular illustrative and firm
examples, where a striking change (distortion) in local geometry is associated to a substantial
reduction of electronic energy. However, there has been a lasting debate, about the fact that the
octahedra are found to exclusively elongate, (at least for eg electrons). Against this background,
the title compound displays two marked features, (1) the octahedron of oxygen atoms around Os6+
(d2) is drastically compressed, in contrast to the standard JT expectations, and (2) the splitting
of the t2g set induced by this compression is extreme, such that a diamagnetic ground state results.
What we see is obviously a Jahn-Teller distortion resulting in a compression of the respective octahedron
and acting on the t2g set of orbitals. Both these issues are unprecedented. Noteworthy, the splitting
into a lower dxy (hosting two d electrons with opposite spin) and two higher dxz and dyz orbitals is
so large that for the first time ever the Hund's coupling for t2g electrons is overcome. We show that
these effects are not forced by structural frustration, the structure offers sufficient space
for Os to shift the apical oxygen atoms to a standard distance. Local electronic effects appear to
be responsible, instead. The relevance of these findings is far reaching, since they provide insights
in the hierarchy of perturbations defining ground states of open shell electronic systems. The
system studied here, offers substantially more structural and compositional degrees of freedom,
such that a configuration could form that enables Os6+ to adopt its apparently genuine diamagnetic
ground state.

Moir\'e superlattices have recently emerged as a novel platform where correlated physics and superconductivity
can be studied with unprecedented tunability. Although correlated effects have been observed
in several other moir\'e systems, magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) remains the only
one where robust superconductivity has been reproducibly measured. Here we realize a new moir\'e
superconductor, mirror symmetric magic-angle twisted trilayer graphene (MATTG) with dramatically
richer tunability in electronic structure and superconducting properties. Hall effect and quantum
oscillations measurements as a function of density and electric field allow us to determine the
system's tunable phase boundaries in the normal state. Zero magnetic field resistivity measurements
then reveal that the existence of superconductivity is intimately connected to the broken symmetry
phase emerging from two carriers per moir\'e unit cell. Strikingly, we find that the superconducting
phase gets suppressed and bounded at the van Hove singularities (vHs) partially surrounding the
broken-symmetry phase, which is difficult to reconcile with weak-coupling BCS theory. Moreover,
the extensive in situ tunability of our system allows us to achieve the ultra-strong coupling regime,
characterized by a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length reaching the average inter-particle distance
and very large $T_\mathrm{BKT}/T_{F}$ ratios in excess of 0.1, where $T_\mathrm{BKT}$ and $T_F$
are the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition and Fermi temperatures, respectively.
These observations suggest that MATTG can be electrically tuned close to the two-dimensional BCS-BEC
crossover. Our results establish a new generation of tunable moir\'e superconductors with the
potential to revolutionize our fundamental understanding and the applications of strong coupling
superconductivity.

The anomalous quantum Hall conductivity in the 2+1D topological insulators in the absence of interactions
may be expressed as the topological invariant composed of the two - point Green function. For the
noninteracting system this expression is the alternative way to represent the TKNN invariant.
It is widely believed that in the presence of interactions the Hall conductivity is given by the same
expression, in which the noninteracting two - point Green function is substituted by the complete
two - point Green function with the interactions taken into account. However, the proof of this statement
has not been given so far. In the present paper we give such a proof in the framework of the particular
tight - binding models of the $2+1$ D topological insulator. Besides, we extend our consideration
to the $3+1$ D Weyl semimetals. It was known previously that with the interactions neglected the
Hall conductivity in those systems is expressed through the two - point Green function in the way
similar to that of the $2+1$ D topological insulators. Again, the influence of interactions on this
expression has not been investigated previously. We consider this problem within the framework
of the particular $3+1$D model of Weyl semimetal in the presence of the contact four - fermion interactions
and Coulomb interactions. We prove (up to the one - loop approximation), that the Hall conductivity
is given by the same expression as in the noninteracting case, in which the noninteracting Green
function is substituted by the complete two - point Green function with the interactions included.
Basing on the obtained expressions we discuss the topological phase transitions accompanied by
the change of Hall conductivity.

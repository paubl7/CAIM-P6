Self-organized spatial patterns of vegetation are frequent in water-limited regions and have
been suggested as important indicators of ecosystem health. However, the mechanisms underlying
their emergence remain unclear. Some theories hypothesize that patterns could result from a scale-dependent
feedback (SDF), whereby interactions favoring plant growth dominate at short distances and growth-inhibitory
interactions dominate in the long range. However, we know little about how net plant-to-plant interactions
may change sign with inter-individual distance, and in the absence of strong empirical support,
the relevance of this SDF for vegetation pattern formation remains disputed. These theories predict
a sequential change in pattern shape from gapped to labyrinthine to spotted spatial patterns as
precipitation declines. Nonetheless, alternative theories show that the same sequence of patterns
could emerge even if net interactions between plants were always inhibitory (purely competitive
feedbacks, PCF). Although these alternative hypotheses lead to visually indistinguishable patterns
they predict very different desertification dynamics following the spotted pattern. Moreover,
vegetation interaction with other ecosystem components can introduce additional spatio-temporal
scales that reshape both the patterns and the desertification dynamics. Therefore, to make reliable
ecological predictions for a focal ecosystem, it is crucial that models accurately capture the
mechanisms at play in the system of interest. Here, we review existing theories for vegetation self-organization
and their conflicting predictions about desertification dynamics. We further discuss possible
ways for reconciling these predictions and potential empirical tests via manipulative experiments
to improve our understanding of how vegetation self-organizes and better predict the fate of the
ecosystems where they form.

The lattice Boltzmann method (LBM) is a numerical approach to tackle problems described by a Boltzmann
type-equation, where time, space, and velocities are discretized to describe scattering and advection.
Even though the LBM executes advection along a lattice direction without numerical error, its usage
in the high Knudsen number regime (ballistic) has been hindered by the ray effect problem (for dimensions
greater than 1D). This problem has its origin in the low number of available propagation directions
on standard LBM lattices. Here, to overcome this limitation, we propose the worm-lattice Boltzmann
method (worm-LBM), which allows a high number of lattice directions by alternating in time the basic
directions described within the next neighbor schemes. Additionally, to overcome the velocity
anisotropy issue, which otherwise clearly manifests itself in the ballistic regime (e.g. the $\sqrt
2$ higher grid velocity of the D2Q8 scheme along the diagonal direction compared to the axial one),
the time-adaptive scheme (TAS) is proposed. The TAS method makes use of pausing advection on the
grid, allowing to impose not only isotropic propagation but also arbitrary direction-dependent
grid velocity. Last but not least, we propose a grid-mean free path (grid-MFP) correction to correctly
handle the aforementioned velocity issue in the diffusive limit, without affecting the ballistic
one. We provide a detailed description of the TAS method and the worm-LBM algorithm, and verify their
numerical accuracy by using several transient diffusive-ballistic phonon transport cases, including
different initial and boundary conditions. Overall, the new, very accurate, and efficient worm-LBM
algorithm, free of numerical smearing and false scattering, has the potential to be at the forefront
of the numerical solvers to tackle the advective part of different equations in a wide field of applications.

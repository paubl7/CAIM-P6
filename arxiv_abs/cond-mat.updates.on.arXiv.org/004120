We study the random geometry of maximum matchings of diluted bipartite lattices such as the diluted
square, honeycomb and cubic lattices in two and three dimensions. Our study brings into play a graph-theoretical
tool, the {\em Dulmage-Mendelsohn decomposition} of a bipartite graph. Using this, we define two
broad classes of non-overlapping connected clusters, ${\mathcal R}$-type and ${\mathcal P}$-type
regions, that together cover the diluted lattice. We demonstrate that the size of these regions
controls monomer and dimer correlations in the statistical mechanics of the corresponding maximally-packed
dimer models. Additionally, we argue that ${\mathcal R}$-type regions host topologically-protected
zero modes in the quantum mechanics of a particle hopping on such random lattices. These ${\mathcal
R}$-type regions also host emergent Majorana fermion excitations of the corresponding bipartite
Majorana networks. In two dimensions, we show that the random geometry of ${\mathcal R}$-type regions
exhibits universal scaling behaviour controlled by a diverging localization length in the limit
of vanishing dilution $n_{\rm vac} \to 0$. In three dimensions, we demonstrate that these ${\mathcal
R}$-type regions display critical scaling behaviour in the vicinity of a "Dulmage-Mendelsohn
percolation" transition at a nonzero dilution threshold $n_{\rm vac}^{\rm crit}$ that lies well
within the geometrically percolated phase of the diluted cubic lattice. We provide an accurate
numerical estimate of $n_{\rm vac}^{\rm crit} $ for the cubic lattice, as well as estimates for the
critical exponents and scaling functions that characterise this new universality class of geometric
criticality in two and three dimensions.

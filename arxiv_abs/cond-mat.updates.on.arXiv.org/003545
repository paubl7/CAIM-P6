Volumetric crystal structure indexing and orientation mapping are key data processing steps for
virtually any quantitative study of spatial correlations between the local chemistry and the microstructure
of a material. For electron and X-ray diffraction methods it is possible to develop indexing tools
which compare measured and analytically computed patterns to decode the structure and relative
orientation within local regions of interest. Consequently, a number of numerically efficient
and automated software tools exist to solve the above characterisation tasks. For atom probe tomography
(APT) experiments, however, the strategy of making comparisons between measured and analytically
computed patterns is less robust because many APT datasets may contain substantial noise. Given
that general enough predictive models for such noise remain elusive, crystallography tools for
APT face several limitations: Their robustness to noise, and therefore, their capability to identify
and distinguish different crystal structures and orientation is limited. In addition, the tools
are sequential and demand substantial manual interaction. In combination, this makes robust uncertainty
quantifying with automated high-throughput studies of the latent crystallographic information
a difficult task with APT data. To improve the situation, we review the existent methods and discuss
how they link to those in the diffraction communities. With this we modify some of the APT methods
to yield more robust descriptors of the atomic arrangement. We report how this enables the development
of an open-source software tool for strong-scaling and automated identifying of crystal structure
and mapping crystal orientation in nanocrystalline APT datasets with multiple phases.

The crystal structure of MoS$_2$ with strong covalent bonds in plane and weak Van der Waals interactions
out of plane gives rise to interesting properties for applications such as solid lubrication, optoelectronics,
and catalysis, which can be enhanced by transition-metal doping. However, the mechanisms for improvement
and even the structure of the doped material can be unclear, which we address with theoretical calculations.
Building on our previous work on Ni-doping of the bulk 2H phase, now we compare to polytypes (1H monolayer
and 3R bulk), to determine favorable sites for Ni and the doping effect on structure, electronic
properties, and the layer dissociation energy. The most favorable intercalation/adatom sites
are tetrahedral intercalation for 3R (like 2H) and Mo-atop for 1H. The relative energies indicate
a possibility of phase change from 2H to 3R with substitution of Mo or S. We find structural and electronic
properties that can be used to identify the doping sites, including metallic behavior in Mo-substituted
3R and 2H, and in-gap states for Mo- and S-substituted 1H, which could have interesting optoelectronic
applications. We observe a large enhancement in the interlayer interactions of Ni-doped MoS$_2$,
opposite to the effect of other transition metals. For lubrication applications, this increased
layer dissociation energy could be the mechanism of low wear. Our systematic study shows the effect
of doping concentration and we extrapolate to the low-doping limit. This work gives insight into
the previously unclear structure of Ni-doped MoS$_2$ and how it can be detected experimentally,
the relation of energy and structures of doped monolayers and bulk systems, the electronic properties
under doping, and the effect of doping on interlayer interactions.

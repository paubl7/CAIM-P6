Domain walls in magnets, vortex lattices in superconductors, contact lines at depinning, and many
other systems can be modelled as an elastic system subject to quenched disorder. Its field theory
possesses a well-controlled perturbative expansion around its upper critical dimension. Contrary
to standard field theory, the renormalization group flow involves a function, the disorder correlator
$\Delta(w)$, therefore termed the functional renormalization group (FRG). $\Delta(w)$ is a physical
observable, the auto-correlation function of the centre of mass of the elastic manifold. In this
review, we give a pedagogical introduction into its phenomenology and techniques. This allows
us to treat both equilibrium (statics), and depinning (dynamics). Building on these techniques,
avalanche observables are accessible: distributions of size, duration, and velocity, as well
as the spatial and temporal shape. Various equivalences between disordered elastic manifolds,
and sandpile models exist: an elastic string driven at a point and the Oslo model; disordered elastic
manifolds and Manna sandpiles; charge density waves and Abelian sandpiles or loop-erased random
walks. Each of these mappings requires specific techniques, which we develop, including modelling
of discrete stochastic systems via coarse-grained stochastic equations of motion, super-symmetry
techniques, and cellular automata. Stronger than quadratic nearest-neighbor interactions lead
to directed percolation, and non-linear surface growth with additional KPZ terms. On the other
hand, KPZ without disorder can be mapped back to disordered elastic manifolds, either on the directed
polymer for its steady state, or a single particle for its decay. Other topics covered are the relation
between functional RG and replica symmetry breaking, and random field magnets. Emphasis is given
to numerical and experimental tests of the theory.

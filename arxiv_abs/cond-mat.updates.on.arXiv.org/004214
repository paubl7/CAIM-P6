We explore the interplay of electron-electron correlations and surface effects in the prototypical
correlated insulating material, NiO. In particular, we compute the electronic structure, magnetic
properties, and surface energies of the $(001)$ and $(110)$ surfaces of paramagnetic NiO using
a fully charge self-consistent DFT+DMFT method. Our results reveal a complex interplay between
electronic correlations and surface effects in NiO, with the electronic structure of the $(001)$
and $(110)$ NiO surfaces being significantly different from that in bulk NiO. We obtain a sizeable
reduction of the band gap at the surface of NiO, which is most significant for the $(110)$ NiO surface.
This suggests a higher catalytic activity of the $(110)$ NiO surface than that of the $(001)$ NiO
one. Our results reveal a charge-transfer character of the $(001)$ and $(110)$ surfaces of NiO.
Most notably, for the $(110)$ NiO surface we observe a remarkable electronic state characterized
by an alternating charge-transfer and Mott-Hubbard character of the band gap in the surface and
subsurface NiO layers, respectively. This novel form of electronic order stabilized by strong
correlations is not driven by lattice reconstructions but of purely electronic origin. We notice
the importance of orbital-differentiation of the Ni $e_g$ states to characterize the Mott-Hubbard
insulating state of the $(001)$ and $(110)$ NiO surfaces. The unoccupied Ni $e_g$ surface states
are seen to split from the lower edge of the conduction band to form strongly localized states in the
fundamental gap of bulk NiO. Our results for the surface energies of the $(001)$ and $(110)$ NiO surfaces
show that the $(001)$ facet of NiO has significantly lower energy. This implies that the relative
stability of different surfaces, at least from a purely energetic point of view, does not depend
on the presence or absence of magnetic order in NiO.

Generating and detecting radiation in the technologically relevant range of the so-called terahertz
gap ($0.1 - 10$ THz) is challenging because of a lack of efficient sources and detectors. Quantum
dots in carbon nanotubes have shown great potential to build sensitive terahertz detectors usually
based on photon-assisted tunnelling. A recently reported mechanism combining resonant quantum
dot transitions and tunnelling barriers asymmetries results in a narrow linewidth photocurrent
response with a large signal-to-noise ratio under weak THz radiation. That device was sensitive
to one frequency, corresponding to transitions between equidistant quantized states. In this
work we show, using numerical together with scanning tunnelling spectroscopy studies of a defect-induced
metallic zigzag single-walled carbon nanotube quantum dot that simultaneously breaking various
symmetries in metallic nanotube quantum dots of arbitrary chirality strongly relaxes the selection
rules in the electric dipole approximation, and removes energy degeneracies. This leads to a richer
set of allowed optical transitions spanning frequencies from 1 THz to several tens of THz, for a $\sim$10
nm quantum dot. Based on these findings, we propose a terahertz detector device based on a metallic
single-walled carbon nanotube quantum dot defined by artificial defects. Depending on its length
and contacts transparency, the operating regimes range from a high-resolution gate-tunable terahertz
sensor to a broadband terahertz detector. Our calculations indicate that the device is largely
unaffected by temperatures up to 100 K, making carbon nanotube quantum dots with broken symmetries
a promising platform to design tunable terahertz detectors that could operate at liquid nitrogen
temperatures.

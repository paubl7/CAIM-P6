The tin-selenide and tin-sulfide classes of materials undergo multiple structural transitions
under high pressure leading to periodic lattice distortions, superconductivity, and topologically
non-trivial phases, yet a number of controversies exist regarding the structural transformations
in these systems. We perform first-principles calculations within the framework of density functional
theory and a careful comparison of our results with available experiments on SnSe$_2$ reveals that
the apparent contradictions among high-pressure results can be attributed to differences in experimental
conditions. We further demonstrate that under hydrostatic pressure a $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}
\times 1$ superstructure can be stabilized above 20 GPa in SnS$_2$ via a periodic lattice distortion
as found recently in the case of SnSe$_2$, and that this pressure-induced phase transition is due
to the combined effect of Fermi surface nesting and electron-phonon coupling at a momentum wave
vector $\mathbf{q}$ = $(1/3, 1/3, 0)$. In addition, we investigate the contribution of nonadiabatic
corrections on the calculated phonon frequencies, and show that the quantitative agreement between
theory and experiment for the high-energy $A_{1g}$ phonon mode is improved when these effects are
taken into account. Finally, we examine the nature of the superconducting state recently observed
in SnSe$_2$ under nonhydrostatic pressure and predict the emergence of superconductivity with
a comparable critical temperature in SnS$_2$ under similar experimental conditions. Interestingly,
in the periodic lattice distorted phases, the critical temperature is found to be reduced by an order
of magnitude due to the restructuring of the Fermi surface.

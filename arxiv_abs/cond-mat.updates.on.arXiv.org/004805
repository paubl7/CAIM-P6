High-Q microwave cavity modes coupled to transmon ancillas provide a hardware-efficient platform
for quantum computing. Due to their coupling, the cavity modes inherit finite nonlinearity from
the transmons. In this work, we theoretically and experimentally investigate how an off-resonant
drive on the transmon ancilla modifies the nonlinearities of cavity modes in qualitatively different
ways, depending on the interrelation among cavity-transmon detuning, drive-transmon detuning
and transmon anharmonicity. For a cavity-transmon detuning that is smaller than or comparable
to the drive-transmon detuning and transmon anharmonicity, the off-resonant transmon drive can
induce multiphoton resonances among cavity and transmon excitations that strongly modify cavity
nonlinearities as drive parameters vary. For a large cavity-transmon detuning, the drive induces
cavity-photon-number-dependent ac Stark shifts of transmon levels that translate into effective
cavity nonlinearities. In the regime of a weak transmon-cavity coupling, the cavity Kerr nonlinearity
relates to the third-order nonlinear susceptibility function $\chi^{(3)}$ of the driven ancilla.
This susceptibility function provides a numerically efficient way of computing the cavity Kerr
particularly for systems with many cavity modes controlled by a single transmon. It also serves
as a diagnostic tool for identifying undesired drive-induced multiphoton resonance processes.
Lastly, we show that by judiciously choosing the drive amplitude, a single off-resonant transmon
drive can be used to cancel the cavity self-Kerr nonlinearity as well as inter-cavity cross-Kerr.
This provides a way of dynamically correcting the cavity Kerr nonlinearity during bosonic operations
or quantum error correction protocols that rely on the cavity modes being linear.

Dynamic and steady state aspects of wave propagation are deeply connected in lossless open systems
in which the scattering matrix is unitary. There is then an equivalence among the energy excited
within the medium, the Wigner time delay, and the density of states. But these equivalences fall
away in the presence of material loss or gain. In this paper, we use microwave measurements, numerical
simulations, and theoretical analysis to discover the changing relationships among the internal
field, transmission, transmission time, dwell time, total excited energy, and the density of states
in with loss and gain, and their dependence upon dimensionality and spectral overlap. The total
energy excited is equal to the dwell time. In 1D, the average transmission time is independent of
loss, gain, and scattering strength. In higher dimensions, however, the average transmission
time falls with loss, scattering strength and channel number, and increases with gain. It is the
sum over Lorentzian functions associated with the zeros as well as the poles of the transmission
matrix. This endows transmission zeros with robust topological characteristics: in unitary media,
zeros occur either singly on the real axis or as conjugate pairs in the complex frequency plane. In
weakly absorbing media, the spectrum of the transmission time of the lowest transmission eigenchannel
is the sum of Lorentzians due to transmission zeros plus a background due to far-off-resonance poles.
The average density of transmission zeros in the complex plane is found from the fall of the average
transmission time with absorption as zeros are swept into the lower half of the complex frequency
plane. We show that the disposition of poles and zeros in the complex frequency plane provides a framework
for understanding and controlling wave propagation in non-Hermitian systems.

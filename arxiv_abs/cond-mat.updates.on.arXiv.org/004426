We derive exact nonlocal expressions for the effective dielectric constant tensor ${\boldsymbol
\varepsilon}_e({\bf k}_I, \omega)$ of disordered two-phase composites and metamaterials from
first principles. This formalism extends the long-wavelength limitations of conventional homogenization
estimates of ${\boldsymbol \varepsilon}_e({\bf k}_I, \omega)$ for arbitrary microstructures
so that it can capture spatial dispersion well beyond the quasistatic regime (where $\omega$ and
${\bf k}_I$ are frequency and wavevector of the incident radiation). This is done by deriving nonlocal
strong-contrast expansions that exactly account for multiple scattering for the range of wavenumbers
for which our extended homogenization theory applies, i.e., $0 \le |{\bf k}_I| \ell \lesssim 1$
(where $\ell$ is a characteristic heterogeneity length scale). Due to the fast-convergence properties
of such expansions, their lower-order truncations yield accurate closed-form approximate formulas
for ${\varepsilon}_e({\bf k}_I,\omega)$ that incorporate microstructural information via
the spectral density, which is easy to compute for any composite. The accuracy of these microstructure-dependent
approximations is validated by comparison to full-waveform simulation methods for both 2D and
3D ordered and disordered models of composite media. Thus, our closed-form formulas enable one
to predict accurately and efficiently the effective wave characteristics well beyond the quasistatic
regime without having to perform full-blown simulations. Among other results, we show that certain
disordered hyperuniform particulate composites exhibit novel wave characteristics. Our results
demonstrate that one can design the effective wave characteristics of a disordered composite by
engineering the microstructure to possess tailored spatial correlations at prescribed length
scales.

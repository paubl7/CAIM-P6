The recent TASK meta-GGA density functional [Phys. Rev. Research, 1, 033082 (2019)] is constructed
with an enhanced nonlocality in the generalized Kohn-Sham scheme, and therefore harbors great
opportunities for band gap prediction. Although this approximation was found to yield excellent
band gaps of bulk solids, this accuracy cannot be straightforwardly transferred to low-dimensional
materials. The reduced screening of these materials results in larger band gaps compared to their
bulk counterparts, as an additional barrier to overcome. In this work, we demonstrate how the alteration
of exact physical constraints in this functional affects the band gaps of monolayers and nanoribbons,
and present accurate band gaps competing with the HSE06 approximation. In order to achieve this
goal, we have modified the TASK functional (a) by changing the tight upper-bound for one or two-electron
systems ($h_X^0$) from 1.174 to 1.29 (b) by changing the limit of interpolation function $f_X (\alpha
\rightarrow \infty$) of the TASK functional that interpolates the exchange enhancement factor
$F_X (s,\alpha)$ from $\alpha=$ 0 to 1. The resulting modified TASK (mTASK) was tested for various
materials from 3D to 2D to 1D (nanoribbons), and was compared with the results of the higher-level
hybrid functional HSE06 or with the G$_0$W$_0$ approximation within many-body perturbation theory.
We find that mTASK greatly improves the band gaps and band structures of 2D and 1D systems, without
significantly affecting the accuracy of the original TASK for the bulk 3D materials, when compared
to the PBE-GGA and SCAN meta-GGA. We further demonstrate the applicability of mTASK by assessing
the band structures of TMD nanoribbons with respect to various bending curvatures.

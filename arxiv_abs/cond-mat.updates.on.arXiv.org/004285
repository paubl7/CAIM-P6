Density functionals with asymptotic corrections to the long-range potential are recognized as
entry-level methods for electronic structure calculations on molecules that can sustain charge
transfer. Even though charge transfer is also extremely common in Materials-Science, the application
of such methods has been rare. We implement CAM-B3LYP within the VASP framework. Results obtained
for 8 representative materials: aluminum, diamond, graphene, silicon, NaCl, MgO, 2D h-BN and 3D
h-BN, indicate that CAM-B3LYP predictions embody mean-absolute deviations (MAD) compared to
HSE06 that are reduced by a factor of 4 for lattice parameters, 4 for quasiparticle band gaps, 3 for
the lowest optical excitation energies, and 6 for exciton binding energies; the only property for
which HSE06 performed better was the band-gap of silicon. CAM-B3LYP also appears to provide similar
or improved accuracy compared to ab initio G0W0 and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) approaches.
The CAM-B3LYP implementation in VASP was verified by comparison of optimized geometries and reaction
energies for isolated molecules taken from the ACCDB database, evaluated in large periodic unit
cells, to analogous results obtained using Gaussian-basis sets by Gaussian-16. Using standard
GW pseudopotentials and energy cutoffs for the plane-wave calculations and the aug-cc-pV5Z basis
set for the atomic-basis ones, the MAD in energy for 1738 chemical reactions was 0.34 kcal mol-1 (0.015
eV), whilst for 1291 bond lengths this was 0.0036 {\AA}. An approximate scheme for the speedy implementation
of CAM-B3LYP into other electronic-structure codes for materials-science applications was considered
and shown to be less accurate, but nevertheless useful. Analytical functional derivatives for
CAM-B3LYP were also obtained and implemented, ca. halving computational cost compared to use of
standard numerical derivatives.

Discoveries of ordered quantum states of matter are of great fundamental interest, and often lead
to unique applications. The most well known example -- superconductivity -- is caused by the formation
and condensation of pairs of electrons. A key property of superconductors is diamagnetism: magnetic
fields are screened by dissipationless currents. Fundamentally, what distinguishes superconducting
states from normal states is a spontaneously broken symmetry corresponding to long-range coherence
of fermion pairs. Here we report a set of experimental observations in hole doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$
which are not consistent with conventional superconducting behavior. Our specific-heat measurements
indicate the formation of fermionic bound states when the temperature is lowered from the normal
state. However, for $x \sim 0.8$, instead of the standard for superconductors, zero resistance
and diamagnetic screening, for a range of temperatures, we observe the opposite effect: the generation
of self-induced magnetic fields measured by spontaneous Nernst effect and muon spin rotation experiments.
The finite resistance and the lack of any detectable diamagnetic screening in this state exclude
the spontaneously broken symmetry associated with superconducting two-fermion correlations.
Instead, combined evidence from transport and thermodynamic measurements indicates that the
formation of fermionic bound states leads to spontaneous breaking of time-reversal symmetry above
the superconducting transition temperature. These results demonstrate the existence of a broken-time-reversal-symmetry
bosonic metal state. In the framework of a multiband theory, such a state is characterized by quartic
correlations: the long-range order exists only for {\it pairs} of fermion pairs.

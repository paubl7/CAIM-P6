Reversible logic gates were previously implemented in superconducting circuits as adiabatic-reversible
gates, which are powered with a sufficiently slow clock. In contrast, we are studying ballistic-reversible
gates, where fluxons serve to both encode the information and power the gates. No power is applied
to the gate apart from the energy of the input fluxons, and the two possible flux polarities represent
the bit states. Undamped long Josephson junctions (LJJs), where fluxons move at practically constant
speed from inertia, form the input and output channels of the gates. LJJs are connected in the gates
by circuit interfaces, which are designed to allow the ballistic scattering from input to output
fluxon states, using the temporary excitation of a localized mode. The duration of the resonant
scattering determines the operation time of the gate, approximately a few Josephson plasma periods.
Due to the coherent conversions between fluxon and localized modes the ballistic gates can be very
efficient: in our simulations only a few percent of the fluxon's energy are dissipated in the gate
operation. Ballistic-reversible gates can be combined with other, non-ballistic gate circuits
to extend the range of gate functionalities. Here we describe how the CNOT can be built as a structure
that includes the IDSN (Identity-else-Same-gives-NOT) and Store-and-Launch (SNL) gates. The
IDSN is a 2-bit ballistic gate, which we describe and analyze in terms of equivalent 1-bit circuits.
The SNL is a clocking gate, that allows the storage of a bit and the clocked launch of a fluxon on a bit-state
dependent output path. In the CNOT the SNL gates provide the necessary routing and fluxon synchronization
for the input to the IDSN gate.

Hyperuniform states of matter are characterized by anomalous suppression of long-wavelength
density fluctuations. While most of interesting cases of disordered hyperuniformity are provided
by complex many-body systems like liquids or amorphous solids, classical spin chains with certain
long-range interactions have been shown to demonstrate the same phenomenon. It is well-known that
the transverse field Ising model shows a quantum phase transition (QPT) at zero temperature. Under
the quantum effects of a transverse magnetic field, classical hyperuniform spin chains are expected
to lose their hyperuniformity. High-precision simulations of these cases are complicated because
of the presence of highly nontrivial long-range interactions. We perform extensive analysis of
these systems using density matrix renormalization group to study the possibilities of phase transitions
and the mechanism by which they lose hyperuniformity. We discover first-order QPTs in the hyperuniform
spin chains. An interesting feature of the phase transitions in these disordered hyperuniform
spin chains is that, depending on the parameter values, the presence of transverse magnetic field
may remarkably lead to increase in the order of the ground state as measured by the "$\tau$ order metric,"
even if hyperuniformity is lost. Therefore, it would be possible to design materials to target specific
novel quantum behaviors in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. Our numerical investigations
suggest that these spin chains can show no more than two QPTs. We further analyze the long-range interacting
spin chains via the Jordan-Wigner mapping, showing that under the pairwise interacting approximation
and a mean-field treatment, there can be at most two QPTs. Based on these numerical and theoretical
explorations, we conjecture that these spin chains can show a maximum of two QPTs at zero temperature.

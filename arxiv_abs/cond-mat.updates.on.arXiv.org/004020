High-temperature superconductivity emerges in a host of different quantum materials, often in
a region of the phase diagram where the electronic kinetic energy is comparable in magnitude with
the electron-electron Coulomb repulsion. Describing such an intermediate-coupling regime has
proven challenging, as standard perturbative approaches are inapplicable. Hence, it is of enormous
interest to find models that are amenable to be solved using exact methods. While important advances
have been made in elucidating the properties of one such minimal model -- the Hubbard model -- via
numerical simulations, the infamous fermionic sign-problem significantly limits the accessible
parameter space. Here, we employ Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods to solve a multi-band version
of the Hubbard model that does not suffer from the sign-problem and in which only repulsive interband
interactions are present. In contrast to previous sign-problem-free QMC studies, this model does
not have pre-existing fine-tuned magnetic order, and thus treats superconducting, magnetic,
and charge degrees of freedom on an equal footing. We find that, as the electron-electron repulsion
increases, a dome of antiferromagnetic order emerges in the intermediate-coupling regime, accompanied
by a metal-to-insulator crossover line. Superconductivity is found only near the antiferromagnetic
quantum phase transition located on the metallic side of the magnetic dome. Across the antiferromagnetic
quantum phase transition we find a change in the dynamical character of the magnetic fluctuations,
from slow and overdamped in the metallic side to fast and propagating in the insulating side. Our
findings shed new light on the intertwining between superconductivity, magnetism, and charge
correlations in quantum materials.

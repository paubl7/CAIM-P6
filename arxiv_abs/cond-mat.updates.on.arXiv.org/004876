In strained mechanical resonators, the concurrence of tensile stress and geometric nonlinearity
dramatically reduces dissipation. This phenomenon, dissipation dilution, is employed in mirror
suspensions of gravitational wave interferometers and at the nanoscale, where soft-clamping
and strain engineering have allowed extremely high quality factors. However, these techniques
have so far only been applied in amorphous materials, specifically silicon nitride. Crystalline
materials exhibit significantly lower intrinsic damping at cryogenic temperatures, due to the
absence of two level systems in the bulk, as exploited in Weber bars and silicon optomechanical cavities.
Applying dissipation dilution engineering to strained crystalline materials could therefore
enable extremely low loss nanomechanical resonators, due to the combination of reduced internal
friction, high intrinsic strain, and high yield strength. Pioneering work has not yet fully exploited
this potential. Here, we demonstrate that single crystal strained silicon, a material developed
for high mobility transistors, can be used to realize mechanical resonators with ultralow dissipation.
We observe that high aspect ratio ($>10^5$) strained silicon nanostrings support MHz mechanical
modes with quality factors exceeding $10^{10}$ at 7 K, a tenfold improvement over values reported
in silicon nitride. At 7 K, the thermal noise-limited force sensitivity is approximately $45\ \mathrm{{zN}/{\sqrt{Hz}}}$
- approaching that of carbon nanotubes - and the heating rate is only 60 quanta-per-second. Our nanomechanical
resonators exhibit lower dissipation than the most pristine macroscopic oscillators and their
low mass makes them particularly promising for quantum sensing and transduction.

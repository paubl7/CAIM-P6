A cylindrical rubber fibre subject to twist will also elongate: a manifestation of Poynting's effect
in large strain elasticity. Here, we construct an analogous treatment for an active rubber fibre
actuated via an axisymmetric pattern of spontaneous distortion. We start by constructing an exact
large-deformation solution to the equations of elasticity for such fibre subject to imposed twist
and stretch, which reveals spontaneous warping and twisting of the fibre cross-section absent
in passive rubbers. We then compute the corresponding non-linear elastic energy, which encompasses
the Poynting effect, but is minimized by a finite spontaneous twist and stretch. In the second half
of the paper, we apply these results to understand the twist-contraction actuation of nematic elastomer
fibres fabricated with director-fields that encode helical patterns of contraction on heating.
We first consider patterns making a constant angle with respect to the local cylindrical coordinate
system (conical spiral director curves) and verify the predicted spontaneous twist, contraction
and cross-section deformation via finite elements. Secondly, we consider realistic director
distributions for the experimentally reported fibres fabricated by cross-linking while simultaneously
applying stretch and twist. Counter-intuitively, we find that maximum actuation twist is produced
by applying a finite optimal twist during fabrication. Finally, we illustrate that spontaneously
twisting fibres will coil into spring-like shapes on actuation if the ends are prevented from twisting
relative to each other. Such twist-torsion coupling would allow to make a tendril-like "soft-spring"
actuator with low force and high linear stroke compared to the intrinsic contraction of the elastomer
itself.

We propose a method for computing space-resolved correlation properties of the two-dimensional
Hubbard model within a quantum-classical embedding strategy that uses a Noisy, Intermediate Scale
Quantum (NISQ) computer to solve the embedded model. While previous approaches were limited to
purely local, one-impurity embedded models, requiring at most four qubits and relatively shallow
circuits, we solve a two-impurity model requiring eight qubits with an advanced hybrid scheme on
top of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver algorithm. This iterative scheme, dubbed Natural Orbitalization
(NOization), gradually transforms the single-particle basis to the approximate Natural-Orbital
basis, in which the ground state can be minimally expressed, at the cost of measuring the one-particle
reduced density-matrix of the embedded problem. We show that this transformation tends to make
the variational optimization of existing (but too deep) ansatz circuits faster and more accurate,
and we propose an ansatz, the Multi-Reference Excitation Preserving (MREP) ansatz, that achieves
great expressivity without requiring a prohibitive gate count. The one-impurity version of the
ansatz has only one parameter, making the ground state preparation a trivial step, which supports
the optimal character of our approach. Within a Rotationally Invariant Slave Boson embedding scheme
that requires a minimal number of bath sites and does not require computing the full Green's function,
the NOization combined with the MREP ansatz allow us to compute accurate, space-resolved quasiparticle
weights and static self-energies for the Hubbard model even in the presence of noise levels representative
of current NISQ processors. This paves the way to a controlled solution of the Hubbard model with
larger and larger embedded problems solved by quantum computers.

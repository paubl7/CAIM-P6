We investigate the electronic structure of graphene on a series of 2D hexagonal nitride insulators
hXN, X = B, Al, and Ga, with DFT calculations. A symmetry-based model Hamiltonian is employed to extract
orbital parameters and spin-orbit coupling (SOC) from the low-energy Dirac bands of proximitized
graphene. While commensurate hBN induces a staggered potential of about 10 meV into the Dirac bands,
less lattice-matched hAlN and hGaN disrupt the Dirac point much less, giving a staggered gap below
100 $\mu$eV. Proximitized intrinsic SOC surprisingly does not increase much above the pristine
graphene value of 12 $\mu$eV; it stays in the window of (1-16) $\mu$eV, depending strongly on stacking.
However, Rashba SOC increases sharply when increasing the atomic number of the boron group, with
calculated maximal values of 8, 15, and 65 $\mu$eV for B, Al, and Ga-based nitrides, respectively.
The individual Rashba couplings also depend strongly on stacking, vanishing in symmetrically-sandwiched
structures, and can be tuned by a transverse electric field. The extracted spin-orbit parameters
were used as input for spin transport simulations based on Chebyshev expansion of the time-evolution
of the spin expectation values, yielding interesting predictions for the electron spin relaxation.
Spin lifetime magnitudes and anisotropies depend strongly on the specific (hXN)/graphene/hXN
system, and they can be efficiently tuned by an applied external electric field as well as the carrier
density in the graphene layer. A particularly interesting case for experiments is graphene/hGaN,
in which the giant Rashba coupling is predicted to induce spin lifetimes of 1-10 ns, short enough
to dominate over other mechanisms, and lead to the same spin relaxation anisotropy as observed in
conventional semiconductor heterostructures: 50\%, meaning that out-of-plane spins relax twice
as fast as in-plane spins.

Soft particles such as microgels and core-shell particles can undergo significant and anisotropic
deformations when adsorbed to a liquid interface. This, in turn, leads to a complex phase behavior
upon compression. Here we develop a multiscale framework to rationally link the molecular particle
architecture to the resulting interfacial morphology and, ultimately, to the collective interfacial
phase behavior, enabling us to identify the key single-particle properties underlying two-dimensional
continuous, heterostructural, and isostructural solid-solid transitions. Our approach resolves
existing discrepancies between experiments and simulations and thus provides a unifying framework
to describe phase transitions in interfacial soft-particle systems. We establish proof-of-principle
for our rational approach by synthesizing three different poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) soft-particle
architectures, each of which corresponds to a different targeted phase behavior. In parallel,
we introduce a versatile and highly efficient coarse-grained simulation method that adequately
captures the qualitative key features of each soft-particle system; the novel ingredient in our
simulation model is the use of auxiliary degrees of freedom to explicitly account for the swelling
and collapse of the particles as a function of surface pressure. Notably, these combined efforts
allow us to establish the first experimental demonstration of a heterostructural transition to
a chain phase in a single-component system, as well as the first accurate in silico account of the
two-dimensional isostructural transition. Overall, our multiscale framework provides a bridge
between physicochemical soft-particle characteristics at the molecular- and nanoscale and the
collective self-assembly phenomenology at the macroscale, paving the way towards novel materials
with on-demand interfacial behavior.

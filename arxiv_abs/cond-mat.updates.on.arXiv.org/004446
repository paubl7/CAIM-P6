In the field of atomically thin 2D materials, oxides are relatively unexplored in spite of the large
number of layered oxide structures amenable to exfoliation. There is an increasing interest in
ultra-thin film oxide nanostructures from applied points of view. In this perspective paper, recent
progress in understanding the fundamental properties of 2D oxides is discussed. Two families of
2D oxides are considered: (1) van der Waals bonded layered materials in which the transition metal
is in its highest valence state (represented by V$_2$O$_5$ and MoO$_3$) and (2) layered materials
with ionic bonding between positive alkali cation layers and negatively charged transition metal
oxide layers (LiCoO$_2$). The chemical exfoliation process and its combinaton with mechanical
exfoliation are presented for the latter. Structural phase stability of the resulting nanoflakes,
the role of cation size and the importance of defects in oxides are discussed. Effects of two-dimensionality
on phonons, electronic band structures and electronic screening are placed in the context of what
is known on other 2D materials, such as transition metal dichalcogenides. Electronic structure
is discussed at the level of many-body-perturbation theory using the quasiparticle self-consistent
$GW$ method, the accuracy of which is critically evaluated including effects of electron-hole
interactions on screening and electron-phonon coupling. The predicted occurence of a two-dimensional
electron gas on Li covered surfaces of LiCoO$_2$ and its relation to topological aspects of the band
structure and bonding is presented as an example of the essential role of the surface in ultrathin
materials. Finally, some case studies of the electronic transport and the use of these oxides in
nanoscale field effect transistors are presented.

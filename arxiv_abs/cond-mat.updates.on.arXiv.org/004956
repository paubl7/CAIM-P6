The boundary charge that accumulates at the edge of a one-dimensional single-channel insulator
is known to possess the universal property, that its change under a lattice shift towards the edge
by one site is given by the sum of the average bulk electronic density and a topologically invariant
contribution, restricted to the values $0$ and $-1$ [Phys. Rev. B 101, 165304 (2020)]. This quantized
contribution is associated with particle-hole duality, ensures charge conservation and fixes
the mod(1) ambiguity appearing in the Modern Theory of Polarization. In the present work we generalize
the above-mentioned single-channel results to the multichannel case by employing the technique
of boundary Green's functions. We show that the topological invariant associated with the change
in boundary charge under a lattice shift in multichannel models can be expressed as a winding number
of a certain combination of components of bulk Green's functions as function of the complex frequency,
as it encircles the section of the energy axis that corresponds to the occupied part of the spectrum.
We observe that this winding number is restricted to values ranging from $-N_c$ to $0$, where $N_c$
is the number of channels (orbitals) per site. Furthermore, we consider translationally invariant
one-dimensional multichannel models with an impurity and introduce topological indices which
correspond to the quantized charge that accumulates around said impurity. These invariants are
again given in terms of winding numbers of combinations of components of bulk Green's functions.
Through this construction we provide a rigorous mathematical proof of the so called nearsightedness
principle formulated by W. Kohn [Phys. Rev. Lett. 76, 3168 (1996)] for noninteracting multichannel
lattice models.

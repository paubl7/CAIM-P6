The performance of optical devices manufactured via laser micromachining on nonlinear transparent
materials, relies usually on three main factors which are the characteristic laser parameters
(i.e. the laser power, pulse duration and pulse repetition rate), characteristic properties of
host materials (e.g. their chromatic dispersions, optical nonlinearities or self-focusing features,
etc.) and the relative importance of physical processes such as the avalanche impact ionization,
multiphoton ionization and electron-hole radiative recombination processes. These factors
act in conjunction to impose the regime of laser operation, in particular their competition determines
the appropriate laser operation regime. In this work a theoretical study is proposed to explore
the effects of the competition between multiphoton absorption, plasma ionization and electron-hole
radiative recombination processes, on the laser dynamics in transparent materials with Kerr nonlinearity.
The study rests on a model consisting of a K-order nonlinear complex Ginzburg-Landau equation,
coupled to a first-order equation describing time variation of the electron plasma density. An
analysis of stability of continuous waves, following the modulational-instability approach,
reveals that the combination of multiphoton absorption and electron-hole radiative recombination
processes can be detrimental or favorable to continuous-wave operation, depending on the group-velocity
dispersion of the host medium. Numerical simulations of the model equations in the full nonlinear
regime, reveal the eixstence of pulse trains the amplitudes of which are enhanced by the radiative
recombination processes. Numerical results for the density of the induced electron plasma feature
two distinct regimes of time evolution, depending on the strength of the electron-hole radiative
recombination processes.

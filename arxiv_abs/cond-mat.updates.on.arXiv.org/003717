Diffusion-limited association reactions are ubiquitous in nature. They are particularly important
for biological reactions, where the reaction rates are often determined by the diffusive transport
of the molecules on two-dimensional surfaces, such as the cell membrane. The peculiarities of diffusion
on two-dimensional surfaces may lead to nontrivial reaction kinetics, such as concentration dependent
rate of association between two molecules. However, traditionally, the kinetics of biomolecular
association reactions has been modeled using the law of mass action, which assumes that the rate
of reaction is a concentration independent constant. In this paper, using multiscale molecular
simulation, we investigate the concentration dependence of diffusion-limited association reactions
on 2D surfaces. In particular, we quantify the influence of short-ranged pair interactions on the
concentration dependence of the reaction rates and codify it in an empirical law. Using this law
in a chemical kinetic model, we find that the the steady state behaviors of simple chemical systems
are drastically modified by the presence of concentration dependent rates. In particular, we find
that it leads to suppression of intrinsic noise in dimerization reaction and destabilizes robust
oscillation in Lotka-Volterra predator-prey systems. In fact, we see a transition from robust
to fine-tuned behavior in the latter. In addition, we show that concentration dependent reaction
rates arise naturally in stochastic predator-prey systems due to intrinsic noise. We comment on
the consequences of these results and discuss their implications in the modeling of complex chemical
and biological systems. In particular, we comment on the range of validity of the law of mass action,
which is a staple in all theoretical modeling of these systems.

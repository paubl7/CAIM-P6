$^4$He confined in nanoporous Gelsil glass is a unique, strongly correlated Bose system exhibiting
quantum phase transition (QPT) by controlling pressure. Previous studies revealed that the QPT
occurs with four - dimensional (4D) XY criticality, which appears in the zero-temperature limit
of the superfluid density. However, the $P-T$ phase diagram also suggested that 4D XY nature appears
at finite temperatures. Here, we have determined the critical exponent of the superfluid density
of $^4$He in two Gelsil samples that have pore diameter to be about 3 nm, using a newly developed mechanical
resonator technique. The critical exponent $\zeta$ in the powerlaw fitting $\rho_{\mathrm s}
\propto \left| 1 - T/T_{\mathrm c} \right| ^{\zeta}$, where $T_{\mathrm c}$ is the superfluid transition
temperature, was found to be 1.0 $\pm$ 0.1 for all pressures realized in this experiment, 0.1 $<$
$P$ $<$ 2.4 MPa. This value of $\zeta$ gives a decisive evidence that the finite-temperature superfluid
transition belongs to 4D XY universality class. The emergence of the 4D XY criticality is explained
by the existence of many nanoscale superfluid droplets, the so called localized Bose - Einstein
condensates (LBECs), above $T_{\mathrm c}$. Due to the large energy cost for $^4$He atoms to move
between the LBECs, the phase of the LBEC order parameters fluctuates not only in spatial (3D) but
imaginary time ($+1$D) dimensions, resulting in the 4D XY criticality by a temperature near $T_{\mathrm
c}$, which is determined by the finite size of the system in the imaginary time dimension. Below $T_{\mathrm
c}$, macroscopic superfluidity grows in the nanopores of Gelsil by the alignment of the phases of
the LBEC order parameters. An excess dissipation peak observed below $T_{\mathrm c}$ is well explained
by this phase matching process.

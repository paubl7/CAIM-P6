Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (MX2) are promising candidates for future electronics.
Although the transport properties (e.g. mobility) at low electric field have been widely studied,
there are limited studies on high-field properties, which are important for many applications.
Particularly, there is lack of understanding of the physical origins underlying the property differences
across different MX2. Here by combining first-principles calculations with Monte Carlo simulations,
we study the high-field electron transport in defects-free unstrained and tensilely strained
MX2 (M=Mo, W and X=S, Se). We find that WS2 has the highest peak velocity (due to its smallest effective
mass) that can be reached at the lowest electric field (owing to its highest mobility). Strain can
increase the peak velocity by increasing the scattering energy. After reaching the peak velocity,
most MX2 demonstrates negative differential mobility (NDM). WS2 shows the largest NDM among unstrained
MX2 due to the strongest effect of electron transfer from the low-energy small-mass valley to the
high-energy large-mass valley. The tensile strain increases the valley separation, which on one
hand suppresses the electron transfer in WS2, on the other hand allows the electrons to access the
non-parabolic band region of the low-energy valley. The latter effect leads to an NDM for electrons
in the low-energy valley, which can significantly increase the overall NDM at moderate strain.
The valley-separation induced NDM in the low-energy valley is found to be a general phenomenon.
Our work unveils the physical factors underlying the differences in high-field transport properties
of different MX2, and also identifies the most promising candidate as well as effective approach
for further improvement.

We show that thermodynamic scaling can be derived by combining the Murnaghan equation of state (EOS)
with the generalized entropy theory (GET) of glass formation. In our theory, thermodynamic scaling
arises in the non-Arrhenius relaxation regime as a scaling property of the fluid configurational
entropy density $s_c$, normalized by its value $s_c^*$ at the onset temperature $T_A$ of glass formation,
$s_c / s_c^*$, so that a constant value of $TV^{\gamma}$ corresponds to a \textit{reduced isoentropic}
fluid condition. Molecular dynamics simulations on a coarse-grained polymer melt are utilized
to confirm that the predicted thermodynamic scaling of $\tau_{\alpha}$ by the GET holds both above
and below $T_A$ and to test whether the extent $L$ of stringlike collective motion, normalized its
value $L_A$ at $T_A$, also obeys thermodynamic scaling, as required for consistency with thermodynamic
scaling. While the predicted thermodynamic scaling of both $\tau_{\alpha}$ and $L/ L_A$ is confirmed
by simulation, we find that the isothermal compressibility $\kappa_T$ and the long wavelength
limit $S(0)$ of the static structure factor do not exhibit thermodynamic scaling, an observation
that would appear to eliminate some proposed models of glass formation emphasizing fluid `structure'
over configurational entropy. It is found, however, that by defining a low temperature hyperuniform
reference state, we may define a compressibility relative to this condition, $\delta \kappa_T$,
a transformed dimensionless variable that exhibits thermodynamic scaling and which can be directly
related to $s_c / s_c^*$. Further, the Murnaghan EOS allows us to interpret $\gamma$ as a measure
of intrinsic anharmonicity of intermolecular interactions that may be directly determined from
the pressure derivative of the material bulk modulus.

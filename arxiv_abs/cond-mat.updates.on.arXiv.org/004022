Total hip replacement is the most effective treatment for late stage osteoarthritis. However,
adverse local tissue reactions (ALTRs) associated with fretting corrosion have been observed
in patients with modular total hip implants. The purpose of this study is to increase the fretting
corrosion resistance of the CoCrMo alloy and the associated metal ion release by applying hard coatings
to the surface. Cathodic arc evaporation technique (arc-PVD) was used to deposit TiSiN and ZrN hard
coatings on to CoCrMo substrates. The morphology, chemical composition, crystal structures and
residual stress of the coatings were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, energy dispersive
x-ray spectroscopy, and X-ray diffractometry. Hardness, elastic modulus, and adhesion of the
coatings were measured by nano-indentation, nano-scratch test, and the Rockwell C test. Fretting
corrosion resistance tests of coated and uncoated CoCrMo discs against Ti6Al4V spheres were conducted
on a four-station fretting testing machine in simulated body fluid at 1Hz for 1 million cycles. Post-fretting
samples were analyzed for morphological changes, volume loss and metal ion release. Our analyses
showed better surface finish and lower residual stress for ZrN coating, but higher hardness and
better scratch resistance for TiSiN coating. Fretting results demonstrated substantial improvement
in fretting corrosion resistance of CoCrMo with both coatings. ZrN and TiSiN decreased fretting
volume loss by more than 10 times and 1000 times, respectively. Both coatings showed close to 90%
decrease of Co ion release during fretting corrosion tests. Our results suggest that hard coating
deposition on CoCrMo alloy can significantly improve its fretting corrosion resistance and could
thus potentially alleviate ALTRs in metal hip implants.

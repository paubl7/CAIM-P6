White matter microstructure underpins cognition and function in the human brain through the facilitation
of neuronal communication, and the non-invasive characterization of this structure remains a
research frontier in the neuroscience community. Efforts to assess white matter microstructure,
however, are hampered by the sheer amount of information needed for characterization. Current
techniques within neuroimaging deal with this problem by representing white matter features with
single scalars that are often not easy to interpret. Here, we address these issues by introducing
tools from materials science for the characterization of white matter microstructure. We investigate
structure on a mesoscopic scale by analyzing its homogeneity and determining which regions of the
brain are structurally homogeneous, or "crystalline" in the context of materials science. We find
that crystallinity provides novel information and varies across the brain along interpretable
lines of anatomical difference, with highest homogeneity in regions adjacent to the corpus callosum.
Furthermore, crystallinity is highly reliable, and yet also varies between individuals, making
it a potentially useful biomarker to examine individual differences in white matter along various
dimensions. We also parcellate white matter into "crystal grains," or contiguous sets of voxels
of high structural similarity, and find overlap with other white matter parcellations. Finally,
we characterize the shapes of local white matter signatures through another tool from materials
science - bond-orientational order parameters - and locate fiber crossings and fascicles with
this new technique. Our results provide new means of assessing white matter microstructure on multiple
length scales, and open new avenues of future inquiry. We hope that this work fosters future productive
dialogue between the fields of soft matter and neuroscience.

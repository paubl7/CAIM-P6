A versatile methodology to detect Dirac or Weyl fermions in topological semimetals by transport
or thermodynamic measurements remains an open problem. It is often argued that a $\pi$ phase shift
in quantum oscillations directly corresponds to the Berry phase of topological semimetals. However,
the oscillation phase is complicated by multiple contributing factors including the orbital magnetic
moment, giving rise to non-quantized Berry phases and $\pi$ phase-shifts of non-topological origin.
Here we propose the temperature dependence of the frequency, ${F}(T)$, rather than the oscillation
phase, as a hallmark signature of topology in quantum oscillations. At elevated temperatures where
$2\pi^2 k_BT$ is comparable to the cyclotron energy, $F(T)$ encodes the energy-derivative of the
cyclotron mass -- a quantity that vanishes for conventional Schr\"odinger-type fermions, yet
equals the inverse square of the Fermi velocity for Dirac/Weyl fermions. We experimentally observe
this temperature-dependent frequency in the well-known Dirac semimetal Cd$_3$As$_2$ as well
as the multiband metal LaRhIn$_5$. Despite being vastly different materials, the coefficients
of the $T^2$ term in $F(T)$ both match our theoretical prediction without any fitting parameter,
emphasizing their unified origin. The topologically trivial metal Bi$_2$O$_2$Se acts as a counter-example,
in which no topological frequency shift is observed as expected. Instructively, Bi$_2$O$_2$Se
shows a $\pi$ shift of the quantum-oscillation phase without any topological origin, and hence
gives a false positive under the Landau-fan-plot test. Our method requires no ab-initio calculation
as input, and is able to identify Dirac/Weyl pockets which are small compared to the Brillouin-zone
volume. It should complement or replace the method of phase analysis in experimental discoveries
of topological materials based on quantum oscillations.

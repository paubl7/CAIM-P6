Recently, hollow thermoplastic microspheres, such as Expancel made by Nouryon, have emerged as
an innovative filler material for use in polymer-matrix composites. The resulting all-polymer
syntactic foam takes on excellent damage tolerance properties, strong recoverability under large
strains, and favourable energy dissipation characteristics. Despite finding increasing usage
in various industries and applications, including in coatings, films, sealants, packaging, composites
for microfluidics, medical ultrasonics and cementious composites, there is a near-complete absence
of statistical geometrical information for Expancel microspheres. Further, their mechanical
properties have not yet been reported. In this work we characterise the geometrical quantities
of two classes of Expancel thermoplastic microspheres using X-ray computed tomography, focused
ion beam and electron microscopy. We also observe the spatial distribution of microspheres within
a polyurethane-matrix syntactic foam. We show that the volume-weighted polydisperse shell diameter
in both classes of microsphere follows a normal distribution. Interestingly, polydispersity
of the shell wall thickness is not observed and in particular the shell thickness is not correlated
to the shell diameter. We employ the measured geometrical information in analytical micromechanical
techniques in the small strain regime to determine, for the first time, estimates of the Young's
modulus and Poisson's ratio of the microsphere shell material. Our results contribute to potential
future improvements in the design and fabrication of syntactic foams that employ thermoplastic
microspheres. Given the breadth of fields which utilise thermoplastic microspheres, we anticipate
that our results, together with the methods used, will be of use in a much broader context in future
materials research.

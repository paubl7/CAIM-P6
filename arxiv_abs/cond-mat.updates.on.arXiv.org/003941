Adding thermal conductivity enhancements to increase thermal power in solid-liquid phase-change
thermal energy storage modules compromises volumetric energy density and often times reduces
the mass and volume of active phase change material (PCM) by well over half. In this study, a new concept
of building thermal energy storage modules using high-conductivity, solid-solid, shape memory
alloys is demonstrated to eliminate this trade-off and enable devices that have both high heat transfer
rate and high thermal capacity. Nickel titanium, Ni50.28Ti49.36, was solution heat treated and
characterized using differential scanning calorimetry and Xenon Flash to determine transformation
temperature (78deg-C), latent heat (183 kJm-3), and thermal conductivity in the Austenite and
Martensite phases (12.92/12.64 Wm-1K-1). Four parallel-plate thermal energy storage demonstrators
were designed, fabricated, and tested in a thermofluidic test setup. These included a baseline
sensible heating module (aluminum), a conventional solid-liquid PCM module (aluminum/1-octadecanol),
an all-solid-solid PCM module (Ni50.28Ti49.36), and a composite solid-solid/solid-liquid PCM
module (Ni50.28Ti49.36/1-octadecanol). By using high-conductivity solid-solid PCMs, and eliminating
the need for encapsulants and conductivity enhancements, we are able to demonstrate a 1.73-3.38
times improvement in volumetric thermal capacity and a 2.03-3.21 times improvement in power density
as compared to the conventional approaches. These experimental results are bolstered by analytical
models to explain the observed heat transfer physics and reveal a 5.86 times improvement in thermal
time constant. This work demonstrates the ability to build high-capacity and high-power thermal
energy storage modules using multifunctional shape memory alloys and opens the door for leap ahead
improvement in thermal energy storage performance.

The discoveries of intrinsically magnetic topological materials, including semimetals with
a large anomalous Hall effect and axion insulators, have directed fundamental research in solid-state
materials. Topological quantum chemistry has enabled the understanding of and the search for paramagnetic
topological materials. Using magnetic topological indices obtained from magnetic topological
quantum chemistry (MTQC), here we perform a high-throughput search for magnetic topological materials
based on first-principles calculations. We use as our starting point the Magnetic Materials Database
on the Bilbao Crystallographic Server, which contains more than 549 magnetic compounds with magnetic
structures deduced from neutron-scattering experiments, and identify 130 enforced semimetals
(for which the band crossings are implied by symmetry eigenvalues), and topological insulators.
For each compound, we perform complete electronic structure calculations, which include complete
topological phase diagrams using different values of the Hubbard potential. Using a custom code
to find the magnetic co-representations of all bands in all magnetic space groups, we generate data
to be fed into the algorithm of MTQC to determine the topology of each magnetic material. Several
of these materials display previously unknown topological phases, including symmetry-indicated
magnetic semimetals, three-dimensional anomalous Hall insulators and higher-order magnetic
semimetals. We analyse topological trends in the materials under varying interactions: 60 per
cent of the 130 topological materials have topologies sensitive to interactions, and the others
have stable topologies under varying interactions. We provide a materials database for future
experimental studies and open-source code for diagnosing topologies of magnetic materials.

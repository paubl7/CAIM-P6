In this paper we report the impact of uniaxial strain $\varepsilon$ applied along the crystalline
$a$ axis on the newly discovered kagome superconductor CsV$_3$Sb$_5$. At ambient conditions,
CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ shows a charge-density wave (CDW) transition at $T_{\rm CDW}=94.5$ K and superconducts
below $T_C = 3.34$ K. In our study, when the uniaxial strain $\varepsilon$ is varied from $-0.90\%$
to $0.90\%$, $T_C$ monotonically increases by $\sim 33\%$ from 3.0 K to 4.0 K, giving rise to the empirical
relation $T_C (\varepsilon)=3.4+0.56\varepsilon+0.12\varepsilon^2$. On the other hand, for
$\varepsilon$ changing from $-0.76\%$ to $1.26\%$, $T_{\rm CDW}$ decreases monotonically by
$\sim 10\%$ from 97.5 K to 87.5 K with $T_{\rm CDW}(\varepsilon)=94.5-4.72\varepsilon-0.60\varepsilon^2$.
The opposite response of $T_C$ and $T_{\rm CDW}$ to the uniaxial strain suggests strong competition
between these two orders. Comparison with hydrostatic pressure measurements indicate that it
is the change in the $c$-axis that is responsible for these behaviors of the CDW and superconducting
transitions, and that the explicit breaking of the sixfold rotational symmetry by strain has a negligible
effect. Combined with our first-principles calculations and phenomenological analysis, we conclude
that the enhancement in $T_C$ with decreasing $c$ is caused primarily by the suppression of $T_{\rm
CDW}$, rather than strain-induced modifications in the bare superconducting parameters. We propose
that the sensitivity of $T_{\rm CDW}$ with respect to the changes in the $c$-axis arises from the
impact of the latter on the trilinear coupling between the $M_1^+$ and $L_2^-$ phonon modes associated
with the CDW. Overall, our work reveals that the $c$-axis lattice parameter, which can be controlled
by both pressure and uniaxial strain, is a powerful tuning knob for the phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$.

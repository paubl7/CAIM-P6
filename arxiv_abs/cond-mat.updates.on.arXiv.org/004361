The realization of multifunctional two-dimensional (2D) materials is fundamentally intriguing,
such as combination of piezoelectricity with topological insulating phase or ferromagnetism.
In this work, a Janus monolayer $\mathrm{SrAlGaSe_4}$ is built from 2D $\mathrm{MA_2Z_4}$ family
with dynamic, mechanical and thermal stabilities, which is piezoelectric due to lacking inversion
symmetry. The unstrained $\mathrm{SrAlGaSe_4}$ monolayer is a narrow gap normal insulator (NI)
with spin orbital coupling (SOC). However, the NI to topological insulator (TI) phase transition
can be induced by the biaxial strain, and a piezoelectric quantum spin Hall insulator (PQSHI) can
be achieved. More excitingly, the phase transformation point is only about 1.01 tensile strain,
and nontrivial band topology can hold until considered 1.16 tensile strain. Moreover, a Rashba
spin splitting in the conduction bands can exit in PQSHI due to the absence of a horizontal mirror
symmetry and the presence of SOC. For monolayer $\mathrm{SrAlGaSe_4}$, both in-plane and much
weak out-of-plane piezoelectric polarizations can be induced with a uniaxial strain applied.
The calculated piezoelectric strain coefficients $d_{11}$ and $d_{31}$ of monolayer $\mathrm{SrAlGaSe_4}$
are -1.865 pm/V and -0.068 pm/V at 1.06 tensile strain as a representative TI. In fact, many PQSHIs
can be realized from 2D $\mathrm{MA_2Z_4}$ family. To confirm that, similar to $\mathrm{SrAlGaSe_4}$,
the coexistence of piezoelectricity and topological orders can be realized by strain (about 1.04
tensile strain) in the $\mathrm{CaAlGaSe_4}$ monolayer. Our works suggest that Janus monolayer
$\mathrm{SrAlGaSe_4}$ is a pure 2D system for PQSHI, enabling future studies exploring the interplay
between piezoelectricity and topological orders, which can lead to novel applications in electronics
and spintronics.

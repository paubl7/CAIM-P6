Attention of the mechanics community to shear bands and related localization phenomena. Since
this landmark publication, there has been significant experimental and theoretical investigation
into the onset of shear banding. Yet, given the extremely small length and time scales associated
with band development, several challenges persist in studying the evolution of single bands, post-initiation.
For instance, spatiotemporal development of strain fields in the vicinity of a band, crucial to
understanding the transition from localized flow to fracture, has remained largely unexplored.
Recent full-field displacement measurements, coupled with numerical modeling, have only begun
to ameliorate this problem. This article summarizes our present understanding of plastic flow
dynamics around single shear bands and the subsequent transition to fracture, with special emphasis
on the post-instability stage. These topics are covered specifically from a materials processing
perspective. We begin with a semi-historical look at some of Zener's early ideas on shear bands and
discuss recent advances in experimental methods for mapping localized flow during band formation,
including direct in situ imaging as well as ex situ/post-mortem analyses. Classical theories and
analytical frameworks are revisited in the light of recently published experimental data. We show
that shear bands exhibit a wealth of complex flow characteristics that bear striking resemblance
to viscous fluid flows and related boundary layer phenomena. Finally, new material systems and
strategies for reproducing shear band formation at low speeds are discussed. It is hoped that these
will help further our understanding of shear band dynamics, the subsequent transition to fracture,
and lead to practical `control' strategies for suppressing shear band-driven failures in processing
applications.

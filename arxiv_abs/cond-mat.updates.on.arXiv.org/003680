Comprehensive muon spin rotation/relaxation (muSR) and neutron powder diffraction (NPD) studies
supported via bulk measurements have been performed on the ordered double perovskite Sr2YbRuO6
to investigate the nature of the magnetic ground state. Two sharp transitions at TN1 ~ 42 K and TN2
~ 36 K have been observed in the static and dynamic magnetization measurements, coinciding with
the heat capacity data. In order to confirm the origin of the observed phase transitions and the magnetic
ground state, microscopic evidences are presented here. An initial indication of long-range magnetic
ordering comes from a sharp drop in the muon initial asymmetry and a peak in the relaxation rate near
TN1. NPD confirms that the magnetic ground state of Sr2YbRuO6 consists of an antiferromagnetic
(AFM) structure with interpenetrating lattices of parallel Yb3+ and Ru5+ moments lying in the ab-plane
and adopting a A-type AFM structure. Intriguingly, a small but remarkable change is observed in
the long-range ordering parameters at TN2 confirming the presence of a weak spin reorientation
(i.e. change in spin configuration) transition of Ru and Yb moments, as well as a change in the magnetic
moment evolution of the Yb3+ spins at TN2. The temperature dependent behaviour of the Yb3+ and Ru5+
moments suggests that the 4d-electrons of Ru5+ play a dominating role in stabilizing the long range
ordered magnetic ground state in the double perovskite Sr2YbRuO6 whereas only the Yb3+ moments
show an arrest at TN2. The observed magnetic structure and the presence of a ferromagnetic interaction
between Ru- and Yb- ions are explained with use of the Goodenough-Kanamori-Anderson (GKA) rules.
Possible reasons for the presence of the second magnetic phase transition and of a compensation
point in the magnetization data are linked to competing mechanisms of magnetic anisotropy.

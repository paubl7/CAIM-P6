Scaling of the behavior of a nanodevice means that the device function (selectivity) is a unique
smooth and monotonic function of a scaling parameter that is an appropriate combination of the system's
parameters. For the uniformly charged cylindrical nanopore studied here these parameters are
the electrolyte concentration, $c$, voltage, $U$, the radius and the length of the nanopore, $R$
and $H$, and the surface charge density on the nanopore's surface, $\sigma$. Due to the non-linear
dependence of selectivites on these parameters, scaling can only be applied in certain limits.
We show that the Dukhin number, $\mathrm{Du}=|\sigma|/eRc\sim |\sigma|\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}^{2}/eR$
($\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}$ is the Debye length), is an appropriate scaling parameter in the nanotube
limit ($H\rightarrow\infty$). Decreasing the length of the nanopore, namely, approaching the
nanohole limit ($H\rightarrow 0$), an alternative scaling parameter has been obtained that contains
the pore length and is called the modified Dukhin number: $\mathrm{mDu}\sim \mathrm{Du}\, H/\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}\sim
|\sigma|\lambda_{\mathrm{D}}H/eR$. We found that the reason of non-linearity is that the double
layers accumulating at the pore wall in the radial dimension correlate with the double layers accumulating
at the entrances of the pore near the membrane on the two sides. Our modeling study using the Local
Equilibrium Monte Carlo method and the Poisson-Nernst-Planck theory provides concentration,
flux, and selectivity profiles, that show whether the surface or the volume conduction dominates
in a given region of the nanopore for a given combination of the variables. We propose that the inflection
point of the scaling curve may be used to characterize the transition point between the surface and
volume conductions.

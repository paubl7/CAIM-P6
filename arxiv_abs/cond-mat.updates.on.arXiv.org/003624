The entropy production rate (EPR) offers a quantitative measure of time reversal symmetry breaking
in non-equilibrium systems. It can be defined either at particle level or at the level of coarse-grained
fields such as density; the EPR for the latter quantifies the extent to which these coarse-grained
fields behave irreversibly. In this work, we first develop a general method to compute the EPR of
scalar Langevin field theories with additive noise. This large class of theories includes active
versions of Model A (non-conserved density dynamics) and Model B (conserved) and also models where
both types of dynamics are simultaneously present (such as Model AB). Treating the scalar field
$\phi$ (and its time derivative $\dot\phi$) as the sole observable(s), we arrive at an expression
for the EPR that is non-negative for every field configuration and is quadratic in the time-antisymmetric
component of the dynamics. Our general expression is a function of the quasipotential, which determines
the full probability distribution for configurations, and is not generally calculable. To alleviate
this difficulty, we present a small-noise expansion of the EPR, which only requires knowledge of
the deterministic (mean-field) solution for the scalar field in steady state, which generally
is calculable, at least numerically. We demonstrate this calculation for the case of Model AB. We
then present a similar EPR calculation for Model AB with the conservative and non-conservative
contributions to $\dot\phi = \dot\phi_{\rm A} + \dot\phi_{\rm B}$ viewed as separately observable
quantities. The results are qualitatively different, confirming that the field-level EPR depends
on the choice of coarse-grained information retained within the dynamical description.

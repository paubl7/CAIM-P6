Organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites have recently attracted increasing attention as
highly efficient light harvesting materials for photovoltaic applications. However, the precise
control of crystallization and morphology of organometallic perovskites deposited from solution,
considered crucial for enhancing the final photovoltaic performance, remains challenging. In
this context, here, we report on growing microcrystalline deposits of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3), by
one-step solution casting on cylinde-shaped quartz substrates (rods). We show that the substrate
curvature has a strong influence on morphology of the obtained polycrystalline deposits of MAPbI3.
Although the crystalline width and length markedly decreased for substrates with higher curvatures,
the photoluminescence (PL) spectral peak positions did not significantly evolve for MAPbI3 deposits
on substrates with different diameters. The crystalline size reduction and denser coverage of
microcrystalline MAPbI3 deposits on cylinder-shaped substrates with higher curvatures were
attributed to two major contributions, both related to the annealing step of the MAPbI3 deposits.
In particular, the diameter-dependent variability of the heat capacities and the substrate curvature-enhanced
solvent evaporation rate seemed to contribute the most to the crystallization process and the resulting
morphology changes of MAPbI3 deposits on cylinder-shaped quartz substrates with various diameters.
The longitudinal geometry of cylinder-shaped substrates provided also a facile solution for checking
the PL response of the deposits of MAPbI3 exposed to the flow of various gaseous media, such as oxygen,
nitrogen and argon. Overall, the approach reported herein inspires novel, cylinder-shaped geometries
of MAPbI3 deposits, which can find applications in low-cost photo-optical devices, including
gas sensors.

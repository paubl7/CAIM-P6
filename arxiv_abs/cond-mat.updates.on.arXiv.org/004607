Polymer melts show a characteristic molecular weight dependent relaxation time that can be related
to the unentangled and entangled regime. At high molecular weights, influence of contour length
fluctuations and con-straint release cease and pure reptation prevails. With the broad frequency
range dielectric spectroscopy can fol-low polymer dynamics over a very broad temperature range,
with the additional advantage of recording the spec-tral shape which contains information on reptation.
Here we investigate the apparent discrepancy in the molecular weight for the onset of pure reptation
from the molecular weight dependence and the spectral shape. We examined the popular derivative
method and compared it with a version that includes higher order terms. Higher order terms lead to
a more accurate peak shape and position than those determined with the simpler version. This becomes
important if experimental spectra contain conductivity and polarization contributions. Higher
order terms require the introduction of an interpolating function to analyze experimental spectra,
which lets the Havriliak-Negami function appear to be a more robust, yet reliable tool to determine
the peak shapes. We reach the conclusion that molecular weight dependence and spectral shape can
be both strongly affected by conductivity and polarization contributions. While this leaves uncertainties
on the accurate value of the transition molecular weight, the peak shape points to the existence
of reptation and contour length fluctuations in polyisoprene with a molecular weight greater than
1000 kg/mol, which would imply a ten times greater threshold molecular weight than expected from
previous estimates using the molecular weight dependence.

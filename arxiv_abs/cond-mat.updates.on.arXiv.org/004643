We employ the phenomenological Lawrence-Doniach model to compute the contributions of the superconducting
fluctuations to the third-harmonic magnetic response, denoted here by $\overline{M_{3}}$, which
can be measured in a precise way using ac magnetic fields and lock-in techniques. We show that, in
an intermediate temperature regime, this quantity behaves as the third-order nonlinear susceptibility,
which shows a power-law dependence with the reduced temperature $\epsilon=\frac{T-T_{c}}{T_{c}}$
as $\epsilon^{-5/2}$. Very close to $T_{c}$, however, $\overline{M_{3}}$ saturates due to the
nonzero amplitude of the ac field. We compare our theoretical results with experimental data for
three conventional superconductors -- lead, niobium, and vanadium -- and for the unconventional
superconductor Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ (SRO). We find good agreement between theory and experiment
for the elemental superconductors, although the theoretical values for the critical field systematically
deviate from the experimental ones. In the case of SRO, however, the phenomenological model completely
fails to describe the data, as the third-harmonic response remains sizable over a much wider reduced
temperature range compared to Pb, Nb, and V. We show that an inhomogeneous distribution of $T_{c}$
can partially account for this discrepancy, since regions with a locally higher $T_{c}$ contribute
to the fluctuation $\overline{M_{3}}$ significantly more than regions with the "nominal" $T_{c}$
of the clean system. However, the exponential temperature dependence of $\overline{M_{3}}$ first
reported in Ref. [3] is not captured by the model with inhomogeneity. We conclude that, while inhomogeneity
is an important ingredient to understand the superconducting fluctuations of SRO and other perovskite
superconductors, additional effects may be at play, such as non-Gaussian fluctuations or rare-region
effects.

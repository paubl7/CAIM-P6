We theoretically investigate tunneling through free-space or dielectric nanogaps between metallic
nanocontacts driven by ultrashort ultrabroadband light pulses. For this purpose we develop a time-dependent
quasiclassical theory being especially suitable to describe the tunneling process in the non-adiabatic
regime, when this process can be significantly influenced by the photon absorption as the electron
moves in the classically forbidden region. Firstly, the case of driving by an ideal half-cycle pulse
is studied. For different distances between the contacts, we analyze the main solutions having
the form of a quasiclassical wave packet of the tunneling electron and an evanescent wave of the electron
density. For each of these solutions the resulting tunneling probability is determined with the
exponential accuracy inherent to the method. We identify a crossover between two tunneling regimes
corresponding to both solutions in dependence on the field strength and intercontact distance
that can be observed in the corresponding behaviour of the tunneling probability. Secondly, considering
realistic temporal profiles of few-femtosecond pulses, we demonstrate that the preferred direction
of the electron transport through the nanogap can be controlled by changing the carrier-envelope
phase of the pulse, in agreement with recent experimental findings and numerical simulations.
We find analytical expressions for the tunneling probability, determining the resulting charge
transfer in dependence on the pulse parameters. Further, we determine temporal shifts of the outgoing
electron trajectories with respect to the peaks of the laser field in dependence on the pulse phase
and illustrate when the non-adiabatical character of the tunneling process is particularly important.

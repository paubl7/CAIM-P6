We have designed, optimized, fabricated and characterized highly reflective quasi-omnidirectional
(angular range of $0-60^\circ$) multilayered structures with a wide spectral range. Two techniques,
chirping (a continuous change in thicknesses) and stacking of Bragg-type sub-structures, have
been used to enhance the reflectance with minimum thickness for a given pair of refractive indices.
Numerical calculations were carried out employing the transfer matrix method and we optimized
the design parameters to obtain maximal reflectance averaged over different spectral ranges for
all angles. We fabricated some of the optimized structures with porous silicon dielectric multilayers
with low refractive contrast and compared their measured optical properties with the calculations.
Two chirped structures with thicknesses 21.6 $\mu$m and 60.4 $\mu$m, resulting in quasi omnidirectional
mirrors with bandwidths of 360 nm and 1800 nm, centered at 1160 nm and 1925 nm respectively have been
shown. In addition, we fabricated a stacked sub-Bragg mirror structure with a quasi omnidirectional
bandwidth of 1800 nm (centered at 1850 nm) and a thickness of 41.5 $\mu$m, which is almost two third
(in thickness) of the chirped structure. Thus, our techniques allowed us to obtain relatively thin
quasi-omnidirectional mirrors with wide bands over different wavelength ranges. Our analysis
techniques can be used for the optimization of the reflectance not only in multilayered PS systems
with different refractive index contrasts but also for systems with other types of materials with
low refractive index contrast. The present study could also be useful for obtaining omnidirectional
dielectric mirrors in large spectral regions using different materials, flat focusing reflectors,
thermal regulators, or, if defects are included, as filters or remote chemical/biosensors with
a wide angular independent response.

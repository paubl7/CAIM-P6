Open quantum many body systems describe a number of experimental platforms relevant for quantum
simulations, ranging from arrays of superconducting circuits to ultracold atoms in optical lattices.
Their theoretical understanding is hampered by their large Hilbert space and by their intrinsic
nonequilibrium nature, limiting the applicability of many traditional approaches. In this work
we extend the nonequilibrium bosonic Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) to Markovian open quantum
systems. Within DMFT, a Lindblad master equation describing a lattice of dissipative bosonic particles
is mapped onto an impurity problem describing a single site embedded in its Markovian environment
and coupled to a self-consistent field and to a non-Markovian bath, where the latter accounts for
finite lattice connectivity corrections beyond Gutzwiller mean-field theory. We develop a non-perturbative
approach to solve this bosonic impurity problem, which treats the non-Markovian bath in a non-crossing
approximation. As a first application, we address the steady-state of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard
model with two-body losses and incoherent pump. We show that DMFT captures hopping-induced dissipative
processes, completely missed in Gutzwiller mean-field theory, which crucially determine the
properties of the normal phase, including the redistribution of steady-state populations, the
suppression of local gain and the emergence of a stationary quantum-Zeno regime. We argue that these
processes compete with coherent hopping to determine the phase transition towards a non-equilibrium
superfluid, leading to a strong renormalization of the phase boundary at finite-connectivity.
We show that this transition occurs as a finite-frequency instability, leading to an oscillating-in-time
order parameter, that we connect with a quantum many-body synchronization transition of an array
of quantum van der Pol oscillators.

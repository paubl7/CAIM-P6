Understanding physical properties of quantum emitters strongly interacting with quantized electromagnetic
modes, both discrete and continuous spectra, is one of the primary goals in the emergent field of
waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED). When the light-matter coupling strength is comparable
to or even exceeds energies of elementary excitations, conventional approaches based on perturbative
treatment of light-matter interactions, two-level description of matter excitations, and photon-number
truncation are no longer sufficient. Here we study in and out of equilibrium properties of waveguide
QED in such nonperturbative regimes by developing a comprehensive and rigorous theoretical approach
using an asymptotic decoupling unitary transformation. We uncover several surprising features
ranging from symmetry-protected many-body bound states in the continuum to strong renormalization
of the effective mass and potential; the latter may explain recent experiments demonstrating cavity-induced
changes in chemical reactivity as well as enhancements of ferromagnetism or superconductivity.
We demonstrate these results by applying our general formalism to a model of coupled cavity arrays,
which is relevant to experiments in superconducting qubits interacting with microwave resonators
or atoms coupled to photonic crystals. We examine the relation between our results and delocalization-localization
transition in the spin-boson model; notably, we point out that one can find a quantum phase transition
akin to the superradiant transition in multi-emitter waveguide QED systems with superlinear photonic
dispersion. Besides waveguide resonators, we discuss possible applications of our framework
to other light-matter systems relevant to quantum optics, condensed matter physics, and quantum
chemistry.

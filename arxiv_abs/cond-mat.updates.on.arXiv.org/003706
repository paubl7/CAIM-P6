Using exact diagonalization, we study the projected Hamiltonian with Coulomb interaction in the
8 flat bands of first magic angle twisted bilayer graphene. Employing the U(4) (U(4)$\times$U(4))
symmetries in the nonchiral (chiral) flat band limit, we reduced the Hilbert space to an extent which
allows for study around $\nu=\pm 3,\pm2,\pm1$ fillings. In the first chiral limit $w_0/w_1=0$
where $w_0$ ($w_1$) is the $AA$ ($AB$) stacking hopping, we find that the ground-states at these
fillings are extremely well-described by Slater determinants in a so-called Chern basis, and the
exactly solvable charge $\pm1$ excitations found in [arXiv:2009.14200] are the lowest charge
excitations up to system sizes $8\times8$ (for restricted Hilbert space) in the chiral-flat limit.
We also find that the Flat Metric Condition (FMC) used in [arXiv:2009.11301,2009.11872,2009.12376,2009.13530,2009.14200]
for obtaining a series of exact ground-states and excitations holds in a large parameter space.
For $\nu=-3$, the ground state is the spin and valley polarized Chern insulator with $\nu_C=\pm1$
at $w_0/w_1\lesssim0.9$ (0.3) with (without) FMC. At $\nu=-2$, we can only numerically access
the valley polarized sector, and we find a spin ferromagnetic phase when $w_0/w_1\gtrsim0.5t$
where $t\in[0,1]$ is the factor of rescaling of the actual TBG bandwidth, and a spin singlet phase
otherwise, confirming the perturbative calculation [arXiv:2009.13530]. The analytic FMC ground
state is, however, predicted in the intervalley coherent sector which we cannot access [arXiv:2009.13530].
For $\nu=-3$ with/without FMC, when $w_0/w_1$ is large, the finite-size gap $\Delta$ to the neutral
excitations vanishes, leading to phase transitions. Further analysis of the ground state momentum
sectors at $\nu=-3$ suggests a competition among (nematic) metal, momentum $M_M$ ($\pi$) stripe
and $K_M$-CDW orders at large $w_0/w_1$.

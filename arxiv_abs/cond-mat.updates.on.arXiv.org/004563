The operators of localized spins within a magnetic material commute at different sites of its lattice
and anticommute on the same site, so they are neither fermionic nor bosonic operators. Thus, to construct
diagrammatic many-body perturbation theory, requiring the Wick theorem, the spin operators are
usually mapped to the bosonic ones -- the most popular in magnonics and spintronics literature has
been the Holstein-Primakoff (HP) transformation. However, the square root of operators in the
HP transformation has to be expanded into an infinite series, which is then truncated to some low
order to make calculations tractable. This poses a question on the {\em range of validity of truncated
HP transformation} when describing nonequilibrium dynamics of localized spins interacting with
conduction electron spins -- a problem frequently encountered in numerous transport phenomena
in spintronics. Here we apply exact diagonalization techniques to Hamiltonian of fermions (i.e.,
electrons) interacting with HP bosons vs. Hamiltonian of fermions interacting with the original
localized spin operators in order to compare their many-body states and one-particle Green functions.
For this purpose, we consider a one-dimensional quantum Heisenberg ferromagnetic metallic spin-$S$
XXX chain of $N \le 7$ sites, where $S=1$ or $S=5/2$ and electrons can hop between the sites while interacting
with localized spin via $sd$ exchange interaction. For two different versions of the Hamiltonian
for this model, we compare the structure of their ground states; time-evolution of excited states;
spectral functions computed from the retarded Green function in equilibrium; and the lesser nonequilibrium
Green function depending on two times.

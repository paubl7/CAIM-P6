Shear banding is a material instability in large strain plastic deformation of solids, where otherwise
homogeneous flow becomes localized in narrow micrometer-scale bands. Shear bands have broad implications
for materials processing and failure under dynamic loading in a wide variety of material systems
ranging from metals to rocks. This year marks 75 years since the publication of Zener and Hollomon's
pioneering work on shear bands which is widely credited with drawing the attention of the mechanics
community to shear bands and related localization phenomena. There has since been significant
experimental and theoretical investigation into the onset of shear banding. Yet, given the extremely
small length and time scales associated with band development, several challenges persist in studying
the evolution of single bands. Recent full-field displacement measurements, coupled with numerical
modeling, have only begun to ameliorate this problem. This article summarizes our present understanding
of plastic flow dynamics around single shear bands and the subsequent transition to fracture, with
special applications to materials processing. We begin with a semi-historical look at some of Zener's
early ideas on shear bands and discuss recent advances in experimental methods for mapping localized
flow during band formation, including direct \emph{in situ} imaging as well as \emph{ex situ}/post-mortem
analyses. Classical theories are revisited in the light of recently published experimental data.
Shear bands exhibit a wealth of complex flow characteristics that bear striking resemblance to
boundary layer phenomena in fluid flows. It is hoped that these will help further our understanding
of shear band dynamics, the subsequent transition to fracture, and lead to practical `control'
strategies for suppressing shear band-driven failures in processing applications.

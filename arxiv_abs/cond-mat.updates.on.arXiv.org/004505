At partial filling of a flat band, strong electronic interactions may favor gapped states harboring
emergent topology with quantized Hall conductivity. Emergent topological states have been found
in partially filled Landau levels and Hofstadter bands; in both cases, a large magnetic field is
required to engineer the underlying flat band. The recent observation of quantum anomalous Hall
effects (QAH) in narrow band moir\'e systems has led to the theoretical prediction that such phases
may be realized even at zero magnetic field. Here we report the experimental observation of insulators
with Chern number $C=1$ in the zero magnetic field limit at $\nu=3/2$ and $7/2$ filling of the moir\'e
superlattice unit cell in twisted monolayer-bilayer graphene (tMBG). Our observation of Chern
insulators at half-integer values of $\nu$ suggests spontaneous doubling of the superlattice
unit cell, in addition to spin- and valley-ferromagnetism. This is confirmed by Hartree-Fock calculations,
which find a topological charge density wave ground state at half filling of the underlying $C=2$
band, in which the Berry curvature is evenly partitioned between occupied and unoccupied states.
We find the translation symmetry breaking order parameter is evenly distributed across the entire
folded superlattice Brillouin zone, suggesting that the system is in the flat band, strongly correlated
limit. Our findings show that the interplay of quantum geometry and Coulomb interactions in moir\'e
bands allows for topological phases at fractional superlattice filling that spontaneously break
time-reversal symmetry, a prerequisite in pursuit of zero magnetic field phases harboring fractional
statistics as elementary excitations or bound to lattice dislocations.

We introduce a half-filled Hamiltonian of spin-half lattice fermions that can be studied with the
efficient meron-cluster algorithm in any dimension. As with the usual bipartite half-filled Hubbard
models, the na\"ive $U(2)$ symmetry is enhanced to $SO(4)$. On the other hand our model has a novel
spin-charge flip ${\mathbb Z}^C_2$ symmetry which is an important ingredient of free massless
fermions. In this work we focus on one spatial dimension, and show that our model can be viewed as a
lattice-regularized two-flavor chiral-mass Gross-Neveu model. Our model remains solvable in
the presence of the Hubbard coupling $U$, which maps to a combination of Gross-Neveu and Thirring
couplings in one dimension. Using the meron-cluster algorithm we find that the ground state of our
model is a valence bond solid when $U=0$. From our field theory analysis, we argue that the valence
bond solid forms inevitably because of an interesting frustration between spin and charge sectors
in the renormalization group flow enforced by the ${\mathbb Z}^C_2$ symmetry. This state spontaneously
breaks translation symmetry by one lattice unit, which can be identified with a $\mathbb{Z}_2^\chi$
chiral symmetry in the continuum. We show that increasing $U$ induces a quantum phase transition
to a critical phase described by the $SU(2)_1$ Wess-Zumino-Witten theory. The quantum critical
point between these two phases is known to exhibit a novel symmetry enhancement between spin and
dimer. Here we verify the scaling relations of these correlation functions near the critical point
numerically. Our study opens up the exciting possibility of numerical access to similar novel phase
transitions in higher dimensions in fermionic lattice models using the meron-cluster algorithm.

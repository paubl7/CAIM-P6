We employ the cluster slave-spin method to investigate systematically the ground state properties
of the Hubbard model on a square lattice with doping $\delta$ and coupling strength $U$ being its
parameters. In addition to a crossover reflected in the behavior of the antiferromagnetic gap $\Delta_{\text{AFM}}$,
this property can also be observed in the energetics of the cluster slave-spin Hamiltonian -- the
antiferromagnetism at small $U$ is due to the potential energy gain while that in the strong coupling
limit is driven by the kinetic energy gain, which is consistent with the results from the cluster
dynamical mean-field theory calculation and the quantum Monte Carlo simulation. We find the interaction
$U_{c}$ for the crossover in the AFM state, separating the weak- and strong- coupling regimes, almost
remains unchanged upon doping, and it is smaller than the critical coupling strength $U_{\text{Mott}}$
for the first-order metal-insulator Mott transition in the half-filled paramagnetic state. At
half-filling, a relationship between the staggered magnetization $M$ and $\Delta_{\text{AFM}}$
is established in the small $U$ limit to nullify the Hartree-Fock theory, and a first-order Mott
transition in the paramagnetic state is substantiated, which is characterized by discontinuities
and hystereses at $U_{\text{Mott}}=10t$. Finally, an overall phase diagram in the $U$-$\delta$
plane is presented, which is composed of four regimes: the antiferromagnetic insulator, the antiferromagnetic
metal with the compressibility $\kappa>0$ or $\kappa<0$, and the paramagnetic metal, as well as
three phase transitions: (i) From the antiferromagnetic metal to the paramagnetic metal, (ii)
between the antiferromagnetic metal phases with positive and negative $\kappa$, and (iii) separating
the antiferromagnetic insulating phase from the antiferromagnetic metal phase.

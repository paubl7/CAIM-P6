The recent discovery of guiding Dirac fermions in two-dimensional graphene by one-dimensional
electrostatic potential has paved the way for an electronic waveguides. However, identifying
these guided electronic modes using conventional probes like scanning tunneling microscopy and
quantum capacitance is challenging. In this work, we show that thermoelectric measurement using
one-dimensional local nano-heater is an excellent tool to probe guided modes in graphene. Our devices
consist of InAs nanowire (NW) and graphene vertical heterostructure, which are electrically isolated
by thin (~ 10nm) hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) layers. In contrast to conventional thermoelectric
measurements, where a heater is placed on one side of a sample, we use the InAs NW (diameter ~ 50 nm)
as a local heater placed in the middle of the graphene channel. We measure the thermoelectric voltage
induced in graphene due to Joule heating in the NW, as a function of temperature (1.5K - 50K) and carrier
concentration. The thermoelectric voltage across bilayer graphene (BLG) in NW-BLG devices follows
the predictions of Mott's formula with a sign change around the Dirac point. In contrast, the thermoelectric
voltage measured across monolayer graphene (MLG) in NW-MLG devices shows anomalous large-amplitude
oscillations around the Dirac point, not seen in the Mott response obtained from the electrical
conductivity data on the same device. The anomalous oscillations are a manifestation of confined
modes in MLG by the electrostatic potential of the NW, which is much weaker in the NW-BLG devices.
The calculated temperature profile in the heterostructure shows that the temperature gradient
is dominant in the graphene region underneath the NW, and thus the anomalous oscillations in thermoelectric
voltage are a sensitive probe of confined modes induced by the NW.

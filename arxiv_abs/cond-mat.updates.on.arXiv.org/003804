Developing techniques for high-quality synthesis of mono and few-layered 2D materials with lowered
complexity and cost continues to remain an important goal, both for accelerating fundamental research
and for applications development. We present the simplest conceivable technique to synthesize
micrometer-scale single-crystal triangular monolayers of MoS2, i.e. by direct heating of bulk
MoS2 powder onto proximally-placed substrates. Room-temperature excitonic linewidth values
of our samples are narrower and more uniform than those of 2D-MoS2 obtained by most other techniques
reported in literature, and comparable to those of ultraflat h-BN-capped mechanically exfoliated
samples, indicative of their high quality. Feature-rich Raman spectra absent in samples grown
or obtained by most other techniques, also stand out as a testament of the high quality of our samples.
A contact-growth mode facilitates direct growth of crystallographically-strained circular
samples, which allows us to directly compare the optoelectronic properties of flat vs. strained
growth from the same growth runs. Our method allows, for the first time, to quantitatively compare
the impact of strain on excitonic and Raman peak positions on identically-synthesized 2D-MoS2.
Strain leads to average Red-shifts of ~ 30 meV in the A-exciton position, and ~ 2 cm-1 in the E12g Raman
peak in these samples. Our findings open-up several new possibilities that expand 2D material research.
By eliminating the need for carrier gas flow, mechanical motion or chemical reactions, our method
can be either miniaturized for substantially low-cost, high-quality scientific research or potentially
scaled-up for mass-production of 2D crystals for commercial purposes. Moreover, we believe this
technique can also be extended to other transition metal dichalcogenides and other layered materials.

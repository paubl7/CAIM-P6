We study a sub monolayer He-4 adsorbed on fluorographene (GF) and on hexagonal boron nitride (hBN)
at low coverage. The adsorption potentials have been computed ab-initio with a suitable density
functional theory including dispersion forces. The properties of the adsorbed He-4 atoms have
been computed at finite temperature with path integral Monte Carlo and at T=0 K with variational
path integral. From both methods we find that the lowest energy state of He-4 on GF is a superfluid.
Due to the very large corrugation of the adsorption potential this superfluid has a very strong spatial
anisotropy, the ratio between the largest and smallest areal density being about 6. Thus, GF offers
a platform for studying the properties of a strongly interacting highly anisotropic bosonic superfluid.
At a larger coverage He-4 has a transition to an ordered commensurate state with occupation of 1/6
of the adsorption sites. The system has a triangular order similar to that of He-4 on graphite but
each He-4 atom is not confined to a single adsorption site and the atom visits also the nearest neighboring
sites giving rise to a novel three--lobed density distribution. The lowest energy state of He-4
on hBN is an ordered commensurate state with occupation of 1/3 of the adsorption sites and triangular
symmetry. A disordered state is present at lower coverage as a metastable state. In presence of an
electric field the corrugation of the adsorption potential is slightly increased but up to a magnitude
of 1 V/Ang the effect is small and does not change the stability of the phases of He-4 on GF and hBN. We
have verified that also in the case of graphene such electric field does not modify the stability
of the commensurate sqrt(3)*sqrt(3)R30 phase.

The genomics approach to materials, heralded by increasingly accurate density functional theory
(DFT) calculations conducted on thousands of crystalline compounds, has led to accelerated material
discovery and property predictions. However, so far amorphous materials have been largely excluded
from this as these systems are notoriously difficult to simulate. Here we study amorphous Ta$_2$O$_5$
thin films mixed with Al$_2$O$_3$, SiO$_2$, Sc$_2$O$_3$, TiO$_2$, ZnO, ZrO$_2$, Nb$_2$O$_5$
and HfO$_2$ to identify their crystalline structure upon post-deposition annealing in air both
experimentally and with simulations. Using the Materials Project open database, phase diagrams
based on DFT calculations are constructed for the mixed oxide systems and the annealing process
is evaluated via grand potential diagrams with varying oxygen chemical potential. Despite employing
calculations based on crystalline bulk materials, the predictions agree well with the experimentally
observed crystallized phases of the amorphous films. Only in two cases the database leads to incorrect
predictions: in TiO$_2$-doped Ta$_2$O$_5$ because it does not contain a ternary compound found
experimentally, and in Sc$_2$O$_3$-doped Ta$_2$O$_5$ because DFT overestimates the formation
enthalpy difference between Sc$_2$O$_3$ and Ta$_2$O$_5$ and thus does not reproduce observed
oxygen competition effects. In the absence of ternary phases, the dopant acts as an amorphizer agent
increasing the thermal stability of Ta$_2$O$_5$. These results show that DFT calculations can
be applied for the prediction of crystallized structures of annealed amorphous materials. This
could pave the way for accelerated \textit{in silico} material discovery and property predictions
using the powerful genomic approach for amorphous oxide coatings employed in a wide range of applications
such as optical coatings, energy storage and electronic devices.

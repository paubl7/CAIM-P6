Most single-molecule transport experiments produce large and stochastic datasets containing
a wide range of behaviors, presenting both a challenge to their analysis, but also an opportunity
for discovering new physical insights. Recently, several unsupervised clustering algorithms
have been developed to help extract and separate distinct features from single-molecule transport
data. However, these clustering approaches have been primarily designed and used to extract major
dataset components, and are consequently likely to struggle with identifying very rare features
and behaviors which may nonetheless contain physically meaningful information. In this work,
we thus introduce a completely new analysis framework specifically designed for rare event detection
in single-molecule break junction data to help unlock such information and provide a new perspective
with different implicit assumptions than clustering. Our approach leverages the concept of correlations
of breaking traces with their own history to robustly identify paths through distance-conductance
space that correspond to reproducible rare behaviors. As both a demonstrative and important example,
we focus on rare conductance plateaus for short molecules, which can be essentially invisible when
examining raw data. We show that our grid-based correlation tools successfully and reproducibly
locate these rare plateaus in real experimental datasets, including in situations that traditional
clustering approaches find challenging. This result enables a broader variety of molecules to
be considered in the future, and suggests that our new approach is a useful tool for detecting rare
yet meaningful behaviors in single molecule transport data more generally.

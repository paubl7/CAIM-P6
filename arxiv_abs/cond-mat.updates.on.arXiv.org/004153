We investigated the influence of oxygen over-stoichiometry on apical oxygen disorder and magnetic
correlations in Nd2NiO4+d (d~0.11) in the temperature range of 2-300 K by means of synchrotron x-ray
powder diffraction, neutron single crystal and powder diffraction studies, combined with macroscopic
magnetic measurements. In the investigated temperature range, the compound crystalizes in a tetragonal
commensurate structure with the P42/ncm space group with excess oxygen atoms occupy the 4b (3/4
1/4 1/4) interstitial sites, coordinated by four apical oxygen atoms. Large and anisotropic thermal
displacement parameters are found for equatorial and apical oxygen atoms, which are strongly reduced
on an absolute scale compared to the Nd2NiO4.23 phase. Maximum Entropy analysis of the neutron single
crystal diffraction data uncovered anharmonic contributions to the displacement parameters
of the apical oxygen atoms, toward the nearest vacant 4b interstitial site, related to the phonon
assisted oxygen diffusion mechanism. Macroscopic magnetization measurements and neutron powder
diffraction studies reveal long-range antiferromagnetic ordering of the Ni-sublattice at TN
~ 53 K with a weak ferromagnetic component along the c-axis, while the long-range magnetic ordering
of the Nd-sublattice occurs below 10 K. Temperature dependent neutron diffraction patterns show
the appearance of a commensurate magnetic order at TN with the propagation vector k = (100) and the
emergence of an additional incommensurate phase below 30 K, while both phases coexist at 2 K. The
commensurate magnetic structure is best described by the P42/nc`m` Shubnikov space group. Refined
magnetic moments of the Ni and Nd-sites at 2 K are 1.144(76) muB and 1.632(52) muB respectively. A
possible origin of the incommensurate phase is discussed and a tentative magnetic phase diagram
is proposed.

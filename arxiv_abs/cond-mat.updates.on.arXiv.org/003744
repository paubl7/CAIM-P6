In this study, we evaluate the typical reverse annealing (RA) performance of the code-division
multiple-access (CDMA) multiuser demodulator by means of statistical mechanics using the replica
method. If we prepare for the proper initial states, the first-order phase transition, which is
troublesome in estimating the original signals, can be avoided or mitigated. As we increase the
difficulty to obtain the ground state, further information regarding the ground state of the original
problems is required to avoid the first-order phase transition. In our theoretical analysis, we
assume the replica symmetry and the static approximation. To verify our analytical results, we
perform quantum Monte Carlo simulations. The analytical results are consistent with the numerical
results, except for the intermediate values of the annealing parameter. Moreover, we derive the
Almeida--Thouless (AT) condition for the CDMA model in RA. In our problem settings, the AT condition
holds. The deviation between the analytical and numerical results is owing to the breaking of the
static approximation. Thus, to investigate the effects of the static approximation, we perform
RA without quantum fluctuations. In this case, the numerical results agree with the analytical
results. Furthermore, we test the practical performance of RA with the initial candidate solutions
obtained by the approximate message passing algorithm. Even if the threshold of the fraction of
the ground state in the initial Hamiltonian to avoid the first-order phase transition can not be
reached, RA can increase the magnetization and enhance the ratio of the perfect estimation. This
study is the first analytical demonstration of the application of RA to practical inference problems.

Many animals and robots move using undulatory motion of their bodies. When in close proximity undulatory
motion can lead to novel collective behaviors such as gait synchronization, spatial reconfiguration,
and clustering. Here we study the role of contact interactions between model undulatory swimmers:
three-link robots in experiment and multi-link robots in simulation. The undulatory gait of each
swimmer is generated through a time-dependent sinusoidal-like waveform which has a fixed phase
offset, $\phi$. By varying the phase relationship between neighboring swimmers we seek to study
how contact forces and spatial configurations are governed by the phase difference between neighboring
swimmers. We find that undulatory actuation in close proximity drives neighboring swimmers into
spatial equilibrium configurations that depend on the actuation phase difference. We propose
a model for spatial equilibrium of nearest neighbor undulatory swimmers which we call the gait compatibility
condition, which is the set of spatial and gait configurations in which no collisions occur. Robotic
experiments with two, three, and four swimmers exhibit good agreement with the compatibility model.
To probe the interaction potential between undulatory swimmers we perturb the each longitudinally
from their equilibrium configurations and we measure their steady-state displacement. These
studies reveal that undulatory swimmers in close proximity exhibit cohesive longitudinal interaction
forces that drive the swimmers from incompatible to compatible configurations. This system of
undulatory swimmers provides new insight into active-matter systems which move through body undulation.
In addition to the importance of velocity and orientation coherence in active-matter swarms, we
demonstrate that undulatory phase coherence is also important for generating stable, cohesive
group configurations.

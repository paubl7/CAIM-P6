This thesis pretends to be another step in the development of numerical research in disordered systems.
Specifically, we will focus on spin glasses which have demonstrated to be a fertile field from both,
experimental and theoretical approaches. Throughout this thesis, we will discuss a variety of
interesting phenomenons and we will also open new avenues to previously unexplored effects in the
context of spin glasses. However, without a doubt, the leitmotiv conducting this thesis is the role
of numerical simulations as a valuable tool to explore spin-glass physics. This thesis is organized
into five different parts. The first part, containing the Chapter 1, is focused on introducing the
spin glasses to the reader. The second part, containing the Chapter 2, is dedicated to discussing
the metastate. The third part, shaped by the Chapter 3 and Chapter 4, is devoted to studying the off-equilibrium
dynamics in spin glasses. Specifically, Chapter 3 is focused on discussing the growth of the coherence
length in spin glasses, a key quantity that characterizes the off-equilibrium evolution of those
systems. In Chapter 4 we will discuss an interesting phenomenon: the Mpemba effect. The fourth part,
containing the Chapter 5, Chapter 6 and Chapter 7 is devoted to study the Temperature Chaos phenomenon
in spin glasses. In Chapter 5 we introduce the main historical results on Temperature Chaos, from
its origins to the last steps. In Chapter 6 we study equilibrated spin glasses and we characterize
the Temperature Chaos from a static and a dynamical point of view. In Chapter 7 we tackle the problem
of characterizing Temperature Chaos in off-equilibrium dynamics. The fifth and last part of the
main body of the thesis corresponds to the conclusions.

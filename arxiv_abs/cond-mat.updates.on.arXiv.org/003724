Yb3+-doped inorganic metal-halide perovskites (Yb3+:CsPbX3, X = Cl, Br) have recently been discovered
to display highly efficient quantum cutting, in which the energy from individual blue or UV photons
absorbed by the material is re-emitted in the form of pairs of near-infrared photons by Yb3+ dopants.
Experimental photoluminescence quantum yields approaching 200{%} have been reported. As the
first quantum-cutting materials that combine such high photoluminescence quantum yields with
strong, broadband absorption in the visible, these materials offer unique opportunities for enhancing
the efficiencies of solar technologies. Little is known about the fundamental origins of this quantum
cutting, however. Here, we describe variable-temperature and time-resolved photoluminescence
studies of Yb3+:CsPbCl3 in two disparate forms - colloidal nanocrystals and macroscopic single
crystals. Both forms show very similar spectroscopic properties, demonstrating that quantum
cutting is an intrinsic property of the Yb3+:CsPbX3 composition itself. Diverse Yb3+ speciation
is observed in both forms by low-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy, but remarkably,
quantum cutting is dominated by the same specific Yb3+ species in both cases. Time-resolved photoluminescence
measurements provide direct evidence of the previously hypothesized intermediate state in the
quantum-cutting mechanism. This intermediate state mediates relaxation from the photogenerated
excited state of the perovskite to the emissive excited state of Yb3+, and hence is of critical mechanistic
importance. At room temperature, this intermediate state is populated within a few picoseconds
and has a decay time of only ~ 7 ns in both nanocrystalline and single-crystal Yb3+:CsPbCl3. The mechanistic
implications of these observations are discussed.

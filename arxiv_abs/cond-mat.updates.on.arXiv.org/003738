The interactions between electrons and lattice vibrational modes play the key role in determining
the carrier transport properties, thermoelectric performance and other physical quantities
related to phonons in semiconductors. However, for two-dimensional (2D) materials, the widely-used
models for carrier transport only consider the interactions between electrons and some specific
phonon modes, which usually leads to inaccruate predictions of electrons/phonons transport properties.
In this work, comprehensive investigations on full electron-phonon couplings and their influences
on carrier mobility and thermoelectric performances of 2D group-IV and V elemental monolayers
were performed, and we also analyzed in details the selection rules on electron-phonon couplings
using group-theory arguments. Our calculations revealed that, for the cases of shallow dopings
where only intravalley scatterings are allowed, the contributions from optical phonon modes are
significantly larger than those from acoustic phonon modes in group-IV elemental monolayers,
and LA and some specific optical phonon modes contribute significantly to the total intravalley
scatterings. When the doping increases and intervalley scatterings are allowed, the intervalley
scatterings are much stronger than intravalley scatterings, and ZA/TA/LO phonon modes dominate
the intervalley scatterings in monolayer Si, Ge and Sn. The dominant contributions to the total
intervalley scatterings are ZA/TO in monolayer P, ZA/TO in monolayer As and TO/LO in monolayer Sb.
Based on the thorough investigations on the full electron-phonon couplings, we predict accurately
the carrier mobilities and thermoelectric figure of merits in these two elemental crystals, and
reveal significant reductions when compared with the calculations based on the widely-used simplified
model.

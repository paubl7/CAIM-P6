We investigate eigen oscillations of internal degrees of freedom (Higgs mode and Goldstone mode)
of two-band superconductors using generalization of the extended time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau
theory formulated in a work Grigorishin (2021) \cite{grig2} for the case of two coupled order parameters
by both the internal proximity effect and the drag effect. It is demonstrated, that Goldstone mode
splits into two branches: common mode oscillations with acoustic spectrum, which is absorbed by
gauge field, and anti-phase oscillations with energy gap (mass) in spectrum determined by interband
coupling, which can be associated with Leggett mode. Analogously, Higgs oscillations splits into
two branches also: massive one, whose energy gap vanishes at critical temperature $T_{c}$, another
massive one, whose energy gap does not vanish at $T_{c}$. It is demonstrated, that the second branch
of Higgs mode is nonphysical, and it with Leggett mode together can be removed with special choice
of coefficient at the "drag" term in Lagrangian. In the same time, such choice leaves only one coherence
length, thereby prohibiting so-called type-1.5 superconductors. We analyze experimental data
about Josephson effect between two-band superconductors. In particular, it is demonstrated,
that the resonant enhancement of the DC current through a Josephson junction at a resonant bias voltage
$V_{\mathrm{res}}$, when the Josephson frequency or its harmonics match the frequency of some
internal oscillation mode or its harmonics in two-band superconductors (banks), can be explained
with the coupling between AC Josephson current and Higgs oscillations in two-band superconductors.
Thus, explanation of the effect does not need Leggett mode.

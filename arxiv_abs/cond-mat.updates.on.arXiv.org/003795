Refractory high entropy alloys (R-HEAs) are having properties and uses as high strength and high
hardness materials for ambient and high temperature, aerospace and nuclear radiation tolerance
applications, orthopedic applications etc. The mechanical properties like yield strength and
ductility of TaNbHfZr R-HEA depend on the local nanostructure and chemical ordering. In this study
we have computationally obtained various properties of the TaNbHfZr alloy like the role of configurational
entropy in the thermodynamic property, rate of evolution of nanostructure morphology in thermally
annealed systems, dislocation simulation based quantitative prediction of yield strength, nature
of dislocation movement through short range clustering (SRC) and qualitative prediction of ductile
to brittle transition behavior. The simulation starts with hybrid Monte Carlo/ Molecular Dynamics
(MC/MD) based nanostructure evolution of an initial random solid solution alloy structure with
BCC lattice structure created with principal axes along [1 1 1], [-1 1 0] and [-1 -1 2] directions suitable
for simulation of 1/2[1 1 1] edge dislocations. Thermodynamic properties are calculated from the
change in enthalpy and the configurational entropy by next-neighbor bond counting statistics.
The MC/MD evolved structures mimic the annealing treatment at 1800{\deg}C and the output structures
are replicated in periodic directions to make larger 384000 atom structures used for dislocation
simulations. Edge dislocations were utilized to obtain and explain for the extra strengthening
observed because of the formations of SRCs. Lastly the MC/MD evolved structures containing dislocations
are subjected to a high shear stress beyond CRSS to investigate the stability of the dislocations
and the lattice structures to explain the experimentally observed transition from ductile to brittle
behavior for the TaNbHfZr R-HEA.

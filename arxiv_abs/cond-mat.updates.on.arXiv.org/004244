Hyperuniform many-body systems in $d$-dimensional Euclidean space are characterized by completely
suppressed (normalized) infinite-wavelength density fluctuations, and appear to be endowed
with novel exotic physical properties. In this work, we analyze the effects of localized defects
on the density fluctuations across length scales and on the hyperuniformity property of experimental
samples of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides. In particular, we extract atomic
coordinates from time series annular dark field-scanning transmission electron microscopy imaging
data of 2D tungsten chalcogenides with the 2H structure showing continuous development and evolution
of electron-beam induced defects, and construct the corresponding chemical-bonding informed
coordination networks between the atoms. We then compute a variety of pair statistics and bond-orientational
statistics to characterize the samples. At low defect concentrations, the corresponding materials
are nearly hyperuniform. As more defects are introduced, the (approximate) hyperuniformity of
the materials is gradually destroyed, and the system becomes non-hyperuniform even when the material
still contains a significant amount of crystalline regions. At high defect concentrations, the
structures become antihyperuniform with diverging (normalized) large-scale density fluctuations.
Overall, the defected materials possess varying degrees of orientation order, and there is apparently
no intermediate hexatic phase emerging. We also construct a minimalist structural model and demonstrate
that the experimental samples can be essentially viewed as perturbed honeycomb crystals with small
correlated displacements and double chalcogen vacancies.

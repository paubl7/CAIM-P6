Across all scales of the physical world, dynamical systems can often be usefully represented as
abstract networks that encode the system's units and inter-unit interactions. Understanding
how physical rules shape the topological structure of those networks can clarify a system's function
and enhance our ability to design, guide, or control its behavior. In the emerging area of quantum
network science, a key challenge lies in distinguishing between the topological properties that
reflect a system's underlying physics and those that reflect the assumptions of the employed conceptual
model. To elucidate and address this challenge, we study networks that represent non-equilibrium
quantum-electronic transport through quantum antidot devices -- an example of an open, mesoscopic
quantum system. The network representations correspond to two different models of internal antidot
states: a single-particle, non-interacting model and an effective model for collective excitations
including Coulomb interactions. In these networks, nodes represent accessible energy states
and edges represent allowed transitions. We find that both models reflect spin conservation rules
in the network topology through bipartiteness and the presence of only even-length cycles. The
models diverge, however, in the minimum length of cycle basis elements, in a manner that depends
on whether electrons are considered to be distinguishable. Furthermore, the two models reflect
spin-conserving relaxation effects differently, as evident in both the degree distribution and
the cycle-basis length distribution. Collectively, these observations serve to elucidate the
relationship between network structure and physical constraints in quantum-mechanical models.
More generally, our approach underscores the utility of network science in understanding the dynamics
and control of quantum systems.

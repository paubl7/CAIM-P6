In the Landau levels of a two-dimensional electron system or when flat bands are present, e.g. in
twisted van der Waals bilayers, strong electron-electron interaction gives rise to quantum Hall
ferromagnetism with spontaneously broken symmetries in the spin and isospin sectors. Quantum
Hall ferromagnets support a rich variety of low-energy collective excitations that are instrumental
to understand the nature of the magnetic ground states and are also potentially useful as carriers
of quantum information. Probing such collective excitations, especially their dispersion {\omega}(k),
has been experimentally challenging due to small sample size and measurement constraints. In this
work, we demonstrate an all-electrical approach that integrates a Fabry-P\'erot cavity with non-equilibrium
transport to achieve the excitation, wave vector selection and detection of spin waves in graphene
heterostructures. Our experiments reveal gapless, linearly dispersed spin wave excitations
in the E = 0 Landau level of bilayer graphene, thus providing direct experimental evidence for a predicted
canted antiferromagnetic order. We show that the gapless spin wave mode propagates with a high group
velocity of several tens of km/s and maintains phase coherence over a distance of many micrometers.
Its dependence on the magnetic field and temperature agree well with the hydrodynamic theory of
spin waves. These results lay the foundation for the quest of spin superfluidity in this high-quality
material. The resonant cavity technique we developed offers a powerful and timely method to explore
the collective excitation of many spin and isospin-ordered many-body ground states in van der Waals
heterostructures and open the possibility of engineering magnonic devices.

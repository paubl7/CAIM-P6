General physical background of Peres-Horodecki positive partial transpose (ppt-) separability
criterion is revealed. Especially, the physical sense of partial transpose operation is shown
to be equivalent to the "local causality reversal" (LCR-) procedure for all separable quantum systems
or to the uncertainty in a global time arrow direction in all entangled cases. Using these universal
causal considerations the heuristic causal separability criterion has been proposed for arbitrary
$ D^{N} \times D^{N}$ density matrices acting in $ \mathcal{H}_{D}^{\otimes N} $ Hilbert spaces
which describe the ensembles of $ N $ quantum systems of $ D $ eigenstates each. Resulting general
formulas have been then analyzed for the widest special type of one-parametric density matrices
of arbitrary dimensionality, which model equivalent quantum subsystems being equally connected
(EC-) with each other by means of a single entnaglement parameter $ p $. In particular, for the family
of such EC-density matrices it has been found that there exists a number of $ N $- and $ D $-dependent
separability (or entanglement) thresholds $ p_{th}(N,D) $ which in the case of a qubit-pair density
matrix in $ \mathcal{H}_{2} \otimes \mathcal{H}_{2} $ Hilbert space are shown to reduce to well-known
results obtained earlier by Peres [5] and Horodecki [6]. As the result, a number of remarkable features
of the entanglement thresholds for EC-density matrices has been described for the first time. All
novel results being obtained for the family of arbitrary EC-density matrices are shown to be applicable
for a wide range of both interacting and non-interacting multi-partite quantum systems, such as
arrays of qubits, spin chains, ensembles of quantum oscillators, strongly correlated quantum
many-body systems with the possibility of many-body localization, etc.

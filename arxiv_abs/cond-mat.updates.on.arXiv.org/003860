Considering the large deviations of activity and current in the Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Process
(ASEP), we show that there exists a non-trivial correspondence between the joint scaled cumulant
generating functions of activity and current of two ASEPs with different parameters. This mapping
is obtained by applying a similarity transform on the deformed Markov matrix of the source model
in order to obtain the deformed Markov matrix of the target model. We first derive this correspondence
for periodic boundary conditions, and show in the diffusive scaling limit (corresponding to the
Weakly Asymmetric Simple Exclusion Processes, or WASEP) how the mapping is expressed in the language
of Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory (MFT). As an interesting specific case, we map the large deviations
of current in the ASEP to the large deviations of activity in the SSEP, thereby uncovering a regime
of Kardar-Parisi-Zhang in the distribution of activity in the SSEP. At large activity, particle
configurations exhibit hyperuniformity [Jack et al., PRL 114 060601 (2015)]. Using results from
quantum spin chain theory, we characterize the hyperuniform regime by evaluating the small wavenumber
asymptotic behavior of the structure factor at half-filling. Conversely, we formulate from the
MFT results a conjecture for a correlation function in spin chains at any fixed total magnetization
(in the thermodynamic limit). In addition, we generalize the mapping to the case of two open ASEPs
with boundary reservoirs, and we apply it in the WASEP limit in the MFT formalism. This mapping also
allows us to find a symmetry-breaking dynamical phase transition (DPT) in the WASEP conditioned
by activity, from the prior knowledge of a DPT in the WASEP conditioned by the current.

This paper presents the predictive accuracy using two-variate meteorological factors, average
temperature and average humidity, in neural network algorithms. We analyze result in five learning
architectures such as the traditional artificial neural network, deep neural network, and extreme
learning machine, long short-term memory, and long-short-term memory with peephole connections,
after manipulating the computer-simulation. Our neural network modes are trained on the daily
time-series dataset during seven years (from 2014 to 2020). From the trained results for 2500, 5000,
and 7500 epochs, we obtain the predicted accuracies of the meteorological factors produced from
outputs in ten metropolitan cities (Seoul, Daejeon, Daegu, Busan, Incheon, Gwangju, Pohang, Mokpo,
Tongyeong, and Jeonju). The error statistics is found from the result of outputs, and we compare
these values to each other after the manipulation of five neural networks. As using the long-short-term
memory model in testing 1 (the average temperature predicted from the input layer with six input
nodes), Tonyeong has the lowest root mean squared error (RMSE) value of 0.866 $(%)$ in summer from
the computer-simulation in order to predict the temperature. To predict the humidity, the RMSE
is shown the lowest value of 5.732 $(%)$, when using the long short-term memory model in summer in
Mokpo in testing 2 (the average humidity predicted from the input layer with six input nodes). Particularly,
the long short-term memory model is is found to be more accurate in forecasting daily levels than
other neural network models in temperature and humidity forecastings. Our result may provide a
computer-simuation basis for the necessity of exploring and develping a novel neural network evaluation
method in the future.

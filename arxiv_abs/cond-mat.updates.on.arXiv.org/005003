The two-dimensional (2d) Ising model is the statistical physics textbook example for phase transitions
and their kinetics. Quenched through the Curie point with Glauber rates, the late-time description
of the ferromagnetic domain coarsening finds its place at the scalar sector of the Allen-Cahn (Model
A) class. Resisting exact results sought since Lifshitz's account in 1962, central quantities
in 2d Model A $-$ most scaling exponents and correlation functions $-$ remain known up to approximate
theories whose disparate outcomes urge experimental assessment. Here, we perform such assessment
from a comprehensive study of the coarsening of 2d twisted nematic liquid crystals whose kinetics
is induced by a super-fast switching from a spatiotemporally chaotic state to a two-phase concurrent,
equilibrium one. Tracking the dynamics via optical microscopy, we firstly show the sharp evidence
of well-established Model A aspects, such as the dynamic exponent $z=2$ and the dynamic scaling
hypothesis, to then move forward. We confirm the Bray-Humayun theory for Porod's regime describing
intradomain length scales of spatial correlators, and show that their nontrivial decay beyond
that regime is captured in a free-from-parameter fashion by Gaussian theories. These paradigmatic
theories, however, do not perform well for time-related Model A statistics. We reveal that the collapsed
form of two-time correlators is best accounted for by the local scaling invariance theory, along
with the Fisher-Huse conjecture. We also suggest the true value for the local persistence exponent,
in disfavour of Gaussian models, and extract a universal fractal dimension for the morphology of
persistence clusters that is notably close to the golden ratio. Given its accuracy and possibilities,
this experimental setup may work as a prototype to address universality issues in the realm of nonequilibrium
systems.

Robust edge transport can occur when particles in crystalline lattices interact with an external
magnetic field. This system is well described by Bloch's theorem, with the spectrum being composed
of bands of bulk states and in-gap edge states. When the confining lattice geometry is altered to
be quasicrystaline, then Bloch's theorem breaks down. However, we still expect to observe the basic
characteristics of bulk states and current carrying edge states. Here, we show that for quasicrystals
in magnetic fields, there is also a third option; the bulk localised transport states. These states
share the in-gap nature of the well-known edge states and can support transport along them, but they
are fully contained within the bulk of the system, with no support along the edge. We consider both
finite and infinite systems, using rigorous error controlled computational techniques that are
not prone to finite-size effects. The bulk localised transport states are preserved for infinite
systems, in stark contrast to the normal edge states. This allows for transport to be observed in
infinite systems, without any perturbations, defects, or boundaries being introduced. We confirm
the in-gap topological nature of the bulk localised transport states for finite and infinite systems
by computing common topological measures; namely the Bott index and local Chern marker. The bulk
localised transport states form due to a magnetic aperiodicity arising from the interplay of length
scales between the magnetic field and quasiperiodic lattice. Bulk localised transport could have
interesting applications similar to those of the edge states on the boundary, but that could now
take advantage of the larger bulk of the lattice. The infinite size techniques introduced here,
especially the calculation of topological measures, could also be widely applied to other crystalline,
quasicrystalline, and disordered models.

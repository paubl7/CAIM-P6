We use molecular dynamics simulations to probe hydration, ion spacing, and cation-anion interaction
in two sulfonated polysulfones with different ion distributions along the polymer backbone. At
room temperature, these polymers remain in a glassy state even with water contents more than 10%.
At the equilibrium water uptake, the ions exhibit a similar level of hydration as they would in their
saturated aqueous solution. The framework of Manning's limiting law for counterion condensation
is used to examine ionic interactions in the simulated polysulfones. The dielectric constant that
the ions experience can be well approximated by a volume-weighted average of the dielectric constants
of the polymer backbone and water. Our results show that a reasonable estimate of the average inter-ion
distance, b, is obtained by using the distance where the sulfonate-sulfonate coordination number
reaches 1. The spacing of the sulfonate ions along the polysulfone backbone plays a role in determining
their spatial distribution inside the hydrated polymer. As a result, the value of b is slightly larger
for polymers where the sulfonate ions are more evenly spaced along the backbone, which is consistent
with experimental evidence. The simulations reveal that the sulfonate ions and sodium counterions
form fibrillar aggregates at water contents below the equilibrium water uptake. Such extensive
ionic aggregates are expected to facilitate ion transport in sulfonated polysulfone membranes,
without the need for long-range chain motion as in the case of traditional rubbery ionic polymers.
Our estimates for the dielectric constant and b are used in conjunction with Manning's theory to
estimate the fraction of counterions condensed to the fixed ions. The prediction of Manning's theory
agrees well with the simulation result.

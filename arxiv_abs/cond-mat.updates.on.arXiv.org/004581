A creased thin disk is generally bistable since the crease could be pushed through to form a stable
cone-like inverted state with an elastic singularity corresponding to the vertex of the conical
surface. In a recent study, we found that this bistability could be destroyed by removing the singularity
through cutting a hole around the vertex, depending on the size and shape of the hole. This paper extends
our recent work and is based on the following observations in tabletop models of creased disks with
circular holes: (i) reducing the circumference of the creased disk by removing an annular sector
could increase the hole size to be as large as the disk without destroying the bistability, (ii) with
a single crease, the circular hole could be as large as the disk without loss of the bistability, and
(iii) a family of stable inverted states can be obtained by inverting the disk almost anywhere along
the crease. An inextensible strip model is implemented to investigate these phenomena. We formulate
a minimal facet of the creased disk as a two-point boundary value problem with the creases modeled
as nonlinear hinges, and use numerical continuation to conduct parametric studies. Specifically,
we focus on geometric parameters which include an angle deficit that determines the circumference
of the disk, the rest crease angle, the number of evenly distributed creases, and an eccentricity
that determines the position of the hole on the crease. Our numerical results confirm the qualitative
observations in (i)-(iii) and further reveal unexpected results caused by the coupling between
these geometric parameters. Our results demonstrate that by varying the geometry of a simply creased
disk, surprisingly rich nonlinear behaviors can be obtained, which shed new light on the mechanics
and design of origami, kirigami, and morphable structures.

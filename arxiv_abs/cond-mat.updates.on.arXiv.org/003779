Finite temperature auxiliary field-based Quantum Monte Carlo methods, including Determinant
Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) and Auxiliary Field Quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC), have historically
assumed pivotal roles in the investigation of the finite temperature phase diagrams of a wide variety
of multidimensional lattice models and materials. Despite their utility, however, these techniques
are typically formulated in the grand canonical ensemble, which makes them difficult to apply to
condensates like superfluids and difficult to benchmark against alternative methods that are
formulated in the canonical ensemble. Working in the grand canonical ensemble is furthermore accompanied
by the increased overhead associated with having to determine the chemical potentials that produce
desired fillings. Given this backdrop, in this work, we present a new recursive approach for performing
AFQMC simulations in the canonical ensemble that does not require knowledge of chemical potentials.
To derive this approach, we exploit the convenient fact that AFQMC solves the many-body problem
by decoupling many-body propagators into integrals over one-body problems to which non-interacting
theories can be applied. We benchmark the accuracy of our technique on illustrative Bose and Fermi
Hubbard models and demonstrate that it can converge more quickly to the ground state than grand canonical
AFQMC simulations. We believe that our novel use of HS-transformed operators to implement algorithms
originally derived for non-interacting systems will motivate the development of a variety of other
methods and anticipate that our technique will enable direct performance comparisons against
other many-body approaches formulated in the canonical ensemble.

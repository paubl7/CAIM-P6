Recent experiments have observed that the chemical and photophysical properties of molecules
can be modified inside an optical Fabry-Perot microcavity under collective vibrational strong
coupling (VSC) conditions, and such modification is currently not well understood by theory. In
an effort to understand the origin of such cavity induced phenomena, some recent studies have focused
on the effect of the cavity environment on the nonlinear optical response of the molecular subsystem.
Here, we use a recently proposed protocol for classical cavity molecular dynamics (CavMD) simulations
to numerically investigate the linear and nonlinear response of liquid carbon dioxide under such
VSC conditions following an optical pulse excitation. We find that applying a strong pulse of excitation
to the lower hybrid light-matter state, i.e., the lower polariton (LP), can lead to an overall molecular
nonlinear absorption which is enhanced by up to two orders of magnitude relative to the excitation
outside the cavity. This polariton-enhanced multiphoton absorption also causes an ultrashort
LP lifetime (0.2 ps) under strong illumination. Unlike usual polariton relaxation processes --
whereby polaritonic energy transfers directly to the manifold of singly excited vibrational dark
states -- under the present mechanism, the LP transfers energy directly to the manifold of higher
vibrationally excited dark states; these highly excited dark states subsequently relax to the
manifold of singly excited states with a lifetime of tens of ps. Because the present mechanism is
generic in nature, we expect these numerical predictions to be experimentally observed in different
molecular systems and in cavities with different volumes.

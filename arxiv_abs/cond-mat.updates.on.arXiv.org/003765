Molecular agitation more rapid than thermal Brownian motion is reported for cellular environments,
motor proteins, synthetic molecular motors, enzymes, and common chemical reactions, yet that
chemical activity couples to molecular motion contrasts with generations of accumulated knowledge
about diffusion at equilibrium. To test the limits of this idea, a critical testbed is mobility of
catalytically active enzymes. Sentiment is divided about reality of enhanced enzyme diffusion
with evidence for and against. Here a master curve shows that enzyme diffusion coefficient increases
in proportion to the energy release rate, the product of Michaelis-Menten reaction rate and Gibbs
free energy change with the highly satisfactory correlation coefficient of 0.97. For ten catalytic
enzymes (urease, acetylcholinesterase, seven enzymes from the glucose cascade cycle, and another),
our measurements span from roughly 40% enhanced diffusion coefficient at high turnover rate and
negative Gibbs free energy to no enhancement at slow turnover rate and positive Gibbs free energy.
Moreover, two independent measures of mobility show consistency, provided that one avoids undesirable
fluorescence photophysics. The master curve presented here quantifies the limits of both ideas,
that enzymes display enhanced diffusion and that they do not within instrumental resolution, and
has possible implications for understanding enzyme mobility in cellular environments. The striking
linear dependence for the exergonic enzymes (negative Gibbs free energy) together with the vanishing
effect for endergonic enzyme (positive Gibbs free energy) are consistent with a physical picture
where the mechanism boosting the diffusion is an active one, utilizing the available work from the
chemical reaction.

The discovery of magnetism in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) materials has flourished
a new endeavour of fundamental problems in magnetism as well as potential applications in computing,
sensing and storage technologies. Of particular interest are antiferromagnets, which due to their
intrinsic antiferromagnetic exchange coupling show several advantages in relation to ferromagnets
such as robustness against external magnetic perturbations. This property is one of the cornerstones
of antiferromagnets and implies that information stored in antiferromagnetic domains is invisible
to applied magnetic fields preventing it from being erased or manipulated. Here we show that, despite
this fundamental understanding, the magnetic domains of recently discovered vdW MnPS3 antiferromagnet
can be controlled via external magnetic fields and currents. We realize ultrafast domain-wall
dynamics with velocities up to 1500 m/s and 3000 m/s respectively to a broad range of fields and current
densities. Both domain wall dynamics are determined by the edge terminations which generated uncompensated
spins following the underlying symmetry of the honeycomb structure. We find that edge atoms belonging
to different magnetic sublattices function as geometrical constrictions preventing the displacement
of the wall, whereas having atoms of the same sublattice at both edges of the material allows for the
field-driven domain wall motion which is only limited by the spin-flop transition of the antiferromagnet
beyond 25 T. Conversely, electric currents can induce motion of domain walls in most of the edges
except those where the two sublattices are present at the borders (e.g. armchair edges). Our results
indicate that the implementation of 2D vdW antiferromagnets in real applications requires the
engineering of the layer edges which enables an unprecedented functional feature in ultrathin
device platforms.

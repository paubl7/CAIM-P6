The effective electron-electron interaction in the electron gas depends on both the density and
spin local field factors. Variational Diagrammatic Quantum Monte Carlo calculations of the spin
local field factor are reported and used to quantitatively present the full spin-dependent, electron-electron
interaction. Together with the charge local field factor from previous Diffusion Quantum Monte
Carlo calculations, we obtain the complete form of the effective electron-electron interaction
in the uniform three-dimensional electron gas. Very simple quadratic formulas are presented for
the local field factors that quantitatively produce all of the response functions of the electron
gas at metallic densities. Exchange and correlation become increasingly important at low densities.
At the compressibility divergence at rs = 5.25, both the direct (screened Coulomb) term and the charge-dependent
exchange term in the electron-electron interaction at q=0 are separately divergent. However,
due to large cancellations, their difference is finite, well behaved, and much smaller than either
term separately. As a result, the spin contribution to the electron-electron interaction becomes
an important factor. The static electron-electron interaction is repulsive as a function of density
but is less repulsive for electrons with parallel spins. The effect of allowing a deformable, rather
than rigid, positive background is shown to be as quantitatively important as exchange and correlation.
As a simple concrete example, the electron-electron interaction is calculated using the measured
bulk modulus of the alkali metals with a linear phonon dispersion. The net electron-electron interaction
in lithium is attractive for wave vectors $0-2k_F$, which suggests superconductivity, and is mostly
repulsive for the other alkali metals.

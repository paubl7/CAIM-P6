At a temperature of roughly 1\,K, \ce{Sr2RuO4} undergoes a transition from a normal Fermi liquid
to a superconducting phase. Even while the former is relatively simple and well understood, the
superconducting state is not even after 25 years of study. More recently it has been found that critical
temperatures can be enhanced by application of uniaxial strain, up to a critical strain, after which
it falls off. In this work, we take an `instability' approach and seek for divergences in susceptibilities.
This provides an unbiased way to distinguish tendencies to competing ground states. We show that
in the unstrained compound the singlet and triplet instabilities of the normal Fermi liquid phase
are closely spaced. Under uniaxial strain electrons residing on all orbitals contributing to the
Fermiology become more coherent while the electrons of Ru-$d_{xy}$ character become heavier and
electrons of Ru-$d_{xz,yz}$ characters become lighter. In the process, Im\,$\chi(\mathbf{q},\omega)$
increases rapidly around the incommensurate vector $\mathbf{q}{=}(0.3,0.3,0)2\pi/a$ while
it gets suppressed at all other commensurate vectors, in particular at $q{=}0$, which is essential
for spin-triplet superconductivity. Thus the triplet superconducting instability remains the
lagging instability of the system and the singlet instability enhances under strain, leading to
a large energy-scale separation between these competing instabilities. At large strain an instability
to a spin density wave overtakes the superconducting one. The analysis relies on a high-fidelity,
\emph{ab initio} description of the one-particle properties and two-particle susceptibilities,
based on the Quasiparticle Self-Consistent \emph{GW} approximation augmented by Dynamical Mean
Field theory. This approach is described and its high fidelity confirmed by comparing to observed
one- and two-particle properties.

Solitonic magnetic excitations such as domain walls and, specifically, skyrmionics enable the
possibility of compact, high density, ultrafast,all-electronic, low-energy devices, which
is the basis for the emerging area of skyrmionics. The topological winding of skyrmion spins affects
their overall lifetime, energetics and dynamical behavior. In this review, we discuss skyrmionics
in the context of the present day solid state memory landscape, and show how their size, stability
and mobility can be controlled by material engineering, as well as how they can be nucleated and detected.
Ferrimagnetsnear their compensation points are important candidates for this application, leading
to detailed exploration of amorphous CoGd as well as the study of emergent materials such as Mn$_4$N
and Inverse Heusler alloys. Along with material properties, geometrical parameters such as film
thickness, defect density and notches can be used to tune skyrmion properties, such as their size
and stability. Topology, however, can be a double-edged sword, especially for isolated metastable
skyrmions, as it brings stability at the cost of additional damping and deflective Magnus forces
compared to domain walls. Skyrmion deformation in response to forces also makes them intrinsically
slower than domain walls. We explore potential analog applications of skyrmions, including temporal
memory at low density, and decorrelator for stochastic computing at a higher density that capitalizes
on their interactions. We summarize the main challenges to achieve a skyrmionics technology, including
maintaining positional stability with very high accuracy, electrical readout, especially for
small ferrimagnetic skyrmions, deterministic nucleation and annihilation, and overall integration
with digital circuits with the associated circuit overhead.

The information content of crystalline materials becomes astronomical when collective electronic
behavior and their fluctuations are taken into account. In the past decade, improvements in source
brightness and detector technology at modern x-ray facilities have allowed a dramatically increased
fraction of this information to be captured. Now, the primary challenge is to understand and discover
scientific principles from big data sets when a comprehensive analysis is beyond human reach. We
report the development of a novel unsupervised machine learning approach, XRD Temperature Clustering
(X-TEC), that can automatically extract charge density wave (CDW) order parameters and detect
intra-unit cell (IUC) ordering and its fluctuations from a series of high-volume X-ray diffraction
(XRD) measurements taken at multiple temperatures. We apply X-TEC to XRD data on a quasi-skutterudite
family of materials, (Ca$_x$Sr$_{1-x}$)$_3$Rh$_4$Sn$_{13}$, where a quantum critical point
arising from charge order is observed as a function of Ca concentration. We further apply X-TEC to
XRD data on the pyrochlore metal, Cd$_2$Re$_2$O$_7$, to investigate its two much debated structural
phase transitions and uncover the Goldstone mode accompanying them. We demonstrate how unprecedented
atomic scale knowledge can be gained when human researchers connect the X-TEC results to physical
principles. Specifically, we extract from the X-TEC-revealed selection rule that the Cd and Re
displacements are approximately equal in amplitude, but out of phase. This discovery reveals a
previously unknown involvement of $5d^2$ Re, supporting the idea of an electronic origin to the
structural order. Our approach can radically transform XRD experiments by allowing in-operando
data analysis and enabling researchers to refine experiments by discovering interesting regions
of phase space on-the-fly.

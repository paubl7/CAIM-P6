We study the relationship between topological defect formation and ground-state packings in a
model of repulsions in external confining potentials. Specifically we consider screened 2D Coulombic
repulsions, which conveniently parameterizes the effects of interaction range, but also serves
as simple physical model of confined, parallel arrays of polyelectrolyte filaments or vortices
in type-II superconductors. The countervailing tendencies of repulsions and confinement to,
respectively, spread and concentrate particle density leads to an energetic preference for non-uniform
densities in the clusters. Ground states in such systems have previously been modeled as {\it conformal
crystals}, which are composed of locally equitriangular packings whose local areal densities
exhibit long range gradients. Here, we assess two theoretical models that connect the preference
for non-uniform density to the formation of disclination defects, one of which assumes a continuum
distributions of defect, while the second considers the quantized and localized nature of disclinations
in hexagonal conformal crystals. Comparing both models to numerical simulations of discrete particles
clusters, we study the influence of interaction range and confining potential on defects in ground
states. We show that treating disclinations as continuously distributable well-captures the
number of topological defects in the ground state in the regime of long-range interactions, while
as interactions become shorter range, it dramatically overpredicts the to growth in total defect
charge. Analysis of the discretized defect theory suggests that limitations of the continuous
defect theory can be attributed to the asymmetry in the placement of positive vs. negative disclinations
in the conformal crystal ground states, as well as a strongly asymmetric dependence of self-energy
of disclinations on sign of topological charge.

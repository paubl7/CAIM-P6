Industrial and model polymer nanocomposites are often formulated with coating agents to improve
polymer-nanoparticle (NP) compatibility. Here the localization of silane coating agents in styrene-butadiene
nanocomposite is investigated through the segmental dynamics of the polymer matrix by broadband
dielectric spectroscopy (BDS), allowing the detection of silanes in the matrix through their plasticization
effect. This acceleration of dynamics was followed via the shift of $\tau$max of the $\alpha$-relaxation
induced by the presence of coating agents of different molecular weight and quantity, for different
amounts of incorporated colloidal silica NPs (R $\approx$ 12.5 nm, polydispersity 12%). Any noteworthy
contribution of interfacial polymer layers on $\tau$max has been excluded by reference measurements
with bare NPs. Our approach allowed quantifying the partition between the matrix and the NP interfaces,
and was confirmed independently by calorimetry. As a control parameter, the silane grafting reaction
could be activated or not, which was confirmed by the absence (resp. presence) of partitioning with
the matrix. Our main result is that in the first steps of material formulation, before any grafting
reaction, coating agents both cover the silica surface by adsorption and mix with the polymer matrix-in
particular if the latter has chemical compatibility via its functional groups. Silane adsorption
was found to be comparable to the grafted amount (1.1 nm-2), and does not increase further, confirming
that the plateau of the adsorption isotherm is reached in industrial formulations. These results
are hoped to contribute to a better understanding of the surface reactions taking place during complex
formulation processes of nanocomposites, namely the exact amounts at stake, e.g., in industrial
mixers. Final material properties are affected both through NP-matrix compatibility and plasticization
of the latter by unreacted molecules. 2

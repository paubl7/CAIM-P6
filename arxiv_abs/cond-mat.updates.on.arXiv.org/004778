A recent experiment has reported oscillations of the thermal conductivity of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$
driven by an in-plane magnetic field that are reminiscent of the quantum oscillations in metals.
At first glance, these observations are consistent with the presence of the long-sought-after
spinon Fermi surface state. Strikingly, however, the experiment also reported vanishing thermal
Hall conductivity coexisting with the oscillations of the longitudinal one. Such absence of the
thermal Hall effect must originate from crystalline symmetries of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$. But if the
system was a traditional spinon fermi surface state, these symmetries would also necessarily prohibit
the emergence of a magnetic field acting on the spinons, in stark contradiction with the presence
of quantum oscillations in experiments. To reconcile these observations, we introduce a new class
of symmetry enriched ``pseudoscalar" U(1) spin liquids in which certain crystalline symmetries
act as a particle-hole conjugation on the spinons. The associated pseudoscalar spinon Fermi surface
states allow for the coexistence of an emergent Landau quantizing magnetic field while having an
exactly zero thermal Hall conductivity. We develop a general theory of these states by constructing
Gutzwiller-projected wave-functions and describing how they naturally appear as U(1) spin liquids
with a distinctive projective symmetry group implementation of crystalline symmetries in the
fermionic parton representation of spins. We propose that the field induced quantum disordered
state in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ descends from a pseudoscalar spinon fermi surface state that features
compensated spinon-particle and spinon-hole pockets possibly located around the $M$ points of
its honeycomb Brillouin zone. These points are connected via a wave-vector associated with the
emergence of the competing zig-zag antiferromagnetic state.

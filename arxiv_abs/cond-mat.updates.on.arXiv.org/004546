Using a fast and accurate neural network potential we are able to systematically explore the energy
landscape of large unit cells of bulk magnesium oxide with the minima hopping method. The potential
is trained with a focus on the near-stoichiometric compositions, in particular on suboxides, i.e.,
Mg$_x$O$_{1-x}$ with $0.50<x<0.60$. Our extensive exploration demonstrates that for bulk stoichiometric
compounds, there are several new low-energy rocksalt-like structures in which Mg atoms are octahedrally
six--coordinated and form trigonal prismatic motifs with different stacking sequences. Furthermore,
we find a dense spectrum of novel non-stoichiometric crystal phases of Mg$_x$O$_{1-x}$ for each
composition of $x$. These structures are mostly similar to the rock salt structure with octahedral
coordination and five--coordinated Mg atoms. Due to the removal of one oxygen atom, the energy landscape
becomes more glass-like with oxygen-vacancy type structures that all lie very close to each other
energetically. For the same number of magnesium and oxygen atoms our oxygen-deficient structures
are lower in energy if the vacancies are aligned along lines or planes than rock salt structures with
randomly distributed oxygen vacancies. We also found the putative global minima configurations
for each composition of the non-stoichiometric suboxide structures. These structures are predominantly
composed of (111) slabs of the rock salt structure which are terminated with Mg atoms at the top and
bottom, and are stacked in different sequences along the $z$-direction. Like other Magn\'eli-type
phases, these structures have properties that differ considerably from their stoichiometric
counterparts such as low lattice thermal conductivity and high electrical conductivity.

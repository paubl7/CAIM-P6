Inspired by investigations of Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) produced in the Cold Atom Laboratory
(CAL) aboard the International Space Station, we present a study of thermodynamic properties of
shell-shaped BECs. Within the context of a spherically symmetric `bubble trap' potential, we study
the evolution of the system from small filled spheres to hollow, large, thin shells via the tuning
of trap parameters. We analyze the bubble trap spectrum and states, and track the distinct changes
in spectra between radial and angular modes across the evolution. This separation of the excitation
spectrum provides a basis for quantifying dimensional cross-over to quasi-2D physics at a given
temperature. Using the spectral data, for a range of trap parameters, we compute the critical temperature
for a fixed number of particles to form a BEC. For a set of initial temperatures, we also evaluate the
change in temperature that would occur in adiabatic expansion from small filled sphere to large
thin shell were the trap to be dynamically tuned. We show that the system cools during this expansion
but that the decrease in critical temperature occurs more rapidly, thus resulting in depletion
of any initial condensate. We contrast our spectral methods with standard semiclassical treatments,
which we find must be used with caution in the thin-shell limit. With regards to interactions, using
energetic considerations and corroborated through Bogoliubov treatments, we demonstrate that
they would be less important for thin shells due to reduced density but vortex physics would become
more predominant. Finally, we apply our treatments to traps that realistically model CAL experiments
and borrow from the thermodynamic insights found in the idealized bubble case during adiabatic
expansion.

Detailed calculations of the specific absorption rate (SAR) of a dilute assembly of iron oxide nanoparticles
with effective uniaxial anisotropy dispersed in a liquid are performed depending on the particle
diameters, the alternating (ac) magnetic field amplitude and the liquid viscosity. For small and
moderate ac magnetic field amplitudes H0 with respect to particle anisotropy field Hk the SAR of
the assembly as a function of the particle diameter passes through a characteristic maximum and
then reaches a plateau, whereas for sufficiently large amplitudes, H0 ~ Hk, the SAR increases monotonically
as a function of particle diameter. This difference is a consequence of realization of viscous and
magnetic oscillation modes for particle unit magnetization vector and director for moderate and
sufficiently large H0 values, respectively. It is found that the SAR of the assembly changes inversely
with the viscosity only in a viscous mode, for nanoparticles of sufficiently large diameters. In
the developed magnetic mode the SAR of the assembly is practically independent of the viscosity,
since in this case the nanoparticle director only weakly oscillates around the ac magnetic field
direction. At moderate amplitudes of the ac magnetic field the SAR values of the assembly in the liquid
and in the solid matrix are found to be close, except of the range of large particle diameters and sufficiently
low viscosity. However, at large field amplitudes the SAR of randomly oriented assembly of nanoparticles
in a solid matrix is approximately two times less than that in a liquid, because a significant fraction
of nanoparticles of the assembly in the solid matrix is not optimally oriented with respect to the
ac magnetic field direction. The conditions for the validity of the linear response theory have
been clarified by comparison with the numerical simulation data.

The standard model of spin-transfer torque (STT) in antiferromagnetic spintronics considers
exchange of angular momentum between quantum spins of flowing electrons and noncollinear-to-them
localized spins treated as classical vectors. These vectors are assumed to realize N\'{e}el order
in equilibrium, $\uparrow \downarrow \ldots \uparrow \downarrow$, and their STT-driven dynamics
is described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. However, many experimentally employed
materials (such as archetypal NiO) are strongly electron-correlated antiferromagnetic Mott
insulators (AFMI) where localized spins form a ground state quite different from the unentangled
N\'{e}el state $|\!\! \uparrow \downarrow \ldots \uparrow \downarrow \rangle$. The true ground
state is entangled by quantum spin fluctuations, leading to expectation value of all localized
spins being zero, so that LLG dynamics of classical vectors of fixed length rotating due to STT cannot
even be initiated. Instead, a fully quantum treatment of both conduction electrons and localized
spins is necessary to capture exchange of spin angular momentum between them, denoted as quantum
STT. We use a recently developed time-dependent density matrix renormalization group approach
to quantum STT to predict how injection of a spin-polarized current pulse into a normal metal layer
coupled to AFMI overlayer via exchange interaction and possibly small interlayer hopping -- which
mimics, e.g., topological-insulator/NiO bilayer employed experimentally -- will induce nonzero
expectation value of AFMI localized spins. This new nonequilibrium phase is a spatially inhomogeneous
ferromagnet with zigzag profile of localized spins. The total spin absorbed by AFMI increases with
electron-electron repulsion in AFMI, as well as when the two layers do not exchange any charge.

Combining dielectric crystals with mesoporous solids allows a versatile design of functional
nanomaterials, where the porous host provides a mechanical rigid scaffold structure and the molecular
filling adds the functionalization. Here, we report a study of the complex lattice dynamics of a
SiO$_2$:KH$_2$PO$_4$ nanocomposite consisting of a monolithic, mesoporous silica glass host
with KH$_2$PO$_4$ nanocrystals embedded in its tubular channels $\sim$12 nm across. A micro-Raman
investigation performed in the spectral range of 70-1600 cm$^{-1}$ reveals the complex lattice
dynamics of the confined crystals. Their Raman spectrum resembles the one taken from bulk KH$_2$PO$_4$
crystals and thus, along with X-ray diffraction experiments, corroborates the successful solution-based
synthesis of KH$_2$PO$_4$ nanocrystals with a structure analogous to the bulk material. We succeeded
in observing not only the high-frequency internal modes ($\sim$900-1200 cm$^{-1}$), typical
of internal vibrations of the PO$_4$ tetrahedra, but, more importantly, also the lowest frequency
modes typical of bulk KH$_2$PO$_4$ crystals. The experimental Raman spectrum was interpreted
with a group theory analysis and first-principle lattice dynamics calculations. The analysis
of calculated eigen-vectors indicates the involvement of hydrogen atoms in most phonon modes corroborating
the substantial significance of the hydrogen subsystem in the lattice dynamics of paraelectric
bulk and of KH$_2$PO$_4$ crystals in extreme spatial confinement. A marginal redistribution of
relative Raman intensities of the confined compared to unconfined crystals presumably originates
in slightly changed crystal fields and interatomic interactions, in particular for the parts of
the nanocrystals in close proximity to the silica pore surfaces.

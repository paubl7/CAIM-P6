We study the chase-escape percolation model on the 2D square lattice. In this model, prey particles
spread to neighboring empty sites at rate $p$, and predator particles spread only to neighboring
sites occupied by prey particles at rate $1$, killing the prey particle present at that site. It is
found that prey can survive for $p>p_c$ with $p_c<1$. We estimate the value of $p_c$ to be $0.4943
\pm 0.0005$ and the critical exponent for the divergence of the correlation length $\nu$ to be consistent
with the 2D isotropic percolation value $4/3$. We further show Chase-Escape percolation cannot
fully be in the 2D isotropic percolation universality class as for $p<p_c$ on a $D-$dimensional
hypercubical lattice, the probability that the number of predators in the absorbing configuration
is greater than $s$ is bounded from below by $\exp(-Kp^{-1}s^{1/d})$, where $K$ is some $p$-independent
constant, in contrast to the exponentially decaying cluster size distribution of isotropic percolation.
We then study the problem starting from an initial condition with predator particles on all lattice
points of the line $y=0$ and prey particles on the line $y=1$. In this case, for $p_c<p<1$, the center
of mass of the prey and predator fronts travel at the same speed and the two fronts fluctuate, but remain
close to each other. We find that the speed of the pinned Chase-Escape front is strictly smaller than
the speed of the Eden front when its spreading rate is equal to $p$ and show that it is caused by the prey
sites at the leading edge being eaten up by the predator. We study the depinning transition between
the two fronts in the model at $p=1$. At the depinning point, on a line of length $L$, the variance of
the width of red front increases as $L^{\alpha}f(t/L^z)$ where $f$ a scaling function with $\alpha\approx
1$ and $z=1.67\pm 0.1$.

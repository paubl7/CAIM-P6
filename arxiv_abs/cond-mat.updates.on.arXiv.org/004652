We derive a series of quantitative bulk-boundary correspondences for 3D bosonic and fermionic
symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases under the assumption that the surface is gapped,
symmetric and topologically ordered, i.e., a symmetry-enriched topological (SET) state. We consider
those SPT phases that are protected by the mirror symmetry and continuous symmetries that form a
group of $U(1)$, $SU(2)$ or $SO(3)$. In particular, the fermionic cases correspond to a crystalline
version of 3D topological insulators and topological superconductors in the famous ten-fold-way
classification, with the time-reversal symmetry replaced by the mirror symmetry and with strong
interaction taken into account. For surface SETs, the most general interplay between symmetries
and anyon excitations is considered. Based on the previously proposed dimension reduction and
folding approaches, we re-derive the classification of bulk SPT phases and define a \emph{complete}
set of bulk topological invariants for every symmetry group under consideration, and then derive
explicit expressions of the bulk invariants in terms of surface topological properties (such as
topological spin, quantum dimension) and symmetry properties (such as mirror fractionalization,
fractional charge or spin). These expressions are our quantitative bulk-boundary correspondences.
Meanwhile, the bulk topological invariants can be interpreted as \emph{anomaly indicators} for
the surface SETs which carry 't Hooft anomalies of the associated symmetries whenever the bulk is
topologically non-trivial. Hence, the quantitative bulk-boundary correspondences provide
an easy way to compute the 't Hooft anomalies of the surface SETs. Moreover, our anomaly indicators
are complete. Our derivations of the bulk-boundary correspondences and anomaly indicators are
explicit and physically transparent.

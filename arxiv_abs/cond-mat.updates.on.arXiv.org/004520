Quantum spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg trimerized chain with strong intradimer and weak
monomer-dimer coupling constants is studied using the novel many-body perturbation expansion,
which is developed from the exactly solved spin-1/2 Ising-Heisenberg diamond chain preserving
correlations between all interacting spins of the trimerized chain unlike the standard perturbation
scheme developed on the grounds of noninteracting spin monomers and dimers. The Heisenberg trimerized
chain shows the intermediate one-third plateau, which was also observed in the magnetization curve
of the polymeric compound Cu$_3$(P$_2$O$_6$OH)$_2$ affording its experimental realization.
Within the modified strong-coupling method we have obtained the effective Hamiltonians for the
magnetic-field range from zero to one-third plateau, and from one-third plateau to the saturation
magnetization. The second-order perturbation theory shows reliable results even for the moderate
ratio between weaker dimer-monomer and stronger intradimer coupling constants. We have also examined
thermodynamic properties and recovered the low-temperature peak in the specific heat. The accuracy
of the developed method is tested through a comparison with numerical density-matrix renormalization
group and quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Using the results for the effective Hamiltonian we suggest
straightforward procedure for finding the microscopic parameters of one-dimensional trimerized
magnetic compounds with strong intradimer and weak monomer-dimer couplings. We found the refined
values for the coupling constants of Cu$_3$(P$_2$O$_6$OH)$_2$ by matching the theoretical results
with the available experimental data for the magnetization and magnetic susceptibility in a wide
range of temperatures and magnetic fields.

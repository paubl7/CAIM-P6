Van der Waals heterostructures display a rich variety of unique electronic properties. To identify
novel transport mechanisms, nonlocal measurements have been widely used, wherein a voltage is
measured at contacts placed far away from the expected classical flow of charge carriers. This approach
was employed in search of dissipationless spin and valley transport, topological charge-neutral
currents, hydrodynamic flows and helical edge modes. Monolayer, bilayer, and few-layer graphene,
transition-metal dichalcogenides, and moire superlattices were found to display pronounced
nonlocal effects. However, the origin of these effects is hotly debated. Graphene, in particular,
exhibits giant nonlocality at charge neutrality, a prominent behavior that attracted competing
explanations. Utilizing superconducting quantum interference device on a tip (SQUID-on-tip)
for nanoscale thermal and scanning gate imaging, we demonstrate that the commonly-occurring charge
accumulation at graphene edges leads to giant nonlocality, producing narrow conductive channels
that support long-range currents. Unexpectedly, while the edge conductance has little impact
on the current flow in zero magnetic field, it leads to field-induced decoupling between edge and
bulk transport at moderate fields. The resulting giant nonlocality both at charge neutrality and
away from it produces exotic flow patterns in which charges can flow against the global electric
field. We have visualized surprisingly intricate patterns of nonlocal currents, which are sensitive
to edge disorder. The observed one-dimensional edge transport, being generic and nontopological,
is expected to support nonlocal transport in many electronic systems, offering insight into numerous
controversies in the literature and linking them to long-range guided electronic states at system
edges.

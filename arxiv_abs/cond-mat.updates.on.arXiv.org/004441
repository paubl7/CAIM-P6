An exact integral formula for the Kirkwood correlation factor of isotropic polar fluids $g_K$ is
derived from the equilibrium averaged rotational Dean equation, which as compared to previous
approaches easily lends itself to further approximations. The static linear permittivity of polar
fluids $\epsilon$ is calculated as a function of temperature, density and molecular dipole moment
in vacuo for arbitrary pair interaction potentials. Then, using the Kirkwood superposition approximation
for the three-body orientational distribution function, we suggest a simple way to construct model
potentials of mean torques considering permanent and induced dipole moments. We successfully
compare the theory with the experimental temperature dependence of the static linear permittivity
of various polar fluids such as a series of linear monohydroxy alcohols, water, tributyl phosphate,
acetonitrile, acetone, nitrobenzene and dimethyl sulfoxide, by fitting only one single parameter,
which describes the induction to dipole-dipole energy strength ratio. We demonstrate that comparing
the value of $g_K$ with unity in order to deduce the alignment state of permanent dipole pairs, as
is currently done is in many situations, is a misleading oversimplification, while the correct
alignment state is revealed when considering the proper interaction potential. Moreover we show,
that picturing H-bonding polar fluids as polar molecules with permanent and induced dipole moments
without invoking any specific H-bonding mechanism is in many cases sufficient to explain experimental
data of the static dielectric constant. In this light, the failure of the theory to describe the experimental
temperature dependence of the static dielectric constant of glycerol, a non-rigid polyalcohol,
is not due to the lack of specific H-bonding mechanisms, but rather to an oversimplified model potential
for that particular molecule.

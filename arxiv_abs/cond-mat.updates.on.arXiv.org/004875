Through CaH2 chemical reduction of a parent R3+Ni3+O3 perovskite form, superconductivity was
recently achieved in Sr-doped NdNiO2 on SrTiO3 substrate. Using density functional theory (DFT)
calculations, we find that stoichiometric NdNiO2 is significantly unstable with respect to decomposition
into 1/2[Nd2O3 + NiO + Ni] with exothermic decomposition energy of +176 meV/atom, a considerably
higher instability than that for common ternary oxides. This poses the question if the stoichiometric
NdNiO2 nickelate compound used extensively to model the electronic band structure of Ni-based
oxide analog to cuprates and found to be metallic is the right model for this purpose. To examine this,
we study via DFT the role of the common H impurity expected to be present in the process of chemical
reduction needed to obtain NdNiO2. We find that H can be incorporated exothermically, i.e., spontaneously
in NdNiO2, even from H2 gas. In the concentrated limit, such impurities can result in the formation
of a hydride compound NdNiO2H, which has significantly reduced instability relative to hydrogen-free
NdNiO2. Interestingly, the hydrogenated form has a similar lattice constant as the pure form (leading
to comparable XRD patterns), but unlike the metallic character of NdNiO2, the hydrogenated form
is predicted to be a wide gap insulator thus, requiring doping to create a metallic or superconducting
state, just like cuprates, but unlike unhydrogenated nickelates. While it is possible that hydrogen
would be eventually desorbed, the calculation suggests that pristine NdNiO2 is hydrogen-stabilized.
One must exercise caution with theories predicting new physics in pristine stoichiometric NdNiO2
as it might be an unrealizable compound. Experimental examination of the composition of real NdNiO2
superconductors and the effect of hydrogen on the superconductivity is called for.

Classical scaling relationships for rheological quantities such as the $\mu(J)$-rheology have
become increasingly popular for closures of two-phase flow modeling. However, these frameworks
have been derived for monodisperse particles. We aim to extend these considerations to sediment
transport modeling by using a more realistic sediment composition. We investigate the rheological
behavior of sheared sediment beds composed of polydisperse spherical particles in a laminar Couette-type
shear flow. The sediment beds consist of particles with a diameter size ratio of up to ten, which corresponds
to grains ranging from fine to coarse sand. The data was generated using fully coupled, grain resolved
direct numerical simulations using a combined lattice Boltzmann - discrete element method. These
highly-resolved data yield detailed depth-resolved profiles of the relevant physical quantities
that determine the rheology, i.e., the local shear rate of the fluid, particle volume fraction,
total shear, and granular pressure. A comparison against experimental data shows excellent agreement
for the monodisperse case. We improve upon the parameterization of the $\mu(J)$-rheology by expressing
its empirically derived parameters as a function of the maximum particle volume fraction. Furthermore,
we extend these considerations by exploring the creeping regime for viscous numbers much lower
than used by previous studies to calibrate these correlations. Considering the low viscous numbers
of our data, we found that the friction coefficient governing the quasi-static state in the creeping
regime tends to a finite value for vanishing shear, which decreases the critical friction coefficient
by a factor of three for all cases investigated.

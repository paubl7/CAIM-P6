We report the crystal structures and magnetic properties of two psuedo-polymorphs of the $S=1/2$
Ti$^{3+}$ coordination framework, KTi(C$_2$O$_4$)$_2\cdot$xH$_2$O. Single-crystal X-ray
and powder neutron diffraction measurements on $\alpha$-KTi(C$_2$O$_4$)$_2\cdot$xH$_2$O
confirm its structure in the tetragonal $I4/mcm$ space group with a square planar arrangement of
Ti$^{3+}$ ions. Magnetometry and specific heat measurements reveal weak antiferromagnetic interactions,
with $J_1\approx7$ K and $J_2/J_1=0.11$ indicating a slight frustration of nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor
interactions. Below $1.8$ K, $\alpha$ undergoes a transition to G-type antiferromagnetic order
with magnetic moments aligned along the $c$ axis of the tetragonal structure. The estimated ordered
moment of Ti$^{3+}$ in $\alpha$ is suppressed from its spin-only value to $0.62(3)~\mu_B$, thus
verifying the two-dimensional nature of the magnetic interactions within the system. $\beta$-KTi(C$_2$O$_4$)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O,
on the other hand, realises a three-dimensional diamond-like magnetic network of Ti$^{3+}$ moments
within a hexagonal $P6_222$ structure. An antiferromagnetic exchange coupling of $J\approx54$
K -- an order of magnitude larger than in $\alpha$ -- is extracted from magnetometry and specific
heat data. $\beta$ undergoes N\'eel ordering at $T_N=28$ K, with the magnetic moments aligned within
the $ab$ plane and a slightly reduced ordered moment of $0.79~\mu_B$ per Ti$^{3+}$. Through density-functional
theory calculations, we address the origin of the large difference in the exchange parameters between
the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ psuedo-polymorphs. Given their observed magnetic behaviors, we propose
$\alpha$-KTi(C$_2$O$_4$)$_2\cdot$xH$_2$O and $\beta$-KTi(C$_2$O$_4$)$_2\cdot$2H$_2$O
as close to ideal model $S=1/2$ Heisenberg square and diamond lattice antiferromagnets, respectively.

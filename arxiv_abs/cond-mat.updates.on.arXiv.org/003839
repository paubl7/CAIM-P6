The continuum dislocation dynamics framework for mesoscale plasticity is intended to capture
the dislocation density evolution and the deformation of crystals when subjected to mechanical
loading. It does so by solving a set of transport equations for dislocations concurrently with crystal
mechanics equations, with the latter being cast in the form of an eigenstrain problem. Incorporating
dislocation reactions in the dislocation transport equations is essential for making such continuum
dislocation dynamics predictive. A formulation is proposed to incorporate dislocation reactions
in the transport equations of the vector density-based continuum dislocation dynamics. This formulation
aims to rigorously enforce dislocation line continuity using the concept of virtual dislocations
that close all dislocation loops involved in cross slip, annihilation, and glissile and sessile
junction reactions. The addition of virtual dislocations enables us to accurately enforce the
divergence free condition upon the numerical solution of the dislocation transport equations
for all slip systems individually. A set of tests were performed to illustrate the accuracy of the
formulation and the solution of the transport equations within the vector density-based continuum
dislocation dynamics. Comparing the results from these tests with an earlier approach in which
the divergence free constraint was enforced on the total dislocation density tensor or the sum of
two densities when only cross slip is considered shows that the new approach yields highly accurate
results. Bulk simulations were performed for a face centered cubic crystal based on the new formulation
and the results were compared with discrete dislocation dynamics predictions of the same. The microstructural
features obtained from continuum dislocation dynamics were also analyzed with reference to relevant
experimental observations.

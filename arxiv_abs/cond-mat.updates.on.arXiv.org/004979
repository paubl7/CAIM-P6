It is well-known that the degeneracy of two-phase microstructures with the same volume fraction
and two-point correlation function $S_2(\mathbf{r})$ is generally infinite. To elucidate the
degeneracy problem explicitly, we examine Debye random media, which are entirely defined by a purely
exponentially decaying two-point correlation function $S_2(r)$. In this work, we consider three
different classes of Debye random media. First, we generate the "most probable" class using the
Yeong-Torquato construction algorithm. A second class of Debye random media is obtained by demonstrating
that the corresponding two-point correlation functions are effectively realized in the first
three space dimensions by certain models of overlapping, polydisperse spheres. A third class is
obtained by using the Yeong-Torquato algorithm to construct Debye random media that are constrained
to have an unusual prescribed pore-size probability density function. We structurally discriminate
these three classes of Debye random media from one another by ascertaining their other statistical
descriptors, including the pore-size, surface correlation, chord-length probability density,
and lineal-path functions. We also compare and contrast the percolation thresholds as well as the
diffusion and fluid transport properties of these degenerate Debye random media. We find that these
three classes of Debye random media are generally distinguished by the aforementioned descriptors
and their microstructures are also visually distinct from one another. Our work further confirms
the well-known fact that scattering information is insufficient to determine the effective physical
properties of two-phase media. Additionally, our findings demonstrate the importance of the other
two-point descriptors considered here in the design of materials with a spectrum of physical properties.

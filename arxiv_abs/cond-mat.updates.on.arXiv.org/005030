The elementary CuO2 plane sustaining cuprate high-temperature superconductivity occurs typically
at the base of a periodic array of edge-sharing CuO5 pyramids (Fig 1a). Virtual transitions of electrons
between adjacent planar Cu and O atoms, occurring at a rate $t/{\hbar}$ and across the charge-transfer
energy gap E, generate 'superexchange' spin-spin interactions of energy $J\approx4t^4/E^3$
in an antiferromagnetic correlated-insulator state1. Hole doping the CuO2 plane disrupts this
magnetic order while perhaps retaining superexchange interactions, thus motivating a hypothesis
of spin-singlet electron-pair formation at energy scale J as the mechanism of high-temperature
superconductivity. Although the response of the superconductor's electron-pair wavefunction
$\Psi\equiv<c_\uparrow c_\downarrow>$ to alterations in E should provide a direct test of such
hypotheses, measurements have proven impracticable. Focus has turned instead to the distance
${\delta}$ between each Cu atom and the O atom at the apex of its CuO5 pyramid. Varying ${\delta}$
should alter the Coulomb potential at the planar Cu and O atoms, modifying E and thus J, and thereby
controlling ${\Psi}$ in a predictable manner. Here we implement atomic-scale imaging of E and ${\Psi}$,
both as a function of the periodic modulation in ${\delta}$ that occurs naturally in $Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}$.
We demonstrate that the responses of E and ${\Psi}$ to varying ${\delta}$, and crucially those of
${\Psi}$ to the varying E, conform to theoretical predictions. These data provide direct atomic-scale
verification that charge-transfer superexchange is key to the electron-pairing mechanism in
the hole-doped cuprate superconductor ${Bi_2Sr_2CaCu_2O_{8+x}}$.

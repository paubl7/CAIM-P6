The ultrafast polarization response to incident light and ensuing exciton/carrier generation
are essential to outstanding optoelectronic properties of lead halide perovskites (LHPs). A large
number of mechanistic studies in the LHP field to date have focused on contributions to polarizability
from organic cations and the highly polarizable inorganic lattice. For a comprehensive understanding
of the ultrafast polarization response, we must additionally account for the nearly instantaneous
hyperpolarizability response to the propagating light field itself. While light propagation
is pivotal to optoelectronics and photonics, little is known about this in LHPs in the vicinity of
the bandgap where stimulated emission, polariton condensation, superfluorescence, and photon
recycling may take place. Here we develop two-dimensional optical Kerr effect (2D-OKE) spectroscopy
to energetically dissect broadband light propagation and dispersive nonlinear polarization
responses in LHPs. In contrast to earlier interpretations, the below-bandgap OKE responses in
both hybrid CH3NH3PbBr3 and all-inorganic CsPbBr3 perovskites are found to originate from strong
hyperpolarizability and highly anisotropic dispersions. In both materials, the nonlinear mixing
of anisotropically propagating light fields result in convoluted oscillatory polarization dynamics.
Based on a four-wave mixing model, we quantitatively derive dispersion anisotropies, reproduce
2D-OKE frequency correlations, and establish polarization dressed light propagation in single
crystal LHPs. Moreover, our findings highlight the importance of distinguishing the often-neglected
anisotropic light propagation from underlying coherent quasi-particle responses in various
forms of ultrafast spectroscopy.

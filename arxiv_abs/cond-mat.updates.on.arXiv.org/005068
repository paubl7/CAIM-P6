Liquids realize a highly complex state of matter in which strong competing kinetic and interaction
effects come to life. As such, liquids are, generally, more challenging to understand than either
gases or solids. In weakly interacting gases, the kinetic effects dominate. By contrast, low temperature
solids typically feature far smaller fluctuations about their ground state. Notwithstanding
their complexity, with the exception of quantum fluids (e.g., superfluid Helium) and supercooled
liquids (including glasses), various aspects of common liquid dynamics such as their dynamic viscosity
are often assumed to be given by rather simple, Arrhenius-type, activated forms with nearly constant
(i.e., temperature independent) energy barriers. In this work, we analyze experimentally measured
viscosities of numerous liquids far above their equilibrium melting temperature to see how well
this assumption fares. We find marked deviations from simple activated dynamics. Even far above
their equilibrium melting temperatures, as the temperature drops, the viscosity of these liquids
increases more strongly than predicted by activated dynamics dominated by a single uniform energy
barrier. For metallic fluids, the scale of the prefactor in the Arrhenius form for the viscosity
is consistent with that given by the product $nh$ with $n$ the number density and $h$ Planck's constant.
More generally, in all fluids (whether metallic or non-metallic), $nh$ constitutes a lower bound
on the viscosity. We find that a scaling of the temperature axis (complementing that of the viscosity)
leads to a partial collapse of the temperature dependent viscosities of different fluids; such
a scaling allows for a functional dependence of the viscosity on temperature that includes yet is
far more general than activated Arrhenius form alone. We speculate on relations between non-Arrhenius
dynamics and thermodynamic observables.

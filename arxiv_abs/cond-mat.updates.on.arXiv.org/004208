Contact freezing is a mode of atmospheric ice nucleation in which a collision between a dry ice nucleating
particle (INP) and a water droplet results in considerably faster heterogeneous nucleation. The
molecular mechanism of such enhancement is, however, still a mystery. While earlier studies had
attributed it to collision-induced transient perturbations, recent experiments point to the
pivotal role of nanoscale proximity of the INP and the free interface. By simulating heterogeneous
nucleation of ice within INP-supported nanofilms of two model water-like tetrahedral liquids,
we demonstrate that such nanoscale proximity is sufficient for inducing rate increases commensurate
with those observed in contact freezing experiments, but only if the free interface has a tendency
to enhance homogeneous nucleation. Water is suspected of possessing this latter property, known
as surface freezing propensity. Our findings therefore establish a connection between surface
freezing propensity and kinetic enhancement during contact nucleation. We also observe that faster
nucleation proceeds through a mechanism markedly distinct from classical heterogeneous nucleation,
involving the formation of hourglass-shaped crystalline nuclei that conceive at either interface,
and that have a lower free energy of formation due to the nanoscale proximity of the interfaces and
the modulation of the free interfacial structure by the INP. In addition to providing valuable insights
into the physics of contact nucleation, our findings can assist in improving the accuracy of heterogeneous
nucleation rate measurements in experiments, and in advancing our understanding of ice nucleation
on nonuniform surfaces such as organic, polymeric and biological materials.

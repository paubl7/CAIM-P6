Conductance signatures that signal the presence of Majorana zero modes in a three terminal nanowire-topological
superconductor hybrid system are analyzed in detail, in both the clean nanowire limit and in the
presence of non-coherent dephasing interactions with fluctuating impurities. In the coherent
transport regime for a clean wire, we point out contributions of the local Andreev reflection and
the non-local transmissions toward the total conductance lineshape clarifying the role of contact
broadening on the Majorana conductance lineshapes at the magnetic field parity crossings. Interestingly,
at larger $B$-field parity crossings, the contribution of the Andreev reflection process decreases
which is compensated by the non-local processes in order to maintain the conductance quantum regardless
of contact coupling strength. In the non-coherent transport regime, we include dephasing that
is introduced by momentum randomization processes, that allows one to smoothly transition to the
diffusive limit. Here, as expected, we note that while the Majorana character of the zero modes is
unchanged, there is a reduction in the conductance peak magnitude that scales with the strength
of the impurity scattering potentials. Important distinctions between the effect of non-coherent
dephasing processes and contact-induced tunnel broadenings in the coherent regime on the conductance
lineshapes are elucidated. Most importantly our results reveal that the addition of dephasing
in the set up the does not lead to any notable length dependence to the conductance of the zero modes,
contrary to what one would expect in a gradual transition to the diffusive limit. This work thus paves
the way for systematic introduction of scattering processes into the realistic modeling of Majorana
nanowire hybrid devices and assessing topological signatures in such systems in the presence of
scattering processes.

Ba{[Gax,Tax]Ti(1-2x)}O3 ceramics with x equal to 0, 0.0025, 0.005, 0.01, 0.025 and 0.05 have been
prepared by conventional solid-state reaction. Structural and dielectric characterization
have been performed to investigate the effect of dipole-pair substitution concentration on the
macroscopic dielectric properties. Ba{[Gax,Tax]Ti(1-2x)}O3 evolves from a classic ferroelectric
to a diffuse phase transition (DPT) as x increases. Ba{[Gax,Tax]Ti(1-2x)}O3 for x > or = 0.01 possesses
diffuseness parameters comparable to Pb(Mg1/3Nb2/3)O3-PbTiO3 (PMN-PT) and recently reported
(Ba0.97Pr0.03)(Ti0.9425Ce0.05)O3 (BPTC), yet it lacks the frequency and temperature dependence
of Tm necessary to be a strictly defined relaxor ferroelectric. Additionally, Ba{[Ga0.05,Ta0.05]Ti0.9}O3
possesses a relative permittivity, {\epsilon}r, of 700+/-16% and dissipation factor less than
0.05 at 10 kHz within the temperature range [-75{\deg}C, 120{\deg}C]. In comparison to BaTiO3,
Ba{[Gax,Tax]Ti(1-2x)}O3 possesses enhanced electrical resistivity at and above room temperature.
In-situ XRD, including Rietveld refinement, have been performed to determine the lattice parameter,
coefficient of thermal expansion and phase transition temperature (Tc) of each composition within
the temperature range [RT, 1000{\deg}C], thus linking the dielectric properties with the materials
structure. These studies have been corroborated by temperature dependent Raman spectroscopy
to compare the Tc determined by electrical and structural characterization. The properties of
Ba{[Gax,Tax]Ti(1-2x)}O3 are discussed in context with available models that describe donor and
acceptor dopants spatially separated in the parent matrix, inter-relating lattice parameter,
Curie temperature, and other material properties

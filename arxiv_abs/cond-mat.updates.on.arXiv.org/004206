The characteristic microstructure of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)$_z$ alloys with SmCo$_5$ cell walls in
Sm$_2$Co$_{17}$ cells, all intersected by Zr-rich platelets, makes them some of the best performing
high-temperature permanent magnets. Plentiful research has been performed to tailor the microstructure
at the nanoscale, but due to its complexity many questions remain unanswered about the effect of
the individual phases on the magnetic performance at different temperatures. Here, we explore
this mechanism effect for three different Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)$_z$ alloys by deploying high-resolution
magnetic imaging via in-situ transmission electron microscopy and three-dimensional chemical
analysis using atom probe tomography. We show that their microstructures differ in terms of SmCo$_5$
cell-wall and Z-phase size and density, as well as the Cu concentration in the cell walls, and demonstrate
how these features influence the magnetic domain size and density and thus form different magnetic
textures. Moreover, we illustrate that the dominant coercivity mechanism at room temperature
is domain-wall pinning and show that magnets with a denser cell-wall network, a steeper Cu gradient
across the cell-wall boundary, and thinner Z-phase platelets have a higher coercivity. We also
show that the coercivity mechanism at high temperatures is domain-wall nucleation at the cell walls.
Increasing the Cu concentration inside the cell walls decreases the transition temperature between
pinning and nucleation, significantly decreasing the coercivity with increasing temperature.
We therefore provide a detailed explanation of how the microstructure on the atomic to nanoscale
directly affects the magnetic performance and provide detailed guidelines for an improved design
of Sm(Co,Fe,Cu,Zr)$_z$ magnets.

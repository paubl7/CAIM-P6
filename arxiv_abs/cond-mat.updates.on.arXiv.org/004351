The structural-magnetic models of 25 AFM kagome cuprates similar to herbertsmithite (ZnCu3(OH)6Cl2)
- a perspective spin liquid - have been calculated and analyzed. Main correlations between the structure
and magnetic properties of these compounds were revealed. It has been demonstrated that, in all
AFM kagome cuprates, including herbertsmithite, there exists the competition between the exchange
interaction and the antisymmetric anisotropic exchange one (the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction),
as magnetic ions are not linked to the center of inversion in the kagome lattice. This competition
is strengthened in all the kagome AFM, except herbertsmithite, by one more type of the anisotropy
(duality) of the third in length J3 magnetic couplings (strong J3(J12) next-to-nearest-neighbor
couplings in linear chains along the triangle edges and very weak FM or AFM J3(Jd) couplings along
the hexagon diagonals). The above couplings are crystallographically identical, but are divided
to two types of different in strength magnetic interactions. The existence of duality of J3 couplings
originated from the structure of the kagome lattice itself. Only combined contributions of dual
J3 couplings with anisotropic DM interactions are capable to suppress frustration of kagome AFM.
It has been demonstrated that the possibility of elimination of such a duality in herbertsmithite,
which made it a spin liquid, constitutes a rare lucky event in the kagome system. Three crystal chemistry
criteria of the existence of spin liquids on the kagome lattice have been identified: first, the
presence of frustrated kagome lattices with strong dominant antiferromagnetic nearest-neighbor
J1 couplings competing only with each other in small triangles; second, magnetic isolation of these
frustrated kagome lattices; and third, the absence of duality of the third in length J3 magnetic
couplings.

Using first-principle calculations and kinetic Monte Carlo simulation, we study the local and
averaged hysteresis in tiny clusters of k magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) or k-mers. We also analyze
the variation of local dipolar field acting on the constituent nanoparticles as a function of the
external magnetic field. The dipolar interaction is found to promote chain-like arrangement in
such a cluster. Irrespective of cluster size, the local hysteresis response depends strongly on
the corresponding dipolar field acted on a nanoparticle. In a small k-mer, there is a wide variation
in local hysteresis as a function of nanoparticle position. On the other hand, the local hysteresis
is more uniform for larger k-mer, except for MNPs at the boundary. In the case of superparamagnetic
nanoparticle and weak dipolar interaction, the local hysteresis loop area Ai is minimal and depends
weakly on the k-mer size. While for ferromagnetic counterpart, Ai is considerably large even for
weakly interacting MNPs. The value of Ai is found to be directly proportional to the dipolar field
acting on the nanoparticle. The dipolar interaction and k-mer size also enhances the coercivity
and remanence. There is always an increase in Ai with clutser size and dipolar interaction strength.
Similarly, the averaged hysteresis loop area A also depends strongly on the k-mer size, particle
size and dipolar interaction strength. A and Ai always increase with k-mer size and dipolar interaction
strength. Interestingly, the value of A saturates for k>=20 and considerable dipolar interaction
irrespective of particle size. We believe that the present work would help understand the intricate
role of dipolar interaction on hysteresis and organizational structure of MNPs and their usage
in drug delivery and hyperthermia applications.

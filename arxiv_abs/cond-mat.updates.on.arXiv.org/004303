Crystallographic symmetries enforcing band touchings (BTs) in the Brillouin zone (BZ) have been
utilized to classify and predict the topological semimetals. Though the early proposed topological
semimetals contain isolated nodal points in the BZ, the proposed nodal line semimetals later could
host various structures of several nodal lines/loops: nodal chains, nodal nets or Hopf-links,
etc. In this work, using compatibility relations, we first list all possible high symmetry lines
(HSLs) that can be nodal lines itself, high symmetry planes (HSPLs) that can host nodal loops, high
symmetry planes (HSPLs) that are nodal surfaces for all 230 SGs, with spin-orbit coupling and time-reversal
symmetry considered or not. We then show how to diagnose a nodal loop from the band crossing in an HSL,
or nodal line/surface from irreducible representation (irrep) of an high-symmetry point (HSP),
while the rest cases correspond to nodal points. Among our results, those essential cases, for which
the nodal points/lines/loops/surfaces must exist, are highlighted since they are promising for
the realizations of (nearly) ideal nodal point/line/loop/surface semimetals, as well as systems
with flexible tunability owning fixed structure of topological nodal points/lines/loops/surfaces.
Based on our results, SGs allowing Hopf-link structure with one straight nodal line threading a
nodal loop, or two nesting nodal loops lying in two respective high symmetry planes, are highlighted,
with the predicted materials being B$_5$Pb$_2$IO$_9$ in SG 34 and SrAl$_2$Au$_3$ in SG 62, respectively.
Our exhaustive results could serve as a useful guide for efficiently predicting and designing materials
or artificial systems owning exotic geometric nodal structures of energy bands simply based on
structure symmetries.

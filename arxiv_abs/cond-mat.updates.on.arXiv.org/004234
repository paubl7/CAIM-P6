A thorough understanding of the microscopic picture of heat conduction in solids is critical to
a broad range of applications, from thermal management of microelectronics to more efficient thermoelectric
materials. The transport properties of phonons, the major microscopic heat carriers in semiconductors
and insulators, particularly their scattering mechanisms, have been a central theme in microscale
heat conduction research. In the past two decades, significant advancements have been made in computational
and experimental efforts to probe phonon-phonon, phonon-impurity, and phonon-boundary scattering
channels in detail. In contrast, electron-phonon scatterings were long thought to have negligible
effects on thermal transport in most materials under ambient conditions. This article reviews
the recent progress in first-principles computations and experimental methods that show clear
evidence for a strong impact of electron-phonon interaction on phonon transport in a wide variety
of technologically relevant solid-state materials. Under thermal equilibrium conditions, electron-phonon
interactions can modify the total phonon scattering rates and renormalize the phonon frequency,
as determined by the imaginary part and the real part of the phonon self-energy, respectively. Under
nonequilibrium transport conditions, electron-phonon interactions can affect the coupled transport
of electrons and phonons in the bulk through the "phonon or electron drag" mechanism as well as the
interfacial thermal transport. Based on these recent results, we evaluate the potential use of
electron-phonon interactions to control thermal transport in solids. We also provide an outlook
on future directions of computational and experimental developments.

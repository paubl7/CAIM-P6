The quest for efficient and economically accessible cleaner methods to develop sustainable carbon-free
energy sources induced a keen interest in the production of hydrogen fuel. This can be achieved via
the water-splitting process exploiting solar energy but requiring the use of adequate photocatalysts.
Covalent triazine-based frameworks (CTFs) are target photocatalysts for water-splitting. Both
electronic and structural characteristics of CTFs, optical bandgaps and porosity, are directly
relevant for water-splitting. These can be engineered through chemical design. Porosity can be
beneficial to water-splitting by providing larger surface area for the catalytic reactions. However,
porosity can also affect both charge transport within the photocatalyst and mass transfer of both
reactants and products, thus impacting the overall kinetics of the reaction. We focus on the link
between chemical design and water (reactants) mass transfer, playing a key role in the water uptake
process and the subsequent hydrogen generation. We use neutron spectroscopy to study water mass
transfer in two porous CTFs, CTF-CN and CTF-2, that differ in the polarity of their struts. Quasi-elastic
neutron scattering (QENS) is used to quantify the amount of bound water and the translational diffusion
of water. Inelastic neutron scattering measurements complement QENS and provides insights into
the softness of the CTF structures and the changes in librational degrees of freedom of water in CTFs.
We show that CTF-CN exhibits smaller surface area and water uptake due to a softer structure than
CTF-2. The current study leads to new insights into the structure-dynamics-property relationship
of CTF photo-catalysts that pave the road for a better understanding of the guest-host interaction
at the basis of water splitting applications.

We present a numerical study on the intraband optical conductivity of hot carriers at quasiequilibria
in photoexcited graphene based on the semiclassical Boltzmann transport equations (BTE) with
the aim of understanding the effects of intrinsic optical phonon and extrinsic coulomb scattering
caused by charged impurities at the graphene{substrate interface. We employ iterative solutions
of the BTE and the comprehensive model for the temporal evolutions of hot-carrier temperature and
hot-optical-phonon occupations to reduce computational costs, instead of using full-BTE solutions.
Undoped graphene exhibited large positive photoconductivity owing to the increase in thermally
excited carriers and the reduction in charged impurity scattering. The frequency dependencies
of the photoconductivity in undoped graphene with high concentrations of charged impurities significantly
deviated from that observed in the simple Drude model, which is attributed to temporally varying
charged impurity scattering during terahertz (THz) probing in the hot-carrier cooling process.
Heavily doped graphene exhibited small negative photoconductivity similar to that of the Drude
model. In this case, charged impurity scattering is substantially suppressed by the carrier-screening
effect, and the temperature dependencies of the Drude weight and optical phonon scattering govern
negative photoconductivity. In lightly doped graphene, the photoconductivity changes its sign
temporally after the photoexcitation, depending on the carrier and optical phonon temperatures
and the pump uence. Moreover, the photoconductivity spectra depend not only on the material property
of graphene sample but also on the waveform of the THz-probe pulse. Our approach provides a quantitative
understanding of non-Drude behaviors and the temporal evolution of photoconductivity in graphene.

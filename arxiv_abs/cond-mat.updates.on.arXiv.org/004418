We propose a deep neural network (DNN) as a fast surrogate model for local stress (and in principle
strain) calculation in inhomogeneous non-linear material systems. We show that the DNN predicts
the local stresses with about 3.8% mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) for the case of heterogeneous
elastic media and a mechanical phase contrast of up to factor of 1.5 among neighboring domains, while
performing 103 times faster than spectral solvers. The speed-up arises from the fact that after
training, the DNN predicts the stress without any iterations, as opposed to the iterative nature
of standard non-linear solvers. The new DNN surrogate model also proves suited for general purposes:
it is capable to reproduce the stress distribution in geometries topologically far different from
those used for training, implying effective learning of scenarios described by the underlying
partial differential equations. Even in the case of elasto-plastic materials with up to 2 times
mechanical contrast in elastic stiffness and 4 times in yield stress among adjacent regions, where
conventional solvers typically require a substantial number of iterations to arrive at stress
predictions, the trained model simulates the micromechanics with a MAPE of 6.4% in one single forward
evaluation step of the network, i.e. without any iterative calculations even for the case of such
a non-linear problem. The results reveal a completely new and highly efficient approach to solve
non-linear mechanical boundary value problems and/or augment existing solution methods in corresponding
hybrid variants, with an acceleration up to factor of 8300 for heterogeneous elastic-plastic materials
in comparison to the currently fastest available solvers.

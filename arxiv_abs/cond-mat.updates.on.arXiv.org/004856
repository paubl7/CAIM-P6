Magneto-rheological elastomers (MREs) are functional materials that can be actuated by applying
an external magnetic field. MREs comprise a composite of hard magnetic particles dispersed into
a nonmagnetic elastomeric matrix. By applying a strong magnetic field, one can magnetize the structure
to program its deformation under the subsequent application of an external field. Hard MREs, whose
coercivities are large, have been receiving particular attention because the programmed magnetization
remains unchanged upon actuation. Hence, once a structure made of a hard MRE is magnetized, it can
be regarded as magnetized permanently. Motivated by a new realm of applications, there have been
significant theoretical developments in the continuum description of hard MREs. By reducing the
3D description into 1D or 2D via dimensional reduction, several theories of hard magnetic slender
structures such as linear beams, elastica, and shells have been recently proposed. In this paper,
we derive an effective theory for MRE rods under geometrically nonlinear 3D deformation. Our theory
is based on reducing the 3D magneto-elastic energy functional for the hard MREs into a 1D Kirchhoff-like
description. Restricting the theory to 2D, we reproduce previous works on planar deformations.
For further validation in the general case of 3D deformation, we perform precision experiments
with both naturally straight and curved rods under either constant or constant-gradient magnetic
fields. Our theoretical predictions are in excellent agreement with both discrete simulations
and precision-model experiments. Finally, we discuss some limitations of our framework, as highlighted
by the experiments, where long-range dipole interactions, which are neglected in the theory, can
play a role.

The study of hard-particle packings is of fundamental importance in physics, chemistry, cell biology,
and discrete geometry. Much of the previous work on hard-particle packings concerns their densest
possible arrangements. By contrast, we examine kinetic effects inevitably present in both numerical
and experimental packing protocols. Specifically, we determine how changing the compression/shear
rate of a two-dimensional packing of noncircular particles causes it to deviate from its densest
possible configuration, which is always periodic. The adaptive shrinking cell (ASC) optimization
scheme maximizes the packing fraction of a hard-particle packing by first applying random translations
and rotations to the particles and then isotropically compressing and shearing the simulation
box repeatedly until a possibly jammed state is reached. We use a stochastic implementation of the
ASC optimization scheme to mimic different effective time scales by varying the number of particle
moves between compressions/shears. We generate dense, effectively jammed, monodisperse, two-dimensional
packings of obtuse scalene triangle, rhombus, curved triangle, lens, and "ice cream cone" (a semicircle
grafted onto an isosceles triangle) shaped particles, with a wide range of packing fractions and
degrees of order. To quantify these kinetic effects, we introduce the kinetic frustration index
$K$, which measures the deviation of a packing from its maximum possible packing fraction. To investigate
how kinetics affect short- and long-range ordering in these packings, we compute their spectral
densities and characterize their contact networks. We find that kinetic effects are most significant
when the particles have greater asphericity, less curvature, and less rotational symmetry. This
work may be relevant to the design of laboratory packing protocols.

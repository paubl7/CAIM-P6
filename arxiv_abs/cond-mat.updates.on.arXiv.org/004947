While ferromagnets have been known and exploited for millennia, antiferromagnets (AFMs) were
only discovered in the 1930s. The elusive nature indicates AFMs' unique properties: At large scale,
due to the absence of global magnetization, AFMs may appear to behave like any non-magnetic material;
However, such a seemingly mundane macroscopic magnetic property is highly nontrivial at microscopic
level, where opposite spin alignment within the AFM unit cell forms a rich internal structure. In
topological AFMs, such an internal structure leads to a new possibility, where topology and Berry
phase can acquire distinct spatial textures. Here, we study this exciting possibility in an AFM
Axion insulator, even-layered MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ flakes, where spatial degrees of freedom correspond
to different layers. Remarkably, we report the observation of a new type of Hall effect, the layer
Hall effect, where electrons from the top and bottom layers spontaneously deflect in opposite directions.
Specifically, under no net electric field, even-layered MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ shows no anomalous Hall
effect (AHE); However, applying an electric field isolates the response from one layer and leads
to the surprising emergence of a large layer-polarized AHE (~50%$\frac{e^2}{h}$). Such a layer
Hall effect uncovers a highly rare layer-locked Berry curvature, which serves as a unique character
of the space-time $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric AFM topological insulator state. Moreover, we found
that the layer-locked Berry curvature can be manipulated by the Axion field, E$\cdot$B, which drives
the system between the opposite AFM states. Our results achieve previously unavailable pathways
to detect and manipulate the rich internal spatial structure of fully-compensated topological
AFMs. The layer-locked Berry curvature represents a first step towards spatial engineering of
Berry phase, such as through layer-specific moir\'e potential.

The Meissner effect is one of the defining properties of superconductivity, with a conventional
superconductor completely repelling an external magnetic field. In contrast to this diamagnetic
behavior, odd-frequency superconducting pairing has often been seen to produce a paramagnetic
Meissner effect, which instead makes the superconductor unstable due to the attraction of magnetic
field. In this work we study how both even- and odd-frequency superconducting pairing contributes
to the Meissner effect in a generic two-orbital superconductor with a tunable odd-frequency pairing
component. By dividing the contributions to the Meissner effect into intra- and inter-band processes,
we find that the odd-frequency pairing actually generates both dia- and paramagnetic Meissner
responses, determined by the normal-state band structure. More specifically, for materials with
two electron-like (hole-like) low-energy bands we find that the odd-frequency inter-band contribution
is paramagnetic but nearly canceled by a diamagnetic odd-frequency intra-band contribution.
Combined with a diamagnetic even-frequency contribution, such superconductors thus always display
a large diamagnetic Meissner response to an external magnetic field, even in the presence of large
odd-frequency pairing. For materials with an inverted, or topological, band structure, we find
the odd-frequency inter-band contribution to instead be diamagnetic and even the dominating contribution
to the Meissner effect in the near-metallic regime. Taken together, our results show that odd-frequency
pairing in multi-orbital superconductors does not generate a destabilizing paramagnetic Meissner
effect and can even generate a diamagnetic response in topological materials.

Recent experimental progress in designing electronic states in layered heterostructures raises
questions about inducing topological states in inhomogeneous systems. In particular, it has become
clear that there is a delicate interplay of multiple spin-orbit terms induced in graphene on incommensurate
transition metal dichalcogenide substrates, so that nano- to mesoscopic domains of different
spin-orbit and mass values may form. We therefore investigate various types of domain walls in graphene
looking for robust propagating electronic states, first by finding the states via analytical and
topological arguments in the low-energy theory, and then studying their robustness to symmetry
breaking and lattice backscattering effects in a tight-binding model. Surprisingly, we find that
a sign-changing domain wall in Valley-Zeeman (VZ) spin-orbit coupling binds two robust Kramers
pairs within the bulkgap opened due to a simultaneous presence of Rashba (R) coupling. We show the
relation of these modes to a domain wall in gating of bilayer graphene. In a contrasting example,
a sign-changing Kane-Mele (KM) spin-orbit coupling domain wall between two domains in the topological
insulator (TI) phase, equivalent to two copies of a TI edge, has two pairs of helical modes that are
stable to intervalley scattering, but not stable to breaking $S_z$ symmetry, e.g., by a Rashba term.
Nevertheless, there are also higher excited modes on a smooth KM domain wall which mimic Landau-levels
of free spinless graphene. We also introduce a domain wall by rotating the spin direction of the Kane-Mele
term in a spiral, and analytically explain the closing bulkgap and the lack of in-gap modes. We discuss
the possible spectroscopic and transport signatures in heterostructures.

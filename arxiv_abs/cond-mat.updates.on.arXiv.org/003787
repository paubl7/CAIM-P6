In this work, we study the effect of dipole-dipole interparticle interactions on the static thermodynamic
and magnetic properties of an ensemble of immobilized monodisperse superparamagnetic nanoparticles.
We assume that magnetic nanoparticles are embedded in the nodes of a regular cubic lattice, so that
the particle translational degrees of freedom are turned off. The relaxation of the magnetic moments
of the nanoparticles occurs by the N{\'e}el mechanism. The easy axes are distributed according
to the particular configuration: these are (i) aligned parallel or (ii) perpendicular to the direction
of an external field. These models are investigated using theory and computer simulation, taking
microscopic discrete structure explicitly into account. The theory is based on a virial expansion
of the Helmholtz free energy up to the second virial coefficient. The analytical expressions of
the Helmholtz free energy, the static magnetization, and the initial magnetic susceptibility
are derived as functions of the height of the magnetic crystallographic anisotropy energy barrier
for the internal superparamagnetic rotation of magnetic moments inside the nanoparticles, measured
by parameter $\sigma$, and the intensity of the dipole-dipole interparticle interactions measured
by $\lambda_e$. A good agreement between the theory and the results of MC simulations in the region
of low and moderate values of $\lambda_e$ and $\sigma$ is obtained. For high values of $\lambda_e$
and $\sigma$, the structuring of magnetic moments in regularly orientated structures was found
from MC simulations for configuration (i). A phase diagram of the orientational state of the magnetic
moments on the $\lambda_e$ - $\sigma$ axes was plotted for configuration (i), which predicts the
regions of regularly orientated structuring and the absence of any structures belonging to the
nanoparticle magnetic moments.

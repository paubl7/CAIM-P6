Stack Overflow hosts valuable programming-related knowledge with 11,926,354 links that reference
to the third-party websites. The links that reference to the resources hosted outside the Stack
Overflow websites extend the Stack Overflow knowledge base substantially. However, with the rapid
development of programming-related knowledge, many resources hosted on the Internet are not available
anymore. Based on our analysis of the Stack Overflow data that was released on Jun. 2, 2019, 14.2%
of the links on Stack Overflow are broken links. The broken links on Stack Overflow can obstruct viewers
from obtaining desired programming-related knowledge, and potentially damage the reputation
of the Stack Overflow as viewers might regard the posts with broken links as obsolete. In this paper,
we characterize the broken links on Stack Overflow. 65% of the broken links in our sampled questions
are used to show examples, e.g., code examples. 70% of the broken links in our sampled answers are
used to provide supporting information, e.g., explaining a certain concept and describing a step
to solve a problem. Only 1.67% of the posts with broken links are highlighted as such by viewers in
the posts' comments. Only 5.8% of the posts with broken links removed the broken links. Viewers cannot
fully rely on the vote scores to detect broken links, as broken links are common across posts with
different vote scores. The websites that host resources that can be maintained by their users are
referenced by broken links the most on Stack Overflow -- a prominent example of such websites is GitHub.
The posts and comments related to the web technologies, i.e., JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and jQuery,
are associated with more broken links. Based on our findings, we shed lights for future directions
and provide recommendations for practitioners and researchers.

We show that the existence of a ``good'' coupling w.r.t. Hamming distance for any local Markov chain
on a discrete product space implies rapid mixing of the Glauber dynamics in a blackbox fashion. More
specifically, we only require the expected distance between successive iterates under the coupling
to be summable, as opposed to being one-step contractive in the worst case. Combined with recent
local-to-global arguments \cite{CLV21}, we establish asymptotically optimal lower bounds on
the standard and modified log-Sobolev constants for the Glauber dynamics for sampling from spin
systems on bounded-degree graphs when a curvature condition \cite{Oll09} is satisfied. To achieve
this, we use Stein's method for Markov chains \cite{BN19, RR19} to show that a ``good'' coupling
for a local Markov chain yields strong bounds on the spectral independence of the distribution in
the sense of \cite{ALO20}. Our primary application is to sampling proper list-colorings on bounded-degree
graphs. In particular, combining the coupling for the flip dynamics given by \cite{Vig00, CDMPP19}
with our techniques, we show optimal $O(n\log n)$ mixing for the Glauber dynamics for sampling proper
list-colorings on any bounded-degree graph with maximum degree $\Delta$ whenever the size of the
color lists are at least $\left(\frac{11}{6} - \epsilon\right)\Delta$, where $\epsilon \approx
10^{-5}$ is small constant. While $O(n^{2})$ mixing was already known before, our approach additionally
yields Chernoff-type concentration bounds for Hamming Lipschitz functions in this regime, which
was not known before. Our approach is markedly different from prior works establishing spectral
independence for spin systems using spatial mixing \cite{ALO20, CLV20, CGSV20, FGYZ20}, which
crucially is still open in this regime for proper list-colorings.

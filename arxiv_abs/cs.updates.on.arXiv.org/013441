To understand the important dimensions of service quality from the passenger's perspective and
tailor service offerings for competitive advantage, airlines can capitalize on the abundantly
available online customer reviews (OCR). The objective of this paper is to discover company- and
competitor-specific intelligence from OCR using an unsupervised text analytics approach. First,
the key aspects (or topics) discussed in the OCR are extracted using three topic models - probabilistic
latent semantic analysis (pLSA) and two variants of Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA-VI and LDA-GS).
Subsequently, we propose an ensemble-assisted topic model (EA-TM), which integrates the individual
topic models, to classify each review sentence to the most representative aspect. Likewise, to
determine the sentiment corresponding to a review sentence, an ensemble sentiment analyzer (E-SA),
which combines the predictions of three opinion mining methods (AFINN, SentiStrength, and VADER),
is developed. An aspect-based opinion summary (AOS), which provides a snapshot of passenger-perceived
strengths and weaknesses of an airline, is established by consolidating the sentiments associated
with each aspect. Furthermore, a bi-gram analysis of the labeled OCR is employed to perform root
cause analysis within each identified aspect. A case study involving 99,147 airline reviews of
a US-based target carrier and four of its competitors is used to validate the proposed approach.
The results indicate that a cost- and time-effective performance summary of an airline and its competitors
can be obtained from OCR. Finally, besides providing theoretical and managerial implications
based on our results, we also provide implications for post-pandemic preparedness in the airline
industry considering the unprecedented impact of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and predictions
on similar pandemics in the future.

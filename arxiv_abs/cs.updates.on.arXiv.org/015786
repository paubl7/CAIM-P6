We present PSEUDo, an adaptive feature learning technique for exploring visual patterns in multi-track
sequential data. Our approach is designed with the primary focus to overcome the uneconomic retraining
requirements and inflexible representation learning in current deep learning-based systems.
Multi-track time series data are generated on an unprecedented scale due to increased sensors and
data storage. These datasets hold valuable patterns, like in neuromarketing, where researchers
try to link patterns in multivariate sequential data from physiological sensors to the purchase
behavior of products and services. But a lack of ground truth and high variance make automatic pattern
detection unreliable. Our advancements are based on a novel query-aware locality-sensitive hashing
technique to create a feature-based representation of multivariate time series windows. Most
importantly, our algorithm features sub-linear training and inference time. We can even accomplish
both the modeling and comparison of 10,000 different 64-track time series, each with 100 time steps
(a typical EEG dataset) under 0.8 seconds. This performance gain allows for a rapid relevance feedback-driven
adaption of the underlying pattern similarity model and enables the user to modify the speed-vs-accuracy
trade-off gradually. We demonstrate superiority of PSEUDo in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and
steerability through a quantitative performance comparison and a qualitative visual quality
comparison to the state-of-the-art algorithms in the field. Moreover, we showcase the usability
of PSEUDo through a case study demonstrating our visual pattern retrieval concepts in a large meteorological
dataset. We find that our adaptive models can accurately capture the user's notion of similarity
and allow for an understandable exploratory visual pattern retrieval in large multivariate time
series datasets.

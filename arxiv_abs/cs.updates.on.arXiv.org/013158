Social distancing is a recommended solution by the World Health Organisation (WHO) to minimise
the spread of COVID-19 in public places. The majority of governments and national health authorities
have set the 2-meter physical distancing as a mandatory safety measure in shopping centres, schools
and other covered areas. In this research, we develop a hybrid Computer Vision and YOLOv4-based
Deep Neural Network model for automated people detection in the crowd in indoor and outdoor environments
using common CCTV security cameras. The proposed DNN model in combination with an adapted inverse
perspective mapping (IPM) technique and SORT tracking algorithm leads to a robust people detection
and social distancing monitoring. The model has been trained against two most comprehensive datasets
by the time of the research the Microsoft Common Objects in Context (MS COCO) and Google Open Image
datasets. The system has been evaluated against the Oxford Town Centre dataset with superior performance
compared to three state-of-the-art methods. The evaluation has been conducted in challenging
conditions, including occlusion, partial visibility, and under lighting variations with the
mean average precision of 99.8% and the real-time speed of 24.1 fps. We also provide an online infection
risk assessment scheme by statistical analysis of the Spatio-temporal data from people's moving
trajectories and the rate of social distancing violations. The developed model is a generic and
accurate people detection and tracking solution that can be applied in many other fields such as
autonomous vehicles, human action recognition, anomaly detection, sports, crowd analysis, or
any other research areas where the human detection is in the centre of attention.

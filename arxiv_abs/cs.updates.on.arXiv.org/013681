In 2019, outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases reached the highest number in the US since 1992.
Medical misinformation, such as antivaccine content propagating through social media, is associated
with increases in vaccine delay and refusal. Our overall goal is to develop an automatic detector
for antivaccine messages to counteract the negative impact that antivaccine messages have on the
public health. Very few extant detection systems have considered multimodality of social media
posts (images, texts, and hashtags), and instead focus on textual components, despite the rapid
growth of photo-sharing applications (e.g., Instagram). As a result, existing systems are not
sufficient for detecting antivaccine messages with heavy visual components (e.g., images) posted
on these newer platforms. To solve this problem, we propose a deep learning network that leverages
both visual and textual information. A new semantic- and task-level attention mechanism was created
to help our model to focus on the essential contents of a post that signal antivaccine messages. The
proposed model, which consists of three branches, can generate comprehensive fused features for
predictions. Moreover, an ensemble method is proposed to further improve the final prediction
accuracy. To evaluate the proposed model's performance, a real-world social media dataset that
consists of more than 30,000 samples was collected from Instagram between January 2016 and October
2019. Our 30 experiment results demonstrate that the final network achieves above 97% testing accuracy
and outperforms other relevant models, demonstrating that it can detect a large amount of antivaccine
messages posted daily. The implementation code is available at https://github.com/wzhings/antivaccine_detection.

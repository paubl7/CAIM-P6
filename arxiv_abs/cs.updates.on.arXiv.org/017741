Due to the variety of cyber-attacks or threats, the cybersecurity community has been enhancing
the traditional security control mechanisms to an advanced level so that automated tools can encounter
potential security threats. Very recently a term, Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) has been represented
as one of the proactive and robust mechanisms because of its automated cybersecurity threat prediction
based on data. In general, CTI collects and analyses data from various sources e.g. online security
forums, social media where cyber enthusiasts, analysts, even cybercriminals discuss cyber or
computer security related topics and discovers potential threats based on the analysis. As the
manual analysis of every such discussion i.e. posts on online platforms is time-consuming, inefficient,
and susceptible to errors, CTI as an automated tool can perform uniquely to detect cyber threats.
In this paper, our goal is to identify and explore relevant CTI from hacker forums by using different
supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. To this end, we collect data from a real hacker
forum and constructed two datasets: a binary dataset and a multi-class dataset. Our binary dataset
contains two classes one containing cybersecurity-relevant posts and another one containing
posts that are not related to security. This dataset is constructed using simple keyword search
technique. Using a similar approach, we further categorize posts from security-relevant posts
into five different threat categories. We then applied several machine learning classifiers along
with deep neural network-based classifiers and use them on the datasets to compare their performances.
We also tested the classifiers on a leaked dataset with labels named nulled.io as our ground truth.
We further explore the datasets using unsupervised techniques i.e. Latent Dirichlet Allocation
(LDA) and Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF).

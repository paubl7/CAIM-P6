The elastic properties of materials derive from their electronic and atomic nature. However, simulating
bulk materials fully at these scales is not feasible, so that typically homogenized continuum descriptions
are used instead. A seamless and lossless transition of the constitutive description of the elastic
response of materials between these two scales has been so far elusive. Here we show how this problem
can be overcome by using Artificial Intelligence (AI). A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model
is trained, by taking the structure image of a nanoporous material as input and the corresponding
elasticity tensor, calculated from Molecular Statics (MS), as output. Trained with the atomistic
data, the CNN model captures the size- and pore-dependency of the material's elastic properties
which, on the physics side, can stem from surfaces and non-local effects. Such effects are often
ignored in upscaling from atomistic to classical continuum theory. To demonstrate the accuracy
and the efficiency of the trained CNN model, a Finite Element Method (FEM) based result of an elastically
deformed nanoporous beam equipped with the CNN as constitutive law is compared with that by a full
atomistic simulation. The good agreement between the atomistic simulations and the FEM-AI combination
for a system with size and surface effects establishes a new lossless scale bridging approach to
such problems. The trained CNN model deviates from the atomistic result by 9.6\% for porosity scenarios
of up to 90\% but it is about 230 times faster than the MS calculation and does not require to change
simulation methods between different scales. The efficiency of the CNN evaluation together with
the preservation of important atomistic effects makes the trained model an effective atomistically-informed
constitutive model for macroscopic simulations of nanoporous materials and solving of inverse
problems.

Deployment of optical network infrastructure and network services is growing exponentially for
beyond 5G networks. Since the uptake of e-commerce and e-services has seen unprecedented serge
in recent months due to the global COVID-19 pandemic era, the security of such transactions in optical
communication has gained much importance. Optical fiber communication networks are vulnerable
to several types of security threats, such as single point failure, wormhole attacks, and sybil
attacks. Therefore, blockchain is a promising solution to protect confidential information against
attacks and helps in achieving trusted network architecture by creating a distributed ledger platform.
Recently, blockchain has received much attention because of its decentralized and distributed
ledger technology. Hence, blockchain has also been employed to protect network against such attacks.
However, blockchain technology's security relies on the platform of computational complexity,
and because of the evolution of quantum computers, it will become insecure in the near future. Therefore,
for enhancing blockchain security, research focus on combining quantum key distribution (QKD)
with blockchain. This new technology is known as quantum-secured blockchain. The article describes
the attacks in optical networks and provides a solution to protect network against security attacks
by employing quantum-secured blockchain in optical networks. It provides a brief overview of blockchain
technology with its security loopholes and focuses on QKD, which makes blockchain technology more
robust against quantum-attacks. Next, the article provides a broad view of quantum-secured blockchain
and presents the network architecture for future research and development of secure and trusted
optical communication networks using quantum-secured blockchain.

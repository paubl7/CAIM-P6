Automated lobar segmentation allows regional evaluation of lung disease and is important for diagnosis
and therapy planning. Advanced statistical workflows permitting such evaluation is a needed area
within respiratory medicine; their adoption remains slow, with poor workflow accuracy. Diseased
lung regions often produce high-density zones on CT images, limiting an algorithm's execution
to specify damaged lobes due to oblique or lacking fissures. This impact motivated developing an
improved machine learning method to segment lung lobes that utilises tracheobronchial tree information
to enhance segmentation accuracy through the algorithm's spatial familiarity to define lobar
extent more accurately. The method undertakes parallel segmentation of lobes and auxiliary tissues
simultaneously by employing multi-task learning (MTL) in conjunction with V-Net-attention,
a popular convolutional neural network in the imaging realm. In keeping with the model's adeptness
for better generalisation, high performance was retained in an external dataset of patients with
four distinct diseases: severe lung cancer, COVID-19 pneumonitis, collapsed lungs and Chronic
Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), even though the training data included none of these cases.
The benefit of our external validation test is specifically relevant since our choice includes
those patients who have diagnosed lung disease with associated radiological abnormalities. To
ensure equal rank is given to all segmentations in the main task we report the following performance
(Dice score) on a per-segment basis: normal lungs 0.97, COPD 0.94, lung cancer 0.94, COVID-19 pneumonitis
0.94 and collapsed lung 0.92, all at p<0.05. Even segmenting lobes with large deformations on CT
images, the model maintained high accuracy. The approach can be readily adopted in the clinical
setting as a robust tool for radiologists.

With the advent of off-the-shelf intelligent home products and broader internet adoption, researchers
increasingly explore smart computing applications that provide easier access to health and wellness
resources. AI-based systems like chatbots have the potential to provide services that could provide
mental health support. However, existing therapy chatbots are often retrieval-based, requiring
users to respond with a constrained set of answers, which may not be appropriate given that such pre-determined
inquiries may not reflect each patient's unique circumstances. Generative-based approaches,
such as the OpenAI GPT models, could allow for more dynamic conversations in therapy chatbot contexts
than previous approaches. To investigate the generative-based model's potential in therapy chatbot
contexts, we built a chatbot using the GPT-2 model. We fine-tuned it with 306 therapy session transcripts
between family caregivers of individuals with dementia and therapists conducting Problem Solving
Therapy. We then evaluated the model's pre-trained and the fine-tuned model in terms of basic qualities
using three meta-information measurements: the proportion of non-word outputs, the length of
response, and sentiment components. Results showed that: (1) the fine-tuned model created more
non-word outputs than the pre-trained model; (2) the fine-tuned model generated outputs whose
length was more similar to that of the therapists compared to the pre-trained model; (3) both the
pre-trained model and fine-tuned model were likely to generate more negative and fewer positive
outputs than the therapists. We discuss potential reasons for the problem, the implications, and
solutions for developing therapy chatbots and call for investigations of the AI-based system application.

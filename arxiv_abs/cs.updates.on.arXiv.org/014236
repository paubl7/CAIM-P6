Automatic detection of firearms is important for enhancing the security and safety of people, however,
it is a challenging task owing to the wide variations in shape, size, and appearance of firearms.
Also, most of the generic object detectors process axis-aligned rectangular areas though, a thin
and long rifle may actually cover only a small percentage of that area and the rest may contain irrelevant
details suppressing the required object signatures. To handle these challenges, we propose a weakly
supervised Orientation Aware Object Detection (OAOD) algorithm which learns to detect oriented
object bounding boxes (OBB) while using AxisAligned Bounding Boxes (AABB) for training. The proposed
OAOD is different from the existing oriented object detectors which strictly require OBB during
training which may not always be present. The goal of training on AABB and detection of OBB is achieved
by employing a multistage scheme, with Stage-1 predicting the AABB and Stage-2 predicting OBB.
In-between the two stages, the oriented proposal generation module along with the object aligned
RoI pooling is designed to extract features based on the predicted orientation and to make these
features orientation invariant. A diverse and challenging dataset consisting of eleven thousand
images is also proposed for firearm detection which is manually annotated for firearm classification
and localization. The proposed ITU Firearm dataset (ITUF) contains a wide range of guns and rifles.
The OAOD algorithm is evaluated on the ITUF dataset and compared with current state-of-the-art
object detectors, including fully supervised oriented object detectors. OAOD has outperformed
both types of object detectors with a significant margin. The experimental results (mAP: 88.3 on
AABB & mAP: 77.5 on OBB) demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm for firearm detection.

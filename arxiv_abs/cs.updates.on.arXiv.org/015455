Geometrically complex masonry structures (e.g., arches, domes, vaults) are traditionally built
with expensive scaffolding or falsework to provide stability during construction. The process
of building such structures can potentially be improved through the use of multiple robots working
together in a cooperative assembly framework. Here a robot is envisioned as both a placement and
external support agent during fabrication - the unfinished structure is supported in such a way
that scaffolding is not required. The goal of this paper is to present and validate the efficacy of
three cooperative fabrication approaches using two or three robots, for the scaffold-free construction
of a stable masonry arch from which a medium-span vault is built. A simplified numerical method to
represent a masonry structure is first presented and validated to analyse systems composed of discrete
volumetric elements. This method is then used to evaluate the effect of the three cooperative robotic
fabrication strategies on the stability performance of the central arch. The sequential method
and cantilever method, which utilize two robotic arms, are shown to be viable methods, but have challenges
related to scalability and robustness. By adding a third robotic agent, it becomes possible to determine
a structurally optimal fabrication sequence through a multi-objective optimization process.
The optimized three robot method is shown to significantly improve the structural behavior over
all fabrication steps. The modeling approaches presented in this paper are broadly formulated
and widely applicable for the analysis of cooperative robotic fabrication sequences for the construction
of discrete element structures across scales and materials.

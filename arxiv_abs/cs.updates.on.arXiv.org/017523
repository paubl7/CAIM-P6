Integrity constraints such as functional dependencies (FD) and multi-valued dependencies (MVD)
are fundamental in database schema design. Likewise, probabilistic conditional independences
(CI) are crucial for reasoning about multivariate probability distributions. The implication
problem studies whether a set of constraints (antecedents) implies another constraint (consequent),
and has been investigated in both the database and the AI literature, under the assumption that all
constraints hold {\em exactly}. However, many applications today consider constraints that hold
only {\em approximately}. In this paper we define an approximate implication as a linear inequality
between the degree of satisfaction of the antecedents and consequent, and we study the {\em relaxation
problem}: when does an exact implication relax to an approximate implication? We use information
theory to define the degree of satisfaction, and prove several results. First, we show that any implication
from a set of data dependencies (MVDs+FDs) can be relaxed to a simple linear inequality with a factor
at most quadratic in the number of variables; when the consequent is an FD, the factor can be reduced
to 1. Second, we prove that there exists an implication between CIs that does not admit any relaxation;
however, we prove that every implication between CIs relaxes ``in the limit''. Then, we show that
the implication problem for differential constraints in market basket analysis also admits a relaxation
with a factor equal to 1. Finally, we show how some of the results in the paper can be derived using the
{\em I-measure} theory, which relates between information theoretic measures and set theory.
Our results recover, and sometimes extend, previously known results about the implication problem:
the implication of MVDs and FDs can be checked by considering only 2-tuple relations.

The 3D building modelling is important in urban planning and related domains that draw upon the content
of 3D models of urban scenes. Such 3D models can be used to visualize city images at multiple scales
from individual buildings to entire cities prior to and after a change has occurred. This ability
is of great importance in day-to-day work and special projects undertaken by planners, geo-designers,
and architects. In this research, we implemented a novel approach to 3D building models for such
matter, which included the integration of geographic information systems (GIS) and 3D Computer
Graphics (3DCG) components that generate 3D house models from building footprints (polygons),
and the automated generation of simple and complex roof geometries for rapid roof area damage reporting.
These polygons (footprints) are usually orthogonal. A complicated orthogonal polygon can be partitioned
into a set of rectangles. The proposed GIS and 3DCG integrated system partitions orthogonal building
polygons into a set of rectangles and places rectangular roofs and box-shaped building bodies on
these rectangles. Since technicians are drawing these polygons manually with digitizers, depending
on aerial photos, not all building polygons are precisely orthogonal. But, when placing a set of
boxes as building bodies for creating the buildings, there may be gaps or overlaps between these
boxes if building polygons are not precisely orthogonal. In our proposal, after approximately
orthogonal building polygons are partitioned and rectified into a set of mutually orthogonal rectangles,
each rectangle knows which rectangle is adjacent to and which edge of the rectangle is adjacent to,
which will avoid unwanted intersection of windows and doors when building bodies combined.

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have brought a lot of flexibility in the network deployment. However,
UAVs suffer from the high mobility and instability. To improve the capacity and reliability of the
UAV networks, millimeter-wave (mmWave) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) can be
used in the system. In this paper, we consider an RIS-assisted mmWave UAV wireless cellular network,
where UAVs serve several users with the help of multiple RISs. We jointly optimize the deployment,
user scheduling, beamforming vector, and RIS phases to maximize the sum-rate, with the constraints
of the minimum rate, the UAV movement, the analog beamforming, and the RIS phases. To solve this complex
problem, we use an iterative method, in which when we optimize one variable, we fix the other three
variables. When optimizing the deployment, we find the optimal position for the UAV by a sphere search.
Then, we formulate a mixed-integer non-linear problem (MINLP) to find the best scheduling. A spatial
branch-and-bound (sBnB) method is used to solve the MINLP. When Optimizing the beamforming vector
and the RIS phases, we propose an iterative algorithm that relies on the equivalence between the
maximization of the sum-rate and the minimization of the summation of weighted mean-square errors
(sum-WMMSE). The majority-minimization method is used to deal with the constant-modulus constraints
for the analog beamforming and RIS phases. The proposed joint optimization offers significant
advantages over the system without beamforming and RIS phase optimization and the system without
deployment optimization. In addition, the RIS can compensate for the loss of throughput due to the
blockage, especially in low flight altitudes.

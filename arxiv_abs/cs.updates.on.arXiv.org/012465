We revisit the so-called compressed oracle technique, introduced by Zhandry for analyzing quantum
algorithms in the quantum random oracle model (QROM). To start off with, we offer a concise exposition
of the technique, which easily extends to the parallel-query QROM, where in each query-round the
considered algorithm may make several queries to the QROM in parallel. This variant of the QROM allows
for a more fine-grained query-complexity analysis. Our main technical contribution is a framework
that simplifies the use of (the parallel-query generalization of) the compressed oracle technique
for proving query complexity results. With our framework in place, whenever applicable, it is possible
to prove quantum query complexity lower bounds by means of purely classical reasoning. More than
that, for typical examples the crucial classical observations that give rise to the classical bounds
are sufficient to conclude the corresponding quantum bounds. We demonstrate this on a few examples,
recovering known results (like the optimality of parallel Grover), but also obtaining new results
(like the optimality of parallel BHT collision search). Our main target is the hardness of finding
a $q$-chain with fewer than $q$ parallel queries, i.e., a sequence $x_0, x_1,\ldots, x_q$ with $x_i
= H(x_{i-1})$ for all $1 \leq i \leq q$. The above problem of finding a hash chain is of fundamental
importance in the context of proofs of sequential work. Indeed, as a concrete cryptographic application
of our techniques, we prove that the "Simple Proofs of Sequential Work" proposed by Cohen and Pietrzak
remains secure against quantum attacks. Such an analysis is not simply a matter of plugging in our
new bound; the entire protocol needs to be analyzed in the light of a quantum attack. Thanks to our
framework, this can now be done with purely classical reasoning.

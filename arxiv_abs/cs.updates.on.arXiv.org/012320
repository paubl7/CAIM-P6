A central question in neuroscience is how self-organizing dynamic interactions in the brain emerge
on their relatively static structural backbone. Due to the complexity of spatial and temporal dependencies
between different brain areas, fully comprehending the interplay between structure and function
is still challenging and an area of intense research. In this paper we present a graph neural network
(GNN) framework, to describe functional interactions based on the structural anatomical layout.
A GNN allows us to process graph-structured spatio-temporal signals, providing a possibility
to combine structural information derived from diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) with temporal neural
activity profiles, like observed in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Moreover,
dynamic interactions between different brain regions learned by this data-driven approach can
provide a multi-modal measure of causal connectivity strength. We assess the proposed model's
accuracy by evaluating its capabilities to replicate empirically observed neural activation
profiles, and compare the performance to those of a vector auto regression (VAR), like typically
used in Granger causality. We show that GNNs are able to capture long-term dependencies in data and
also computationally scale up to the analysis of large-scale networks. Finally we confirm that
features learned by a GNN can generalize across MRI scanner types and acquisition protocols, by
demonstrating that the performance on small datasets can be improved by pre-training the GNN on
data from an earlier and different study. We conclude that the proposed multi-modal GNN framework
can provide a novel perspective on the structure-function relationship in the brain. Therewith
this approach can be promising for the characterization of the information flow in brain networks.

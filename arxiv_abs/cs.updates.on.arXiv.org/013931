A natural problem in high-dimensional inference is to decide if a classifier $f:\mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow
\{-1,1\}$ depends on a small number of linear directions of its input data. Call a function $g: \mathbb{R}^n
\rightarrow \{-1,1\}$, a linear $k$-junta if it is completely determined by some $k$-dimensional
subspace of the input space. A recent work of the authors showed that linear $k$-juntas are testable.
Thus there exists an algorithm to distinguish between: 1. $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \{-1,1\}$
which is a linear $k$-junta with surface area $s$, 2. $f$ is $\epsilon$-far from any linear $k$-junta
with surface area $(1+\epsilon)s$, where the query complexity of the algorithm is independent
of the ambient dimension $n$. Following the surge of interest in noise-tolerant property testing,
in this paper we prove a noise-tolerant (or robust) version of this result. Namely, we give an algorithm
which given any $c>0$, $\epsilon>0$, distinguishes between 1. $f: \mathbb{R}^n \rightarrow \{-1,1\}$
has correlation at least $c$ with some linear $k$-junta with surface area $s$. 2. $f$ has correlation
at most $c-\epsilon$ with any linear $k$-junta with surface area at most $s$. The query complexity
of our tester is $k^{\mathsf{poly}(s/\epsilon)}$. Using our techniques, we also obtain a fully
noise tolerant tester with the same query complexity for any class $\mathcal{C}$ of linear $k$-juntas
with surface area bounded by $s$. As a consequence, we obtain a fully noise tolerant tester with query
complexity $k^{O(\mathsf{poly}(\log k/\epsilon))}$ for the class of intersection of $k$-halfspaces
(for constant $k$) over the Gaussian space. Our query complexity is independent of the ambient dimension
$n$. Previously, no non-trivial noise tolerant testers were known even for a single halfspace.

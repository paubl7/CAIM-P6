Given a directed graph $G = (V,E)$, undergoing an online sequence of edge deletions with $m$ edges
in the initial version of $G$ and $n = |V|$, we consider the problem of maintaining all-pairs shortest
paths (APSP) in $G$. Whilst this problem has been studied in a long line of research [ACM'81, FOCS'99,
FOCS'01, STOC'02, STOC'03, SWAT'04, STOC'13] and the problem of $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate,
weighted APSP was solved to near-optimal update time $\tilde{O}(mn)$ by Bernstein [STOC'13],
the problem has mainly been studied in the context of oblivious adversaries, which assumes that
the adversary fixes the update sequence before the algorithm is started. In this paper, we make significant
progress on the problem in the setting where the adversary is adaptive, i.e. can base the update sequence
on the output of the data structure queries. We present three new data structures that fit different
settings: We first present a deterministic data structure that maintains exact distances with
total update time $\tilde{O}(n^3)$. We also present a deterministic data structure that maintains
$(1+\epsilon)$-approximate distance estimates with total update time $\tilde O(\sqrt{m} n^2/\epsilon)$
which for sparse graphs is $\tilde O(n^{2+1/2}/\epsilon)$. Finally, we present a randomized $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate
data structure which works against an adaptive adversary; its total update time is $\tilde O(m^{2/3}n^{5/3}
+ n^{8/3}/(m^{1/3}\epsilon^2))$ which for sparse graphs is $\tilde O(n^{2+1/3})$. Our exact
data structure matches the total update time of the best randomized data structure by Baswana et
al. [STOC'02] and maintains the distance matrix in near-optimal time. Our approximate data structures
improve upon the best data structures against an adaptive adversary which have $\tilde{O}(mn^2)$
total update time [JACM'81, STOC'03].

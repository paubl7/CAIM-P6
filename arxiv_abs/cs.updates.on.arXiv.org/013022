The purpose of this paper is to design a solution to the problem of facial recognition by use of convolutional
neural networks, with the intention of applying the solution in a camera-based home-entry access
control system. More specifically, the paper focuses on solving the supervised classification
problem of taking images of people as input and classifying the person in the image as one of the authors
or not. Two approaches are proposed: (1) building and training a neural network called WoodNet from
scratch and (2) leveraging transfer learning by utilizing a network pre-trained on the ImageNet
database and adapting it to this project's data and classes. In order to train the models to recognize
the authors, a dataset containing more than 150 000 images has been created, balanced over the authors
and others. Image extraction from videos and image augmentation techniques were instrumental
for dataset creation. The results are two models classifying the individuals in the dataset with
high accuracy, achieving over 99% accuracy on held-out test data. The pre-trained model fitted
significantly faster than WoodNet, and seems to generalize better. However, these results come
with a few caveats. Because of the way the dataset was compiled, as well as the high accuracy, one has
reason to believe the models over-fitted to the data to some degree. An added consequence of the data
compilation method is that the test dataset may not be sufficiently different from the training
data, limiting its ability to validate generalization of the models. However, utilizing the models
in a web-cam based system, classifying faces in real-time, shows promising results and indicates
that the models generalized fairly well for at least some of the classes (see the accompanying video).

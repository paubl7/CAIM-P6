Clustering genotypes based upon their phenotypic characteristics is used to obtain diverse sets
of parents that are useful in their breeding programs. The Hierarchical Clustering (HC) algorithm
is the current standard in clustering of phenotypic data. This algorithm suffers from low accuracy
and high computational complexity issues. To address the accuracy challenge, we propose the use
of Spectral Clustering (SC) algorithm. To make the algorithm computationally cheap, we propose
using sampling, specifically, Pivotal Sampling that is probability based. Since application
of samplings to phenotypic data has not been explored much, for effective comparison, another sampling
technique called Vector Quantization (VQ) is adapted for this data as well. VQ has recently given
promising results for genome data. The novelty of our SC with Pivotal Sampling algorithm is in constructing
the crucial similarity matrix for the clustering algorithm and defining probabilities for the
sampling technique. Although our algorithm can be applied to any plant genotypes, we test it on the
phenotypic data obtained from about 2400 Soybean genotypes. SC with Pivotal Sampling achieves
substantially more accuracy (in terms of Silhouette Values) than all the other proposed competitive
clustering with sampling algorithms (i.e. SC with VQ, HC with Pivotal Sampling, and HC with VQ).
The complexities of our SC with Pivotal Sampling algorithm and these three variants are almost same
because of the involved sampling. In addition to this, SC with Pivotal Sampling outperforms the
standard HC algorithm in both accuracy and computational complexity. We experimentally show that
we are up to 45% more accurate than HC in terms of clustering accuracy. The computational complexity
of our algorithm is more than a magnitude lesser than HC.

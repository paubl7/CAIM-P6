The purpose of the study presented herein is to develop a machine learning algorithm based on natural
language processing that automatically detects whether a patient has a cardiac failure or a healthy
condition by using physician notes in Research Data Warehouse at CHU Sainte Justine Hospital. First,
a word representation learning technique was employed by using bag-of-word (BoW), term frequency
inverse document frequency (TFIDF), and neural word embeddings (word2vec). Each representation
technique aims to retain the words semantic and syntactic analysis in critical care data. It helps
to enrich the mutual information for the word representation and leads to an advantage for further
appropriate analysis steps. Second, a machine learning classifier was used to detect the patients
condition for either cardiac failure or stable patient through the created word representation
vector space from the previous step. This machine learning approach is based on a supervised binary
classification algorithm, including logistic regression (LR), Gaussian Naive-Bayes (GaussianNB),
and multilayer perceptron neural network (MLPNN). Technically, it mainly optimizes the empirical
loss during training the classifiers. As a result, an automatic learning algorithm would be accomplished
to draw a high classification performance, including accuracy (acc), precision (pre), recall
(rec), and F1 score (f1). The results show that the combination of TFIDF and MLPNN always outperformed
other combinations with all overall performance. In the case without any feature selection, the
proposed framework yielded an overall classification performance with acc, pre, rec, and f1 of
84% and 82%, 85%, and 83%, respectively. Significantly, if the feature selection was well applied,
the overall performance would finally improve up to 4% for each evaluation.

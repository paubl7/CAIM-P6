Electronic Health Record (EHR) data has been of tremendous utility in Artificial Intelligence
(AI) for healthcare such as predicting future clinical events. These tasks, however, often come
with many challenges when using classical machine learning models due to a myriad of factors including
class imbalance and data heterogeneity (i.e., the complex intra-class variances). To address
some of these research gaps, this paper leverages the exciting contrastive learning framework
and proposes a novel contrastive regularized clinical classification model. The contrastive
loss is found to substantially augment EHR-based prediction: it effectively characterizes the
similar/dissimilar patterns (by its "push-and-pull" form), meanwhile mitigating the highly
skewed class distribution by learning more balanced feature spaces (as also echoed by recent findings).
In particular, when naively exporting the contrastive learning to the EHR data, one hurdle is in
generating positive samples, since EHR data is not as amendable to data augmentation as image data.
To this end, we have introduced two unique positive sampling strategies specifically tailored
for EHR data: a feature-based positive sampling that exploits the feature space neighborhood structure
to reinforce the feature learning; and an attribute-based positive sampling that incorporates
pre-generated patient similarity metrics to define the sample proximity. Both sampling approaches
are designed with an awareness of unique high intra-class variance in EHR data. Our overall framework
yields highly competitive experimental results in predicting the mortality risk on real-world
COVID-19 EHR data with a total of 5,712 patients admitted to a large, urban health system. Specifically,
our method reaches a high AUROC prediction score of 0.959, which outperforms other baselines and
alternatives: cross-entropy(0.873) and focal loss(0.931).

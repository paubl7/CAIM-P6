By the aid of attention mechanisms to weight the image features adaptively, recent advanced deep
learning-based models encourage the predicted results to approximate the ground-truth masks
with as large predictable areas as possible, thus achieving the state-of-the-art performance.
However, these methods do not pay enough attention to small areas prone to misprediction. In this
way, it is still tough to accurately locate salient objects due to the existence of regions with indistinguishable
foreground and background and regions with complex or fine structures. To address these problems,
we propose a novel convolutional neural network with purificatory mechanism and structural similarity
loss. Specifically, in order to better locate preliminary salient objects, we first introduce
the promotion attention, which is based on spatial and channel attention mechanisms to promote
attention to salient regions. Subsequently, for the purpose of restoring the indistinguishable
regions that can be regarded as error-prone regions of one model, we propose the rectification attention,
which is learned from the areas of wrong prediction and guide the network to focus on error-prone
regions thus rectifying errors. Through these two attentions, we use the Purificatory Mechanism
to impose strict weights with different regions of the whole salient objects and purify results
from hard-to-distinguish regions, thus accurately predicting the locations and details of salient
objects. In addition to paying different attention to these hard-to-distinguish regions, we also
consider the structural constraints on complex regions and propose the Structural Similarity
Loss. In experiments, the proposed approach outperforms 19 state-of-the-art methods on six datasets
with a notable margin at over 27FPS on a single NVIDIA 1080Ti GPU.

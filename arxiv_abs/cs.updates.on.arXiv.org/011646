Context: Little is known of the problems faced by game developers. However, game developers do share
information about their games projects through postmortems, which describe informally what happened
during the projects. Objective: The software-engineering research community and game developers
would benefit from a state of the problems of video game development, in particular the problems
faced by game developers, their evolution in time, and their root causes. This state of the practice
would allow researchers and practitioners to work towards solving these problems. Method: We analyzed
more than 200 postmortems, comprising 927 problems divided in 20 types from 1997 to 2019. Through
our analysis, we describe the overall landscape of game industry problems in the past 23 years and
how these problems evolved over the years. We also give details on the most common problems, their
root causes, and possible solutions. We finally provide recommendations for future projects.
Results: We observe that (1) the game industry suffer from management and production problems in
the same proportion; (2) management problems decreased over the years giving space to business
problems, while production problems remained constant; (3a) technical and game design problems
are decreasing over the years, the later only after the last decade; (3b) problems related to the
team increase over the last decade; (3c) marketing problems are the ones that had the biggest increase
over the 23 years compared to other problem types; (4) finally, the majority of the main root causes
are related to people, not technologies. Conclusions: In this paper we provide a state of the practice
for researchers to understand and study video-game development problems. We also offer recommendations
to help practitioners to avoid the most common problems in future projects.

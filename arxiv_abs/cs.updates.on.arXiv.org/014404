Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) intend to improve significantly the performance
of future wireless networks, by controlling the wireless propagation medium through elements
that can shift the phase of the reflected signals. Although ideally the signals reflected from a
RIS are added coherently at the receiver, this is very challenging in practice due to the requirement
for perfect channel state information (CSI) at the RIS and phase control. To facilitate the performance
analysis of more practical RIS-assisted systems, first, we present novel closed-form expressions
for the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function, the moments, and
the characteristic function of the distribution of the sum of double-Nakagami-m random vectors,
whose amplitudes follow the double-Nakagami-m distribution, i.e., the distribution of the product
of two random variables following the Nakagami-m distribution, and phases are circular uniformly
distributed. We also consider a special case of this distribution, namely the distribution of the
sum of Rayleigh-Nakagami-m random vectors. Then, we exploit these expressions to investigate
the performance of the RIS-assisted composite channel, assuming that the two links undergo Nakagami-m
fading and the equivalent phase follows the uniform distribution, which corresponds to the case
where CSI is not available at the RIS and leads to a lower bound of the performance of a system with CSI.
Closed-form expressions for the outage probability, the average received signal-to-noise ratio,
the ergodic capacity, the bit error probability, the amount of fading, and the channel quality estimation
index are provided to evaluate the performance of the considered system. These metrics are also
derived for the practical special case where one of the two links undergoes Rayleigh fading.

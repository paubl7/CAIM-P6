In a temporal network with discrete time-labels on its edges, entities and information can only
"flow" along sequences of edges whose time-labels are non-decreasing (resp. increasing), i.e.
along temporal (resp. strict temporal) paths. Nevertheless, in the model for temporal networks
of [Kempe et al., JCSS, 2002], the individual time-labeled edges remain undirected: an edge $e=\{u,v\}$
with time-label $t$ specifies that "$u$ communicates with $v$ at time $t$". This is a symmetric relation
between $u$ and $v$, and it can be interpreted that the information can flow in either direction.
In this paper we make a first attempt to understand how the direction of information flow on one edge
can impact the direction of information flow on other edges. More specifically, we introduce the
notion of a temporal transitive orientation and we systematically investigate its algorithmic
behavior in various situations. An orientation of a temporal graph is called temporally transitive
if, whenever $u$ has a directed edge towards $v$ with time-label $t_1$ and $v$ has a directed edge
towards $w$ with time-label $t_2\geq t_1$, then $u$ also has a directed edge towards $w$ with some
time-label $t_3\geq t_2$. If we just demand that this implication holds whenever $t_2 > t_1$, the
orientation is called strictly temporally transitive. Our main result is a conceptually simple,
yet technically quite involved, polynomial-time algorithm for recognizing whether a given temporal
graph $\mathcal{G}$ is transitively orientable. In wide contrast we prove that, surprisingly,
it is NP-hard to recognize whether $\mathcal{G}$ is strictly transitively orientable. Additionally
we introduce and investigate further related problems to temporal transitivity, notably among
them the temporal transitive completion problem, for which we prove both algorithmic and hardness
results.

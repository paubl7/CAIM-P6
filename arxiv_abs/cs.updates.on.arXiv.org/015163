Ethereum smart contracts are automated decentralized applications on the blockchain that describe
the terms of the agreement between buyers and sellers, reducing the need for trusted intermediaries
and arbitration. However, the deployment of smart contracts introduces new attack vectors into
the cryptocurrency systems. In particular, programming flaws in smart contracts can be and have
already been exploited to gain enormous financial profits. It is thus an emerging yet crucial issue
to detect vulnerabilities of different classes in contracts in an efficient manner. Existing machine
learning-based vulnerability detection methods are limited and only inspect whether the smart
contract is vulnerable, or train individual classifiers for each specific vulnerability, or demonstrate
multi-class vulnerability detection without extensibility consideration. To overcome the scalability
and generalization limitations of existing works, we propose ESCORT, the first Deep Neural Network
(DNN)-based vulnerability detection framework for Ethereum smart contracts that support lightweight
transfer learning on unseen security vulnerabilities, thus is extensible and generalizable.
ESCORT leverages a multi-output NN architecture that consists of two parts: (i) A common feature
extractor that learns the semantics of the input contract; (ii) Multiple branch structures where
each branch learns a specific vulnerability type based on features obtained from the feature extractor.
Experimental results show that ESCORT achieves an average F1-score of 95% on six vulnerability
types and the detection time is 0.02 seconds per contract. When extended to new vulnerability types,
ESCORT yields an average F1-score of 93%. To the best of our knowledge, ESCORT is the first framework
that enables transfer learning on new vulnerability types with minimal modification of the DNN
model architecture and re-training overhead.

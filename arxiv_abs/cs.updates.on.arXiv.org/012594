In this paper, we collect and study Twitter communications to understand the societal impact of
COVID-19 in the United States during the early days of the pandemic. With infections soaring rapidly,
users took to Twitter asking people to self isolate and quarantine themselves. Users also demanded
closure of schools, bars, and restaurants as well as lockdown of cities and states. We methodically
collect tweets by identifying and tracking trending COVID-related hashtags. We first manually
group the hashtags into six main categories, namely, 1) General COVID, 2) Quarantine, 3) Panic Buying,
4) School Closures, 5) Lockdowns, and 6) Frustration and Hope}, and study the temporal evolution
of tweets in these hashtags. We conduct a linguistic analysis of words common to all hashtag groups
and specific to each hashtag group and identify the chief concerns of people as the pandemic gripped
the nation (e.g., exploring bidets as an alternative to toilet paper). We conduct sentiment analysis
and our investigation reveals that people reacted positively to school closures and negatively
to the lack of availability of essential goods due to panic buying. We adopt a state-of-the-art semantic
role labeling approach to identify the action words and then leverage a LSTM-based dependency parsing
model to analyze the context of action words (e.g., verb deal is accompanied by nouns such as anxiety,
stress, and crisis). Finally, we develop a scalable seeded topic modeling approach to automatically
categorize and isolate tweets into hashtag groups and experimentally validate that our topic model
provides a grouping similar to our manual grouping. Our study presents a systematic way to construct
an aggregated picture of peoples' response to the pandemic and lays the groundwork for future fine-grained
linguistic and behavioral analysis.

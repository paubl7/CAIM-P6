Gesture recognition is a much studied research area which has myriad real-world applications including
robotics and human-machine interaction. Current gesture recognition methods have focused on
recognising isolated gestures, and existing continuous gesture recognition methods are limited
to two-stage approaches where independent models are required for detection and classification,
with the performance of the latter being constrained by detection performance. In contrast, we
introduce a single-stage continuous gesture recognition framework, called Temporal Multi-Modal
Fusion (TMMF), that can detect and classify multiple gestures in a video via a single model. This
approach learns the natural transitions between gestures and non-gestures without the need for
a pre-processing segmentation step to detect individual gestures. To achieve this, we introduce
a multi-modal fusion mechanism to support the integration of important information that flows
from multi-modal inputs, and is scalable to any number of modes. Additionally, we propose Unimodal
Feature Mapping (UFM) and Multi-modal Feature Mapping (MFM) models to map uni-modal features and
the fused multi-modal features respectively. To further enhance performance, we propose a mid-point
based loss function that encourages smooth alignment between the ground truth and the prediction,
helping the model to learn natural gesture transitions. We demonstrate the utility of our proposed
framework, which can handle variable-length input videos, and outperforms the state-of-the-art
on three challenging datasets: EgoGesture, IPN hand, and ChaLearn LAP Continuous Gesture Dataset
(ConGD). Furthermore, ablation experiments show the importance of different components of the
proposed framework.

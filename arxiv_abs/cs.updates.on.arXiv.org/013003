The effects of the so-called "refugee crisis" of 2015-16 continue to dominate the political agenda
in Europe. Migration flows were sudden and unexpected, leaving governments unprepared and exposing
significant shortcomings in the field of migration forecasting. Migration is a complex system
typified by episodic variation, underpinned by causal factors that are interacting, highly context
dependent and short-lived. Correspondingly, migration monitoring relies on scattered data,
while approaches to forecasting focus on specific migration flows and often have inconsistent
results that are difficult to generalise at the regional or global levels. Here we show that adaptive
machine learning algorithms that integrate official statistics and non-traditional data sources
at scale can effectively forecast asylum-related migration flows. We focus on asylum applications
lodged in countries of the European Union (EU) by nationals of all countries of origin worldwide;
the same approach can be applied in any context provided adequate migration or asylum data are available.
We exploit three tiers of data - geolocated events and internet searches in countries of origin,
detections of irregular crossings at the EU border, and asylum recognition rates in countries of
destination - to effectively forecast individual asylum-migration flows up to four weeks ahead
with high accuracy. Uniquely, our approach a) monitors potential drivers of migration in countries
of origin to detect changes early onset; b) models individual country-to-country migration flows
separately and on moving time windows; c) estimates the effects of individual drivers, including
lagged effects; d) provides forecasts of asylum applications up to four weeks ahead; e) assesses
how patterns of drivers shift over time to describe the functioning and change of migration systems.

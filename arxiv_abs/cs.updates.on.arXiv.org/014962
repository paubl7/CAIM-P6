Trust in a recommendation system (RS) is often algorithmically incorporated using implicit or
explicit feedback of user-perceived trustworthy social neighbors, and evaluated using user-reported
trustworthiness of recommended items. However, real-life recommendation settings can feature
group disparities in trust, power, and prerogatives. Our study examines a complementary view of
trust which relies on the editorial power relationships and attitudes of all stakeholders in the
RS application domain. We devise a simple, first-principles metric of editorial authority, i.e.,
user preferences for recommendation sourcing, veto power, and incorporating user feedback, such
that one RS user group confers trust upon another by ceding or assigning editorial authority. In
a mixed-methods study at Virginia Tech, we surveyed faculty, teaching assistants, and students
about their preferences of editorial authority, and hypothesis-tested its relationship with
trust in algorithms for a hypothetical `Suggested Readings' RS. We discover that higher RS editorial
authority assigned to students is linked to the relative trust the course staff allocates to RS algorithm
and students. We also observe that course staff favors higher control for the RS algorithm in sourcing
and updating the recommendations long-term. Using content analysis, we discuss frequent staff-recommended
student editorial roles and highlight their frequent rationales, such as perceived expertise,
scaling the learning environment, professional curriculum needs, and learner disengagement.
We argue that our analyses highlight critical user preferences to help detect editorial power asymmetry
and identify RS use-cases for supporting teaching and research

Single-stage object detectors have been widely applied in computer vision applications due to
their high efficiency. However, we find that the loss functions adopted by single-stage object
detectors hurt the localization accuracy seriously. Firstly, the standard cross-entropy loss
for classification is independent of the localization task and drives all the positive examples
to learn as high classification scores as possible regardless of localization accuracy during
training. As a result, there will be many detections that have high classification scores but low
IoU or detections that have low classification scores but high IoU. Secondly, for the standard smooth
L1 loss, the gradient is dominated by the outliers that have poor localization accuracy during training.
The above two problems will decrease the localization accuracy of single-stage detectors. In this
work, IoU-balanced loss functions that consist of IoU-balanced classification loss and IoU-balanced
localization loss are proposed to solve the above problems. The IoU-balanced classification loss
pays more attention to positive examples with high IoU and can enhance the correlation between classification
and localization tasks. The IoU-balanced localization loss decreases the gradient of examples
with low IoU and increases the gradient of examples with high IoU, which can improve the localization
accuracy of models. Extensive experiments on challenging public datasets such as MS COCO, PASCAL
VOC and Cityscapes demonstrate that both IoU-balanced losses can bring substantial improvement
for the popular single-stage detectors, especially for the localization accuracy. On COCO test-dev,
the proposed methods can substantially improve AP by $1.0\%\sim1.7\%$ and AP75 by $1.0\%\sim2.4\%$.
On PASCAL VOC, it can also substantially improve AP by $1.3\%\sim1.5\%$ and AP80, AP90 by $1.6\%\sim3.9\%$.

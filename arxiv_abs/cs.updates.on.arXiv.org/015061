In this paper we present improved bounds for approximating maximum matchings in bipartite graphs
in the streaming model. First, we consider the question of how well maximum matching can be approximated
in a single pass over the input using $\tilde O(n)$ space, where $n$ is the number of vertices in the
input graph. Two natural variants of this problem have been considered in the literature: (1) the
edge arrival setting, where edges arrive in the stream and (2) the vertex arrival setting, where
vertices on one side of the graph arrive in the stream together with all their incident edges. The
latter setting has also been studied extensively in the context of online algorithms, where each
arriving vertex has to either be matched irrevocably or discarded upon arrival. In the online setting,
the celebrated algorithm of Karp-Vazirani-Vazirani achieves a $1-1/e$ approximation. Despite
the fact that the streaming model is less restrictive in that the algorithm is not constrained to
match vertices irrevocably upon arrival, the best known approximation in the streaming model with
vertex arrivals and $\tilde O(n)$ space is the same factor of $1-1/e$. We show that no single pass
streaming algorithm that uses $\tilde O(n)$ space can achieve a better than $1-1/e$ approximation
to maximum matching, even in the vertex arrival setting. This leads to the striking conclusion that
no single pass streaming algorithm can do better than online algorithms unless it uses significantly
more than $\tilde O(n)$ space. Additionally, our bound yields the best known impossibility result
for approximating matchings in the edge arrival model. We also give a simple algorithm that achieves
approximation ratio $1-e^{-k}k^{k-1}/(k-1)!=1-\frac1{\sqrt{2\pi k}}+o(1/k)$ in $k$ passes
in the vertex arrival model using linear space, improving upon previously best known convergence.

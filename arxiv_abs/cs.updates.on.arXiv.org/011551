A femtosecond laser is a powerful tool for micromachining of silicon. In this work, large-area laser
ablation of crystalline silicon is comprehensively studied using a laser source of pulse width
300 fs at two wavelengths of 343 nm and 1030 nm. We develop a unique approach to gain insight into the
laser milling process by means of detailed analysis of trenches. Laser scribed trenches and milled
areas are characterized using optical profilometry to extract dimensional and roughness parameters
with accuracy and repeatability. In a first step, multiple measures of the trench including the
average depth, the volume of recast material, the average longitudinal profile roughness, the
inner trench width and the volume removal rate are studied. This allows for delineation of ablation
regimes and associated characteristics allowing to determine the impact of fluence and repetition
rate on laser milling. In a second step, additional factors of debris formation and material redeposition
that come into play during laser milling are further elucidated. These results are utilized for
processing large-area (up to few mm2) with milling depths up to 200 {\mu}m to enable the fabrication
of cavities with low surface roughness at high removal rates of up to 6.9 {\mu}m3 {\mu}s-1. Finally,
laser processing in combination with XeF2 etching is applied on SOI-CMOS technology in the fabrication
of radio-frequency (RF) functions standing on suspended membranes. Performance is considerably
improved on different functions like RF switch (23 dB improvement in 2nd harmonic), inductors (near
doubling of Q-factor) and LNA (noise figure improvement of 0.1 dB) demonstrating the applicability
of milling to radio-frequency applications.

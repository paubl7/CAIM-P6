Autonomous driving systems are set to become a reality in transport systems and, so, maximum acceptance
is being sought among users. Currently, the most advanced architectures require driver intervention
when functional system failures or critical sensor operations take place, presenting problems
related to driver state, distractions, fatigue, and other factors that prevent safe control. Therefore,
this work presents a redundant, accurate, robust, and scalable LiDAR odometry system with fail-aware
system features that can allow other systems to perform a safe stop manoeuvre without driver mediation.
All odometry systems have drift error, making it difficult to use them for localisation tasks over
extended periods. For this reason, the paper presents an accurate LiDAR odometry system with a fail-aware
indicator. This indicator estimates a time window in which the system manages the localisation
tasks appropriately. The odometry error is minimised by applying a dynamic 6-DoF model and fusing
measures based on the Iterative Closest Points (ICP), environment feature extraction, and Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD) methods. The obtained results are promising for two reasons: First,
in the KITTI odometry data set, the ranking achieved by the proposed method is twelfth, considering
only LiDAR-based methods, where its translation and rotation errors are 1.00% and 0.0041 deg/m,
respectively. Second, the encouraging results of the fail-aware indicator demonstrate the safety
of the proposed LiDAR odometry system. The results depict that, in order to achieve an accurate odometry
system, complex models and measurement fusion techniques must be used to improve its behaviour.
Furthermore, if an odometry system is to be used for redundant localisation features, it must integrate
a fail-aware indicator for use in a safe manner.

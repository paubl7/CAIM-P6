Most power systems are increasingly based on distributed energy resources, leading to a strong
impact on the electrical grid management. In the case of Portugal, the contribution of renewable
energy sources to the electricity generation portfolio is already high and the objective is to achieve
100% by 2050. Most of the new renewable generation capacity will be ensured by distributed photovoltaic
generation installed in buildings and therefore the inherent intermittence of photovoltaic output
combined with a mismatch with demand profile will challenge the operation and resiliency of the
electrical grid. Addressing these issues requires management at the community level and the leveraging
of spatio-temporal flexibility of controllable energy resources, such as energy storage resources.
This is recognized by the regulators in Portugal and the recent renewable generation self-consumption
legislation enables generation-surplus trading in communities. Implementing intra-community
trading and utilizing the potentials of renewable generation requires oversight and coordination
at the community level in the context of transactive energy systems. This paper focuses on addressing
energy sharing through a transactive energy market in community microgrids, using stationary
and mobile energy storage as flexibility resources. The proposed framework considers public and
commercial buildings with on-site battery storage and numerous electric vehicle charging stations.
The formulation is assessed using real data from a community of buildings on a Portuguese University
campus. The results showcase that the proposed method achieves an increase in renewable self-consumption
at building and community levels, as well as a reduction in electricity costs.

Recently, tremendous interest has been devoted to develop data fusion strategies for energy efficiency
in buildings, where various kinds of information can be processed. However, applying the appropriate
data fusion strategy to design an efficient energy efficiency system is not straightforward; it
requires a priori knowledge of existing fusion strategies, their applications and their properties.
To this regard, seeking to provide the energy research community with a better understanding of
data fusion strategies in building energy saving systems, their principles, advantages, and potential
applications, this paper proposes an extensive survey of existing data fusion mechanisms deployed
to reduce excessive consumption and promote sustainability. We investigate their conceptualizations,
advantages, challenges and drawbacks, as well as performing a taxonomy of existing data fusion
strategies and other contributing factors. Following, a comprehensive comparison of the state-of-the-art
data fusion based energy efficiency frameworks is conducted using various parameters, including
data fusion level, data fusion techniques, behavioral change influencer, behavioral change incentive,
recorded data, platform architecture, IoT technology and application scenario. Moreover, a novel
method for electrical appliance identification is proposed based on the fusion of 2D local texture
descriptors, where 1D power signals are transformed into 2D space and treated as images. The empirical
evaluation, conducted on three real datasets, shows promising performance, in which up to 99.68%
accuracy and 99.52% F1 score have been attained. In addition, various open research challenges
and future orientations to improve data fusion based energy efficiency ecosystems are explored.

In this paper, we propose a real-time and accurate automatic license plate recognition (ALPR) approach.
Our study illustrates the outstanding design of ALPR with four insights: (1) the resampling-based
cascaded framework is beneficial to both speed and accuracy; (2) the highly efficient license plate
recognition should abundant additional character segmentation and recurrent neural network
(RNN), but adopt a plain convolutional neural network (CNN); (3) in the case of CNN, taking advantage
of vertex information on license plates improves the recognition performance; and (4) the weight-sharing
character classifier addresses the lack of training images in small-scale datasets. Based on these
insights, we propose a novel ALPR approach, termed VSNet. Specifically, VSNet includes two CNNs,
i.e., VertexNet for license plate detection and SCR-Net for license plate recognition, integrated
in a resampling-based cascaded manner. In VertexNet, we propose an efficient integration block
to extract the spatial features of license plates. With vertex supervisory information, we propose
a vertex-estimation branch in VertexNet such that license plates can be rectified as the input images
of SCR-Net. In SCR-Net, we introduce a horizontal encoding technique for left-to-right feature
extraction and propose a weight-sharing classifier for character recognition. Experimental
results show that the proposed VSNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods by more than 50% relative
improvement on error rate, achieving > 99% recognition accuracy on CCPD and AOLP datasets with 149
FPS inference speed. Moreover, our method illustrates an outstanding generalization capability
when evaluated on the unseen PKUData and CLPD datasets.

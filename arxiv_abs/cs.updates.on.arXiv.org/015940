Fashion trend forecasting is of great research significance in providing useful suggestions for
both fashion companies and fashion lovers. Although various studies have been devoted to tackling
this challenging task, they only studied limited fashion elements with highly seasonal or simple
patterns, which could hardly reveal the real complex fashion trends. Moreover, the mainstream
solutions for this task are still statistical-based and solely focus on time-series data modeling,
which limit the forecast accuracy. Towards insightful fashion trend forecasting, previous work
[1] proposed to analyze more fine-grained fashion elements which can informatively reveal fashion
trends. Specifically, it focused on detailed fashion element trend forecasting for specific user
groups based on social media data. In addition, it proposed a neural network-based method, namely
KERN, to address the problem of fashion trend modeling and forecasting. In this work, to extend the
previous work, we propose an improved model named Relation Enhanced Attention Recurrent (REAR)
network. Compared to KERN, the REAR model leverages not only the relations among fashion elements
but also those among user groups, thus capturing more types of correlations among various fashion
trends. To further improve the performance of long-range trend forecasting, the REAR method devises
a sliding temporal attention mechanism, which is able to capture temporal patterns on future horizons
better. Extensive experiments and more analysis have been conducted on the FIT and GeoStyle datasets
to evaluate the performance of REAR. Experimental and analytical results demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed REAR model in fashion trend forecasting, which also show the improvement of REAR
compared to the KERN.

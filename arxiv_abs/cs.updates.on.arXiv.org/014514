Many animals meander in environments and avoid collisions. How the underlying neuronal machinery
can yield robust behaviour in a variety of environments remains unclear. In the fly brain, motion-sensitive
neurons indicate the presence of nearby objects and directional cues are integrated within an area
known as the central complex. Such neuronal machinery, in contrast with the traditional stream-based
approach to signal processing, uses an event-based approach, with events occurring when changes
are sensed by the animal. Contrary to von Neumann computing architectures, event-based neuromorphic
hardware is designed to process information in an asynchronous and distributed manner. Inspired
by the fly brain, we model, for the first time, a neuromorphic closed-loop system mimicking essential
behaviours observed in flying insects, such as meandering in clutter and gap crossing, which are
highly relevant for autonomous vehicles. We implemented our system both in software and on neuromorphic
hardware. While moving through an environment, our agent perceives changes in its surroundings
and uses this information for collision avoidance. The agent's manoeuvres result from a closed
action-perception loop implementing probabilistic decision-making processes. This loop-closure
is thought to have driven the development of neural circuitry in biological agents since the Cambrian
explosion. In the fundamental quest to understand neural computation in artificial agents, we
come closer to understanding and modelling biological intelligence by closing the loop also in
neuromorphic systems. As a closed-loop system, our system deepens our understanding of processing
in neural networks and computations in biological and artificial systems. With these investigations,
we aim to set the foundations for neuromorphic intelligence in the future, moving towards leveraging
the full potential of neuromorphic systems.

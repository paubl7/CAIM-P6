The early detection of cancer is a challenging problem in medicine. The blood sera of cancer patients
are enriched with heterogeneous secretory lipid bound extracellular vesicles (EVs), which present
a complex repertoire of information and biomarkers, representing their cell of origin, that are
being currently studied in the field of liquid biopsy and cancer screening. Vibrational spectroscopies
provide non-invasive approaches for the assessment of structural and biophysical properties
in complex biological samples. In this study, multiple Raman spectroscopy measurements were performed
on the EVs extracted from the blood sera of 9 patients consisting of four different cancer subtypes
(colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, breast cancer and pancreatic cancer) and five
healthy patients (controls). FTIR(Fourier Transform Infrared) spectroscopy measurements were
performed as a complementary approach to Raman analysis, on two of the four cancer subtypes. The
AdaBoost Random Forest Classifier, Decision Trees, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) distinguished
the baseline corrected Raman spectra of cancer EVs from those of healthy controls (18 spectra) with
a classification accuracy of greater than 90% when reduced to a spectral frequency range of 1800
to 1940 inverse cm, and subjected to a 0.5 training/testing split. FTIR classification accuracy
on 14 spectra showed an 80% classification accuracy. Our findings demonstrate that basic machine
learning algorithms are powerful tools to distinguish the complex vibrational spectra of cancer
patient EVs from those of healthy patients. These experimental methods hold promise as valid and
efficient liquid biopsy for machine intelligence-assisted early cancer screening.

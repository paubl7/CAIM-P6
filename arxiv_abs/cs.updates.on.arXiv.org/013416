The pandemic of novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) also known
as COVID-19 has been spreading worldwide, causing rampant loss of lives. Medical imaging such as
computed tomography (CT), X-ray, etc., plays a significant role in diagnosing the patients by presenting
the visual representation of the functioning of the organs. However, for any radiologist analyzing
such scans is a tedious and time-consuming task. The emerging deep learning technologies have displayed
its strength in analyzing such scans to aid in the faster diagnosis of the diseases and viruses such
as COVID-19. In the present article, an automated deep learning based model, COVID-19 hierarchical
segmentation network (CHS-Net) is proposed that functions as a semantic hierarchical segmenter
to identify the COVID-19 infected regions from lungs contour via CT medical imaging. The CHS-Net
is developed with the two cascaded residual attention inception U-Net (RAIU-Net) models where
first generates lungs contour maps and second generates COVID-19 infected regions. RAIU-Net comprises
of a residual inception U-Net model with spectral spatial and depth attention network (SSD), consisting
of contraction and expansion phases of depthwise separable convolutions and hybrid pooling (max
and spectral pooling) to efficiently encode and decode the semantic and varying resolution information.
The CHS-Net is trained with the segmentation loss function that is the weighted average of binary
cross entropy loss and dice loss to penalize false negative and false positive predictions. The
approach is compared with the recently proposed research works on the basis of standard metrics,
it is observed that the proposed approach outperformed the recently proposed approaches and effectively
segments the COVID-19 infected regions in the lungs.

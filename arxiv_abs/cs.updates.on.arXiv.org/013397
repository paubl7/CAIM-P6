The Internet of Underwater Things (IoUT) is an emerging communication ecosystem developed for
connecting underwater objects in maritime and underwater environments. The IoUT technology is
intricately linked with intelligent boats and ships, smart shores and oceans, automatic marine
transportations, positioning and navigation, underwater exploration, disaster prediction
and prevention, as well as with intelligent monitoring and security. The IoUT has an influence at
various scales ranging from a small scientific observatory, to a midsized harbor, and to covering
global oceanic trade. The network architecture of IoUT is intrinsically heterogeneous and should
be sufficiently resilient to operate in harsh environments. This creates major challenges in terms
of underwater communications, whilst relying on limited energy resources. Additionally, the
volume, velocity, and variety of data produced by sensors, hydrophones, and cameras in IoUT is enormous,
giving rise to the concept of Big Marine Data (BMD), which has its own processing challenges. Hence,
conventional data processing techniques will falter, and bespoke Machine Learning (ML) solutions
have to be employed for automatically learning the specific BMD behavior and features facilitating
knowledge extraction and decision support. The motivation of this paper is to comprehensively
survey the IoUT, BMD, and their synthesis. It also aims for exploring the nexus of BMD with ML. We set
out from underwater data collection and then discuss the family of IoUT data communication techniques
with an emphasis on the state-of-the-art research challenges. We then review the suite of ML solutions
suitable for BMD handling and analytics. We treat the subject deductively from an educational perspective,
critically appraising the material surveyed.

Natural memories are associative, declarative and distributed. Symbolic computing memories
resemble natural memories in their declarative character, and information can be stored and recovered
explicitly; however, they lack the associative and distributed properties of natural memories.
Sub-symbolic memories developed within the connectionist or artificial neural networks paradigm
are associative and distributed, but are unable to express symbolic structure and information
cannot be stored and retrieved explicitly; hence, they lack the declarative property. To address
this dilemma, we use Relational-Indeterminate Computing to model associative memory registers
that hold distributed representations of individual objects. This mode of computing has an intrinsic
computing entropy which measures the indeterminacy of representations. This parameter determines
the operational characteristics of the memory. Associative registers are embedded in an architecture
that maps concrete images expressed in modality-specific buffers into abstract representations,
and vice versa, and the memory system as a whole fulfills the three properties of natural memories.
The system has been used to model a visual memory holding the representations of hand-written digits,
and recognition and recall experiments show that there is a range of entropy values, not too low and
not too high, in which associative memory registers have a satisfactory performance. The similarity
between the cue and the object recovered in memory retrieve operations depends on the entropy of
the memory register holding the representation of the corresponding object. The experiments were
implemented in a simulation using a standard computer, but a parallel architecture may be built
where the memory operations would take a very reduced number of computing steps.

We built the largest database for kinship recognition. The data were labeled using a novel clustering
algorithm that used label proposals as side information to guide more accurate clusters. Great
savings in time and human input was had. Statistically, FIW shows enormous gains over its predecessors.
We have several benchmarks in kinship verification, family classification, tri-subject verification,
and large-scale search and retrieval. We also trained CNNs on FIW and deployed the model on the renowned
KinWild I and II to gain SOTA. Most recently, we further augmented FIW with MM. Now, video dynamics,
audio, and text captions can be used in the decision making of kinship recognition systems. We expect
FIW will significantly impact research and reality. Additionally, we tackled the classic problem
of facial landmark localization. A majority of these networks have objectives based on L1 or L2 norms,
which inherit several disadvantages. The locations of landmarks are determined from generated
heatmaps from which predicted landmark locations get penalized without accounting for the spread:
a high scatter corresponds to low confidence and vice-versa. To address this, we introduced an objective
that penalizes for low confidence. Another issue is a dependency on labeled data, which is expensive
to collect and susceptible to error. We addressed both issues by proposing an adversarial training
framework that leverages unlabeled data to improve model performance. Our method claims SOTA on
renowned benchmarks. Furthermore, our model is robust with a reduced size: 1/8 the number of channels
is comparable to SOTA in real-time on a CPU. Finally, we built BFW to serve as a proxy to measure bias
across ethnicity and gender subgroups, allowing us to characterize FR performances per subgroup.
We show performances are non-optimal when a single threshold is used to determine whether sample
pairs are genuine.

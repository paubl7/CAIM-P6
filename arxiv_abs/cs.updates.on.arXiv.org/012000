Background. 3-D Secure 2.0 (3DS 2.0) is an identity federation protocol authenticating the payment
initiator for credit card transactions on the Web. Aim. We aim to quantify the impact of factors used
by 3DS 2.0 in its fraud-detection decision making process. Method. We ran credit card transactions
with two Web sites systematically manipulating the nominal IVs \textsf{machine\_data}, \textsf{value},
\textsf{region}, and \textsf{website}. We measured whether the user was \textsf{challenged}
with an authentication, whether the transaction was \textsf{declined}, and whether the card was
\textsf{blocked} as nominal DVs. Results. While \textsf{website} and \textsf{card} largely
did not show a significant impact on any outcome, \textsf{machine\_data}, \textsf{value} and
\textsf{region} did. A change in \textsf{machine\_data}, \textsf{region} or \textsf{value}
made it 5-7 times as likely to be challenged with password authentication. However, even in a foreign
region with another factor being changed, the overall likelihood of being challenged only reached
$60\%$. When in the card's home region, a transaction will be rarely declined ($< 5\%$ in control,
$40\%$ with one factor changed). However, in a region foreign to the card the system will more likely
decline transactions anyway (about $60\%$) and any change in \textsf{machine\_data} or \textsf{value}
will lead to a near-certain declined transaction. The \textsf{region} was the only significant
predictor for a card being blocked ($\mathsf{OR}=3$). Conclusions. We found that the decisions
to challenge the user with a password authentication, to decline a transaction and to block a card
are governed by different weightings. 3DS 2.0 is most likely to decline transactions, especially
in a foreign region. It is less likely to challenge users with password authentication, even if \textsf{machine\_data}
or \textsf{value} are changed.

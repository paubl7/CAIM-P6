Brain Computer Interface technologies are popular methods of communication between the human
brain and external devices. One of the most popular approaches to BCI is Motor Imagery. In BCI applications,
the ElectroEncephaloGraphy is a very popular measurement for brain dynamics because of its non-invasive
nature. Although there is a high interest in the BCI topic, the performance of existing systems is
still far from ideal, due to the difficulty of performing pattern recognition tasks in EEG signals.
BCI systems are composed of a wide range of components that perform signal pre-processing, feature
extraction and decision making. In this paper, we define a BCI Framework, named Enhanced Fusion
Framework, where we propose three different ideas to improve the existing MI-based BCI frameworks.
Firstly, we include aan additional pre-processing step of the signal: a differentiation of the
EEG signal that makes it time-invariant. Secondly, we add an additional frequency band as feature
for the system and we show its effect on the performance of the system. Finally, we make a profound
study of how to make the final decision in the system. We propose the usage of both up to six types of
different classifiers and a wide range of aggregation functions (including classical aggregations,
Choquet and Sugeno integrals and their extensions and overlap functions) to fuse the information
given by the considered classifiers. We have tested this new system on a dataset of 20 volunteers
performing motor imagery-based brain-computer interface experiments. On this dataset, the new
system achieved a 88.80% of accuracy. We also propose an optimized version of our system that is able
to obtain up to 90,76%. Furthermore, we find that the pair Choquet/Sugeno integrals and overlap
functions are the ones providing the best results.

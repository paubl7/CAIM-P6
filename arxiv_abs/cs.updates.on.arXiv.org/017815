Probabilistic logic programming is a major part of statistical relational artificial intelligence,
where approaches from logic and probability are brought together to reason about and learn from
relational domains in a setting of uncertainty. However, the behaviour of statistical relational
representations across variable domain sizes is complex, and scaling inference and learning to
large domains remains a significant challenge. In recent years, connections have emerged between
domain size dependence, lifted inference and learning from sampled subpopulations. The asymptotic
behaviour of statistical relational representations has come under scrutiny, and projectivity
was investigated as the strongest form of domain-size dependence, in which query marginals are
completely independent of the domain size. In this contribution we show that every probabilistic
logic program under the distribution semantics is asymptotically equivalent to an acyclic probabilistic
logic program consisting only of determinate clauses over probabilistic facts. We conclude that
every probabilistic logic program inducing a projective family of distributions is in fact everywhere
equivalent to a program from this fragment, and we investigate the consequences for the projective
families of distributions expressible by probabilistic logic programs. To facilitate the application
of classical results from finite model theory, we introduce the abstract distribution semantics,
defined as an arbitrary logical theory over probabilistic facts. This bridges the gap to the distribution
semantics underlying probabilistic logic programming. In this representation, determinate
logic programs correspond to quantifier-free theories, making asymptotic quantifier elimination
results available for the setting of probabilistic logic programming. This paper is under consideration
for acceptance in TPLP.

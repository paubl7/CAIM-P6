Community detection, a fundamental task for network analysis, aims to partition a network into
multiple sub-structures to help reveal their latent functions. Community detection has been extensively
studied in and broadly applied to many real-world network problems. Classical approaches to community
detection typically utilize probabilistic graphical models and adopt a variety of prior knowledge
to infer community structures. As the problems that network methods try to solve and the network
data to be analyzed become increasingly more sophisticated, new approaches have also been proposed
and developed, particularly those that utilize deep learning and convert networked data into low
dimensional representation. Despite all the recent advancement, there is still a lack of insightful
understanding of the theoretical and methodological underpinning of community detection, which
will be critically important for future development of the area of network analysis. In this paper,
we develop and present a unified architecture of network community-finding methods to characterize
the state-of-the-art of the field of community detection. Specifically, we provide a comprehensive
review of the existing community detection methods and introduce a new taxonomy that divides the
existing methods into two categories, namely probabilistic graphical model and deep learning.
We then discuss in detail the main idea behind each method in the two categories. Furthermore, to
promote future development of community detection, we release several benchmark datasets from
several problem domains and highlight their applications to various network analysis tasks. We
conclude with discussions of the challenges of the field and suggestions of possible directions
for future research.

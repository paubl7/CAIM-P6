User attributes, such as gender and education, face severe incompleteness in social networks.
In order to make this kind of valuable data usable for downstream tasks like user profiling and personalized
recommendation, attribute inference aims to infer users' missing attribute labels based on observed
data. Recently, variational autoencoder (VAE), an end-to-end deep generative model, has shown
promising performance by handling the problem in a semi-supervised way. However, VAEs can easily
suffer from over-fitting and over-smoothing when applied to attribute inference. To be specific,
VAE implemented with multi-layer perceptron (MLP) can only reconstruct input data but fail in inferring
missing parts. While using the trending graph neural networks (GNNs) as encoder has the problem
that GNNs aggregate redundant information from neighborhood and generate indistinguishable
user representations, which is known as over-smoothing. In this paper, we propose an attribute
\textbf{Infer}ence model based on \textbf{A}dversarial \textbf{VAE} (Infer-AVAE) to cope with
these issues. Specifically, to overcome over-smoothing, Infer-AVAE unifies MLP and GNNs in encoder
to learn positive and negative latent representations respectively. Meanwhile, an adversarial
network is trained to distinguish the two representations and GNNs are trained to aggregate less
noise for more robust representations through adversarial training. Finally, to relieve over-fitting,
mutual information constraint is introduced as a regularizer for decoder, so that it can make better
use of auxiliary information in representations and generate outputs not limited by observations.
We evaluate our model on 4 real-world social network datasets, experimental results demonstrate
that our model averagely outperforms baselines by 7.0$\%$ in accuracy.

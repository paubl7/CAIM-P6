Closed-loop control systems employ continuous sensing and actuation to maintain controlled variables
within preset bounds and achieve the desired system output. Intentional disturbances in the system,
such as in the case of cyberattacks, can compromise reachability of control goals, and in several
cases jeopardize safety. The increasing connectivity and exposure of networked control to external
networks has enabled attackers to compromise these systems by exploiting security vulnerabilities.
Attacks against safety-critical control loops can not only drive the system over a trajectory different
from the desired, but also cause fatal consequences to humans. In this paper we present a physics-based
Intrusion Detection System (IDS) aimed at increasing the security in control systems. In addition
to conventional process state estimation for intrusion detection, since the controller cannot
be trusted, we introduce a controller state estimator. Additionally, we make our detector context-aware
by utilizing sensor measurements from other control loops, which allows to distinguish and characterize
disturbances from attacks. We introduce adaptive thresholding and adaptive filtering as means
to achieve context-awareness. Together, these methodologies allow detection and localization
of attacks in closed-loop controls. Finally, we demonstrate feasibility of the approach by mounting
a series of attacks against a networked Direct Current (DC) motor closed-loop speed control deployed
on an ECU testbed, as well as on a simulated automated lane keeping system. Among other application
domains, this set of approaches is key to support security in automotive systems, and ultimately
increase road and passenger safety.

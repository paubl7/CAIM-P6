Deep learning (DL) algorithms are the state of the art in automated classification of wildlife camera
trap images. The challenge is that the ecologist cannot know in advance how many images per species
they need to collect for model training in order to achieve their desired classification accuracy.
In fact there is limited empirical evidence in the context of camera trapping to demonstrate that
increasing sample size will lead to improved accuracy. In this study we explore in depth the issues
of deep learning model performance for progressively increasing per class (species) sample sizes.
We also provide ecologists with an approximation formula to estimate how many images per animal
species they need for certain accuracy level a priori. This will help ecologists for optimal allocation
of resources, work and efficient study design. In order to investigate the effect of number of training
images; seven training sets with 10, 20, 50, 150, 500, 1000 images per class were designed. Six deep
learning architectures namely ResNet-18, ResNet-50, ResNet-152, DnsNet-121, DnsNet-161, and
DnsNet-201 were trained and tested on a common exclusive testing set of 250 images per class. The
whole experiment was repeated on three similar datasets from Australia, Africa and North America
and the results were compared. Simple regression equations for use by practitioners to approximate
model performance metrics are provided. Generalized additive models (GAM) are shown to be effective
in modelling DL performance metrics based on the number of training images per class, tuning scheme
and dataset. Key-words: Camera Traps, Deep Learning, Ecological Informatics, Generalised Additive

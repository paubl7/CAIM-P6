We discuss and compare complexity measures for the modal $\mu$-calculus, focusing on size and alternation
depth. As a yardstick we take Wilke's alternating tree automata, which we shall call parity formulas
in the text. Building on work by Bruse, Friedmann & Lange, we compare two size measures for $\mu$-calculus
formulas: subformula-size,i.e. , the number of subformulas of the given formula, and closure-size.
These notions correspond to the representation of a formula as a parity formula based on, respectively,
its subformula dag, and its closure graph. What distinguishes our approach is that we are explicit
about the role of alpha-equivalence, as naively renaming bound variables can lead to an exponential
blow-up. In addition, we match the formula's alternation depth with the index of the parity formula.
We start in a setting without alpha-equivalence. We define subformula-size and closure-size and
recall that a $\mu$-calculus formula can be transformed into a parity formula of size linear wrt
subformula size, and give a construction that transforms a $\mu$-calculus formula into an equivalent
parity formula linear wrt closure-size. Conversely, there is a standard transformation producing
a $\mu$-calculus formula of exponential subformula -- but linear closure-size in terms of the size
of the original parity formula. We identify so-called untwisted parity formulas for which a transformation
linear in subformula-size exists. We then introduce size notions that are completely invariant
under alpha equivalence. We transfer the result of Bruse et alii, showing that also in our setting
closure-size can be exponentially smaller than subformula-size. We also show how to rename bound
variables so that alpha-equivalence becomes syntactic identity on the closure set. Finally, we
review the complexity of guarded transformations.

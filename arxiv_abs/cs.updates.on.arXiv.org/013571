Knowledge is the most precious asset of humankind. People extract the experience from the data that
provide for us the reality through the feelings. Generally speaking, it is possible to see the analogy
of knowledge elaboration between humankind's way and the artificial system's way. Digital data
are the "feelings" of an artificial system, and it needs to invent a method of extraction of knowledge
from the Universe of data. The cognitive computing paradigm implies that a system should be able
to extract the knowledge from raw data without any human-made algorithm. The first step of the paradigm
is analysis of raw data streams through the discovery of repeatable patterns of data. The knowledge
of relationships among the patterns provides a way to see the structures and to generalize the concepts
with the goal to synthesize new statements. The cognitive computing paradigm is capable of mimicking
the human's ability to generalize the notions. It is possible to say that the generalization step
provides the basis for discovering the abstract notions, revealing the abstract relations of patterns
and general rules of structure synthesis. If anyone continues the process of structure generalization,
then it is possible to build the multi-level hierarchy of abstract notions. Moreover, discovering
the generalized classes of notions is the first step towards a paradigm of artificial analytical
thinking. The most critical possible responsibility of cognitive computing could be the classification
of data and recognition of input data stream's states. The synthesis of new statements creates the
foundation for the foreseeing the possible data states and elaboration of knowledge about new data
classes by employing synthesis and checking the hypothesis.

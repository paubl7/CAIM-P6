In reductive proof search, proofs are naturally generalized by solutions, comprising all possibly
infinite structures generated by locally correct, bottom-up application of inference rules.
We propose an extension of the Curry-Howard paradigm of representation, from proofs to solutions:
to represent solutions by possibly infinite terms of a dedicated lambda-calculus. This new, comprehensive
approach to proof search is exemplified with the sequent calculus LJT for intuitionistic implication
logic. A finitary representation is proposed, comprising lambda-terms extended with a formal
greatest fixed point, and a type system that can be seen as a logic of coinductive proofs. In the finitary
system, fixed-point variables enjoy a relaxed form of binding that allows the detection of cycles
through the type system. Formal sums are used to express alternatives in the search process. Moreover,
formal sums are used in the coinductive syntax to define "decontraction" (contraction bottom-up)
- an operation whose theory we initiate in this paper. As a semantics, we assign a coinductive lambda-term
to each finitary term. The main result is the existence of an equivalent finitary representation
for any full solution space expressed coinductively. This result is the main ingredient in the proof
that our logic of coinductive proofs is sound and complete with respect to the coinductive semantics.
These results are the foundation for an original approach to proof search, where the search builds
the finitary representation of the full solution space, and the a posteriori analysis typically
consisting in applying a syntax-directed procedure or function. The paper illustrates this for
proof search and inhabitation problems in the simply-typed lambda-calculus, reviewing results
detailed elsewhere, and including new results that obtain extensive generalizations of the so-called
monatomic theorem.

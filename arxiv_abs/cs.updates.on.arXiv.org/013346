In this paper, a dense Internet of Things (IoT) monitoring system is studied in which a large number
of devices contend for transmitting timely status packets to their corresponding receivers over
wireless noisy channels, using a carrier sense multiple access (CSMA) scheme. When each device
completes one transmission, due to possible transmission failure, two cases with and without transmission
feedback to each device must be considered. Particularly, for the case with no feedback, the device
uses policy (I): It will go to an idle state and release the channel regardless of the outcome of the
transmission. For the case with perfect feedback, if the transmission succeeds, the device will
go to an idle state, otherwise, it uses either policy (W), i.e., it will go to a waiting state and re-contend
for channel access; or it uses policy (S), i.e., it will stay at a service state and occupy this channel
to attempt another transmission. For those three policies, the closed-form expressions of the
average age of information (AoI) of each device are characterized under schemes with and without
preemption in service. It is shown that, for each policy, the scheme with preemption in service always
achieves a smaller average AoI, compared with the scheme without preemption. Then, a mean-field
approximation approach with guaranteed accuracy is developed to analyze the asymptotic performance
for the considered system with an infinite number of devices and the effects of the system parameters
on the average AoI are characterized. Simulation results show that the proposed mean-field approximation
is accurate even for a small number of devices. The results also show that policy (S) achieves the
smallest average AoI compared with policies (I) and (W), and the average AoI does not always decrease
with the arrival rate for all three policies.

Population protocols model information spreading in networks where pairwise node exchanges are
determined by an external random scheduler. Most of the population protocols in the literature
assume that the participating $n$ nodes are honest. Such assumption may not be, however, accurate
for large-scale systems of small devices. Hence, in this work, we study a variant of population protocols,
where up to $f$ nodes can be Byzantine. We examine the majority (binary) consensus problem against
different levels of adversary strengths, ranging from the Full adversary that has complete knowledge
of all the node states to the Weak adversary that has only knowledge about which exchanges take place.
We also take into account Dynamic vs Static node corruption by the adversary. We give lower bounds
that require any algorithm solving the majority consensus to have initial difference $d = \Omega(f
+ 1)$ for the tally between the two proposed values, which holds for both the Full Static and Weak Dynamic
adversaries. We then present an algorithm that solves the majority consensus problem and tolerates
$f \leq n / c$ Byzantine nodes, for some constant $c>0$, with $d = \Omega(f + \sqrt{n \log n})$ and $O(\log^3
n)$ parallel time steps, using $O(\log n)$ states per node. We also give an alternative algorithm
with $d = \Omega(\min\{f \log^2 n + 1,n\})$. Moreover, we combine both algorithms into one using
random coins. The only other known previous work on Byzantine-resilient population protocols
tolerates up to $f = o(\sqrt n)$ faulty nodes and works against a static adversary; hence, our protocols
significantly improve the tolerance by an $\omega(\sqrt n)$ factor and all of them work correctly
against a stronger dynamic adversary.

Recent years have seen a proliferation of new digital products for the efficient management of indoor
spaces, with important applications like emergency management, virtual property showcasing
and interior design. These products rely on accurate 3D models of the environments considered,
including information on both architectural and non-permanent elements. These models must be
created from measured data such as RGB-D images or 3D point clouds, whose capture and consolidation
involves lengthy data workflows. This strongly limits the rate at which 3D models can be produced,
preventing the adoption of many digital services for indoor space management. We provide an alternative
to such data-intensive procedures by presenting Walk2Map, a data-driven approach to generate
floor plans only from trajectories of a person walking inside the rooms. Thanks to recent advances
in data-driven inertial odometry, such minimalistic input data can be acquired from the IMU readings
of consumer-level smartphones, which allows for an effortless and scalable mapping of real-world
indoor spaces. Our work is based on learning the latent relation between an indoor walk trajectory
and the information represented in a floor plan: interior space footprint, portals, and furniture.
We distinguish between recovering area-related (interior footprint, furniture) and wall-related
(doors) information and use two different neural architectures for the two tasks: an image-based
Encoder-Decoder and a Graph Convolutional Network, respectively. We train our networks using
scanned 3D indoor models and apply them in a cascaded fashion on an indoor walk trajectory at inference
time. We perform a qualitative and quantitative evaluation using both simulated and measured,
real-world trajectories, and compare against a baseline method for image-to-image translation.
The experiments confirm the feasibility of our approach.

Fast and reliable prediction of riverine flow velocities is important in many applications, including
flood risk management. The shallow water equations (SWEs) are commonly used for prediction of the
flow velocities. However, accurate and fast prediction with standard SWE solvers is challenging
in many cases. Traditional approaches are computationally expensive and require high-resolution
riverbed profile measurement ( bathymetry) for accurate predictions. As a result, they are a poor
fit in situations where they need to be evaluated repetitively due, for example, to varying boundary
condition (BC), or when the bathymetry is not known with certainty. In this work, we propose a two-stage
process that tackles these issues. First, using the principal component geostatistical approach
(PCGA) we estimate the probability density function of the bathymetry from flow velocity measurements,
and then we use multiple machine learning algorithms to obtain a fast solver of the SWEs, given augmented
realizations from the posterior bathymetry distribution and the prescribed range of BCs. The first
step allows us to predict flow velocities without direct measurement of the bathymetry. Furthermore,
the augmentation of the distribution in the second stage allows incorporation of the additional
bathymetry information into the flow velocity prediction for improved accuracy and generalization,
even if the bathymetry changes over time. Here, we use three solvers, referred to as PCA-DNN (principal
component analysis-deep neural network), SE (supervised encoder), and SVE (supervised variational
encoder), and validate them on a reach of the Savannah river near Augusta, GA. Our results show that
the fast solvers are capable of predicting flow velocities with good accuracy, at a computational
cost that is significantly lower than the cost of solving the full boundary value problem with traditional
methods.

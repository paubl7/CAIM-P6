In cryptocurrencies, the block reward is meant to serve as the incentive mechanism for miners to
commit resources to create blocks and in effect secure the system. Existing systems primarily divide
the reward in proportion to expended resources and follow one of two static models for total block
reward: (i) a fixed reward for each block (e.g., Ethereum), or (ii) one where the block reward halves
every set number of blocks (e.g., the Bitcoin model of halving roughly every 4 years) but otherwise
remains fixed between halvings. In recent work, a game-theoretic analysis of the static model under
asymmetric miner costs showed that an equilibrium always exists and is unique. Their analysis also
reveals how asymmetric costs can lead to large-scale centralization in blockchain mining, a phenomenon
that has been observed in Bitcoin and Ethereum and highlighted by other studies. In this work we introduce
a novel family of mining reward functions, HaPPY-Mine (HAsh-Pegged Proportional Yield), which
peg the value of the reward to the hashrate of the system, decreasing the reward as the hashrate increases.
HaPPY-Mine distributes rewards in proportion to expended hashrate and inherits the safety properties
of the generalized proportional reward function. We study HaPPY-Mine under a heterogeneous miner
cost model and show that an equilibrium always exists with a unique set of miner participants and
a unique total hashrate. Significantly, we prove that a HaPPY-Mine equilibrium is more decentralized
than the static model equilibrium under a set of metrics including number of mining participants
and hashrate distribution. Finally, we show that any HaPPY-Mine equilibrium is also safe against
collusion and sybil attacks, and explore how the market value of the currency affects the equilibrium.

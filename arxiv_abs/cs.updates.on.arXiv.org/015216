The fast-paced evolution of Android APIs has posed a challenging task for Android app developers.
To leverage Android's frequently released APIs, developers must often spend considerable effort
on API migrations. Prior research and Android official documentation typically provide enough
information to guide developers in identifying the API calls that must be migrated and the corresponding
API calls in an updated version of Android (what to migrate). However, API migration remains a challenging
task since developers lack the knowledge of how to migrate the API calls. There exist code examples,
such as Google Samples, that illustrate the usage of APIs. We posit that by analyzing the changes
of API usage in code examples, we can learn API migration patterns to assist developers with API Migrations.
In this paper, we propose an approach that learns API migration patterns from code examples, applies
these patterns to the source code of Android apps for API migration, and presents the results to users
as potential migration solutions. To evaluate our approach, we migrate API calls in open source
Android apps by learning API migration patterns from code examples. We find that our approach can
successfully learn API migration patterns and provide API migration assistance in 71 out of 80 cases.
Our approach can either migrate API calls with little to no extra modifications needed or provide
guidance to assist with the migrations. Through a user study, we find that adopting our approach
can reduce the time spent on migrating APIs, on average, by 29%. Moreover, our interviews with app
developers highlight the benefits of our approach when seeking API migrations. Our approach demonstrates
the value of leveraging the knowledge contained in software repositories to facilitate API migrations.

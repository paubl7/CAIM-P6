Propositional dynamic logic (PDL) is presented in Sch\"{u}tte-style mode as one-sided semiformal
tree-like sequent calculus Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$ with standard cut rule and the omega-rule
with principal formulas $\left[ P^{\ast }\right] \!A$. The omega-rule-free derivations in Seq$_{\omega
}^{\text{pdl}}$ are finite (trees) and sequents deducible by these finite derivations are valid
in PDL. Moreover the cut-elimination theorem for Seq$_{\omega}^{\text{pdl}}$ is provable in
Peano Arithmetic (PA)extended by transfinite induction up to Veblen's ordinal $\varphi_\omega\left(
0\right) $. Hence (by the cutfree subformula property) such predicative extension of PA proves
that any given $\left[ P^{\ast }\right] $-free sequent is valid in PDL iff it is deducible in Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$
by a finite cut- and omega-rule-free derivation, while PDL-validity of arbitrary star-free sequents
is decidable in polynomial space. The former also implies standard Herbrand-style conclusions,
which eventually leads to PSPACE-decidability of PDL-validity of $S$, provided that $P$ is atomic
and $A$ is in a suitable \emph{basic conjunctive normal form}. Furthermore we consider star-free
formulas $A$ in dual \emph{basic disjunctive normal form}, and corresponding expansions $S=\left\langle
P^{\ast }\right\rangle \!A\vee Z$ whose PDL-validity problem is known to be EXPTIME-complete.
We show that cutfree-derivability in Seq$_\omega^{\text{pdl}}$ (hence PDL-validity) of such
$S$\ is equivalent to plain validity of a suitable "transparent" quantified boolean formula $\widehat{S}$.
The whole proof can be formalized in PA extended by transfinite induction along $\varphi_\omega\left(
0\right)$ -- actually in the corresponding primitive recursive weakening, $\mathbf{PRA}_{\varphi_{\omega
}\left( 0\right)}$.

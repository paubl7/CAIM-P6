For a class $\mathcal{G}$ of graphs, the problem SUBGRAPH COMPLEMENT TO $\mathcal{G}$ asks whether
one can find a subset $S$ of vertices of the input graph $G$ such that complementing the subgraph induced
by $S$ in $G$ results in a graph in $\mathcal{G}$. We investigate the complexity of the problem when
$\mathcal{G}$ is $H$-free for $H$ being a complete graph, a star, a path, or a cycle. We obtain the
following results: - When $H$ is a $K_t$ (a complete graph on $t$ vertices) for any fixed $t\geq 1$,
the problem is solvable in polynomial-time. This applies even when $\mathcal{G}$ is a subclass
of $K_t$-free graphs recognizable in polynomial-time, for example, the class of $(t-2)$-degenerate
graphs. - When $H$ is a $K_{1,t}$ (a star graph on $t+1$ vertices), we obtain that the problem is NP-complete
for every $t\geq 5$. This, along with known results, leaves only two unresolved cases - $K_{1,3}$
and $K_{1,4}$. - When $H$ is a $P_t$ (a path on $t$ vertices), we obtain that the problem is NP-complete
for every $t\geq 7$, leaving behind only two unresolved cases - $P_5$ and $P_6$. - When $H$ is a $C_t$
(a cycle on $t$ vertices), we obtain that the problem is NP-complete for every $t\geq 8$, leaving
behind four unresolved cases - $C_4, C_5, C_6,$ and $C_7$. Further, we prove that these hard problems
do not admit subexponential-time algorithms (algorithms running in time $2^{o(|V(G)|)}$), assuming
the Exponential Time Hypothesis. A simple complementation argument implies that results for $\mathcal{G}$
are applicable for $\overline{\mathcal{G}}$, thereby obtaining similar results for $H$ being
the complement of a complete graph, a star, a path, or a cycle. Our results generalize two main results
and resolve one open question by Fomin et al. (Algorithmica, 2020).

We put forth new models for universal channel coding. Unlike standard codes which are designed for
a specific type of channel, our most general universal code makes communication resilient on every
channel, provided the noise level is below the tolerated bound, where the noise level t of a channel
is the logarithm of its ambiguity (the maximum number of strings that can be distorted into a given
one). The other more restricted universal codes still work for large classes of natural channels.
In a universal code, encoding is channel-independent, but the decoding function knows the type
of channel. We allow the encoding and the decoding functions to share randomness, which is unavailable
to the channel. There are two scenarios for the type of attack that a channel can perform. In the oblivious
scenario, codewords belong to an additive group and the channel distorts a codeword by adding a vector
from a fixed set. The selection is based on the message and the encoding function, but not on the codeword.
In the Hamming scenario, the channel knows the codeword and is fully adversarial. For a universal
code, there are two parameters of interest: the rate, which is the ratio between the message length
k and the codeword length n, and the number of shared random bits. We show the existence in both scenarios
of universal codes with rate 1-t/n - o(1), which is optimal modulo the o(1) term. The number of shared
random bits is O(log n) in the oblivious scenario, and O(n) in the Hamming scenario, which, for typical
values of the noise level, we show to be optimal, modulo the constant hidden in the O() notation. In
both scenarios, the universal encoding is done in time polynomial in n, but the channel-dependent
decoding procedures are in general not efficient. For some weaker classes of channels we construct
universal codes with polynomial-time encoding and decoding.

Phase retrieval (PR) is an important component in modern computational imaging systems. Many algorithms
have been developed over the past half century. Recent advances in deep learning have opened up a
new possibility for robust and fast PR. An emerging technique, called deep unfolding, provides
a systematic connection between conventional model-based iterative algorithms and modern data-based
deep learning. Unfolded algorithms, powered by data learning, have shown remarkable performance
and convergence speed improvement over the original algorithms. Despite their potential, most
existing unfolded algorithms are strictly confined to a fixed number of iterations when employing
layer-dependent parameters. In this study, we develop a novel framework for deep unfolding to overcome
the existing limitations. Even if our framework can be widely applied to general inverse problems,
we take PR as an example in the paper. Our development is based on an unfolded generalized expectation
consistent signal recovery (GEC-SR) algorithm, wherein damping factors are left for data-driven
learning. In particular, we introduce a hypernetwork to generate the damping factors for GEC-SR.
Instead of directly learning a set of optimal damping factors, the hypernetwork learns how to generate
the optimal damping factors according to the clinical settings, thus ensuring its adaptivity to
different scenarios. To make the hypernetwork work adapt to varying layer numbers, we use a recurrent
architecture to develop a dynamic hypernetwork, which generates a damping factor that can vary
online across layers. We also exploit a self-attention mechanism to enhance the robustness of the
hypernetwork. Extensive experiments show that the proposed algorithm outperforms existing ones
in convergence speed and accuracy, and still works well under very harsh settings, that many classical
PR algorithms unstable or even fail.

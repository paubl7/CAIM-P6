Online social networks have been one of the most effective platforms for marketing and advertising.
Through "word of mouth" effects, information or product adoption could spread from some influential
individuals to millions of users in social networks. Given a social network $G$ and a constant $k$,
the influence maximization problem seeks for $k$ nodes in $G$ that can influence the largest number
of nodes. This problem has found important applications, and a large amount of works have been devoted
to identifying the few most influential users. But most of existing works only focus on the diffusion
of a single idea or product in social networks. However, in reality, one company may produce multiple
kinds of products and one user may also have multiple adoptions. Given multiple kinds of different
products with different activation costs and profits, it is crucial for the company to distribute
the limited budget among multiple products in order to achieve profit maximization. Profit Maximization
with Multiple Adoptions (PM$^{2}$A) problem aims to seek for a seed set within the budget to maximize
the overall profit. In this paper, a Randomized Modified Greedy (RMG) algorithm based on the Reverse
Influence Sampling (RIS) technique is presented for the PM$^{2}$A problem, which could achieve
a $(1-1/e-\varepsilon)$-approximate solution with high probability. Compared with the algorithm
proposed in [16] that achieves a $\frac{1}{2}(1-1/e^{2})$-approximate solution, our algorithm
provides a better performance ratio which is also the best performance ratio of the PM$^{2}$A problem.
Comprehensive experiments on three real-world social networks are conducted, and the results
demonstrate that our RMG algorithm outperforms the algorithm proposed in [16] and other heuristics
in terms of profit maximization, and could better allocate the budget.

The priority model was introduced by Borodin, Rackoff, and Nielsen (2003) to capture greedy-like
algorithms. Motivated by the success of advice complexity in the area of online algorithms, Borodin
et al. (2020) extended the fixed priority model to include an advice tape oracle. They also developed
a reduction-based framework for proving lower bounds on the amount of advice required to achieve
certain approximation ratios in this rather powerful model. In order to capture most of the algorithms
that are considered greedy-like, the even stronger model of adaptive priority algorithms is needed.
We extend the adaptive priority model to include an advice tape oracle. We show how to modify the reduction-based
framework from the fixed priority case, making it applicable to the more powerful adaptive priority
algorithms. The framework provides a template, where one can obtain a lower bound relatively easily
by exhibiting "gadget patterns" fulfilling given criteria. In the process, we simplify the proof
that the framework works, and we strengthen all the earlier lower bounds by a factor two. As a motivating
example, we present a purely combinatorial adaptive priority algorithm with advice for Minimum
Vertex Cover on triangle-free graphs of maximum degree three. Our algorithm achieves optimality
and uses at most 7n/22 bits of advice. Known results imply that no adaptive priority algorithm without
advice can achieve optimality without advice, and we prove that 7n/22 is fewer bits than an online
algorithm with advice needs to reach optimality. Furthermore, we show connections between exact
algorithms and priority algorithms with advice. Priority algorithms with advice that achieve
optimality can be used to define corresponding exact algorithms, priority exact algorithms. The
lower bound templates for advice-based adaptive algorithms imply lower bounds on exact algorithms
designed in this way.

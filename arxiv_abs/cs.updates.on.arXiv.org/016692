Budget-management systems are one of the key components of modern auction markets. Internet advertising
platforms typically offer advertisers the possibility to pace the rate at which their budget is
depleted, through budget-pacing mechanisms. We focus on multiplicative pacing mechanisms in
an online setting in which a bidder is repeatedly confronted with a series of advertising opportunities.
After collecting bids, each item is then allocated through a single-item, second-price auction.
If there were no budgetary constraints, bidding truthfully would be an optimal choice for the advertiser.
However, since their budget is limited, the advertiser may want to shade their bid downwards in order
to preserve their budget for future opportunities, and to spread expenditures evenly over time.
The literature on online pacing problems mostly focuses on the setting in which the bidder optimizes
an additive separable objective, such as the total click-through rate or the revenue of the allocation.
In many settings, however, bidders may also care about other objectives which oftentimes are non-separable,
and therefore not amenable to traditional online learning techniques. Building on recent work,
we study the frequent case in which advertisers seek to reach a certain distribution of impressions
over a target population of users. We introduce a novel regularizer to achieve this desideratum,
and show how to integrate it into an online mirror descent scheme attaining the optimal order of sub-linear
regret compared to the optimal allocation in hindsight when inputs are drawn independently, from
an unknown distribution. Moreover, we show that our approach can easily be incorporated in standard
existing pacing systems that are not usually built for this objective. The effectiveness of our
algorithm in internet advertising applications is confirmed by numerical experiments on real-world
data.

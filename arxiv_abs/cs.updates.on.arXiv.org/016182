The field of dynamic graph algorithms aims at achieving a thorough understanding of real-world
networks whose topology evolves with time. Traditionally, the focus has been on the classic sequential,
centralized setting where the main quality measure of an algorithm is its update time, i.e. the time
needed to restore the solution after each update. While real-life networks are very often distributed
across multiple machines, the fundamental question of finding efficient dynamic, distributed
graph algorithms received little attention to date. The goal in this setting is to optimize both
the round and message complexities incurred per update step, ideally achieving a message complexity
that matches the centralized update time in $O(1)$ (perhaps amortized) rounds. Toward initiating
a systematic study of dynamic, distributed algorithms, we study some of the most central symmetry-breaking
problems: maximal independent set (MIS), maximal matching/(approx-) maximum cardinality matching
(MM/MCM), and $(\Delta + 1)$-vertex coloring. This paper focuses on dynamic, distributed algorithms
that are deterministic, and in particular -- robust against an adaptive adversary. Most of our focus
is on the MIS algorithm, which achieves $O\left(m^{2/3}\log^2 n\right)$ amortized messages in
$O\left(\log^2 n\right)$ amortized rounds in the Congest model. Notably, the amortized message
complexity of our algorithm matches the amortized update time of the best-known deterministic
centralized MIS algorithm by Gupta and Khan [SOSA'21] up to a polylog $n$ factor. The previous best
deterministic distributed MIS algorithm, by Assadi et al. [STOC'18], uses $O(m^{3/4})$ amortized
messages in $O(1)$ amortized rounds, i.e., we achieve a polynomial improvement in the message complexity
by a polylog $n$ increase to the round complexity; moreover, the algorithm of Assadi et al. makes
an implicit assumption that the [...]

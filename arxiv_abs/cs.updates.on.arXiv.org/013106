Misconduct accounts for the majority of retracted scientific publications and this database reveals
the disturbing trend in science~\citep{fang2012misconduct, brainard2018massive}. The objective
of the study is to find the association among the authors' collaboration, the number of retracted
papers, the number of retracted citations, journal impact factor, and research areas. We present
a detailed analysis of 12231 research papers indexed by Web of Science (WoS) as retracted publications
from 1981-2020. The study demonstrates the collaboration patterns of retracted publications
where 61.5% of authors have only one and 24.6% have two retracted papers; however, 2% of authors have
more than 10 retracted papers. To study the impact of citing retracted papers, we investigated the
retracted papers with citations. The study reveals that 55.2% of retracted papers have been cited
at least once, where 25.4% of papers are such papers where at least one citation turned out to be a retraction.
This shows the impact of scientific misconduct or fraud on new research. The number of retractions
is independent of the journal impact factor and as compared to high impact papers, low impact papers
are attracting more citations. We also investigate the citations received by retracted papers
published in higher as well as lower impact factor journals. 1/4th of the papers are retracted citations
that cited the retracted papers; however, there is no significant relationship exists between
the higher impact or lower impact journals with retractions or citations. Finally, how the average
team size and average retracted citations vary among different research areas are studied. The
study provides an insight that how a fraud leads to another fraud in the scientific world. Also, the
rising trend of citations of retracted papers is a serious concern.

Recently, artificial intelligence technologies and algorithms have become a major focus for advancements
in treatment planning for radiation therapy. As these are starting to become incorporated into
the clinical workflow, a major concern from clinicians is not whether the model is accurate, but
whether the model can express to a human operator when it does not know if its answer is correct. We
propose to use Monte Carlo dropout (MCDO) and the bootstrap aggregation (bagging) technique on
deep learning models to produce uncertainty estimations for radiation therapy dose prediction.
We show that both models are capable of generating a reasonable uncertainty map, and, with our proposed
scaling technique, creating interpretable uncertainties and bounds on the prediction and any
relevant metrics. Performance-wise, bagging provides statistically significant reduced loss
value and errors in most of the metrics investigated in this study. The addition of bagging was able
to further reduce errors by another 0.34% for Dmean and 0.19% for Dmax, on average, when compared
to the baseline framework. Overall, the bagging framework provided significantly lower MAE of
2.62, as opposed to the baseline framework's MAE of 2.87. The usefulness of bagging, from solely
a performance standpoint, does highly depend on the problem and the acceptable predictive error,
and its high upfront computational cost during training should be factored in to deciding whether
it is advantageous to use it. In terms of deployment with uncertainty estimations turned on, both
frameworks offer the same performance time of about 12 seconds. As an ensemble-based metaheuristic,
bagging can be used with existing machine learning architectures to improve stability and performance,
and MCDO can be applied to any deep learning models that have dropout as part of their architecture.

Goods can exhibit positive externalities impacting decisions of customers in socials networks.
Suppliers can integrate these externalities in their pricing strategies to increase their revenue.
Besides optimizing the prize, suppliers also have to consider their production and maintenance
costs. Predictive maintenance has the potential to reduce the maintenance costs and improve the
system availability. To address the joint optimization of pricing with network externalities
and predictive maintenance scheduling based on the condition of the system, we propose a bi-level
optimization solution based on game theory. In the first level, the manufacturing company decides
about the predictive maintenance scheduling of the units and the price of the goods. In the second
level, the customers decide about their consumption using an optimization approach in which the
objective function depends on their consumption, the consumption levels of other customers who
are connected through the graph, and the price of the network which is determined by the supplier.
To solve the problem, we propose the leader-multiple-followers game where the supplier as a leader
predicts the strategies of the followers. Then, customers as the followers obtain their strategies
based on the leader's and other followers' strategies. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
proposed method on a simulated case study. The results demonstrate that knowledge of the social
network graph results in an increased revenue compared to the case when the underlying social network
graph is not known. Moreover, the results demonstrate that obtaining the predictive maintenance
scheduling based on the proposed optimization approach leads to an increased profit compared to
the baseline decision-making (perform maintenance at the degradation limit).

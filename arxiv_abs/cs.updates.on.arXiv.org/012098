The outbreak of COVID-19 i.e. a variation of coronavirus, also known as novel corona virus causing
respiratory disease is a big concern worldwide since the end of December 2019. As of September 12,
2020, it has turned into an epidemic outbreak with more than 29 million confirmed cases and around
1 million reported deaths worldwide. It has created an urgent need to monitor and forecast COVID-19
spread behavior to better control this spread. Among all the popular models for COVID-19 forecasting,
statistical models are receiving much attention in media. However, statistical models are showing
less accuracy for long term forecasting, as there is high level of uncertainty and required data
is also not sufficiently available. In this paper, we propose a comparative analysis of deep learning
models to forecast the COVID-19 outbreak as an alternative to statistical models. We propose a new
Attention-based encoder-decoder model, named Attention-Long Short Term Memory (AttentionLSTM).
LSTM based neural network layer architecture incorporates the idea of fine-grained attention
mechanism i.e., attention on hidden state dimensions instead of hidden state vector itself, which
is capable of highlighting the importance and contribution of each hidden state dimension. It helps
in detection on crucial temporal information, resulting in a highly interpretable network. Additionally,
we implement a learnable vector embedding for time. As, time in a vector representation can be easily
added with many architectures. This vector representation is called Time2Vec. We have used COVID-19
data repository by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE) at Johns Hopkins University
to assess the proposed model's performance. The proposed model give superior forecasting accuracy
compared to other existing methods.

Speech synthesis, voice cloning, and voice conversion techniques present severe privacy and security
threats to users of voice user interfaces (VUIs). These techniques transform one or more elements
of a speech signal, e.g., identity and emotion, while preserving linguistic information. Adversaries
may use advanced transformation tools to trigger a spoofing attack using fraudulent biometrics
for a legitimate speaker. Conversely, such techniques have been used to generate privacy-transformed
speech by suppressing personally identifiable attributes in the voice signals, achieving anonymization.
Prior works have studied the security and privacy vectors in parallel, and thus it raises alarm that
if a benign user can achieve privacy by a transformation, it also means that a malicious user can break
security by bypassing the anti-spoofing mechanism. In this paper, we take a step towards balancing
two seemingly conflicting requirements: security and privacy. It remains unclear what the vulnerabilities
in one domain imply for the other, and what dynamic interactions exist between them. A better understanding
of these aspects is crucial for assessing and mitigating vulnerabilities inherent with VUIs and
building effective defenses. In this paper,(i) we investigate the applicability of the current
voice anonymization methods by deploying a tandem framework that jointly combines anti-spoofing
and authentication models, and evaluate the performance of these methods;(ii) examining analytical
and empirical evidence, we reveal a duality between the two mechanisms as they offer different ways
to achieve the same objective, and we show that leveraging one vector significantly amplifies the
effectiveness of the other;(iii) we demonstrate that to effectively defend from potential attacks
against VUIs, it is necessary to investigate the attacks from multiple complementary perspectives(security
and privacy).

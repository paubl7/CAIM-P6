Quantum machine learning (QML) has emerged as a promising field that leans on the developments in
quantum computing to explore large complex machine learning problems. Recently, some purely quantum
machine learning models were proposed such as the quantum convolutional neural networks (QCNN)
to perform classification on quantum data. However, all of the existing QML models rely on centralized
solutions that cannot scale well for large-scale and distributed quantum networks. Hence, it is
apropos to consider more practical quantum federated learning (QFL) solutions tailored towards
emerging quantum network architectures. Indeed, developing QFL frameworks for quantum networks
is critical given the fragile nature of computing qubits and the difficulty of transferring them.
On top of its practical momentousness, QFL allows for distributed quantum learning by leveraging
existing wireless communication infrastructure. This paper proposes the first fully quantum
federated learning framework that can operate over quantum data and, thus, share the learning of
quantum circuit parameters in a decentralized manner. First, given the lack of existing quantum
federated datasets in the literature, the proposed framework begins by generating the first quantum
federated dataset, with a hierarchical data format, for distributed quantum networks. Then, clients
sharing QCNN models are fed with the quantum data to perform a classification task. Subsequently,
the server aggregates the learnable quantum circuit parameters from clients and performs federated
averaging. Extensive experiments are conducted to evaluate and validate the effectiveness of
the proposed QFL solution. This work is the first to combine Google's TensorFlow Federated and TensorFlow
Quantum in a practical implementation.

The construction of three-dimensional multi-modal tissue maps provides an opportunity to spur
interdisciplinary innovations across temporal and spatial scales through information integration.
While the preponderance of effort is allocated to the cellular level and explore the changes in cell
interactions and organizations, contextualizing findings within organs and systems is essential
to visualize and interpret higher resolution linkage across scales. There is a substantial normal
variation of kidney morphometry and appearance across body size, sex, and imaging protocols in
abdominal computed tomography (CT). A volumetric atlas framework is needed to integrate and visualize
the variability across scales. However, there is no abdominal and retroperitoneal organs atlas
framework for multi-contrast CT. Hence, we proposed a high-resolution CT retroperitoneal atlas
specifically optimized for the kidney across non-contrast CT and early arterial, late arterial,
venous and delayed contrast enhanced CT. Briefly, we introduce a deep learning-based volume of
interest extraction method and an automated two-stage hierarchal registration pipeline to register
abdominal volumes to a high-resolution CT atlas template. To generate and evaluate the atlas, multi-contrast
modality CT scans of 500 subjects (without reported history of renal disease, age: 15-50 years,
250 males & 250 females) were processed. We demonstrate a stable generalizability of the atlas template
for integrating the normal kidney variation from small to large, across contrast modalities and
populations with great variability of demographics. The linkage of atlas and demographics provided
a better understanding of the variation of kidney anatomy across populations.

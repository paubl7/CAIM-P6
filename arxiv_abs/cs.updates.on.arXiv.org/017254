In the last years machine learning (ML) has moved from a academic endeavor to a pervasive technology
adopted in almost every aspect of computing. ML-powered products are now embedded in our digital
lives: from recommendations of what to watch, to divining our search intent, to powering virtual
assistants in consumer and enterprise settings. Recent successes in applying ML in natural sciences
revealed that ML can be used to tackle some of the hardest real-world problems humanity faces today.
For these reasons ML has become central in the strategy of tech companies and has gathered even more
attention from academia than ever before. Despite these successes, what we have witnessed so far
is just the beginning. Right now the people training and using ML models are expert developers working
within large organizations, but we believe the next wave of ML systems will allow a larger amount
of people, potentially without coding skills, to perform the same tasks. These new ML systems will
not require users to fully understand all the details of how models are trained and utilized for obtaining
predictions. Declarative interfaces are well suited for this goal, by hiding complexity and favouring
separation of interests, and can lead to increased productivity. We worked on such abstract interfaces
by developing two declarative ML systems, Overton and Ludwig, that require users to declare only
their data schema (names and types of inputs) and tasks rather then writing low level ML code. In this
article we will describe how ML systems are currently structured, highlight important factors
for their success and adoption, what are the issues current ML systems are facing and how the systems
we developed addressed them. Finally we will talk about learnings from the development of ML systems
throughout the years and how we believe the next generation of ML systems will look like.

Driven by the explosive growth of Internet of Things (IoT) devices with stringent requirements
on latency and reliability, ultra-reliability and low latency communication (uRLLC) has become
one of the three key communication scenarios for the fifth generation (5G) and beyond 5G communication
systems. In this paper, we focus on the beamforming design problem for the downlink multiuser uRLLC
systems. Since the strict demand on the reliability and latency, in general, short packet transmission
is a favorable form for uRLLC systems, which indicates the literature Shannon's capacity formula
is no longer applicable. With the finite blocklength transmission, the achievable delivery rate
is greatly influenced by the reliability and latency. Using the developed achievable delivery
rate formula for finite blocklength transmission, we respectively formulate the problems of interest
as the weighted sum rate maximization, energy efficiency maximization, and user fairness optimization
by considering the maximum allowable transmission power and minimum rate requirement. It's worthy
pointing out that this is the first work to design the beamforming vectors for the downlink multiuser
uRLLC systems. To address these non-convex problems, some important insights have been discovered
by analyzing the function of achievable delivery rate. For example, the minimum rate requirement
can be realized by low bounded the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio. Based on the discovered
results, we provide algorithms to optimize the beamforming vectors and power allocation, which
are guaranteed to converge to a local optimum solution of the formulated problems with low computational
complexity. Our simulation results reveal that our proposed beamforming algorithms outperform
the zero-forcing beamforming algorithm with equal power allocation widely used in the existing
literatures.

Active mobility offers an array of physical, emotional, and social wellbeing benefits. However,
with the proliferation of the sharing economy, new nonmotorized means of transport are entering
the fold, complementing some existing mobility options while competing with others. The purpose
of this research study is to investigate the adoption of three active travel modes; namely walking,
cycling and bikesharing, in a joint modeling framework. The analysis is based on an adaptation of
the stages of change framework, which originates from the health behavior sciences. Multivariate
ordered probit modeling drawing on U.S. survey data provides well-needed insights into individuals
preparedness to adopt multiple active modes as a function of personal, neighborhood and psychosocial
factors. The research suggests three important findings. 1) The joint model structure confirms
interdependence among different active mobility choices. The strongest complementarity is found
for walking and cycling adoption. 2) Each mode has a distinctive adoption path with either three
or four separate stages. We discuss the implications of derived stage-thresholds and plot adoption
contours for selected scenarios. 3) Psychological and neighborhood variables generate more coupling
among active modes than individual and household factors. Specifically, identifying strongly
with active mobility aspirations, experiences with multimodal travel, possessing better navigational
skills, along with supportive local community norms are the factors that appear to drive the joint
adoption decisions. This study contributes to the understanding of how decisions within the same
functional domain are related and help to design policies that promote active mobility by identifying
positive spillovers and joint determinants.

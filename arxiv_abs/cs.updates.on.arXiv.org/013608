Most correlation inequalities for high-dimensional functions in the literature, such as the Fortuin-Kasteleyn-Ginibre
(FKG) inequality and the celebrated Gaussian Correlation Inequality of Royen, are qualitative
statements which establish that any two functions of a certain type have non-negative correlation.
In this work we give a general approach that can be used to bootstrap many qualitative correlation
inequalities for functions over product spaces into quantitative statements. The approach combines
a new extremal result about power series, proved using complex analysis, with harmonic analysis
of functions over product spaces. We instantiate this general approach in several different concrete
settings to obtain a range of new and near-optimal quantitative correlation inequalities, including:
$\bullet$ A quantitative version of Royen's celebrated Gaussian Correlation Inequality. Royen
(2014) confirmed a conjecture, open for 40 years, stating that any two symmetric, convex sets must
be non-negatively correlated under any centered Gaussian distribution. We give a lower bound on
the correlation in terms of the vector of degree-2 Hermite coefficients of the two convex sets, analogous
to the correlation bound for monotone Boolean functions over $\{0,1\}^n$ obtained by Talagrand
(1996). $\bullet$ A quantitative version of the well-known FKG inequality for monotone functions
over any finite product probability space, generalizing the quantitative correlation bound for
monotone Boolean functions over $\{0,1\}^n$ obtained by Talagrand (1996). The only prior generalization
of which we are aware is due to Keller (2008, 2009, 2012), which extended Talagrand's result to product
distributions over $\{0,1\}^n$. We also give two different quantitative versions of the FKG inequality
for monotone functions over the continuous domain $[0,1]^n$, answering a question of Keller (2009).

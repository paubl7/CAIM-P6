Due to the nature of their pathways, NASA Terra and NASA Aqua satellites capture imagery containing
swath gaps, which are areas of no data. Swath gaps can overlap the region of interest (ROI) completely,
often rendering the entire imagery unusable by Machine Learning (ML) models. This problem is further
exacerbated when the ROI rarely occurs (e.g. a hurricane) and, on occurrence, is partially overlapped
with a swath gap. With annotated data as supervision, a model can learn to differentiate between
the area of focus and the swath gap. However, annotation is expensive and currently the vast majority
of existing data is unannotated. Hence, we propose an augmentation technique that considerably
removes the existence of swath gaps in order to allow CNNs to focus on the ROI, and thus successfully
use data with swath gaps for training. We experiment on the UC Merced Land Use Dataset, where we add
swath gaps through empty polygons (up to 20 percent areas) and then apply augmentation techniques
to fill the swath gaps. We compare the model trained with our augmentation techniques on the swath
gap-filled data with the model trained on the original swath gap-less data and note highly augmented
performance. Additionally, we perform a qualitative analysis using activation maps that visualizes
the effectiveness of our trained network in not paying attention to the swath gaps. We also evaluate
our results with a human baseline and show that, in certain cases, the filled swath gaps look so realistic
that even a human evaluator did not distinguish between original satellite images and swath gap-filled
images. Since this method is aimed at unlabeled data, it is widely generalizable and impactful for
large scale unannotated datasets from various space data domains.

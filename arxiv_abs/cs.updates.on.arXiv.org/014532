Let $G$ be a graph on $n$ nodes. In the stochastic population protocol model, a collection of $n$ indistinguishable,
resource-limited nodes collectively solve tasks via pairwise interactions. In each interaction,
two randomly chosen neighbors first read each other's states, and then update their local states.
A rich line of research has established tight upper and lower bounds on the complexity of fundamental
tasks, such as majority and leader election, in this model, when $G$ is a clique. Specifically, in
the clique, these tasks can be solved fast, i.e., in $n \operatorname{polylog} n$ pairwise interactions,
with high probability, using at most $\operatorname{polylog} n$ states per node. In this work,
we consider the more general setting where $G$ is an arbitrary graph, and present a technique for
simulating protocols designed for fully-connected networks in any connected regular graph. Our
main result is a simulation that is efficient on many interesting graph families: roughly, the simulation
overhead is polylogarithmic in the number of nodes, and quadratic in the conductance of the graph.
As a sample application, we show that, in any regular graph with conductance $\phi$, both leader
election and exact majority can be solved in $\phi^{-2} \cdot n \operatorname{polylog} n$ pairwise
interactions, with high probability, using at most $\phi^{-2} \cdot \operatorname{polylog}
n$ states per node. This shows that there are fast and space-efficient population protocols for
leader election and exact majority on graphs with good expansion properties. We believe our results
will prove generally useful, as they allow efficient technology transfer between the well-mixed
(clique) case, and the under-explored spatial setting.

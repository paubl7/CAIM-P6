The computational underpinnings of positive psychotic symptoms have recently received significant
attention. Candidate mechanisms include some combination of maladaptive priors and reduced updating
of these priors during perception. A potential benefit of models with such mechanisms is their ability
to link multiple levels of explanation. This is key to improving how we understand the experience
of psychosis. Moreover, it points us towards more comprehensive avenues for therapeutic research
by providing a putative mechanism that could allow for the generation of new treatments from first
principles. In order to demonstrate this, our conceptual paper will discuss the application of
the insights from previous computational models to an important and complex set of evidence-based
clinical interventions with strong social elements, such as coordinated specialty care clinics
in early psychosis and assertive community treatment. These interventions may include but also
go beyond psychopharmacology, providing, we argue, structure and predictability for patients
experiencing psychosis. We develop the argument that this structure and predictability directly
counteract the relatively low precision afforded to sensory information in psychosis, while also
providing the patient more access to external cognitive resources in the form of providers and the
structure of the programs themselves. We discuss how computational models explain the resulting
reduction in symptoms, as well as the predictions these models make about potential responses of
patients to modifications or to different variations of these interventions. We also link, via
the framework of computational models, the experiences of patients and response to interventions
to putative neurobiology.

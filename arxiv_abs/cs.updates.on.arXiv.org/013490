Permissioned ledger technologies have gained significant traction over the last few years. For
practical reasons, their applications have focused on transforming narrowly scoped use-cases
in isolation. This has led to a proliferation of niche, isolated networks that are quickly becoming
data and value silos. To increase value across the broader ecosystem, these networks must seamlessly
integrate with existing systems and interoperate with one another. A fundamental requirement
for enabling crosschain communication is the ability to prove the validity of the internal state
of a ledger to an external party. However, due to the closed nature of permissioned ledgers, their
internal state is opaque to an external observer. This makes consuming and verifying states from
these networks a non-trivial problem. This paper addresses this fundamental requirement for state
sharing across permissioned ledgers. In particular, we address two key problems for external clients:
(i) assurances on the validity of state in a permissioned ledger and (ii) the ability to reason about
the currency of state. We assume an adversarial model where the members of the committee managing
the permissioned ledger can be malicious in the absence of detectability and accountability. We
present a formalization of the problem for state sharing and examine its security properties under
different adversarial conditions. We propose the design of a protocol that uses a secure public
ledger for providing guarantees on safety and the ability to reason about time, with at least one
honest member in the committee. We then provide a formal security analysis of our design and a proof
of concept implementation based on Hyperledger Fabric demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed protocol.

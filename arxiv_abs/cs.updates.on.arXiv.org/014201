Complex networks are pervasive in the real world, capturing dyadic interactions between pairs
of vertices, and a large corpus has emerged on their mining and modeling. However, many phenomena
are comprised of polyadic interactions between more than two vertices. Such complex hypergraphs
range from emails among groups of individuals, scholarly collaboration, or joint interactions
of proteins in living cells. A key generative principle within social and other complex networks
is transitivity, where friends of friends are more likely friends. The previously proposed Iterated
Local Transitivity (ILT) model incorporated transitivity as an evolutionary mechanism. The ILT
model provably satisfies many observed properties of social networks, such as densification,
low average distances, and high clustering coefficients. We propose a new, generative model for
complex hypergraphs based on transitivity, called the Iterated Local Transitivity Hypergraph
(or ILTH) model. In ILTH, we iteratively apply the principle of transitivity to form new hypergraphs.
The resulting model generates hypergraphs simulating properties observed in real-world complex
hypergraphs, such as densification and low average distances. We consider properties unique to
hypergraphs not captured by their 2-section. We show that certain motifs, which are specified subhypergraphs
of small order, have faster growth rates in ILTH hypergraphs than in random hypergraphs with the
same order and expected average degree. We show that the graphs admitting a homomorphism into the
2-section of the initial hypergraph appear as induced subgraphs in the 2-section of ILTH hypergraphs.
We consider new and existing hypergraph clustering coefficients, and show that these coefficients
have larger values in ILTH hypergraphs than in comparable random hypergraphs.

The computational analysis of Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) data aims at the identification
of interesting mass co-localizations and the visualization of their lateral distribution in the
sample, usually a tissue cross section. But as the morphological structure of tissues and the different
kinds of mass co-localization naturally show a huge diversity, the selection and tuning of the computational
method is a time-consuming effort. In this work we address the special problem of computationally
grouping mass channel images according to their similarities in their lateral distribution patterns.
Such an analysis is driven by the idea, that groups of molecules that feature a similar distribution
pattern may have a functional relation. But the selection of the similarity function and other parameters
is often done by a time-consuming and unsatsifactory trial and error. We propose a new flexible workflow
scheme called SoRC (sum of ranked cluster indices) for automating this tuning step and making it
much more efficient. We test SoRC using three different data sets acquired from the lab for three
different kinds of samples (barley seed, mouse bladder tissue, human PXE skin). We show, that SORC
can be applied to score and visualize the results obtained with the applied methods in short time
without too much effort. In our application example, the SoRC results for the three data sets reveal
that a) some well-known similarity functions are suited to achieve good results for all three data
sets and b) for the MSI data featuring a higher degree of irregularity improved results can be achieved
by applying non-standard similarity functions. The SoRC scores computed with our approach indicate
that an automated testing and scoring of different methods for mass channel image grouping can improve
the final outcome of a study by finally selecting the methods of the highest scores.

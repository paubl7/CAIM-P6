In recent years, with the advancements in information and communication technology, different
emerging on-demand shared mobility services have been introduced as innovative solutions in the
low-density areas, including on-demand transit (ODT), mobility-on-demand (MOD) transit, and
crowdsourced mobility services. However, due to their infancy, there is a strong need to understand
and model the demand for these services. In this study, we developed trip production and distribution
models for ODT services at Dissemination Areas (DA) level using four machine learning algorithms:
Random Forest (RF), Bagging, Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN). The
data used in the modelling process were acquired from Belleville's ODT operational data and 2016
census data. Bayesian optimalization approach was used to find the optimal architecture of the
adopted algorithms. Moreover, post-hoc model analysis was employed to interpret the predictions
and examine the importance of the explanatory variables. The results showed that the land-use type
was the most important variable in the trip production model. On the other hand, the demographic
characteristics of the trip destination were the most important variables in the trip distribution
model. Moreover, the results revealed that higher trip distribution levels are expected between
dissemination areas with commercial/industrial land-use type and dissemination areas with high-density
residential land-use. Our findings suggest that the performance of ODT services can be further
enhanced by (a) locating idle vehicles in the neighbourhoods with commercial/industrial land-use
and (b) using the spatio-temporal demand models obtained in this work to continuously update the
operating fleet size.

Depth cameras are emerging as a cornerstone modality with diverse applications that directly or
indirectly rely on measured depth, including personal devices, robotics, and self-driving vehicles.
Although time-of-flight (ToF) methods have fueled these applications, the precision and robustness
of ToF methods is limited by relying on photon time-tagging or modulation after photo-conversion.
Successful optical modulation approaches have been restricted fiber-coupled modulation with
large coupling losses or interferometric modulation with sub-cm range, and the precision gap between
interferometric methods and ToF methods is more than three orders of magnitudes. In this work, we
close this gap and propose a computational imaging method for all-optical free-space correlation
before photo-conversion that achieves micron-scale depth resolution with robustness to surface
reflectance and ambient light with conventional silicon intensity sensors. To this end, we solve
two technical challenges: modulating at GHz rates and computational phase unwrapping. We propose
an imaging approach with resonant polarization modulators and devise a novel optical dual-pass
frequency-doubling which achieves high modulation contrast at more than 10GHz. At the same time,
centimeter-wave modulation together with a small modulation bandwidth render existing phase
unwrapping methods ineffective. We tackle this problem with a neural phase unwrapping method that
exploits that adjacent wraps are often highly correlated. We validate the proposed method in simulation
and experimentally, where it achieves micron-scale depth precision. We demonstrate precise depth
sensing independently of surface texture and ambient light and compare against existing analog
demodulation methods, which we outperform across all tested scenarios.

Optimally mapping a parallel application to compute and communication resources is increasingly
important as both system size and heterogeneity increase. A similar mapping problem exists in gate-based
quantum computing where the objective is to map tasks to gates in a topology-aware fashion. This
is an NP-complete graph isomorphism problem, and existing task assignment approaches are either
heuristic or based on physical optimization algorithms, providing different speed and solution
quality trade-offs. Ising machines such as quantum and digital annealers have recently become
available and offer an alternative hardware solution to solve this type of optimization problems.
In this paper, we propose an algorithm that allows solving the topology-aware assignment problem
using Ising machines. We demonstrate the algorithm on two use cases, i.e. classical task scheduling
and quantum circuit gate scheduling. TIGER---topology-aware task/gate assignment mapper tool---implements
our proposed algorithms and automatically integrates them into the quantum software environment.
To address the limitations of physical solver, we propose and implement a domain-specific partition
strategy that allows solving larger-scale problems and a weight optimization algorithm that allows
tuning Ising model parameters to achieve better restuls. We use D-Wave's quantum annealer to demonstrate
our algorithm and evaluate the proposed tool flow in terms of performance, partition efficiency,
and solution quality. Results show significant speed-up compared to classical solutions, better
scalability, and higher solution quality when using TIGER together with the proposed partition
method. It reduces the data movement cost by 68\% in average for quantum circuit assignment compared
to the IBM QX optimizer.

Researchers have suggested that "the Manosphere," a conglomerate of men-centered online communities,
may serve as a gateway to far right movements. In that context, this paper quantitatively studies
the migratory patterns between a variety of groups within the Manosphere and the Alt-right, a loosely
connected far right movement that has been particularly active in mainstream social networks.
Our analysis leverages over 300 million comments spread through Reddit (in 115 subreddits) and
YouTube (in 526 channels) to investigate whether the audiences of channels and subreddits associated
with these communities have converged between 2006 and 2018. In addition to subreddits related
to the communities of interest, we also collect data on counterparts: other groups of users which
we use for comparison (e.g., for YouTube we use a set of media channels). Besides measuring the similarity
in the commenting user bases of these communities, we perform a migration study, calculating to
which extent users in the Manosphere gradually engage with Alt-right content. Our results suggest
that there is a large overlap between the user bases of the Alt-right and of the Manosphere and that
members of the Manosphere have a bigger chance to engage with far right content than carefully chosen
counterparts. However, our analysis also shows that migration and user base overlap varies substantially
across different platforms and within the Manosphere. Members of some communities (e.g., Men's
Rights Activists) gradually engage with the Alt-right significantly more than counterparts on
both Reddit and YouTube, whereas for other communities, this engagement happens mostly on Reddit
(e.g., Pick Up Artists). Overall, our work paints a nuanced picture of the pipeline between the Manosphere
and the Alt-right, which may inform platforms' policies and moderation decisions regarding these
communities.

Deep graph embedding is an important approach for community discovery. Deep graph neural network
with self-supervised mechanism can obtain the low-dimensional embedding vectors of nodes from
unlabeled and unstructured graph data. The high-order information of graph can provide more abundant
structure information for the representation learning of nodes. However, most self-supervised
graph neural networks only use adjacency matrix as the input topology information of graph and cannot
obtain too high-order information since the number of layers of graph neural network is fairly limited.
If there are too many layers, the phenomenon of over smoothing will appear. Therefore how to obtain
and fuse high-order information of graph by a shallow graph neural network is an important problem.
In this paper, a deep graph embedding algorithm with self-supervised mechanism for community discovery
is proposed. The proposed algorithm uses self-supervised mechanism and different high-order
information of graph to train multiple deep graph convolution neural networks. The outputs of multiple
graph convolution neural networks are fused to extract the representations of nodes which include
the attribute and structure information of a graph. In addition, data augmentation and negative
sampling are introduced into the training process to facilitate the improvement of embedding result.
The proposed algorithm and the comparison algorithms are conducted on the five experimental data
sets. The experimental results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms the comparison algorithms
on the most experimental data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm
is an effective algorithm for community discovery.

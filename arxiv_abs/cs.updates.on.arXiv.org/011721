What is Virtual Reality? A professional tool, made to facilitate our everyday tasks? A conceptual
mistake, accompanied by cybersickness and unsolved locomotion issues since the very beginning?
Or just another source of entertainment that helps us escape from our deteriorating world? The public
and scientific opinions in this respect are diverse. Furthermore, as researchers, we sometimes
ask ourselves whether our work in this area is really "worth it", given the ambiguous prognosis regarding
the future of VR. To tackle this question, we explore three different areas of VR research in this
dissertation, namely locomotion, interaction, and perception. We begin our journey by structuring
VR locomotion and by introducing a novel locomotion concept for large distance traveling via virtual
body resizing. In the second part, we focus on our interaction possibilities in VR. We learn how to
represent virtual objects via self-transforming controllers and how to store our items in VR inventories.
We design comprehensive 3D gestures for the audience and provide an I/O abstraction layer to facilitate
the realization and usage of such diverse interaction modalities. The third part is dedicated to
the exploration of perceptual phenomena in VR. In contrast to locomotion and interaction, our contributions
in the field of perception emphasize the strong points of immersive setups. We utilize VR to transfer
the illusion of virtual body ownership to nonhumanoid avatars and exploit this phenomenon for novel
gaming experiences with animals in the leading role. As one of our contributions, we demonstrate
how to repurpose the dichoptic presentation capability of immersive setups for preattentive zero-overhead
highlighting in visualizations. We round off the dissertation by coming back to VR research in general,
providing a critical assessment of our contributions and sharing our lessons learned along the
way.

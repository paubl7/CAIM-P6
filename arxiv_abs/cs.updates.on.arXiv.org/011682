Each memoryless binary-input channel (BIC) can be uniquely described by its Blackwell measure,
which is a probability distribution on the unit interval $[0,1]$ with mean $1/2$. Conversely, any
such probability distribution defines a BIC. The evolution of the Blackwell measure under Arikan's
polar transform is derived for general BICs, and is analogous to density evolution as cited in the
literature. The present analysis emphasizes functional equations. Consequently, the evolution
of a variety of channel functionals is characterized, including the symmetric capacity, Bhattacharyya
parameter, moments of information density, Hellinger affinity, Gallager's reliability function,
the Hirschfeld-Gebelein-Renyi maximal correlation, and the Bayesian information gain. The evolution
of measure is specialized for symmetric BICs according to their decomposition into binary symmetric
(sub)-channels (BSCs), which simplifies iterative computations and the construction of polar
codes. It is verified that, as a consequence of the Blackwell--Sherman--Stein theorem, all channel
functionals $\mathrm{I}_f$ that can be expressed as an expectation of a convex function $f$ with
respect to the Blackwell measure of a channel polarize in each iteration due to the polar transformation
on the class of symmetric BICs. Moreover, for $f$ either convex or non-convex, a necessary and sufficient
condition is established to determine whether the random process associated with each $\mathrm{I}_f$
is a martingale, submartingale, or supermartingale. Represented via functional inequalities
in terms of $f$, this condition is numerically verifiable for all $\mathrm{I}_f$, and can generate
analytical proofs. To exhibit one such proof, it is shown that the random process associated with
the squared maximal correlation parameter is a supermartingale, and converges almost surely on
the unit interval $[0,1]$.

This paper aims to develop new mathematical and computational tools for modeling the distribution
of portfolio returns across portfolios. We establish relevant mathematical formulas and propose
efficient algorithms, drawing upon powerful techniques in computational geometry and the literature
on splines, to compute the probability density function, the cumulative distribution function,
and the k-th moment of the probability function. Our algorithmic tools and implementations efficiently
handle portfolios with 10000 assets, and compute moments of order k up to 40 in a few seconds, thus
handling real-life scenarios. We focus on the long-only strategy which is the most common type of
investment, i.e. on portfolios whose weights are non-negative and sum up to 1; our approach is readily
generalizable. Thus, we leverage a geometric representation of the stock market, where the investment
set defines a simplex polytope. The cumulative distribution function corresponds to a portfolio
score capturing the percentage of portfolios yielding a return not exceeding a given value. We introduce
closed-form analytic formulas for the first 4 moments of the cross-sectional returns distribution,
as well as a novel algorithm to compute all higher moments. We show that the first 4 moments are a direct
mapping of the asset returns' moments. All of our algorithms and solutions are fully general and
include the special case of equal asset returns, which was sometimes excluded in previous works.
Finally, we apply our portfolio score in the design of new performance measures and asset management.
We found our score-based optimal portfolios less concentrated than the mean-variance portfolio
and much less risky in terms of ranking.

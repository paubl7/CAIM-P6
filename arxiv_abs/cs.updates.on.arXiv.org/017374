Phase Change Memory (PCM) is an attractive candidate for main memory as it offers non-volatility
and zero leakage power, while providing higher cell densities, longer data retention time, and
higher capacity scaling compared to DRAM. In PCM, data is stored in the crystalline or amorphous
state of the phase change material. The typical electrically-controlled PCM (EPCM), however,
suffers from longer write latency and higher write energy compared to DRAM and limited multi-level
cell (MLC) capacities. These challenges limit the performance of data-intensive applications
running on computing systems with EPCMs. Recently, researchers demonstrated optically-controlled
PCM (OPCM) cells, with support for 5 bits/cell in contrast to 2 bits/cell in EPCM. These OPCM cells
can be accessed directly with optical signals that are multiplexed in high-bandwidth-density
silicon-photonic links. The higher MLC capacity in OPCM and the direct cell access using optical
signals enable an increased read/write throughput and lower energy per access than EPCM. However,
due to the direct cell access using optical signals, OPCM systems cannot be designed using conventional
memory architecture. We need a complete redesign of the memory architecture that is tailored to
the properties of OPCM technology. This paper presents the design of a unified network and main memory
system called COSMOS that combines OPCM and silicon-photonic links to achieve high memory throughput.
COSMOS is composed of a hierarchical multi-banked OPCM array with novel read and write access protocols,
and uses an Electrical-Optical-Electrical (E-O-E) control unit to interface with the processor.
Our evaluation of a 2.5D-integrated system containing a processor and COSMOS demonstrates 2.14x
average speedup compared to an EPCM system. COSMOS consumes 3.8x lower read energy-per-bit and
5.97x lower write energy-per-bit compared to EPCM.

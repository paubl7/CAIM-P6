The combination of the infrastructure provided by the Internet of Things (IoT) with numerous processing
nodes present at the Edge Computing (EC) ecosystem opens up new pathways to support intelligent
applications. Such applications can be provided upon humongous volumes of data collected by IoT
devices being transferred to the edge nodes through the network. Various processing activities
can be performed on the discussed data and multiple collaborative opportunities between EC nodes
can facilitate the execution of the desired tasks. In order to support an effective interaction
between edge nodes, the knowledge about the geographically distributed data should be shared.
Obviously, the migration of large amounts of data will harm the stability of the network stability
and its performance. In this paper, we recommend the exchange of data synopses than real data between
EC nodes to provide them with the necessary knowledge about peer nodes owning similar data. This
knowledge can be valuable when considering decisions such as data/service migration and tasks
offloading. We describe an continuous reasoning model that builds a temporal similarity map of
the available datasets to get nodes understanding the evolution of data in their peers. We support
the proposed decision making mechanism through an intelligent similarity extraction scheme based
on an unsupervised machine learning model, and, at the same time, combine it with a statistical measure
that represents the trend of the so-called discrepancy quantum. Our model can reveal the differences
in the exchanged synopses and provide a datasets similarity map which becomes the appropriate knowledge
base to support the desired processing activities. We present the problem under consideration
and suggest a solution for that, while, at the same time, we reveal its advantages and disadvantages
through a large number of experiments.

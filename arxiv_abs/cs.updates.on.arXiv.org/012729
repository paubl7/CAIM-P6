\emph{Focused sequent calculi} are a refinement of sequent calculi, where additional side-conditions
on the applicability of inference rules force the implementation of a proof search strategy. Focused
cut-free proofs exhibit a special normal form that is used for defining identity of sequent calculi
proofs. We introduce a novel focused display calculus fD.LG and a fully polarized algebraic semantics
FP.LG for Lambek-Grishin logic by generalizing the theory of \emph{multi-type calculi} and their
algebraic semantics with \emph{heterogenous consequence relations}. The calculus fD.LG has
\emph{strong focalization} and it is \emph{sound and complete} w.r.t. FP.LG. This completeness
result is in a sense stronger than completeness with respect to standard polarized algebraic semantics
(see e.g. the phase semantics of Bastenhof for Lambek-Grishin logic or Hamano and Takemura for linear
logic), insofar we do not need to quotient over proofs with consecutive applications of shifts over
the same formula. We plan to investigate the connections, if any, between this completeness result
and the notion of \emph{full completeness} introduced by Abramsky et al. We also show a number of
additional results. fD.LG is sound and complete w.r.t. LG-algebras: this amounts to a semantic
proof of the so-called \emph{completeness of focusing}, given that the standard (display) sequent
calculus for Lambek-Grishin logic is complete w.r.t. LG-algebras. fD.LG and the focused calculus
f.LG of Moortgat and Moot are equivalent with respect to proofs, indeed there is an effective translation
from f.LG-derivations to fD.LG-derivations and vice versa: this provides the link with operational
semantics, given that every f.LG-derivation is in a Curry-Howard correspondence with a directional
$\overline\lambda\mu\widetilde{\mu}$-term.

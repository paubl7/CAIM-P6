Nonprofit crowdsourcing platforms such as food recovery organizations rely on volunteers to perform
time-sensitive tasks. To encourage volunteers to complete a task, platforms use nudging mechanisms
to notify a subset of volunteers with the hope that at least one of them responds positively. However,
since excessive notifications may reduce volunteer engagement, the platform faces a trade-off
between notifying more volunteers for the current task and saving them for future ones. Motivated
by these applications, we introduce the online volunteer notification problem, a generalization
of online stochastic bipartite matching where tasks arrive following a known time-varying distribution
over task types. Upon arrival of a task, the platform notifies a subset of volunteers with the objective
of minimizing the number of missed tasks. To capture each volunteer's adverse reaction to excessive
notifications, we assume that a notification triggers a random period of inactivity, during which
she will ignore all notifications. However, if a volunteer is active and notified, she will perform
the task with a given pair-specific match probability that captures her preference for the task.
We develop an online randomized policy that achieves a constant-factor guarantee close to the upper
bound we establish for the performance of any online policy. Our policy as well as hardness results
are parameterized by the minimum discrete hazard rate of the inter-activity time distribution.
The design of our policy relies on sparsifying an ex-ante feasible solution by solving a sequence
of dynamic programs. Further, in collaboration with Food Rescue U.S., a volunteer-based food recovery
platform, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our policy by testing them on the platform's data
from various locations across the U.S.

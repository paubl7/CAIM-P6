Respiratory diseases, including asthma, bronchitis, pneumonia, and upper respiratory tract
infection (RTI), are among the most common diseases in clinics. The similarities among the symptoms
of these diseases precludes prompt diagnosis upon the patients' arrival. In pediatrics, the patients'
limited ability in expressing their situation makes precise diagnosis even harder. This becomes
worse in primary hospitals, where the lack of medical imaging devices and the doctors' limited experience
further increase the difficulty of distinguishing among similar diseases. In this paper, a pediatric
fine-grained diagnosis-assistant system is proposed to provide prompt and precise diagnosis
using solely clinical notes upon admission, which would assist clinicians without changing the
diagnostic process. The proposed system consists of two stages: a test result structuralization
stage and a disease identification stage. The first stage structuralizes test results by extracting
relevant numerical values from clinical notes, and the disease identification stage provides
a diagnosis based on text-form clinical notes and the structured data obtained from the first stage.
A novel deep learning algorithm was developed for the disease identification stage, where techniques
including adaptive feature infusion and multi-modal attentive fusion were introduced to fuse
structured and text data together. Clinical notes from over 12000 patients with respiratory diseases
were used to train a deep learning model, and clinical notes from a non-overlapping set of about 1800
patients were used to evaluate the performance of the trained model. The average precisions (AP)
for pneumonia, RTI, bronchitis and asthma are 0.878, 0.857, 0.714, and 0.825, respectively, achieving
a mean AP (mAP) of 0.819.

Mechanism design for one-sided markets has been investigated for several decades in economics
and in computer science. More recently, there has been an increased attention on mechanisms for
two-sided markets, in which buyers and sellers act strategically. For two-sided markets, an impossibility
result of Myerson and Satterthwaite states that no mechanism can simultaneously satisfy individual
rationality (IR), incentive compatibility (IC), strong budget-balance (SBB), and be efficient.
On the other hand, important applications to web advertisement, stock exchange, and frequency
spectrum allocation, require us to consider two-sided combinatorial auctions in which buyers
have preferences on subsets of items, and sellers may offer multiple heterogeneous items. No efficient
mechanism was known so far for such two-sided combinatorial markets. This work provides the first
IR, IC and SBB mechanisms that provides an O(1)-approximation to the optimal social welfare for
two-sided markets. An initial construction yields such a mechanism, but exposes a conceptual problem
in the traditional SBB notion. This leads us to define the stronger notion of direct trade strong
budget balance (DSBB). We then proceed to design mechanisms that are IR, IC, DSBB, and again provide
an O(1)-approximation to the optimal social welfare. Our mechanisms work for any number of buyers
with XOS valuations - a class in between submodular and subadditive functions - and any number of
sellers. We provide a mechanism that is dominant strategy incentive compatible (DSIC) if the sellers
each have one item for sale, and one that is bayesian incentive compatible (BIC) if sellers hold multiple
items and have additive valuations over them. Finally, we present a DSIC mechanism for the case that
the valuation functions of all buyers and sellers are additive.

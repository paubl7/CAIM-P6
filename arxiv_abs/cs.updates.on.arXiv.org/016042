Water Distribution Systems(WDS) are critical infrastructures that deliver potable water to residential
areas. Incidents to pipelines cause water loss and contamination in pipelines. Hence, water quality
monitoring is one of the requirements for utility managers to ensure the health of water. However,
it is challenging to access all parts of the WDS since they are long and comprise pipes with different
configurations and sizes. In this paper, we propose a size-adaptable and modular in-pipe robot
so-called SmartCrawler that works based on wheel wall press mechanism. We develop a two-phase motion
control algorithm that enables reliable motion in straight and non-straight configurations of
in-service pipelines. The controller in phase 1 stabilizes the robot in the straight paths and tracks
the desired velocity with high-level linear quadratic regulator (LQR) and low-level proportional-integral-derivative
(PID) based controllers. The controller in phase 2 with a designed error-check submodule and velocity
controller, enables the robot to steer to the desired directions at non-straight configurations.
The performance of the two-phase controller is evaluated with experimental and simulation results.
Wireless underground communication is a challenging task for underground applications. We propose
a bi-directional wireless sensor module based on active radio frequency identification (RFID)
that works in 434MHz carrier frequency and evaluate its performance with experimental results.
At the end of this work, we design the printed circuit board (PCB) for the SmartCrawler that embeds
the electronic components in a confined and sealed environment. The simulation and the experimental
results prove the proposed robotic system can be used for in pipe missions where wireless communication
is needed to communicate with the robot during operation.

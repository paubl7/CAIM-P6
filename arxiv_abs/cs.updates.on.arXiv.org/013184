In the semialgebraic range searching problem, we are to preprocess $n$ points in $\mathbb{R}^d$
s.t. for any query range from a family of constant complexity semialgebraic sets, all the points
intersecting the range can be reported or counted efficiently. When the ranges are composed of simplices,
the problem can be solved using $S(n)$ space and with $Q(n)$ query time with $S(n)Q^d(n) = \tilde{O}(n^d)$
and this trade-off is almost tight. Consequently, there exists low space structures that use $\tilde{O}(n)$
space with $O(n^{1-1/d})$ query time and fast query structures that use $O(n^d)$ space with $O(\log^{d}
n)$ query time. However, for the general semialgebraic ranges, only low space solutions are known,
but the best solutions match the same trade-off curve as the simplex queries. It has been conjectured
that the same could be done for the fast query case but this open problem has stayed unresolved. Here,
we disprove this conjecture. We give the first nontrivial lower bounds for semilagebraic range
searching and related problems. We show that any data structure for reporting the points between
two concentric circles with $Q(n)$ query time must use $S(n)=\Omega(n^{3-o(1)}/Q(n)^5)$ space,
meaning, for $Q(n)=O(\log^{O(1)}n)$, $\Omega(n^{3-o(1)})$ space must be used. We also study
the problem of reporting the points between two polynomials of form $Y=\sum_{i=0}^\Delta a_i X^i$
where $a_0, \cdots, a_\Delta$ are given at the query time. We show $S(n)=\Omega(n^{\Delta+1-o(1)}/Q(n)^{\Delta^2+\Delta})$.
So for $Q(n)=O(\log^{O(1)}n)$, we must use $\Omega(n^{\Delta+1-o(1)})$ space. For the dual semialgebraic
stabbing problems, we show that in linear space, any data structure that solves 2D ring stabbing
must use $\Omega(n^{2/3})$ query time. This almost matches the linearization upper bound. For
general semialgebraic slab stabbing problems, again, we show an almost tight lower bounds.

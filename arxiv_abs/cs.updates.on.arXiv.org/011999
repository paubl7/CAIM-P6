Knowledge extraction, typically studied in the classical setting, is at the heart of several cryptographic
protocols. We introduce the notion of secure quantum extraction protocols. A secure quantum extraction
protocol for an NP relation $\mathcal{R}$ is a classical interactive protocol between a sender
and a receiver, where the sender gets the instance $z$ and a witness $w$, while the receiver only gets
the instance $z$. For any efficient quantum adversarial sender (who follows the protocol but can
choose its own randomness), there exists a quantum extractor that can extract a witness $w'$ such
that $(z,w') \in \mathcal{R}$ while a malicious receiver should not be able to output any valid witness.
We study and construct two types of secure quantum extraction protocols. (1) Quantum extraction
protocols secure against quantum malicious receivers based on quantum fully homomorphic encryption
satisfying some mild properties and quantum hardness of learning with errors. In this construction,
we introduce a non black box technique in the quantum setting. All previous extraction techniques
in the quantum setting were solely based on quantum rewinding. (2) Quantum extraction protocols
secure against classical malicious receivers based on quantum hardness of learning with errors.
As an application, based on the quantum hardness of learning with errors, we present a construction
of constant round quantum zero-knowledge argument systems for NP that guarantee security even
against quantum malicious verifiers; however, our soundness only holds against classical probabilistic
polynomial time adversaries. Prior to our work, such protocols were known based, additionally,
on the assumptions of decisional Diffie-Hellman (or other cryptographic assumptions that do not
hold against polynomial time quantum algorithms).

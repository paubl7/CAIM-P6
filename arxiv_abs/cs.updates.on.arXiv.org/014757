Spectral measures arise in numerous applications such as quantum mechanics, signal processing,
resonances, and fluid stability. Similarly, spectral decompositions (pure point, absolutely
continuous and singular continuous) often characterise relevant physical properties such as
long-time dynamics of quantum systems. Despite new results on computing spectra, there remains
no general method able to compute spectral measures or spectral decompositions of infinite-dimensional
normal operators. Previous efforts focus on specific examples where analytical formulae are available
(or perturbations thereof) or on classes of operators with a lot of structure. Hence the general
computational problem is predominantly open. We solve this problem by providing the first set of
general algorithms that compute spectral measures and decompositions of a wide class of operators.
Given a matrix representation of a self-adjoint or unitary operator, such that each column decays
at infinity at a known asymptotic rate, we show how to compute spectral measures and decompositions.
We discuss how these methods allow the computation of objects such as the functional calculus, and
how they generalise to a large class of partial differential operators, allowing, for example,
solutions to evolution PDEs such as Schr\"odinger equations on $L^2(\mathbb{R}^d)$. Computational
spectral problems in infinite dimensions have led to the SCI hierarchy, which classifies the difficulty
of computational problems. We classify computation of measures, measure decompositions, types
of spectra, functional calculus, and Radon--Nikodym derivatives in the SCI hierarchy. The new
algorithms are demonstrated to be efficient on examples taken from OPs on the real line and the unit
circle (e.g. giving computational realisations of Favard's theorem and Verblunsky's theorem),
and are applied to evolution equations on a 2D quasicrystal.

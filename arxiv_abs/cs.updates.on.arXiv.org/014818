Context: Conflicts between software requirements bring uncertainties to product development.
Some great approaches have been proposed to identify these conflicts. However, they usually require
the software requirements represented with specific templates and/or depend on other external
source which is often uneasy to build for lots of projects in practice. Objective: We aim to propose
an approach Finer Semantic Analysis-based Requirements Conflict Detector (FSARC) to automatically
detecting the conflicts between the given natural language functional requirements by analyzing
their finer semantic compositions. Method: We build a harmonized semantic meta-model of functional
requirements with the form of eight-tuple. Then we propose algorithms to automatically analyze
the linguistic features of requirements and to annotate the semantic elements for their semantic
model construction. And we define seven types of conflicts as long as their heuristic detecting
rules on the ground of their text pattern and semantical dependency. Finally, we design and implement
the algorithm for conflicts detection. Results: The experiment with four requirement datasets
illustrates that the recall of FSARC is nearly 100% and the average precision is 83.88% on conflicts
detection. Conclusion: We provide a useful tool for detecting the conflicts between natural language
functional requirements to improve the quality of the final requirements set. Besides, our approach
is capable of transforming the natural language functional requirements into eight semantic tuples,
which is useful not only the detection of the conflicts between requirements but also some other
tasks such as constructing the association between requirements and so on.

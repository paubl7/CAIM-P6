Classic asset management approaches begin by inventorying all infrastructure assets and then
assigning maintenance tasks and resources. Our approach collects similar data, but by starting
with current personnel assignment and describing their job responsibilities and work processes,
staff resistance in a railroad infrastructure owner-operator environment is minimized. Resulting
"manning model" quantitatively measures signal maintenance burden including Federally mandated
tests, trouble tickets, non-FRA maintenance, overhead and vacation coverage, location/shift
assignment, administrative process, and work curfew productivity losses. It is capable of delivering
immediate results by rightsizing allocation of workforce across shifts and maintenance base locations--even
before all assets are formally inventoried. Typical data from a commuter passenger railroad shows
that work curfews and shift assignment constraints have significant impacts on workforce productivity.
Just over half of signal maintenance employee-hours are devoted to Federally mandated tests, whilst
non-FRA and repair maintenance consumes about 25% each. These indicators provide intelligence
driving strategic management actions to improve signal maintenance cost-effectiveness. This
model provides workload-based employee assignment by craft, location, gang, and shift for maintenance
manager use, but also provides analytical basis for establishing or abolishing positions in the
budgeting process. Comparing its results with current employee payroll provides a measure of how
much staffing stress the maintenance organization is under, which can help measure whether the
current overtime usage is appropriate. Asset and maintenance task inventories collected in this
process can also feed normal asset management processes to assess replacement cycles, asset failure
risk, and to inform strategic and investment decisions.

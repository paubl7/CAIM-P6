High-speed, low latency, and heterogeneity features of 5G, as the common denominator of many emerging
and classic wireless applications, have put wireless technology back in the spotlight. Continuous
connectivity requirement in low-power and wide-reach networks underlines the need for more efficient
routing over scarce wireless resources, in multi-hp scenarios. In this regard, Opportunistic
Routing (OR), which utilizes the broadcast nature of wireless media to provide transmission cooperation
amongst a selected number of overhearing nodes, has become more promising than ever. Crucial to
the overall network performance, which nodes to participate and where they stand on the transmission-priority
hierarchy, are decided by user-defined OR metrics embedded in OR protocols. Therefore, the task
of choosing or designing an appropriate OR metric is a critical one. The numerousness, proprietary
notations, and the objective variousness of OR metrics can cause the interested researcher to lose
insight and become overwhelmed, making the metric selection or design effort-intensive. While
there are not any comprehensive OR metrics surveys in the literature, those who partially address
the subject are non-exhaustive and lacking in detail. Furthermore, they offer limited insight
regarding related taxonomy and future research recommendations. In this paper, starting with
a custom tutorial with a new look to OR and OR metrics, we devise a new framework for OR metric design.
Introducing a new taxonomy enables us to take a structured, investigative, and comparative approach
to OR metrics, supported by extensive simulations. Exhaustive coverage of OR metrics, formulated
in a unified notation, is presented with sufficient details. Self-explanatory, easy-to-grasp,
and visual-friendly quick references are provided, which can be used independently from the rest
of the paper.

To investigate whether the pleurae, airways and vessels surrounding a nodule on non-contrast computed
tomography (CT) can discriminate benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. The LIDC-IDRI dataset,
one of the largest publicly available CT database, was exploited for study. A total of 1556 nodules
from 694 patients were involved in statistical analysis, where nodules with average scorings <3
and >3 were respectively denoted as benign and malignant. Besides, 339 nodules from 113 patients
with diagnosis ground-truth were independently evaluated. Computer algorithms were developed
to segment pulmonary structures and quantify the distances to pleural surface, airways and vessels,
as well as the counting number and normalized volume of airways and vessels near a nodule. Odds ratio
(OR) and Chi-square (\chi^2) testing were performed to demonstrate the correlation between features
of surrounding structures and nodule malignancy. A non-parametric receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) analysis was conducted in logistic regression to evaluate discrimination ability of each
structure. For benign and malignant groups, the average distances from nodules to pleural surface,
airways and vessels are respectively (6.56, 5.19), (37.08, 26.43) and (1.42, 1.07) mm. The correlation
between nodules and the counting number of airways and vessels that contact or project towards nodules
are respectively (OR=22.96, \chi^2=105.04) and (OR=7.06, \chi^2=290.11). The correlation between
nodules and the volume of airways and vessels are (OR=9.19, \chi^2=159.02) and (OR=2.29, \chi^2=55.89).
The areas-under-curves (AUCs) for pleurae, airways and vessels are respectively 0.5202, 0.6943
and 0.6529. Our results show that malignant nodules are often surrounded by more pulmonary structures
compared with benign ones, suggesting that features of these structures could be viewed as lung
cancer biomarkers.

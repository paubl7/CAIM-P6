Since the 2000's, an increased number of nanosatellites have accessed space. However, studies
show that the number of unsuccessful nanosatellite missions is very expressive. Moreover, these
statistics are correlated to poor verification and validation processes used by hobbyists satellite
developers because major space agencies keep high successful ratings even with small/nano satellites
missions due to its rigorous V\&V processes. Aiming to improve payloads integration testing of
NanosatC-BR-2, a 2-U Cubesat based nanosatellite under development by INPE, the fault injection
technique has been used. It is very useful technique to test systems prototypes. We present the design
and implementation of a Failure Emulator Mechanism (FEM) on I2C communication bus for testing the
interaction among the NCBR2 subsystems, supporting interoperability and robustness requirements
verification. The FEM is modelled to work at the communication bus emulating eventual faults of
the communicating subsystems in the messages exchanged. Using an Arduino board for the FEM and NI
LabView environment it is possible to program the mechanism to inject different faults at the I2C
bus during different operation modes. Based on a serial architecture, the FEM will be able to intercept
all messages and implement different faults as service and timing faults. The FEM interface with
the tester is designed in LabView environment. Control and observation facilities are available
to generate and upload the faultload script to FEM Arduino board. The proposed FEM architecture
and its implementation are validated using two subsystems under testing prototypes: the OnBoard
Data Handling Computer and the Langmuir Probe NCBR2 payload. For this analysis purpose, the prototypes
simulate in two different Arduinos boards the expected behavior of each subsystem in the communication.

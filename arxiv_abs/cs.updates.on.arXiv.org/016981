Crew Pairing Optimization (CPO) is critical for an airlines' business viability, given that the
crew operating cost is second only to the fuel cost. CPO aims at generating a set of flight sequences
(crew pairings) to cover all scheduled flights, at minimum cost, while satisfying several legality
constraints. The state-of-the-art heavily relies on relaxing the underlying Integer Programming
Problem into a Linear Programming Problem, which in turn is solved through the Column Generation
(CG) technique. However, with the alarmingly expanding airlines' operations, CPO is marred by
the curse of dimensionality, rendering the exact CG-implementations obsolete, and necessitating
the heuristic-based CG-implementations. Yet, in literature, the much prevalent large-scale
complex flight networks involving multiple { crew bases and/or hub-and-spoke sub-networks, largely
remain uninvestigated. This paper proposes a novel CG heuristic, which has enabled the in-house
development of an Airline Crew Pairing Optimizer (AirCROP). The efficacy of the heuristic/AirCROP
has been tested on real-world, large-scale, complex network instances with over 4,200 flights,
15 crew bases, and multiple hub-and-spoke sub-networks (resulting in billion-plus possible pairings).
Notably, this paper has a dedicated focus on the proposed CG heuristic (not the entire AirCROP framework)
based on balancing random exploration of pairings; exploitation of domain knowledge (on optimal
solution features); and utilization of the past computational & search effort through archiving.
Though this paper has an airline context, the proposed CG heuristic may find wider applications
across different domains, by serving as a template on how to utilize domain knowledge to better tackle
combinatorial optimization problems.

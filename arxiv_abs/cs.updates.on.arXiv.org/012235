Pandemics such as COVID-19 have lethal potential for inflicting long-lasting cyclic devastations
if required preventive, curative and reformative steps are not taken up in time which puts forth
mammoth multi-dimensional challenges for survival before mankind. Scientists and policymakers
all around are striving to achieve R $\leq$ 1 alongside having less number of CoVID-19 patients.
Lockdowns all across the globe have been implemented for the sake of social physical distancing.
However, even if the desired R value status is achieved it becomes nowhere near safe. As normal social
activity and inter-regional travel resumes, danger of contraction of the virus from undetected
asymptomatic carriers and reactivation of the virus in previously affected patients looms over.
The virus poses further threat due to its chances of resurgence, its mutative and adaptive nature
thereby giving limited medical respite. The problems intensify with increasing population density
whilst varying with several socio-economic-geo-cultural and human activity parameters. Such
zoonotic pandemics unravel the primary challenges of all countries in securing the general wellbeing
of the society. Ensuring a mechanism for policy designs envisaging crisis scenarios through continuous
analysis of real-time region-specific data about societal activities and disease/health indicators
can be the only solution. An approach perspective is discussed for addressing the tightly-coupled
UN Sustainable goals (2, 3, 6, 12 and 13) for developing a general-scale computational agent-based
model to estimate the downstream and upstream measures for achieving requisite societal behavioural
changes with the prognostic knowledge concerning the conditions and options for future scenarios
of stable sustainability.

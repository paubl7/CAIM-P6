Incentivized social advertising, an emerging marketing model, provides monetization opportunities
not only to the owners of the social networking platforms but also to their influential users by offering
a "cut" on the advertising revenue. We consider a social network (the host) that sells ad-engagements
to advertisers by inserting their ads, in the form of promoted posts, into the feeds of carefully
selected "initial endorsers" or seed users: these users receive monetary incentives in exchange
for their endorsements. The endorsements help propagate the ads to the feeds of their followers.
In this context, the problem for the host is is to allocate ads to influential users, taking into account
the propensity of ads for viral propagation, and carefully apportioning the monetary budget of
each of the advertisers between incentives to influential users and ad-engagement costs, with
the rational goal of maximizing its own revenue. We consider a monetary incentive for the influential
users, which is proportional to their influence potential. We show that revenue maximization in
incentivized social advertising corresponds to the problem of monotone submodular function maximization,
subject to a partition matroid constraint on the ads-to-seeds allocation, and submodular knapsack
constraints on the advertisers' budgets. This problem is NP-hard and we devise 2 greedy algorithms
with provable approximation guarantees, which differ in their sensitivity to seed user incentive
costs. Our approximation algorithms require repeatedly estimating the expected marginal gain
in revenue as well as in advertiser payment. By exploiting a connection to the recent advances made
in scalable estimation of expected influence spread, we devise efficient and scalable versions
of the greedy algorithms.

Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technology to enhance the energy- and spectrum-efficiency
of wireless powered communication networks (WPCNs). In this paper, we investigate an IRS-assisted
multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) WPCN, where the single-antenna wireless devices
(WDs) harvest wireless energy in the downlink (DL) and transmit their information simultaneously
in the uplink (UL) to a common hybrid access point (HAP) equipped with multiple antennas. Our goal
is to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) of all the energy-harvesting users. To make full use of
the beamforming gain provided by both the HAP and the IRS, we jointly optimize the active beamforming
of the HAP and the reflecting coefficients (passive beamforming) of the IRS in both DL and UL transmissions,
as well as the transmit power of the WDs to mitigate the inter-user interference at the HAP. To tackle
the challenging optimization problem, we first consider fixing the passive beamforming, and converting
the remaining joint active beamforming and user transmit power control problem into an equivalent
weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) problem, where we solve it using an efficient block-coordinate
descent (BCD) method. Then, we fix the active beamforming and user transmit power, and optimize
the passive beamforming coefficients of the IRS in both the DL and UL using a semidefinite relaxation
(SDR) method. Accordingly, we apply a block-structured optimization (BSO) method to update the
two sets of variables alternately. Numerical results show that the proposed joint optimization
achieves significant performance gain over other representative benchmark methods and effectively
improves the throughput performance in multiuser MISO WPCNs.

We apply deep-neural-network-based techniques to quantum state classification and reconstruction.
We demonstrate high classification accuracies and reconstruction fidelities, even in the presence
of noise and with little data. Using optical quantum states as examples, we first demonstrate how
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can successfully classify several types of states distorted
by, e.g., additive Gaussian noise or photon loss. We further show that a CNN trained on noisy inputs
can learn to identify the most important regions in the data, which potentially can reduce the cost
of tomography by guiding adaptive data collection. Secondly, we demonstrate reconstruction of
quantum-state density matrices using neural networks that incorporate quantum-physics knowledge.
The knowledge is implemented as custom neural-network layers that convert outputs from standard
feedforward neural networks to valid descriptions of quantum states. Any standard feed-forward
neural-network architecture can be adapted for quantum state tomography (QST) with our method.
We present further demonstrations of our proposed [arXiv:2008.03240] QST technique with conditional
generative adversarial networks (QST-CGAN). We motivate our choice of a learnable loss function
within an adversarial framework by demonstrating that the QST-CGAN outperforms, across a range
of scenarios, generative networks trained with standard loss functions. For pure states with additive
or convolutional Gaussian noise, the QST-CGAN is able to adapt to the noise and reconstruct the underlying
state. The QST-CGAN reconstructs states using up to two orders of magnitude fewer iterative steps
than a standard iterative maximum likelihood (iMLE) method. Further, the QST-CGAN can reconstruct
both pure and mixed states from two orders of magnitude fewer randomly chosen data points than iMLE.

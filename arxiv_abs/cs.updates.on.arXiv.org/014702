Given a set of sequences comprised of time-ordered events, sequential pattern mining is useful
to identify frequent subsequences from different sequences or within the same sequence. However,
in sport, these techniques cannot determine the importance of particular patterns of play to good
or bad outcomes, which is often of greater interest to coaches and performance analysts. In this
study, we apply a recently proposed supervised sequential pattern mining algorithm called safe
pattern pruning (SPP) to 490 labelled event sequences representing passages of play from one rugby
team's matches from the 2018 Japan Top League. We compare the SPP-obtained patterns that are the
most discriminative between scoring and non-scoring outcomes from both the team's and opposition
teams' perspectives, with the most frequent patterns obtained with well-known unsupervised sequential
pattern mining algorithms when applied to subsets of the original dataset, split on the label. Our
obtained results found that linebreaks, successful lineouts, regained kicks in play, repeated
phase-breakdown play, and failed exit plays by the opposition team were identified as as the patterns
that discriminated most between the team scoring and not scoring. Opposition team linebreaks,
errors made by the team, opposition team lineouts, and repeated phase-breakdown play by the opposition
team were identified as the patterns that discriminated most between the opposition team scoring
and not scoring. It was also found that, by virtue of its supervised nature as well as its pruning and
safe-screening properties, SPP obtained a greater variety of generally more sophisticated patterns
than the unsupervised models that are likely to be of more utility to coaches and performance analysts.

Monte Carlo simulations of quantum field theories on a lattice become increasingly expensive as
the continuum limit is approached since the cost per independent sample grows with a high power of
the inverse lattice spacing. Simulations on fine lattices suffer from critical slowdown, the rapid
growth of autocorrelations in the Markov chain. This causes a strong increase in the number of lattice
configurations that have to be generated to obtain statistically significant results. This paper
discusses hierarchical sampling methods to tame the growth in autocorrelations. Combined with
multilevel variance reduction, this significantly reduces the computational cost of simulations
for given tolerances $\epsilon_{\text{disc}}$ on the discretisation error and $\epsilon_{\text{stat}}$
on the statistical error. For observables with lattice errors of order $\alpha$ and integrated
autocorrelation times that grow like $\tau_{\mathrm{int}}\propto a^{-z}$, multilevel Monte
Carlo (MLMC) reduces the cost from $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\text{stat}}^{-2}\epsilon_{\text{disc}}^{-(1+z)/\alpha})$
to $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\text{stat}}^{-2}\vert\log \epsilon_{\text{disc}} \vert^2+\epsilon_{\text{disc}}^{-1/\alpha})$
or $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon_{\text{stat}}^{-2}+\epsilon_{\text{disc}}^{-1/\alpha})$. Higher
gains are expected for simulations of quantum field theories in $D$ dimensions. The efficiency
of the approach is demonstrated on two model systems, including a topological oscillator that is
badly affected by critical slowdown from topological charge freezing. On fine lattices, the new
methods are orders of magnitude faster than standard Hybrid Monte Carlo sampling. For high resolutions,
MLMC can be used to accelerate even the cluster algorithm for the topological oscillator. Performance
is further improved through perturbative matching which guarantees efficient coupling of theories
on the multilevel hierarchy.

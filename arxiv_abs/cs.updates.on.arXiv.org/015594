Quantum computing is an emerging paradigm with the potential to offer significant computational
advantage over conventional classical computing by exploiting quantum-mechanical principles
such as entanglement and superposition. It is anticipated that this computational advantage of
quantum computing will help to solve many complex and computationally intractable problems in
several areas such as drug design, data science, clean energy, finance, industrial chemical development,
secure communications, and quantum chemistry. In recent years, tremendous progress in both quantum
hardware development and quantum software/algorithm have brought quantum computing much closer
to reality. Indeed, the demonstration of quantum supremacy marks a significant milestone in the
Noisy Intermediate Scale Quantum (NISQ) era - the next logical step being the quantum advantage
whereby quantum computers solve a real-world problem much more efficiently than classical computing.
As the quantum devices are expected to steadily scale up in the next few years, quantum decoherence
and qubit interconnectivity are two of the major challenges to achieve quantum advantage in the
NISQ era. Quantum computing is a highly topical and fast-moving field of research with significant
ongoing progress in all facets. This article presents a comprehensive review of quantum computing
literature, and taxonomy of quantum computing. Further, the proposed taxonomy is used to map various
related studies to identify the research gaps. A detailed overview of quantum software tools and
technologies, post-quantum cryptography and quantum computer hardware development to document
the current state-of-the-art in the respective areas. We finish the article by highlighting various
open challenges and promising future directions for research.

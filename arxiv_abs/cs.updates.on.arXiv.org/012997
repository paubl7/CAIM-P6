A diverse team of engineers, artists, and algorithms, collaborated to create songs for SophiaPop,
via various neural networks, robotics technologies, and artistic tools, and animated the results
on Sophia the Robot, a robotic celebrity and animated character. Sophia is a platform for arts, research,
and other uses. To advance the art and technology of Sophia, we combine various AI with a fictional
narrative of her burgeoning career as a popstar. Her actual AI-generated pop lyrics, music, and
paintings, and animated conversations wherein she interacts with humans real-time in narratives
that discuss her experiences. To compose the music, SophiaPop team built corpora from human and
AI-generated Sophia character personality content, along with pop music song forms, to train and
provide seeds for a number of AI algorithms including expert models, and custom-trained transformer
neural networks, which then generated original pop-song lyrics and melodies. Our musicians including
Frankie Storm, Adam Pickrell, and Tiger Darrow, then performed interpretations of the AI-generated
musical content, including singing and instrumentation. The human-performed singing data then
was processed by a neural-network-based Sophia voice, which was custom-trained from human performances
by Cereproc. This AI then generated the unique Sophia voice singing of the songs. Then we animated
Sophia to sing the songs in music videos, using a variety of animation generators and human-generated
animations. Being algorithms and humans, working together, SophiaPop represents a human-AI collaboration,
aspiring toward human AI symbiosis. We believe that such a creative convergence of multiple disciplines
with humans and AI working together, can make AI relevant to human culture in new and exciting ways,
and lead to a hopeful vision for the future of human-AI relations.

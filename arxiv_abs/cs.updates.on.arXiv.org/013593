In this paper, two finite difference numerical schemes are proposed and analyzed for the droplet
liquid film model, with a singular Leonard-Jones energy potential involved. Both first and second
order accurate temporal algorithms are considered. In the first order scheme, the convex potential
and the surface diffusion terms are implicitly, while the concave potential term is updated explicitly.
Furthermore, we provide a theoretical justification that this numerical algorithm has a unique
solution, such that the positivity is always preserved for the phase variable at a point-wise level,
so that a singularity is avoided in the scheme. In fact, the singular nature of the Leonard-Jones
potential term around the value of 0 prevents the numerical solution reaching such singular value,
so that the positivity structure is always preserved. Moreover, an unconditional energy stability
of the numerical scheme is derived, without any restriction for the time step size. In the second
order numerical scheme, the BDF temporal stencil is applied, and an alternate convex-concave decomposition
is derived, so that the concave part corresponds to a quadratic energy. In turn, the combined Leonard-Jones
potential term is treated implicitly, and the concave part the is approximated by a second order
Adams-Bashforth explicit extrapolation, and an artificial Douglas-Dupont regularization term
is added to ensure the energy stability. The unique solvability and the positivity-preserving
property for the second order scheme could be similarly established. In addition, optimal rate
convergence analysis is provided for both the first and second order accurate schemes. A few numerical
simulation results are also presented, which demonstrate the robustness of the numerical schemes.

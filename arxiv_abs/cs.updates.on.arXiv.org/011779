Improving the energy efficiency of mobile applications is a topic that has gained a lot of attention
recently. It has been addressed in a number of ways such as identifying energy bugs and developing
a catalog of energy patterns. Previous work shows that users discuss the battery-related issues
(energy inefficiency or energy consumption) of the apps in their reviews. However, there is no work
that addresses the automatic extraction of battery-related issues from users' feedback. In this
paper, we report on a visualization tool that is developed to empirically study machine learning
algorithms and text features to automatically identify the energy consumption specific reviews
with the highest accuracy. Other than the common machine learning algorithms, we utilize deep learning
models with different word embeddings to compare the results. Furthermore, to help the developers
extract the main topics that are discussed in the reviews, two states of the art topic modeling algorithms
are applied. The visualizations of the topics represent the keywords that are extracted for each
topic along with a comparison with the results of string matching. The developed web-browser based
interactive visualization tool is a novel framework developed with the intention of giving the
app developers insights about running time and accuracy of machine learning and deep learning models
as well as extracted topics. The tool makes it easier for the developers to traverse through the extensive
result set generated by the text classification and topic modeling algorithms. The dynamic-data
structure used for the tool stores the baseline-results of the discussed approaches and is updated
when applied on new datasets. The tool is open-sourced to replicate the research results.

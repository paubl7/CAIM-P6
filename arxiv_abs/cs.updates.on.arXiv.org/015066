We present a real-world application that uses a quantum computer. Specifically, we train a restricted
Boltzmann machine (RBM) using quantum annealing (QA) for cybersecurity applications. The D-Wave
2000Q has been used to implement QA. RBMs are trained on the ISCX data, which is a benchmark dataset
for cybersecurity. For comparison, RBMs are also trained using contrastive divergence (CD). CD
is a commonly used method for RBM training. Our analysis of the ISCX data shows that the dataset is
imbalanced. We present two different schemes to balance the training dataset before feeding it
to a classifier. The first scheme is based on the undersampling of benign instances. The imbalanced
training dataset is divided into five sub-datasets that are trained separately. A majority voting
is then performed to get the result. Our results show the majority vote increases the classification
accuracy up from 90.24% to 95.68%, in the case of CD. For the case of QA, the classification accuracy
increases from 74.14% to 80.04%. In the second scheme, a RBM is used to generate synthetic data to
balance the training dataset. We show that both QA and CD-trained RBM can be used to generate useful
synthetic data. Balanced training data is used to evaluate several classifiers. Among the classifiers
investigated, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Neural Network (NN) perform better than other classifiers.
They both show an accuracy of 93%. Our results show a proof-of-concept that a QA-based RBM can be trained
on a 64-bit binary dataset. The illustrative example suggests the possibility to migrate many practical
classification problems to QA-based techniques. Further, we show that synthetic data generated
from a RBM can be used to balance the original dataset.

The new coronavirus 2019, also known as COVID19, is a very serious epidemic that has killed thousands
or even millions of people since December 2019. It was defined as a pandemic by the world health organization
in March 2020. It is stated that this virus is usually transmitted by droplets caused by sneezing
or coughing, or by touching infected surfaces. The presence of the virus is detected by real-time
reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) tests with the help of a swab taken from
the nose or throat. In addition, X-ray and CT imaging methods are also used to support this method.
Since it is known that the accuracy sensitivity in rRT-PCR test is low, auxiliary diagnostic methods
have a very important place. Computer-aided diagnosis and detection systems are developed especially
with the help of X-ray and CT images. Studies on the detection of COVID19 in the literature are increasing
day by day. In this study, the effect of different batch size (BH=3, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50) parameter
values on their performance in detecting COVID19 and other classes was investigated using data
belonging to 4 different (Viral Pneumonia, COVID19, Normal, Bacterial Pneumonia) classes. The
study was carried out using a pre-trained ResNet50 convolutional neural network. According to
the obtained results, they performed closely on the training and test data. However, it was observed
that the steady state in the test data was delayed as the batch size value increased. The highest COVID19
detection was 95.17% for BH = 3, while the overall accuracy value was 97.97% with BH = 20. According
to the findings, it can be said that the batch size value does not affect the overall performance significantly,
but the increase in the batch size value delays obtaining stable results.

The United States is the largest distributor of legal services in the world, representing a $437
billion market. Of this, corporate legal departments pay law firms $80 billion for their services.
Every month, legal departments receive and process invoices from these law firms and legal service
providers. Legal invoice review is and has been a pain point for corporate legal department leaders.
Complex and intricate, legal invoices often contain several hundred line-items that account for
anything from tasks such as hands-on legal work to expenses such as copying, meals, and travel. The
man-hours and scrutiny involved in the invoice review process can be overwhelming. Even with common
safeguards in place, such as established billing guidelines, experienced invoice reviewers (typically
highly paid in-house attorneys), and rule-based electronic billing tools ("e-billing"), many
discrepancies go undetected. Using machine learning, our goal is to demonstrate the current flaws
of, and to explore improvements to, the legal invoice review process for invoices submitted by law
firms to their corporate clients. In this work, we detail our approach, applying several machine
learning model architectures, for detecting anomalous invoice line-items based on their suitability
in the legal case's lifecycle (modeled using a set of case-level and invoice line-item-level features).
To overcome the challenge of unlabeled data, we generate a synthetic dataset which utilizes subject
matter expertise ("SME") to manipulate existing records' attributes to reflect an anomalous state
in the product lifecycle, and characterize our method's performance using a set of model architectures.
We demonstrate how this process advances solving anomaly detection problems, specifically when
the characteristics of the anomalies are well known, and offer lessons learned from applying our
approach to real-world data.

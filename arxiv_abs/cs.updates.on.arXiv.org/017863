This paper presents the development of systematic machine learning (ML) approach to enable explainable
and rapid assessment of fire resistance and fire-induced spalling of reinforced concrete (RC)
columns. The developed approach comprises of an ensemble of three novel ML algorithms namely; random
forest (RF), extreme gradient boosted trees (ExGBT), and deep learning (DL). These algorithms
are trained to account for a wide collection of geometric characteristics and material properties,
as well as loading conditions to examine fire performance of normal and high strength RC columns
by analyzing a comprehensive database of fire tests comprising of over 494 observations. The developed
ensemble is also capable of presenting quantifiable insights to ML predictions; thus, breaking
free from the notion of 'blackbox' ML and establishing a solid step towards transparent and explainable
ML. Most importantly, this work tackles the scarcity of available fire tests by proposing new techniques
to leverage the use of real, synthetic and augmented fire test observations. The developed ML ensemble
has been calibrated and validated for standard and design fire exposures and for one, two, three
and four-sided fire exposures thus; covering a wide range of practical scenarios present during
fire incidents. When fully deployed, the developed ensemble can analyze over 5,000 RC columns in
under 60 seconds thus, providing an attractive solution for researchers and practitioners. The
presented approach can also be easily extended for evaluating fire resistance and spalling of other
structural members and under varying fire scenarios and loading conditions and hence paves the
way to modernize the state of this research area and practice.

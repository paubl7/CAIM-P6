Android is currently the most extensively used smartphone platform in the world. Due to its popularity
and open source nature, Android malware has been rapidly growing in recent years, and bringing great
risks to users' privacy. The malware applications in a malware family may have common features and
similar behaviors, which are beneficial for malware detection and inspection. Thus, classifying
Android malware into their corresponding families is an important task in malware analysis. At
present, the main problem of existing research works on Android malware family classification
lies in that the extracted features are inadequate to represent the common behavior characteristics
of the malware in malicious families, and leveraging a single classifier or a static ensemble classifier
is restricted to further improve the accuracy of classification. In this paper, we propose DroidMFC,
a novel Android malware family classification scheme based on static analysis technology. In DroidMFC,
the explicit features including permissions, hardware components, app components, intent filters
are extracted from the apk files of a malware application. Besides, a hidden feature generated from
the extracted APIs is used to represents the API call relationship in the application. Then, we design
an adaptive weighted ensemble classifier, which considers the adaptability of the sample to each
base classifier, to carry out accurate malware family classification. We conducted experiments
on the Drebin dataset which contains 5560 Android malicious applications. The superiority of DroidMFC
is demonstrated through comparing it with 5 traditional machine learning models and 4 state-of-the-art
reference schemes. DroidMFC can correctly classify 98.92% of malware samples into their families
and achieve 99.12% F1-Score.

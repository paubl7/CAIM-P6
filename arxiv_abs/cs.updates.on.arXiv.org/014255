In this paper, a third-order compact gas-kinetic scheme (GKS) on unstructured tetrahedral mesh
is constructed for the compressible Euler and Navier-Stokes solutions. The time-dependent gas
distribution function at a cell interface is used to calculate the fluxes for the updating the cell-averaged
flow variables and to evaluate the time accurate cell-averaged flow variables as well for evolving
the cell-averaged gradients of flow variables. With the accurate evolution model for both flow
variables and their slopes, the quality of the scheme depends closely on the accuracy and reliability
of the initial reconstruction of flow variables. The reconstruction scheme becomes more challenge
on tetrahedral mesh, where the conventional second-order unlimited least-square reconstruction
can make the scheme be linearly unstable when using cell-averaged conservative variables alone
with von Neumann neighbors. Benefiting from the evolved cell-averaged slopes, on tetrahedral
mesh the GKS is linearly stable from a compact third-order smooth reconstruction with a large CFL
number. In order to further increase the robustness of the high-order compact GKS for capturing
discontinuous solution, a new two-step multi-resolution weighted essentially non-oscillatory
(WENO) reconstruction will be proposed. The novelty of the reconstruction includes the following.
Firstly, it releases the stability issue from a second-order compact reconstruction through the
introduction of a pre-reconstruction step. Secondly, in the third-order non-linear reconstruction,
only one more large stencil is added beside those in the second-order one, which significantly simplifies
the high-order reconstruction. The proposed third-order scheme shows good robustness in high
speed flow computation and favorable mesh adaptability in cases with complex geometry.

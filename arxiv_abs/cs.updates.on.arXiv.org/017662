We revisit the minimum dominating set problem on graphs with arboricity bounded by $\alpha$. Bansal
and Umboh [BU17] gave an $O(\alpha)$-approximation LP rounding algorithm, which also translates
into a near-linear time algorithm using general-purpose approximation results for explicit mixed
packing and covering or pure covering LPs [KY14, You14, AZO19, Qua10]. Moreover, [BU17] showed
that it is NP-hard to achieve an asymptotic improvement for the approximation factor. On the other
hand, the previous two non-LP-based algorithms, by Lenzen and Wattenhofer [LW10], and Jones et
al. [JLR+13], achieve an approximation factor of $O(\alpha^2)$ in linear time. There is a similar
situation in the distributed setting: While there is an $O(\log^2 n)$-round LP-based $O(\alpha)$-approximation
algorithm implied in [KMW06], the best non-LP-based algorithm by Lenzen and Wattenhofer [LW10]
is an implementation of their centralized algorithm, providing an $O(\alpha^2)$-approximation
within $O(\log n)$ rounds. We address the questions of whether one can achieve an $O(\alpha)$-approximation
algorithm that is not LP-based, either in the centralized setting or in the distributed setting.
We resolve both questions in the affirmative, and en route achieve algorithms that are faster than
the state-of-the-art LP-based algorithms. More specifically, our contribution is two-fold:
1. In the centralized setting, we provide a surprisingly simple combinatorial algorithm that is
asymptotically optimal in terms of both approximation factor and running time: an $O(\alpha)$-approximation
in linear time. 2. Based on our centralized algorithm, we design a distributed combinatorial $O(\alpha)$-approximation
algorithm in the CONGEST model that runs in $O(\alpha\log n )$ rounds with high probability.

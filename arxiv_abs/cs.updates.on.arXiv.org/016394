We investigate the complexity of explicit construction problems, where the goal is to produce a
particular object of size $n$ possessing some pseudorandom property in time polynomial in $n$.
We give overwhelming evidence that ${\bf APEPP}$, defined originally by Kleinberg et al., is the
natural complexity class associated with explicit constructions for objects whose existence
follows from the probabilistic method, by proving that a host of well-studied explicit construction
problems lie in this class. We then observe that a result of Je\v{r}\'{a}bek on provability in Bounded
Arithmetic, when reinterpreted as a reduction between search problems, shows that constructing
a truth table of high circuit complexity is complete for ${\bf APEPP}$ under ${\bf P}^{\bf NP}$ reductions.
This demonstrates that constructing a hard truth table is a universal explicit construction problem
in a concrete sense. This result in fact gives a precise algorithmic characterization of proving
$2^{\Omega(n)}$ circuit lower bounds for ${\bf E}^{\bf NP}$: the complete problem for ${\bf APEPP}$
has a ${\bf P}^{\bf NP}$ algorithm if and only if such a lower bound holds. Together with our proof
that pseudorandom generators can be constructed in ${\bf APEPP}$, this also yields a self-contained
and significantly simplified proof of the celebrated result of Impagliazzo and Wigderson that
worst-case-hard truth tables can be used to derandomize algorithms (although the conclusion is
weaker as our derandomization requires an ${\bf NP}$ oracle). As another corollary of this completeness
result, we show that ${\bf E}^{\bf NP}$ contains a language of circuit complexity $2^{\Omega(n)}$
if and only if it contains a language of circuit complexity $\frac{2^n}{3n}$. Finally, for several
of the problems shown to lie in ${\bf APEPP}$, we demonstrate direct polynomial time reductions
to the explicit construction of hard truth tables.

Since late 2019, COVID-19 has been spreading over the world and caused the death of many people. The
high transmission rate of the virus demands the rapid identification of infected patients to reduce
the spread of the disease. The current gold-standard test, Reverse-Transcription Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), suffers from a high rate of false negatives. Diagnosis from CT-scan images
as an alternative with higher accuracy and sensitivity has the challenge of distinguishing COVID-19
from other lung diseases which demand expert radiologists. In peak times, artificial intelligence
(AI) based diagnostic systems can help radiologists to accelerate the process of diagnosis, increase
the accuracy, and understand the severity of the disease. We designed an interpretable deep neural
network to distinguish healthy people, patients with COVID-19, and patients with other lung diseases
from chest CT-scan images. Our model also detects the infected areas of the lung and is able to calculate
the percentage of the infected volume. We preprocessed the images to eliminate the batch effect
related to CT-scan devices and medical centers and then adopted a weakly supervised method to train
the model without having any label for infected parts and any tags for the slices of the CT-scan images
that had signs of disease. We trained and evaluated the model on a large dataset of 3359 CT-scan images
from 6 medical centers. The model reached a sensitivity of 97.75% and a specificity of 87% in separating
healthy people from the diseased and a sensitivity of 98.15% and a specificity of 81.03% in distinguishing
COVID-19 from other diseases. The model also reached similar metrics in 1435 samples from 6 unseen
medical centers that prove its generalizability. The performance of the model on a large diverse
dataset, its generalizability, and interpretability makes it suitable to be used as a diagnostic
system.

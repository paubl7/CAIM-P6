In this paper, we study the single-source shortest-path (SSSP) problem with positive edge weights,
which is a notoriously hard problem in the parallel context. In practice, the $\Delta$-stepping
algorithm proposed by Meyer and Sanders has been widely adopted. However, $\Delta$-stepping has
no known worst-case bounds for general graphs. The performance of $\Delta$-stepping also highly
relies on the parameter $\Delta$. There have also been lots of algorithms with theoretical bounds,
such as Radius-stepping, but they either have no implementations available or are much slower than
$\Delta$-stepping in practice. We propose a stepping algorithm framework that generalizes existing
algorithms such as $\Delta$-stepping and Radius-stepping. The framework allows for similar analysis
and implementations of all stepping algorithms. We also propose a new ADT, lazy-batched priority
queue (LaB-PQ), that abstracts the semantics of the priority queue needed by the stepping algorithms.
We provide two data structures for LaB-PQ, focusing on theoretical and practical efficiency, respectively.
Based on the new framework and LaB-PQ, we show two new stepping algorithms, $\rho$-stepping and
$\Delta^*$-stepping, that are simple, with non-trivial worst-case bounds, and fast in practice.
The stepping algorithm framework also provides almost identical implementations for three algorithms:
Bellman-Ford, $\Delta^*$-stepping, and $\rho$-stepping. We compare our code with four state-of-the-art
implementations. On five social and web graphs, $\rho$-stepping is 1.3--2.5x faster than all the
existing implementations. On two road graphs, our $\Delta^*$-stepping is at least 14\% faster
than existing implementations, while $\rho$-stepping is also competitive. The almost identical
implementations for stepping algorithms also allow for in-depth analyses and comparisons among
the stepping algorithms in practice.

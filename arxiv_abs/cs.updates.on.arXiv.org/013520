Condominium network refers to intra-organization networks, where smart buildings or apartments
are connected and share resources over the network. Secured communication platform or channel
has been highlighted as a key requirement for a reliable condominium which can be ensured by the utilization
of the advanced techniques and platforms like Software-Defined Network (SDN), Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) and Blockchain (BC). These technologies provide a robust, and secured platform
to meet all kinds of challenges, such as safety, confidentiality, flexibility, efficiency, and
availability. This work suggests a distributed, scalable IoT-SDN with Blockchain-based NFV framework
for a smart condominium (DistB-Condo) that can act as an efficient secured platform for a small community.
Moreover, the Blockchain-based IoT-SDN with NFV framework provides the combined benefits of leading
technologies. It also presents an optimized Cluster Head Selection (CHS) algorithm for selecting
a Cluster Head (CH) among the clusters that efficiently saves energy. Besides, a decentralized
and secured Blockchain approach has been introduced that allows more prominent security and privacy
to the desired condominium network. Our proposed approach has also the ability to detect attacks
in an IoT environment. Eventually, this article evaluates the performance of the proposed architecture
using different parameters (e.g., throughput, packet arrival rate, and response time). The proposed
approach outperforms the existing OF-Based SDN. DistB-Condo has better throughput on average,
and the bandwidth (Mbps) much higher than the OF-Based SDN approach in the presence of attacks. Also,
the proposed model has an average response time of 5% less than the core model.

Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an emerging respiratory disease caused by the severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) with rapid human-to-human transmission and
a high case fatality rate particularly in older patients. Due to the exponential growth of infections,
many healthcare systems across the world are under pressure to care for increasing amounts of at-risk
patients. Given the high number of infected patients, identifying patients with the highest mortality
risk early is critical to enable effective intervention and optimal prioritisation of care. Here,
we present the COVID-19 Early Warning System (CovEWS), a clinical risk scoring system for assessing
COVID-19 related mortality risk. CovEWS provides continuous real-time risk scores for individual
patients with clinically meaningful predictive performance up to 192 hours (8 days) in advance,
and is automatically derived from patients' electronic health records (EHRs) using machine learning.
We trained and evaluated CovEWS using de-identified data from a cohort of 66430 COVID-19 positive
patients seen at over 69 healthcare institutions in the United States (US), Australia, Malaysia
and India amounting to an aggregated total of over 2863 years of patient observation time. On an external
test cohort of 5005 patients, CovEWS predicts COVID-19 related mortality from $78.8\%$ ($95\%$
confidence interval [CI]: $76.0$, $84.7\%$) to $69.4\%$ ($95\%$ CI: $57.6, 75.2\%$) specificity
at a sensitivity greater than $95\%$ between respectively 1 and 192 hours prior to observed mortality
events - significantly outperforming existing generic and COVID-19 specific clinical risk scores.
CovEWS could enable clinicians to intervene at an earlier stage, and may therefore help in preventing
or mitigating COVID-19 related mortality.

Signal processing, communications, and control have traditionally relied on classical statistical
modeling techniques. Such model-based methods utilize mathematical formulations that represent
the underlying physics, prior information and additional domain knowledge. Simple classical
models are useful but sensitive to inaccuracies and may lead to poor performance when real systems
display complex or dynamic behavior. On the other hand, purely data-driven approaches that are
model-agnostic are becoming increasingly popular as datasets become abundant and the power of
modern deep learning pipelines increases. Deep neural networks (DNNs) use generic architectures
which learn to operate from data, and demonstrate excellent performance, especially for supervised
problems. However, DNNs typically require massive amounts of data and immense computational resources,
limiting their applicability for some signal processing scenarios. We are interested in hybrid
techniques that combine principled mathematical models with data-driven systems to benefit from
the advantages of both approaches. Such model-based deep learning methods exploit both partial
domain knowledge, via mathematical structures designed for specific problems, as well as learning
from limited data. In this article we survey the leading approaches for studying and designing model-based
deep learning systems. We divide hybrid model-based/data-driven systems into categories based
on their inference mechanism. We provide a comprehensive review of the leading approaches for combining
model-based algorithms with deep learning in a systematic manner, along with concrete guidelines
and detailed signal processing oriented examples from recent literature. Our aim is to facilitate
the design and study of future systems on the intersection of signal processing and machine learning
that incorporate the advantages of both domains.

Background: The evolution of symptoms over time is at the heart of understanding and treating mental
disorders. However, a principled, quantitative framework explaining symptom dynamics remains
elusive. Here, we propose a Network Control Theory of Psychopathology allowing us to formally derive
a theoretical control energy which we hypothesize quantifies resistance to future symptom improvement
in Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). We test this hypothesis and investigate the relation to genetic
and environmental risk as well as resilience. Methods: We modelled longitudinal symptom-network
dynamics derived from N=2,059 Beck Depression Inventory measurements acquired over a median of
134 days in a sample of N=109 patients suffering from MDD. We quantified the theoretical energy required
for each patient and time-point to reach a symptom-free state given individual symptom-network
topology (E 0 ) and 1) tested if E 0 predicts future symptom improvement and 2) whether this relationship
is moderated by Polygenic Risk Scores (PRS) of mental disorders, childhood maltreatment experience,
and self-reported resilience. Outcomes: We show that E 0 indeed predicts symptom reduction at the
next measurement and reveal that this coupling between E 0 and future symptom change increases with
higher genetic risk and childhood maltreatment while it decreases with resilience. Interpretation:
Our study provides a mechanistic framework capable of predicting future symptom improvement based
on individual symptom-network topology and clarifies the role of genetic and environmental risk
as well as resilience. Our control-theoretic framework makes testable, quantitative predictions
for individual therapeutic response and provides a starting-point for the theory-driven design
of personalized interventions. Funding: German Research Foundation and Interdisciplinary Centre

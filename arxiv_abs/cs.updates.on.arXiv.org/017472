Online Social Networks represent a novel opportunity for political campaigns, revolutionising
the paradigm of political communication. Nevertheless, many studies uncovered the presence of
d/misinformation campaigns or of malicious activities by genuine or automated users, putting
at severe risk the credibility of online platforms. This phenomenon is particularly evident during
crucial political events, as political elections. In the present paper, we provide a comprehensive
description of the structure of the networks of interactions among users and bots during the UK elections
of 2019. In particular, we focus on the polarised discussion about Brexit on Twitter analysing a
data set made of more than 10 million tweets posted for over a month. We found that the presence of automated
accounts fostered the debate particularly in the days before the UK national elections, in which
we find a steep increase of bots in the discussion; in the days after the election day, their incidence
returned to values similar to the ones observed few weeks before the elections. On the other hand,
we found that the number of suspended users (i.e. accounts that were removed by the platform for some
violation of the Twitter policy) remained constant until the election day, after which it reached
significantly higher values. Remarkably, after the TV debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy
Corbyn, we observed the injection of a large number of novel bots whose behaviour is markedly different
from that of pre-existing ones. Finally, we explored the bots' stance, finding that their activity
is spread across the whole political spectrum, although in different proportions, and we studied
the different usage of hashtags by automated accounts and suspended users, thus targeting the formation
of common narratives in different sides of the debate.

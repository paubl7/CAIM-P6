This paper presents experimental results that validate eco-driving and eco-heating strategies
developed for connected and automated vehicles (CAVs). By exploiting vehicle-to-infrastructure
(V2I) communications, traffic signal timing, and queue length estimations, optimized and smoothed
speed profiles for the ego-vehicle are generated to reduce energy consumption. Next, the planned
eco-trajectories are incorporated into a real-time predictive optimization framework that coordinates
the cabin thermal load (in cold weather) with the speed preview, i.e., eco-heating. To enable eco-heating,
the engine coolant (as the only heat source for cabin heating) and the cabin air are leveraged as two
thermal energy storages. Our eco-heating strategy stores thermal energy in the engine coolant
and cabin air while the vehicle is driving at high speeds, and releases the stored energy slowly during
the vehicle stops for cabin heating without forcing the engine to idle to provide the heating source.
To test and validate these solutions, a power-split hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) has been instrumented
for cabin thermal management, allowing to regulate heating, ventilation, and air conditioning
(HVAC) system inputs (cabin temperature setpoint and blower flow rate) in real-time. Experiments
were conducted to demonstrate the energy-saving benefits of eco-driving and eco-heating strategies
over real-world city driving cycles at different cold ambient temperatures. The data confirmed
average fuel savings of 14.5% and 4.7% achieved by eco-driving and eco-heating, respectively,
offering a combined energy saving of more than 19% when comparing to the baseline vehicle driven
by a human driver with a constant-heating strategy.

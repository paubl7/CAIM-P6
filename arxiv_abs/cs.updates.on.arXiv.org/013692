Background: Software project management courses are becoming popular for teaching software engineering
process models and methods. In order to be effective, this approach should be properly aligned with
the learning outcomes. Common misalignments are caused by using an incorrect degree of realism
or inappropriate support. Objective: Design, implement and evaluate a learning approach that
helps students acquire knowledge (theoretical and practical) and enables them to solve similar
challenges to the ones they will face in real-world software projects. Methods: Our proposed approach
combines i) a serious game and ii) a design-implement task where the students face the development
of a controlled-scale software development project. Students were required to plan and manage
a software project according to its specification provided by the teachers. To evaluate the approach,
we collected the student's perceptions through an online survey, analyzed the adherence of their
project plans to a set of rubrics that drive the serious game, and analyzed the teams' reports submitted
at the end of the course. Results: The students' perception suggests that the integrated approach
promotes knowledge acquisition through practical learning, and reinforces the theoretical knowledge
of the course, and that is aligned with the main learning outcomes of the course. Students were also
able to reflect and make meaningful inferences about the application of theory in a real-life context.
Conclusion: The experiential learning approach matches the intended objectives and reinforces
a software project management course's theoretical knowledge. Our experience also points out
insightful lessons for educators willing to apply such an integrated approach in software engineering
curricula.

We introduce a "system-wide safety staffing" (SWSS) parameter for multiclass multi-pool networks
of any tree topology, Markovian or non-Markovian, in the Halfin-Whitt regime. This parameter can
be regarded as the optimal reallocation of the capacity fluctuations (positive or negative) of
order $\sqrt{n}$ when each server pool employs a square-root staffing rule. We provide an explicit
form of the SWSS as a function of the system parameters, which is derived using a graph theoretic approach
based on Gaussian elimination. For Markovian networks, we give an equivalent characterization
of the SWSS parameter via the drift parameters of the limiting diffusion. We show that if the SWSS
parameter is negative, the limiting diffusion and the diffusion-scaled queueing processes are
transient under any Markov control, and cannot have a stationary distribution when this parameter
is zero. If it is positive, we show that the diffusion-scaled queueing processes are uniformly stabilizable,
that is, there exists a scheduling policy under which the stationary distributions of the controlled
processes are tight over the size of the network. In addition, there exists a control under which
the limiting controlled diffusion is exponentially ergodic. Thus we have identified a necessary
and sufficient condition for the uniform stabilizability of such networks in the Halfin-Whitt
regime. We use a constant control resulting from the leaf elimination algorithm to stabilize the
limiting controlled diffusion, while a family of Markov scheduling policies which are easy to compute
are used to stabilize the diffusion-scaled processes. Finally, we show that under these controls
the processes are exponentially ergodic and the stationary distributions have exponential tails.

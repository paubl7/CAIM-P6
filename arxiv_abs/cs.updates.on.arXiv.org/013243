Modern communication systems organize receivers in blocks in order to simplify their analysis
and design. However, an approach that considers the receiver design from a wider perspective rather
than treating it block-by-block may take advantage of the impacts of these blocks on each other and
provide better performance. Herein, we can benefit from machine learning and compose a receiver
model implementing supervised learning techniques. With this motivation, we consider a one-to-one
transmission system over a flat fast fading wireless channel and propose a support vector machines
(SVM)-based receiver that combines the pilot-based channel estimation, data demodulation and
decoding processes in one joint operation. We follow two techniques in the receiver design. We first
design one SVM-based classifier that outputs the class of the encoding codeword that enters the
encoder at the transmitter side. Then, we put forward a model with one SVM-based classifier per one
bit in the encoding codeword, where each classifier assigns the value of the corresponding bit in
the encoding vector. With the second technique, we simplify the receiver design especially for
longer encoding codewords. We show that the SVM-based receiver performs very closely to the maximum
likelihood decoder, which is known to be the optimal decoding strategy when the encoding vectors
at the transmitter are equally likely. We further show that the SVM-based receiver outperforms
the conventional receivers that perform channel estimation, data demodulation and decoding in
blocks. Finally, we show that we can train the SVM-based receiver with 1-bit analog-to-digital
converter (ADC) outputs and the SVM-based receiver can perform very closely to the conventional
receivers that take 32-bit ADC outputs as inputs.

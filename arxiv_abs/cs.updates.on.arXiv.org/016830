Lane detection is an essential part of the perception sub-architecture of any automated driving
(AD) or advanced driver assistance system (ADAS). When focusing on low-cost, large scale products
for automated driving, model-driven approaches for the detection of lane markings have proven
good performance. More recently, data-driven approaches have been proposed that target the drivable
area / freespace mainly in inner-city applications. Focus of these approaches is less on lane-based
driving due to the fact that the lane concept does not fully apply in unstructured, residential inner-city
environments. So-far the concept of drivable area is seldom used for highway and inter-urban applications
due to the specific requirements of these scenarios that require clear lane associations of all
traffic participants. We believe that lane-based, mapless driving in inter-urban and highway
scenarios is still not fully handled with sufficient robustness and availability. Especially
for challenging weather situations such as heavy rain, fog, low-standing sun, darkness or reflections
in puddles, the mapless detection of lane markings decreases significantly or completely fails.
We see potential in applying specifically designed data-driven freespace approaches in more lane-based
driving applications for highways and inter-urban use. Therefore, we propose to classify specifically
a drivable corridor of the ego lane on pixel level with a deep learning approach. Our approach is kept
computationally efficient with only 0.66 million parameters allowing its application in large
scale products. Thus, we were able to easily integrate into an online AD system of a test vehicle.
We demonstrate the performance of our approach under challenging conditions qualitatively and
quantitatively in comparison to a state-of-the-art model-driven approach.

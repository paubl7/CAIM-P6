Today's businesses face a high pressure to innovate in order to succeed in highly competitive markets.
Successful innovations, though, typically require the identification and analysis of customer
needs. While traditional, established need elicitation methods are time-proven and have demonstrated
their capabilities to deliver valuable insights, they lack automation and scalability and, thus,
are expensive and time-consuming. In this article, we propose an approach to automatically identify
and quantify customer needs by utilizing a novel data source: Users voluntarily and publicly expose
information about themselves via social media, as for instance Facebook or Twitter. These posts
may contain valuable information about the needs, wants, and demands of their authors. We apply
a Design Science Research (DSR) methodology to add design knowledge and artifacts for the digitalization
of innovation processes, in particular to provide digital support for the elicitation of customer
needs. We want to investigate whether automated, speedy, and scalable need elicitation from social
media is feasible. We concentrate on Twitter as a data source and on e-mobility as an application
domain. In a first design cycle we conceive, implement and evaluate a method to demonstrate the feasibility
of identifying those social media posts that actually express customer needs. In a second cycle,
we build on this artifact to additionally quantify the need information elicited, and prove its
feasibility. Third, we integrate both developed methods into an end-user software artifact and
test usability in an industrial use case. Thus, we add new methods for need elicitation to the body
of knowledge, and introduce concrete tooling for innovation management in practice.

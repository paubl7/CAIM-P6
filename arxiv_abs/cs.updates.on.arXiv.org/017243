People park their vehicle depending on interior and exterior contexts. They do it naturally, even
unconsciously. For instance, with a baby seat on the rear, the driver might leave more space on one
side to be able to get the baby out easily; or when grocery shopping, s/he may position the vehicle
to remain the trunk accessible. Autonomous vehicles are becoming technically effective at driving
from A to B and parking in a proper spot, with a default way. However, in order to satisfy users' expectations
and to become trustworthy, they will also need to park or make a temporary stop, appropriate to the
given situation. In addition, users want to understand better the capabilities of their driving
assistance features, such as automated parking systems. A voice-based interface can help with
this and even ease the adoption of these features. Therefore, we developed a voice-based in-car
assistant (Park4U Mate), that is aware of interior and exterior contexts (thanks to a variety of
sensors), and that is able to park autonomously in a smart way (with a constraints minimization strategy).
The solution was demonstrated to thirty-five users in test-drives and their feedback was collected
on the system's decision-making capability as well as on the human-machine-interaction. The results
show that: (1) the proposed optimization algorithm is efficient at deciding the best parking strategy;
hence, autonomous vehicles can adopt it; (2) a voice-based digital assistant for autonomous parking
is perceived as a clear and effective interaction method. However, the interaction speed remained
the most important criterion for users. In addition, they clearly wish not to be limited on only voice-interaction,
to use the automated parking function and rather appreciate a multi-modal interaction.

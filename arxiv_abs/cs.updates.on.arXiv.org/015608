In this article, we developed and analyzed a thresholding method in which soft thresholding estimators
are independently expanded by empirical scaling values. The scaling values have a common hyper-parameter
that is an order of expansion of an ideal scaling value that achieves hard thresholding. We simply
call this estimator a scaled soft thresholding estimator. The scaled soft thresholding is a general
method that includes the soft thresholding and non-negative garrote as special cases and gives
an another derivation of adaptive LASSO. We then derived the degree of freedom of the scaled soft
thresholding by means of the Stein's unbiased risk estimate and found that it is decomposed into
the degree of freedom of soft thresholding and the reminder connecting to hard thresholding. In
this meaning, the scaled soft thresholding gives a natural bridge between soft and hard thresholding
methods. Since the degree of freedom represents the degree of over-fitting, this result implies
that there are two sources of over-fitting in the scaled soft thresholding. The first source originated
from soft thresholding is determined by the number of un-removed coefficients and is a natural measure
of the degree of over-fitting. We analyzed the second source in a particular case of the scaled soft
thresholding by referring a known result for hard thresholding. We then found that, in a sparse,
large sample and non-parametric setting, the second source is largely determined by coefficient
estimates whose true values are zeros and has an influence on over-fitting when threshold levels
are around noise levels in those coefficient estimates. In a simple numerical example, these theoretical
implications has well explained the behavior of the degree of freedom. Moreover, based on the results
here and some known facts, we explained the behaviors of risks of soft, hard and scaled soft thresholding
methods.

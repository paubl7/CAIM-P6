Momentum strategies are an important part of alternative investments and are at the heart of commodity
trading advisors (CTAs). These strategies have however been found to have difficulties adjusting
to rapid changes in market conditions, such as during the 2020 market crash. In particular, immediately
after momentum turning points, where a trend reverses from an uptrend (downtrend) to a downtrend
(uptrend), time-series momentum (TSMOM) strategies are prone to making bad bets. To improve the
response to regime change, we introduce a novel approach, where we insert an online change-point
detection (CPD) module into a Deep Momentum Network (DMN) [1904.04912] pipeline, which uses an
LSTM deep-learning architecture to simultaneously learn both trend estimation and position sizing.
Furthermore, our model is able to optimise the way in which it balances 1) a slow momentum strategy
which exploits persisting trends, but does not overreact to localised price moves, and 2) a fast
mean-reversion strategy regime by quickly flipping its position, then swapping it back again to
exploit localised price moves. Our CPD module outputs a changepoint location and severity score,
allowing our model to learn to respond to varying degrees of disequilibrium, or smaller and more
localised changepoints, in a data driven manner. Using a portfolio of 50, liquid, continuous futures
contracts over the period 1990-2020, the addition of the CPD module leads to an improvement in Sharpe
ratio of one-third. Even more notably, this module is especially beneficial in periods of significant
nonstationarity, and in particular, over the most recent years tested (2015-2020) the performance
boost is approximately two-thirds. This is especially interesting as traditional momentum strategies
have been underperforming in this period.

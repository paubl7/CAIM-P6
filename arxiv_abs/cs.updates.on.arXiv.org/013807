Efficient and accurate object detection in video and image analysis is one of the major beneficiaries
of the advancement in computer vision systems with the help of deep learning. With the aid of deep
learning, more powerful tools evolved, which are capable to learn high-level and deeper features
and thus can overcome the existing problems in traditional architectures of object detection algorithms.
The work in this thesis aims to achieve high accuracy in object detection with good real-time performance.
In the area of computer vision, a lot of research is going into the area of detection and processing
of visual information, by improving the existing algorithms. The binarized neural network has
shown high performance in various vision tasks such as image classification, object detection,
and semantic segmentation. The Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database
(MNIST), Canadian Institute for Advanced Research (CIFAR), and Street View House Numbers (SVHN)
datasets are used which is implemented using a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN)
that is 22 layers deep. Supervised learning is used in the work, which classifies the particular
dataset with the proper structure of the model. In still images, to improve accuracy, Googlenet
is used. The final layer of the Googlenet is replaced with the transfer learning to improve the accuracy
of the Googlenet. At the same time, the accuracy in moving images can be maintained by transfer learning
techniques. Hardware is the main backbone for any model to obtain faster results with a large number
of datasets. Here, Nvidia Jetson Nano is used which is a graphics processing unit (GPU), that can
handle a large number of computations in the process of object detection. Results show that the accuracy
of objects detected by the transfer learning method is more when compared to the existing methods.

While image registration has been studied in remote sensing community for decades, registering
multimodal data [e.g., optical, light detection and ranging (LiDAR), synthetic aperture radar
(SAR), and map] remains a challenging problem because of significant nonlinear intensity differences
between such data. To address this problem, this paper presents a fast and robust matching framework
integrating local descriptors for multimodal registration. In the proposed framework, a local
descriptor, such as Histogram of Oriented Gradient (HOG), Local Self Similarity (LSS), or Speeded-Up
Robust Feature (SURF), is first extracted at each pixel to form a pixel-wise feature representation
of an image. Then we define a similarity measure based on the feature representation in frequency
domain using the 3 Dimensional Fast Fourier Transform (3DFFT) technique, followed by a template
matching scheme to detect control points between images. In this procedure, we also propose a novel
pixel-wise feature representation using orientated gradients of images, which is named channel
features of orientated gradients (CFOG). This novel feature is an extension of the pixel-wise HOG
descriptors, and outperforms that both in matching performance and computational efficiency.
The major advantage of the proposed framework includes: (1) structural similarity representation
using the pixel-wise feature description and (2) high computational efficiency due to the use of
3DFFT. Experimental results on different types of multimodal images show the superior matching
performance of the proposed framework than the state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we design
an automatic registration system for very large-size multimodal images (more than 20000*20000
pixels) based on the proposed framework. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the designed
registration system.The matlab code is available in this manuscript.

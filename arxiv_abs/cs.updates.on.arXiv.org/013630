Spinal cord tumors lead to neurological morbidity and mortality. Being able to obtain morphometric
quantification (size, location, growth rate) of the tumor, edema, and cavity can result in improved
monitoring and treatment planning. Such quantification requires the segmentation of these structures
into three separate classes. However, manual segmentation of 3-dimensional structures is time-consuming
and tedious, motivating the development of automated methods. Here, we tailor a model adapted to
the spinal cord tumor segmentation task. Data were obtained from 343 patients using gadolinium-enhanced
T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI scans with cervical, thoracic, and/or lumbar coverage. The dataset
includes the three most common intramedullary spinal cord tumor types: astrocytomas, ependymomas,
and hemangioblastomas. The proposed approach is a cascaded architecture with U-Net-based models
that segments tumors in a two-stage process: locate and label. The model first finds the spinal cord
and generates bounding box coordinates. The images are cropped according to this output, leading
to a reduced field of view, which mitigates class imbalance. The tumor is then segmented. The segmentation
of the tumor, cavity, and edema (as a single class) reached 76.7 $\pm$ 1.5% of Dice score and the segmentation
of tumors alone reached 61.8 $\pm$ 4.0% Dice score. The true positive detection rate was above 87%
for tumor, edema, and cavity. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first fully automatic deep
learning model for spinal cord tumor segmentation. The multiclass segmentation pipeline is available
in the Spinal Cord Toolbox (https://spinalcordtoolbox.com/). It can be run with custom data on
a regular computer within seconds.

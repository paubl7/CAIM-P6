Cyber Physical Systems have been going into a transition phase from individual systems to a collecttives
of systems that collaborate in order to achieve a highly complex cause, realizing a system of systems
approach. The automotive domain has been making a transition to the system of system approach aiming
to provide a series of emergent functionality like traffic management, collaborative car fleet
management or large-scale automotive adaptation to physical environment thus providing significant
environmental benefits (e.g air pollution reduction) and achieving significant societal impact.
Similarly, large infrastructure domains, are evolving into global, highly integrated cyber-physical
systems of systems covering all parts of the value chain. In practice, there are significant challenges
in CPSoS applicability and usability to be addressed, i.e. even a small CPSoS such as a car consists
several subsystems Decentralization of CPSoS appoints tasks to individual CPSs within the System
of Systems. CPSoSs are heterogenous systems. They comprise of various, autonomous, CPSs, each
one of them having unique performance capabilities, criticality level, priorities and pursued
goals. all CPSs must also harmonically pursue system-based achievements and collaborate in order
to make system-of-system based decisions and implement the CPSoS functionality. This survey will
provide a comprehensive review on current best practices in connected cyberphysical systems.
The basis of our investigation is a dual layer architecture encompassing a perception layer and
a behavioral layer. Perception algorithms with respect to scene understanding (object detection
and tracking, pose estimation), localization mapping and path planning are thoroughly investigated.
Behavioural part focuses on decision making and human in the loop control.

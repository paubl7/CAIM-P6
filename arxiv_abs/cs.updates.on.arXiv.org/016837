Temperature monitoring during the life time of heat source components in engineering systems becomes
essential to ensure the normal work and even the long working life of these heat sources. However,
prior methods, which mainly use the interpolate estimation to reconstruct the whole temperature
field with the temperature value from limited monitoring points, require large amounts of temperature
tensors for an accurate estimation. This may decrease the availability and reliability of the system
and sharply increase the monitoring cost. Furthermore, limited number of labelled training samples
are available for the training of deep models. To solve this problem, this work develops a novel physics-informed
deep reversible regression models for temperature field reconstruction of heat-source systems
(TFR-HSS), which can better reconstruct the temperature field with the given limited monitoring
points unsupervisedly. First, we define the temperature field reconstruction task of heat-source
systems mathematically, numerically model the problem, and further transform the problem as an
image-to-image regression problem. Then, based on the law of forward and backward propagation
of deep models, this work develops the deep reversible regression model which can better learn the
physical information near the boundary and improve the reconstruction performance. Finally,
considering the physical characteristics of heat conduction as well as the boundary conditions,
this work proposes the physics-informed reconstruction loss including four training losses and
joint learns the deep surrogate model with these losses unsupervisedly. Experimental studies
have conducted over typical two-dimensional heat-source systems to demonstrate the effectiveness
and efficiency of the proposed physics-informed deep reversible regression models for TFR-HSS
task.

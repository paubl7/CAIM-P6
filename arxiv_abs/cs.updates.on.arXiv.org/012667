The Internet of Drones (IoD) gained momentum due to its high adaptability to a wide variety of complex
scenarios. Indeed, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can successfully be employed in different
applications, e.g., agriculture, search and rescue missions, surveillance systems, mission-critical
services, thanks to some technological and practical advantages: high mobility, capability to
extend wireless coverage areas. The employment of drones promisingly improves the performance
parameters of different network architectures, i.e., reliability, connectivity, throughput,
and delay, among others. Nevertheless, the adoption of networks of drones gives rise to several
issues related to the unreliability of the wireless medium, the duration of batteries, and the high
mobility degree, which may cause frequent topology changes. Also security and privacy issues need
to be properly investigated. This explains the number of works in the recent literature on IoD-related
topics. With respect to other surveys on these topics, this work aims at categorizing the multifaceted
aspects of IoD, proposing a classification approach of the IoD environment that develops along
two main directions. At a macroscopic level, it follows the structure of the Internet protocol stack,
starting from the physical layer and extending to the upper layers, without neglecting cross-layer
and optimization approaches. At a finer level, the relevant works belonging to each layer of the
stack are classified, according to the peculiar issues of the layer, and highlighting the most relevant
differences with the other surveys. Further, this work embraces privacy and security as well as
the potential economic impact of the IoD. Finally, a discussion on the research challenges and possible
future directions is carried out, focusing on the open issues and the promising technologies that
deserve to be further developed.

Foreseeing the brain evolution as a complex highly inter-connected system, widely modeled as a
graph, is crucial for mapping dynamic interactions between different anatomical regions of interest
(ROIs) in health and disease. Interestingly, brain graph evolution models remain almost absent
in the literature. Here we design an adversarial brain network normalizer for representing each
brain network as a transformation of a fixed centered population-driven connectional template.
Such graph normalization with respect to a fixed reference paves the way for reliably identifying
the most similar training samples (i.e., brain graphs) to the testing sample at baseline timepoint.
The testing evolution trajectory will be then spanned by the selected training graphs and their
corresponding evolution trajectories. We base our prediction framework on geometric deep learning
which naturally operates on graphs and nicely preserves their topological properties. Specifically,
we propose the first graph-based Generative Adversarial Network (gGAN) that not only learns how
to normalize brain graphs with respect to a fixed connectional brain template (CBT) (i.e., a brain
template that selectively captures the most common features across a brain population) but also
learns a high-order representation of the brain graphs also called embeddings. We use these embeddings
to compute the similarity between training and testing subjects which allows us to pick the closest
training subjects at baseline timepoint to predict the evolution of the testing brain graph over
time. A series of benchmarks against several comparison methods showed that our proposed method
achieved the lowest brain disease evolution prediction error using a single baseline timepoint.

In living systems, we often see the emergence of the ingredients necessary for computation -- the
capacity for information transmission, storage, and modification -- begging the question of how
we may exploit or imitate such biological systems in unconventional computing applications. What
can we gain from artificial life in the advancement of computing technology? Artificial life provides
us with powerful tools for understanding the dynamic behavior of biological systems and capturing
this behavior in manmade substrates. With this approach, we can move towards a new computing paradigm
concerned with harnessing emergent computation in physical substrates not governed by the constraints
of Moore's law and ultimately realize massively parallel and distributed computing technology.
In this paper, we argue that the lens of artificial life offers valuable perspectives for the advancement
of high-performance computing technology. We first present a brief foundational background on
artificial life and some relevant tools that may be applicable to unconventional computing. Two
specific substrates are then discussed in detail: biological neurons and ensembles of nanomagnets.
These substrates are the focus of the authors' ongoing work, and they are illustrative of the two
sides of the approach outlined here -- the close study of living systems and the construction of artificial
systems to produce life-like behaviors. We conclude with a philosophical discussion on what we
can learn from approaching computation with the curiosity inherent to the study of artificial life.
The main contribution of this paper is to present the great potential of using artificial life methodologies
to uncover and harness the inherent computational power of physical substrates toward applications
in unconventional high-performance computing.

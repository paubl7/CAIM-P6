The reliable and rapid identification of the COVID-19 has become crucial to prevent the rapid spread
of the disease, ease lockdown restrictions and reduce pressure on public health infrastructures.
Recently, several methods and techniques have been proposed to detect the SARS-CoV-2 virus using
different images and data. However, this is the first study that will explore the possibility of
using deep convolutional neural network (CNN) models to detect COVID-19 from electrocardiogram
(ECG) trace images. In this work, COVID-19 and other cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were detected
using deep-learning techniques. A public dataset of ECG images consists of 1937 images from five
distinct categories, such as Normal, COVID-19, myocardial infarction (MI), abnormal heartbeat
(AHB), and recovered myocardial infarction (RMI) were used in this study. Six different deep CNN
models (ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, InceptionV3, DenseNet201, and MobileNetv2) were used
to investigate three different classification schemes: two-class classification (Normal vs
COVID-19); three-class classification (Normal, COVID-19, and Other CVDs), and finally, five-class
classification (Normal, COVID-19, MI, AHB, and RMI). For two-class and three-class classification,
Densenet201 outperforms other networks with an accuracy of 99.1%, and 97.36%, respectively; while
for the five-class classification, InceptionV3 outperforms others with an accuracy of 97.83%.
ScoreCAM visualization confirms that the networks are learning from the relevant area of the trace
images. Since the proposed method uses ECG trace images which can be captured by smartphones and
are readily available facilities in low-resources countries, this study will help in faster computer-aided
diagnosis of COVID-19 and other cardiac abnormalities.

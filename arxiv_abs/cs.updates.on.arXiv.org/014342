The increase of generation capacity in the area of responsibility of the distribution system operator
(DSO) requires strengthening of coordination between transmission system operator (TSO) and
DSO in order to prevent conflicting or counteracting use of flexibility options. For this purpose,
methods for the standardized description and identification of the aggregated flexibility potential
of distribution grids (DGs) are developed. Approaches for identifying the feasible operation
region (FOR) of DGs can be categorized into two main classes: Data-driven/stochastic approaches
and optimization based approaches. While the latter have the advantage of working in real-world
scenarios where no full grid models exist, when relying on naive sampling strategies, they suffer
from poor coverage of the edges of the FOR. To underpin the need for improved sampling strategies
for data-driven approaches, in this paper we point out and analyse the shortcomings of naive sampling
strategies with focus on the problem of leptocurtic distribution of resulting interconnection
power flows (IPFs). We refer to this problem as convolution problem, as it can be traced back to the
fact that the probability density function (PDF) of the sum of two or more independent random variables
is the convolution of their respective PDFs. To demonstrate the convolution problem, we construct
a series of synthetic 0.4 kV feeders, which are characterized by an increasing number of nodes and
apply a sampling strategy to them that draws set-values for the controllable distributed energy
resources (DERs) from independent uniform distributions. By calculating the power flow for each
sample in each feeder, we end up with a collapsing IPF point cloud clearly indicating the convolution
problem.

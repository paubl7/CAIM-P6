Nowadays, the speed up development and use of digital devices such as smartphones have put people
at risk of internet crimes. The evidence of present crimes in a computer file can be easily unreachable
by changing the prefix of a file or other algorithms. In more complex cases, either file divided into
different parts or the parts of a file that has information about the file type are deleted, where
the file fragment recognition issue is discussed. The known files are divided into different fragments,
and different classification algorithms are used to solve the problems of file fragment recognition.
The issue of identifying the type of file fragment due to its importance in cybercrime issues as well
as antivirus has been highly emphasized and has been addressed in many articles. Increasing the
accuracy in this field on the types of widely used files due to the sensitivity of the subject of recognizing
the type of file under study is the main goal of researchers in this field. Failure to identify the
correct type of file will lead to deviations of the results and evidence from the main issue or failure
to conclude. In this paper, first, the file is divided into different fragments. Then, the file fragment
features, which are obtained from Binary Frequency Distribution, are reduced by 2 feature reduction
algorithms; Sequential Forward Selection algorithm as well as Sequential Floating Forward Selection
algorithm to delete sparse features that result in increased accuracy and speed. Finally, the reduced
features are given to 3 Multiclass classifier algorithms, Multilayer Perceptron, Support Vector
Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbor for classification and comparison of the results. The proposed
recognition algorithm can recognize 6 types of useful files and may distinguish a type of file fragments
with higher accuracy than the similar works done.

Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is a revolutionizing approach for achieving low-cost yet
spectral and energy efficient wireless communications. In this paper, we consider a wireless network
where multiple base stations (BSs) serve their respective users with the aid of distributed IRSs
in the downlink communication. Specifically, each IRS assists in the transmission from its associated
BS to user via passive beamforming, while in the meantime, it also randomly scatters the signals
from other co-channel BSs, thus resulting in additional signal as well as interference paths in
the network. As such, a new IRS-user/BS association problem arises pertaining to optimally balance
the passive beamforming gains from all IRSs among different BS-user communication links. To address
this new problem, we first derive the average signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR)
at the receiver of each user in closed-form, based on which two SINR balancing problems are formulated
to maximize the minimum SINR among all users by optimizing the IRS-user associations without and
with BS transmit power control, respectively. We also characterize the scaling behavior of user
SINRs with the increasing number of IRS reflecting elements to investigate the different effects
of IRS-reflected signal versus interference power. Moreover, to solve the two SINR balancing problems
that are both non-convex optimization problems, we propose an optimal solution to the problem with
BS power control and low-complexity suboptimal solutions to both problems by applying the branch-and-bound
method and exploiting new properties of the IRS-user associations, respectively. Numerical results
verify our performance analysis and also demonstrate significant performance gains of the proposed
solutions over benchmark schemes.

This work is part of an innovative e-learning project allowing the development of an advanced digital
educational tool that provides feedback during the process of learning handwriting for young school
children (three to eight years old). In this paper, we describe a new method for children handwriting
quality analysis. It automatically detects mistakes, gives real-time on-line feedback for children's
writing, and helps teachers comprehend and evaluate children's writing skills. The proposed method
adjudges five main criteria shape, direction, stroke order, position respect to the reference
lines, and kinematics of the trace. It analyzes the handwriting quality and automatically gives
feedback based on the combination of three extracted models: Beta-Elliptic Model (BEM) using similarity
detection (SD) and dissimilarity distance (DD) measure, Fourier Descriptor Model (FDM), and perceptive
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with Support Vector Machine (SVM) comparison engine. The originality
of our work lies partly in the system architecture which apprehends complementary dynamic, geometric,
and visual representation of the examined handwritten scripts and in the efficient selected features
adapted to various handwriting styles and multiple script languages such as Arabic, Latin, digits,
and symbol drawing. The application offers two interactive interfaces respectively dedicated
to learners, educators, experts or teachers and allows them to adapt it easily to the specificity
of their disciples. The evaluation of our framework is enhanced by a database collected in Tunisia
primary school with 400 children. Experimental results show the efficiency and robustness of our
suggested framework that helps teachers and children by offering positive feedback throughout
the handwriting learning process using tactile digital devices.

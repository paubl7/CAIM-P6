Data Analytics provides core business reporting needs in many software companies, acts as a source
of truth for key information, and enables building advanced solutions, e.g., predictive models,
machine learning, real-time recommendations, to grow the business. A self-service, multi-tenant,
API-first, and scalable data platform is the foundational requirement in creating an enterprise
data marketplace, which enables the creation, publishing, and exchange of data products. Such
a marketplace enables the exploration and discovery of data products, further providing high-level
data governance and oversight on marketplace contents. In this paper, we describe our way to the
gourmet data product marketplace. We cover the design principles, the implementation details,
technology choices, and the journey to build an enterprise data platform that meets the above characteristics.
The platform consists of ingestion, streaming, storage, transformation, schema generation,
fail-safe, data sharing, access management, PII data automatic identification, self-service
storage optimization recommendations, and CI/CD integration. We then show how the platform enables
and operates the data marketplace, facilitating the exchange of stable data products across users
and tenants. We motivate and show how we run scalable decentralized data governance. All of this
is built and run for Cimpress Technology (CT), which operates the Mass Customization Platform for
Cimpress and its businesses. The CT data platform serves 1000s of users from different platform
participants, with data sourced from heterogeneous sources. Data is ingested at a rate of well over
1000 individual messages per second and serves more than 100k analytical queries daily.

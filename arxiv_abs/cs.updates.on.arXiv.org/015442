The Internet of Drones (IoD) recently gained momentum due to its high adaptability to a wide variety
of complex scenarios. Indeed, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) can successfully be employed in
different applications, thanks to some technological and practical advantages: high mobility,
capability to extend wireless coverage areas, or ability to reach places inaccessible to humans.
Moreover, the employment of drones promisingly improves the performance parameters of different
network architectures. Nevertheless, the adoption of networks of drones gives rise to several
issues related to the unreliability of the wireless medium, the duration of batteries, and the high
mobility degree, which may cause frequent topology changes. Also security and privacy issues need
to be properly investigated. With respect to other surveys on IoD-related topics, the goal of the
present work is to categorize the multifaceted aspects of IoD, proposing a classification approach
of the IoD environment that develops along two main directions. At a macroscopic level, it follows
the structure of the Internet protocol stack, starting from the physical layer and extending to
the upper layers, without neglecting cross-layer and optimization approaches. At a finer level,
all the most relevant works belonging to each layer of the stack are further classified, according
to the different issues peculiar of the layer, and highlighting the most relevant differences with
the other surveys present in literature. To provide a deeper insight in the theme, the present work
embraces many facets of the IoD, including privacy and security considerations as well as the potential
economic impact of the IoD. Finally, a discussion on the main research challenges and possible future
directions is carried out, focusing on the open issues and the most promising technologies that
deserve to be further developed in the IoD field.

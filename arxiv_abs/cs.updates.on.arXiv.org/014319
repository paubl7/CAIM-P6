Background. Many mutation reduction strategies, which aim to reduce the number of mutants, have
been proposed. Problem. It is important to measure the ability of a mutation reduction strategy
to maintain test suite effectiveness evaluation. However, existing evaluation indicators are
unable to measure the "order-preserving ability". Objective. We aim to propose evaluation indicators
to measure the "order-preserving ability" of a mutation reduction strategy, which is important
but missing in our community. Method. Given a test suite on a Software Under Test (SUT) with a set of
original mutants, we leverage the test suite to generate a group of test suites that have a partial
order relationship in fault detecting potential. When evaluating a reduction strategy, we first
construct two partial order relationships among the generated test suites in terms of mutation
score, one with the original mutants and another with the reduced mutants. Then, we measure the extent
to which the two partial order relationships are consistent. The more consistent the two partial
order relationships are, the stronger the Order Preservation (OP) of the mutation reduction strategy
is, and the more effective the reduction strategy is. Furthermore, we propose Effort-aware Relative
Order Preservation (EROP) to measure how much gain a mutation reduction strategy can provide compared
with a random reduction strategy. Result. The experimental results show that OP and EROP are able
to efficiently measure the "order-preserving ability" of a mutation reduction strategy. As a result,
they have a better ability to distinguish various mutation reduction strategies compared with
the existing evaluation indicators. Conclusion. We suggest, for the researchers, that OP and EROP
should be used to measure the effectiveness of a mutant reduction strategy.

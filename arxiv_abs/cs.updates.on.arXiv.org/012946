Repositioning of recording electrode array across repeated electromyography measurements may
result in a displacement error in hand movement classification systems. In order to examine if the
classifier re-training could reach satisfactory results when electrode array is translated along
or rotated around subject's forearm for varying number of features, we recorded surface electromyography
signals in 10 healthy volunteers for three types of grasp and 6 wrist movements. For feature extraction
we applied principal component analysis and the feature set size varied from one to 8 principal components.
We compared results of re-trained classifier with results from leave-one-out cross-validation
classification procedure for three classifiers: LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis), QDA (Quadratic
Discriminant Analysis), and ANN (Artificial Neural Network). Our results showed that there was
no significant difference in classification accuracy when the array electrode was repositioned
indicating successful classification re-training and optimal feature set selection. The results
also indicate expectedly that the number of principal components plays a key role for acceptable
classification accuracy ~90 %. For the largest dataset (9 hand movements), LDA and QDA outperformed
ANN, while for three grasping movements ANN showed promising results. Interestingly, we showed
that interaction between electrode array position and the feature set size is not statistically
significant. This study emphasizes the importance of testing the interaction of factors that influence
classification accuracy and classifier selection altogether with their impact independently
in order to establish guiding principles for design of hand movement recognition system. Data recorded
for this study are stored on Zenodo repository (doi: 10.5281/zenodo.4039550).

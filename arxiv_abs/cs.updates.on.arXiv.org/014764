Jupyter notebooks has emerged as a standard tool for data science programming. Programs in Jupyter
notebooks are different from typical programs as they are constructed by a collection of code snippets
interleaved with text and visualisation. This allows interactive exploration and snippets may
be executed in different order which may give rise to different results due to side-effects between
snippets. Previous studies have shown the presence of considerable code duplication -- code clones
-- in sources of traditional programs, in both so-called systems programming languages and so-called
scripting languages. In this paper we present the first large-scale study of code cloning in Jupyter
notebooks. We analyse a corpus of 2.7 million Jupyter notebooks hosted on GitHJub, representing
37 million individual snippets and 227 million lines of code. We study clones at the level of individual
snippets, and study the extent to which snippets are recurring across multiple notebooks. We study
both identical clones and approximate clones and conduct a small-scale ocular inspection of the
most common clones. We find that code cloning is common in Jupyter notebooks -- more than 70% of all
code snippets are exact copies of other snippets (with possible differences in white spaces), and
around 50% of all notebooks do not have any unique snippet, but consists solely of snippets that are
also found elsewhere. In notebooks written in Python, at least 80% of all snippets are approximate
clones and the prevalence of code cloning is higher in Python than in other languages. We further
find that clones between different repositories are far more common than clones within the same
repository. However, the most common individual repository from which a Jupyter notebook contains
clones is the repository in which itself resides.

This review presents and reviews various solved and open problems in developing, analyzing, and
mitigating epidemic spreading processes under human decision-making. We provide a review of a
range of epidemic models and explain the pros and cons of different epidemic models. We exhibit the
art of coupling epidemic models and decision models in the existing literature. More specifically,
fundamental questions in human decision-making amid epidemics such as what interventions are
taken to combat the disease, who are decision-makers, when interventions are taken, and how interventions
are modeled. Among many decision models, game-theoretic models have become increasingly crucial
in modeling human responses/behavior amid epidemics in the last decade. In this review, we motivate
the game-theoretic approach to human decision-making amid epidemics. This review provides an
overview of the existing literature by developing a multi-dimensional taxonomy, which categorizes
existing works based on multiple dimensions, including 1) types of games, such as differential
games, stochastic games, evolutionary games, and static games; 2) types of interventions, such
as social distancing, vaccination, quarantine, taking antidotes, etc.; 3) the types of decision-makers,
such as individuals, adversaries, and central authorities at different hierarchical levels.
A fine-grained dynamic game framework is proposed to capture the essence of game-theoretic decision-making
amid epidemics. From a vast body of works, we showcase three representative works with unique ways
of integrating game-theoretic decision-making into the epidemic models. The uniqueness of each
of these three works distinguishes themselves from each other regarding their models, analytical
approaches, and results. In the end, we identify several main open problems and research gaps left
to be addressed and filled.

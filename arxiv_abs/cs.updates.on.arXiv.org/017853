Recently, learning-based algorithms have shown impressive performance in underwater image enhancement.
Most of them resort to training on synthetic data and achieve outstanding performance. However,
these methods ignore the significant domain gap between the synthetic and real data (i.e., interdomain
gap), and thus the models trained on synthetic data often fail to generalize well to real underwater
scenarios. Furthermore, the complex and changeable underwater environment also causes a great
distribution gap among the real data itself (i.e., intra-domain gap). However, almost no research
focuses on this problem and thus their techniques often produce visually unpleasing artifacts
and color distortions on various real images. Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel
Two-phase Underwater Domain Adaptation network (TUDA) to simultaneously minimize the inter-domain
and intra-domain gap. Concretely, a new dual-alignment network is designed in the first phase,
including a translation part for enhancing realism of input images, followed by an enhancement
part. With performing image-level and feature-level adaptation in two parts by jointly adversarial
learning, the network can better build invariance across domains and thus bridge the inter-domain
gap. In the second phase, we perform an easy-hard classification of real data according to the assessed
quality of enhanced images, where a rank-based underwater quality assessment method is embedded.
By leveraging implicit quality information learned from rankings, this method can more accurately
assess the perceptual quality of enhanced images. Using pseudo labels from the easy part, an easy-hard
adaptation technique is then conducted to effectively decrease the intra-domain gap between easy
and hard samples.

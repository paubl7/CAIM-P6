The creation and the manipulation of facial appearance via deep generative approaches, known as
DeepFake, have achieved significant progress and promoted a wide range of benign and malicious
applications. The evil side of this new technique poses another popular study, i.e., DeepFake detection
aiming to identify the fake faces from the real ones. With the rapid development of the DeepFake-related
studies in the community, both sides (i.e., DeepFake generation and detection) have formed the
relationship of the battleground, pushing the improvements of each other and inspiring new directions,
e.g., the evasion of DeepFake detection. Nevertheless, the overview of such battleground and the
new direction is unclear and neglected by recent surveys due to the rapid increase of related publications,
limiting the in-depth understanding of the tendency and future works. To fill this gap, in this paper,
we provide a comprehensive overview and detailed analysis of the research work on the topic of DeepFake
generation, DeepFake detection as well as evasion of DeepFake detection, with more than 191 research
papers carefully surveyed. We present the taxonomy of various DeepFake generation methods and
the categorization of various DeepFake detection methods, and more importantly, we showcase the
battleground between the two parties with detailed interactions between the adversaries (DeepFake
generation) and the defenders (DeepFake detection). The battleground allows fresh perspective
into the latest landscape of the DeepFake research and can provide valuable analysis towards the
research challenges and opportunities as well as research trends and directions in the field of
DeepFake generation and detection. We also elaborately design interactive diagrams (this http

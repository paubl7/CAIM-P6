We extend the theory of PAC learning in a way which allows to model a rich variety of learning tasks
where the data satisfy special properties that ease the learning process. For example, tasks where
the distance of the data from the decision boundary is bounded away from zero. The basic and simple
idea is to consider partial concepts: these are functions that can be undefined on certain parts
of the space. When learning a partial concept, we assume that the source distribution is supported
only on points where the partial concept is defined. This way, one can naturally express assumptions
on the data such as lying on a lower dimensional surface or margin conditions. In contrast, it is not
at all clear that such assumptions can be expressed by the traditional PAC theory. In fact we exhibit
easy-to-learn partial concept classes which provably cannot be captured by the traditional PAC
theory. This also resolves a question posed by Attias, Kontorovich, and Mansour 2019. We characterize
PAC learnability of partial concept classes and reveal an algorithmic landscape which is fundamentally
different than the classical one. For example, in the classical PAC model, learning boils down to
Empirical Risk Minimization (ERM). In stark contrast, we show that the ERM principle fails in explaining
learnability of partial concept classes. In fact, we demonstrate classes that are incredibly easy
to learn, but such that any algorithm that learns them must use an hypothesis space with unbounded
VC dimension. We also find that the sample compression conjecture fails in this setting. Thus, this
theory features problems that cannot be represented nor solved in the traditional way. We view this
as evidence that it might provide insights on the nature of learnability in realistic scenarios
which the classical theory fails to explain.

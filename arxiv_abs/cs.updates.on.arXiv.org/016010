Open pit mines left many regions worldwide inhospitable or uninhabitable. To put these regions
back into use, entire stretches of land must be renaturalized. For the sustainable subsequent use
or transfer to a new primary use, many contaminated sites and soil information have to be permanently
managed. In most cases, this information is available in the form of expert reports in unstructured
data collections or file folders, which in the best case are digitized. Due to size and complexity
of the data, it is difficult for a single person to have an overview of this data in order to be able to
make reliable statements. This is one of the most important obstacles to the rapid transfer of these
areas to after-use. An information-based approach to this issue supports fulfilling several Sustainable
Development Goals regarding environment issues, health and climate action. We use a stack of Optical
Character Recognition, Text Classification, Active Learning and Geographic Information System
Visualization to effectively mine and visualize this information. Subsequently, we link the extracted
information to geographic coordinates and visualize them using a Geographic Information System.
Active Learning plays a vital role because our dataset provides no training data. In total, we process
nine categories and actively learn their representation in our dataset. We evaluate the OCR, Active
Learning and Text Classification separately to report the performance of the system. Active Learning
and text classification results are twofold: Whereas our categories about restrictions work sufficient
($>$.85 F1), the seven topic-oriented categories were complicated for human coders and hence the
results achieved mediocre evaluation scores ($<$.70 F1).

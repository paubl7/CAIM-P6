Purpose: To use and test a labelling algorithm that operates on two-dimensional (2D) reformations,
rather than three-dimensional (3D) data to locate and identify vertebrae. Methods: We improved
the Btrfly Net (described by Sekuboyina et al) that works on sagittal and coronal maximum intensity
projections (MIP) and augmented it with two additional components: spine-localization and adversarial
a priori-learning. Furthermore, we explored two variants of adversarial training schemes that
incorporated the anatomical a priori knowledge into the Btrfly Net. We investigated the superiority
of the proposed approach for labelling vertebrae on three datasets: a public benchmarking dataset
of 302 CT scans and two in-house datasets with a total of 238 CT scans. We employed Wilcoxon signed-rank
test to compute the statistical significance of the improvement in performance observed due to
various architectural components in our approach. Results: On the public dataset, our approach
using the described Btrfly(pe-eb) network performed on par with current state-of-the-art methods
achieving a statistically significant (p < .001) vertebrae identification rate of 88.5+/-0.2
% and localization distances of less than 7-mm. On the in-house datasets that had a higher inter-scan
data variability, we obtained an identification rate of 85.1+/-1.2%. Conclusion: An identification
performance comparable to existing 3D approaches was achieved when labelling vertebrae on 2D MIPs.
The performance was further improved using the proposed adversarial training regime that effectively
enforced local spine a priori knowledge during training. Lastly, spine-localization increased
the generalizability of our approach by homogenizing the content in the MIPs.

The last decade consolidated the cyberspace as fifth domain of operations, which extends its preliminarily
intelligence and information exchange purposes towards enabling complex offensive and defensive
operations supported/supportively of parallel kinetic domain actuations. Although there is
a plethora of well documented cases on strategic and operational interventions of cyber commands,
the cyber tactical military edge is still a challenge, where cyber fires barely integrate to the
traditional joint targeting cycle due among others to long planning/development times, asymmetric
effects, strict target reachability requirements, or the fast propagation of collateral damage;
the latter rapidly deriving on hybrid impacts (political, economic, social, etc.) and evidencing
significant socio-technical gaps. In this context, it is expected that tactical clouds disruptively
facilitate cyber operations at the edge while exposing the rest of the digital assets of the operation
to them. On these grounds, the main purpose of the conducted research is to review and in depth analyze
the risks and opportunities of jeopardizing the sustainability of the military tactical clouds
at the edge by cyber operations. Along with a 1) comprehensively formulation of the researched problematic,
the study 2) formalizes the Tactical Denial of Sustainability (TDoS) concept; 3) introduces the
phasing, potential attack surfaces, terrains and impact of TDoS attacks; 4) emphasizes the related
human and socio-technical aspects; 5) analyzes the threats/opportunities inherent to their impact
on the cloud energy efficiency; 6) reviews their implications at the military cyber thinking for
tactical operations; 7) illustrates five extensive CONOPS that facilitate the understanding
of the TDoS concept; and given the high novelty of the discussed topics, it 8) paves the way for further
research and development actions.

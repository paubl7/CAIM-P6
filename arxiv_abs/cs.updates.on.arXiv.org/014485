Automatic segmentation of medical images with DL algorithms has proven to be highly successful.
With most of these algorithms, inter-observer variation is an acknowledged problem, leading to
sub-optimal results. This problem is even more significant in post-operative clinical target
volume (post-op CTV) segmentation due to the absence of macroscopic visual tumor in the image. This
study, using post-op CTV segmentation as the test bed, tries to determine if physician styles are
consistent and learnable, if there is an impact of physician styles on treatment outcome and toxicity;
and how to explicitly deal with physician styles in DL algorithms to facilitate its clinical acceptance.
A classifier is trained to identify which physician has contoured the CTV from just the contour and
corresponding CT scan, to determine if physician styles are consistent and learnable. Next, we
evaluate if adapting automatic segmentation to physician styles would be clinically feasible
based on a lack of difference between outcomes. For modeling different physician styles of CTV segmentation,
a concept called physician style-aware (PSA) segmentation is proposed which is an encoder-multidecoder
network trained with perceptual loss. With the proposed physician style-aware network (PSA-Net),
Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) accuracy increases on an average of 3.4% for all physicians from
a general model that is not style adapted. We show that stylistic contouring variations also exist
between institutions that follow the same segmentation guidelines and show the effectiveness
of the proposed method in adapting to new institutional styles. We observed an accuracy improvement
of 5% in terms of DSC when adapting to the style of a separate institution.

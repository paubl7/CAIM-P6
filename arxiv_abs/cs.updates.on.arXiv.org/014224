Innovative solutions addressing product anti-counterfeiting and record provenance have been
deployed across today's internationally spanning supply chain networks. These product anti-counterfeiting
solutions are developed and implemented with centralized system architecture relying on centralized
authorities or any form of intermediaries. Vulnerabilities of centralized product anti-counterfeiting
solutions could possibly lead to system failure or susceptibility of malicious modifications
performed on product records or various potential attacks to the system components by dishonest
participant nodes traversing along the supply chain. Blockchain technology has progressed from
merely with a use case of immutable ledger for cryptocurrency transactions to a programmable interactive
environment of developing decentralized and reliable applications addressing different use
cases globally. In this research, so as to facilitate trustworthy data provenance retrieval, verification
and management, as well as strengthening capability of product anti-counterfeiting, key areas
of decentralization and feasible mechanisms of developing decentralized and distributed product
anti-counterfeiting and traceability ecosystems utilizing blockchain technology, are identified
via a series of security and threat analyses performed mainly against NFC-Enabled Anti-Counterfeiting
System (NAS) which is one of the solutions currently implemented in the industry with centralized
architecture. A set of fundamental system requirements are set out for developing a blockchain-enabled
autonomous and decentralized solution for supply chain anti-counterfeiting and traceability,
as a secure and immutable scientific data provenance tracking and management platform in which
provenance records, providing compelling properties on data integrity of luxurious goods, are
recorded and verified automatically, for supply chain industry.

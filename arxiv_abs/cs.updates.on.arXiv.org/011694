Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) are being increasingly deployed for commercial, civilian, and military
applications. The current UAS state-of-the-art still depends on a remote human controller with
robust wireless links to perform several of these applications. The lack of autonomy restricts
the domains of application and tasks for which a UAS can be deployed. Enabling autonomy and intelligence
to the UAS will help overcome this hurdle and expand its use improving safety and efficiency. The
exponential increase in computing resources and the availability of large amount of data in this
digital era has led to the resurgence of machine learning from its last winter. Therefore, in this
chapter, we discuss how some of the advances in machine learning, specifically deep learning and
reinforcement learning can be leveraged to develop next-generation autonomous UAS. We first begin
motivating this chapter by discussing the application, challenges, and opportunities of the current
UAS in the introductory section. We then provide an overview of some of the key deep learning and reinforcement
learning techniques discussed throughout this chapter. A key area of focus that will be essential
to enable autonomy to UAS is computer vision. Accordingly, we discuss how deep learning approaches
have been used to accomplish some of the basic tasks that contribute to providing UAS autonomy. Then
we discuss how reinforcement learning is explored for using this information to provide autonomous
control and navigation for UAS. Next, we provide the reader with directions to choose appropriate
simulation suites and hardware platforms that will help to rapidly prototype novel machine learning
based solutions for UAS. We additionally discuss the open problems and challenges pertaining to
each aspect of developing autonomous UAS solutions to shine light on potential research areas.

This article explores citing and referencing systems in Social Sciences and Medicine articles
from different theoretical and practical perspectives, considering bibliographic references
as a facet of descriptive representation. The analysis of citing and referencing elements (i.e.
bibliographic references, mentions, quotations, and respective in-text reference pointers)
identified citing and referencing habits within disciplines under consideration and errors occurring
over the long term as stated by previous studies now expanded. Future expected trends of information
retrieval from bibliographic metadata was gathered by approaching these referencing elements
from the FRBR Entities concepts. Reference styles do not fully accomplish with their role of guiding
authors and publishers on providing concise and well-structured bibliographic metadata within
bibliographic references. Trends on representative description revision suggest a predicted
distancing on the ways information is approached by bibliographic references and bibliographic
catalogs adopting FRBR concepts, including the description levels adopted by each of them under
the perspective of the FRBR Entities concept. This study was based on a subset of Medicine and Social
Sciences articles published in 2019 and, therefore, it may not be taken as a final and broad coverage.
Future studies expanding these approaches to other disciplines and chronological periods are
encouraged. By approaching citing and referencing issues as descriptive representation's facets,
findings on this study may encourage further studies that will support Information Science and
Computer Science on providing tools to become bibliographic metadata description simpler, better
structured and more efficient facing the revision of descriptive representation actually in progress.

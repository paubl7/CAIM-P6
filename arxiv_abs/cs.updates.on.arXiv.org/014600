Mental health problems impact quality of life of millions of people around the world. However, diagnosis
of mental health disorders is a challenging problem that often relies on self-reporting by patients
about their behavioral patterns. Therefore, there is a need for new strategies for diagnosis of
mental health problems. The recent introduction of body-area networks consisting of a plethora
of accurate sensors embedded in smartwatches and smartphones and deep neural networks (DNNs) points
towards a possible solution. However, disease diagnosis based on WMSs and DNNs, and their deployment
on edge devices, remains a challenging problem. To this end, we propose a framework called MHDeep
that utilizes commercially available WMSs and efficient DNN models to diagnose three important
mental health disorders: schizoaffective, major depressive, and bipolar. MHDeep uses eight different
categories of data obtained from sensors integrated in a smartwatch and smartphone. Due to limited
available data, MHDeep uses a synthetic data generation module to augment real data with synthetic
data drawn from the same probability distribution. We use the synthetic dataset to pre-train the
DNN models, thus imposing a prior on the weights. We use a grow-and-prune DNN synthesis approach
to learn both the architecture and weights during the training process. We use three different data
partitions to evaluate the MHDeep models trained with data collected from 74 individuals. We conduct
data instance level and patient level evaluations. MHDeep achieves an average test accuracy of
90.4%, 87.3%, and 82.4%, respectively, for classifications between healthy instances and schizoaffective
disorder instances, major depressive disorder instances, and bipolar disorder instances. At
the patient level, MHDeep DNNs achieve an accuracy of 100%, 100%, and 90.0% for the three mental health
disorders, respectively.

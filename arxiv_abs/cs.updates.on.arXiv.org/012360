This paper presents a formal verification guided approach for a principled design and implementation
of robust and resilient learning-enabled systems. We focus on learning-enabled state estimation
systems (LE-SESs), which have been widely used in robotics applications to determine the current
state (e.g., location, speed, direction, etc.) of a complex system. The LE-SESs are networked systems
composed of a set of connected components including Bayes filters for localisation, and neural
networks for processing sensory input. We study LE-SESs from the perspective of formal verification,
which determines the satisfiability of a system model against the specified properties. Over LE-SESs,
we investigate two key properties - robustness and resilience - and provide their formal definitions.
To enable formal verification, we reduce the LE-SESs to a novel class of labelled transition systems,
named {PO}2-LTS in the paper, and formally express the properties as constrained optimisation
objectives. We prove that the robustness verification is NP-complete. Based on {PO}2-LTS and the
optimisation objectives, practical verification algorithms are developed to check the satisfiability
of the properties on the LE-SESs. As a major case study, we interrogate a real-world dynamic tracking
system which uses a single Kalman Filter (KF) - a special case of Bayes filter - to localise and track
a ground vehicle. Its perception system, based on convolutional neural networks, processes a high-resolution
Wide Area Motion Imagery (WAMI) data stream. Experimental results show that our algorithms can
not only verify the properties of the WAMI tracking system but also provide representative examples,
the latter of which inspired us to take an enhanced LE-SESs design where runtime monitors or joint-KFs
are required. Experimental results confirm the improvement of the robustness of the enhanced design.

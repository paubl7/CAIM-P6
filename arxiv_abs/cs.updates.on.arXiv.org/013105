A conceptual system with rich connotation is key to improving the performance of knowledge-based
artificial intelligence systems. While a conceptual system, which has abundant concepts and rich
semantic relationships, and is developable, evolvable, and adaptable to multi-task environments,
its actual construction is not only one of the major challenges of knowledge engineering, but also
the fundamental goal of research on knowledge and conceptualization. Finding a new method to represent
concepts and construct a conceptual system will therefore greatly improve the performance of many
intelligent systems. Fortunately the core of human cognition is a system with relatively complete
concepts and a mechanism that ensures the establishment and development of the system. The human
conceptual system can not be achieved immediately, but rather must develop gradually. Developmental
psychology carefully observes the process of concept acquisition in humans at the behavioral level,
and along with cognitive psychology has proposed some rough explanations of those observations.
However, due to the lack of research in aspects such as representation, systematic models, algorithm
details and realization, many of the results of developmental psychology have not been applied
directly to the building of artificial conceptual systems. For example, Karmiloff-Smith's Representation
Redescription (RR) supposition reflects a concept-acquisition process that re-describes a lower
level representation of a concept to a higher one. This paper is inspired by this developmental psychology
viewpoint. We use an object-oriented approach to re-explain and materialize RR supposition from
the formal semantic perspective, because the OO paradigm is a natural way to describe the outside
world, and it also has strict grammar regulations.

Face masks have long been used in many areas of everyday life to protect against the inhalation of
hazardous fumes and particles. They also offer an effective solution in healthcare for bi-directional
protection against air-borne diseases. Wearing and positioning the mask correctly is essential
for its function. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) offer an excellent solution for face recognition
and classification of correct mask wearing and positioning. In the context of the ongoing COVID-19
pandemic, such algorithms can be used at entrances to corporate buildings, airports, shopping
areas, and other indoor locations, to mitigate the spread of the virus. These application scenarios
impose major challenges to the underlying compute platform. The inference hardware must be cheap,
small and energy efficient, while providing sufficient memory and compute power to execute accurate
CNNs at a reasonably low latency. To maintain data privacy of the public, all processing must remain
on the edge-device, without any communication with cloud servers. To address these challenges,
we present a low-power binary neural network classifier for correct facial-mask wear and positioning.
The classification task is implemented on an embedded FPGA, performing high-throughput binary
operations. Classification can take place at up to ~6400 frames-per-second, easily enabling multi-camera,
speed-gate settings or statistics collection in crowd settings. When deployed on a single entrance
or gate, the idle power consumption is reduced to 1.6W, improving the battery-life of the device.
We achieve an accuracy of up to 98% for four wearing positions of the MaskedFace-Net dataset. To maintain
equivalent classification accuracy for all face structures, skin-tones, hair types, and mask
types, the algorithms are tested for their ability to generalize the relevant features over all
subjects using the Grad-CAM approach.

Memory disaggregation provides efficient memory utilization across network-connected systems.
It allows a node to use part of memory in remote nodes in the same cluster. Recent studies have improved
RDMA-based memory disaggregation systems, supporting lower latency and higher bandwidth than
the prior generation of disaggregated memory. However, the current disaggregated memory systems
manage remote memory only at coarse granularity due to the limitation of the access validation mechanism
of RDMA. In such systems, to support fine-grained remote page allocation, the trustworthiness
of all participating systems needs to be assumed, and thus a security breach in a node can propagate
to the entire cluster. From the security perspective, the memory-providing node must protect its
memory from memory-requesting nodes. On the other hand, the memory-requesting node requires the
confidentiality and integrity protection of its memory contents even if they are stored in remote
nodes. To address the weak isolation support in the current system, this study proposes a novel hardware-assisted
memory disaggregation system. Based on the security features of FPGA, the logic in each per-node
FPGA board provides a secure memory disaggregation engine. With its own networks, a set of FPGA-based
engines form a trusted memory disaggregation system, which is isolated from the privileged software
of each participating node. The secure memory disaggregation system allows fine-grained memory
management in memory-providing nodes, while the access validation is guaranteed with the hardware-hardened
mechanism. In addition, the proposed system hides the memory access patterns observable from remote
nodes, supporting obliviousness. Our evaluation with FPGA implementation shows that such fine-grained
secure disaggregated memory is feasible with comparable performance to the latest software-based
techniques.

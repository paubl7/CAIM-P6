Federated Edge Learning (FEEL) involves the collaborative training of machine learning models
among edge devices, with the orchestration of a server in a wireless edge network. Due to frequent
model updates, FEEL needs to be adapted to the limited communication bandwidth, scarce energy of
edge devices, and the statistical heterogeneity of edge devices' data distributions. Therefore,
a careful scheduling of a subset of devices for training and uploading models is necessary. In contrast
to previous work in FEEL where the data aspects are under-explored, we consider data properties
at the heart of the proposed scheduling algorithm. To this end, we propose a new scheduling scheme
for non-independent and-identically-distributed (non-IID) and unbalanced datasets in FEEL.
As the data is the key component of the learning, we propose a new set of considerations for data characteristics
in wireless scheduling algorithms in FEEL. In fact, the data collected by the devices depends on
the local environment and usage pattern. Thus, the datasets vary in size and distributions among
the devices. In the proposed algorithm, we consider both data and resource perspectives. In addition
to minimizing the completion time of FEEL as well as the transmission energy of the participating
devices, the algorithm prioritizes devices with rich and diverse datasets. We first define a general
framework for the data-aware scheduling and the main axes and requirements for diversity evaluation.
Then, we discuss diversity aspects and some exploitable techniques and metrics. Next, we formulate
the problem and present our FEEL scheduling algorithm. Evaluations in different scenarios show
that our proposed FEEL scheduling algorithm can help achieve high accuracy in few rounds with a reduced
cost.

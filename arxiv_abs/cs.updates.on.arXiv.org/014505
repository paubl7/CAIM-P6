Cardinality estimation is perhaps the simplest non-trivial statistical problem that can be solved
via sketching. Industrially-deployed sketches like HyperLogLog, MinHash, and PCSA are mergeable,
which means that large data sets can be sketched in a distributed environment, and then merged into
a single sketch of the whole data set. In the last decade a variety of sketches have been developed
that are non-mergeable, but attractive for other reasons. They are simpler, their cardinality
estimates are strictly unbiased, and they have substantially lower variance. We evaluate sketching
schemes on a reasonably level playing field, in terms of their memory-variance product (MVP). E.g.,
a sketch that occupies $5m$ bits and whose relative variance is $2/m$ (standard error $\sqrt{2/m}$)
has an MVP of $10$. Our contributions are as follows. Cohen and Ting independently discovered what
we call the Martingale transform for converting a mergeable sketch into a non-mergeable sketch.
We present a simpler way to analyze the limiting MVP of Martingale-type sketches. We prove that the
\Martingale{} transform is optimal in the non-mergeable world, and that \Martingale{} \fishmonger{}
in particular is optimal among linearizable sketches, with an MVP of $H_0/2 \approx 1.63$. E.g.,
this is circumstantial evidence that to achieve 1\% standard error, we cannot do better than a 2 kilobyte
sketch. \Martingale{} \fishmonger{} is neither simple nor practical. We develop a new mergeable
sketch called \Curtain{} that strikes a nice balance between simplicity and efficiency, and prove
that \Martingale{} \Curtain{} has limiting $\MVP\approx 2.31$. It can be updated with $O(1)$ memory
accesses and it has lower empirical variance than \Martingale{} \LogLog, a practical non-mergeable
version of HyperLogLog.

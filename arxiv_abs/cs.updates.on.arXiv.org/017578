The work explores a specific scenario for structural computational optimization based on the following
elements: (a) a relaxed optimization setting considering the ersatz (bi-material) approximation,
(b) a treatment based on a nonsmoothed characteristic function field as a topological design variable,
(c) the consistent derivation of a relaxed topological derivative whose determination is simple,
general and efficient, (d) formulation of the overall increasing cost function topological sensitivity
as a suitable optimality criterion, and (e) consideration of a pseudo-time framework for the problem
solution, ruled by the problem constraint evolution. In this setting, it is shown that the optimization
problem can be analytically solved in a variational framework, leading to, nonlinear, closed-form
algebraic solutions for the characteristic function, which are then solved, in every time-step,
via fixed point methods based on a pseudo-energy cutting algorithm combined with the exact fulfillment
of the constraint, at every iteration of the non-linear algorithm, via a bisection method. The issue
of the ill-posedness (mesh dependency) of the topological solution, is then easily solved via a
Laplacian smoothing of that pseudo-energy. In the aforementioned context, a number of (3D) topological
structural optimization benchmarks are solved, and the solutions obtained with the explored closed-form
solution method, are analyzed, and compared, with their solution through an alternative level
set method. Although the obtained results, in terms of the cost function and topology designs, are
very similar in both methods, the associated computational cost is about five times smaller in the
closedform solution method this possibly being one of its advantages.

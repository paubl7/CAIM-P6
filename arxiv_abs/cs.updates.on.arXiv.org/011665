The temporal amplitude envelope of a signal is essential for its complete characterization, being
the primary information-carrying medium in spoken voice and telecommunications, for example.
Envelope detection techniques have applications in areas like health, sound classification and
synthesis, seismology and speech recognition. Nevertheless, a general method to digital envelope
detection of signals with rich spectral content doesn't exist, as most methods involve manual intervention,
in the form of filter design, smoothing, as well as other specific design choices, based on a priori
knowledge about the nature of the specific waves under investigation. To address this problem,
we propose a framework that uses intrinsic characteristics of a signal to estimate its envelope,
completely eliminating the necessity of parameter tuning. The approach here described draws inspiration
from geometric concepts to isolate the frontiers and thus estimate the temporal envelope of an arbitrary
signal; to that end, alpha-shapes, concave hulls, and discrete curvature are explored. We also
define entities, such as a pulse and frontiers, in the context of an arbitrary digital signal, as
a means to reduce dimensionality and the complexity of the proposed algorithm. Specifically, a
new measure of discrete curvature is used to obtain the average radius of curvature of a discrete
wave, serving as a threshold to identify the wave's frontier points. We find the algorithm accurate
in the identification of the frontiers of a wide range of digital sound waves with very diverse characteristics,
while localizing each pseudo-cycle of the wave in the time domain. The algorithm also compares favourably
with classic envelope detection techniques based on filtering and the Hilbert Transform.

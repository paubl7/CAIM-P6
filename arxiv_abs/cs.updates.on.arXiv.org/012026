Thermal comfort assessment for the built environment has become more available to analysts and
researchers due to the proliferation of sensors and subjective feedback methods. These data can
be used for modeling comfort behavior to support design and operations towards energy efficiency
and well-being. By nature, occupant subjective feedback is imbalanced as indoor conditions are
designed for comfort, and responses indicating otherwise are less common. This situation creates
a scenario for the machine learning workflow where class balancing as a pre-processing step might
be valuable for developing predictive thermal comfort classification models with high-performance.
This paper investigates the various thermal comfort dataset class balancing techniques from the
literature and proposes a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN), $\texttt{comfortGAN}$,
to address this imbalance scenario. These approaches are applied to three publicly available datasets,
ranging from 30 and 67 participants to a global collection of thermal comfort datasets, with 1,474;
2,067; and 66,397 data points, respectively. This work finds that a classification model trained
on a balanced dataset, comprised of real and generated samples from $\texttt{comfortGAN}$, has
higher performance (increase between 4% and 17% in classification accuracy) than other augmentation
methods tested. However, when classes representing discomfort are merged and reduced to three,
better imbalanced performance is expected, and the additional increase in performance by $\texttt{comfortGAN}$
shrinks to 1-2%. These results illustrate that class balancing for thermal comfort modeling is
beneficial using advanced techniques such as GANs, but its value is diminished in certain scenarios.
A discussion is provided to assist potential users in determining which scenarios this process
is useful and which method works best.

A variety of vision ailments are associated with geographic atrophy (GA) in the foveal region of
the eye. In current clinical practice, the ophthalmologist manually detects potential presence
of such GA based on fundus autofluorescence (FAF) images, and hence diagnoses the disease, when
relevant. However, in view of the general scarcity of ophthalmologists relative to the large number
of subjects seeking eyecare, especially in remote regions, it becomes imperative to develop methods
to direct expert time and effort to medically significant cases. Further, subjects from either
disadvantaged background or remote localities, who face considerable economic/physical barrier
in consulting trained ophthalmologists, tend to seek medical attention only after being reasonably
certain that an adverse condition exists. To serve the interest of both the ophthalmologist and
the potential patient, we plan a screening step, where healthy and diseased eyes are algorithmically
differentiated with limited input from only optometrists who are relatively more abundant in number.
Specifically, an early treatment diabetic retinopathy study (ETDRS) grid is placed by an optometrist
on each FAF image, based on which sectoral statistics are automatically collected. Using such statistics
as features, healthy and diseased eyes are proposed to be classified by training an algorithm using
available medical records. In this connection, we demonstrate the efficacy of support vector machines
(SVM). Specifically, we consider SVM with linear as well as radial basis function (RBF) kernel,
and observe satisfactory performance of both variants. Among those, we recommend the latter in
view of its slight superiority in terms of classification accuracy (90.55% at a standard training-to-test
ratio of 80:20), and practical class-conditional costs.

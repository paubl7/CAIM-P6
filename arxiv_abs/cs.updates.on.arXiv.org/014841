Federated learning (FL) and split learning (SL) are state-of-the-art distributed machine learning
techniques to enable machine learning training without accessing raw data on clients or end devices.
However, their \emph{comparative training performance} under real-world resource-restricted
Internet of Things (IoT) device settings, e.g., Raspberry Pi, remains barely studied, which, to
our knowledge, have not yet been evaluated and compared, rendering inconvenient reference for
practitioners. This work firstly provides empirical comparisons of FL and SL in real-world IoT
settings regarding (i) learning performance with heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) on-device
execution overhead. Our analyses in this work demonstrate that the learning performance of SL is
better than FL under an imbalanced data distribution but worse than FL under an extreme non-IID data
distribution. Recently, FL and SL are combined to form splitfed learning (SFL) to leverage each
of their benefits (e.g., parallel training of FL and lightweight on-device computation requirement
of SL). This work then considers FL, SL, and SFL, and mount them on Raspberry Pi devices to evaluate
their performance, including training time, communication overhead, power consumption, and
memory usage. Besides evaluations, we apply two optimizations. Firstly, we generalize SFL by carefully
examining the possibility of a hybrid type of model training at the server-side. The generalized
SFL merges sequential (dependent) and parallel (independent) processes of model training and
is thus beneficial for a system with large-scaled IoT devices, specifically at the server-side
operations. Secondly, we propose pragmatic techniques to substantially reduce the communication
overhead by up to four times for the SL and (generalized) SFL.

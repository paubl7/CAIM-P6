We investigate traffic routing both from the perspective of real world data as well as theory. First,
we reveal through data analytics a natural but previously uncaptured regularity of real world routing
behavior. Agents only consider, in their strategy sets, paths whose free-flow costs (informally
their lengths) are within a small multiplicative $(1+\theta)$ constant of the optimal free-flow
cost path connecting their source and destination where $\theta\geq0$. In the case of Singapore,
$\theta=1$ is a good estimate of agents' route (pre)selection mechanism. In contrast, in Pigou
networks the ratio of the free-flow costs of the routes and thus $\theta$ is infinite, so although
such worst case networks are mathematically simple they correspond to artificial routing scenarios
with little resemblance to real world conditions, opening the possibility of proving much stronger
Price of Anarchy guarantees by explicitly studying their dependency on $\theta$. We provide an
exhaustive analysis of this question by providing provably tight bounds on PoA($\theta$) for arbitrary
classes of cost functions both in the case of general congestion/routing games as well as in the special
case of path-disjoint networks. For example, in the case of the standard Bureau of Public Roads (BPR)
cost model, $c_e(x)= a_e x^4+b_e$ and more generally quartic cost functions, the standard PoA bound
for $\theta=\infty$ is $2.1505$ (Roughgarden, 2003) and it is tight both for general networks as
well as path-disjoint and even parallel-edge networks. In comparison, in the case of $\theta=1$,
the PoA in the case of general networks is only $1.6994$, whereas for path-disjoint/parallel-edge
networks is even smaller ($1.3652$), showing that both the route geometries as captured by the parameter
$\theta$ as well as the network topology have significant effects on PoA (Figure 1).

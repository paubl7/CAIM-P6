H\r{a}stad showed that any De Morgan formula (composed of AND, OR and NOT gates) shrinks by a factor
of $O(p^{2})$ under a random restriction that leaves each variable alive independently with probability
$p$ [SICOMP, 1998]. Using this result, he gave an $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{3})$ formula size lower
bound for the Andreev function, which, up to lower order improvements, remains the state-of-the-art
lower bound for any explicit function. In this work, we extend the shrinkage result of H\r{a}stad
to hold under a far wider family of random restrictions and their generalization -- random projections.
Based on our shrinkage results, we obtain an $\widetilde{\Omega}(n^{3})$ formula size lower bound
for an explicit function computed in $\mathbf{AC}^0$. This improves upon the best known formula
size lower bounds for $\mathbf{AC}^0$, that were only quadratic prior to our work. In addition,
we prove that the KRW conjecture [Karchmer et al., Computational Complexity 5(3/4), 1995] holds
for inner functions for which the unweighted quantum adversary bound is tight. In particular, this
holds for inner functions with a tight Khrapchenko bound. Our random projections are tailor-made
to the function's structure so that the function maintains structure even under projection -- using
such projections is necessary, as standard random restrictions simplify $\mathbf{AC}^0$ circuits.
In contrast, we show that any De Morgan formula shrinks by a quadratic factor under our random projections,
allowing us to prove the cubic lower bound. Our proof techniques build on the proof of H\r{a}stad
for the simpler case of balanced formulas. This allows for a significantly simpler proof at the cost
of slightly worse parameters. As such, when specialized to the case of $p$-random restrictions,
our proof can be used as an exposition of H\r{a}stad's result.

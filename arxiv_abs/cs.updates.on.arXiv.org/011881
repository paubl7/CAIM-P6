In this paper, two nonlinear methods for stabilizing the orientation of a Four-Wheel Independent
Drive and Steering (4WIDS) robot while in the air are analyzed, implemented in simulation, and compared.
AGRO (the Agile Ground Robot) is a 4WIDS inspection robot that can be deployed into unsafe environments
by being thrown, and can use the reaction torque from its four wheels to command its orientation while
in the air. Prior work has demonstrated on a hardware prototype that simple PD control with hand-tuned
gains is sufficient, but hardly optimal, to stabilize the orientation in under 500ms. The goal of
this work is to decrease the stabilization time and reject disturbances using nonlinear control
methods. A model-based Feedback Linearization (FL) was added to compensate for the nonlinear Coriolis
terms. However, with external disturbances, model uncertainty and sensor noise, the FL controller
does not guarantee stability. As an alternative, a second controller was developed using backstepping
methods with an adaptive compensator for external disturbances, model uncertainty, and sensor
offset. The controller was designed using Lyapunov analysis. A simulation was written using the
full nonlinear dynamics of AGRO in an isotropic steering configuration in which control authority
over its pitch and roll are equalized. The PD+FL control method was compared to the backstepping
control method using the same initial conditions in simulation. Both the backstepping controller
and the PD+FL controller stabilized the system within 250 milliseconds. The adaptive backstepping
controller was also able to achieve this performance with the adaptation law enabled and compensating
for offset noisy sinusoidal disturbances.

The concept of biological age (BA), although important in clinical practice, is hard to grasp mainly
due to the lack of a clearly defined reference standard. For specific applications, especially
in pediatrics, medical image data are used for BA estimation in a routine clinical context. Beyond
this young age group, BA estimation is mostly restricted to whole-body assessment using non-imaging
indicators such as blood biomarkers, genetic and cellular data. However, various organ systems
may exhibit different aging characteristics due to lifestyle and genetic factors. Thus, a whole-body
assessment of the BA does not reflect the deviations of aging behavior between organs. To this end,
we propose a new imaging-based framework for organ-specific BA estimation. In this initial study,
we focus mainly on brain MRI. As a first step, we introduce a chronological age (CA) estimation framework
using deep convolutional neural networks (Age-Net). We quantitatively assess the performance
of this framework in comparison to existing state-of-the-art CA estimation approaches. Furthermore,
we expand upon Age-Net with a novel iterative data-cleaning algorithm to segregate atypical-aging
patients (BA $\not \approx$ CA) from the given population. We hypothesize that the remaining population
should approximate the true BA behavior. We apply the proposed methodology on a brain magnetic resonance
image (MRI) dataset containing healthy individuals as well as Alzheimer's patients with different
dementia ratings. We demonstrate the correlation between the predicted BAs and the expected cognitive
deterioration in Alzheimer's patients. A statistical and visualization-based analysis has provided
evidence regarding the potential and current challenges of the proposed methodology.

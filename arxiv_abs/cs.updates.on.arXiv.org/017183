Cartoon face recognition is challenging as they typically have smooth color regions and emphasized
edges, the key to recognize cartoon faces is to precisely perceive their sparse and critical shape
patterns. However, it is quite difficult to learn a shape-oriented representation for cartoon
face recognition with convolutional neural networks (CNNs). To mitigate this issue, we propose
the GraphJigsaw that constructs jigsaw puzzles at various stages in the classification network
and solves the puzzles with the graph convolutional network (GCN) in a progressive manner. Solving
the puzzles requires the model to spot the shape patterns of the cartoon faces as the texture information
is quite limited. The key idea of GraphJigsaw is constructing a jigsaw puzzle by randomly shuffling
the intermediate convolutional feature maps in the spatial dimension and exploiting the GCN to
reason and recover the correct layout of the jigsaw fragments in a self-supervised manner. The proposed
GraphJigsaw avoids training the classification model with the deconstructed images that would
introduce noisy patterns and are harmful for the final classification. Specially, GraphJigsaw
can be incorporated at various stages in a top-down manner within the classification model, which
facilitates propagating the learned shape patterns gradually. GraphJigsaw does not rely on any
extra manual annotation during the training process and incorporates no extra computation burden
at inference time. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results have verified the feasibility
of our proposed GraphJigsaw, which consistently outperforms other face recognition or jigsaw-based
methods on two popular cartoon face datasets with considerable improvements.

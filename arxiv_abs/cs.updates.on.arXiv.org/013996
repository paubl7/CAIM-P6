The property graph is an increasingly popular data model. Pattern construction and pattern matching
are important tasks when dealing with property graphs. Given a property graph schema S, a property
graph G, and a query pattern P, all expressed in language L, pattern matching is the process of finding,
merging, and annotating subgraphs of G that match P. Expressive pattern languages support topological
constraints, property values constraints, negations, quantifications, aggregations, and path
semantics. Calculated properties may be defined for vertices, edges, and subgraphs, and constraints
may be imposed on their evaluation result. Query posers would like to construct patterns with minimal
effort, minimal trial and error, and in a manner that is coherent with the way they think. The ability
to express patterns in a way that is aligned with their mental processes is crucial to the flow of their
work and to the quality of the insights they can draw. Since the capabilities of the human visual system
with respect to pattern perception are remarkable, it is a matter of course that query patterns were
to be expressed visually. Visual query languages have the potential to be much more 'user-friendly'
than their textual counterparts in the sense that patterns may be constructed and understood much
more quickly and with much less mental effort. A long-standing challenge is to design a visual query
language that is generic, has rich expressive power, and is highly receptive and productive. V1
attempts to answer this challenge. V1 is a declarative visual pattern query language for schema-based
property graphs. V1 supports property graphs with mixed (both directed and undirected) edges and
unary edges, with multivalued and composite properties, and with null property values. V1 is generic,
concise, has rich expressive power, and is highly receptive and productive.

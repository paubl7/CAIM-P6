Background: Medical decision-making impacts both individual and public health. Clinical scores
are commonly used among a wide variety of decision-making models for determining the degree of disease
deterioration at the bedside. AutoScore was proposed as a useful clinical score generator based
on machine learning and a generalized linear model. Its current framework, however, still leaves
room for improvement when addressing unbalanced data of rare events. Methods: Using machine intelligence
approaches, we developed AutoScore-Imbalance, which comprises three components: training dataset
optimization, sample weight optimization, and adjusted AutoScore. All scoring models were evaluated
on the basis of their area under the curve (AUC) in the receiver operating characteristic analysis
and balanced accuracy (i.e., mean value of sensitivity and specificity). By utilizing a publicly
accessible dataset from Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, we assessed the proposed model and
baseline approaches in the prediction of inpatient mortality. Results: AutoScore-Imbalance
outperformed baselines in terms of AUC and balanced accuracy. The nine-variable AutoScore-Imbalance
sub-model achieved the highest AUC of 0.786 (0.732-0.839) while the eleven-variable original
AutoScore obtained an AUC of 0.723 (0.663-0.783), and the logistic regression with 21 variables
obtained an AUC of 0.743 (0.685-0.800). The AutoScore-Imbalance sub-model (using down-sampling
algorithm) yielded an AUC of 0. 0.771 (0.718-0.823) with only five variables, demonstrating a good
balance between performance and variable sparsity. Conclusions: The AutoScore-Imbalance tool
has the potential to be applied to highly unbalanced datasets to gain further insight into rare medical
events and to facilitate real-world clinical decision-making.

WiFi fingerprinting is one of the mainstream technologies for indoor localization. However, it
requires an initial calibration phase during which the fingerprint database is built manually.
This process is labour intensive and needs to be repeated with any change in the environment. While
a number of systems have been introduced to reduce the calibration effort through RF propagation
models or crowdsourcing, these still have some limitations. Other approaches use the recently
developed iBeacon technology as an alternative to WiFi for indoor localization. However, these
beacon-based solutions are limited to a small subset of high-end phones. In this paper, we present
HybridLoc: an accurate low-overhead indoor localization system. The basic idea HybridLoc builds
on is to leverage the sensors of high-end phones to enable localization of lower-end phones. Specifically,
the WiFi fingerprint is crowdsourced by opportunistically collecting WiFi-scans labeled with
location data obtained from BLE-enabled high-end smart phones. These scans are used to automatically
construct the WiFi-fingerprint, that is used later to localize any lower-end cell phone with the
ubiquitous WiFi technology. HybridLoc also has provisions for handling the inherent error in the
estimated BLE locations used in constructing the fingerprint as well as to handle practical deployment
issues including the noisy wireless environment, heterogeneous devices, among others. Evaluation
of HybridLoc using Android phones shows that it can provide accurate localization in the same range
as manual fingerprinting techniques under the same conditions. Moreover, the localization accuracy
on low-end phones supporting only WiFi is comparable to that achieved with high-end phones supporting
BLE. This accuracy is achieved with no training overhead, is robust to the different user devices,
and is consistent under environment changes.

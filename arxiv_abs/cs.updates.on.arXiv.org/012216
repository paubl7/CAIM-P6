Real world traffic sign recognition is an important step towards building autonomous vehicles,
most of which highly dependent on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Recent studies demonstrated that
DNNs are surprisingly susceptible to adversarial examples. Many attack methods have been proposed
to understand and generate adversarial examples, such as gradient based attack, score based attack,
decision based attack, and transfer based attacks. However, most of these algorithms are ineffective
in real-world road sign attack, because (1) iteratively learning perturbations for each frame
is not realistic for a fast moving car and (2) most optimization algorithms traverse all pixels equally
without considering their diverse contribution. To alleviate these problems, this paper proposes
the targeted attention attack (TAA) method for real world road sign attack. Specifically, we have
made the following contributions: (1) we leverage the soft attention map to highlight those important
pixels and skip those zero-contributed areas - this also helps to generate natural perturbations,
(2) we design an efficient universal attack that optimizes a single perturbation/noise based on
a set of training images under the guidance of the pre-trained attention map, (3) we design a simple
objective function that can be easily optimized, (4) we evaluate the effectiveness of TAA on real
world data sets. Experimental results validate that the TAA method improves the attack successful
rate (nearly 10%) and reduces the perturbation loss (about a quarter) compared with the popular
RP2 method. Additionally, our TAA also provides good properties, e.g., transferability and generalization
capability. We provide code and data to ensure the reproducibility: https://github.com/AdvAttack/RoadSignAttack.

The current increasing need for privacy-preserving voice communications is leading to new ideas
for securing voice transmission. This paper refers to a relatively new concept of sending encrypted
speech as pseudo-speech in the audio domain over digital voice communication infrastructures,
like 3G cellular network and VoIP. This work presents a novel distortion-tolerant speech encryption
scheme for secure voice communications over voice channels that combines the robustness of analog
speech scrambling and elevated security offered by digital ciphers like AES-CTR. The system scrambles
vocal parameters of a speech signal (loudness, pitch, timbre) using distance-preserving pseudo-random
translations and rotations on a hypersphere of parameters. Next, scrambled parameters are encoded
to a pseudo-speech signal adapted to transmission over digital voice channels equipped with voice
activity detection. Upon reception of this pseudo-speech signal, the legitimate receiver restores
distorted copies of the initial vocal parameters. Despite some deciphering errors, an integrated
neural-based vocoder based on the LPCNet architecture reconstructs an intelligible speech. The
experimental implementation of this speech encryption scheme has been tested by simulations and
sending an encrypted signal over FaceTime between two iPhones 6 connected to the same WiFi network.
Moreover, speech excerpts restored from encrypted signals were evaluated by a speech quality assessment
on a group of about 40 participants. The experiments demonstrated that the proposed scheme produces
intelligible speech with a gracefully progressive quality degradation depending on the channel
noise. Finally, the preliminary computational analysis suggested that the presented setting
may operate on high-end portable devices in nearly real-time.

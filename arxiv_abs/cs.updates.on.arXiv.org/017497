Due to the growing rise of cyber attacks in the Internet, flow-based data sets are crucial to increase
the performance of the Machine Learning (ML) components that run in network-based intrusion detection
systems (IDS). To overcome the existing network traffic data shortage in attack analysis, recent
works propose Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for synthetic flow-based network traffic
generation. Data privacy is appearing more and more as a strong requirement when processing such
network data, which suggests to find solutions where synthetic data can fully replace real data.
Because of the ill-convergence of the GAN training, none of the existing solutions can generate
high-quality fully synthetic data that can totally substitute real data in the training of IDS ML
components. Therefore, they mix real with synthetic data, which acts only as data augmentation
components, leading to privacy breaches as real data is used. In sharp contrast, in this work we propose
a novel deterministic way to measure the quality of the synthetic data produced by a GAN both with
respect to the real data and to its performance when used for ML tasks. As a byproduct, we present a
heuristic that uses these metrics for selecting the best performing generator during GAN training,
leading to a stopping criterion. An additional heuristic is proposed to select the best performing
GANs when different types of synthetic data are to be used in the same ML task. We demonstrate the adequacy
of our proposal by generating synthetic cryptomining attack traffic and normal traffic flow-based
data using an enhanced version of a Wasserstein GAN. We show that the generated synthetic network
traffic can completely replace real data when training a ML-based cryptomining detector, obtaining
similar performance and avoiding privacy violations, since real data is not used in the training
of the ML-based detector.

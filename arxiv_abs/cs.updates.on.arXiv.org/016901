Network slicing is an effective 5G concept for improved resource utilization and service scalability
tailored to users (UEs) requirements. According to the standardization, 5G system should support
UEs through specification of its heterogenous requirements such as, high data rates, traffic density,
latency, reliability, UE density, system efficiency and service availability. These requirements
are specified as Service Level Agreements (SLAs) between UEs and network operators resulting in
increased interest to develop novel challenging mechanisms for improved interference-free resource
efficient performances. An emerging concept that enables such demanding SLA assurances is Open-Radio
Access Network (O-RAN). In this paper, we study a novel resource scheduling problem for UE services
conditioned on other services in network slicing. To improve system performance, we propose that
UEs are connected across network slices to serve several applications. UEs of similar service classes
(defined by SLAs) are grouped to form optimized slice-in-slice category(s) within network slice(s).We
propose novel Predictive Dynamic Scaling Multi-UE service specific System Resource Optimized
Scheduling (DMUSO) algorithm(s). Multiobjective multi-constraint optimization problems (MOP)
are formed to learn the dynamic system resource allocation and throughput for UE services conditioned
on new services entering the network slice. An epsilon-constraint line search algorithm is presented
to estimate UE service bandwidth. Using the theoretical models, DMUSO forms optimal slice-in-slice
categories and estimates the maximum dynamic additional slice-in-slice categories, throughput
served across network slices. Finally, compared to state-of-the-art literatures, DMUSO guarantees
UEs SLAs with 4.4 and 7.5 times performance gains

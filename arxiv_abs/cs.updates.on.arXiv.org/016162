In this work, an efficient physics-constrained deep learning model is developed for solving multiphase
flow in 3D heterogeneous porous media. The model fully leverages the spatial topology predictive
capability of convolutional neural networks, and is coupled with an efficient continuity-based
smoother to predict flow responses that need spatial continuity. Furthermore, the transient regions
are penalized to steer the training process such that the model can accurately capture flow in these
regions. The model takes inputs including properties of porous media, fluid properties and well
controls, and predicts the temporal-spatial evolution of the state variables (pressure and saturation).
While maintaining the continuity of fluid flow, the 3D spatial domain is decomposed into 2D images
for reducing training cost, and the decomposition results in an increased number of training data
samples and better training efficiency. Additionally, a surrogate model is separately constructed
as a postprocessor to calculate well flow rate based on the predictions of state variables from the
deep learning model. We use the example of CO2 injection into saline aquifers, and apply the physics-constrained
deep learning model that is trained from physics-based simulation data and emulates the physics
process. The model performs prediction with a speedup of ~1400 times compared to physics-based
simulations, and the average temporal errors of predicted pressure and saturation plumes are 0.27%
and 0.099% respectively. Furthermore, water production rate is efficiently predicted by a surrogate
model for well flow rate, with a mean error less than 5%. Therefore, with its unique scheme to cope
with the fidelity in fluid flow in porous media, the physics-constrained deep learning model can
become an efficient predictive model for computationally demanding inverse problems or other
coupled processes.

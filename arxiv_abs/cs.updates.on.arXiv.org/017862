In this paper, we propose a convex formulation for learning logistic regression model (logit) with
latent heterogeneous effect on sub-population. In transportation, logistic regression and its
variants are often interpreted as discrete choice models under utility theory (McFadden, 2001).
Two prominent applications of logit models in the transportation domain are traffic accident analysis
and choice modeling. In these applications, researchers often want to understand and capture the
individual variation under the same accident or choice scenario. The mixed effect logistic regression
(mixed logit) is a popular model employed by transportation researchers. To estimate the distribution
of mixed logit parameters, a non-convex optimization problem with nested high-dimensional integrals
needs to be solved. Simulation-based optimization is typically applied to solve the mixed logit
parameter estimation problem. Despite its popularity, the mixed logit approach for learning individual
heterogeneity has several downsides. First, the parametric form of the distribution requires
domain knowledge and assumptions imposed by users, although this issue can be addressed to some
extent by using a non-parametric approach. Second, the optimization problems arise from parameter
estimation for mixed logit and the non-parametric extensions are non-convex, which leads to unstable
model interpretation. Third, the simulation size in simulation-assisted estimation lacks finite-sample
theoretical guarantees and is chosen somewhat arbitrarily in practice. To address these issues,
we are motivated to develop a formulation that models the latent individual heterogeneity while
preserving convexity, and avoids the need for simulation-based approximation. Our setup is based
on decomposing the parameters into a sparse homogeneous component in the population and low-rank
heterogeneous parts for each individual.

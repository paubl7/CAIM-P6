In fetal Magnetic Resonance Imaging, Super Resolution Reconstruction (SRR) algorithms are becoming
popular tools to obtain high-resolution 3D volume reconstructions from low-resolution stacks
of 2D slices, acquired at different orientations. To be effective, these algorithms often require
accurate segmentation of the region of interest, such as the fetal brain in suspected pathological
cases. In the case of Spina Bifida, Ebner, Wang et al. (NeuroImage, 2020) combined their SRR algorithm
with a 2-step segmentation pipeline (2D localisation followed by a 2D segmentation network). However,
if the localisation step fails, the second network is not able to recover a correct brain mask, thus
requiring manual corrections for an effective SRR. In this work, we aim at improving the fetal brain
segmentation for SRR in Spina Bifida. We hypothesise that a well-trained single-step UNet can achieve
accurate performance, avoiding the need of a 2-step approach. We propose a new tool for fetal brain
segmentation called MONAIfbs, which takes advantage of the Medical Open Network for Artificial
Intelligence (MONAI) framework. Our network is based on the dynamic UNet (dynUNet), an adaptation
of the nnU-Net framework. When compared to the original 2-step approach proposed in Ebner-Wang,
and the same Ebner-Wang approach retrained with the expanded dataset available for this work, the
dynUNet showed to achieve higher performance using a single step only. It also showed to reduce the
number of outliers, as only 28 stacks obtained Dice score less than 0.9, compared to 68 for Ebner-Wang
and 53 Ebner-Wang expanded. The proposed dynUNet model thus provides an improvement of the state-of-the-art
fetal brain segmentation techniques, reducing the need for manual correction in automated SRR
pipelines. Our code and our trained model are made publicly available at https://github.com/gift-surg/MONAIfbs.

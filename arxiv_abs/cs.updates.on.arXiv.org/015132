Wire-feed laser additive manufacturing (WLAM) is gaining wide interest due to its high level of
automation, high deposition rates, and good quality of printed parts. In-process monitoring and
feedback controls that would reduce the uncertainty in the quality of the material are in the early
stages of development. Machine learning promises the ability to accelerate the adoption of new
processes and property design in additive manufacturing by making process-structure-property
connections between process setting inputs and material quality outcomes. The molten pool dimensional
information and temperature are the indicators for achieving the high quality of the build, which
can be directly controlled by processing parameters. For the purpose of in situ quality control,
the process parameters should be controlled in real-time based on sensed information from the process,
in particular the molten pool. Thus, the molten pool-process relations are of preliminary importance.
This paper analyzes experimentally collected in situ sensing data from the molten pool under a set
of controlled process parameters in a WLAM system. The variations in the steady-state and transient
state of the molten pool are presented with respect to the change of independent process parameters.
A multi-modality convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is proposed for predicting
the control parameter directly from the measurable molten pool sensor data for achieving desired
geometric and microstructural properties. Dropout and regularization are applied to the CNN architecture
to avoid the problem of overfitting. The results highlighted that the multi-modal CNN, which receives
temperature profile as an external feature to the features extracted from the image data, has improved
prediction performance compared to the image-based uni-modality CNN approach.

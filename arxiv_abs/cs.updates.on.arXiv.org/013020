Molecular photo-switches as, e.g., azobenzene molecules allow, when embedded into a polymeric
matrix, for photo-active polymer compounds responding mechanically when exposed to light of certain
wavelength. Photo-mechanics, i.e. light-matter interaction in photo-active polymers holds
great promise for, e.g., remote and contact-free activation of photo-driven actuators. In a series
of earlier contributions, Oates et al. developed a successful continuum formulation for the coupled
electric, electronic and mechanical problem capturing azobenzene polymer compounds, thereby
mainly focussing on geometrically linearized kinematics. Building on that formulation, we here
explore the variational setting of a geometrically exact continuum framework based on Dirichlet's
and Hamilton's principle as well as, noteworthy, Hamilton's equations. Thereby, when treating
the dissipative case, we resort to incremental versions of the various variational problems via
suited incorporation of a dissipation potential. In particular, the Hamiltonian setting of geometrically
exact photo-mechanics is up to now largely under-explored even for the energetic case, arguably
since the corresponding Lagrangian is degenerate in Dirac's sense. Moreover, in general, the Hamiltonian
setting of dissipative dynamical systems is a matter of ongoing debate per se. In this contribution,
by advocating a novel incremental version of the Hamiltonian setting exemplified for the dissipative
case of photo-mechanics, we aim to also unify the variational approach to dissipative dynamical
systems. Taken together, the variational setting of a geometrically exact continuum framework
of photo-mechanics paves the way for forthcoming theoretical and numerical analyses.

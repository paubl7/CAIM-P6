In this thesis, we focus on the proposal of distributed workflow systems dedicated to the automation
of administrative business processes. We propose an approach to build such systems by relying on
the concepts of multiagent systems, Peer to Peer (P2P) architecture, Service-Oriented Architecture
(SOA) and structured documents (artifacts) cooperative edition. Indeed, we develop mathematical
tools that allow any workflow systems designer, to express each administrative process in the form
of an attributed grammar whose symbols represent tasks to be executed, productions specify a scheduling
of these tasks, and instances (the derivation trees that conform to it) represent the different
execution scenarios leading to business goal states. The obtained grammatical model is then introduced
into a proposed P2P system which is in charge of carrying out the completely decentralised execution
of the underlying process's instances. The said system orchestrates a process's instance execution
as a choreography during which, various software agents driven by human agents (actors), coordinate
themselves through artifacts that they collectively edit. The exchanged artifacts represent
the system's memory: they provide information on already executed tasks, on those ready to be executed
and on their executors. The software agents are autonomous and identical: they execute the same
unique protocol each time they receive an artifact. This protocol allows them to identify the tasks
they must immediately execute, to execute them, to update the artifact and to disseminate it if necessary,
for the continuation of the execution. Moreover, actors potentially have only a partial perception
of processes in which they are involved. In practice, this means that certain tasks can be carried
out confidentially.

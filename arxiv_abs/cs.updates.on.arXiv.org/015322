Context: Previous studies have shown that training data instance selection based on nearest neighborhood
(NN) information can lead to better performance in cross project defect prediction (CPDP) by reducing
heterogeneity in training datasets. However, neighborhood calculation is computationally expensive
and approximate methods such as Locality Sensitive Hashing (LSH) can be as effective as exact methods.
Aim: We aim at comparing instance selection methods for CPDP, namely LSH, NN-filter, and Genetic
Instance Selection (GIS). Method: We conduct experiments with five base learners, optimizing
their hyper parameters, on 13 datasets from PROMISE repository in order to compare the performance
of LSH with benchmark instance selection methods NN-Filter and GIS. Results: The statistical tests
show six distinct groups for F-measure performance. The top two group contains only LSH and GIS benchmarks
whereas the bottom two groups contain only NN-Filter variants. LSH and GIS favor recall more than
precision. In fact, for precision performance only three significantly distinct groups are detected
by the tests where the top group is comprised of NN-Filter variants only. Recall wise, 16 different
groups are identified where the top three groups contain only LSH methods, four of the next six are
GIS only and the bottom five contain only NN-Filter. Finally, NN-Filter benchmarks never outperform
the LSH counterparts with the same base learner, tuned or non-tuned. Further, they never even belong
to the same rank group, meaning that LSH is always significantly better than NN-Filter with the same
learner and settings. Conclusions: The increase in performance and the decrease in computational
overhead and runtime make LSH a promising approach. However, the performance of LSH is based on high
recall and in environments where precision is considered more important NN-Filter should be considered.

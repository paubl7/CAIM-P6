We study a family of reachability problems under waiting-time restrictions in temporal and vertex-colored
temporal graphs. Given a temporal graph and a set of source vertices, we find the set of vertices that
are reachable from a source via a time-respecting path, where the difference in timestamps between
consecutive edges is at most a resting time. Given a vertex-colored temporal graph and a multiset
query of colors, we find the set of vertices reachable from a source via a time-respecting path such
that the vertex colors of the path agree with the multiset query and the difference in timestamps
between consecutive edges is at most a resting time. These kind of problems have several applications
in understanding the spread of a disease in a network, tracing contacts in epidemic outbreaks, finding
signaling pathways in the brain network, and recommending tours for tourists. We present an algebraic
algorithmic framework based on constrained multilinear sieving for solving the restless reachability
problems we propose. In particular, parameterized by the length of a path $k$ sought, we show the
problems can be solved in $O(2^k k m \Delta)$ time and $O(n \tau)$ space, where $n$ is the number of
vertices, $m$ the number of edges, $\Delta$ the maximum resting time and $\tau$ the maximum timestamp
of an input temporal graph. In addition, we prove that the algorithms presented for the restless
reachability problems in vertex-colored temporal graphs are optimal under plausible complexity-theoretic
assumptions. Finally, with an open-source implementation, we demonstrate that our algorithm
scales to large graphs with up to one billion temporal edges, despite the problems being NP-hard.
Specifically, we present extensive experiments to evaluate our scalability claims both on synthetic
and real-world graphs.

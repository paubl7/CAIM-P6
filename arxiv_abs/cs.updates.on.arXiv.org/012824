With robotics rapidly advancing, more effective human-robot interaction is increasingly needed
to realize the full potential of robots for society. While spoken language must be part of the solution,
our ability to provide spoken language interaction capabilities is still very limited. The National
Science Foundation accordingly convened a workshop, bringing together speech, language, and
robotics researchers to discuss what needs to be done. The result is this report, in which we identify
key scientific and engineering advances needed. Our recommendations broadly relate to eight general
themes. First, meeting human needs requires addressing new challenges in speech technology and
user experience design. Second, this requires better models of the social and interactive aspects
of language use. Third, for robustness, robots need higher-bandwidth communication with users
and better handling of uncertainty, including simultaneous consideration of multiple hypotheses
and goals. Fourth, more powerful adaptation methods are needed, to enable robots to communicate
in new environments, for new tasks, and with diverse user populations, without extensive re-engineering
or the collection of massive training data. Fifth, since robots are embodied, speech should function
together with other communication modalities, such as gaze, gesture, posture, and motion. Sixth,
since robots operate in complex environments, speech components need access to rich yet efficient
representations of what the robot knows about objects, locations, noise sources, the user, and
other humans. Seventh, since robots operate in real time, their speech and language processing
components must also. Eighth, in addition to more research, we need more work on infrastructure
and resources, including shareable software modules and internal interfaces, inexpensive hardware,
baseline systems, and diverse corpora.

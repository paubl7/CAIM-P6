Modern semiconductors innovation has a strong relation to scale and skill. While India has a significant
demand for semiconductors, it has a daunting challenge to create a semiconductor ecosystem. Yet,
India has quietly come a long way. Starting with Centers of Excellence in Nanoelectronics (CENs)
initiated in 2006 and broad science and technology funding, India has transformed its nanoelectronics
research ecosystem. From negligible contributions as late as 2011, India has risen to be a top contributor
to IEEE Electron Devices journals today. Our study presents important observations in terms of
ecosystem development. First, there is a 6 year incubation time from infrastructure initiation
to first papers. Then, 4 more years to become globally competitive. Second, growth in experimental
research is essential along with modeling and simulations. Finally, the aspirational goals of
translational research to contribute to the global technology roadmap requires cutting edge manufacturing
infrastructure and ecosystem access, which still needs development. The learning informs a call
to action for the research ecosystem i.e. academia, industry, and policy-makers. First, sustain
and amplify successful strategies of national research infrastructure and funding growth. Second,
enhance international collaborations to add further scale and infrastructure to RnD. Finally,
strengthen the industry-academia-policy consortium approach to transform to an innovation-based
economy. Ultimately, the electron devices community is entering an exciting phase where Beyond
Moore offers open opportunities in materials, devices to systems, and algorithms. India must build
on its success to play a significant role in this new world of disruptive innovation.

Cardiac segmentation of atriums, ventricles, and myocardium in computed tomography (CT) images
is an important first-line task for presymptomatic cardiovascular disease diagnosis. In several
recent studies, deep learning models have shown significant breakthroughs in medical image segmentation
tasks. Unlike other organs such as the lungs and liver, the cardiac organ consists of multiple substructures,
i.e., ventricles, atriums, aortas, arteries, veins, and myocardium. These cardiac substructures
are proximate to each other and have indiscernible boundaries (i.e., homogeneous intensity values),
making it difficult for the segmentation network focus on the boundaries between the substructures.
In this paper, to improve the segmentation accuracy between proximate organs, we introduce a novel
model to exploit shape and boundary-aware features. We primarily propose a shape-aware attention
module, that exploits distance regression, which can guide the model to focus on the edges between
substructures so that it can outperform the conventional contour-based attention method. In the
experiments, we used the Multi-Modality Whole Heart Segmentation dataset that has 20 CT cardiac
images for training and validation, and 40 CT cardiac images for testing. The experimental results
show that the proposed network produces more accurate results than state-of-the-art networks
by improving the Dice similarity coefficient score by 4.97%. Our proposed shape-aware contour
attention mechanism demonstrates that distance transformation and boundary features improve
the actual attention map to strengthen the responses in the boundary area. Moreover, our proposed
method significantly reduces the false-positive responses of the final output, resulting in accurate
segmentation.

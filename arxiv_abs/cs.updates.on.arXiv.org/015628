With growth in the use of autonomous Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) for automated data collection
from construction projects, the problem of inter-disciplinary semantic data sharing and exchanges
between construction and robotic domains has attracted construction stakeholders' attention.
Cross-domain data translation requires detailed specifications especially when it comes to semantic
data translation. Building Information Modeling (BIM) and Geographic Information System (GIS)
are the two technologies to capture and store construction data for indoor structure and outdoor
environment respectively. In the absence of a standard format for data exchanges between the construction
and robotic domains, the tools of both industries are yet to be integrated in a coherent deployment
infrastructure. Hence, the semantics of BIM-GIS cannot be automatically integrated by any robotic
platform. To enable semantic data transfer across domains, semantic web technology has been widely
used in multidisciplinary areas for interoperability. We exploit it to pave the way to a smarter,
quicker and more precise robot navigation on job-sites. This paper develops a semantic web ontology
integrating robot navigation and data collection to convey the meanings from BIM-GIS to the robot.
The proposed Building Information Robotic System (BIRS) provides construction data that are semantically
transferred to the robotic platform and can be used by the robot navigation software stack on construction
sites. To reach this objective, we first need to bridge the knowledge representation between construction
and robotic domains. Then, we develop a semantic database to integrate with Robot Operating System
(ROS) which can communicate with the robot and the navigation system in order to provide the robot
with semantic building data at each step of data collection. Finally, the proposed system is validated
through a case study.

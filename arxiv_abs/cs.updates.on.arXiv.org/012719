With the steady growth of the amount of real-time data while drilling, operational decision-making
is becoming both better informed and more complex. Therefore, as no human brain has the capacity
to interpret and integrate all decision-relevant information from the data, the adoption of advanced
algorithms is required not only for data interpretation but also for decision optimization itself.
However, the advantages of the automatic decision-making are hard to quantify. The main contribution
of this paper is an experiment in which we compare the decision skills of geosteering experts with
those of an automatic decision support system in a fully controlled synthetic environment. The
implementation of the system, hereafter called DSS-1, is presented in our earlier work [Alyaev
et al. "A decision support system for multi-target geosteering." Journal of Petroleum Science
and Engineering 183 (2019)]. For the current study we have developed an easy-to-use web-based platform
which can visualize and update uncertainties in a 2D geological model. The platform has both user
and application interfaces (GUI and API) allowing us to put human participants and DSS-1 into a similar
environment and conditions. The results of comparing 29 geoscientists with DSS-1 over three experimental
rounds showed that the automatic algorithm outperformed 28 participants. What's more, no expert
has beaten DSS-1 more than once over the three rounds, giving it the best comparative rating among
the participants. By design DSS-1 performs consistently, that is, identical problem setup is guaranteed
to yield identical decisions. The study showed that only two experts managed to demonstrate partial
consistency within a tolerance but ended up with much lower scores.

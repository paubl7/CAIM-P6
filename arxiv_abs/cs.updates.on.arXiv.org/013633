Motivation: Molecular interaction networks summarize complex biological processes as graphs,
whose structure is informative of biological function at multiple scales. Simultaneously, omics
technologies measure the variation or activity of genes, proteins, or metabolites across individuals
or experimental conditions. Integrating the complementary viewpoints of biological networks
and omics data is an important task in bioinformatics, but existing methods treat networks as discrete
structures, which are intrinsically difficult to integrate with continuous node features or activity
measures. Graph neural networks map graph nodes into a low-dimensional vector space representation,
and can be trained to preserve both the local graph structure and the similarity between node features.
Results: We studied the representation of transcriptional, protein-protein and genetic interaction
networks in E. Coli and mouse using graph neural networks. We found that such representations explain
a large proportion of variation in gene expression data, and that using gene expression data as node
features improves the reconstruction of the graph from the embedding. We further proposed a new
end-to-end graph feature auto-encoder which is trained on the feature reconstruction task, and
showed that it performs better at predicting unobserved node features than auto-encoders that
are trained on the graph reconstruction task before learning to predict node features. When applied
to the problem of imputing missing data in single-cell RNAseq data, our graph feature auto-encoder
outperformed a state-of-the-art imputation method that does not use protein interaction information,
showing the benefit of integrating biological networks and omics data using graph representation
learning.

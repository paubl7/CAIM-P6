Biological and cultural evolution show a trend towards increasing hierarchical organization,
in which entities at one level combine cooperatively to form a new entity at a higher level of organization.
In each case where such a cooperative transition has been studied, we have some understanding of
how the transition came about, but it is difficult to formulate a unified theory that covers all of
these transitions. John Stewart has proposed a theoretical framework called Management Theory,
which attempts to explain all of the major cooperative transitions in biological and cultural evolution.
The idea is that successful transitions require the integration of managers and workers into a cooperative
organization. This theory seems appropriate when we consider the cultural evolution of corporations,
where managers and workers are clearly essential, but it seems less plausible when we consider the
biological evolution of entities that do not invite anthropomorphic projection. However, in the
following article, we define managers and workers in an abstract way that enables us to apply these
terms over a broad range of cases, including cultural evolution, biological evolution, and computational
simulations of evolution. The core idea is that a worker is an entity that takes the main role in the
production of something and a manager is an entity that plays a supporting role in the production
of something. We apply this abstract view of managers and workers to a computational simulation
of evolving cooperative transitions in John Conway's Game of Life. The simulation confirms the
expectations of Management Theory: Manager-worker relations result in robust and productive
cooperation, whereas workers without managers tend to lack robustness, and managers without workers
tend to lack productivity.

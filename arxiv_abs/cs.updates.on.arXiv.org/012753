Recently, the outbreak of the novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has seriously
endangered human health and life. Due to limited availability of test kits, the need for auxiliary
diagnostic approach has increased. Recent research has shown radiography of COVID-19 patient,
such as CT and X-ray, contains salient information about the COVID-19 virus and could be used as an
alternative diagnosis method. Chest X-ray (CXR) due to its faster imaging time, wide availability,
low cost and portability gains much attention and becomes very promising. Computational methods
with high accuracy and robustness are required for rapid triaging of patients and aiding radiologist
in the interpretation of the collected data. In this study, we design a novel multi-feature convolutional
neural network (CNN) architecture for multi-class improved classification of COVID-19 from CXR
images. CXR images are enhanced using a local phase-based image enhancement method. The enhanced
images, together with the original CXR data, are used as an input to our proposed CNN architecture.
Using ablation studies, we show the effectiveness of the enhanced images in improving the diagnostic
accuracy. We provide quantitative evaluation on two datasets and qualitative results for visual
inspection. Quantitative evaluation is performed on data consisting of 8,851 normal (healthy),
6,045 pneumonia, and 3,323 Covid-19 CXR scans. In Dataset-1, our model achieves 95.57\% average
accuracy for a three classes classification, 99\% precision, recall, and F1-scores for COVID-19
cases. For Dataset-2, we have obtained 94.44\% average accuracy, and 95\% precision, recall, and
F1-scores for detection of COVID-19. Conclusions: Our proposed multi-feature guided CNN achieves
improved results compared to single-feature CNN proving the importance of the local phase-based
CXR image enhancement.

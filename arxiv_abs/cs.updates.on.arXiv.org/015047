The remarkable practical success of deep learning has revealed some major surprises from a theoretical
perspective. In particular, simple gradient methods easily find near-optimal solutions to non-convex
optimization problems, and despite giving a near-perfect fit to training data without any explicit
effort to control model complexity, these methods exhibit excellent predictive accuracy. We conjecture
that specific principles underlie these phenomena: that overparametrization allows gradient
methods to find interpolating solutions, that these methods implicitly impose regularization,
and that overparametrization leads to benign overfitting. We survey recent theoretical progress
that provides examples illustrating these principles in simpler settings. We first review classical
uniform convergence results and why they fall short of explaining aspects of the behavior of deep
learning methods. We give examples of implicit regularization in simple settings, where gradient
methods lead to minimal norm functions that perfectly fit the training data. Then we review prediction
methods that exhibit benign overfitting, focusing on regression problems with quadratic loss.
For these methods, we can decompose the prediction rule into a simple component that is useful for
prediction and a spiky component that is useful for overfitting but, in a favorable setting, does
not harm prediction accuracy. We focus specifically on the linear regime for neural networks, where
the network can be approximated by a linear model. In this regime, we demonstrate the success of gradient
flow, and we consider benign overfitting with two-layer networks, giving an exact asymptotic analysis
that precisely demonstrates the impact of overparametrization. We conclude by highlighting the
key challenges that arise in extending these insights to realistic deep learning settings.

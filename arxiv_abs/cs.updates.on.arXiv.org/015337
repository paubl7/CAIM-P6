To limit the spread of the novel coronavirus on college campuses, a common strategy for the Fall 2020
and Spring 2021 terms has been to offer instruction weighted toward hybrid or fully online modalities.
Colleges are now considering whether and how to expand hybrid or fully in-person instruction for
future terms, and learn lessons from this experience for future use. Our paper uses Fall 2019 enrollment
data for a medium-sized public American university to analyze whether some student groupings by
class standing or course level are more susceptible to the spread of infectious disease through
academic enrollment networks. Replicating Weeden and Cornwell [8], we find that enrollment networks
at the institution are "small worlds" characterized by high clustering, short average path lengths,
and multiple independent connections. Connectivity decreases as class standing (graduate vs.
undergraduate; senior vs. freshman) and course level increase; as students move from generalized
to specialized course loads, networks cluster by major. Holding other factors constant, policies
focusing on in-person instruction for lower division students conflict with the greater risk of
infectious spread through a lower division network in the absence of additional steps to minimize
academic connectivity. There are academic and financial incentives for emphasizing the freshman
experience, including concerns about student attrition from the first to second academic year
and recouping costs of infrastructure investments in dormitories. Possible solutions could include
(i) restricting face-to-face or hybrid instruction to courses in students' academic majors, which
would disrupt larger networks into smaller ones and thus restrict the spread of infection across
majors, and (ii) take a "scalpel" approach to instruction modes by moving online courses most likely
to facilitate epidemic spread.

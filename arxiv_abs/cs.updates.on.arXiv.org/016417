Objective is to assess the ability of texture features for detecting radiographic patellofemoral
osteoarthritis (PFOA) from knee lateral view radiographs. We used lateral view knee radiographs
from MOST public use datasets (n = 5507 knees). Patellar region-of-interest (ROI) was automatically
detected using landmark detection tool (BoneFinder). Hand-crafted features, based on LocalBinary
Patterns (LBP), were then extracted to describe the patellar texture. First, a machine learning
model (Gradient Boosting Machine) was trained to detect radiographic PFOA from the LBP features.
Furthermore, we used end-to-end trained deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) directly on
the texture patches for detecting the PFOA. The proposed classification models were eventually
compared with more conventional reference models that use clinical assessments and participant
characteristics such as age, sex, body mass index(BMI), the total WOMAC score, and tibiofemoral
Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grade. Atlas-guided visual assessment of PFOA status by expert readers
provided in the MOST public use datasets was used as a classification outcome for the models. Performance
of prediction models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
(ROC AUC), the area under the precision-recall (PR) curve-average precision (AP)-, and Brier score
in the stratified 5-fold cross validation setting.Of the 5507 knees, 953 (17.3%) had PFOA. AUC and
AP for the strongest reference model including age, sex, BMI, WOMAC score, and tibiofemoral KL grade
to predict PFOA were 0.817 and 0.487, respectively. Textural ROI classification using CNN significantly
improved the prediction performance (ROC AUC= 0.889, AP= 0.714). We present the first study that
analyses patellar bone texture for diagnosing PFOA. Our results demonstrates the potential of
using texture features of patella to predict PFOA.

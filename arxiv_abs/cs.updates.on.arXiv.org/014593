Cyber-physical systems (CPS) are interconnected architectures that employ analog, digital,
and communication resources for their interaction with the physical environment. CPS are the backbone
of enterprise, industrial, and critical infrastructure. Thus, their vital importance makes them
prominent targets for malicious attacks aiming to disrupt their operations. Attacks targeting
cyber-physical energy systems (CPES), given their mission-critical nature, can have disastrous
consequences. The security of CPES can be enhanced leveraging testbed capabilities to replicate
power system operations, discover vulnerabilities, develop security countermeasures, and evaluate
grid operation under fault-induced or maliciously constructed scenarios. In this paper, we provide
a comprehensive overview of the CPS security landscape with emphasis on CPES. Specifically, we
demonstrate a threat modeling methodology to accurately represent the CPS elements, their interdependencies,
as well as the possible attack entry points and system vulnerabilities. Leveraging the threat model
formulation, we present a CPS framework designed to delineate the hardware, software, and modeling
resources required to simulate the CPS and construct high-fidelity models which can be used to evaluate
the system's performance under adverse scenarios. The system performance is assessed using scenario-specific
metrics, while risk assessment enables system vulnerability prioritization factoring the impact
on the system operation. The overarching framework for modeling, simulating, assessing, and mitigating
attacks in a CPS is illustrated using four representative attack scenarios targeting CPES. The
key objective of this paper is to demonstrate a step-by-step process that can be used to enact in-depth
cybersecurity analyses, thus leading to more resilient and secure CPS.

Clinical decision making about treatments and interventions based on personal characteristics
leads to effective health improvement. Machine learning (ML) has been the central concern of the
diagnosis support and disease prediction based on comprehensive patient information. Because
the black-box problem in ML is serious for medical applications, explainable artificial intelligence
(XAI) techniques to explain the reasons for ML models predictions have been focused. A remaining
important issue in clinical situations is discovery of concrete and realistic treatment processes.
This paper proposes an innovative framework to plan concrete treatment processes based on an ML
model. A key point of our proposed framework is to evaluate an "actionability" of the treatment process
using a stochastic surrogate model constructed through hierarchical Bayesian modeling. The actionability
is an essential concept for suggesting a realistic treatment process, which leads to clinical applications
for personal health improvement. This paper also presents two experiments to evaluate our framework.
We first demonstrate the feasibility of our framework from the viewpoint of the methodology using
a synthetic dataset. Subsequently, our framework is applied to an actual health checkup dataset,
which comprises 3,132 participants, considering an application to improve systolic blood pressure
values at a personal level. We confirmed that the computed treatment processes are actionable and
consistent with clinical knowledge for lowering blood pressure. These results demonstrate that
our framework can contribute to decision making in the medical field. Our framework can be expected
to provide clinicians deeper insights by proposing concrete and actionable treatment process
based on the ML model.

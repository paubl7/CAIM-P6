Gross Target Volume (GTV) segmentation plays an irreplaceable role in radiotherapy planning for
Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (NPC). Despite that convolutional neural networks (CNN) have achieved
good performance for this task, they rely on a large set of labeled images for training, which is expensive
and time-consuming to acquire. Recently, semi-supervised methods that learn from a small set of
labeled images with a large set of unlabeled images have shown potential for dealing with this problem,
but it is still challenging to train a high-performance model with the limited number of labeled
data. In this paper, we propose a novel framework with Uncertainty Rectified Pyramid Consistency
(URPC) regularization for semi-supervised NPC GTV segmentation. Concretely, we extend a backbone
segmentation network to produce pyramid predictions at different scales, the pyramid predictions
network (PPNet) was supervised by the ground truth of labeled images and a multi-scale consistency
loss for unlabeled images, motivated by the fact that prediction at different scales for the same
input should be similar and consistent. However, due to the different resolution of these predictions,
encouraging them to be consistent at each pixel directly is not robust and may bring much noise and
lead to a performance drop. To deal with this dilemma, we further design a novel uncertainty rectifying
module to enable the framework to gradually learn from meaningful and reliable consensual regions
at different scales. Extensive experiments on our collected NPC dataset with 258 volumes show that
our method can largely improve performance by incorporating the unlabeled data, and this framework
achieves a promising result compared with existing semi-supervised methods, which achieves 81.22%
of mean DSC and 1.88 voxels of mean ASD on the test set, where the only 20% of the training set were annotated.

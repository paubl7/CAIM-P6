A phase-field description of brittle fracture is employed in the reported four-point bending analyses
of monolithic and laminated glass plates. Our aims are: (i) to compare different phase-field fracture
formulations applied to thin glass plates, (ii) to assess the consequences of the dimensional reduction
of the problem and mesh density and refinement, and (iii) to validate for quasi-static loading the
time/temperature-dependent material properties we derived recently for two commonly used polymer
foils made of Polyvinyl Butyral or Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate. As the nonlinear response prior to fracture,
typical of the widely used Bourdin-Francfort-Marigo model, can lead to a significant overestimation
of the response of thin plates under bending, the numerical study investigates two additional phase-field
fracture models providing the linear elastic phase of the stress-strain diagram. The typical values
of the critical fracture energy and tensile strength of glass lead to a phase-field length-scale
parameter that is challenging to resolve in the numerical simulations. So, we show how to determine
the fracture energy concerning the applied dimensional reduction and the value of the length-scale
parameter relative to the thickness of the plate. The comparison shows that the phase-field models
provide very good agreement with the measured stresses and resistance of laminated glass, despite
the fact that only one/two cracks localised using the quasi-static analysis, whereas multiple
cracks evolved during the experiment. It has also been observed that the stiffness and resistance
of the partially fractured laminated glass can be well approximated using a 2D plane-stress model
with initially predefined cracks, which provides a better estimation than the one-glass-layer
limit.}

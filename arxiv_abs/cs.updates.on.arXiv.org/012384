The subgraph-centric programming model is a promising approach and has been applied in many state-of-the-art
distributed graph computing frameworks. The graph partition algorithm plays an important role
in the overall performance of subgraph-centric frameworks. However, traditional graph partition
algorithms have significant difficulties in processing large-scale power-law graphs. The major
problem is the communication bottleneck found in many subgraph-centric frameworks. Detailed
analysis indicates that the communication bottleneck is caused by the huge communication volume
or the extreme message imbalance among partitioned subgraphs. The traditional partition algorithms
do not consider both factors at the same time, especially on power-law graphs. In this paper, we propose
a novel efficient and balanced greedy graph partition algorithm (EBG) which grants appropriate
weights to the overall communication cost reduction and communication balance. We observe that
the number of replicated vertices and the balance of edge and vertex assignment have a great influence
on communication patterns of distributed subgraph-centric frameworks, which further affect
the overall performance. Based on this insight, we design an evaluation function that quantifies
the proportion of replicated vertices and the balance of edges and vertices assignments as important
parameters. Experiments show that EBG reduces replication factor and communication by 32.3% and
24.3% respectively than other balanced partition algorithms. When deployed in the subgraph-centric
framework, it reduces the running time on power-law graphs by an average of 25.4% compared with the
state-of-the-art partition algorithm. Our results indicate that EBG has a great potential in improving
the performance of subgraph-centric frameworks for the parallel large-scale power-law graph
processing.

Determining when and whether to provide personalized support is a well-known challenge called
the assistance dilemma. A core problem in solving the assistance dilemma is the need to discover
when students are unproductive so that the tutor can intervene. Such a task is particularly challenging
for open-ended domains, even those that are well-structured with defined principles and goals.
In this paper, we present a set of data-driven methods to classify, predict, and prevent unproductive
problem-solving steps in the well-structured open-ended domain of logic. This approach leverages
and extends the Hint Factory, a set of methods that leverages prior student solution attempts to
build data-driven intelligent tutors. We present a HelpNeed classification, that uses prior student
data to determine when students are likely to be unproductive and need help learning optimal problem-solving
strategies. We present a controlled study to determine the impact of an Adaptive pedagogical policy
that provides proactive hints at the start of each step based on the outcomes of our HelpNeed predictor:
productive vs. unproductive. Our results show that the students in the Adaptive condition exhibited
better training behaviors, with lower help avoidance, and higher help appropriateness (a higher
chance of receiving help when it was likely to be needed), as measured using the HelpNeed classifier,
when compared to the Control. Furthermore, the results show that the students who received Adaptive
hints based on HelpNeed predictions during training significantly outperform their Control peers
on the posttest, with the former producing shorter, more optimal solutions in less time. We conclude
with suggestions on how these HelpNeed methods could be applied in other well-structured open-ended
domains.

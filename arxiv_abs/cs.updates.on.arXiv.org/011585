Power management of nanogrid cluster assisted by a novel peer-to-peer(P2P) electricity trading
is presented. In our work, several nanogrids are integrated into a nanogrid cluster and unbalance
of power consumption among clusters is mitigated by the proposed P2P trading method. For power management
of individual clusters, multi-objective optimization simultaneously minimizing total power
consumption, portion of grid power in total power consumption, and total delay incurred by scheduling
is attempted. Types of loads involved in power management of nanogrid cluster are flexible loads
allowing scheduling and non-flexible loads. Renewable power source photovoltaic(PV) system
is adopted for each cluster as a secondary source. Temporal surplus of self-supply PV power of a cluster
can be sold through P2P trading to other cluster(s) experiencing temporal shortage. The cluster
in temporal shortage of electric power buys the surplus PV power and uses it to reduce peak load and
total delay. In P2P trading, a cooperative game model is used for buyers and sellers to maximize their
welfare. To increase the efficiency of P2P trading measured by reduction of peak load and total delay,
future trends of load demand and PV power production are taken into account for power management
of each cluster unlike conventional P2P trading to resolve instantaneous unbalance between load
demand and PV power production. To this end, a gated recurrent unit network is used to forecast future
load demand and future PV power production. The effectiveness of the proposed P2P trading method
for nanogrid cluster is verified by simulations. According to simulation results, proposed P2P
trading causes peak load reduction in peak hours, reduction of grid power consumption, and total
delay.

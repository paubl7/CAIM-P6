CANs are a broadcast protocol for real-time communication of critical vehicle subsystems. Original
equipment manufacturers of passenger vehicles hold secret their mappings of CAN data to vehicle
signals, and these definitions vary according to make, model, and year. Without these mappings,
the wealth of real-time vehicle information hidden in the CAN packets is uninterpretable, impeding
vehicle-related research. Guided by the 4-part CAN signal definition, we present CAN-D (CAN-Decoder),
a modular, 4-step pipeline for identifying each signal's boundaries (start bit, length), endianness
(byte order), signedness (bit-to-integer encoding), and by leveraging diagnostic standards,
augmenting a subset of the extracted signals with physical interpretation. We provide a comprehensive
review of the CAN signal reverse engineering research. Previous methods ignore endianness and
signedness, rendering them incapable of decoding many standard CAN signal definitions. Incorporating
endianness grows the search space from 128 to 4.72E21 signal tokenizations and introduces a web
of changing dependencies. We formulate, formally analyze, and provide an efficient solution to
an optimization problem, allowing identification of the optimal set of signal boundaries and byte
orderings. We provide two novel, state-of-the-art signal boundary classifiers-both superior
to previous approaches in precision and recall in three different test scenarios-and the first
signedness classification algorithm which exhibits a $>$97\% F-score. CAN-D is the only solution
with the potential to extract any CAN signal. In evaluation on 10 vehicles, CAN-D's average $\ell^1$
error is 5x better than all previous methods and exhibits lower ave. error, even when considering
only signals that meet prior methods' assumptions. CAN-D is implemented in lightweight hardware,
allowing for an OBD-II plugin for real-time in-vehicle CAN decoding.

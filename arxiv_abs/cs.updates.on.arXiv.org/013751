Stress and driving are a dangerous combination which can lead to crashes, as evidenced by the large
number of road traffic crashes that involve stress. Motivated by the need to address the significant
costs of driver stress, it is essential to build a practical system that can classify driver stress
level with high accuracy. However, the performance of an accurate driving stress levels classification
system depends on hyperparameter optimization choices such as data segmentation (windowing hyperparameters).
The configuration setting of hyperparameters, which has an enormous impact on the system performance,
are typically hand-tuned while evaluating the algorithm. This tuning process is time consuming
and often depends on personal experience. There are also no generic optimal values for hyperparameters
values. In this work, we propose a meta-heuristic approach to support automated hyperparameter
optimization and provide a real-time driver stress detection system. This is the first systematic
study of optimizing windowing hyperparameters based on Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal in the
domain of driving safety. Our approach is to propose a framework based on Particle Swarm Optimization
algorithm (PSO) to select an optimal/near optimal windowing hyperparameters values. The performance
of the proposed framework is evaluated on two datasets: a public dataset (DRIVEDB dataset) and our
collected dataset using an advanced simulator. DRIVEDB dataset was collected in a real time driving
scenario, and our dataset was collected using an advanced driving simulator in the control environment.
We demonstrate that optimising the windowing hyperparameters yields significant improvement
in terms of accuracy. The most accurate built model applied to the public dataset and our dataset,
based on the selected windowing hyperparameters, achieved 92.12% and 77.78% accuracy, respectively.

Recently, a standardized framework was proposed for introducing quantum-inspired moves in mathematical
games with perfect information and no chance. The beauty of quantum games-succinct in representation,
rich in structures, explosive in complexity, dazzling for visualization, and sophisticated for
strategic reasoning-has drawn us to play concrete games full of subtleties and to characterize
abstract properties pertinent to complexity consequence. Going beyond individual games, we explore
the tractability of quantum combinatorial games as whole, and address fundamental questions including:
Quantum Leap in Complexity: Are there polynomial-time solvable games whose quantum extensions
are intractable? Quantum Collapses in Complexity: Are there PSPACE-complete games whose quantum
extensions fall to the lower levels of the polynomial-time hierarchy? Quantumness Matters: How
do outcome classes and strategies change under quantum moves? Under what conditions doesn't quantumness
matter? PSPACE Barrier for Quantum Leap: Can quantum moves launch PSPACE games into outer polynomial
space We show that quantum moves not only enrich the game structure, but also impact their computational
complexity. In settling some of these basic questions, we characterize both the powers and limitations
of quantum moves as well as the superposition of game configurations that they create. Our constructive
proofs-both on the leap of complexity in concrete Quantum Nim and Quantum Undirected Geography
and on the continuous collapses, in the quantum setting, of complexity in abstract PSPACE-complete
games to each level of the polynomial-time hierarchy-illustrate the striking computational landscape
over quantum games and highlight surprising turns with unexpected quantum impact. Our studies
also enable us to identify several elegant open questions fundamental to quantum combinatorial
game theory (QCGT).

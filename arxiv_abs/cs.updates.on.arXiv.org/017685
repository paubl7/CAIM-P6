Being light-weight and cost-effective, IR-based approaches for bug localization have shown promise
in finding software bugs. However, the accuracy of these approaches heavily depends on their used
bug reports. A significant number of bug reports contain only plain natural language texts. According
to existing studies, IR-based approaches cannot perform well when they use these bug reports as
search queries. On the other hand, there is a piece of recent evidence that suggests that even these
natural language-only reports contain enough good keywords that could help localize the bugs successfully.
On one hand, these findings suggest that natural language-only bug reports might be a sufficient
source for good query keywords. On the other hand, they cast serious doubt on the query selection
practices in the IR-based bug localization. In this article, we attempted to clear the sky on this
aspect by conducting an in-depth empirical study that critically examines the state-of-the-art
query selection practices in IR-based bug localization. In particular, we use a dataset of 2,320
bug reports, employ ten existing approaches from the literature, exploit the Genetic Algorithm-based
approach to construct optimal, near-optimal search queries from these bug reports, and then answer
three research questions. We confirmed that the state-of-the-art query construction approaches
are indeed not sufficient for constructing appropriate queries (for bug localization) from certain
natural language-only bug reports although they contain such queries. We also demonstrate that
optimal queries and non-optimal queries chosen from bug report texts are significantly different
in terms of several keyword characteristics, which has led us to actionable insights. Furthermore,
we demonstrate 27%--34% improvement in the performance of non-optimal queries through the application
of our actionable insights to them.

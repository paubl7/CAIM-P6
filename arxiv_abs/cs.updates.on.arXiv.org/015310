In customer contact centers, a successful service interaction involves a messaging dialogue between
a customer and agent. Both parties depend on one another for information and problem solving. In
this paper, we propose, develop, and compare new stochastic models for service co-production in
a contact center. A key observation is that the customer and agent's co-produced service has cross-
and self-exciting dynamics within each conversation. The cross-excitation stems from the two
parties responding to one another, and the self-excitation captures one party sending follow-ups
to their own prior message. We capture this phenomenon by introducing Hawkes process models of the
services. These models distinguish between the role of the customer and of the agent, reflect the
service process's dynamic evolution over time based on its own history, and include additional
behavioral and operational aspects, including the agent's number of simultaneous assignments
and measures of the amount of information and sentiment each message contains. To evaluate our service
co-production models, we apply them to an industry contact center dataset containing nearly 5 million
messages. We show that the Hawkes models better represent the service dynamics than do the classic
Poisson and phase-type models. Indeed, we find that service interactions are characterized by
strong agent-customer dependency and the centrality of the process's cross- and self-excitation
attributes. Finally, we use the proposed models to improve upon routing algorithms used in contact
centers. We show how an activity-based dynamic routing based on predicted information easily computed
from our models can outperform well-known and widely used concurrency-based routing rules and
substantially reduce customer waiting time, demonstrating how these history-dependent stochastic
models can improve operational decision making in practice.

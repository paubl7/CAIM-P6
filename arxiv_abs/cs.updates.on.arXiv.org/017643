By amalgamating recent communication and control technologies, computing and data analytics
techniques, and modular manufacturing, Industry~4.0 promotes integrating cyber-physical worlds
through cyber-physical systems (CPS) and digital twin (DT) for monitoring, optimization, and
prognostics of industrial processes. A DT is an emerging but conceptually different construct
than CPS. Like CPS, DT relies on communication to create a highly-consistent, synchronized digital
mirror image of the objects or physical processes. DT, in addition, uses built-in models on this
precise image to simulate, analyze, predict, and optimize their real-time operation using feedback.
DT is rapidly diffusing in the industries with recent advances in the industrial Internet of things
(IIoT), edge and cloud computing, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and advanced data
analytics. However, the existing literature lacks in identifying and discussing the role and requirements
of these technologies in DT-enabled industries from the communication and computing perspective.
In this article, we first present the functional aspects, appeal, and innovative use of DT in smart
industries. Then, we elaborate on this perspective by systematically reviewing and reflecting
on recent research in next-generation (NextG) wireless technologies (e.g., 5G and beyond networks),
various tools (e.g., age of information, federated learning, data analytics), and other promising
trends in networked computing (e.g., edge and cloud computing). Moreover, we discuss the DT deployment
strategies at different industrial communication layers to meet the monitoring and control requirements
of industrial applications. We also outline several key reflections and future research challenges
and directions to facilitate industrial DT's adoption.

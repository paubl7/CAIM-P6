It has been an important task for recommender systems to suggest satisfying activities to a group
of users in people's daily social life. The major challenge in this task is how to aggregate personal
preferences of group members to infer the decision of a group. Conventional group recommendation
methods applied a predefined strategy for preference aggregation. However, these static strategies
are too simple to model the real and complex process of group decision-making, especially for occasional
groups which are formed ad-hoc. Moreover, group members should have non-uniform influences or
weights in a group, and the weight of a user can be varied in different groups. Therefore, an ideal
group recommender system should be able to accurately learn not only users' personal preferences
but also the preference aggregation strategy from data. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end
group recommender system named CAGR (short for Centrality Aware Group Recommender"), which takes
Bipartite Graph Embedding Model (BGEM), the self-attention mechanism and Graph Convolutional
Networks (GCNs) as basic building blocks to learn group and user representations in a unified way.
Specifically, we first extend BGEM to model group-item interactions, and then in order to overcome
the limitation and sparsity of the interaction data generated by occasional groups, we propose
a self-attentive mechanism to represent groups based on the group members. In addition, to overcome
the sparsity issue of user-item interaction data, we leverage the user social networks to enhance
user representation learning, obtaining centrality-aware user representations. We create three
large-scale benchmark datasets and conduct extensive experiments on them. The experimental results
show the superiority of our proposed CAGR by comparing it with state-of-the-art group recommender
models.

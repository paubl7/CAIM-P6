Social scientists and psychologists take interest in understanding how people express emotions
and sentiments when dealing with catastrophic events such as natural disasters, political unrest,
and terrorism. The COVID-19 pandemic is a catastrophic event that has raised a number of psychological
issues such as depression given abrupt social changes and lack of employment. Advancements of deep
learning-based language models have been promising for sentiment analysis with data from social
networks such as Twitter. Given the situation with COVID-19 pandemic, different countries had
different peaks where the rise and fall of new cases affected lock-downs which directly affected
the economy and employment. During the rise of COVID-19 cases with stricter lock-downs, people
have been expressing their sentiments in social media. This can provide a deep understanding of
human psychology during catastrophic events. In this paper, we present a framework that employs
deep learning-based language models via long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks
for sentiment analysis during the rise of novel COVID-19 cases in India. The framework features
LSTM language model with a global vector embedding and state-of-art BERT language model. We review
the sentiments expressed for selective months in 2020 which covers the first major peak of novel
cases in India. Our framework utilises multi-label sentiment classification where more than one
sentiment can be expressed at once. Our results indicate that the majority of the tweets have been
positive with high levels of optimism during the rise of the novel COVID-19 cases and the number of
tweets significantly lowered towards the peak. The predictions generally indicate that although
the majority have been optimistic, a significant group of population has been annoyed towards the
way the pandemic was handled by the authorities.

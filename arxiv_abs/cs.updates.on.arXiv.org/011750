Multi-view data, in which data of different types are obtained from a common set of samples, is now
common in many scientific problems. An important problem in the analysis of multi-view data is identifying
interactions between groups of features from different data types. A bimodule is a pair $(A,B)$
of feature sets from two different data types such that the aggregate cross-correlation between
the features in $A$ and those in $B$ is large. A bimodule $(A,B)$ is stable if $A$ coincides with the
set of features having significant aggregate correlation with the features in $B$, and vice-versa.
At the population level, stable bimodules correspond to connected components of the cross-correlation
network, which is the bipartite graph whose edges are pairs of features with non-zero cross-correlations.
We develop an iterative, testing-based procedure, called BSP, to identify stable bimodules in
two moderate- to high-dimensional data sets. BSP relies on permutation-based p-values for sums
of squared cross-correlations. We efficiently approximate the p-values using tail probabilities
of gamma distributions that are fit using analytical estimates of the permutation moments of the
test statistic. Our moment estimates depend on the eigenvalues of the intra-correlation matrices
of $A$ and $B$ and as a result, the significance of observed cross-correlations accounts for the
correlations within each data type. We carry out a thorough simulation study to assess the performance
of BSP, and present an extended application of BSP to the problem of expression quantitative trait
loci (eQTL) analysis using recent data from the GTEx project. In addition, we apply BSP to climatology
data in order to identify regions in North America where annual temperature variation affects precipitation.

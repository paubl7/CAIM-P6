Obesity and being over-weight add to the risk of some major life threatening diseases. According
to W.H.O., a considerable population suffers from these disease whereas poor nutrition plays an
important role in this context. Traditional food activity monitoring systems like Food Diaries
allow manual record keeping of eating activities over time, and conduct nutrition analysis. However,
these systems are prone to the problems of manual record keeping and biased-reporting. Therefore,
recently, the research community has focused on designing automatic food monitoring systems since
the last decade which consist of one or multiple wearable sensors. These systems aim at providing
different macro and micro activity detections like chewing, swallowing, eating episodes, and
food types as well as estimations like food mass and eating duration. Researchers have emphasized
on high detection accuracy, low estimation errors, un-intrusive nature, low cost and real life
implementation while designing these systems, however a comprehensive automatic food monitoring
system has yet not been developed. Moreover, according to the best of our knowledge, there is no comprehensive
survey in this field that delineates the automatic food monitoring paradigm, covers a handful number
of research studies, analyses these studies against food intake monitoring tasks using various
parameters, enlists the limitations and sets up future directions. In this research work, we delineate
the automatic food intake monitoring paradigm and present a survey of research studies. With special
focus on studies with wearable sensors, we analyze these studies against food activity monitoring
tasks. We provide brief comparison of these studies along with shortcomings based upon experimentation
results conducted under these studies. We setup future directions at the end to facilitate the researchers
working in this domain.

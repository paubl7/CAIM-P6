The sustaining evolution of sensing and advancement in communications technologies have revolutionized
prognostics and health management for various electrical equipment towards data-driven ways.
This revolution delivers a promising solution for the health monitoring problem of heat pump (HP)
system, a vital device widely deployed in modern buildings for heating use, to timely evaluate its
operation status to avoid unexpected downtime. Many HPs were practically manufactured and installed
many years ago, resulting in fewer sensors available due to technology limitations and cost control
at that time. It raises a dilemma to safeguard HPs at an affordable cost. We propose a hybrid scheme
by integrating industrial Internet-of-Things (IIoT) and intelligent health monitoring algorithms
to handle this challenge. To start with, an IIoT network is constructed to sense and store measurements.
Specifically, temperature sensors are properly chosen and deployed at the inlet and outlet of the
water tank to measure water temperature. Second, with temperature information, we propose an unsupervised
learning algorithm named mixture slow feature analysis (MSFA) to timely evaluate the health status
of the integrated HP. Characterized by frequent operation switches of different HPs due to the variable
demand for hot water, various heating patterns with different heating speeds are observed. Slowness,
a kind of dynamics to measure the varying speed of steady distribution, is properly considered in
MSFA for both heating pattern division and health evaluation. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed
method is verified through a real integrated HP with five connected HPs installed ten years ago.
The experimental results show that MSFA is capable of accurately identifying health status of the
system, especially failure at a preliminary stage compared to its competing algorithms.

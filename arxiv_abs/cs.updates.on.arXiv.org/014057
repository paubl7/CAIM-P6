Visual object tracking, which is representing a major interest in image processing field, has facilitated
numerous real world applications. Among them, equipping unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) with real
time robust visual trackers for all day aerial maneuver, is currently attracting incremental attention
and has remarkably broadened the scope of applications of object tracking. However, prior tracking
methods have merely focused on robust tracking in the well-illuminated scenes, while ignoring
trackers' capabilities to be deployed in the dark. In darkness, the conditions can be more complex
and harsh, easily posing inferior robust tracking or even tracking failure. To this end, this work
proposed a novel discriminative correlation filter based tracker with illumination adaptive
and anti dark capability, namely ADTrack. ADTrack firstly exploits image illuminance information
to enable adaptability of the model to the given light condition. Then, by virtue of an efficient
and effective image enhancer, ADTrack carries out image pretreatment, where a target aware mask
is generated. Benefiting from the mask, ADTrack aims to solve a dual regression problem where dual
filters, i.e., the context filter and target focused filter, are trained with mutual constraint.
Thus ADTrack is able to maintain continuously favorable performance in all-day conditions. Besides,
this work also constructed one UAV nighttime tracking benchmark UAVDark135, comprising of more
than 125k manually annotated frames, which is also very first UAV nighttime tracking benchmark.
Exhaustive experiments are extended on authoritative daytime benchmarks, i.e., UAV123 10fps,
DTB70, and the newly built dark benchmark UAVDark135, which have validated the superiority of ADTrack
in both bright and dark conditions on a single CPU.

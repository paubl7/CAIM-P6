Using evolutionary computation algorithms to solve multiple tasks with knowledge sharing is a
promising approach. Image feature learning can be considered as a multitask problem because different
tasks may have a similar feature space. Genetic programming (GP) has been successfully applied
to image feature learning for classification. However, most of the existing GP methods solve one
task, independently, using sufficient training data. No multitask GP method has been developed
for image feature learning. Therefore, this paper develops a multitask GP approach to image feature
learning for classification with limited training data. Owing to the flexible representation
of GP, a new knowledge sharing mechanism based on a new individual representation is developed to
allow GP to automatically learn what to share across two tasks and to improve its learning performance.
The shared knowledge is encoded as a common tree, which can represent the common/general features
of two tasks. With the new individual representation, each task is solved using the features extracted
from a common tree and a task-specific tree representing task-specific features. To learn the best
common and task-specific trees, a new evolutionary process and new fitness functions are developed.
The performance of the proposed approach is examined on six multitask problems of 12 image classification
datasets with limited training data and compared with three GP and 14 non-GP-based competitive
methods. Experimental results show that the new approach outperforms these compared methods in
almost all the comparisons. Further analysis reveals that the new approach learns simple yet effective
common trees with high effectiveness and transferability.

A central challenge in the computational modeling of neural dynamics is the trade-off between accuracy
and simplicity. At the level of individual neurons, nonlinear dynamics are both experimentally
established and essential for neuronal functioning. An implicit assumption has thus formed that
an accurate computational model of whole-brain dynamics must also be highly nonlinear, whereas
linear models may provide a first-order approximation. Here, we provide a rigorous and data-driven
investigation of this hypothesis at the level of whole-brain blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD)
and macroscopic field potential dynamics by leveraging the theory of system identification. Using
functional MRI (fMRI) and intracranial EEG (iEEG), we model the resting state activity of 700 subjects
in the Human Connectome Project (HCP) and 122 subjects from the Restoring Active Memory (RAM) project
using state-of-the-art linear and nonlinear model families. We assess relative model fit using
predictive power, computational complexity, and the extent of residual dynamics unexplained
by the model. Contrary to our expectations, linear auto-regressive models achieve the best measures
across all three metrics, eliminating the trade-off between accuracy and simplicity. To understand
and explain this linearity, we highlight four properties of macroscopic neurodynamics which can
counteract or mask microscopic nonlinear dynamics: averaging over space, averaging over time,
observation noise, and limited data samples. Whereas the latter two are technological limitations
and can improve in the future, the former two are inherent to aggregated macroscopic brain activity.
Our results, together with the unparalleled interpretability of linear models, can greatly facilitate
our understanding of macroscopic neural dynamics and the principled design of model-based interventions
for the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders.

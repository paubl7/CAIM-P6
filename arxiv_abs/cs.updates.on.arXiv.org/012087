We establish stable finite element (FE) approximations of convection-diffusion initial boundary
value problems using the automatic variationally stable finite element (AVS-FE) method. The transient
convection-diffusion problem leads to issues in classical FE methods as the differential operator
can be considered singular perturbation in both space and time. The unconditional stability of
the AVS-FE method, regardless of the underlying differential operator, allows us significant
flexibility in the construction of FE approximations. We take two distinct approaches to the FE
discretization of the convection-diffusion problem: i) considering a space-time approach in
which the temporal discretization is established using finite elements, and ii) a method of lines
approach in which we employ the AVS-FE method in space whereas the temporal domain is discretized
using the generalized-alpha method. In the generalized-alpha method, we discretize the temporal
domain into finite sized time-steps and adopt the generalized-alpha method as time integrator.
Then, we derive a corresponding norm for the obtained operator to guarantee the temporal stability
of the method. We present numerical verifications for both approaches, including numerical asymptotic
convergence studies highlighting optimal convergence properties. Furthermore, in the spirit
of the discontinuous Petrov-Galerkin method by Demkowicz and Gopalakrishnan, the AVS-FE method
also leads to readily available a posteriori error estimates through a Riesz representer of the
residual of the AVS-FE approximations. Hence, the norm of the resulting local restrictions of these
estimates serve as error indicators in both space and time for which we present multiple numerical
verifications adaptive strategies.

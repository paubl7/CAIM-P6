To build commercial robots, skid-steering mechanical design is of increased popularity due to
its manufacturing simplicity and unique mechanism. However, these also cause significant challenges
on software and algorithm design, especially for pose estimation (i.e., determining the robot's
rotation and position), which is the prerequisite of autonomous navigation. While the general
localization algorithms have been extensively studied in research communities, there are still
fundamental problems that need to be resolved for localizing skid-steering robots that change
their orientation with a skid. To tackle this problem, we propose a probabilistic sliding-window
estimator dedicated to skid-steering robots, using measurements from a monocular camera, the
wheel encoders, and optionally an inertial measurement unit (IMU). Specifically, we explicitly
model the kinematics of skid-steering robots by both track instantaneous centers of rotation (ICRs)
and correction factors, which are capable of compensating for the complexity of track-to-terrain
interaction, the imperfectness of mechanical design, terrain conditions and smoothness, and
so on. To prevent performance reduction in robots' lifelong missions, the time- and location- varying
kinematic parameters are estimated online along with pose estimation states in a tightly-coupled
manner. More importantly, we conduct in-depth observability analysis for different sensors and
design configurations in this paper, which provides us with theoretical tools in making the correct
choice when building real commercial robots. In our experiments, we validate the proposed method
by both simulation tests and real-world experiments, which demonstrate that our method outperforms
competing methods by wide margins.

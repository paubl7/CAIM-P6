Traffic near-crash events serve as critical data sources for various smart transportation applications,
such as being surrogate safety measures for traffic safety research and corner case data for automated
vehicle testing. However, there are several key challenges for near-crash detection. First, extracting
near-crashes from original data sources requires significant computing, communication, and
storage resources. Also, existing methods lack efficiency and transferability, which bottlenecks
prospective large-scale applications. To this end, this paper leverages the power of edge computing
to address these challenges by processing the video streams from existing dashcams onboard in a
real-time manner. We design a multi-thread system architecture that operates on edge devices and
model the bounding boxes generated by object detection and tracking in linear complexity. The method
is insensitive to camera parameters and backward compatible with different vehicles. The edge
computing system has been evaluated with recorded videos and real-world tests on two cars and four
buses for over ten thousand hours. It filters out irrelevant videos in real-time thereby saving
labor cost, processing time, network bandwidth, and data storage. It collects not only event videos
but also other valuable data such as road user type, event location, time to collision, vehicle trajectory,
vehicle speed, brake switch, and throttle. The experiments demonstrate the promising performance
of the system regarding efficiency, accuracy, reliability, and transferability. It is among the
first efforts in applying edge computing for real-time traffic video analytics and is expected
to benefit multiple sub-fields in smart transportation research and applications.

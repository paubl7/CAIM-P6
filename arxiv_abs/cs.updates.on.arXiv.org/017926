Leading proposals for Advanced Air Mobility (AAM) recognize the need for strategic and tactical
airspace deconfliction, where the need for coordination appears in different forms and nuances.
One recurring element is the use of pre-defined airways or corridors, a natural way to create order,
with proven success from the conventional, manned, Air Traffic Management (ATM). But, while ATM
is evolving to 4D Trajectory-Based Operations, when we apply the ATM principles to very dense and
potentially more complex operations such as AAM, we have to consider their limitations in such demanding
new environment. The requirement of following circulation corridors most often increase flight
distance and inevitably create bottlenecks, hence we explore the hypothesis of not using corridors,
testing such option via a simple and scalable simulation model. Other motivations for comparing
different forms of traffic coordination are redundancy and diversity, which have potential to
increase system safety. Relying on a single method to maintain traffic separation of course would
not be allowed in practice. However, the concepts that we have seen so far leave a gap between two very
distinct and co-existing methods: one, cooperative and centered on a ground-based Provider of
Services for UAM (PSU), and another, which is mostly non-cooperative and independent, centered
on the individual aircraft, commonly referred to as Detect-And-Avoid (DAA). This duality achieves
a welcomed diversity, however presents several points for improvement. In-between these opposite
methods, this paper analyzes the performance of an airborne cooperative method to coordinate traffic
which is capable of safely solving conflicts of multiple aircraft (more than two) and achieve higher
efficiency than DAA alone, thus with potential for being an alternative or a live fallback for ground-based
traffic coordination.

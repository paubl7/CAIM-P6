Digitalization opens up new opportunities in the collection, analysis, and presentation of data
which can contribute to the achievement of the 2030 Agenda and its Sustainable Development Goals
(SDGs). In particular, the access to and control of environmental and geospatial data is fundamental
to identify and understand global issues and trends. Also immediate crises such as the COVID-19
pandemic demonstrate the importance of accurate health data such as infection statistics and the
relevance of digital tools like video conferencing platforms. However, today much of the data is
collected and processed by private actors. Thus, governments and researchers depend on data platforms
and proprietary systems of big tech companies such as Google or Microsoft. The market capitalization
of the seven largest US and Chinese big tech companies has grown to 8.7tn USD in recent years, about
twice the size of Germany's gross domestic product (GDP). Therefore, their market power is enormous,
allowing them to dictate many rules of the digital space and even interfere with legislations. Based
on a literature review and nine expert interviews this study presents a framework that identifies
the risks and consequences along the workflow of collecting, processing, storing, using of data.
It also includes solutions that governmental and multilateral actors can strive for to alleviate
the risks. Fundamental to this framework is the novel concept of "data colonialism" which describes
today's trend of private companies appropriating the digital sphere. Historically, colonial
nations used to grab indigenous land and exploit the cheap labor of slave workers. In a similar way,
today's big tech corporations use cheap data of their users to produce valuable services and thus
create enormous market power.

Background and Objective: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial as it has high mortality rate
with patients commonly present with the disease at stage 3 and above. There are only relatively few
methods that simultaneously detect and classify nodules from computed tomography (CT) scans.
Furthermore, very few studies have used semi-supervised learning for lung cancer prediction.
This study presents a complete end-to-end scheme to detect and classify lung nodules using the state-of-the-art
Self-training with Noisy Student method on a comprehensive CT lung screening dataset of around
4,000 CT scans. Methods: We used three datasets, namely LUNA16, LIDC and NLST, for this study. We
first utilise a three-dimensional deep convolutional neural network model to detect lung nodules
in the detection stage. The classification model known as Maxout Local-Global Network uses non-local
networks to detect global features including shape features, residual blocks to detect local features
including nodule texture, and a Maxout layer to detect nodule variations. We trained the first Self-training
with Noisy Student model to predict lung cancer on the unlabelled NLST datasets. Then, we performed
Mixup regularization to enhance our scheme and provide robustness to erroneous labels. Results
and Conclusions: Our new Mixup Maxout Local-Global network achieves an AUC of 0.87 on 2,005 completely
independent testing scans from the NLST dataset. Our new scheme significantly outperformed the
next highest performing method at the 5% significance level using DeLong's test (p = 0.0001). This
study presents a new complete end-to-end scheme to predict lung cancer using Self-training with
Noisy Student combined with Mixup regularization. On a completely independent dataset of 2,005
scans, we achieved state-of-the-art performance even with more images as compared to other methods.

Retinal vessel segmentation is a crucial step in diagnosing and screening various diseases, including
diabetes, ophthalmologic diseases, and cardiovascular diseases. In this paper, we propose an
effective and efficient method for vessel segmentation in color fundus images using encoder-decoder
based octave convolution networks. Compared with other convolution networks utilizing standard
convolution for feature extraction, the proposed method utilizes octave convolutions and octave
transposed convolutions for learning multiple-spatial-frequency features, thus can better
capture retinal vasculatures with varying sizes and shapes. To provide the network the capability
of learning how to decode multifrequency features, we extend octave convolution and propose a new
operation named octave transposed convolution. A novel architecture of convolutional neural
network, named as Octave UNet integrating both octave convolutions and octave transposed convolutions
is proposed based on the encoder-decoder architecture of UNet, which can generate high resolution
vessel segmentation in one single forward feeding without post-processing steps. Comprehensive
experimental results demonstrate that the proposed Octave UNet outperforms the baseline UNet
achieving better or comparable performance to the state-of-the-art methods with fast processing
speed. Specifically, the proposed method achieves 0.9664 / 0.9713 / 0.9759 / 0.9698 accuracy, 0.8374
/ 0.8664 / 0.8670 / 0.8076 sensitivity, 0.9790 / 0.9798 / 0.9840 / 0.9831 specificity, 0.8127 / 0.8191
/ 0.8313 / 0.7963 F1 score, and 0.9835 / 0.9875 / 0.9905 / 0.9845 Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic
curve, on DRIVE, STARE, CHASE_DB1, and HRF datasets, respectively.

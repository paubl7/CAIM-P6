Fluorescence microscopy allows for a detailed inspection of cells, cellular networks, and anatomical
landmarks by staining with a variety of carefully-selected markers visualized as color channels.
Quantitative characterization of structures in acquired images often relies on automatic image
analysis methods. Despite the success of deep learning methods in other vision applications, their
potential for fluorescence image analysis remains underexploited. One reason lies in the considerable
workload required to train accurate models, which are normally specific for a given combination
of markers, and therefore applicable to a very restricted number of experimental settings. We herein
propose Marker Sampling and Excite, a neural network approach with a modality sampling strategy
and a novel attention module that together enable (i) flexible training with heterogeneous datasets
with combinations of markers and (ii) successful utility of learned models on arbitrary subsets
of markers prospectively. We show that our single neural network solution performs comparably
to an upper bound scenario where an ensemble of many networks is na\"ively trained for each possible
marker combination separately. In addition, we demonstrate the feasibility of this framework
in high-throughput biological analysis by revising a recent quantitative characterization of
bone marrow vasculature in 3D confocal microscopy datasets and further confirm the validity of
our approach on an additional, significantly different dataset of microvessels in fetal liver
tissues. Not only can our work substantially ameliorate the use of deep learning in fluorescence
microscopy analysis, but it can also be utilized in other fields with incomplete data acquisitions
and missing modalities.

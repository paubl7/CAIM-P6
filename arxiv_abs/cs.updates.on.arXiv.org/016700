Rethinking cities is now more imperative than ever, as society is facing challenges such as population
growth and climate change. The design of cities can not be abstracted from the design of its mobility
system, and, therefore, efficient solutions must be found to transport people and goods throughout
the city in an ecological way. An autonomous bicycle-sharing system that combines the benefits
of vehicle sharing, electrification, autonomy, and micro-mobility could increase the efficiency
and convenience of bicycle-sharing systems incentivizing more people to bike and enjoy their cities
in an environmentally friendly way. Due to the uniqueness and radical novelty of introducing autonomous
driving technology into bicycle-sharing systems and the inherent complexity of these systems,
there is a need to quantify the potential impact of autonomy on fleet performance and user experience.
This paper presents an ad-hoc agent-based, discrete event simulator that provides an in-depth
understanding of the fleet behavior of autonomous bicycle-sharing systems in the most realistic
possible scenarios, including a rebalancing system based on demand prediction. In addition, this
work quantifies the extent to which an autonomous system would outperform current bicycle-sharing
schemes and describes the impact of different parameters on system efficiency and service quality.
This research shows that with a fleet size three and a half times smaller than a station-based system
and eight times smaller than a dockless system, an autonomous system can provide overall improved
performance and user experience even with no rebalancing. These findings indicate that the remarkable
efficiency of an autonomous bicycle-sharing system could compensate for the additional cost of
autonomous bicycles.

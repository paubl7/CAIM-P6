Although Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has been an active research topic for decades,
current state-of-the-art methods still suffer from instability or inaccuracy due to feature insufficiency
or its inherent estimation drift, in many civilian environments. To resolve these issues, we propose
a navigation system combing the SLAM and prior-map-based localization. Specifically, we consider
additional integration of line and plane features, which are ubiquitous and more structurally
salient in civilian environments, into the SLAM to ensure feature sufficiency and localization
robustness. More importantly, we incorporate general prior map information into the SLAM to restrain
its drift and improve the accuracy. To avoid rigorous association between prior information and
local observations, we parameterize the prior knowledge as low dimensional structural priors
defined as relative distances/angles between different geometric primitives. The localization
is formulated as a graph-based optimization problem that contains sliding-window-based variables
and factors, including IMU, heterogeneous features, and structure priors. We also derive the analytical
expressions of Jacobians of different factors to avoid the automatic differentiation overhead.
To further alleviate the computation burden of incorporating structural prior factors, a selection
mechanism is adopted based on the so-called information gain to incorporate only the most effective
structure priors in the graph optimization. Finally, the proposed framework is extensively tested
on synthetic data, public datasets, and, more importantly, on the real UAV flight data obtained
from a building inspection task. The results show that the proposed scheme can effectively improve
the accuracy and robustness of localization for autonomous robots in civilian applications.

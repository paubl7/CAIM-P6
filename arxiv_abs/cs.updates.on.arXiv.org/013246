Reproducibility should be a cornerstone of science as it enables validation and reuse. In recent
years, the scientific community and the general public became increasingly aware of the reproducibility
crisis, i.e. the wide-spread inability of researchers to reproduce published work, including
their own. Scientific research is increasingly focused on the creation, observation, processing,
and analysis of large data volumes. On the one hand, this transition towards computational and data-intensive
science poses new challenges for research reproducibility and reuse. On the other hand, increased
availability and advances in computation and web technologies offer new opportunities to address
the reproducibility crisis. This thesis reports on user-centered design research conducted at
CERN, a key laboratory in data-intensive particle physics. In this thesis, we build a wider understanding
of researchers' interactions with tools that support research documentation, preservation,
and sharing. From a Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) perspective the following aspects are fundamental:
(1) Characterize and map requirements and practices around research preservation and reuse. (2)
Understand the wider role and impact of research data management (RDM) tools in scientific workflows.
(3) Design tools and interactions that promote, motivate, and acknowledge reproducible research
practices. Research reported in this thesis represents the first systematic application of HCI
methods in the study and design of interactive tools for reproducible science. We advocate the unique
role of HCI in supporting, motivating, and transforming reproducible research practices through
the design of tools that enable effective RDM. This thesis paves new ways for interaction with RDM
tools that support and motivate reproducible science.

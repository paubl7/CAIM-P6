Modeling infection spread during pandemics is not new, with models using past data to tune simulation
parameters for predictions. These help understand the healthcare burden posed by a pandemic and
respond accordingly. However, the problem of how college/university campuses should function
during a pandemic is new for the following reasons:(i) social contact in colleges are structured
and can be engineered for chosen objectives, (ii) the last pandemic to cause such societal disruption
was over 100 years ago, when higher education was not a critical part of society, (ii) not much was
known about causes of pandemics, and hence effective ways of safe operations were not known, and
(iii) today with distance learning, remote operation of an academic institution is possible. Our
approach is unique in presenting a flexible simulation system, containing a suite of model libraries,
one for each major component. The system integrates agent based modeling (ABM) and stochastic network
approach, and models the interactions among individual entities, e.g., students, instructors,
classrooms, residences, etc. in great detail. For each decision to be made, the system can be used
to predict the impact of various choices, and thus enable the administrator to make informed decisions.
While current approaches are good for infection modeling, they lack accuracy in social contact
modeling. Our ABM approach, combined with ideas from Network Science, presents a novel approach
to contact modeling. A detailed case study of the University of Minnesota's Sunrise Plan is presented.
For each decisions made, its impact was assessed, and results used to get a measure of confidence.
We believe this flexible tool can be a valuable asset for various kinds of organizations to assess
their infection risks in pandemic-time operations, including middle and high schools, factories,
warehouses, and small/medium sized businesses.

Millimeter wave (mmWave) and terahertz MIMO systems rely on pre-defined beamforming codebooks
for both initial access and data transmission. Being pre-defined, however, these codebooks are
commonly not optimized for specific environments, user distributions, and/or possible hardware
impairments. This leads to large codebook sizes with high beam training overhead which increases
the initial access/tracking latency and makes it hard for these systems to support highly mobile
applications. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a deep reinforcement learning
framework that learns how to iteratively optimize the codebook beam patterns (shapes) relying
only on the receive power measurements and without requiring any explicit channel knowledge. The
developed model learns how to autonomously adapt the beam patterns to best match the surrounding
environment, user distribution, hardware impairments, and array geometry. Further, this approach
does not require any knowledge about the channel, array geometry, RF hardware, or user positions.
To reduce the learning time, the proposed model designs a novel Wolpertinger-variant architecture
that is capable of efficiently searching for an optimal policy in a large discrete action space,
which is important for large antenna arrays with quantized phase shifters. This complex-valued
neural network architecture design respects the practical RF hardware constraints such as the
constant-modulus and quantized phase shifter constraints. Simulation results based on the publicly
available DeepMIMO dataset confirm the ability of the developed framework to learn near-optimal
beam patterns for both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-LOS scenarios and for arrays with hardware impairments
without requiring any channel knowledge.

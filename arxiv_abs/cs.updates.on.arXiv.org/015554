The aim of the systematic review was to assess recently published studies on diagnostic test accuracy
of glioblastoma treatment response monitoring biomarkers in adults, developed through machine
learning (ML). Articles were searched for using MEDLINE, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Register. Included
study participants were adult patients with high grade glioma who had undergone standard treatment
(maximal resection, radiotherapy with concomitant and adjuvant temozolomide) and subsequently
underwent follow-up imaging to determine treatment response status. Risk of bias and applicability
was assessed with QUADAS 2 methodology. Contingency tables were created for hold-out test sets
and recall, specificity, precision, F1-score, balanced accuracy calculated. Fifteen studies
were included with 1038 patients in training sets and 233 in test sets. To determine whether there
was progression or a mimic, the reference standard combination of follow-up imaging and histopathology
at re-operation was applied in 67% of studies. The small numbers of patient included in studies,
the high risk of bias and concerns of applicability in the study designs (particularly in relation
to the reference standard and patient selection due to confounding), and the low level of evidence,
suggest that limited conclusions can be drawn from the data. There is likely good diagnostic performance
of machine learning models that use MRI features to distinguish between progression and mimics.
The diagnostic performance of ML using implicit features did not appear to be superior to ML using
explicit features. There are a range of ML-based solutions poised to become treatment response
monitoring biomarkers for glioblastoma. To achieve this, the development and validation of ML
models require large, well-annotated datasets where the potential for confounding in the study
design has been carefully considered.

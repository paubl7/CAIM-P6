Evaluation of the demand for emerging transportation technologies and policies can vary by time
of day due to spillbacks on roadways, rescheduling of travelers' activity patterns, and shifting
to other modes that affect the level of congestion. These effects are not well-captured with static
travel demand models. We calibrate and validate the first open-source multi-agent simulation
model for New York City, called MATSim-NYC, to support agencies in evaluating policies such as congestion
pricing. The simulation-based virtual test bed is loaded with an 8M+ synthetic 2016 population
calibrated in a prior study. The road network is calibrated to INRIX speed data and average annual
daily traffic for a screenline along the East River crossings, resulting in average speed differences
of 7.2% on freeways and 17.1% on arterials, leading to average difference of +1.8% from the East River
screenline. Validation against transit stations shows an 8% difference from observed counts and
median difference of 29% for select road link counts. The model is used to evaluate a congestion pricing
plan proposed by the Regional Plan Association and suggests a much higher (127K) car trip reduction
compared to their report (59K). The pricing policy would impact the population segment making trips
within Manhattan differently from the population segment of trips outside Manhattan. The multiagent
simulation can show that 37.3% of the Manhattan segment would be negatively impacted by the pricing
compared to 39.9% of the non-Manhattan segment, which has implications for redistribution of congestion
pricing revenues. The citywide travel consumer surplus decreases when the congestion pricing
goes up from $9.18 to $14 both ways even as it increases for the Charging-related population segment.
This implies that increasing pricing from $9.18 to $14 benefits Manhattanites at the expense of
the rest of the city.

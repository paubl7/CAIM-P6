The proposed method re-frames traditional inverse problems of electrocardiography into regression
problems, constraining the solution space by decomposing signals with multidimensional Gaussian
impulse basis functions. Impulse HSPs were generated with single Gaussian basis functions at discrete
heart surface locations and projected to corresponding BSPs using a volume conductor torso model.
Both BSP (inputs) and HSP (outputs) were mapped to regular 2D surface meshes and used to train a neural
network. Predictive capabilities of the network were tested with unseen synthetic and experimental
data. A dense full connected single hidden layer neural network was trained to map body surface impulses
to heart surface Gaussian basis functions for reconstructing HSP. Synthetic pulses moving across
the heart surface were predicted from the neural network with root mean squared error of $9.1\pm1.4$%.
Predicted signals were robust to noise up to 20 dB and errors due to displacement and rotation of the
heart within the torso were bounded and predictable. A shift of the heart 40 mm toward the spine resulted
in a 4\% increase in signal feature localization error. The set of training impulse function data
could be reduced and prediction error remained bounded. Recorded HSPs from in-vitro pig hearts
were reliably decomposed using space-time Gaussian basis functions. Predicted HSPs for left-ventricular
pacing had a mean absolute error of $10.4\pm11.4$ ms. Other pacing scenarios were analyzed with
similar success. Conclusion: Impulses from Gaussian basis functions are potentially an effective
and robust way to train simple neural network data models for reconstructing HSPs from decomposed
BSPs. The HSPs predicted by the neural network can be used to generate activation maps that non-invasively
identify features of cardiac electrical dysfunction and can guide subsequent treatment options.

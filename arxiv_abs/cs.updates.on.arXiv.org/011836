In the last decade, extended efforts have been poured into energy efficiency. Several energy consumption
datasets were henceforth published, with each dataset varying in properties, uses and limitations.
For instance, building energy consumption patterns are sourced from several sources, including
ambient conditions, user occupancy, weather conditions and consumer preferences. Thus, a proper
understanding of the available datasets will result in a strong basis for improving energy efficiency.
Starting from the necessity of a comprehensive review of existing databases, this work is proposed
to survey, study and visualize the numerical and methodological nature of building energy consumption
datasets. A total of thirty-one databases are examined and compared in terms of several features,
such as the geographical location, period of collection, number of monitored households, sampling
rate of collected data, number of sub-metered appliances, extracted features and release date.
Furthermore, data collection platforms and related modules for data transmission, data storage
and privacy concerns used in different datasets are also analyzed and compared. Based on the analytical
study, a novel dataset has been presented, namely Qatar university dataset, which is an annotated
power consumption anomaly detection dataset. The latter will be very useful for testing and training
anomaly detection algorithms, and hence reducing wasted energy. Moving forward, a set of recommendations
is derived to improve datasets collection, such as the adoption of multi-modal data collection,
smart Internet of things data collection, low-cost hardware platforms and privacy and security
mechanisms. In addition, future directions to improve datasets exploitation and utilization
are identified, including the use of novel machine learning solutions, innovative visualization
tools and explainable recommender systems.

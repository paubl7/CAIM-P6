In this paper, we propose an enhanced 3D myocardial strain estimation procedure, which combines
complementary displacement information from multiple orientations of a single imaging modality
(untagged CMR SSFP images). To estimate myocardial strain across the left ventricle, we register
the sets of short-axis, four-chamber and two-chamber views via a 2D non-rigid registration algorithm
implemented in a commercial software (Segment, Medviso). We then create a series of interpolating
functions for the three orthogonal directions of motion and use them to deform a tetrahedral mesh
representation of a patient-specific left ventricle. Additionally, we correct for overestimation
of displacement by introducing a weighting scheme that is based on displacement along the long axis.
The procedure was evaluated on the STACOM 2011 dataset containing CMR SSFP images for 16 healthy
volunteers. We show increased accuracy in estimating the three strain components (radial, circumferential,
longitudinal) compared to reported results in the challenge, for the imaging modality of interest
(SSFP). Our peak strain estimates are also significantly closer to reported measurements from
studies of a larger cohort in the literature and our own ground truth measurements using Segment
Strain Analysis Module. Our proposed procedure provides a relatively fast and simple method to
improve 2D tracking results, with the added flexibility in either deforming a reconstructed mesh
model from other image modalities or using the built-in CMR mesh reconstruction procedure. Our,
proposed scheme presents a deforming patient-specific model of the left ventricle, using the commonest
imaging modality , routinely administered in clinical settings, without requiring additional
or specialized imaging protocols.

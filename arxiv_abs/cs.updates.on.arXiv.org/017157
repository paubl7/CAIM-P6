Power grid operation subject to an extreme event requires decision-making by human operators under
stressful condition with high cognitive load. Decision support under adverse dynamic events,
specially if forecasted, can be supplemented by intelligent proactive control. Power system operation
during wildfires require resiliency-driven proactive control for load shedding, line switching
and resource allocation considering the dynamics of the wildfire and failure propagation. However,
possible number of line- and load-switching in a large system during an event make traditional prediction-driven
and stochastic approaches computationally intractable, leading operators to often use greedy
algorithms. We model and solve the proactive control problem as a Markov decision process and introduce
an integrated testbed for spatio-temporal wildfire propagation and proactive power-system operation.
We transform the enormous wildfire-propagation observation space and utilize it as part of a heuristic
for proactive de-energization of transmission assets. We integrate this heuristic with a reinforcement-learning
based proactive policy for controlling the generating assets. Our approach allows this controller
to provide setpoints for a part of the generation fleet, while a myopic operator can determine the
setpoints for the remaining set, which results in a symbiotic action. We evaluate our approach utilizing
the IEEE 24-node system mapped on a hypothetical terrain. Our results show that the proposed approach
can help the operator to reduce load loss during an extreme event, reduce power flow through lines
that are to be de-energized, and reduce the likelihood of infeasible power-flow solutions, which
would indicate violation of short-term thermal limits of transmission lines.

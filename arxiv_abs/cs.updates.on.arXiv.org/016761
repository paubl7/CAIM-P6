The thesis work presents assertion based functional verification of RTL representation of a digital
design. The MBIST controller is designed based on a memory testing March algorithm. This March algorithm
is a little modified March C algorithm which is modified by adding a paused element to test memory
data retention faults. In assertion based functional verification, creation of verification
plan, for MBIST controller RTL model and the implementation & simulation of the verification plan
using System-Verilog and Synopsys-VCS are done. In ABV, verification plan includes the MBIST controller
design and functional specification, functional coverage goals, code coverage goals, and assertions.
Assertions are used to check the errors in RTL model of MBIST controller and to provide the functionality
coverage. Functional coverage metrics are used to track the level or quality of verification. Most
of the functional metrics score approximately reached the planned goal of 100 % which is planned
in the verification plan. The designed MBIST controller is verified against the intended features.
ABV approach helped to make the verification and design process efficient and less time-consuming
by finding the bugs, exercising the corner cases in the design, and using the directed test cases
in a small design. ABV helped to write directed and efficient test cases (25) which are approx 32 %
less than the use of maximum possible random test cases (88) for designed MBIST controller with 100%
assertion coverage and approximately equal total functional coverage, i.e., 97 % approx. In this
way, ABV helped to fasten the design and verification process with better quality and assurance
of correct functionality of MBIST controller after the integration in MBIST architecture.

Plot-based Graphic API recommendation (Plot2API) is an unstudied but meaningful issue, which
has several important applications in the context of software engineering and data visualization,
such as the plotting guidance of the beginner, graphic API correlation analysis, and code conversion
for plotting. Plot2API is a very challenging task, since each plot is often associated with multiple
APIs and the appearances of the graphics drawn by the same API can be extremely varied due to the different
settings of the parameters. Additionally, the samples of different APIs also suffer from extremely
imbalanced. Considering the lack of technologies in Plot2API, we present a novel deep multi-task
learning approach named Semantic Parsing Guided Neural Network (SPGNN) which translates the Plot2API
issue as a multi-label image classification and an image semantic parsing tasks for the solution.
In SPGNN, the recently advanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) named EfficientNet is employed
as the backbone network for API recommendation. Meanwhile, a semantic parsing module is complemented
to exploit the semantic relevant visual information in feature learning and eliminate the appearance-relevant
visual information which may confuse the visual-information-based API recommendation. Moreover,
the recent data augmentation technique named random erasing is also applied for alleviating the
imbalance of API categories. We collect plots with the graphic APIs used to drawn them from Stack
Overflow, and release three new Plot2API datasets corresponding to the graphic APIs of R and Python
programming languages for evaluating the effectiveness of Plot2API techniques. Extensive experimental
results not only demonstrate the superiority of our method over the recent deep learning baselines
but also show the practicability of our method in the recommendation of graphic APIs.

The problem of dispersion of mobile robots on a graph asks that $n$ robots initially placed arbitrarily
on the nodes of an $n$-node anonymous graph, autonomously move to reach a final configuration where
exactly each node has at most one robot on it. This problem is of significant interest due to its relationship
to other fundamental robot coordination problems, such as exploration, scattering, load balancing,
relocation of self-driving electric cars to recharge stations, etc. The robots have unique IDs,
typically in the range $[1,poly(n)]$ and limited memory, whereas the graph is anonymous, i.e.,
the nodes do not have identifiers. The objective is to simultaneously minimize two performance
metrics: (i) time to achieve dispersion and (ii) memory requirement at each robot. This problem
has been relatively well-studied when robots are non-faulty. In this paper, we introduce the notion
of Byzantine faults to this problem, i.e., we formalize the problem of dispersion in the presence
of up to $f$ Byzantine robots. We then study the problem on a ring while simultaneously optimizing
the time complexity of algorithms and the memory requirement per robot. Specifically, we design
deterministic algorithms that attempt to match the time lower bound ($\Omega(n)$ rounds) and memory
lower bound ($\Omega(\log n)$ bits per robot). Our main result is a deterministic algorithm that
is both time and memory optimal, i.e., $O(n)$ rounds and $O(\log n)$ bits of memory required per robot,
subject to certain constraints. We subsequently provide results that require less assumptions
but are either only time or memory optimal but not both. We also provide a primitive, utilized often,
that takes robots initially gathered at a node of the ring and disperses them in a time and memory optimal
manner without additional assumptions required.

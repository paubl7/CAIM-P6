The existing particle image velocimetry (PIV) do not consider the curvature effect of the non-straight
particle trajectory, because it seems to be impossible to obtain the curvature information from
a pair of particle images. As a result, the computed vector underestimates the real velocity due
to the straight-line approximation, that further causes a systematic error for the PIV instrument.
In this work, the particle curved trajectory between two recordings is firstly explained with the
streamline segment of a steady flow (diffeomorphic transformation) instead of a single vector,
and this idea is termed as diffeomorphic PIV. Specifically, a deformation field is introduced to
describe the particle displacement, i.e., we try to find the optimal velocity field, of which the
corresponding deformation vector field agrees with the particle displacement. Because the variation
of the deformation function can be approximated with the variation of the velocity function, the
diffeomorphic PIV can be implemented as iterative PIV. That says, the diffeomorphic PIV warps the
images with deformation vector field instead of the velocity, and keeps the rest as same as iterative
PIVs. Two diffeomorphic deformation schemes -- forward diffeomorphic deformation interrogation
(FDDI) and central diffeomorphic deformation interrogation (CDDI) -- are proposed. Tested on
synthetic images, the FDDI achieves significant accuracy improvement across different one-pass
displacement estimators (cross-correlation, optical flow, deep learning flow). Besides, the
results on three real PIV image pairs demonstrate the non-negligible curvature effect for CDI-based
PIV, and our FDDI provides larger velocity estimation (more accurate) in the fast curvy streamline
areas. The accuracy improvement of the combination of FDDI and accurate dense estimator means that
our diffeomorphic PIV paves a new way for complex flow measurement.

Online discussion platforms offer a forum to strengthen and propagate belief in misinformed conspiracy
theories. Yet, they also offer avenues for conspiracy theorists to express their doubts and experiences
of cognitive dissonance. Such expressions of dissonance may shed light on who abandons misguided
beliefs and under which circumstances. This paper characterizes self-disclosures of dissonance
about QAnon, a conspiracy theory initiated by a mysterious leader Q and popularized by their followers,
anons in conspiracy theory subreddits. To understand what dissonance and disbelief mean within
conspiracy communities, we first characterize their social imaginaries, a broad understanding
of how people collectively imagine their social existence. Focusing on 2K posts from two image boards,
4chan and 8chan, and 1.2 M comments and posts from 12 subreddits dedicated to QAnon, we adopt a mixed
methods approach to uncover the symbolic language representing the movement, expectations, practices,
heroes and foes of the QAnon community. We use these social imaginaries to create a computational
framework for distinguishing belief and dissonance from general discussion about QAnon. Further,
analyzing user engagement with QAnon conspiracy subreddits, we find that self-disclosures of
dissonance correlate with a significant decrease in user contributions and ultimately with their
departure from the community. We contribute a computational framework for identifying dissonance
self-disclosures and measuring the changes in user engagement surrounding dissonance. Our work
can provide insights into designing dissonance-based interventions that can potentially dissuade
conspiracists from online conspiracy discussion communities.

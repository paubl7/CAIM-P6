This is a paper in the intersection of time series analysis and complexity theory that presents new
results on permutation complexity in general and permutation entropy in particular. In this context,
permutation complexity refers to the characterization of time series by means of ordinal patterns
(permutations), entropic measures, decay rates of missing ordinal patterns, and more. Since the
inception of this \textquotedblleft ordinal\textquotedblright\ methodology, its practical
application to any type of scalar time series and real-valued processes have proven to be simple
and useful. However, the theoretical aspects have remained limited to noiseless deterministic
series and dynamical systems, the main obstacle being the super-exponential growth of visible
permutations with length when randomness (also in form of observational noise) is present in the
data. To overcome this difficulty, we take a new approach through complexity classes, which are
precisely defined by the growth of visible permutations with length, regardless of the deterministic
or noisy nature of the data. We consider three major classes: exponential, sub-factorial and factorial.
The next step is to adapt the concept of Z-entropy to each of those classes, which we call permutation
entropy because it coincides with the conventional permutation entropy on the exponential class.
Z-entropies are a family of group entropies, each of them extensive on a given complexity class.
The result is a unified approach to the ordinal analysis of deterministic and random processes,
from dynamical systems to white noise, with new concepts and tools. Numerical simulations show
that permutation entropy discriminates time series from all complexity classes.

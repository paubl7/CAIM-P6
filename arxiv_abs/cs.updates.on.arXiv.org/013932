Online social network has been one of the most important platforms for viral marketing. Most of existing
researches about diffusion of adoptions of new products on networks are about one diffusion. That
is, only one piece of information about the product is spread on the network. However, in fact, one
product may have multiple features and the information about different features may spread independently
in social network. When a user would like to purchase the product, he would consider all of the features
of the product comprehensively not just consider one. Based on this, we propose a novel problem,
multi-feature budgeted profit maximization (MBPM) problem, which first considers budgeted profit
maximization under multiple features propagation of one product. Given a social network with each
node having an activation cost and a profit, MBPM problem seeks for a seed set with expected cost no
more than the budget to make the total expected profit as large as possible. We consider MBPM problem
under the adaptive setting, where seeds are chosen iteratively and next seed is selected according
to current diffusion results. We study adaptive MBPM problem under two models, oracle model and
noise model. The oracle model assumes conditional expected marginal profit of any node could be
obtained in O(1) time and a (1-1/e) expected approximation policy is proposed. Under the noise model,
we estimate conditional expected marginal profit of a node by modifying the EPIC algorithm and propose
an efficient policy, which could return a (1-exp({\epsilon}-1)) expected approximation ratio.
Several experiments are conducted on six realistic datasets to compare our proposed policies with
their corresponding non-adaptive algorithms and some heuristic adaptive policies. Experimental
results show efficiencies and superiorities of our policies.

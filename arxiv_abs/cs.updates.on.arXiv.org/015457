Machine Learning (ML) techniques are becoming an invaluable support for network intrusion detection,
especially in revealing anomalous flows, which often hide cyber-threats. Typically, ML algorithms
are exploited to classify/recognize data traffic on the basis of statistical features such as inter-arrival
times, packets length distribution, mean number of flows, etc. Dealing with the vast diversity
and number of features that typically characterize data traffic is a hard problem. This results
in the following issues: i) the presence of so many features leads to lengthy training processes
(particularly when features are highly correlated), while prediction accuracy does not proportionally
improve; ii) some of the features may introduce bias during the classification process, particularly
those that have scarce relation with the data traffic to be classified. To this end, by reducing the
feature space and retaining only the most significant features, Feature Selection (FS) becomes
a crucial pre-processing step in network management and, specifically, for the purposes of network
intrusion detection. In this review paper, we complement other surveys in multiple ways: i) evaluating
more recent datasets (updated w.r.t. obsolete KDD 99) by means of a designed-from-scratch Python-based
procedure; ii) providing a synopsis of most credited FS approaches in the field of intrusion detection,
including Multi-Objective Evolutionary techniques; iii) assessing various experimental analyses
such as feature correlation, time complexity, and performance. Our comparisons offer useful guidelines
to network/security managers who are considering the incorporation of ML concepts into network
intrusion detection, where trade-offs between performance and resource consumption are crucial.

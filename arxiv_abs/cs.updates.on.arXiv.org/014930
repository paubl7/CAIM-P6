In this paper, we define the notion of rigidity for linear electrical multiports and for matroid
pairs. We show the parallel between the two and study the consequences of this parallel. We present
applications to testing, using purely matroidal methods, whether a connection of rigid multiports
yields a linear network with unique solution. We also indicate that rigidity can be regarded as the
closest notion to duality that can be hoped for, when the spaces correspond to different physical
constraints, such as topological and device characteristic. A multiport is an ordered pair $(\V^1_{AB},\A^2_{B}),$
where $\V^1_{AB}$ is the solution space on $A\uplus B$ of the Kirchhoff current and voltage equations
of the graph of the multiport and $\A^2_{B}\equivd \alpha_B+\V^2_B$ is the device characteristic
of the multiport, with $A$ corresponding to port voltages and currents and $B$ corresponding to
internal voltages and currents. The pair $\{\V^1_{AB},\alpha_B+\V^2_{B}\}$ is said to be rigid
iff it has a solution $(x_A,x_B)$ for every vector $\alpha_B$ and given a restriction $x_A$ of the
solution, $x_B$ is unique. A matroid $\M_S$ on $S,$ is a family of `independent' sets with the property
that maximal independent sets contained in any given subset of $S$ have the same cardinality. The
pair $\{\M^1_{AB},\M^2_{B}\}$ is said to be rigid iff the two matroids have disjoint bases which
cover $B.$ We show that the properties of rigid pairs of matroids closely parallel those of rigid
multiports. We use the methods developed in the paper to show that a multiport with independent and
controlled sources and positive or negative resistors, whose parameters can be taken to be algebraically
independent over $\Q,$ is rigid, if certain simple topological conditions are satisfied by the
device edges.

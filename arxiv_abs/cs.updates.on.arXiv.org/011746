Understanding the structure of minor-free metrics, namely shortest path metrics obtained over
a weighted graph excluding a fixed minor, has been an important research direction since the fundamental
work of Robertson and Seymour. A fundamental idea that helps both to understand the structural properties
of these metrics and lead to strong algorithmic results is to construct a "small-complexity" graph
that approximately preserves distances between pairs of points of the metric. We show the two following
structural results for minor-free metrics: 1. Construction of a light subset spanner. Given a subset
of vertices called terminals, and $\epsilon$, in polynomial time we construct a subgraph that preserves
all pairwise distances between terminals up to a multiplicative $1+\epsilon$ factor, of total
weight at most $O_{\epsilon}(1)$ times the weight of the minimal Steiner tree spanning the terminals.
2. Construction of a stochastic metric embedding into low treewidth graphs with expected additive
distortion $\epsilon D$. Namely, given a minor free graph $G=(V,E,w)$ of diameter $D$, and parameter
$\epsilon$, we construct a distribution $\mathcal{D}$ over dominating metric embeddings into
treewidth-$O_{\epsilon}(\log n)$ graphs such that the additive distortion is at most $\epsilon
D$. One of our important technical contributions is a novel framework that allows us to reduce \emph{both
problems} to problems on simpler graphs of bounded diameter. Our results have the following algorithmic
consequences: (1) the first efficient approximation scheme for subset TSP in minor-free metrics;
(2) the first approximation scheme for vehicle routing with bounded capacity in minor-free metrics;
(3) the first efficient approximation scheme for vehicle routing with bounded capacity on bounded
genus metrics.

Due to the lack of standardized 3D cephalometric analytic methodology, 2D cephalograms synthesized
from 3D cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) volumes are widely used for cephalometric analysis
in dental CBCT systems. However, compared with conventional X-ray film based cephalograms, such
synthetic cephalograms lack image contrast and resolution. In addition, the radiation dose during
the scan for 3D reconstruction causes potential health risks. In this work, we propose a sigmoid-based
intensity transform that uses the nonlinear optical property of X-ray films to increase image contrast
of synthetic cephalograms. To improve image resolution, super resolution deep learning techniques
are investigated. For low dose purpose, the pixel-to-pixel generative adversarial network (pix2pixGAN)
is proposed for 2D cephalogram synthesis directly from two CBCT projections. For landmark detection
in the synthetic cephalograms, an efficient automatic landmark detection method using the combination
of LeNet-5 and ResNet50 is proposed. Our experiments demonstrate the efficacy of pix2pixGAN in
2D cephalogram synthesis, achieving an average peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) value of 33.8
with reference to the cephalograms synthesized from 3D CBCT volumes. Pix2pixGAN also achieves
the best performance in super resolution, achieving an average PSNR value of 32.5 without the introduction
of checkerboard or jagging artifacts. Our proposed automatic landmark detection method achieves
86.7% successful detection rate in the 2 mm clinical acceptable range on the ISBI Test1 data, which
is comparable to the state-of-the-art methods. The method trained on conventional cephalograms
can be directly applied to landmark detection in the synthetic cephalograms, achieving 93.0% and
80.7% successful detection rate in 4 mm precision range for synthetic cephalograms from 3D volumes
and 2D projections respectively.

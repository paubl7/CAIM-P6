Originally, the decision and control of the lane change of the vehicle were on the human driver. In
previous studies, the decision-making of lane-changing of the human drivers was mainly used to
increase the individual's benefit. However, the lane-changing behavior of these human drivers
can sometimes have a bad influence on the overall traffic flow. As technology for autonomous vehicles
develop, lane changing action as well as lane changing decision making fall within the control category
of autonomous vehicles. However, since many of the current lane-changing decision algorithms
of autonomous vehicles are based on the human driver model, it is hard to know the potential traffic
impact of such lane change. Therefore, in this study, we focused on the decision-making of lane change
considering traffic flow, and accordingly, we study the lane change control system considering
the whole traffic flow. In this research, the lane change control system predicts the future traffic
situation through the cell transition model, one of the most popular macroscopic traffic simulation
models, and determines the change probability of each lane that minimizes the total time delay through
the genetic algorithm. The lane change control system then conveys the change probability to this
vehicle. In the macroscopic simulation result, the proposed control system reduced the overall
travel time delay. The proposed system is applied to microscopic traffic simulation, the oversaturated
freeway traffic flow algorithm (OFFA), to evaluate the potential performance when it is applied
to the actual traffic system. In the traffic flow-density, the maximum traffic flow has been shown
to be increased, and the points in the congestion area have also been greatly reduced. Overall, the
time required for individual vehicles was reduced.

This paper presents a generic motion model to capture mobile robots' dynamic behaviors (translation
and rotation). The model is based on statistical models driven by white random processes and is formulated
into a full state estimation algorithm based on the error-state extended Kalman filtering framework
(ESEKF). Major benefits of this method are its versatility, being applicable to different robotic
systems without accurately modeling the robots' specific dynamics, and ability to estimate the
robot's (angular) acceleration, jerk, or higher-order dynamic states with low delay. Mathematical
analysis with numerical simulations are presented to show the properties of the statistical model-based
estimation framework and to reveal its connection to existing low-pass filters. Furthermore,
a new paradigm is developed for robots observability analysis by developing Lie derivatives and
associated partial differentiation directly on manifolds. It is shown that this new paradigm is
much simpler and more natural than existing methods based on quaternion parameterizations. It
is also scalable to high dimensional systems. A novel \textbf{\textit{thin}} set concept is introduced
to characterize the unobservable subset of the system states, providing the theoretical foundation
to observability analysis of robotic systems operating on manifolds and in high dimension. Finally,
extensive experiments including full state estimation and extrinsic calibration (both POS-IMU
and IMU-IMU) on a quadrotor UAV, a handheld platform and a ground vehicle are conducted. Comparisons
with existing methods show that the proposed method can effectively estimate all extrinsic parameters,
the robot's translation/angular acceleration and other state variables (e.g., position, velocity,
attitude) of high accuracy and low delay.

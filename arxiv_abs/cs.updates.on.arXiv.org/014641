Introduction: Computational modeling has rapidly advanced over the last decades, especially
to predict molecular properties for chemistry, material science and drug design. Recently, machine
learning techniques have emerged as a powerful and cost-effective strategy to learn from existing
datasets and perform predictions on unseen molecules. Accordingly, the explosive rise of data-driven
techniques raises an important question: What confidence can be assigned to molecular property
predictions and what techniques can be used for that purpose? Areas covered: In this work, we discuss
popular strategies for predicting molecular properties relevant to drug design, their corresponding
uncertainty sources and methods to quantify uncertainty and confidence. First, our considerations
for assessing confidence begin with dataset bias and size, data-driven property prediction and
feature design. Next, we discuss property simulation via molecular docking, and free-energy simulations
of binding affinity in detail. Lastly, we investigate how these uncertainties propagate to generative
models, as they are usually coupled with property predictors. Expert opinion: Computational techniques
are paramount to reduce the prohibitive cost and timing of brute-force experimentation when exploring
the enormous chemical space. We believe that assessing uncertainty in property prediction models
is essential whenever closed-loop drug design campaigns relying on high-throughput virtual screening
are deployed. Accordingly, considering sources of uncertainty leads to better-informed experimental
validations, more reliable predictions and to more realistic expectations of the entire workflow.
Overall, this increases confidence in the predictions and designs and, ultimately, accelerates
drug design.

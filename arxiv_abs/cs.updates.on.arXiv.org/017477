Onion routing is the most widely used approach to anonymous communication online. The idea is that
Alice wraps her message to Bob in layers of encryption to form an "onion," and routes it through a series
of intermediaries. Each intermediary's job is to decrypt ("peel") the onion it receives to obtain
instructions for where to send it next, and what to send. The intuition is that, by the time it gets
to Bob, the onion will have mixed with so many other onions, that its origin will be hard to trace even
for an adversary that observes the entire network and controls a fraction of the participants, possibly
including Bob. In spite of its widespread use in practice, until now no onion routing protocol was
known that simultaneously achieved, in the presence of an active adversary that observes all network
traffic and controls a constant fraction of the participants, (a) fault-tolerance, where even
if a few of the onions are dropped, the protocol still delivers the rest; (b) reasonable communication
and computational complexity as a function of the security parameter and the number of participants;
and (c) anonymity. In this paper, we give the first onion routing protocol that meets these goals:
our protocol (a) tolerates a polylogarithmic (in the security parameter) number of dropped onions
and still delivers the rest; (b) requires a polylogarithmic number of rounds and a polylogarithmic
number of onions sent per participant per round; and (c) achieves anonymity. We also show that to
achieve anonymity in a fault-tolerant fashion via onion routing, this number of onions and rounds
is necessary. Of independent interest, our analysis introduces two new security properties of
onion routing -- mixing and equalizing -- and we show that together they imply anonymity.

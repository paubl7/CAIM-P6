Predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) via reliable computational methods is an effective
and efficient way to mitigate the enormous costs and time of the drug discovery process. Structure-based
drug similarities and sequence-based target protein similarities are the commonly used information
for DTI prediction. Among numerous computational methods, neighborhood-based chemogenomic
approaches that leverage drug and target similarities to perform predictions directly are simple
but promising ones. However, most existing similarity-based methods follow the transductive
setting. These methods cannot directly generalize to unseen data because they should be re-built
to predict the interactions for new arriving drugs, targets, or drug-target pairs. Besides, many
similarity-based methods, especially neighborhood-based ones, cannot handle directly all three
types of interaction prediction. Furthermore, a large amount of missing interactions in current
DTI datasets hinders most DTI prediction methods. To address these issues, we propose a new method
denoted as Weighted k Nearest Neighbor with Interaction Recovery (WkNNIR). Not only can WkNNIR
estimate interactions of any new drugs and/or new targets without any need of re-training, but it
can also recover missing interactions. In addition, WkNNIR exploits local imbalance to promote
the influence of more reliable similarities on the DTI prediction process. We also propose a series
of ensemble methods that employ diverse sampling strategies and could be coupled with WkNNIR as
well as any other DTI prediction method to improve performance. Experimental results over four
benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approaches in predicting drug-target
interactions. Lastly, we confirm the practical prediction ability of proposed methods to discover
reliable interactions that not reported in the original benchmark datasets.

The constant increase in the amount and complexity of information obtained from IT data networkelements,
for its correct monitoring and management, is a reality. The same happens to data net-works in electrical
systems that provide effective supervision and control of substations and hydro-electric plants.
Contributing to this fact is the growing number of installations and new environmentsmonitored
by such data networks and the constant evolution of the technologies involved. This sit-uation
potentially leads to incomplete and/or contradictory data, issues that must be addressed inorder
to maintain a good level of monitoring and, consequently, management of these systems. Inthis paper,
a prototype of an expert system is developed to monitor the status of equipment of datanetworks in
electrical systems, which deals with inconsistencies without trivialising the inferences.This
is accomplished in the context of the remote control of hydroelectric plants and substationsby
a Regional Operation Centre (ROC). The expert system is developed with algorithms definedupon
a combination of Fuzzy logic and Paraconsistent Annotated Logic with Annotation of TwoValues (PAL2v)
in order to analyse uncertain signals and generate the operating conditions (faulty,normal, unstable
or inconsistent / indeterminate) of the equipment that are identified as importantfor the remote
control of hydroelectric plants and substations. A prototype of this expert systemwas installed
on a virtualised server with CLP500 software (from the EFACEC manufacturer) thatwas applied to
investigate scenarios consisting of a Regional (Brazilian) Operation Centre, with aGeneric Substation
and a Generic Hydroelectric Plant, representing a remote control environment.

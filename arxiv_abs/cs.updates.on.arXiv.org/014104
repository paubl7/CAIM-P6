Internet traffic recognition is an essential tool for access providers since recognizing traffic
categories related to different data packets transmitted on a network help them define adapted
priorities. That means, for instance, high priority requirements for an audio conference and low
ones for a file transfer, to enhance user experience. As internet traffic becomes increasingly
encrypted, the mainstream classic traffic recognition technique, payload inspection, is rendered
ineffective. This paper uses machine learning techniques for encrypted traffic classification,
looking only at packet size and time of arrival. Spiking neural networks (SNN), largely inspired
by how biological neurons operate, were used for two reasons. Firstly, they are able to recognize
time-related data packet features. Secondly, they can be implemented efficiently on neuromorphic
hardware with a low energy footprint. Here we used a very simple feedforward SNN, with only one fully-connected
hidden layer, and trained in a supervised manner using the newly introduced method known as Surrogate
Gradient Learning. Surprisingly, such a simple SNN reached an accuracy of 95.9% on ISCX datasets,
outperforming previous approaches. Besides better accuracy, there is also a very significant
improvement on simplicity: input size, number of neurons, trainable parameters are all reduced
by one to four orders of magnitude. Next, we analyzed the reasons for this good accuracy. It turns
out that, beyond spatial (i.e. packet size) features, the SNN also exploits temporal ones, mostly
the nearly synchronous (within a 200ms range) arrival times of packets with certain sizes. Taken
together, these results show that SNNs are an excellent fit for encrypted internet traffic classification:
they can be more accurate than conventional artificial neural networks (ANN), and they could be
implemented efficiently on low power embedded systems.

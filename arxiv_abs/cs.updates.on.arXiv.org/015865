In this work, we determine the full expression of the local truncation error of hyperbolic partial
differential equations (PDEs) on a uniform mesh. If we are employing a stable numerical scheme and
the global solution error is of the same order of accuracy as the global truncation error, we make
the following observations in the asymptotic regime, where the truncation error is dominated by
the powers of $\Delta x$ and $\Delta t$ rather than their coefficients. Assuming that we reach the
asymptotic regime before the machine precision error takes over, (a) the order of convergence of
stable numerical solutions of hyperbolic PDEs at constant ratio of $\Delta t$ to $\Delta x$ is governed
by the minimum of the orders of the spatial and temporal discretizations, and (b) convergence cannot
even be guaranteed under only spatial or temporal refinement. We have tested our theory against
numerical methods employing Method of Lines and not against ones that treat space and time together,
and we have not taken into consideration the reduction in the spatial and temporal orders of accuracy
resulting from slope-limiting monotonicity-preserving strategies commonly applied to finite
volume methods. Otherwise, our theory applies to any hyperbolic PDE, be it linear or non-linear,
and employing finite difference, finite volume, or finite element discretization in space, and
advanced in time with a predictor-corrector, multistep, or a deferred correction method. If the
PDE is reduced to an ordinary differential equation (ODE) by specifying the spatial gradients of
the dependent variable and the coefficients and the source terms to be zero, then the standard local
truncation error of the ODE is recovered. We perform the analysis with generic and specific hyperbolic
PDEs using the symbolic algebra package SymPy, and conduct a number of numerical experiments to
demonstrate our theoretical findings.

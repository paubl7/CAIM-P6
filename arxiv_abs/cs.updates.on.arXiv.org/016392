We study a quantum network that distributes entangled quantum states to multiple sets of users that
are connected to the network. Each user is connected to a switch of the network via a link. All the links
of the network generate bipartite Bell-state entangled states in each time-slot with certain probabilities,
and each end node stores one qubit of the entanglement generated by the link. To create shared entanglements
for a set of users, measurement operations are performed on qubits of link-level entanglements
on a set of related links, and these operations are probabilistic in nature and are successful with
certain probabilities. Requests arrive to the system seeking shared entanglements for different
sets of users. Each request is for the creation of shared entanglements for a fixed set of users using
link-level entanglements on a fixed set of links. Requests are processed according to First-Come-First-Served
service discipline and unserved requests are stored in buffers. Once a request is selected for service,
measurement operations are performed on qubits of link-level entanglements on related links to
create a shared entanglement. For given set of request arrival rates and link-level entanglement
generation rates, we obtain necessary conditions for the stability of queues of requests. In each
time-slot, the scheduler has to schedule entanglement swapping operations for different sets
of users to stabilize the network. Next, we propose a Max-Weight scheduling policy and show that
this policy stabilizes the network for all feasible arrival rates. We also provide numerical results
to support our analysis. The analysis of a single quantum switch that creates multipartite entanglements
for different sets of users is a special case of our work.

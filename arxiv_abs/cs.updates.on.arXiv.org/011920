New security and privacy concerns arise due to the growing popularity of voice assistant (VA) deployments
in home and enterprise networks. A number of past research results have demonstrated how malicious
actors can use hidden commands to get VAs to perform certain operations even when a person may be in
their vicinity. However, such work has not explored how compromised computers that are close to
VAs can leverage the phone channel to exfiltrate data with the help of VAs. After characterizing
the communication channel that is set up by commanding a VA to make a call to a phone number, we demonstrate
how malware can encode data into audio and send it via the phone channel. Such an attack, which can
be crafted remotely, at scale and at low cost, can be used to bypass network defenses that may be deployed
against leakage of sensitive data. We use Dual-Tone Multi-Frequency tones to encode arbitrary
binary data into audio that can be played over computer speakers and sent through a VA mediated phone
channel to a remote system. We show that modest amounts of data can be transmitted with high accuracy
with a short phone call lasting a few minutes. This can be done while making the audio nearly inaudible
for most people by modulating it with a carrier with frequencies that are near the higher end of the
human hearing range. Several factors influence the data transfer rate, including the distance
between the computer and the VA, the ambient noise that may be present and the frequency of modulating
carrier. With the help of a prototype built by us, we experimentally assess the impact of these factors
on data transfer rates and transmission accuracy. Our results show that voice assistants in the
vicinity of computers can pose new threats to data stored on such computers. These threats are not
addressed by traditional host and network defenses. We briefly discuss possible mitigation ways.

The paper presents the case study of BERLIN_LOKAL_ZEIT, a collaborative archive and exhibition
project aiming to document and reflect individual experiences of the COVID-19 lockdowns in Berlin,
Germany. What began as an observational effort in spring 2020became a year-long archive, exhibition,
and broadcasting platform that generated various hyper-local interfaces. The paper articulates
an improvisational approach to media architecture in the form of self-reflection by the project
initiators. Necessitated by the limitations imposed by the lockdowns on cultural production and
public discourse, the paper presents an alternative conceptual approach to media architecture
that is not based on a fully-specified technological infrastructure for discourse and interaction
but instead on improvisational practices that manifest themselves in different technical interfaces.
This improvisational approach is not merely a mode of production, but raises questions of about
the discourse of media architecture and its underlying assumptions of methodological rigor. In
traditional HCI, systems and artifacts are often presented as stable and fully specified, while
their users are considered interchangeable. In contrast, we consider urban media interfaces as
improvisation-driven infrastructures (or improstructures) in which the actors and their relationships
are stable, while the technologies they create are provisional and in flux. As a consequence, the
defining property of media architecture is no longer the structural integration of media into architecture
but the embodiment of mediated communication in objects and performances at concrete places. In
an environment where many physical spaces are longer accessible and human contact among strangers
diminished, the project explores the restorative function and capacities of media architecture
for shared reflection and discourse in physical public space.

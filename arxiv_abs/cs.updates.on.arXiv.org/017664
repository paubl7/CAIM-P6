Greater direct electrification of end-use sectors with a higher share of renewables is one of the
pillars to power a carbon-neutral society by 2050. However, in contrast to conventional power plants,
renewable energy is subject to uncertainty raising challenges for their interaction with power
systems. Scenario-based probabilistic forecasting models have become an important tool to equip
decision-makers. This paper proposes to present to the power systems forecasting practitioners
a recent deep learning technique, the normalizing flows, to produce accurate scenario-based probabilistic
forecasts that are crucial to face the new challenges in power systems applications. The strength
of this technique is to directly learn the stochastic multivariate distribution of the underlying
process by maximizing the likelihood. Through comprehensive empirical evaluations using the
open data of the Global Energy Forecasting Competition 2014, we demonstrate that this methodology
is competitive with other state-of-the-art deep learning generative models: generative adversarial
networks and variational autoencoders. The models producing weather-based wind, solar power,
and load scenarios are properly compared both in terms of forecast value, by considering the case
study of an energy retailer, and quality using several complementary metrics. The numerical experiments
are simple and easily reproducible. Thus, we hope it will encourage other forecasting practitioners
to test and use normalizing flows in power system applications such as bidding on electricity markets,
scheduling of power systems with high renewable energy sources penetration, energy management
of virtual power plan or microgrids, and unit commitment.

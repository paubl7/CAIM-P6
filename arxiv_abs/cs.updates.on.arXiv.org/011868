This thesis develops a conceptual framework considering social data as representing the surface
layer of a hierarchy of human social behaviours, needs and cognition which is employed to transform
social data into representations that preserve social behaviours and their causalities. Based
on this framework two platforms were built to capture insights from fast-paced and slow-paced social
data. For fast-paced, a self-structuring and incremental learning technique was developed to
automatically capture salient topics and corresponding dynamics over time. An event detection
technique was developed to automatically monitor those identified topic pathways for significant
fluctuations in social behaviours using multiple indicators such as volume and sentiment. This
platform is demonstrated using two large datasets with over 1 million tweets. The separated topic
pathways were representative of the key topics of each entity and coherent against topic coherence
measures. Identified events were validated against contemporary events reported in news. Secondly
for the slow-paced social data, a suite of new machine learning and natural language processing
techniques were developed to automatically capture self-disclosed information of the individuals
such as demographics, emotions and timeline of personal events. This platform was trialled on a
large text corpus of over 4 million posts collected from online support groups. This was further
extended to transform prostate cancer related online support group discussions into a multidimensional
representation and investigated the self-disclosed quality of life of patients (and partners)
against time, demographics and clinical factors. The capabilities of this extended platform have
been demonstrated using a text corpus collected from 10 prostate cancer online support groups comprising
of 609,960 prostate cancer discussions and 22,233 patients.

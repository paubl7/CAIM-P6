Visually-aware recommendation on E-commerce platforms aims to leverage visual information of
items to predict a user's preference. It is commonly observed that user's attention to visual features
does not always reflect the real preference. Although a user may click and view an item in light of
a visual satisfaction of their expectations, a real purchase does not always occur due to the unsatisfaction
of other essential features (e.g., brand, material, price). We refer to the reason for such a visually
related interaction deviating from the real preference as a visual bias. Existing visually-aware
models make use of the visual features as a separate collaborative signal similarly to other features
to directly predict the user's preference without considering a potential bias, which gives rise
to a visually biased recommendation. In this paper, we derive a causal graph to identify and analyze
the visual bias of these existing methods. In this causal graph, the visual feature of an item acts
as a mediator, which could introduce a spurious relationship between the user and the item. To eliminate
this spurious relationship that misleads the prediction of the user's real preference, an intervention
and a counterfactual inference are developed over the mediator. Particularly, the Total Indirect
Effect is applied for a debiased prediction during the testing phase of the model. This causal inference
framework is model agnostic such that it can be integrated into the existing methods. Furthermore,
we propose a debiased visually-aware recommender system, denoted as CausalRec to effectively
retain the supportive significance of the visual information and remove the visual bias. Extensive
experiments are conducted on eight benchmark datasets, which shows the state-of-the-art performance
of CausalRec and the efficacy of debiasing.

Traditional learning-based approaches for run-time Hardware Trojan detection require complex
and expensive on-chip data acquisition frameworks and thus incur high area and power overhead.
To address these challenges, we propose to leverage the power correlation between the executing
instructions of a microprocessor to establish a machine learning-based run-time Hardware Trojan
(HT) detection framework, called MacLeR. To reduce the overhead of data acquisition, we propose
a single power-port current acquisition block using current sensors in time-division multiplexing,
which increases accuracy while incurring reduced area overhead. We have implemented a practical
solution by analyzing multiple HT benchmarks inserted in the RTL of a system-on-chip (SoC) consisting
of four LEON3 processors integrated with other IPs like vga_lcd, RSA, AES, Ethernet, and memory
controllers. Our experimental results show that compared to state-of-the-art HT detection techniques,
MacLeR achieves 10\% better HT detection accuracy (i.e., 96.256%) while incurring a 7x reduction
in area and power overhead (i.e., 0.025% of the area of the SoC and <0.07% of the power of the SoC). In
addition, we also analyze the impact of process variation and aging on the extracted power profiles
and the HT detection accuracy of MacLeR. Our analysis shows that variations in fine-grained power
profiles due to the HTs are significantly higher compared to the variations in fine-grained power
profiles caused by the process variations (PV) and aging effects. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates
that, on average, the HT detection accuracy drop in MacLeR is less than 1% and 9% when considering
only PV and PV with worst-case aging, respectively, which is ~10x less than in the case of the state-of-the-art
ML-based HT detection technique.

While deep learning has shown promise in improving the automated diagnosis of disease based on chest
X-rays, deep networks may exhibit undesirable behavior related to shortcuts. This paper studies
the case of spurious class skew in which patients with a particular attribute are spuriously more
likely to have the outcome of interest. For instance, clinical protocols might lead to a dataset
in which patients with pacemakers are disproportionately likely to have congestive heart failure.
This skew can lead to models that take shortcuts by heavily relying on the biased attribute. We explore
this problem across a number of attributes in the context of diagnosing the cause of acute hypoxemic
respiratory failure. Applied to chest X-rays, we show that i) deep nets can accurately identify
many patient attributes including sex (AUROC = 0.96) and age (AUROC >= 0.90), ii) they tend to exploit
correlations between such attributes and the outcome label when learning to predict a diagnosis,
leading to poor performance when such correlations do not hold in the test population (e.g., everyone
in the test set is male), and iii) a simple transfer learning approach is surprisingly effective
at preventing the shortcut and promoting good generalization performance. On the task of diagnosing
congestive heart failure based on a set of chest X-rays skewed towards older patients (age >= 63),
the proposed approach improves generalization over standard training from 0.66 (95% CI: 0.54-0.77)
to 0.84 (95% CI: 0.73-0.92) AUROC. While simple, the proposed approach has the potential to improve
the performance of models across populations by encouraging reliance on clinically relevant manifestations
of disease, i.e., those that a clinician would use to make a diagnosis.

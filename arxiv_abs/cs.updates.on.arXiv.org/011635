Transcription, annotation, digitization and/or visualization are common transformations that
historical documents such as national records, birth/death registers, university records, letters
or books undergo. Reasons for those transformations span from the (physical) protection of the
original materials to disclosure of 'hidden' information or patterns within the documents. Even
though such transformations bring new insights and perspectives on the documents, they also modify
the documents' content, structure, and/or artifactual form and thus, occlude prior knowledge
and interpretation. When it comes to visualization as a means to transform historical documents
from written to abstract visual form, there is typically little acknowledgment or even understanding
of the previous transformation steps these documents have gone through. The 'tremendous rhetorical
force' of visualization, we argue, should not be at the expense of the multiple pasts, contexts,
and curators that are inherent in historical record collections. Rather, the urgent question for
the fields of visualization and the (digital) humanities is how to better support awareness of these
multiple layers of interpretation and the people behind them when representing historical documents.
We begin to address this question based on a collection of historical university records by (a) investigating
common transformation processes of historical documents, and (b) discussing opportunities and
challenges for making such transformations transparent through what we call 'provenance-driven
visualization'; the idea for a visualization that makes visible the layers of transformation (including
interpretation, re-structuring, and curation) inherent in historical documents.

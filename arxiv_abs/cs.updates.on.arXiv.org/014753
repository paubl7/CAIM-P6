Caching high-frequency reuse contents at the edge servers in the mobile edge computing (MEC) network
omits the part of backhaul transmission and further releases the pressure of data traffic. However,
how to efficiently decide the caching contents for edge servers is still an open problem, which refers
to the cache capacity of edge servers, the popularity of each content, and the wireless channel quality
during transmission. In this paper, we discuss the influence of unknown user density and popularity
of content on the cache placement solution at the edge server. Specifically, towards the implementation
of the cache placement solution in the practical network, there are two problems needing to be solved.
First, the estimation of unknown users' preference needs a huge amount of records of users' previous
requests. Second, the overlapping serving regions among edge servers cause the wrong estimation
of users' preference, which hinders the individual decision of caching placement. To address the
first issue, we propose a learning-based solution to adaptively optimize the cache placement policy.
We develop the extended multi-armed bandit (Extended MAB), which combines the generalized global
bandit (GGB) and Standard Multi-armed bandit (MAB). For the second problem, a multi-agent Extended
MAB-based solution is presented to avoid the mis-estimation of parameters and achieve the decentralized
cache placement policy. The proposed solution determines the primary time slot and secondary time
slot for each edge server. The proposed strategies are proven to achieve the bounded regret according
to the mathematical analysis. Extensive simulations verify the optimality of the proposed strategies
when comparing with baselines.

Structural balance theory describes stable configurations of topologies of signed interpersonal
appraisal networks. Existing models explaining the convergence of appraisal networks to structural
balance either diverge in finite time, or could get stuck in jammed states, or converge to only complete
graphs. In this paper, we study the open problem how steady non-all-to-all structural balance emerges
via local dynamics of interpersonal appraisals. We first compare two well-justified definitions
of structural balance for general non-all-to-all graphs, i.e., the triad-wise structural balance
and the two-faction structural balance, and thoroughly study their relations. Secondly, based
on three widely adopted sociological mechanisms: the symmetry mechanism, the influence mechanism,
and the homophily mechanism, we propose two simple models of gossip-like appraisal dynamics, the
symmetry-influence-homophily (SIH) dynamics and the symmetry-influence-opinion-homophily
(SIOH) dynamics. In these models, the appraisal network starting from any initial condition almost
surely achieves non-all-to-all triad-wise and two-faction structural balance in finite time
respectively. Moreover, the SIOH dynamics capture the co-evolution of interpersonal appraisals
and individuals' opinions. Regarding the theoretical contributions, we show that the equilibrium
set of the SIH (SIOH resp.) dynamics corresponds to the set of all the possible triad-wise (two-faction
resp.) structural balance configurations of the appraisal networks. Moreover, we prove that,
for any initial condition, the appraisal networks in the SIH (SIOH resp.) dynamics almost surely
achieve triad-wise (two-faction resp.) structural balance in finite time. Numerical studies
of the SIH dynamics also imply some insightful take-home messages on whether multilateral relations
reduce or exacerbate conflicts.

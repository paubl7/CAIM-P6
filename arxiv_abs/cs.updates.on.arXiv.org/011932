Medical diagnostic image analysis (e.g., CT scan or X-Ray) using machine learning is expected to
be an efficient and accurate way to detect COVID-19 infections. However, sharing diagnostic images
across medical institutions is usually not allowed due to the concern of patients' privacy, which
causes the issue of insufficient datasets for training the image classification model. Federated
learning is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm which produces an unbiased
global model based on the received updates of local models trained by clients without exchanging
clients' local data. However, the default setting of federated learning introduces huge communication
cost of transferring model updates and can hardly ensure model performance when data heterogeneity
of clients heavily exists. To improve communication efficiency and model performance, in this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic fusion based federated learning approach for medical diagnostic
image analysis to detect COVID-19 infections. First, we present architecture for dynamic fusion
based federated learning systems to analyse medical diagnostic images. Second, we design a decision
making mechanism for clients to decides each round's participation based on the local model performance.
Third, we propose an aggregation scheduling method to dynamically select the participating clients
based on each participating client's training time. Fourth, we summarise a category of medical
diagnostic image datasets for COVID-19 detection, which can be used by the machine learning community
for image analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach is feasible and performs
better than the default setting of federated learning in terms of model performance, communication
efficiency and fault tolerance.

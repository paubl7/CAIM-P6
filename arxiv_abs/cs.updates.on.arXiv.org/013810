Applications of the Extended Reality (XR) spectrum, a superset of Mixed, Augmented and Virtual
Reality, are gaining prominence and can be employed in a variety of areas, such as virtual museums.
Examples can be found in the areas of education, cultural heritage, health/treatment, entertainment,
marketing, and more. The majority of computer graphics applications nowadays are used to operate
only in one of the above realities. The lack of applications across the XR spectrum is a real shortcoming.
There are many advantages resulting from this problem's solution. Firstly, releasing an application
across the XR spectrum could contribute in discovering its most suitable reality. Moreover, an
application could be more immersive within a particular reality, depending on its context. Furthermore,
its availability increases to a broader range of users. For instance, if an application is released
both in Virtual and Augmented Reality, it is accessible to users that may lack the possession of a
VR headset, but not of a mobile AR device. The question that arises at this point, would be "Is it possible
for a full s/w application stack to be converted across XR without sacrificing UI/UX in a semi-automatic
way?". It may be quite difficult, depending on the architecture and application implementation.
Most companies nowadays support only one reality, due to their lack of UI/UX software architecture
or resources to support the complete XR spectrum. In this work, we present an "automatic reality
transition" in the context of virtual museum applications. We propose a development framework,
which will automatically allow this XR transition. This framework transforms any XR project into
different realities such as Augmented or Virtual. It also reduces the development time while increasing
the XR availability of 3D applications, encouraging developers to release applications across
the XR spectrum.

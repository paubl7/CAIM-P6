Among fundamental problems in the context of distributed computing by autonomous mobile entities,
one of the most representative and well studied is {\sc Point Convergence}: given an arbitrary initial
configuration of identical entities, disposed in the Euclidean plane, move in such a way that, for
all $\eps>0$, a configuration in which the separation between all entities is at most $\eps$ is eventually
reached and maintained. The problem has been previously studied in a variety of settings, including
full visibility, exact measurements (like distances and angles), and synchronous activation
of entities. Our study concerns the minimal assumptions under which entities, moving asynchronously
with limited and unknown visibility range and subject to limited imprecision in measurements,
can be guaranteed to converge in this way. We present an algorithm that solves {\sc Point Convergence},
for entities in the plane, in such a setting, provided the degree of asynchrony is bounded: while
any one entity is active, any other entity can be activated at most $k$ times, for some arbitrarily
large but fixed $k$. This provides a strong positive answer to a decade old open question posed by
Katreniak. We also prove that in a comparable setting that permits unbounded asynchrony, {\sc Point
Convergence} in the plane is impossible, contingent on the natural assumption that algorithms
maintain the (visible) connectivity among entities present in the initial configuration. This
variant, that we call {\sc Cohesive Convergence}, serves to distinguish the power of bounded and
unbounded asynchrony in the control of autonomous mobile entities, settling at the same time a long-standing
question whether in the Euclidean plane synchronously scheduled entities are more powerful than
asynchronously scheduled entities.

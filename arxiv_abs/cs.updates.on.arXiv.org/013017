The application of Internet of Things (IoT) and Machine Learning (ML) to the agricultural industry
has enabled the development and creation of smart farms and precision agriculture. The growth in
the number of smart farms and potential cooperation between these farms has given rise to the Cooperative
Smart Farming (CSF) where different connected farms collaborate with each other and share data
for their mutual benefit. This data sharing through CSF has various advantages where individual
data from separate farms can be aggregated by ML models and be used to produce actionable outputs
which then can be utilized by all the farms in CSFs. This enables farms to gain better insights for
enhancing desired outputs, such as crop yield, managing water resources and irrigation schedules,
as well as better seed applications. However, complications may arise in CSF when some of the farms
do not transfer high-quality data and rather rely on other farms to feed ML models. Another possibility
is the presence of rogue farms in CSFs that want to snoop on other farms without actually contributing
any data. In this paper, we analyze the behavior of farms participating in CSFs using game theory
approach, where each farm is motivated to maximize its profit. We first present the problem of defective
farms in CSFs due to lack of better data, and then propose a ML framework that segregates farms and
automatically assign them to an appropriate CSF cluster based on the quality of data they provide.
Our proposed model rewards the farms supplying better data and penalize the ones that do not provide
required data or are malicious in nature, thus, ensuring the model integrity and better performance
all over while solving the defective farms problem.

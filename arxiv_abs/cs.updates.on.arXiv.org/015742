The mobile data traffic has been exponentially growing during the last decades, which has been enabled
by the densification of the network infrastructure, in terms of increased cell density (i.e., ultra-dense
network (UDN)) and/or increased number of active antennas per access point (AP) (i.e., massive
multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO)). However, neither UDN nor mMIMO will meet the increasing
data rate demands of the sixth generation (6G) wireless communications due to the inter-cell interference
and large quality-of-service variations, respectively. Cell-free (CF) mMIMO, which combines
the best aspects of UDN with mMIMO, is viewed as a key solution to this issue. In such systems, each
user equipment (UE) is served by a preferred set of surrounding APs that cooperate to serve the UE
in a CF approach. In this paper, we provide a survey of the state-of-the-art literature on CF mMIMO
systems. As a starting point, we present the significance and challenges of improving the user-experienced
data rates which motivate CF mMIMO, derive the basic properties of CF mMIMO, and provide an introduction
to other technologies related to CF mMIMO. We then provide the canonical framework for CF mMIMO,
where the essential details (i.e., transmission procedure and mathematical system model) are
discussed. Next, we provide a deep look at the resource allocation and signal processing problems
related to CF mMIMO and survey the state-of-the-art schemes and algorithms. After that, we discuss
the practical issues when implementing CF mMIMO, including fronthaul limitations and hardware
impairment. Potential future directions of CF mMIMO research are then highlighted. We conclude
this paper with a summary of the key lessons learned in this field. The objective of this paper is to
provide a starting point for anyone who wants to conduct research on CF mMIMO for future wireless
networks.

Fiber tractography is an important tool of computational neuroscience that enables reconstructing
the spatial connectivity and organization of white matter of the brain. Fiber tractography takes
advantage of diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging (dMRI) which allows measuring the apparent
diffusivity of cerebral water along different spatial directions. Unfortunately, collecting
such data comes at the price of reduced spatial resolution and substantially elevated acquisition
times, which limits the clinical applicability of dMRI. This problem has been thus far addressed
using two principal strategies. Most of the efforts have been extended towards improving the quality
of signal estimation for any, yet fixed sampling scheme (defined through the choice of diffusion-encoding
gradients). On the other hand, optimization over the sampling scheme has also proven to be effective.
Inspired by the previous results, the present work consolidates the above strategies into a unified
estimation framework, in which the optimization is carried out with respect to both estimation
model and sampling design {\it concurrently}. The proposed solution offers substantial improvements
in the quality of signal estimation as well as the accuracy of ensuing analysis by means of fiber tractography.
While proving the optimality of the learned estimation models would probably need more extensive
evaluation, we nevertheless claim that the learned sampling schemes can be of immediate use, offering
a way to improve the dMRI analysis without the necessity of deploying the neural network used for
their estimation. We present a comprehensive comparative analysis based on the Human Connectome
Project data. Code and learned sampling designs aviliable at https://github.com/tomer196/Learned_dMRI.

Polyps in the colon are widely known as cancer precursors identified by colonoscopy either related
to diagnostic work-up for symptoms, colorectal cancer screening or systematic surveillance of
certain diseases. Whilst most polyps are benign, the number, size and the surface structure of the
polyp are tightly linked to the risk of colon cancer. There exists a high missed detection rate and
incomplete removal of colon polyps due to the variable nature, difficulties to delineate the abnormality,
high recurrence rates and the anatomical topography of the colon. In the past, several methods have
been built to automate polyp detection and segmentation. However, the key issue of most methods
is that they have not been tested rigorously on a large multi-center purpose-built dataset. Thus,
these methods may not generalise to different population datasets as they overfit to a specific
population and endoscopic surveillance. To this extent, we have curated a dataset from 6 different
centers incorporating more than 300 patients. The dataset includes both single frame and sequence
data with 3446 annotated polyp labels with precise delineation of polyp boundaries verified by
six senior gastroenterologists. To our knowledge, this is the most comprehensive detection and
pixel-level segmentation dataset curated by a team of computational scientists and expert gastroenterologists.
This dataset has been originated as the part of the Endocv2021 challenge aimed at addressing generalisability
in polyp detection and segmentation. In this paper, we provide comprehensive insight into data
construction and annotation strategies, annotation quality assurance and technical validation
for our extended EndoCV2021 dataset which we refer to as PolypGen.

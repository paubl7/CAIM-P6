The simple gesture of pointing can greatly augment ones ability to comprehend states of the world
based on observations. It triggers additional inferences relevant to ones task at hand. We model
an agents update to its belief of the world based on individual observations using a partially observable
Markov decision process (POMDP), a mainstream artificial intelligence (AI) model of how to act
rationally according to beliefs formed through observation. On top of that, we model pointing as
a communicative act between agents who have a mutual understanding that the pointed observation
must be relevant and interpretable. Our model measures relevance by defining a Smithian Value of
Information (SVI) as the utility improvement of the POMDP agent before and after receiving the pointing.
We model that agents calculate SVI by using the cognitive theory of Smithian helping as a principle
of coordinating separate beliefs for action prediction and action evaluation. We then import SVI
into rational speech act (RSA) as the utility function of an utterance. These lead us to a pragmatic
model of pointing allowing for contextually flexible interpretations. We demonstrate the power
of our Smithian pointing model by extending the Wumpus world, a classic AI task where a hunter hunts
a monster with only partial observability of the world. We add another agent as a guide who can only
help by marking an observation already perceived by the hunter with a pointing or not, without providing
new observations or offering any instrumental help. Our results show that this severely limited
and overloaded communication nevertheless significantly improves the hunters performance.
The advantage of pointing is indeed due to a computation of relevance based on Smithian helping,
as it disappears completely when the task is too difficult or too easy for the guide to help.

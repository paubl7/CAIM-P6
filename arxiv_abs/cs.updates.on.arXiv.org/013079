Providing appropriate structures around human resources can streamline operations and thus facilitate
the competitiveness of an organization. To achieve this goal, modern organizations need to acquire
an accurate and timely understanding of human resource grouping while faced with an ever-changing
environment. The use of process mining offers a promising way to help address the need through utilizing
event log data stored in information systems. By extracting knowledge about the actual behavior
of resources participating in business processes from event logs, organizational models can be
constructed, which facilitate the analysis of the de facto grouping of human resources relevant
to process execution. Nevertheless, open research gaps remain to be addressed when applying the
state-of-the-art process mining to analyze resource grouping. For one, the discovery of organizational
models has only limited connections with the context of process execution. For another, a rigorous
solution that evaluates organizational models against event log data is yet to be proposed. In this
paper, we aim to tackle these research challenges by developing a novel framework built upon a richer
definition of organizational models coupling resource grouping with process execution knowledge.
By introducing notions of conformance checking for organizational models, the framework allows
effective evaluation of organizational models, and therefore provides a foundation for analyzing
and improving resource grouping based on event logs. We demonstrate the feasibility of this framework
by proposing an approach underpinned by the framework for organizational model discovery, and
also conduct experiments on real-life event logs to discover and evaluate organizational models.

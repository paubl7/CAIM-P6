Memory disaggregation has attracted great attention recently because of its benefits in efficient
memory utilization and ease of management. So far, memory disaggregation research has all taken
one of two approaches, building/emulating memory nodes with either regular servers or raw memory
devices with no processing power. The former incurs higher monetary cost and face tail latency and
scalability limitations, while the latter introduce performance, security, and management problems.
Server-based memory nodes and memory nodes with no processing power are two extreme approaches.
We seek a sweet spot in the middle by proposing a hardware-based memory disaggregation solution
that has the right amount of processing power at memory nodes. Furthermore, we take a clean-slate
approach by starting from the requirements of memory disaggregation and designing a memory-disaggregation-native
system. We propose a hardware-based disaggregated memory system, Clio, that virtualizes and manages
disaggregated memory at the memory node. Clio includes a new hardware-based virtual memory system,
a customized network system, and a framework for computation offloading. In building Clio, we not
only co-design OS functionalities, hardware architecture, and the network system, but also co-design
the compute node and memory node. We prototyped Clio's memory node with FPGA and implemented its
client-node functionalities in a user-space library. Clio achieves 100 Gbps throughput and an
end-to-end latency of 2.5 us at median and 3.2 us at the 99th percentile. Clio scales much better and
has orders of magnitude lower tail latency than RDMA, and it has 1.1x to 3.4x energy saving compared
to CPU-based and SmartNIC-based disaggregated memory systems and is 2.7x faster than software-based
SmartNIC solutions.

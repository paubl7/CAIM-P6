The goal of text ranking is to generate an ordered list of texts retrieved from a corpus in response
to a query. Although the most common formulation of text ranking is search, instances of the task
can also be found in many natural language processing applications. This survey provides an overview
of text ranking with neural network architectures known as transformers, of which BERT is the best-known
example. The combination of transformers and self-supervised pretraining has been responsible
for a paradigm shift in natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR), and beyond.
In this survey, we provide a synthesis of existing work as a single point of entry for practitioners
who wish to gain a better understanding of how to apply transformers to text ranking problems and
researchers who wish to pursue work in this area. We cover a wide range of modern techniques, grouped
into two high-level categories: transformer models that perform reranking in multi-stage architectures
and dense retrieval techniques that perform ranking directly. There are two themes that pervade
our survey: techniques for handling long documents, beyond typical sentence-by-sentence processing
in NLP, and techniques for addressing the tradeoff between effectiveness (i.e., result quality)
and efficiency (e.g., query latency, model and index size). Although transformer architectures
and pretraining techniques are recent innovations, many aspects of how they are applied to text
ranking are relatively well understood and represent mature techniques. However, there remain
many open research questions, and thus in addition to laying out the foundations of pretrained transformers
for text ranking, this survey also attempts to prognosticate where the field is heading.

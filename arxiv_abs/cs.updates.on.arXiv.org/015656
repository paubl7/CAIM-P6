Recommending medications for patients using electronic health records (EHRs) is a crucial data
mining task for an intelligent healthcare system. It can assist doctors in making clinical decisions
more efficiently. However, the inherent complexity of the EHR data renders it as a challenging task:
(1) Multilevel structures: the EHR data typically contains multilevel structures which are closely
related with the decision-making pathways, e.g., laboratory results lead to disease diagnoses,
and then contribute to the prescribed medications; (2) Multiple sequences interactions: multiple
sequences in EHR data are usually closely correlated with each other; (3) Abundant noise: lots of
task-unrelated features or noise information within EHR data generally result in suboptimal performance.
To tackle the above challenges, we propose a multilevel selective and interactive network (MeSIN)
for medication recommendation. Specifically, MeSIN is designed with three components. First,
an attentional selective module (ASM) is applied to assign flexible attention scores to different
medical codes embeddings by their relevance to the recommended medications in every admission.
Second, we incorporate a novel interactive long-short term memory network (InLSTM) to reinforce
the interactions of multilevel medical sequences in EHR data with the help of the calibrated memory-augmented
cell and an enhanced input gate. Finally, we employ a global selective fusion module (GSFM) to infuse
the multi-sourced information embeddings into final patient representations for medications
recommendation. To validate our method, extensive experiments have been conducted on a real-world
clinical dataset. The results demonstrate a consistent superiority of our framework over several
baselines and testify the effectiveness of our proposed approach.

Cyberattacks can cause a severe impact on power systems unless detected early. However, accurate
and timely detection in critical infrastructure systems presents challenges, e.g., due to zero-day
vulnerability exploitations and the cyber-physical nature of the system coupled with the need
for high reliability and resilience of the physical system. Conventional rule-based and anomaly-based
intrusion detection system (IDS) tools are insufficient for detecting zero-day cyber intrusions
in the industrial control system (ICS) networks. Hence, in this work, we show that fusing information
from multiple data sources can help identify cyber-induced incidents and reduce false positives.
Specifically, we present how to recognize and address the barriers that can prevent the accurate
use of multiple data sources for fusion-based detection. We perform multi-source data fusion for
training IDS in a cyber-physical power system testbed where we collect cyber and physical side data
from multiple sensors emulating real-world data sources that would be found in a utility and synthesizes
these into features for algorithms to detect intrusions. Results are presented using the proposed
data fusion application to infer False Data and Command injection-based Man-in- The-Middle (MiTM)
attacks. Post collection, the data fusion application uses time-synchronized merge and extracts
features followed by pre-processing such as imputation and encoding before training supervised,
semi-supervised, and unsupervised learning models to evaluate the performance of the IDS. A major
finding is the improvement of detection accuracy by fusion of features from cyber, security, and
physical domains. Additionally, we observed the co-training technique performs at par with supervised
learning methods when fed with our features.

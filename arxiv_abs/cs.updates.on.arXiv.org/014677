This thesis proposes techniques aiming to make blockchain technologies and smart contract platforms
practical by improving their scalability, latency, and privacy. This thesis starts by presenting
the design and implementation of Chainspace, a distributed ledger that supports user defined smart
contracts and execute user-supplied transactions on their objects. The correct execution of smart
contract transactions is publicly verifiable. Chainspace is scalable by sharding state; it is
secure against subsets of nodes trying to compromise its integrity or availability properties
through Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT). This thesis also introduces a family of replay attacks
against sharded distributed ledgers targeting cross-shard consensus protocols; they allow an
attacker, with network access only, to double-spend resources with minimal efforts. We then build
Byzcuit, a new cross-shard consensus protocol that is immune to those attacks and that is tailored
to run at the heart of Chainspace. Next, we propose FastPay, a high-integrity settlement system
for pre-funded payments that can be used as a financial side-infrastructure for Chainspace to support
low-latency retail payments. This settlement system is based on Byzantine Consistent Broadcast
as its core primitive, foregoing the expenses of full atomic commit channels (consensus). The resulting
system has extremely low-latency for both confirmation and payment finality. Finally, this thesis
proposes Coconut, a selective disclosure credential scheme supporting distributed threshold
issuance, public and private attributes, re-randomization, and multiple unlinkable selective
attribute revelations. It ensures authenticity and availability even when a subset of credential
issuing authorities are malicious or offline, and natively integrates with Chainspace to enable
a number of scalable privacy-preserving applications.

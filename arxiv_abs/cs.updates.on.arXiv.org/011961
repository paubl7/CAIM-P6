While existing predictive frameworks are able to handle Euclidean structured data (i.e, brain
images), they might fail to generalize to geometric non-Euclidean data such as brain networks.
Besides, these are rooted the sample selection step in using Euclidean or learned similarity measure
between vectorized training and testing brain networks. Such sample connectomic representation
might include irrelevant and redundant features that could mislead the training sample selection
step. Undoubtedly, this fails to exploit and preserve the topology of the brain connectome. To overcome
this major drawback, we propose Residual Embedding Similarity-Based Network selection (RESNets)
for predicting brain network evolution trajectory from a single timepoint. RESNets first learns
a compact geometric embedding of each training and testing sample using adversarial connectome
embedding network. This nicely reduces the high-dimensionality of brain networks while preserving
their topological properties via graph convolutional networks. Next, to compute the similarity
between subjects, we introduce the concept of a connectional brain template (CBT), a fixed network
reference, where we further represent each training and testing network as a deviation from the
reference CBT in the embedding space. As such, we select the most similar training subjects to the
testing subject at baseline by comparing their learned residual embeddings with respect to the
pre-defined CBT. Once the best training samples are selected at baseline, we simply average their
corresponding brain networks at follow-up timepoints to predict the evolution trajectory of the
testing network. Our experiments on both healthy and disordered brain networks demonstrate the
success of our proposed method in comparison to RESNets ablated versions and traditional approaches.

We propose HERMES, a scalable, secure, and privacy-enhancing system for users to share and access
vehicles. HERMES securely outsources operations of vehicle access token generation to a set of
untrusted servers. It builds on an earlier proposal, namely SePCAR [1], and extends the system design
for improved efficiency and scalability. To cater to system and user needs for secure and private
computations, HERMES utilizes and combines several cryptographic primitives with secure multiparty
computation efficiently. It conceals secret keys of vehicles and transaction details from the
servers, including vehicle booking details, access token information, and user and vehicle identities.
It also provides user accountability in case of disputes. Besides, we provide semantic security
analysis and prove that HERMES meets its security and privacy requirements. Last but not least,
we demonstrate that HERMES is efficient and, in contrast to SePCAR, scales to a large number of users
and vehicles, making it practical for real-world deployments. We build our evaluations with two
different multiparty computation protocols: HtMAC-MiMC and CBC-MAC-AES. Our results demonstrate
that HERMES with HtMAC-MiMC requires only approx 1,83 ms for generating an access token for a single-vehicle
owner and approx 11,9 ms for a large branch of rental companies with over a thousand vehicles. It handles
546 and 84 access token generations per second, respectively. This results in HERMES being 696 (with
HtMAC-MiMC) and 42 (with CBC-MAC-AES) times faster compared to in SePCAR for a single-vehicle owner
access token generation. Furthermore, we show that HERMES is practical on the vehicle side, too,
as access token operations performed on a prototype vehicle on-board unit take only approx 62,087
ms.

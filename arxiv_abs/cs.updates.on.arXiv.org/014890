Speeding up testing and vaccination is essential to controlling the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
pandemic that has became a global health crisis. In this paper, we develop mathematical frameworks
for optimizing locations of distribution centers and plans for distributing resources such as
test kits and vaccines under spatiotemporal uncertainties of infection and demand trends. We aim
to balance between operational cost (including costs of deploying facilities, shipping and storage)
and quality of service (reflected by delivery speed and demand coverage), while ensuring equity
and fairness of resource distribution based on historical infection data and demographics of estimated
demand. Using weighted multiple objectives, we formulate a stochastic integer program and also
seek robust solutions against the distributional ambiguity of demand. For the latter, we propose
a distributionally robust optimization model using a moment ambiguity set, and derive monolithic
reformulations depending on specific forms of this set. We compare different approaches by solving
instances generated using real COVID-19 infection data for distributing vaccines and test kits
over the United States and the State of Michigan, respectively. We demonstrate results over distinct
phases of the pandemic to estimate cost and speed of resource distribution depending on the scales
and coverage. approaches always outperform the deterministic one. If we prioritize the worst-case
performance in terms of unmet demand (i.e., untested or unvaccinated people who qualify), then
the distributionally robust approach is preferred despite of its higher overall cost. Nevertheless,
the stochastic programming approach can provide an intermediate plan under budgetary restrictions
without significant compromises in demand coverage.

The individual brain can be viewed as a highly-complex multigraph (i.e. a set of graphs also called
connectomes), where each graph represents a unique connectional view of pairwise brain region
(node) relationships such as function or morphology. Due to its multifold complexity, understanding
how brain disorders alter not only a single view of the brain graph, but its multigraph representation
at the individual and population scales, remains one of the most challenging obstacles to profiling
brain connectivity for ultimately disentangling a wide spectrum of brain states (e.g., healthy
vs. disordered). In this work, while cross-pollinating the fields of spectral graph theory and
diffusion models, we unprecedentedly propose an eigen-based cross-diffusion strategy for multigraph
brain integration, comparison, and profiling. Specifically, we first devise a brain multigraph
fusion model guided by eigenvector centrality to rely on most central nodes in the cross-diffusion
process. Next, since the graph spectrum encodes its shape (or geometry) as if one can hear the shape
of the graph, for the first time, we profile the fused multigraphs at several diffusion timescales
by extracting the compact heat-trace signatures of their corresponding Laplacian matrices. Here,
we reveal for the first time autistic and healthy profiles of morphological brain multigraphs,
derived from T1-w magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and demonstrate their discriminability in
boosting the classification of unseen samples in comparison with state-of-the-art methods. This
study presents the first step towards hearing the shape of the brain multigraph that can be leveraged
for profiling and disentangling comorbid neurological disorders, thereby advancing precision
medicine.

In mobile edge computing (MEC), one of the important challenges is how much resources of which mobile
edge server (MES) should be allocated to which user equipment (UE). The existing resource allocation
schemes only consider CPU as the requested resource and assume utility for MESs as either a random
variable or dependent on the requested CPU only. This paper presents a novel comprehensive utility
function for resource allocation in MEC. The utility function considers the heterogeneous nature
of applications that a UE offloads to MES. The proposed utility function considers all important
parameters, including CPU, RAM, hard disk space, required time, and distance, to calculate a more
realistic utility value for MESs. Moreover, we improve upon some general algorithms, used for resource
allocation in MEC and cloud computing, by considering our proposed utility function. We name the
improved versions of these resource allocation schemes as comprehensive resource allocation
schemes. The UE requests are modeled to represent the amount of resources requested by the UE as well
as the time for which the UE has requested these resources. The utility function depends upon the
UE requests and the distance between UEs and MES, and serves as a realistic means of comparison between
different types of UE requests. Choosing (or selecting) an optimal MES with the optimal amount of
resources to be allocated to each UE request is a challenging task. We show that MES resource allocation
is sub-optimal if CPU is the only resource considered. By taking into account the other resources,
i.e., RAM, disk space, request time, and distance in the utility function, we demonstrate improvement
in the resource allocation algorithms in terms of service rate, utility, and MES energy consumption.

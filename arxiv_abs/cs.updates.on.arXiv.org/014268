This paper presents an empirical analysis of Steemit, a key representative of the emerging incentivized
social media platforms over Blockchains, to understand and evaluate the actual level of decentralization
and the practical effects of cryptocurrency-driven reward system in these modern social media
platforms. Similar to Bitcoin, Steemit is operated by a decentralized community, where 21 members
are periodically elected to cooperatively operate the platform through the Delegated Proof-of-Stake
(DPoS) consensus protocol. Our study performed on 539 million operations performed by 1.12 million
Steemit users during the period 2016/03 to 2018/08 reveals that the actual level of decentralization
in Steemit is far lower than the ideal level, indicating that the DPoS consensus protocol may not
be a desirable approach for establishing a highly decentralized social media platform. In Steemit,
users create contents as posts which get curated based on votes from other users. The platform periodically
issues cryptocurrency as rewards to creators and curators of popular posts. Although such a reward
system is originally driven by the desire to incentivize users to contribute to high-quality contents,
our analysis of the underlying cryptocurrency transfer network on the blockchain reveals that
more than 16% transfers of cryptocurrency in Steemit are sent to curators suspected to be bots and
also finds the existence of an underlying supply network for the bots, both suggesting a significant
misuse of the current reward system in Steemit. Our study is designed to provide insights on the current
state of this emerging blockchain-based social media platform including the effectiveness of
its design and the operation of the consensus protocols and the reward system.

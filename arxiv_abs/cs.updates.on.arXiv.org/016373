Next generation wireless networks are expected to be extremely complex due to their massive heterogeneity
in terms of the types of network architectures they incorporate, the types and numbers of smart IoT
devices they serve, and the types of emerging applications they support. In such large-scale and
heterogeneous networks (HetNets), radio resource allocation and management (RRAM) becomes one
of the major challenges encountered during system design and deployment. In this context, emerging
Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) techniques are expected to be one of the main enabling technologies
to address the RRAM in future wireless HetNets. In this paper, we conduct a systematic in-depth,
and comprehensive survey of the applications of DRL techniques in RRAM for next generation wireless
networks. Towards this, we first overview the existing traditional RRAM methods and identify their
limitations that motivate the use of DRL techniques in RRAM. Then, we provide a comprehensive review
of the most widely used DRL algorithms to address RRAM problems, including the value- and policy-based
algorithms. The advantages, limitations, and use-cases for each algorithm are provided. We then
conduct a comprehensive and in-depth literature review and classify existing related works based
on both the radio resources they are addressing and the type of wireless networks they are investigating.
To this end, we carefully identify the types of DRL algorithms utilized in each related work, the
elements of these algorithms, and the main findings of each related work. Finally, we highlight
important open challenges and provide insights into several future research directions in the
context of DRL-based RRAM. This survey is intentionally designed to guide and stimulate more research
endeavors towards building efficient and fine-grained DRL-based RRAM schemes for future wireless
networks.

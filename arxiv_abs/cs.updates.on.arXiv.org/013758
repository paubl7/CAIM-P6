The COVID pandemic and the measures which were taken had effect over the mental health of persons.
The current paper proposes a concept that supports the performance of students by analyzing three
ways of distance learning, namely text, text and illustrations, including charts, video. An electroencephalogram
headset allows the detection of brainwaves and the developed web application enhances the process
of distance learning. The electrodes of the headset are placed at contact with the user head and monitor
the activity of the left and right frontal regions, along with the temporal lobe. Mood, focus, stress,
relaxation, engagement, excitement and interest are triggered as numerical values by using the
headset. The users provide information about their daily activities, including learning and evaluation
processes. According to the study, users had the highest long term attention while using text and
illustrations, followed by watching videos. This is caused by the fact that the text contained the
code for the programs which were presented in the video. Also, the users feel comfortable while using
the application and they started to pay more attention to the connection between stress, health,
education and well being. The results triggered by the headset had higher values while students
studied for the first time using videos. When they wanted to remember the information, the text and
illustrations way of learning was the best option. Based on the study outcomes, the instructional
design can be enhanced. Moreover, the results improved as the students became more equilibrated
and confident in themselves. Teachers, professors and parents are able to collaborate and enhance
training. While studying online under lockdown, students have found the proposed solution to be
good because their inner state influences their productivity while solving problems.

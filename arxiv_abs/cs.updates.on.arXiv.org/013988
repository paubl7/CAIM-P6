Predictive processing has become an influential framework in cognitive sciences. This framework
turns the traditional view of perception upside down, claiming that the main flow of information
processing is realized in a top-down hierarchical manner. Furthermore, it aims at unifying perception,
cognition, and action as a single inferential process. However, in the related literature, the
predictive processing framework and its associated schemes such as predictive coding, active
inference, perceptual inference, free-energy principle, tend to be used interchangeably. In
the field of cognitive robotics there is no clear-cut distinction on which schemes have been implemented
and under which assumptions. In this paper, working definitions are set with the main aim of analyzing
the state of the art in cognitive robotics research working under the predictive processing framework
as well as some related non-robotic models. The analysis suggests that, first, both research in
cognitive robotics implementations and non-robotic models needs to be extended to the study of
how multiple exteroceptive modalities can be integrated into prediction error minimization schemes.
Second, a relevant distinction found here is that cognitive robotics implementations tend to emphasize
the learning of a generative model, while in non-robotics models it is almost absent. Third, despite
the relevance for active inference, few cognitive robotics implementations examine the issues
around control and whether it should result from the substitution of inverse models with proprioceptive
predictions. Finally, limited attention has been placed on precision weighting and the tracking
of prediction error dynamics. These mechanisms should help to explore more complex behaviors and
tasks in cognitive robotics research under the predictive processing framework.

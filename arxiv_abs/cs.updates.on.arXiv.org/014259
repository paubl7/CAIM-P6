An interesting research problem in supply chain industry is evaluating and determining provenance
of physical goods - demonstrating authenticity of luxury goods. Yet, there have been a few innovative
software solutions addressing product anti-counterfeiting and record provenance of today's
goods that are produced and transported in complex and internationally-spanning supply chain
networks. However, these supply chain systems have been implemented with centralized system architecture,
relying on centralized authorities or any form of intermediaries, and leading to issues such as
single-point processing, storage and failure, which could be susceptible to malicious modifications
of product records or various potential attacks to system components by dishonest participant
nodes traversing along the supply chain. Blockchain technology has evolved from being merely a
decentralized, distributed and immutable ledger of cryptocurrency transactions to a programmable
interactive environment for building decentralized and reliable applications addressing different
use cases and existing problems in the world. In this research, the Decentralized NFC-Enabled Anti-Counterfeiting
System (dNAS) is proposed and developed, decentralizing a legacy anti-counterfeiting system
of supply chain industry using Blockchain technology, to facilitate trustworthy data provenance
retrieval, verification and management, as well as strengthening capability of product anti-counterfeiting
in supply chain industry. The proposed dNAS utilizes decentralized blockchain network on a consensus
protocol compatible with the concept of enterprise consortium, programmable smart contracts
and a distributed file storage system to develop a secure and immutable scientific data provenance
tracking and management platform on which provenance records, providing compelling properties
on data integrity, are validated automatically.

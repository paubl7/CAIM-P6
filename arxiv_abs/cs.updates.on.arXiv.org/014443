Enormous amounts of data are being produced everyday by sub-meters and smart sensors installed
in residential buildings. If leveraged properly, that data could assist end-users, energy producers
and utility companies in detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of
each anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem becoming overwhelming.
Moreover, it will aid in better decision-making to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable
and energy efficient behavior. In this regard, this paper is an in-depth review of existing anomaly
detection frameworks for building energy consumption based on artificial intelligence. Specifically,
an extensive survey is presented, in which a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced to classify existing
algorithms based on different modules and parameters adopted, such as machine learning algorithms,
feature extraction approaches, anomaly detection levels, computing platforms and application
scenarios. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the first review article that discusses
anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving forward, important findings along with
domain-specific problems, difficulties and challenges that remain unresolved are thoroughly
discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions of anomalous power consumption,
(ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance of existing solutions,
(iv) platforms for reproducibility and (v) privacy-preservation. Following, insights about
current research trends are discussed to widen the applications and effectiveness of the anomaly
detection technology before deriving future directions attracting significant attention. This
article serves as a comprehensive reference to understand the current technological progress
in anomaly detection of energy consumption based on artificial intelligence.

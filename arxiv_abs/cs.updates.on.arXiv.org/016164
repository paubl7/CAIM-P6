Context: In the light of the swift and iterative nature of Agile Software Development (ASD) practices,
establishing deeper insights into capability measurement within the context of team formation
is crucial, as the capability of individuals and teams can affect team performance and productivity.
Although a former Systematic Literature Review (SLR) synthesized the state of the art in relation
to capability measurement in ASD with a focus on selecting individuals to agile teams, and capabilities
related to team performance and success, determining to what degree the SLR's results apply to practice
can provide progressive insights to both research and practice. Objective: Our study investigates
how agile practitioners perceive the relevance of individual and team level measures for characterizing
the capability of an agile team and its members. Furthermore, to scrutinize variations in practitioners'
perceptions, our study further analyzes perceptions across stratified demographic groups. Method:
We undertook a Web-based survey using a questionnaire built based on the capability measures identified
from a previously conducted SLR. Results: Our survey responses (60) indicate that 127 individual
and 28 team capability measures were considered as relevant by the majority of practitioners. We
also identified seven individual and one team capability measure that have not been previously
characterized by our SLR. The surveyed practitioners suggested that an agile team member's responsibility
and questioning skills significantly represent the member's capability. Conclusion: Results
from our survey align with our SLR's findings. Measures associated with social aspects were observed
to be dominant compared to technical and innovative aspects. Our results can support agile practitioners
in their team composition decisions.

Visual-Inertial odometry (VIO) is known to suffer from drifting especially over long-term runs.
In this paper, we present GVINS, a non-linear optimization based system that tightly fuses GNSS
raw measurements with visual and inertial information for real-time and drift-free state estimation.
Our system is aiming to provide accurate global 6-DoF estimation under complex indoor-outdoor
environment where GNSS signals may be largely intercepted or even totally unavailable. To connect
global measurements with local states, a coarse-to-fine initialization procedure is proposed
to efficiently online calibrate the transformation and initialize GNSS states from only a short
window of measurements. The GNSS pseudorange and Doppler shift measurements are then modelled
and optimized under a factor graph framework along with visual and inertial constraints. For complex
and GNSS-unfriendly areas, the degenerate cases are discussed and carefully handled to ensure
robustness. The engineering challenges involved in the system are also included to facilitate
relevant GNSS fusion researches. Thanks to the tightly-coupled multi-sensor approach and system
design, our system fully exploits the merits of three types of sensors and is capable to seamlessly
cope with the transition between indoor and outdoor environments, where satellites are lost and
recaptured again. We extensively evaluate the proposed system by both simulation and real-world
experiments, and the result demonstrates that our system substantially eliminates the drift of
VIO and preserves the local accuracy in spite of noisy GNSS measurements. In addition, experiments
also show that our system can gain from even a single satellite while conventional GNSS algorithms
need four at lease.

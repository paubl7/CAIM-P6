Let $G = (V,E,w)$ be a weighted, digraph subject to a sequence of adversarial edge deletions. In the
decremental single-source reachability problem (SSR), we are given a fixed source $s$ and the goal
is to maintain a data structure that can answer path-queries $s \rightarrowtail v$ for any $v \in
V$. In the more general single-source shortest paths (SSSP) problem the goal is to return an approximate
shortest path to $v$, and in the SCC problem the goal is to maintain strongly connected components
of $G$ and to answer path queries within each component. All of these problems have been very actively
studied over the past two decades, but all the fast algorithms are randomized and, more significantly,
they can only answer path queries if they assume a weaker model: they assume an oblivious adversary
which is not adaptive and must fix the update sequence in advance. This assumption significantly
limits the use of these data structures, most notably preventing them from being used as subroutines
in static algorithms. All the above problems are notoriously difficult in the adaptive setting.
In fact, the state-of-the-art is still the Even and Shiloach tree, which dates back all the way to
1981 and achieves total update time $O(mn)$. We present the first algorithms to break through this
barrier: 1) deterministic decremental SSR/SCC with total update time $mn^{2/3 + o(1)}$ 2) deterministic
decremental SSSP with total update time $n^{2+2/3+o(1)}$. To achieve these results, we develop
two general techniques of broader interest for working with dynamic graphs: 1) a generalization
of expander-based tools to dynamic directed graphs, and 2) a technique that we call congestion balancing
and which provides a new method for maintaining flow under adversarial deletions. Using the second
technique, we provide the first near-optimal algorithm for decremental bipartite matching.

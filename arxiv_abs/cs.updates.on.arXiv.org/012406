The recent coronavirus pandemic has highlighted the many challenges faced by the healthcare, public
safety, and economic systems when confronted with a surge in patients that require intensive treatment
and a population that must be quarantined or shelter in place. The most obvious and pressing challenge
is taking care of acutely ill patients while managing spread of infection within the care facility,
but this is just the tip of the iceberg if we consider what could be done to prepare in advance for future
pandemics. Beyond the obvious need for strengthening medical knowledge and preparedness, there
is a complementary need to anticipate and address the engineering challenges associated with infectious
disease emergencies. Robotic technologies are inherently programmable, and robotic systems
have been adapted and deployed, to some extent, in the current crisis for such purposes as transport,
logistics, and disinfection. As technical capabilities advance and as the installed base of robotic
systems increases in the future, they could play a much more significant role in future crises. This
report is the outcome of a virtual workshop co-hosted by the National Academy of Engineering (NAE)
and the Computing Community Consortium (CCC) held on July 9-10, 2020. The workshop consisted of
over forty participants including representatives from the engineering/robotics community,
clinicians, critical care workers, public health and safety experts, and emergency responders.
It identifies key challenges faced by healthcare responders and the general population and then
identifies robotic/technological responses to these challenges. Then it identifies the key research/knowledge
barriers that need to be addressed in developing effective, scalable solutions. Finally, the report
ends with the following recommendations on how to implement this strategy.

Gait event detection of the initial contact and toe off is essential for running gait analysis, allowing
the derivation of parameters such as stance time. Heuristic-based methods exist to estimate these
key gait events from tibial accelerometry. However, these methods are tailored to very specific
acceleration profiles, which may offer complications when dealing with larger data sets and inherent
biological variability. Therefore, this paper investigates whether a structured machine learning
approach can achieve a more accurate prediction of running gait event timings from tibial accelerometry.
Force-based event detection acted as the criterion measure in order to assess the accuracy, repeatability
and sensitivity of the predicted gait events. A heuristic method and two structured machine learning
methods were employed to derive initial contact, toe off and stance time from tibial acceleration
signals. Both a structured perceptron model (median absolute error of stance time estimation:
10.00 $\pm$ 8.73 ms) and a structured recurrent neural network model (median absolute error of stance
time estimation: 6.50 $\pm$ 5.74 ms) significantly outperformed the existing heuristic approach
(median absolute error of stance time estimation: 11.25 $\pm$ 9.52 ms) on data from 93 rearfoot runners.
Thus, results indicate that a structured recurrent neural network machine learning model offers
the most accurate and consistent estimation of the gait events and its derived stance time during
level overground running. The machine learning methods seem less affected by intra- and inter-subject
variation within the data, allowing for accurate and efficient automated data output during rearfoot
overground running. Furthermore offering possibilities for real-time monitoring and biofeedback
during prolonged measurements, even outside the laboratory.

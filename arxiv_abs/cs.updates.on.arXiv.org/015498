Influenza, an infectious disease, causes many deaths worldwide. Predicting influenza victims
during epidemics is an important task for clinical, hospital, and community outbreak preparation.
On-line user-generated contents (UGC), primarily in the form of social media posts or search query
logs, are generally used for prediction for reaction to sudden and unusual outbreaks. However,
most studies rely only on the UGC as their resource and do not use various UGCs. Our study aims to solve
these questions about Influenza prediction: Which model is the best? What combination of multiple
UGCs works well? What is the nature of each UGC? We adapt some models, LASSO Regression, Huber Regression,
Support Vector Machine regression with Linear kernel (SVR) and Random Forest, to test the influenza
volume prediction in Japan during 2015 - 2018. For that, we use on-line five data resources: (1) past
flu patients, (2) SNS (Twitter), (3) search engines (Yahoo! Japan), (4) shopping services (Yahoo!
Shopping), and (5) Q&A services (Yahoo! Chiebukuro) as resources of each model. We then validate
respective resources contributions using the best model, Huber Regression, with all resources
except one resource. Finally, we use Bayesian change point method for ascertaining whether the
trend of time series on any resources is reflected in the trend of flu patient count or not. Our experiments
show Huber Regression model based on various data resources produces the most accurate results.
Then, from the change point analysis, we get the result that search query logs and social media posts
for three years represents these resources as a good predictor. Conclusions: We show that Huber
Regression based on various data resources is strong for outliers and is suitable for the flu prediction.
Additionally, we indicate the characteristics of each resource for the flu prediction.

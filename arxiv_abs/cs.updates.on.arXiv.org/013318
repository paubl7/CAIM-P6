Spatially-adaptive normalization (SPADE) is remarkably successful recently in conditional
semantic image synthesis, which modulates the normalized activation with spatially-varying
transformations learned from semantic layouts, to prevent the semantic information from being
washed away. Despite its impressive performance, a more thorough understanding of the advantages
inside the box is still highly demanded to help reduce the significant computation and parameter
overhead introduced by this novel structure. In this paper, from a return-on-investment point
of view, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the effectiveness of this spatially-adaptive normalization
and observe that its modulation parameters benefit more from semantic-awareness rather than spatial-adaptiveness,
especially for high-resolution input masks. Inspired by this observation, we propose class-adaptive
normalization (CLADE), a lightweight but equally-effective variant that is only adaptive to semantic
class. In order to further improve spatial-adaptiveness, we introduce intra-class positional
map encoding calculated from semantic layouts to modulate the normalization parameters of CLADE
and propose a truly spatially-adaptive variant of CLADE, namely CLADE-ICPE. %Benefiting from
this design, CLADE greatly reduces the computation cost while being able to preserve the semantic
information in the generation. Through extensive experiments on multiple challenging datasets,
we demonstrate that the proposed CLADE can be generalized to different SPADE-based methods while
achieving comparable generation quality compared to SPADE, but it is much more efficient with fewer
extra parameters and lower computational cost. The code is available at https://github.com/tzt101/CLADE.git

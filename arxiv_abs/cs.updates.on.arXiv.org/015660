Adding to the literature on the data-driven detection of bid-rigging cartels, we propose a novel
approach based on deep learning (a subfield of artificial intelligence) that flags cartel participants
based on their pairwise bidding interactions with other firms. More concisely, we combine a so-called
convolutional neural network for image recognition with graphs that in a pairwise manner plot the
normalized bid values of some reference firm against the normalized bids of any other firms participating
in the same tenders as the reference firm. Based on Japanese and Swiss procurement data, we construct
such graphs for both collusive and competitive episodes (i.e when a bid-rigging cartel is or is not
active) and use a subset of graphs to train the neural network such that it learns distinguishing
collusive from competitive bidding patterns. We use the remaining graphs to test the neural network's
out-of-sample performance in correctly classifying collusive and competitive bidding interactions.
We obtain a very decent average accuracy of around 90% or slightly higher when either applying the
method within Japanese, Swiss, or mixed data (in which Swiss and Japanese graphs are pooled). When
using data from one country for training to test the trained model's performance in the other country
(i.e. transnationally), predictive performance decreases (likely due to institutional differences
in procurement procedures across countries), but often remains satisfactorily high. All in all,
the generally quite high accuracy of the convolutional neural network despite being trained in
a rather small sample of a few 100 graphs points to a large potential of deep learning approaches for
flagging and fighting bid-rigging cartels.

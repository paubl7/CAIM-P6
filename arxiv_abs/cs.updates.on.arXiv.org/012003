As vehicles playing an increasingly important role in people's daily life, requirements on safer
and more comfortable driving experience have arisen. Connected vehicles (CVs) can provide enabling
technologies to realize these requirements and have attracted widespread attentions from both
academia and industry. These requirements ask for a well-designed computing architecture to support
the Quality-of-Service (QoS) of CV applications. Computation offloading techniques, such as
cloud, edge, and fog computing, can help CVs process computation-intensive and large-scale computing
tasks. Additionally, different cloud/edge/fog computing architectures are suitable for supporting
different types of CV applications with highly different QoS requirements, which demonstrates
the importance of the computing architecture design. However, most of the existing surveys on cloud/edge/fog
computing for CVs overlook the computing architecture design, where they (i) only focus on one specific
computing architecture and (ii) lack discussions on benefits, research challenges, and system
requirements of different architectural alternatives. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
survey on different architectural design alternatives based on cloud/edge/fog computing for
CVs. The contributions of this paper are: (i) providing a comprehensive literature survey on existing
proposed architectural design alternatives based on cloud/edge/fog computing for CVs, (ii) proposing
a new classification of computing architectures based on cloud/edge/fog computing for CVs: computation-aided
and computation-enabled architectures, (iii) presenting a holistic comparison among different
cloud/edge/fog computing architectures for CVs based on functional requirements of CV systems,
including advantages, disadvantages, and research challenges.

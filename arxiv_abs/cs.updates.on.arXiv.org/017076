Predicting the next interaction of a short-term interaction session is a challenging task in session-based
recommendation. Almost all existing works rely on item transition patterns, and neglect the impact
of user historical sessions while modeling user preference, which often leads to non-personalized
recommendation. Additionally, existing personalized session-based recommenders capture user
preference only based on the sessions of the current user, but ignore the useful item-transition
patterns from other user's historical sessions. To address these issues, we propose a novel Heterogeneous
Global Graph Neural Networks (HG-GNN) to exploit the item transitions over all sessions in a subtle
manner for better inferring user preference from the current and historical sessions. To effectively
exploit the item transitions over all sessions from users, we propose a novel heterogeneous global
graph that contains item transitions of sessions, user-item interactions and global co-occurrence
items. Moreover, to capture user preference from sessions comprehensively, we propose to learn
two levels of user representations from the global graph via two graph augmented preference encoders.
Specifically, we design a novel heterogeneous graph neural network (HGNN) on the heterogeneous
global graph to learn the long-term user preference and item representations with rich semantics.
Based on the HGNN, we propose the Current Preference Encoder and the Historical Preference Encoder
to capture the different levels of user preference from the current and historical sessions, respectively.
To achieve personalized recommendation, we integrate the representations of the user current
preference and historical interests to generate the final user preference representation. Extensive
experimental results on three real-world datasets show that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art
methods.

Motivation: Early detection and isolation of COVID-19 patients are essential for successful implementation
of mitigation strategies and eventually curbing the disease spread. With a limited number of daily
COVID19 tests performed in every country, simulating the COVID-19 spread along with the potential
effect of each mitigation strategy currently remains one of the most effective ways in managing
the healthcare system and guiding policy-makers. We introduce COVIDHunter, a flexible and accurate
COVID-19 outbreak simulation model that evaluates the current mitigation measures that are applied
to a region and provides suggestions on what strength the upcoming mitigation measure should be.
The key idea of COVIDHunter is to quantify the spread of COVID-19 in a geographical region by simulating
the average number of new infections caused by an infected person considering the effect of external
factors, such as environmental conditions (e.g., climate, temperature, humidity) and mitigation
measures. Results: Using Switzerland as a case study, COVIDHunter estimates that the policy-makers
need to keep the current mitigation measures for at least 30 days to prevent demand from quickly exceeding
existing hospital capacity. Relaxing the mitigation measures by 50% for 30 days increases both
the daily capacity need for hospital beds and daily number of deaths exponentially by an average
of 23.8x, who may occupy ICU beds and ventilators for a period of time. Unlike existing models, the
COVIDHunter model accurately monitors and predicts the daily number of cases, hospitalizations,
and deaths due to COVID-19. Our model is flexible to configure and simple to modify for modeling different
scenarios under different environmental conditions and mitigation measures. Availability:

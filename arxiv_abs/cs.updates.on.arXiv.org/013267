Wireless cellular System on Chip (SoC) are experiencing unprecedented demands on data rate, latency
use case variety. 5G wireless technologies require a massive number of antennas and complex signal
processing to improve bandwidth and spectral efficiency. The Internet of Things is causing a proliferation
in the number of connected devices, and service categories, such as ultra-reliable low latency,
which will produce new use cases, such as self-driving cars, robotic factories, and remote surgery.
In addressing these challenges, we can no longer rely on faster cores, or even more silicon. Modem
software development is becoming increasingly error prone and difficult as the complexity of the
applications and the architectures increase. In this report we propose a Wireless Domain Specific
Solution that takes a Dataflow acceleration approach and addresses the need of the SoC to support
dataflows that change with use case and user activity, while maintaining the Firm Real Time High
Availability with low probability of Heisenbugs that is required in cellular modems. We do this
by developing a Domain Specific Architecture that describes the requirements in a suitably abstracted
dataflow Domain Specific language. A toolchain is described that automates translation of those
requirements in an efficient and robust manner and provides formal guarantees against Heisenbugs.
The dataflow native DSA supports the toolchain output with specialized processing, data management
and control features with high performance and low power, and recovers rapidly from dropped dataflows
while continuing to achieve the real time requirements. This report focuses on the dataflow acceleration
in the DSA and the part of the automated toolchain that formally checks the performance and correctness
of software running on this dataflow hardware. Results are presented and a summary of future work
is given.

More than 144 000 Australians were diagnosed with cancer in 2019. The majority will first present
to their GP symptomatically, even for cancer for which screening programs exist. Diagnosing cancer
in primary care is challenging due to the non-specific nature of cancer symptoms and its low prevalence.
Understanding the epidemiology of cancer symptoms and patterns of presentation in patient's medical
history from primary care data could be important to improve earlier detection and cancer outcomes.
As past medical data about a patient can be incomplete, irregular or missing, this creates additional
challenges when attempting to use the patient's history for any new diagnosis. Our research aims
to investigate the opportunities in a patient's pathology history available to a GP, initially
focused on the results within the frequently ordered full blood count to determine relevance to
a future high-risk cancer prognosis, and treatment outcome. We investigated how past pathology
test results can lead to deriving features that can be used to predict cancer outcomes, with emphasis
on patients at risk of not surviving the cancer within 2-year period. This initial work focuses on
patients with lung cancer, although the methodology can be applied to other types of cancer and other
data within the medical record. Our findings indicate that even in cases of incomplete or obscure
patient history, hematological measures can be useful in generating features relevant for predicting
cancer risk and survival. The results strongly indicate to add the use of pathology test data for
potential high-risk cancer diagnosis, and the utilize additional pathology metrics or other primary
care datasets even more for similar purposes.

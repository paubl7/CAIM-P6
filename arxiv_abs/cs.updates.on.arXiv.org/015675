Context: Backsourcing is the process of insourcing previously outsourced activities. When companies
experience environmental or strategic changes, or challenges with outsourcing, backsourcing
can be a viable alternative. While outsourcing and related processes have been extensively studied
in software engineering, few studies report experiences with backsourcing. Objectives: We intend
to summarize the results of the research literature on the backsourcing of IT, with a focus on software
development. By identifying practical relevance experience, we aim to present findings that may
help companies considering backsourcing. In addition, we aim to identify gaps in the current research
literature and point out areas for future work. Method: Our systematic literature review (SLR)
started with a search for empirical studies on the backsourcing of software development. From each
study we identified the contexts in which backsourcing occurs, the factors leading to the decision
to backsource, the backsourcing process itself, and the outcomes of backsourcing. We employed
inductive coding to extract textual data from the papers identified and qualitative cross-case
analysis to synthesize the evidence from backsourcing experiences. Results: We identified 17
papers that reported 26 cases of backsourcing, six of which were related to software development.
The cases came from a variety of contexts. The most common reasons for backsourcing were improving
quality, reducing costs, and regaining control of outsourced activities. The backsourcing process
can be described as containing five sub-processes: change management, vendor relationship management,
competence building, organizational build-up, and transfer of ownership. Furthermore, ...

In nominal mission scenarios, geostationary satellites perform end-of-life orbit maneuvers
to reach suitable disposal orbits, where they do not interfere with operational satellites. This
research investigates the long-term orbit evolution of decommissioned geostationary satellite
under the assumption that the disposal maneuver does not occur and the orbit evolves with no control.
The dynamical model accounts for all the relevant harmonics of the gravity field at the altitude
of geostationary orbits, as well as solar radiation pressure and third-body perturbations caused
by the Moon and the Sun. Orbit propagations are performed using two algorithms based on different
equations of motion and numerical integration methods: (i) Gauss planetary equations for modified
equinoctial elements with a Runge-Kutta numerical integration scheme based on 8-7th-order Dorman
and Prince formulas; (ii) Cartesian state equations of motion in an Earth-fixed frame with a Runge-Kutta
Fehlberg 7/8 integration scheme. The numerical results exhibit excellent agreement over integration
times of decades. Some well-known phenomena emerge, such as the longitudinal drift due to the resonance
between the orbital motion and Earth's rotation, attributable to the J22 term of the geopotential.
In addition, the third-body perturbation due to Sun and Moon causes two major effects: (a) a precession
of the orbital plane, and (b) complex longitudinal dynamics. This study proposes an analytical
approach for the prediction of the precessional motion and shows its agreement with the orbit evolution
obtained numerically. Moreover, long-term orbit propagations show that the above mentioned complex
longitudinal dynamics persists over time scales of several decades. Frequent and unpredictable
migrations toward different longitude regions occur, in contrast with the known effects due only
to the J22 perturbation.

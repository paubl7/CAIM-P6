Voter eligibility in United States elections is determined by a patchwork of state databases containing
information about which citizens are eligible to vote. Administrators at the state and local level
are faced with the exceedingly difficult task of ensuring that each of their jurisdictions is properly
managed, while also monitoring for improper modifications to the database. Monitoring changes
to Voter Registration Files (VRFs) is crucial, given that a malicious actor wishing to disrupt the
democratic process in the US would be well-advised to manipulate the contents of these files in order
to achieve their goals. In 2020, we saw election officials perform admirably when faced with administering
one of the most contentious elections in US history, but much work remains to secure and monitor the
election systems Americans rely on. Using data created by comparing snapshots taken of VRFs over
time, we present a set of methods that make use of machine learning to ease the burden on analysts and
administrators in protecting voter rolls. We first evaluate the effectiveness of multiple unsupervised
anomaly detection methods in detecting VRF modifications by modeling anomalous changes as sparse
additive noise. In this setting we determine that statistical models comparing administrative
districts within a short time span and non-negative matrix factorization are most effective for
surfacing anomalous events for review. These methods were deployed during 2019-2020 in our organization's
monitoring system and were used in collaboration with the office of the Iowa Secretary of State.
Additionally, we propose a newly deployed model which uses historical and demographic metadata
to label the likely root cause of database modifications. We hope to use this model to predict which
modifications have known causes and therefore better identify potentially anomalous modifications.

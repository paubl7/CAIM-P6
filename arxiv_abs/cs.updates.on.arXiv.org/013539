Condition-based monitoring (CBM) has been widely utilised in the wind industry for monitoring
operational inconsistencies and failures in turbines, with techniques ranging from signal processing
and vibration analysis to artificial intelligence (AI) models using Supervisory Control & Acquisition
(SCADA) data. However, existing studies do not present a concrete basis to facilitate explainable
decision support in operations and maintenance (O&M), particularly for automated decision support
through recommendation of appropriate maintenance action reports corresponding to failures
predicted by CBM techniques. Knowledge graph databases (KGs) model a collection of domain-specific
information and have played an intrinsic role for real-world decision support in domains such as
healthcare and finance, but have seen very limited attention in the wind industry. We propose XAI4Wind,
a multimodal knowledge graph for explainable decision support in real-world operational turbines
and demonstrate through experiments several use-cases of the proposed KG towards O&M planning
through interactive query and reasoning and providing novel insights using graph data science
algorithms. The proposed KG combines multimodal knowledge like SCADA parameters and alarms with
natural language maintenance actions, images etc. By integrating our KG with an Explainable AI
model for anomaly prediction, we show that it can provide effective human-intelligible O&M strategies
for predicted operational inconsistencies in various turbine sub-components. This can help instil
better trust and confidence in conventionally black-box AI models. We make our KG publicly available
and envisage that it can serve as the building ground for providing autonomous decision support
in the wind industry.

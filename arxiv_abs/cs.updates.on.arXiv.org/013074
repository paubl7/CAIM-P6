The inference performance of the pseudolikelihood method is discussed in the framework of the inverse
Ising problem when the $\ell_2$-regularized (ridge) linear regression is adopted. This setup
is introduced for theoretically investigating the situation where the data generation model is
different from the inference one, namely the model mismatch situation. In the teacher-student
scenario under the assumption that the teacher couplings are sparse, the analysis is conducted
using the replica and cavity methods, with a special focus on whether the presence/absence of teacher
couplings is correctly inferred or not. The result indicates that despite the model mismatch, one
can perfectly identify the network structure using naive linear regression without regularization
when the number of spins $N$ is smaller than the dataset size $M$, in the thermodynamic limit $N\to
\infty$. Further, to access the underdetermined region $M < N$, we examine the effect of the $\ell_2$
regularization, and find that biases appear in all the coupling estimates, preventing the perfect
identification of the network structure. We, however, find that the biases are shown to decay exponentially
fast as the distance from the center spin chosen in the pseudolikelihood method grows. Based on this
finding, we propose a two-stage estimator: In the first stage, the ridge regression is used and the
estimates are pruned by a relatively small threshold; in the second stage the naive linear regression
is conducted only on the remaining couplings, and the resultant estimates are again pruned by another
relatively large threshold. This estimator with the appropriate regularization coefficient
and thresholds is shown to achieve the perfect identification of the network structure even in $0<M/N<1$.
Results of extensive numerical experiments support these findings.

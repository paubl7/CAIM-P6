To reduce Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs on offshore wind farms, wherein 80% of the O&M cost
relates to deploying personnel, the offshore wind sector looks to robotics and Artificial Intelligence
(AI) for solutions. Barriers to Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) robotics include operational
safety compliance and resilience, inhibiting the commercialization of autonomous services offshore.
To address safety and resilience challenges we propose a symbiotic system; reflecting the lifecycle
learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing for mutual gain of robotic platforms and remote
human operators. Our methodology enables the run-time verification of safety, reliability and
resilience during autonomous missions. We synchronize digital models of the robot, environment
and infrastructure and integrate front-end analytics and bidirectional communication for autonomous
adaptive mission planning and situation reporting to a remote operator. A reliability ontology
for the deployed robot, based on our holistic hierarchical-relational model, supports computationally
efficient platform data analysis. We analyze the mission status and diagnostics of critical sub-systems
within the robot to provide automatic updates to our run-time reliability ontology, enabling faults
to be translated into failure modes for decision making during the mission. We demonstrate an asset
inspection mission within a confined space and employ millimeter-wave sensing to enhance situational
awareness to detect the presence of obscured personnel to mitigate risk. Our results demonstrate
a symbiotic system provides an enhanced resilience capability to BVLOS missions. A symbiotic system
addresses the operational challenges and reprioritization of autonomous mission objectives.
This advances the technology required to achieve fully trustworthy autonomous systems.

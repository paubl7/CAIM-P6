Krylov subspace recycling is a powerful tool for solving long series of large, sparse linear systems
that change slowly. In PDE constrained shape optimization, these appear naturally, as hundreds
or more optimization steps are needed with only small changes in the geometry. In this setting, however,
applying Krylov subspace recycling can be difficult. As the geometry evolves, so does the finite
element mesh, especially if re-meshing is needed. As a result, the number of algebraic degrees of
freedom in the system may change from one optimization step to the next, and with it the size of the
finite element system matrix. Changes in the mesh also lead to structural changes in the matrices.
In the case of remeshing, even if the geometry changes only a little, the corresponding mesh might
differ substantially from the previous one. This prevents any straightforward mapping of the approximate
invariant subspace of the linear system matrix (the focus of recycling in this paper) from one step
to the next; similar problems arise for other selected subspaces. We present an algorithm for general
meshes to map an approximate invariant subspace of the system matrix for the previous optimization
step to an approximate invariant subspace of the system matrix for the current optimization step.
We exploit the map from coefficient vectors to finite element functions on the mesh combined with
function approximation on the finite element mesh. In addition, we develop a straightforward warm-start
adaptation of the Krylov-Schur algorithm [G.W. Stewart, SIAM J. Matrix Anal. Appl. 23, 2001] to
improve the approximate invariant subspace at the start of a new optimization step if needed. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach numerically with several proof of concept studies
for a specific meshing technique.

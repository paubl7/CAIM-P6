An immediate snapshot object is a high level communication object, built on top of a read/write distributed
system in which all except one processes may crash. It allows a process to write a value and obtain
a set of values that represent a snapshot of the values written to the object, occurring immediately
after the write step. Considering an $n$-process model in which up to $t$ processes may crash, this
paper introduces first the $k$-resilient immediate snapshot object, which is a natural generalization
of the basic immediate snapshot (which corresponds to the case $k=t=n-1$). In addition to the set
containment properties of the basic immediate snapshot, a $k$-resilient immediate snapshot object
requires that each set returned to a process contains at least $(n-k)$ pairs. The paper first shows
that, for $k,t<n-1$, $k$-resilient immediate snapshot is impossible in asynchronous read/write
systems. %Then the paper investigates the space of objects that %are impossible to solve in $n$-process
$t$-crash read/write systems. Then the paper investigates a model of computation where the processes
communicate with each other by accessing $k$-immediate snapshot objects, and shows that this model
is stronger than the $t$-crash model. Considering the space of $x$-set agreement problems (which
are impossible to solve in systems such that $x\leq t$), the paper shows then that $x$-set agreement
can be solved in read/write systems enriched with $k$-immediate snapshot objects for $x=\max(1,t+k-(n-2))$.
It also shows that, in these systems, $k$-resilient immediate snapshot and consensus are equivalent
when $1\leq t<n/2$ and $t\leq k\leq (n-1)-t$. Hence, %thanks to the problem map it provides, the
paper establishes strong relations linking fundamental distributed computing objects (one related
to communication, the other to agreement), which are impossible to solve in pure read/write systems.

We propose a self-stabilizing algorithm to construct a minimal weakly $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable
directed acyclic graph (DAG), which is suited for routing messages on wireless networks. Given
an arbitrary, simple, connected, and undirected graph $G=(V, E)$ and two sets of nodes, senders
$\mathcal{S} (\subset V)$ and targets $\mathcal{T} (\subset V)$, a directed subgraph $\vec{G}$
of $G$ is a weakly $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG on $G$, if $\vec{G}$ is a DAG and every sender can
reach at least one target, and every target is reachable from at least one sender in $\vec{G}$. We
say that a weakly $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG $\vec{G}$ on $G$ is minimal if any proper subgraph
of $\vec{G}$ is no longer a weakly $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG. This DAG is a relaxed version of
the original (or strongly) $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG, where every target is reachable from
every sender. This is because a strongly $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG $G$ does not always exist;
some graph has no strongly $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable DAG even in the case $|\mathcal{S}|=|\mathcal{T}|=2$.
On the other hand, the proposed algorithm always constructs a weakly $\mathcal{ST}$-reachable
DAG for any $|\mathcal{S}|$ and $|\mathcal{T}|$. Furthermore, the proposed algorithm is self-stabilizing;
even if the constructed DAG deviates from the reachability requirement by a breakdown or exhausting
the battery of a node having an arc in the DAG, this algorithm automatically reconstructs the DAG
to satisfy the requirement again. The convergence time of the algorithm is $O(D)$ asynchronous
rounds, where $D$ is the diameter of a given graph. We conduct small simulations to evaluate the performance
of the proposed algorithm. The simulation result indicates that its execution time decreases when
the number of sender nodes or target nodes is large.

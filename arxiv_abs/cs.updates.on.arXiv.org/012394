In a previous paper, we introduced a framework for carrying out petrophysically and geologically
guided geophysical inversions. In that framework, petrophysical and geological information
is modelled with a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). In the inversion, the GMM serves as a prior for the
geophysical model. The formulation was confined to problems in which a single physical property
model was sought, with a single geophysical dataset. In this paper, we extend that framework to jointly
invert multiple geophysical datasets that depend on multiple physical properties. The petrophysical
and geological information is used to couple geophysical surveys that, otherwise, rely on independent
physics. This requires advancements in two areas. First, an extension from a univariate to a multivariate
analysis of the petrophysical data, and their inclusion within the inverse problem, is necessary.
Second, we address the practical issues of simultaneously inverting data from multiple surveys
and finding a solution that acceptably reproduces each one, along with the petrophysical and geological
information. To illustrate the efficacy of our approach and the advantages of carrying out multi-physics
inversions, we invert synthetic gravity and magnetic data associated with a kimberlite deposit.
The kimberlite pipe contains two distinct facies embedded in a host rock. Inverting the datasets
individually leads to a binary geological model: background or kimberlite. A multi-physics inversion,
with petrophysical information, differentiates between the two main kimberlite facies of the
pipe. Through this example, we also highlight the capabilities of our framework to work with interpretive
geologic assumptions when minimal quantitative information is available. In those cases, the
dynamic updates of the Gaussian Mixture Model allow us to perform multi-physics inversions by learning
a petrophysical model.

Many Deep Learning approaches solve complicated classification and regression problems by hierarchically
constructing complex features from the raw input data. Although a few works have investigated the
application of deep neural networks in recommendation domain, they mostly extract entity features
by exploiting unstructured auxiliary data such as visual and textual information, and when it comes
to using user-item rating matrix, feature extraction is done by using matrix factorization. As
matrix factorization has some limitations, some works have been done to replace it with deep neural
network. but these works either need to exploit unstructured data such item's reviews or images,
or are specially designed to use implicit data and don't take user-item rating matrix into account.
In this paper, we investigate the usage of novel representation learning algorithms to extract
users and items representations from rating matrix, and offer a deep neural network for Collaborative
Filtering. Our proposed approach is a modular algorithm consisted of two main phases: REpresentation
eXtraction and a deep neural NETwork (RexNet). Using two joint and parallel neural networks in RexNet
enables it to extract a hierarchy of features for each entity in order to predict the degree of interest
of users to items. The resulted predictions are then used for the final recommendation. Unlike other
deep learning recommendation approaches, RexNet is not dependent to unstructured auxiliary data
such as visual and textual information, instead, it uses only the user-item rate matrix as its input.
We evaluated RexNet in an extensive set of experiments against state of the art recommendation methods.
The results show that RexNet significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms in a variety of
data sets with different degrees of density.

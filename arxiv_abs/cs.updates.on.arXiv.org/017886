The increasingly diversified Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements envisioned for future wireless
networks call for more flexible and inclusive multiple access techniques for supporting emerging
applications and communication scenarios. To achieve this, we propose a multi-dimensional multiple
access (MDMA) protocol to meet individual User Equipment's (UE's) unique QoS demands while utilizing
multi-dimensional radio resources cost-effectively. In detail, the proposed scheme consists
of two new aspects, i.e., selection of a tailored multiple access mode for each UE while considering
the UE-specific radio resource utilization cost; and multi-dimensional radio resource allocation
among coexisting UEs under dynamic network conditions. To reduce the UE-specific resource utilization
cost, the base station (BS) organizes UEs with disparate multi-domain resource constraints as
UE coalition by considering each UE's specific resource availability, perceived quality, and
utilization capability. Each UE within a coalition could utilize its preferred radio resources,
which leads to low utilization cost while avoiding resource-sharing conflicts with remaining
UEs. Furthermore, to meet UE-specific QoS requirements and varying resource conditions at the
UE side, the multi-dimensional radio resource allocation among coexisting UEs is formulated as
an optimization problem to maximize the summation of cost-aware utility functions of all UEs. A
solution to solve this NP-hard problem with low complexity is developed using the successive convex
approximation and the Lagrange dual decomposition methods. The effectiveness of our proposed
scheme is validated by numerical simulation and performance comparison with state-of-the-art
schemes. In particular, the simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms
these benchmark schemes by large margins.

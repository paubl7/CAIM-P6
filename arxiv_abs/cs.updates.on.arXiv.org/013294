This paper introduces an automated vision system for animal detection in trail-camera images taken
from a field under the administration of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. As traditional
wildlife counting techniques are intrusive and labor intensive to conduct, trail-camera imaging
is a comparatively non-intrusive method for capturing wildlife activity. However, given the large
volume of images produced from trail-cameras, manual analysis of the images remains time-consuming
and inefficient. We implemented a two-stage deep convolutional neural network pipeline to find
animal-containing images in the first stage and then process these images to detect birds in the
second stage. The animal classification system classifies animal images with overall 93% sensitivity
and 96% specificity. The bird detection system achieves better than 93% sensitivity, 92% specificity,
and 68% average Intersection-over-Union rate. The entire pipeline processes an image in less than
0.5 seconds as opposed to an average 30 seconds for a human labeler. We also addressed post-deployment
issues related to data drift for the animal classification system as image features vary with seasonal
changes. This system utilizes an automatic retraining algorithm to detect data drift and update
the system. We introduce a novel technique for detecting drifted images and triggering the retraining
procedure. Two statistical experiments are also presented to explain the prediction behavior
of the animal classification system. These experiments investigate the cues that steers the system
towards a particular decision. Statistical hypothesis testing demonstrates that the presence
of an animal in the input image significantly contributes to the system's decisions.

Nowadays, the amount of heterogeneous biomedical data is increasing more and more thanks to novel
sensing techniques and high-throughput technologies. In reference to biomedical image analysis,
the advances in image acquisition modalities and high-throughput imaging experiments are creating
new challenges. This huge information ensemble could overwhelm the analytic capabilities needed
by physicians in their daily decision-making tasks as well as by biologists investigating complex
biochemical systems. In particular, quantitative imaging methods convey scientifically and
clinically relevant information in prediction, prognosis or treatment response assessment,
by also considering radiomics approaches. Therefore, the computational analysis of medical and
biological images plays a key role in radiology and laboratory applications. In this regard, frameworks
based on advanced Machine Learning and Computational Intelligence can significantly improve
traditional Image Processing and Pattern Recognition approaches. However, conventional Artificial
Intelligence techniques must be tailored to address the unique challenges concerning biomedical
imaging data. This thesis aims at proposing novel and advanced computer-assisted methods for biomedical
image analysis, also as an instrument in the development of Clinical Decision Support Systems,
by always keeping in mind the clinical feasibility of the developed solutions. In conclusion, the
ultimate goal of these research studies is to gain clinically and biologically useful insights
that can guide differential diagnosis and therapies, leading towards biomedical data integration
for personalized medicine. As a matter of fact, the proposed computer-assisted bioimage analysis
methods can be beneficial for the definition of imaging biomarkers, as well as for quantitative
medicine and biology.

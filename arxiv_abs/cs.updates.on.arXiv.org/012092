Background: Cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and non-hemorrhage iron deposits in the basal ganglia
have been associated with brain aging, vascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. Recent
advances using quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) make it possible to differentiate iron
content from mineralization in-vivo using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, automated
detection of such lesions is still challenging, making quantification in large cohort bases studies
rather limited. Purpose: Development of a fully automated method using deep learning for detecting
CMBs and basal ganglia iron deposits using multimodal MRI. Materials and Methods: We included a
convenience sample of 24 participants from the MESA cohort and used T2-weighted images, susceptibility
weighted imaging (SWI), and QSM to segment the lesions. We developed a protocol for simultaneous
manual annotation of CMBs and non-hemorrhage iron deposits in the basal ganglia, which resulted
in defining the gold standard. This gold standard was then used to train a deep convolution neural
network (CNN) model. Specifically, we adapted the U-Net model with a higher number of resolution
layers to be able to detect small lesions such as CMBs from standard resolution MRI which are used
in cohort-based studies. The detection performance was then evaluated using the cross-validation
principle in order to ensure generalization of the results. Results: With multi-class CNN models,
we achieved an average sensitivity and precision of about 0.8 and 0.6, respectively for detecting
CMBs. The same framework detected non-hemorrhage iron deposits reaching an average sensitivity
and precision of about 0.8. Conclusions: Our results showed that deep learning could automate the
detection of small vessel disease lesions and including multimodal MR data such as QSM can improve
the detection of CMB and non-hemorrhage iron deposits.

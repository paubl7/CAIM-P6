After decades of research, traditional BFT protocols have achieved nearly optimal performance
improvements. However, they still cannot meet the rapidly increasing performance and scalability
requirements of distributed systems, especially blockchain. Fortunately, the development of
trusted execution environments brings new opportunities. Utilizing TEE, BFT protocols can achieve
significant improvements, e.g., reduce the minimum number of replicas from 3f+1 to 2f+1. There
have been several TEE-based BFT protocols. They generally share a common BFT-driven design pattern,
i.e., to limit byzantine behaviors of replicas using TEE. However, while TEE solves some security
issues, it also introduces new security issues. With this confusing design pattern, a protocol
need not only tolerate arbitrary byzantine faults(which is already hard enough) but also handle
those new security issues. Consequently, those protocols are complex and difficult to understand.
With this drawback, those protocols have hardly been applied to real distributed systems. We start
from a different question, i.e., what are the key differences between TEE-based BFT and Crash Fault
Tolerance(CFT). We revisit CFT and propose four principles to help bridge the gap between TEE-based
BFT and CFT. Based on these principles, we propose a novel TEE-based BFT protocol called TBFT. With
inspirations from CFT, TBFT is more understandable and simpler compared to previous protocols.
With a solid foundation provided by existing CFT protocols, TBFT has more opportunities to be applied
to a practical system. Besides, We make comprehensive improvements to TBFT for both performance
and security. Our evaluation shows that TBFT has better performance and scalability compared to
previous protocols.

Bitcoin introduced delegation of control over a monetary system from a select few to all who participate
in that system. This delegation is known as the decentralization of controlling power and is a powerful
security mechanism for the ecosystem. After the introduction of Bitcoin, the field of cryptocurrency
has seen widespread attention from industry and academia, so much so that the original novel contribution
of Bitcoin i.e. decentralization, may be overlooked, due to decentralizations assumed fundamental
existence for the functioning of such cryptoassets. However recent studies have observed a trend
of increased centralization in cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum. As this increased
centralization has an impact the security of the blockchain, it is crucial that it is measured, towards
adequate control. This research derives an initial taxonomy of centralization present in decentralized
blockchains through rigorous synthesis using a systematic literature review. This is followed
by iterative refinement through expert interviews. We systematically analyzed 89 research papers
published between 2009 and 2019. Our study contributes to the existing body of knowledge by highlighting
the multiple definitions and measurements of centralization in the literature. We identify different
aspects of centralization and propose an encompassing taxonomy of centralization concerns. This
taxonomy is based on empirically observable and measurable characteristics. It consists of 13
aspects of centralization classified over six architectural layers Governance Network Consensus
Incentive Operational and Application. We also discuss how the implications of centralization
can vary depending on the aspects studied. We believe that this review and taxonomy provides a comprehensive
overview of centralization in decentralized blockchains involving various conceptualizations
and measures.

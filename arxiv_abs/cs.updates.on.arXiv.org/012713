Digital identity seems like a prerequisite for digital democracy: how can we ensure "one person,
one vote" online without identifying voters? But digital identity solutions - ID checking, biometrics,
self-sovereign identity, and trust networks - all present flaws, leaving users vulnerable to exclusion,
identity loss or theft, and coercion. These flaws may be insurmountable because digital identity
is a cart pulling the horse. We cannot achieve digital identity secure enough for the weight of digital
democracy, until we build it on a solid foundation of "digital personhood." While identity is about
distinguishing one person from another through attributes or affiliations, personhood is about
giving all real people inalienable digital participation rights independent of identity, including
protection against erosion of their democratic rights through identity loss, theft, coercion,
or fakery. We explore and analyze alternative approaches to "proof of personhood" that may provide
this missing foundation. Pseudonym parties marry the transparency of periodic physical-world
events with the power of digital tokens between events. These tokens represent limited-term but
renewable claims usable for purposes such as online voting or liquid democracy, sampled juries
or deliberative polls, abuse-resistant social communication, or minting universal basic income
in a permissionless cryptocurrency. Enhancing pseudonym parties to provide participants a moment
of enforced physical security and privacy can address coercion and vote-buying risks that plague
today's E-voting systems. We also examine other proposed approaches to proof of personhood, some
of which offer conveniences such as all-online participation. These alternatives currently fall
short of satisfying all the key digital personhood goals, unfortunately, but offer valuable insights
into the challenges we face.

Cyber situational awareness has been proven to be of value in forming a comprehensive understanding
of threats and vulnerabilities within organisations, as the degree of exposure is governed by the
prevailing levels of cyber-hygiene and established processes. A more accurate assessment of the
security provision informs on the most vulnerable environments that necessitate more diligent
management. The rapid proliferation in the automation of cyber-attacks is reducing the gap between
information and operational technologies and the need to review the current levels of robustness
against new sophisticated cyber-attacks, trends, technologies and mitigation countermeasures
has become pressing. A deeper characterisation is also the basis with which to predict future vulnerabilities
in turn guiding the most appropriate deployment technologies. Thus, refreshing established practices
and the scope of the training to support the decision making of users and operators. The foundation
of the training provision is the use of Cyber-Ranges (CRs) and Test-Beds (TBs), platforms/tools
that help inculcate a deeper understanding of the evolution of an attack and the methodology to deploy
the most impactful countermeasures to arrest breaches. In this paper, an evaluation of documented
CR and TB platforms is evaluated. CRs and TBs are segmented by type, technology, threat scenarios,
applications and the scope of attainable training. To enrich the analysis of documented CR and TB
research and cap the study, a taxonomy is developed to provide a broader comprehension of the future
of CRs and TBs. The taxonomy elaborates on the CRs/TBs different dimensions, as well as, highlighting
a diminishing differentiation between application areas.

Machine learning-based malware detection systems are often vulnerable to evasion attacks, in
which a malware developer manipulates their malicious software such that it is misclassified as
benign. Such software hides some properties of the real class or adopts some properties of a different
class by applying small perturbations. A special case of evasive malware hides by repackaging a
bonafide benign mobile app to contain malware in addition to the original functionality of the app,
thus retaining most of the benign properties of the original app. We present a novel malware detection
system based on metamorphic testing principles that can detect such benign-seeming malware apps.
We apply metamorphic testing to the feature representation of the mobile app rather than to the app
itself. That is, the source input is the original feature vector for the app and the derived input
is that vector with selected features removed. If the app was originally classified benign and is
indeed benign, the output for the source and derived inputs should be the same class, i.e., benign,
but if they differ, then the app is exposed as likely malware. Malware apps originally classified
as malware should retain that classification since only features prevalent in benign apps are removed.
This approach enables the machine learning model to classify repackaged malware with reasonably
few false negatives and false positives. Our training pipeline is simpler than many existing ML-based
malware detection methods, as the network is trained end-to-end to learn appropriate features
and perform classification. We pre-trained our classifier model on 3 million apps collected from
the widely-used AndroZoo dataset. We perform an extensive study on other publicly available datasets
to show our approach's effectiveness in detecting repackaged malware with more than94% accuracy,
0.98 precision, 0.95 recall, and 0.96 F1 score.

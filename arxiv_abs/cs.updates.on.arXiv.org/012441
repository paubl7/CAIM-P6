Automated machine learning (AutoML) is essentially automating the process of applying machine
learning to real-world problems. The primary goals of AutoML tools are to provide methods and processes
to make Machine Learning available for non-Machine Learning experts (domain experts), to improve
efficiency of Machine Learning and to accelerate research on Machine Learning. Although automation
and efficiency are some of AutoML's main selling points, the process still requires a surprising
level of human involvement. A number of vital steps of the machine learning pipeline, including
understanding the attributes of domain-specific data, defining prediction problems, creating
a suitable training data set etc. still tend to be done manually by a data scientist on an ad-hoc basis.
Often, this process requires a lot of back-and-forth between the data scientist and domain experts,
making the whole process more difficult and inefficient. Altogether, AutoML systems are still
far from a "real automatic system". In this review article, we present a level-wise taxonomic perspective
on AutoML systems to-date and beyond, i.e., we introduce a new classification system with seven
levels to distinguish AutoML systems based on their level of autonomy. We first start with a discussion
on how an end-to-end Machine learning pipeline actually looks like and which sub-tasks of Machine
learning Pipeline has indeed been automated so far. Next, we highlight the sub-tasks which are still
done manually by a data-scientist in most cases and how that limits a domain expert's access to Machine
learning. Then, we introduce the novel level-based taxonomy of AutoML systems and define each level
according to their scope of automation support. Finally, we provide a road-map of future research
endeavor in the area of AutoML and discuss some important challenges in achieving this ambitious
goal.

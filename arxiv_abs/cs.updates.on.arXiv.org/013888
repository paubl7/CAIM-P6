In the online non-metric variant of the facility location problem, there is a given graph consisting
of a set $F$ of facilities (each with a certain opening cost), a set $C$ of potential clients, and weighted
connections between them. The online part of the input is a sequence of clients from $C$, and in response
to any requested client, an online algorithm may open an additional subset of facilities and must
connect the given client to an open facility. We give an online, polynomial-time deterministic
algorithm for this problem, with a competitive ratio of $O(\log |F| \cdot (\log |C| + \log \log |F|))$.
The result is optimal up to loglog factors. Our algorithm improves over the $O((\log |C| + \log |F|)
\cdot (\log |C| + \log \log |F|))$-competitive construction that first reduces the facility location
instance to a set cover one and then later solves such instance using the deterministic algorithm
by Alon et al. [TALG 2006]. This is an asymptotic improvement in a typical scenario where $|F| \ll
|C|$. We achieve this by a more direct approach: we design an algorithm for a fractional relaxation
of the non-metric facility location problem with clustered facilities. To handle the constraints
of such non-covering LP, we combine the dual fitting and multiplicative weight updates approach.
By maintaining certain additional monotonicity properties of the created fractional solution,
we can handle the dependencies between facilities and connections in a rounding routine. Our result,
combined with the algorithm by Naor et al. [FOCS 2011] yields the first deterministic algorithm
for the online node-weighted Steiner tree problem. The resulting competitive ratio is $O(\log
k \cdot \log^2 \ell)$ on graphs of $\ell$ nodes and $k$ terminals.

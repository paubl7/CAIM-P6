The increasing level of marine plastic pollution poses severe threats to the marine ecosystem and
biodiversity. The present study attempted to explore the full functionality of open Sentinel satellite
data and ML models for detecting and classifying floating plastic debris in Mytilene (Greece),
Limassol (Cyprus), Calabria (Italy), and Beirut (Lebanon). Two ML models, i.e. Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and Random Forest (RF) were utilized to carry out the classification analysis. In-situ
plastic location data was collected from the control experiment conducted in Mytilene, Greece
and Limassol, Cyprus, and the same was considered for training the models. Both remote sensing bands
and spectral indices were used for developing the ML models. A spectral signature profile for plastic
was created for discriminating the floating plastic from other marine debris. A newly developed
index, kernel Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (kNDVI), was incorporated into the modelling
to examine its contribution to model performances. Both SVM and RF were performed well in five models
and test case combinations. Among the two ML models, the highest performance was measured for the
RF. The inclusion of kNDVI was found effective and increased the model performances, reflected
by high balanced accuracy measured for model 2 (~80% to ~98 % for SVM and ~87% to ~97 % for RF). Using
the best-performed model, an automated floating plastic detection system was developed and tested
in Calabria and Beirut. For both sites, the trained model had detected the floating plastic with
~99% accuracy. Among the six predictors, the FDI was found the most important variable for detecting
marine floating plastic. These findings collectively suggest that high-resolution remote sensing
imagery and the automated ML models can be an effective alternative for the cost-effective detection
of marine floating plastic.

Recently, deep learning has been widely used in the field of vehicle re-identification. When training
a deep model, softmax loss is usually used as a supervision tool. However, the softmax loss performs
well for closed-set tasks, but not very well for open-set tasks. In this paper, we sum up five shortcomings
of center loss and solved all of them by proposing a dual distance center loss (DDCL). Especially
we solve the shortcoming that center loss must combine with the softmax loss to supervise training
the model, which provides us with a new perspective to examine the center loss. In addition, we verify
the inconsistency between the proposed DDCL and softmax loss in the feature space, which makes the
center loss no longer be limited by the softmax loss in the feature space after removing the softmax
loss. To be specifically, we add the Pearson distance on the basis of the Euclidean distance to the
same center, which makes all features of the same class be confined to the intersection of a hypersphere
and a hypercube in the feature space. The proposed Pearson distance strengthens the intra-class
compactness of the center loss and enhances the generalization ability of center loss. Moreover,
by designing a Euclidean distance threshold between all center pairs, which not only strengthens
the inter-class separability of center loss, but also makes the center loss (or DDCL) works well
without the combination of softmax loss. We apply DDCL in the field of vehicle re-identification
named VeRi-776 dataset and VehicleID dataset. And in order to verify its good generalization ability,
we also verify it in two datasets commonly used in the field of person re-identification named MSMT17
dataset and Market1501 dataset.

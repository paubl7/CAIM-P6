We introduce Neural Marching Cubes (NMC), a data-driven approach for extracting a triangle mesh
from a discretized implicit field. Classical MC is defined by coarse tessellation templates isolated
to individual cubes. While more refined tessellations have been proposed, they all make heuristic
assumptions, such as trilinearity, when determining the vertex positions and local mesh topologies
in each cube. In principle, none of these approaches can reconstruct geometric features that reveal
coherence or dependencies between nearby cubes (e.g., a sharp edge), as such information is unaccounted
for, resulting in poor estimates of the true underlying implicit field. To tackle these challenges,
we re-cast MC from a deep learning perspective, by designing tessellation templates more apt at
preserving geometric features, and learning the vertex positions and mesh topologies from training
meshes, to account for contextual information from nearby cubes. We develop a compact per-cube
parameterization to represent the output triangle mesh, while being compatible with neural processing,
so that a simple 3D convolutional network can be employed for the training. We show that all topological
cases in each cube that are applicable to our design can be easily derived using our representation,
and the resulting tessellations can also be obtained naturally and efficiently by following a few
design guidelines. In addition, our network learns local features with limited receptive fields,
hence it generalizes well to new shapes and new datasets. We evaluate our neural MC approach by quantitative
and qualitative comparisons to all well-known MC variants. In particular, we demonstrate the ability
of our network to recover sharp features such as edges and corners, a long-standing issue of MC and
its variants. Our network also reconstructs local mesh topologies more accurately than previous
approaches.

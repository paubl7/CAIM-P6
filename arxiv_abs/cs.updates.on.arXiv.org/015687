Let $\Lambda(T)$ denote the set of leaves in a tree $T$. One natural problem is to look for a spanning
tree $T$ of a given graph $G$ such that $\Lambda(T)$ is as large as possible. This problem is called
maximum leaf number, and it is a well-known NP-hard problem. Throughout recent decades, this problem
has received considerable attention, ranging from pure graph theoretic questions to practical
problems related to the construction of wireless networks. Recently, a similar but stronger notion
was defined by Bradshaw, Masa\v{r}\'ik, and Stacho [Flexible List Colorings in Graphs with Special
Degeneracy Conditions, ISAAC 2020]. They introduced a new invariant for a graph $G$, called the
robust connectivity and written $\kappa_\rho(G)$, defined as the minimum value $\frac{|R \cap
\Lambda (T)|}{|R|}$ taken over all nonempty subsets $R\subseteq V(G)$, where $T = T(R)$ is a spanning
tree on $G$ chosen to maximize $|R \cap \Lambda(T)|$. Large robust connectivity was originally
used to show flexible choosability in non-regular graphs. In this paper, we investigate some interesting
properties of robust connectivity for graphs embedded in surfaces. We prove a tight asymptotic
bound of $\Omega(\gamma^{-\frac{1}{r}})$ for the robust connectivity of $r$-connected graphs
of Euler genus $\gamma$. Moreover, we give a surprising connection between the robust connectivity
of graphs with an edge-maximal embedding in a surface and the surface connectivity of that surface,
which describes to what extent large induced subgraphs of embedded graphs can be cut out from the
surface without splitting the surface into multiple parts. For planar graphs, this connection
provides an equivalent formulation of a long-standing conjecture of Albertson and Berman [A conjecture
on planar graphs, 1979], which states that every planar graph on $n$ vertices contains an induced
forest of size at least $n/2$.

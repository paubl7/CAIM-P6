Online healthcare communities provide users with various healthcare interventions to promote
healthy behavior and improve adherence. When faced with too many intervention choices, however,
individuals may find it difficult to decide which option to take, especially when they lack the experience
or knowledge to evaluate different options. The choice overload issue may negatively affect users'
engagement in health management. In this study, we take a design-science perspective to propose
a recommendation framework that helps users to select healthcare interventions. Taking into account
that users' health behaviors can be highly dynamic and diverse, we propose a multi-armed bandit
(MAB)-driven recommendation framework, which enables us to adaptively learn users' preference
variations while promoting recommendation diversity in the meantime. To better adapt an MAB to
the healthcare context, we synthesize two innovative model components based on prominent health
theories. The first component is a deep-learning-based feature engineering procedure, which
is designed to learn crucial recommendation contexts in regard to users' sequential health histories,
health-management experiences, preferences, and intrinsic attributes of healthcare interventions.
The second component is a diversity constraint, which structurally diversifies recommendations
in different dimensions to provide users with well-rounded support. We apply our approach to an
online weight management context and evaluate it rigorously through a series of experiments. Our
results demonstrate that each of the design components is effective and that our recommendation
design outperforms a wide range of state-of-the-art recommendation systems. Our study contributes
to the research on the application of business intelligence and has implications for multiple stakeholders,
including online healthcare platforms, policymakers, and users.

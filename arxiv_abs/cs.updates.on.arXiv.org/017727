X-ray imaging in DICOM format is the most commonly used imaging modality in clinical practice, resulting
in vast, non-normalized databases. This leads to an obstacle in deploying AI solutions for analyzing
medical images, which often requires identifying the right body part before feeding the image into
a specified AI model. This challenge raises the need for an automated and efficient approach to classifying
body parts from X-ray scans. Unfortunately, to the best of our knowledge, there is no open tool or
framework for this task to date. To fill this lack, we introduce a DICOM Imaging Router that deploys
deep CNNs for categorizing unknown DICOM X-ray images into five anatomical groups: abdominal,
adult chest, pediatric chest, spine, and others. To this end, a large-scale X-ray dataset consisting
of 16,093 images has been collected and manually classified. We then trained a set of state-of-the-art
deep CNNs using a training set of 11,263 images. These networks were then evaluated on an independent
test set of 2,419 images and showed superior performance in classifying the body parts. Specifically,
our best performing model achieved a recall of 0.982 (95% CI, 0.977-0.988), a precision of 0.985
(95% CI, 0.975-0.989) and a F1-score of 0.981 (95% CI, 0.976-0.987), whilst requiring less computation
for inference (0.0295 second per image). Our external validity on 1,000 X-ray images shows the robustness
of the proposed approach across hospitals. These remarkable performances indicate that deep CNNs
can accurately and effectively differentiate human body parts from X-ray scans, thereby providing
potential benefits for a wide range of applications in clinical settings. The dataset, codes, and
trained deep learning models from this study will be made publicly available on our project website

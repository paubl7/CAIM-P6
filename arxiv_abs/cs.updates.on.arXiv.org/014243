Distributed optimization is often widely attempted and innovated as an attractive and preferred
methodology to solve large-scale problems effectively in a localized and coordinated manner.
Thus along this line, it is noteworthy that the methodology of distributed model predictive control
(DMPC) has become a promising approach to achieve effective outcomes, e.g., in decision-making
tasks for multi-agent systems. However, the typical deployment of such distributed MPC frameworks
would lead to the involvement of nonlinear processes with a large number of nonconvex constraints.
To address this important problem, the development and innovation of a hierarchical three-block
alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach is presented in this work to solve
this nonconvex cooperative DMPC problem in multi-agent systems. Here firstly, an additional slack
variable is introduced to relax the original large-scale nonconvex optimization problem. Then,
a hierarchical ADMM approach, which contains outer loop iteration by the augmented Lagrangian
method (ALM) and inner loop iteration by three-block semi-proximal ADMM, is utilized to solve the
resulting relaxed nonconvex optimization problem. Additionally, it is analytically shown and
established that the requisite desired stationary point exists for the procedures of the hierarchical
stages for convergence in the algorithm. Finally, an approximate optimization stage with a barrier
method is then applied to further significantly improve the computational efficiency, yielding
the final improved hierarchical ADMM. The effectiveness of the proposed method in terms of attained
performance and computational efficiency is demonstrated on a cooperative DMPC problem of decision-making
process for multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).

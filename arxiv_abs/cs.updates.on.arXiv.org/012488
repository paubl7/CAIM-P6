In this work, a modified neural architecture search method (NAS) based physics-informed deep learning
model is presented to solve the groundwater flow problems in porous media. Monte Carlo method based
on a randomized spectral representation is first employed to construct a stochastic model for simulation
of flow through porous media. The desired hydraulic conductivity fields are assumed to be log-normally
distributed with exponential and Gaussian correlations. To analyze the Darcy equation with the
random hydraulic conductivity in this case when its intensity of fluctuations is small, the lowest-order
perturbation theory is used to reduce the difficulty of calculations, by neglecting the higher-order
nonlinear part. To solve the governing equations for groundwater flow problem, we build a modified
NAS model based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with transfer learning in this paper
that will be able to fit different partial differential equations (PDEs) with less calculation.
The performance estimation strategies adopted is constructed from an error estimation model using
the method of manufactured solutions. Since the configuration selection of the neural network
has a strong influence on the simulation results, we apply sensitivity analysis to obtain the prior
knowledge of the PINNs model and narrow down the range of parameters for search space and use hyper-parameter
optimization algorithms to further determine the values of the parameters. Further the NAS based
PINNs model also saves the weights and biases of the most favorable architectures, which is then
used in the fine-tuning process. The proposed NAS model based deep collocation method is verified
to be effective and accurate through numerical examples in different dimensions using different
manufactured solutions.

A wide variety of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) models have recently been proposed to learn
profitable investment strategies. The rules learned by these models outperform the previous strategies
specially in high frequency trading environments. However, it is shown that the quality of the extracted
features from a long-term sequence of raw prices of the instruments greatly affects the performance
of the trading rules learned by these models. Employing a neural encoder-decoder structure to extract
informative features from complex input time-series has proved very effective in other popular
tasks like neural machine translation and video captioning in which the models face a similar problem.
The encoder-decoder framework extracts highly informative features from a long sequence of prices
along with learning how to generate outputs based on the extracted features. In this paper, a novel
end-to-end model based on the neural encoder-decoder framework combined with DRL is proposed to
learn single instrument trading strategies from a long sequence of raw prices of the instrument.
The proposed model consists of an encoder which is a neural structure responsible for learning informative
features from the input sequence, and a decoder which is a DRL model responsible for learning profitable
strategies based on the features extracted by the encoder. The parameters of the encoder and the
decoder structures are learned jointly, which enables the encoder to extract features fitted to
the task of the decoder DRL. In addition, the effects of different structures for the encoder and
various forms of the input sequences on the performance of the learned strategies are investigated.
Experimental results showed that the proposed model outperforms other state-of-the-art models
in highly dynamic environments.

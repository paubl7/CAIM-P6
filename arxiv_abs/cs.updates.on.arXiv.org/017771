In streaming data applications incoming samples are processed and discarded, therefore, intelligent
decision-making is crucial for the performance of lifelong learning systems. In addition, the
order in which samples arrive may heavily affect the performance of online (and offline) incremental
learners. The recently introduced incremental cluster validity indices (iCVIs) provide valuable
aid in addressing such class of problems. Their primary use-case has been cluster quality monitoring;
nonetheless, they have been very recently integrated in a streaming clustering method to assist
the clustering task itself. In this context, the work presented here introduces the first adaptive
resonance theory (ART)-based model that uses iCVIs for unsupervised and semi-supervised online
learning. Moreover, it shows for the first time how to use iCVIs to regulate ART vigilance via an iCVI-based
match tracking mechanism. The model achieves improved accuracy and robustness to ordering effects
by integrating an online iCVI framework as module B of a topological adaptive resonance theory predictive
mapping (TopoARTMAP) -- thereby being named iCVI-TopoARTMAP -- and by employing iCVI-driven post-processing
heuristics at the end of each learning step. The online iCVI framework provides assignments of input
samples to clusters at each iteration in accordance to any of several iCVIs. The iCVI-TopoARTMAP
maintains useful properties shared by ARTMAP models, such as stability, immunity to catastrophic
forgetting, and the many-to-one mapping capability via the map field module. The performance (unsupervised
and semi-supervised) and robustness to presentation order (unsupervised) of iCVI-TopoARTMAP
were evaluated via experiments with a synthetic data set and deep embeddings of a real-world face
image data set.

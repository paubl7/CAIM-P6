The role of symmetry in Boolean functions $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ has been extensively studied
in complexity theory. For example, symmetric functions, that is, functions that are invariant
under the action of $S_n$, is an important class of functions in the study of Boolean functions. A
function $f:\{0,1\}^n \to \{0,1\}$ is called transitive (or weakly-symmetric) if there exists
a transitive group $G$ of $S_n$ such that $f$ is invariant under the action of $G$ - that is the function
value remains unchanged even after the bits of the input of $f$ are moved around according to some
permutation $\sigma \in G$. Understanding various complexity measures of transitive functions
has been a rich area of research for the past few decades. In this work, we study transitive functions
in light of several combinatorial measures. We look at the maximum separation between various pairs
of measures for transitive functions. Such study for general Boolean functions has been going on
for past many years. The best-known results for general Boolean functions have been nicely compiled
by Aaronson et. al (STOC, 2021). The separation between a pair of combinatorial measures is shown
by constructing interesting functions that demonstrate the separation. But many of the celebrated
separation results are via the construction of functions (like "pointer functions" from Ambainis
et al. (JACM, 2017) and "cheat-sheet functions" Aaronson et al. (STOC, 2016)) that are not transitive.
Hence, we don't have such separation between the pairs of measures for transitive functions. In
this paper we show how to modify some of these functions to construct transitive functions that demonstrate
similar separations between pairs of combinatorial measures.

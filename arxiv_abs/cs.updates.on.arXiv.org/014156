Cellular networks have changed the world we are living in, and the fifth generation (5G) of radio
technology is expected to further revolutionise our everyday lives, by enabling a high degree of
automation, through its larger capacity, massive connectivity, and ultra-reliable low latency
communications. In addition, the third generation partnership project (3GPP) new radio (NR) specification
also provides tools to significantly decrease the energy consumption and the green house emissions
of next generations networks, thus contributing towards information and communication technology
(ICT) sustainability targets. In this survey paper, we thoroughly review the state-of-the-art
on current energy efficiency research. We first categorise and carefully analyse the different
power consumption models and energy efficiency metrics, which have helped to make progress on the
understanding of green networks. Then, as a main contribution, we survey in detail -- from a theoretical
and a practical viewpoint -- the main energy efficiency enabling features that 3GPP NR provides,
together with their main benefits and challenges. Special attention is paid to four key technology
features, i.e., massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), lean carrier design, and advanced
idle modes, together with the role of artificial intelligence capabilities. We dive into their
implementation and operational details, and thoroughly discuss their optimal operation points
and theoretical-trade-offs from an energy consumption perspective. This will help the reader
to grasp the fundamentals of -- and the status on -- green networking. Finally, the areas of research
where more effort is needed to make future networks greener are also discussed.

Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communications correspond
to systems whose antenna size is so large that conventional assumptions, such as uniform plane wave
(UPW) impingement, are no longer valid. This paper studies the channel modelling and performance
analysis of XL-MIMO communication based on the generic spherical wavefront propagation model.
First, for the single-user uplink/downlink communication with the optimal maximum ratio combining/transmission
(MRC/MRT), we rigorously derive a new closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR), which includes the conventional SNR expression based on UPW assumption as a special
case. Our result shows that instead of scaling linearly with the base station (BS) antenna number
$M$, the SNR with the more generic spherical wavefront model increases with $M$ with diminishing
return, governed by a new parameter called angular span. One important finding from our derivation
is the necessity to introduce a new distance criterion, termed critical distance, to complement
the classical Rayleigh distance for separating the near- and far-field propagation regions. While
Rayleigh distance is based on the phase difference across array elements and hence depends on the
electrical size of the antenna, the critical distance cares about the amplitude/power difference
and only depends on its physical size. We then extend the study to the multi-user XL-MIMO communication
system, for which we demonstrate that inter-user interference (IUI) can be mitigated not just by
angle separation, but also by distance separation along the same direction. This offers one new
degree of freedom (DoF) for interference suppression with XL-MIMO.

E-commerce business is revolutionizing our shopping experiences by providing convenient and
straightforward services. One of the most fundamental problems is how to balance the demand and
supply in market segments to build an efficient platform. While conventional machine learning
models have achieved great success on data-sufficient segments, it may fail in a large-portion
of segments in E-commerce platforms, where there are not sufficient records to learn well-trained
models. In this paper, we tackle this problem in the context of market segment demand prediction.
The goal is to facilitate the learning process in the target segments by leveraging the learned knowledge
from data-sufficient source segments. Specifically, we propose a novel algorithm, RMLDP, to incorporate
a multi-pattern fusion network (MPFN) with a meta-learning paradigm. The multi-pattern fusion
network considers both local and seasonal temporal patterns for segment demand prediction. In
the meta-learning paradigm, transferable knowledge is regarded as the model parameter initialization
of MPFN, which are learned from diverse source segments. Furthermore, we capture the segment relations
by combining data-driven segment representation and segment knowledge graph representation
and tailor the segment-specific relations to customize transferable model parameter initialization.
Thus, even with limited data, the target segment can quickly find the most relevant transferred
knowledge and adapt to the optimal parameters. We conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale
industrial datasets. The results justify that our RMLDP outperforms a set of state-of-the-art
baselines. Besides, RMLDP has been deployed in Taobao, a real-world E-commerce platform. The online
A/B testing results further demonstrate the practicality of RMLDP.

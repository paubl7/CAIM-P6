Mobile malware are malicious programs that target mobile devices. They are an increasing problem,
as seen in the rise of detected mobile malware samples per year. The number of active smartphone users
is expected to grow, stressing the importance of research on the detection of mobile malware. Detection
methods for mobile malware exist but are still limited. In this paper, we provide an overview of the
performance of machine learning (ML) techniques to detect malware on Android, without using privileged
access. The ML-classifiers use device information such as the CPU usage, battery usage, and memory
usage for the detection of 10 subtypes of Mobile Trojans on the Android Operating System (OS). We
use a real-life dataset containing device and malware data from 47 users for a year (2016). We examine
which features, i.e. aspects, of a device, are most important to monitor to detect (subtypes of)
Mobile Trojans. The focus of this paper is on dynamic hardware features. Using these dynamic features
we apply state-of-the-art machine learning classifiers: Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour,
and AdaBoost. We show classification results on different feature sets, making a distinction between
global device features, and specific app features. None of the measured feature sets require privileged
access. Our results show that the Random Forest classifier performs best as a general malware classifier:
across 10 subtypes of Mobile Trojans, it achieves an F1 score of 0.73 with a False Positive Rate (FPR)
of 0.009 and a False Negative Rate (FNR) of 0.380. The Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbours, and AdaBoost
classifiers achieve F1 scores above 0.72, an FPR below 0.02 and, an FNR below 0.33, when trained separately
to detect each subtype of Mobile Trojans.

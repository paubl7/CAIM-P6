We study the question of dividing a collection of indivisible goods amongst a set of agents. The main
objective of research in the area is to achieve one of two goals: fairness or efficiency. On the fairness
side, envy-freeness is the central fairness criterion in economics, but envy-free allocations
typically do not exist when the goods are indivisible. A recent line of research shows that envy-freeness
can be achieved if a small quantity of a homogeneous divisible good (money) is introduced into the
system, or equivalently, if transfer payments are allowed between the agents. A natural question
to explore, then, is whether transfer payments can be used to provide high welfare in addition to
envy-freeness, and if so, how much money is needed to be transferred. We show that for general monotone
valuations, there always exists an allocation with transfers that is envy-free and whose Nash social
welfare (NSW) is at least an $e^{-1/e}$-fraction of the optimal Nash social welfare. Additionally,
when the agents have additive valuations, an envy-free allocation with negligible transfers and
whose NSW is within a constant factor of optimal can be found in polynomial time. Consequently, we
demonstrate that the seemingly incompatible objectives of fairness and high welfare can be achieved
simultaneously via transfer payments, even for general valuations, when the welfare objective
is NSW. On the other hand, we show that a similar result is impossible for utilitarian social welfare:
any envy-freeable allocation that achieves a constant fraction of the optimal welfare requires
non-negligible transfers. To complement this result we present algorithms that compute an envy-free
allocation with a given target welfare and with bounded transfers.

In this paper, we present Approximation Schemes for Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP)
on several classes of graphs. In CVRP, introduced by Dantzig and Ramser (1959), we are given a graph
$G=(V,E)$ with metric edges costs, a depot $r\in V$, and a vehicle of bounded capacity $Q$. The goal
is to find minimum cost collection of tours for the vehicle that returns to the depot, each visiting
at most $Q$ nodes, such that they cover all the nodes. This generalizes classic TSP and has been studied
extensively. In the more general setting, each node $v$ has a demand $d_v$ and the total demand of
each tour must be no more than $Q$. Either the demand of each node must be served by one tour (unsplittable)
or can be served by multiple tour (splittable). The best known approximation algorithm for general
graphs has ratio $\alpha+2(1-\epsilon)$ (for the unsplittable) and $\alpha+1-\epsilon$ (for
the splittable) for some fixed $\epsilon>\frac{1}{3000}$, where $\alpha$ is the best approximation
for TSP. Even for the case of trees, the best approximation ratio is $4/3$ by Becker (2018) and it has
been an open question if there is an approximation scheme for this simple class of graphs. Das and
Mathieu (2015) presented an approximation scheme with time $n^{\log^{O(1/\epsilon)}n}$ for
Euclidean plane $\mathbb{R}^2$. No other approximation scheme is known for any other class of metrics
(without further restrictions on $Q$). In this paper, we make significant progress on this classic
problem by presenting Quasi-Polynomial Time Approximation Schemes (QPTAS) for graphs of bounded
treewidth, graphs of bounded highway dimensions, and graphs of bounded doubling dimensions. For
comparison, our result implies an approximation scheme for Euclidean plane with run time $n^{O(\log^{10}n/\epsilon^{9})}$.

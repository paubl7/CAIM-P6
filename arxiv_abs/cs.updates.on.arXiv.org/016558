Problems of satisfiability and resiliency in workflows have been widely studied in the last decade.
Recent work has shown that many such problems may be viewed as special cases of the authorization
policy existence problem (APEP), which returns an authorization policy if one exists and 'No' otherwise.
A solution may not exist because of the restrictions imposed by the base authorization relation
and constraints that form part of the input to APEP. However, in many practical settings it would
be more useful to obtain a 'least bad' policy than just a 'No', where 'least bad' is characterized
by some numerical value associated with the policy indicating the extent to which the policy violates
the base authorization relation and constraints. Accordingly, we introduce the Valued APEP, which
returns an authorization policy of minimum weight, where the (non-negative) weight is determined
by the constraints violated by the returned solution (and is 0 if all constraints are satisfied).
We then establish a number of results concerning the parameterized complexity of Valued APEP. We
prove that the problem is fixed-parameter tractable if the set of constraints satisfies two restrictions,
but is intractable if only one of these restrictions holds. (Most constraints known to be of practical
use satisfy these restrictions.) We introduce the notion of a user profile for a weighted constraint,
which enables us to prove a powerful result, a corollary of which improves on known complexity results
for APEP. Finally, we consider Valued APEP when restricted to particular sub-classes of constraints
and show that instances of such problems can be reduced to the Valued WSP, enabling us to exploit known
algorithms to solve these particular instances.

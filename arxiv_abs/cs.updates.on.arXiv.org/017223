Background: In recent years, Low-code development (LCD) is growing rapidly, and Gartner and Forrester
have predicted that the use of LCD is very promising. Giant companies, such as Microsoft, Mendix,
and Outsystems have also launched their LCD platforms. Aim: In this work, we explored two popular
online developer communities, Stack Overflow (SO) and Reddit, to provide insights on the characteristics
and challenges of LCD from a practitioners' perspective. Method: We used two LCD related terms to
search the relevant posts in SO and extracted 73 posts. Meanwhile, we explored three LCD related
subreddits from Reddit and collected 228 posts. We extracted data from these posts and applied the
Constant Comparison method to analyze the descriptions, benefits, and limitations and challenges
of LCD. For platforms and programming languages used in LCD, implementation units in LCD, supporting
technologies of LCD, types of applications developed by LCD, and domains that use LCD, we used descriptive
statistics to analyze and present the results. Results: Our findings show that: (1) LCD may provide
a graphical user interface for users to drag and drop with little or even no code; (2) the equipment
of out-of-the-box units (e.g., APIs and components) in LCD platforms makes them easy to learn and
use as well as speeds up the development; (3) LCD is particularly favored in the domains that have
the need for automated processes and workflows; and (4) practitioners have conflicting views on
the advantages and disadvantages of LCD. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that researchers should
clearly define the terms when they refer to LCD, and developers should consider whether the characteristics
of LCD are appropriate for their projects.

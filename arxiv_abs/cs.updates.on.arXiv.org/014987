Assessing and selecting the most viable embryos for transfer is an essential part of in vitro fertilization
(IVF). In recent years, several approaches have been made to improve and automate the procedure
using artificial intelligence (AI) and deep learning. Based on images of embryos with known implantation
data (KID), AI models have been trained to automatically score embryos related to their chance of
achieving a successful implantation. However, as of now, only limited research has been conducted
to evaluate how embryo selection models generalize to new clinics and how they perform in subgroup
analyses across various conditions. In this paper, we investigate how a deep learning-based embryo
selection model using only time-lapse image sequences performs across different patient ages
and clinical conditions, and how it correlates with traditional morphokinetic parameters. The
model was trained and evaluated based on a large dataset from 18 IVF centers consisting of 115,832
embryos, of which 14,644 embryos were transferred KID embryos. In an independent test set, the AI
model sorted KID embryos with an area under the curve (AUC) of a receiver operating characteristic
curve of 0.67 and all embryos with an AUC of 0.95. A clinic hold-out test showed that the model generalized
to new clinics with an AUC range of 0.60-0.75 for KID embryos. Across different subgroups of age,
insemination method, incubation time, and transfer protocol, the AUC ranged between 0.63 and 0.69.
Furthermore, model predictions correlated positively with blastocyst grading and negatively
with direct cleavages. The fully automated iDAScore v1.0 model was shown to perform at least as good
as a state-of-the-art manual embryo selection model. Moreover, full automatization of embryo
scoring implies fewer manual evaluations and eliminates biases due to inter- and intraobserver
variation.

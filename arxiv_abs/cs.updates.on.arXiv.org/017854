Multivariate time series (MTS) prediction plays a key role in many fields such as finance, energy
and transport, where each individual time series corresponds to the data collected from a certain
data source, so-called channel. A typical pipeline of building an MTS prediction model (PM) consists
of selecting a subset of channels among all available ones, extracting features from the selected
channels, and building a PM based on the extracted features, where each component involves certain
optimization tasks, i.e., selection of channels, feature extraction (FE) methods, and PMs as well
as configuration of the selected FE method and PM. Accordingly, pursuing the best prediction performance
corresponds to optimizing the pipeline by solving all of its involved optimization problems. This
is a non-trivial task due to the vastness of the solution space. Different from most of the existing
works which target at optimizing certain components of the pipeline, we propose a novel evolutionary
ensemble learning framework to optimize the entire pipeline in a holistic manner. In this framework,
a specific pipeline is encoded as a candidate solution and a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm
is applied under different population sizes to produce multiple Pareto optimal sets (POSs). Finally,
selective ensemble learning is designed to choose the optimal subset of solutions from the POSs
and combine them to yield final prediction by using greedy sequential selection and least square
methods. We implement the proposed framework and evaluate our implementation on two real-world
applications, i.e., electricity consumption prediction and air quality prediction. The performance
comparison with state-of-the-art techniques demonstrates the superiority of the proposed approach.

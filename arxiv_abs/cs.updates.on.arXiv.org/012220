This work focuses on the following question related to the Gathering problem of $n$ autonomous,
mobile robots in the Euclidean plane: Is it possible to solve Gathering of robots that do not agree
on any axis of their coordinate systems (disoriented robots) and see other robots only up to a constant
distance (limited visibility) in $o(n^2)$ fully synchronous rounds? The best known algorithm
that solves Gathering of disoriented robots with limited visibility assuming oblivious robots
needs $\Theta(n^2)$ rounds [SPAA'11]. The lower bound for this algorithm even holds in a simplified
closed chain model, where each robot has exactly two neighbors and the chain connections form a cycle.
The only existing algorithms achieving a linear number of rounds for disoriented robots assume
robots that are located on a two dimensional grid [IPDPS'16] and [SPAA'16]. Both algorithms make
use of locally visible lights (the LUMINOUS model). In this work, we show for the closed chain model,
that $n$ disoriented robots with limited visibility in the Euclidean plane can be gathered in $\Theta\left(n\right)$
rounds assuming the LUMINOUS model. The lights are used to initiate and perform so-called runs along
the chain. For the start of such runs, locally unique robots need to be determined. In contrast to
the grid [IPDPS'16], this is not possible in every configuration in the Euclidean plane. Based on
the theory of isogonal polygons by Gr\"unbaum, we identify the class of isogonal configurations
in which no such locally unique robots can be identified. Our solution combines two algorithms:
The first one gathers isogonal configurations; it works without any lights. The second one works
for non-isogonal configurations; it identifies locally unique robots to start runs, using a constant
number of lights. Interleaving these algorithms solves the Gathering problem in $\mathcal{O}(n)$
rounds.

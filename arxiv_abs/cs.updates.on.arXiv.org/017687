Background: Social media chatter in 2020 has been largely dominated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Existing
research shows that COVID-19 discourse is highly politicized, with political preferences linked
to beliefs and disbeliefs about the virus. As it happens with topics that become politicized, people
may fall into echo chambers, which is the idea that one is only presented with information they already
agree with, thereby reinforcing one's confirmation bias. Understanding the relationship between
information dissemination and political preference is crucial for effective public health communication.
Objective: We aimed to study the extent of polarization and examine the structure of echo chambers
related to COVID-19 discourse on Twitter in the United States. Methods: First, we presented Retweet-BERT,
a scalable and highly accurate model for estimating user polarity by leveraging language features
and network structures. Then, by analyzing the user polarity predicted by Retweet-BERT, we provided
new insights into the characterization of partisan users. Results: We observed that right-leaning
users were noticeably more vocal and active in the production and consumption of COVID-19 information.
We also found that most of the highly influential users were partisan, which may contribute to further
polarization. Importantly, while echo chambers exist in both the right- and left-leaning communities,
the right-leaning community was by far more densely connected within their echo chamber and isolated
from the rest. Conclusions: We provided empirical evidence that political echo chambers are prevalent,
especially in the right-leaning community, which can exacerbate the exposure to information in
line with pre-existing users' views. Our findings have broader implications in developing effective
public health campaigns and promoting the circulation of factual information online.

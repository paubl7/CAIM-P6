Context: Software security patch management purports to support the process of patching known
software security vulnerabilities. Given the increasing recognition of the importance of software
security patch management, it is important and timely to systematically review and synthesise
the relevant literature on this topic. Objective: This paper aims at systematically reviewing
the state of the art of software security patch management to identify the socio-technical challenges
in this regard, reported solutions (i.e., approaches, tools, and practices), the rigour of the
evaluation and the industrial relevance of the reported solutions, and to identify the gaps for
future research. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review of 72 studies published from
2002 to March 2020, with extended coverage until September 2020 through forward snowballing. Results:
We identify 14 socio-technical challenges, 18 solution approaches, tools and practices mapped
onto the software security patch management process. We provide a mapping between the solutions
and challenges to enable a reader to obtain a holistic overview of the gap areas. The findings also
reveal that only 20.8% of the reported solutions have been rigorously evaluated in industrial settings.
Conclusion: Our results reveal that 50% of the common challenges have not been directly addressed
in the solutions and that most of them (38.9%) address the challenges in one phase of the process,
namely vulnerability scanning, assessment and prioritisation. Based on the results that highlight
the important concerns in software security patch management and the lack of solutions, we recommend
a list of future research directions. This study also provides useful insights about different
opportunities for practitioners to adopt new solutions and understand the variations of their
practical utility.

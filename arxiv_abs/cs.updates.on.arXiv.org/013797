In recent years, the abuse of a face swap technique called deepfake Deepfake has raised enormous
public concerns. So far, a large number of deepfake videos (known as "deepfakes") have been crafted
and uploaded to the internet, calling for effective countermeasures. One promising countermeasure
against deepfakes is deepfake detection. Several deepfake datasets have been released to support
the training and testing of deepfake detectors, such as DeepfakeDetection and FaceForensics++.
While this has greatly advanced deepfake detection, most of the real videos in these datasets are
filmed with a few volunteer actors in limited scenes, and the fake videos are crafted by researchers
using a few popular deepfake softwares. Detectors developed on these datasets may become less effective
against real-world deepfakes on the internet. To better support detection against real-world
deepfakes, in this paper, we introduce a new dataset WildDeepfake, which consists of 7,314 face
sequences extracted from 707 deepfake videos collected completely from the internet. WildDeepfake
is a small dataset that can be used, in addition to existing datasets, to develop and test the effectiveness
of deepfake detectors against real-world deepfakes. We conduct a systematic evaluation of a set
of baseline detection networks on both existing and our WildDeepfake datasets, and show that WildDeepfake
is indeed a more challenging dataset, where the detection performance can decrease drastically.
We also propose two (eg. 2D and 3D) Attention-based Deepfake Detection Networks (ADDNets) to leverage
the attention masks on real/fake faces for improved detection. We empirically verify the effectiveness
of ADDNets on both existing datasets and WildDeepfake. The dataset is available at:https://github.com/deepfakeinthewild/deepfake-in-the-wild.

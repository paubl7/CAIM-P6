In the hyperbolic community, discontinuous Galerkin approaches are mainly applied when finite
element methods are considered. As the name suggested, the DG framework allows a discontinuity
at the element interfaces, which seems for many researchers a favorable property in case of hyperbolic
balance laws. On the contrary, continuous Galerkin method obtained from a straightforward discretisation
of the weak form of the PDEs appear to be unsuitable for hyperbolic problems. To remedy this issue,
stabilization terms are usually added and various formulations can be found in the literature.
There exists still the perception that continuous Galerkin methods are not suited to hyperbolic
problems, and the reason of this is the continuity of the approximation. However, this perception
is not true and the stabilization terms can be removed, in general, provided the boundary conditions
are suitable. In this paper, we deal with this problem, and present a different approach. We use the
boundary conditions to stabilize the scheme following a procedure that are frequently used in the
finite difference community. Here, the main idea is to impose the boundary conditions weakly and
specific boundary operators are constructed such that they guarantee stability. This approach
has already been used in the DG framework, but here we apply it with a continuous Galerkin scheme.
No internal dissipation is needed even if unstructured grids are used. Further, we point out that
we do not need exact integration, it suffices if the quadrature rule and the norm in the differential
operator are the same, such that the summation-by-parts (SBP) property is fulfilled meaning that
a discrete Gauss Th. is valid. This contradicts the perception in the hyperbolic community that
stability issues for pure Galerkin scheme exist. In numerical simulations, we verify our theoretical
analysis.

Our concern is the problem of efficiently determining the data complexity of answering queries
mediated by description logic ontologies and constructing their optimal rewritings to standard
database queries. Originated in ontology-based data access and datalog optimisation, this problem
is known to be computationally very complex in general, with no explicit syntactic characterisations
available. In this article, aiming to understand the fundamental roots of this difficulty, we strip
the problem to the bare bones and focus on Boolean conjunctive queries mediated by a simple covering
axiom stating that one class is covered by the union of two other classes. We show that, on the one hand,
these rudimentary ontology-mediated queries, called disjunctive sirups (or d-sirups), capture
many features and difficulties of the general case. For example, answering d-sirups is Pi^p_2-complete
for combined complexity and can be in AC0 or LogSpace-, NL-, P-, or coNP-complete for data complexity
(with the problem of recognising FO-rewritability of d-sirups being 2ExpTime-hard); some d-sirups
only have exponential-size resolution proofs, some only double-exponential-size positive existential
FO-rewritings and single-exponential-size nonrecursive datalog rewritings. On the other hand,
we prove a few partial sufficient and necessary conditions of FO- and (symmetric/linear-) datalog
rewritability of d-sirups. Our main technical result is a complete and transparent syntactic AC0/NL/P/coNP
tetrachotomy of d-sirups with disjoint covering classes and a path-shaped Boolean conjunctive
query. To obtain this tetrachotomy, we develop new techniques for establishing P- and coNP-hardness
of answering non-Horn ontology-mediated queries as well as showing that they can be answered in
NL.

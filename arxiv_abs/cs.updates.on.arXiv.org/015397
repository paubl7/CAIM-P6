Current limitations in boosted tree modelling prevent the effective scaling to datasets with a
large feature number, particularly when investigating the magnitude and directionality of various
features on classification. We present a novel methodology, Hollow-tree Super (HOTS), to resolve
and visualize feature importance in boosted tree models involving a large number of features. Further,
HOTS allows for investigation of the directionality and magnitude various features have on classification.
Using the Iris dataset, we first compare HOTS to Gini Importance, Partial Dependence Plots, and
Permutation Importance, and demonstrate how HOTS resolves the weaknesses present in these methods.
We then show how HOTS can be utilized in high dimensional neuroscientific data, by taking 60 Schizophrenic
subjects and applying the method to determine which brain regions were most important for classification
of schizophrenia as determined by the PANSS. HOTS effectively replicated and supported the findings
of Gini importance, Partial Dependence Plots and Permutation importance within the Iris dataset.
When applied to the schizophrenic brain dataset, HOTS was able to resolve the top 10 most important
features for classification, as well as their directionality for classification and magnitude
compared to other features. Cross-validation supported that these same 10 features were consistently
used in the decision-making process across multiple trees, and these features were localised primarily
to the occipital and parietal cortices, commonly disturbed brain regions in those with Schizophrenia.
It is imperative that a methodology is developed that is able to handle the demands of working with
large datasets that contain a large number of features. HOTS represents a unique way to investigate
both the directionality and magnitude of feature importance when working at scale with boosted-tree
modelling.

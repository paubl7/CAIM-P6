Objective: We develop a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system using deep learning approaches
for lesion detection and classification on whole-slide images (WSIs) with breast cancer. The deep
features being distinguishing in classification from the convolutional neural networks (CNN)
are demonstrated in this study to provide comprehensive interpretability for the proposed CAD
system using pathological knowledge. Methods: In the experiment, a total of 186 slides of WSIs were
collected and classified into three categories: Non-Carcinoma, Ductal Carcinoma in Situ (DCIS),
and Invasive Ductal Carcinoma (IDC). Instead of conducting pixel-wise classification into three
classes directly, we designed a hierarchical framework with the multi-view scheme that performs
lesion detection for region proposal at higher magnification first and then conducts lesion classification
at lower magnification for each detected lesion. Results: The slide-level accuracy rate for three-category
classification reaches 90.8% (99/109) through 5-fold cross-validation and achieves 94.8% (73/77)
on the testing set. The experimental results show that the morphological characteristics and co-occurrence
properties learned by the deep learning models for lesion classification are accordant with the
clinical rules in diagnosis. Conclusion: The pathological interpretability of the deep features
not only enhances the reliability of the proposed CAD system to gain acceptance from medical specialists,
but also facilitates the development of deep learning frameworks for various tasks in pathology.
Significance: This paper presents a CAD system for pathological image analysis, which fills the
clinical requirements and can be accepted by medical specialists with providing its interpretability
from the pathological perspective.

We present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) Regularized Deep Learning (EMReDL) model for the
weakly supervised tumor segmentation. The proposed framework was tailored to glioblastoma, a
type of malignant tumor characterized by its diffuse infiltration into the surrounding brain tissue,
which poses significant challenge to treatment target and tumor burden estimation based on conventional
structural MRI. Although physiological MRI can provide more specific information regarding tumor
infiltration, the relatively low resolution hinders a precise full annotation. This has motivated
us to develop a weakly supervised deep learning solution that exploits the partial labelled tumor
regions. EMReDL contains two components: a physiological prior prediction model and EM-regularized
segmentation model. The physiological prior prediction model exploits the physiological MRI
by training a classifier to generate a physiological prior map. This map was passed to the segmentation
model for regularization using the EM algorithm. We evaluated the model on a glioblastoma dataset
with the available pre-operative multiparametric MRI and recurrence MRI. EMReDL was shown to effectively
segment the infiltrated tumor from the partially labelled region of potential infiltration. The
segmented core and infiltrated tumor showed high consistency with the tumor burden labelled by
experts. The performance comparison showed that EMReDL achieved higher accuracy than published
state-of-the-art models. On MR spectroscopy, the segmented region showed more aggressive features
than other partial labelled region. The proposed model can be generalized to other segmentation
tasks with partial labels, with the CNN architecture flexible in the framework.

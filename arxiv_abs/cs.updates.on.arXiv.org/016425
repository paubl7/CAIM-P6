We study the power and limitations of component-stable algorithms in the low-space model of Massively
Parallel Computation (MPC). Recently Ghaffari, Kuhn and Uitto (FOCS 2019) introduced the class
of component-stable low-space MPC algorithms, which are, informally, defined as algorithms for
which the outputs reported by the nodes in different connected components are required to be independent.
This very natural notion was introduced to capture most (if not all) of the known efficient MPC algorithms
to date, and it was the first general class of MPC algorithms for which one can show non-trivial conditional
lower bounds. In this paper we enhance the framework of component-stable algorithms and investigate
its effect on the complexity of randomized and deterministic low-space MPC. Our key contributions
include: 1) We revise and formalize the lifting approach of Ghaffari, Kuhn and Uitto. This requires
a very delicate amendment of the notion of component stability, which allows us to fill in gaps in
the earlier arguments. 2) We also extend the framework to obtain conditional lower bounds for deterministic
algorithms and fine-grained lower bounds that depend on the maximum degree $\Delta$. 3) We demonstrate
a collection of natural graph problems for which non-component-stable algorithms break the conditional
lower bound obtained for component-stable algorithms. This implies that, for both deterministic
and randomized algorithms, component-stable algorithms are conditionally weaker than the non-component-stable
ones. Altogether our results imply that component-stability might limit the computational power
of the low-space MPC model, at least in certain contexts, paving the way for improved upper bounds
that escape the conditional lower bound setting of Ghaffari, Kuhn, and Uitto.

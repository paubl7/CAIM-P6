Optimism about the Internet's potential to bring the world together has been tempered by concerns
about its role in inflaming the 'culture wars'. Via mass selection into like-minded groups, online
society may be becoming more fragmented and polarized, particularly with respect to partisan differences.
However, our ability to measure the social makeup of online communities, and in turn understand
the social organization of online platforms, is limited by the pseudonymous, unstructured, and
large-scale nature of digital discussion. We develop a neural embedding methodology to quantify
the positioning of online communities along social dimensions by leveraging large-scale patterns
of aggregate behaviour. Applying our methodology to 5.1B Reddit comments made in 10K communities
over 14 years, we measure how the macroscale community structure is organized with respect to age,
gender, and U.S. political partisanship. Examining political content, we find Reddit underwent
a significant polarization event around the 2016 U.S. presidential election, and remained highly
polarized for years afterward. Contrary to conventional wisdom, however, individual-level polarization
is rare; the system-level shift in 2016 was disproportionately driven by the arrival of new and newly
political users. Political polarization on Reddit is unrelated to previous activity on the platform,
and is instead temporally aligned with external events. We also observe a stark ideological asymmetry,
with the sharp increase in 2016 being entirely attributable to changes in right-wing activity.
Our methodology is broadly applicable to the study of online interaction, and our findings have
implications for the design of online platforms, understanding the social contexts of online behaviour,
and quantifying the dynamics and mechanisms of online polarization.

Privacy by Design (PbD) is the most common approach followed by software developers who aim to reduce
risks within their application designs, yet it remains commonplace for developers to retain little
conceptual understanding of what is meant by privacy. A vision is to develop an intelligent privacy
assistant to whom developers can easily ask questions in order to learn how to incorporate different
privacy-preserving ideas into their IoT application designs. This paper lays the foundations
toward developing such a privacy assistant by synthesising existing PbD knowledge so as to elicit
requirements. It is believed that such a privacy assistant should not just prescribe a list of privacy-preserving
ideas that developers should incorporate into their design. Instead, it should explain how each
prescribed idea helps to protect privacy in a given application design context-this approach is
defined as 'Explainable Privacy'. A total of 74 privacy patterns were analysed and reviewed using
ten different PbD schemes to understand how each privacy pattern is built and how each helps to ensure
privacy. Due to page limitations, we have presented a detailed analysis in [3]. In addition, different
real-world Internet of Things (IoT) use-cases, including a healthcare application, were used
to demonstrate how each privacy pattern could be applied to a given application design. By doing
so, several knowledge engineering requirements were identified that need to be considered when
developing a privacy assistant. It was also found that, when compared to other IoT application domains,
privacy patterns can significantly benefit healthcare applications. In conclusion, this paper
identifies the research challenges that must be addressed if one wishes to construct an intelligent
privacy assistant that can truly augment software developers' capabilities at the design phase.

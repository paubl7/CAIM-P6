Hexahedral meshes are an ubiquitous domain for the numerical resolution of partial differential
equations. Computing a pure hexahedral mesh from an adaptively refined grid is a prominent approach
to automatic hexmeshing, and requires the ability to restore the all hex property around the hanging
nodes that arise at the interface between cells having different size. The most advanced tools to
accomplish this task are based on mesh dualization. These approaches use topological schemes to
regularize the valence of inner vertices and edges, such that dualizing the grid yields a pure hexahedral
mesh. In this paper we study in detail the dual approach, and propose four main contributions to it:
(i) we enumerate all the possible transitions that dual methods must be able to handle, showing that
prior schemes do not natively cover all of them; (ii) we show that schemes are internally asymmetric,
therefore not only their implementation is ambiguous, but different implementation choices lead
to hexahedral meshes with different singular structure; (iii) we explore the combinatorial space
of dual schemes, selecting the minimum set that covers all the possible configurations and also
yields the simplest singular structure in the output hexmesh; (iv) we enlarge the class of adaptive
grids that can be transformed into pure hexahedral meshes, relaxing one of the tight requirements
imposed by previous approaches, and ultimately permitting to obtain much coarser meshes for same
geometric accuracy. Last but not least, for the first time we make grid-based hexmeshing truly reproducible,
releasing our code and also revealing a conspicuous amount of technical details that were always
overlooked in previous literature, creating an entry barrier that was hard to overcome for practitioners
in the field.

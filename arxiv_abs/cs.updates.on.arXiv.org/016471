Less than 35% of recyclable waste is being actually recycled in the US, which leads to increased soil
and sea pollution and is one of the major concerns of environmental researchers as well as the common
public. At the heart of the problem is the inefficiencies of the waste sorting process (separating
paper, plastic, metal, glass, etc.) due to the extremely complex and cluttered nature of the waste
stream. Automated waste detection strategies have a great potential to enable more efficient,
reliable and safer waste sorting practices, but the literature lacks comprehensive datasets and
methodology for the industrial waste sorting solutions. In this paper, we take a step towards computer-aided
waste detection and present the first in-the-wild industrial-grade waste detection and segmentation
dataset, ZeroWaste. This dataset contains over1800fully segmented video frames collected from
a real waste sorting plant along with waste material labels for training and evaluation of the segmentation
methods, as well as over6000unlabeled frames that can be further used for semi-supervised and self-supervised
learning techniques. ZeroWaste also provides frames of the conveyor belt before and after the sorting
process, comprising a novel setup that can be used for weakly-supervised segmentation. We present
baselines for fully-, semi- and weakly-supervised segmentation methods. Our experimental results
demonstrate that state-of-the-art segmentation methods struggle to correctly detect and classify
target objects which suggests the challenging nature of our proposed in-the-wild dataset. We believe
that ZeroWastewill catalyze research in object detection and semantic segmentation in extreme
clutter as well as applications in the recycling domain. Our project page can be found atthis http

Genomic Epidemiology (genEpi) is a branch of public health that uses many different data types including
tabular, network, genomic, and geographic, to identify and contain outbreaks of deadly diseases.
Due to the volume and variety of data, it is challenging for genEpi domain experts to conduct data
reconnaissance; that is, have an overview of the data they have and make assessments toward its quality,
completeness, and suitability. We present an algorithm for data reconnaissance through automatic
visualization recommendation, GEViTRec. Our approach handles a broad variety of dataset types
and automatically generates coordinated combinations of charts, in contrast to existing systems
that primarily focus on singleton visual encodings of tabular datasets. We automatically detect
linkages across multiple input datasets by analyzing non-numeric attribute fields, creating
an entity graph within which we analyze and rank paths. For each high-ranking path, we specify chart
combinations with spatial and color alignments between shared fields, using a gradual binding
approach to transform initial partial specifications of singleton charts to complete specifications
that are aligned and oriented consistently. A novel aspect of our approach is its combination of
domain-agnostic elements with domain-specific information that is captured through a domain-specific
visualization prevalence design space. Our implementation is applied to both synthetic data and
real data from an Ebola outbreak. We compare GEViTRec's output to what previous visualization recommendation
systems would generate, and to manually crafted visualizations used by practitioners. We conducted
formative evaluations with ten genEpi experts to assess the relevance and interpretability of
our results.

True random number generators (TRNG) sample random physical processes to create large amounts
of random numbers for various use cases, including security-critical cryptographic primitives,
scientific simulations, machine learning applications, and even recreational entertainment.
Unfortunately, not every computing system is equipped with dedicated TRNG hardware, limiting
the application space and security guarantees for such systems. To open the application space and
enable security guarantees for the overwhelming majority of computing systems that do not necessarily
have dedicated TRNG hardware, we develop QUAC-TRNG. QUAC-TRNG exploits the new observation that
a carefully-engineered sequence of DRAM commands activates four consecutive DRAM rows in rapid
succession. This QUadruple ACtivation (QUAC) causes the bitline sense amplifiers to non-deterministically
converge to random values when we activate four rows that store conflicting data because the net
deviation in bitline voltage fails to meet reliable sensing margins. We experimentally demonstrate
that QUAC reliably generates random values across 136 commodity DDR4 DRAM chips from one major DRAM
manufacturer. We describe how to develop an effective TRNG (QUAC-TRNG) based on QUAC. We evaluate
the quality of our TRNG using NIST STS and find that QUAC-TRNG successfully passes each test. Our
experimental evaluations show that QUAC-TRNG generates true random numbers with a throughput
of 3.44 Gb/s (per DRAM channel), outperforming the state-of-the-art DRAM-based TRNG by 15.08x
and 1.41x for basic and throughput-optimized versions, respectively. We show that QUAC-TRNG utilizes
DRAM bandwidth better than the state-of-the-art, achieving up to 2.03x the throughput of a throughput-optimized
baseline when scaling bus frequencies to 12 GT/s.

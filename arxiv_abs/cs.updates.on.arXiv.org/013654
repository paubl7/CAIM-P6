The theory of majorizing measures, extensively developed by Fernique, Talagrand and many others,
provides one of the most general frameworks for controlling the behavior of stochastic processes.
In particular, it can be applied to derive quantitative bounds on the expected suprema and the degree
of continuity of sample paths for many processes. One of the crowning achievements of the theory
is Talagrand's tight alternative characterization of the suprema of Gaussian processes in terms
of majorizing measures. The proof of this theorem was difficult, and thus considerable effort was
put into the task of developing both shorter and easier to understand proofs. A major reason for this
difficulty was considered to be theory of majorizing measures itself, which had the reputation
of being opaque and mysterious. As a consequence, most recent treatments of the theory (including
by Talagrand himself) have eschewed the use of majorizing measures in favor of a purely combinatorial
approach (the generic chaining) where objects based on sequences of partitions provide roughly
matching upper and lower bounds on the desired expected supremum. In this paper, we return to majorizing
measures as a primary object of study, and give a viewpoint that we think is natural and clarifying
from an optimization perspective. As our main contribution, we give an algorithmic proof of the
majorizing measures theorem based on two parts: (1) We make the simple (but apparently new) observation
that finding the best majorizing measure can be cast as a convex program. This also allows for efficiently
computing the measure using off-the-shelf methods from convex optimization. (2) We obtain tree-based
upper and lower bound certificates by rounding, in a series of steps, the primal and dual solutions
to this convex program. [...]

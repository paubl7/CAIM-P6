Anonymization and data sharing are crucial for privacy protection and acquisition of large datasets
for medical image analysis. This is a big challenge, especially for neuroimaging. Here, the brain's
unique structure allows for re-identification and thus requires non-conventional anonymization.
Generative adversarial networks (GANs) have the potential to provide anonymous images while preserving
predictive properties. Analyzing brain vessel segmentation, we trained 3 GANs on time-of-flight
(TOF) magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) patches for image-label generation: 1) Deep convolutional
GAN, 2) Wasserstein-GAN with gradient penalty (WGAN-GP) and 3) WGAN-GP with spectral normalization
(WGAN-GP-SN). The generated image-labels from each GAN were used to train a U-net for segmentation
and tested on real data. Moreover, we applied our synthetic patches using transfer learning on a
second dataset. For an increasing number of up to 15 patients we evaluated the model performance
on real data with and without pre-training. The performance for all models was assessed by the Dice
Similarity Coefficient (DSC) and the 95th percentile of the Hausdorff Distance (95HD). Comparing
the 3 GANs, the U-net trained on synthetic data generated by the WGAN-GP-SN showed the highest performance
to predict vessels (DSC/95HD 0.82/28.97) benchmarked by the U-net trained on real data (0.89/26.61).
The transfer learning approach showed superior performance for the same GAN compared to no pre-training,
especially for one patient only (0.91/25.68 vs. 0.85/27.36). In this work, synthetic image-label
pairs retained generalizable information and showed good performance for vessel segmentation.
Besides, we showed that synthetic patches can be used in a transfer learning approach with independent
data. This paves the way to overcome the challenges of scarce data and anonymization in medical imaging.

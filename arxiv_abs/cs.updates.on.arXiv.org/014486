Agile attitude maneuvering maximizes the utility of remote sensing satellite constellations.
By taking into account a satellite's physical properties and its actuator specifications, we may
leverage the full performance potential of the attitude control system to conduct agile remote
sensing beyond conventional slew-and-stabilize maneuvers. Employing a constellation of agile
satellites, coordinated by an autonomous and responsive scheduler, can significantly increase
overall response rate, revisit time and global coverage for the mission. In this paper, we use recent
advances in sequential convex programming based trajectory optimization to enable rapid-target
acquisition, pointing and tracking capabilities for a scheduler-based constellation. We present
two problem formulations. The Minimum-Time Slew Optimal Control Problem determines the minimum
time, required energy, and optimal trajectory to slew between any two orientations given nonlinear
quaternion kinematics, gyrostat and actuator dynamics, and state/input constraints. By gridding
the space of 3D rotations and efficiently solving this problem on the grid, we produce lookup tables
or parametric fits off-line that can then be used on-line by a scheduler to compute accurate estimates
of minimum-time and maneuver energy for real-time constellation scheduling. The Minimum-Effort
Multi-Target Pointing Optimal Control Problem is used on-line by each satellite to produce continuous
attitude-state and control-input trajectories that realize a given schedule while minimizing
attitude error and control effort. The optimal trajectory may then be achieved by a low-level tracking
controller. We demonstrate our approach with an example of a reference satellite in Sun-synchronous
orbit passing over globally-distributed, Earth-observation targets.

In this paper, we address the makeup transfer and removal tasks simultaneously, which aim to transfer
the makeup from a reference image to a source image and remove the makeup from the with-makeup image
respectively. Existing methods have achieved much advancement in constrained scenarios, but
it is still very challenging for them to transfer makeup between images with large pose and expression
differences, or handle makeup details like blush on cheeks or highlight on the nose. In addition,
they are hardly able to control the degree of makeup during transferring or to transfer a specified
part in the input face. In this work, we propose the PSGAN++, which is capable of performing both detail-preserving
makeup transfer and effective makeup removal. For makeup transfer, PSGAN++ uses a Makeup Distill
Network to extract makeup information, which is embedded into spatial-aware makeup matrices.
We also devise an Attentive Makeup Morphing module that specifies how the makeup in the source image
is morphed from the reference image, and a makeup detail loss to supervise the model within the selected
makeup detail area. On the other hand, for makeup removal, PSGAN++ applies an Identity Distill Network
to embed the identity information from with-makeup images into identity matrices. Finally, the
obtained makeup/identity matrices are fed to a Style Transfer Network that is able to edit the feature
maps to achieve makeup transfer or removal. To evaluate the effectiveness of our PSGAN++, we collect
a Makeup Transfer In the Wild dataset that contains images with diverse poses and expressions and
a Makeup Transfer High-Resolution dataset that contains high-resolution images. Experiments
demonstrate that PSGAN++ not only achieves state-of-the-art results with fine makeup details
even in cases of large pose/expression differences but also can perform partial or degree-controllable
makeup transfer.

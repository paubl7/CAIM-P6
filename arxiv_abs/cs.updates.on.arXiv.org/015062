Reductions of the self-consistent mean field theory model of amphiphilic molecule in solvent leads
to a singular family of Functionalized Cahn-Hilliard (FCH) energies. We modify the energy, removing
singularities to stabilize the computation of the gradient flows and develop a series of benchmark
problems that emulate the "morphological complexity" observed in experiments. These benchmarks
investigate the delicate balance between the rate of arrival of amphiphilic materials onto an interface
and least energy mechanism to accommodate the arriving mass. The result is a trichotomy of responses
in which two-dimensional interfaces grow by a regularized motion against curvature, pearling
bifurcations, or curve-splitting directly into networks of interfaces. We evaluate second order
predictor-corrector time stepping schemes for spectral spatial discretization. The schemes
are based on backward differentiation that are either Fully Implicit, with Preconditioned Steepest
Descent (PSD) solves for the nonlinear system, or linearly implicit with standard Implicit-Explicit
(IMEX) or Scalar Auxiliary Variable (SAV) approaches to the nonlinearities. All schemes use fixed
local truncation error to generate adaptive time-stepping. Each scheme requires proper preconditioning
to achieve robust performance that can enhance efficiency by several orders of magnitude. The nonlinear
PSD scheme achieves the smallest global discretization error at fixed local truncation error,
however the IMEX scheme is the most computationally efficient as measured by the number of Fast Fourier
Transform calls required to achieve a desired global error. The performance of the SAV scheme performance
mirrors IMEX, at roughly half the computational efficiency.

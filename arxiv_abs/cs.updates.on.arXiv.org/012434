CRISPR/Cas has the potential to revolutionize medicine, agriculture, and the way we understand
life itself. Understanding the trajectory of innovation, how it is influenced and who pays for it,
is essential for such a transformative technology. The University of California and the Broad/Harvard/MIT
systems are the two most prominent academic institutions involved in the research and development
of CRISPR/Cas. Here we present a model of co-funding networks for CRISPR/Cas research at these institutions,
using funding acknowledgments to build connections. We map papers representing 95% of citations
on CRISPR/Cas from these institutions grouped by the stage that each represents in the translational
research process (as a biological phenomenon, as a research tool, and development and applications
of these technologies), and use a novel technique to analyse the relationships between the structures
of the co-funding networks, the phase of research, and funding sources. The co-funding subnetworks
were similar in that US government research funding played the decisive role in early stage research.
Research at Broad/Harvard/MIT is also strongly supported by philanthropic/charitable organizations
in later stages of the translational research process, clustered around certain topics. Applications
for CRISPR technologies were underrepresented, which bolsters findings on the preponderance
of the US private sector in developing applications, and the disproportionate number of Chinese
institutions filing patents for industrial and food systems applications. These network models
raise fundamental questions about the role of the state in supporting breakthrough innovations,
risk, reward, and the influence of the private sector and philanthropy over the trajectory of transformative
technologies.

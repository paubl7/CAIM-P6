Wastewater treatment plants are designed to eliminate pollutants and alleviate environmental
pollution. However, the construction and operation of WWTPs consume resources, emit greenhouse
gases (GHGs) and produce residual sludge, thus require further optimization. WWTPs are complex
to control and optimize because of high nonlinearity and variation. This study used a novel technique,
multi-agent deep reinforcement learning, to simultaneously optimize dissolved oxygen and chemical
dosage in a WWTP. The reward function was specially designed from life cycle perspective to achieve
sustainable optimization. Five scenarios were considered: baseline, three different effluent
quality and cost-oriented scenarios. The result shows that optimization based on LCA has lower
environmental impacts compared to baseline scenario, as cost, energy consumption and greenhouse
gas emissions reduce to 0.890 CNY/m3-ww, 0.530 kWh/m3-ww, 2.491 kg CO2-eq/m3-ww respectively.
The cost-oriented control strategy exhibits comparable overall performance to the LCA driven
strategy since it sacrifices environmental bene ts but has lower cost as 0.873 CNY/m3-ww. It is worth
mentioning that the retrofitting of WWTPs based on resources should be implemented with the consideration
of impact transfer. Specifically, LCA SW scenario decreases 10 kg PO4-eq in eutrophication potential
compared to the baseline within 10 days, while significantly increases other indicators. The major
contributors of each indicator are identified for future study and improvement. Last, the author
discussed that novel dynamic control strategies required advanced sensors or a large amount of
data, so the selection of control strategies should also consider economic and ecological conditions.

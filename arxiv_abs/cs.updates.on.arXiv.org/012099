Text is the most widely used means of communication today. This data is abundant but nevertheless
complex to exploit within algorithms. For years, scientists have been trying to implement different
techniques that enable computers to replicate some mechanisms of human reading. During the past
five years, research disrupted the capacity of the algorithms to unleash the value of text data.
It brings today, many opportunities for the insurance industry.Understanding those methods and,
above all, knowing how to apply them is a major challenge and key to unleash the value of text data that
have been stored for many years. Processing language with computer brings many new opportunities
especially in the insurance sector where reports are central in the information used by insurers.
SCOR's Data Analytics team has been working on the implementation of innovative tools or products
that enable the use of the latest research on text analysis. Understanding text mining techniques
in insurance enhances the monitoring of the underwritten risks and many processes that finally
benefit policyholders.This article proposes to explain opportunities that Natural Language
Processing (NLP) are providing to insurance. It details different methods used today in practice
traces back the story of them. We also illustrate the implementation of certain methods using open
source libraries and python codes that we have developed to facilitate the use of these techniques.After
giving a general overview on the evolution of text mining during the past few years,we share about
how to conduct a full study with text mining and share some examples to serve those models into insurance
products or services. Finally, we explained in more details every step that composes a Natural Language
Processing study to ensure the reader can have a deep understanding on the implementation.

Multi-degree of freedom robots are playing very important role in different applications of automation.
They are providing much more accuracy in carrying out a typical procedure as compared to the manual
work done by human. In recent years the design, fabrication and development of robotic arms have
been active research areas in robotics all around the world. This project describe a mechanical
system, design concept and prototype implementation of a 6 DOF robotic arm, which should perform
industrial task such as pick and place of fragile objects operation. This robot arm being controlled
by micro-controller has base, shoulder, elbow, wrist rotation and a functional gripper. Gripper
has been built as end-effector and is capable of grasping diverse objects within own workspace of
the arm possible. I made an effort to endeavour one of the best model possible out of the three concepts
tried. The three concepts that I undertook were dependent on the type of mechanism used to provide
the movement. The first concept was to provide the movement with the help of Pneumatics. The idea
of pneumatics did provide a feasible movement but I had to overcome the barrier of the weight as the
weight of either the storage of gas or the air compressor would have affected the usage evidently.
Similarly, in the second concept, I dealt with the forces of Hydraulics. The forces exerted by hydraulics,
not only restricted the movement, but also annexed a certain amount of delay in the time period in
which the movement had to be done. In, the third concept, I tried to provide the necessary movement
with the help of Servo Motors. The results achieved with servo motors in replacement of pneumatics
and hydraulics were impeccable. The motors not only provided the movement with minimal lag but also
did not impede the movement of the hand.

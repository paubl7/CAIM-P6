We experimentally evaluate the practical state-of-the-art in graph bipartization (Odd Cycle
Transversal), motivated by recent advances in near-term quantum computing hardware and the related
embedding problems. We assemble a preprocessing suite of fast input reduction routines from the
Odd Cycle Transversal (OCT) and Vertex Cover (VC) literature, and compare algorithm implementations
using Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization problems from the quantum literature. We also
generate a corpus of frustrated cluster loop graphs, which have previously been used to benchmark
quantum annealing hardware. The diversity of these graphs leads to harder OCT instances than in
existing benchmarks. In addition to combinatorial branching algorithms for solving OCT directly,
we study various reformulations into other NP-hard problems such as VC and Integer Linear Programming
(ILP), enabling the use of solvers such as CPLEX. We find that for heuristic solutions with time constraints
under a second, iterative compression routines jump-started with a heuristic solution perform
best, after which point using a highly tuned solver like CPLEX is worthwhile. Results on exact solvers
are split between using ILP formulations on CPLEX and solving VC formulations with a branch-and-reduce
solver. We extend our results with a large corpus of synthetic graphs, establishing robustness
and potential to generalize to other domain data. In total, over 8000 graph instances are evaluated,
compared to the previous canonical corpus of 100 graphs. Finally, we provide all code and data in
an open source suite, including a Python API for accessing reduction routines and branching algorithms,
along with scripts for fully replicating our results.

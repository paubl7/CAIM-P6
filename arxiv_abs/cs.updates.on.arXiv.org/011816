Property testing algorithms are highly efficient algorithms, that come with probabilistic accuracy
guarantees. For a property P, the goal is to distinguish inputs that have P from those that are far
from having P with high probability correctly, by querying only a small number of local parts of the
input. In property testing on graphs, the distance is measured by the number of edge modifications
(additions or deletions), that are necessary to transform a graph into one with property P. Much
research has focussed on the query complexity of such algorithms, i. e. the number of queries the
algorithm makes to the input, but in view of applications, the running time of the algorithm is equally
relevant. In (Adler, Harwath STACS 2018), a natural extension of the bounded degree graph model
of property testing to relational databases of bounded degree was introduced, and it was shown that
on databases of bounded degree and bounded tree-width, every property that is expressible in monadic
second-order logic with counting (CMSO) is testable with constant query complexity and sublinear
running time. It remains open whether this can be improved to constant running time. In this paper
we introduce a new model, which is based on the bounded degree model, but the distance measure allows
both edge (tuple) modifications and vertex (element) modifications. Our main theorem shows that
on databases of bounded degree and bounded tree-width, every property that is expressible in CMSO
is testable with constant query complexity and constant running time in the new model. We also show
that every property that is testable in the classical model is testable in our model with the same
query complexity and running time, but the converse is not true. We argue that our model is natural
and our meta-theorem showing constant-time CMSO testability supports this.

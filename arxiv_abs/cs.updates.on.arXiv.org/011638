This paper studies the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA), which is topical in Multimedia community
recently. Particularly, we explore two critical research problems existed in VQA: (1) efficiently
fusing the visual and textual modalities; (2) enabling the visual reasoning ability of VQA models
in answering complex questions. To address these challenging problems, a novel Question Guided
Modular Routing Networks (QGMRN) has been proposed in this paper. Particularly, The QGMRN is composed
of visual, textual and routing network. The visual and textual network serve as the backbones for
the generic feature extractors of visual and textual modalities. QGMRN can fuse the visual and textual
modalities at multiple semantic levels. Typically, the visual reasoning is facilitated by the
routing network in a discrete and stochastic way by using Gumbel-Softmax trick for module selection.
When the input reaches a certain modular layer, routing network newly proposed in this paper, dynamically
selects a portion of modules from that layer to process the input depending on the question features
generated by the textual network. It can also learn to reason by routing between the generic modules
without additional supervision information or expert knowledge. Benefiting from the dynamic
routing mechanism, QGMRN can outperform the previous classical VQA methods by a large margin and
achieve the competitive results against the state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, attention
mechanism is integrated into our QGMRN model and thus can further boost the model performance. Empirically,
extensive experiments on the CLEVR and CLEVR-Humans datasets validate the effectiveness of our
proposed model, and the state-of-the-art performance has been achieved.

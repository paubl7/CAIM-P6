Automatic estimation of pain intensity from facial expressions in videos has an immense potential
in health care applications. However, domain adaptation (DA) is needed to alleviate the problem
of domain shifts that typically occurs between video data captured in source and target do-mains.
Given the laborious task of collecting and annotating videos, and the subjective bias due to ambiguity
among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised learning (WSL)is gaining attention in such
applications. Yet, most state-of-the-art WSL models are typically formulated as regression problems,
and do not leverage the ordinal relation between intensity levels, nor the temporal coherence of
multiple consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new deep learn-ing model for weakly-supervised
DA with ordinal regression(WSDA-OR), where videos in target domain have coarse la-bels provided
on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR model enforces ordinal relationships among the intensity levels
as-signed to the target sequences, and associates multiple relevant frames to sequence-level
labels (instead of a single frame). In particular, it learns discriminant and domain-invariant
feature representations by integrating multiple in-stance learning with deep adversarial DA,
where soft Gaussian labels are used to efficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels
from the target domain. The proposed approach was validated on the RECOLA video dataset as fully-labeled
source domain, and UNBC-McMaster video data as weakly-labeled target domain. We have also validated
WSDA-OR on BIOVID and Fatigue (private) datasets for sequence level estimation. Experimental
results indicate that our approach can provide a significant improvement over the state-of-the-art
models, allowing to achieve a greater localization accuracy.

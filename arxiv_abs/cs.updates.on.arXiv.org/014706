The challenge of recognizing named entities in a given text has been a very dynamic field in recent
years. This is due to the advances in neural network architectures, increase of computing power
and the availability of diverse labeled datasets, which deliver pre-trained, highly accurate
models. These tasks are generally focused on tagging common entities, but domain-specific use-cases
require tagging custom entities which are not part of the pre-trained models. This can be solved
by either fine-tuning the pre-trained models, or by training custom models. The main challenge
lies in obtaining reliable labeled training and test datasets, and manual labeling would be a highly
tedious task. In this paper we present PharmKE, a text analysis platform focused on the pharmaceutical
domain, which applies deep learning through several stages for thorough semantic analysis of pharmaceutical
articles. It performs text classification using state-of-the-art transfer learning models,
and thoroughly integrates the results obtained through a proposed methodology. The methodology
is used to create accurately labeled training and test datasets, which are then used to train models
for custom entity labeling tasks, centered on the pharmaceutical domain. The obtained results
are compared to the fine-tuned BERT and BioBERT models trained on the same dataset. Additionally,
the PharmKE platform integrates the results obtained from named entity recognition tasks to resolve
co-references of entities and analyze the semantic relations in every sentence, thus setting up
a baseline for additional text analysis tasks, such as question answering and fact extraction.
The recognized entities are also used to expand the knowledge graph generated by DBpedia Spotlight
for a given pharmaceutical text.

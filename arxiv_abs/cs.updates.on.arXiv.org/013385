Image Analysis offers a new tool for classifying vascular plant species based on the morphological
and colorimetric features of the seeds, and has made significant contributions in systematic studies.
However, in order to extract the morphological and colorimetric features, it is necessary to segment
the image containing the samples to be analysed. This stage represents one of the most challenging
steps in image processing, as it is difficult to separate uniform and homogeneous objects from the
background. In this paper, we present a new, open source plugin for the automatic segmentation of
an image of a seed sample. This plugin was written in Java to allow it to work with ImageJ open source
software. The new plugin was tested on a total of 3,386 seed samples from 120 species belonging to
the Fabaceae family. Digital images were acquired using a flatbed scanner. In order to test the efficacy
of this approach in terms of identifying the edges of objects and separating them from the background,
each sample was scanned using four different hues of blue for the background, and a total of 480 digital
images were elaborated. The performance of the new plugin was compared with a method based on double
image acquisition (with a black and white background) using the same seed samples, in which images
were manually segmented using the Core ImageJ plugin. The results showed that the new plugin was
able to segment all of the digital images without generating any object detection errors. In addition,
the new plugin was able to segment images within an average of 0.02 s, while the average time for execution
with the manual method was 63 s. This new open source plugin is proven to be able to work on a single image,
and to be highly efficient in terms of time and segmentation when working with large numbers of images
and a wide diversity of shapes.

In this position paper, we discuss the critical need for integrating zero trust (ZT) principles
into next-generation communication networks (5G/6G) for both tactical and commercial applications.
We highlight the challenges and introduce the concept of an intelligent zero trust architecture
(i-ZTA) as a security framework in 5G/6G networks with untrusted components. While network virtualization,
software-defined networking (SDN), and service-based architectures (SBA) are key enablers of
5G networks, operating in an untrusted environment has also become a key feature of the networks.
Further, seamless connectivity to a high volume of devices in multi-radio access technology (RAT)
has broadened the attack surface on information infrastructure. Network assurance in a dynamic
untrusted environment calls for revolutionary architectures beyond existing static security
frameworks. This paper presents the architectural design of an i-ZTA upon which modern artificial
intelligence (AI) algorithms can be developed to provide information security in untrusted networks.
We introduce key ZT principles as real-time Monitoring of the security state of network assets,
Evaluating the risk of individual access requests, and Deciding on access authorization using
a dynamic trust algorithm, called MED components. The envisioned architecture adopts an SBA-based
design, similar to the 3GPP specification of 5G networks, by leveraging the open radio access network
(O-RAN) architecture with appropriate real-time engines and network interfaces for collecting
necessary machine learning data. The i-ZTA is also expected to exploit the multi-access edge computing
(MEC) technology of 5G as a key enabler of intelligent MED components for resource-constraint devices.

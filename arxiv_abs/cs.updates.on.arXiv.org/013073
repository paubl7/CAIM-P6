Anomaly Detectors are trained on healthy operating condition data and raise an alarm when the measured
samples deviate from the training data distribution. This means that the samples used to train the
model should be sufficient in quantity and representative of the healthy operating conditions.
But for industrial systems subject to changing operating conditions, acquiring such comprehensive
sets of samples requires a long collection period and delay the point at which the anomaly detector
can be trained and put in operation. A solution to this problem is to perform unsupervised transfer
learning (UTL), to transfer complementary data between different units. In the literature however,
UTL aims at finding common structure between the datasets, to perform clustering or dimensionality
reduction. Yet, the task of transferring and combining complementary training data has not been
studied. Our proposed framework is designed to transfer complementary operating conditions between
different units in a completely unsupervised way to train more robust anomaly detectors. It differs,
thereby, from other unsupervised transfer learning works as it focuses on a one-class classification
problem. The proposed methodology enables to detect anomalies in operating conditions only experienced
by other units. The proposed end-to-end framework uses adversarial deep learning to ensure alignment
of the different units' distributions. The framework introduces a new loss, inspired by a dimensionality
reduction tool, to enforce the conservation of the inherent variability of each dataset, and uses
state-of-the art once-class approach to detect anomalies. We demonstrate the benefit of the proposed
framework using three open source datasets.

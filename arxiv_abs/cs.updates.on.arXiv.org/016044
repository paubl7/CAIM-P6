Climate models encapsulate our best understanding of the Earth system, allowing research to be
conducted on its future under alternative assumptions of how human-driven climate forces are going
to evolve. An important application of climate models is to provide metrics of mean and extreme climate
changes, particularly under these alternative future scenarios, as these quantities drive the
impacts of climate on society and natural systems. Because of the need to explore a wide range of alternative
scenarios and other sources of uncertainties in a computationally efficient manner, climate models
can only take us so far, as they require significant computational resources, especially when attempting
to characterize extreme events, which are rare and thus demand long and numerous simulations in
order to accurately represent their changing statistics. Here we use deep learning in a proof of
concept that lays the foundation for emulating global climate model output for different scenarios.
We train two "loosely conditioned" Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) that emulate daily
precipitation output from a fully coupled Earth system model: one GAN modeling Fall-Winter behavior
and the other Spring-Summer. Our GANs are trained to produce spatiotemporal samples: 32 days of
precipitation over a 64x128 regular grid discretizing the globe. We evaluate the generator with
a set of related performance metrics based upon KL divergence, and find the generated samples to
be nearly as well matched to the test data as the validation data is to test. We also find the generated
samples to accurately estimate the mean number of dry days and mean longest dry spell in the 32 day
samples. Our trained GANs can rapidly generate numerous realizations at a vastly reduced computational
expense, compared to large ensembles of climate models, which greatly aids in estimating the statistics
of extreme events.

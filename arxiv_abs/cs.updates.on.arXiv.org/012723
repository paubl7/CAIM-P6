A long line of work in social psychology has studied variations in people's susceptibility to persuasion
-- the extent to which they are willing to modify their opinions on a topic. This body of literature
suggests an interesting perspective on theoretical models of opinion formation by interacting
parties in a network: in addition to considering interventions that directly modify people's intrinsic
opinions, it is also natural to consider interventions that modify people's susceptibility to
persuasion. In this work, motivated by this fact we propose a new framework for social influence.
Specifically, we adopt a popular model for social opinion dynamics, where each agent has some fixed
innate opinion, and a resistance that measures the importance it places on its innate opinion; agents
influence one another's opinions through an iterative process. Under non-trivial conditions,
this iterative process converges to some equilibrium opinion vector. For the unbudgeted variant
of the problem, the goal is to select the resistance of each agent (from some given range) such that
the sum of the equilibrium opinions is minimized. We prove that the objective function is in general
non-convex. Hence, formulating the problem as a convex program as in an early version of this work
(Abebe et al., KDD'18) might have potential correctness issues. We instead analyze the structure
of the objective function, and show that any local optimum is also a global optimum, which is somehow
surprising as the objective function might not be convex. Furthermore, we combine the iterative
process and the local search paradigm to design very efficient algorithms that can solve the unbudgeted
variant of the problem optimally on large-scale graphs containing millions of nodes. Finally,
we propose and evaluate experimentally a family of heuristics for the budgeted variation of the
problem.

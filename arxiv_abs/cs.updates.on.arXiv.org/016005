The traditional oil supply chain suffers from various shortcomings regarding crude oil extraction,
processing, distribution, environmental pollution, and traceability. It offers an only a forward
flow of products with almost no security and tracking process. In time, the system will lag behind
due to the limitations in quality inspection, fraudulent information, and monopolistic behavior
of supply chain entities. Inclusion of counterfeiting products and opaqueness of the system urge
renovation in this sector. The recent evolution of Industry 4.0 leads to the alternation in the supply
chain introducing the smart supply chain. Technological advancement can now reshape the infrastructure
of the supply chain for the future. In this paper, we suggest a conceptual framework utilizing Blockchain
and Smart Contract to monitor the overall oil supply chain. Blockchain is a groundbreaking technology
to monitor and support the security building of a decentralized type supply chain over a peer-to-peer
network. The use of the Internet of Things (IoT), especially sensors, opens broader window to track
the global supply chain in real-time. We construct a methodology to support reverse traceability
for each participant of the supply chain. The functions and characteristics of Blockchain and Smart
Contract are defined. Implementation of Smart Contracts has also been shown with detailed analysis.
We further describe the challenges of implementing such a system and validate our framework's adaptability
in the real world. The paper concludes with future research scope to mitigate the restrictions of
data management and maintenance with advanced working prototypes and agile systems achieving
greater traceability and transparency.

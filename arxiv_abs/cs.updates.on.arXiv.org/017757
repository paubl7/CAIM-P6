The rapid development of modern science and technology has spawned rich scientific topics to research
and endless production of literature in them. Just like X-ray imaging in medicine, can we intuitively
identify the development limit and internal evolution pattern of scientific topic from the relationship
of massive knowledge? To answer this question, we collect 71431 seminal articles of topics that
cover 16 disciplines and their citation data, and extracts the "idea tree" of each topic to restore
the structure of the development of 71431 topic networks from scratch. We define the Knowledge Entropy
(KE) metric, and the contribution of high knowledge entropy nodes to increase the depth of the idea
tree is regarded as the basis for topic development. By observing "X-ray images" of topics, We find
two interesting phenomena: (1) Even though the scale of topics may increase unlimitedly, there
is an insurmountable cap of topic development: the depth of the idea tree does not exceed 6 jumps,
which coincides with the classical "Six Degrees of Separation"! (2) It is difficult for a single
article to contribute more than 3 jumps to the depth of its topic, to this end, the continuing increase
in the depth of the idea tree needs to be motivated by the influence relay of multiple high knowledge
entropy nodes. Through substantial statistical fits, we derive a unified quantitative relationship
between the change in topic depth ${\Delta D}^t(v)$ and the change in knowledge entropy over time
${KE}^t\left(v\right)$ of the article $v$ driving the increase in depth in the topic: ${\Delta
D}^t(v) \approx \log \frac{KE^{t}(v)}{\left(t-t_{0}\right)^{1.8803}}$ , which can effectively
portray evolution patterns of topics and predict their development potential. The various phenomena
found by scientific x-ray may provide a new paradigm for explaining and understanding the evolution
of science and technology.

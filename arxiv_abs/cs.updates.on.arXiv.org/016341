Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) contain more biologically realistic structures and biologically-inspired
learning principles than those in standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). SNNs are considered
the third generation of ANNs, powerful on the robust computation with a low computational cost.
The neurons in SNNs are non-differential, containing decayed historical states and generating
event-based spikes after their states reaching the firing threshold. These dynamic characteristics
of SNNs make it difficult to be directly trained with the standard backpropagation (BP), which is
also considered not biologically plausible. In this paper, a Biologically-plausible Reward Propagation
(BRP) algorithm is proposed and applied to the SNN architecture with both spiking-convolution
(with both 1D and 2D convolutional kernels) and full-connection layers. Unlike the standard BP
that propagates error signals from post to presynaptic neurons layer by layer, the BRP propagates
target labels instead of errors directly from the output layer to all pre-hidden layers. This effort
is more consistent with the top-down reward-guiding learning in cortical columns of the neocortex.
Synaptic modifications with only local gradient differences are induced with pseudo-BP that might
also be replaced with the Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). The performance of the proposed
BRP-SNN is further verified on the spatial (including MNIST and Cifar-10) and temporal (including
TIDigits and DvsGesture) tasks, where the SNN using BRP has reached a similar accuracy compared
to other state-of-the-art BP-based SNNs and saved 50% more computational cost than ANNs. We think
the introduction of biologically plausible learning rules to the training procedure of biologically
realistic SNNs will give us more hints and inspirations toward a better understanding of the biological
system's intelligent nature.

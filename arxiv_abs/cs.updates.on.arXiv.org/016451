The geometric median of a tuple of vectors is the vector that minimizes the sum of Euclidean distances
to the vectors of the tuple. Interestingly, the geometric median can also be viewed as the equilibrium
of a process where each vector of the tuple pulls on a common decision point with a unitary force towards
them, promoting the "one voter, one unit force" fairness principle. In this paper, we analyze the
strategyproofness of the geometric median as a voting system. Assuming that voters want to minimize
the Euclidean distance between their preferred vector and the outcome of the vote, we first prove
that, in the general case, the geometric median is not even $\alpha$-strategyproof. However, in
the limit of a large number of voters, assuming that voters' preferred vectors are drawn i.i.d. from
a distribution of preferred vectors, we also prove that the geometric median is asymptotically
$\alpha$-strategyproof. The bound $\alpha$ describes what a voter can gain (at most) by deviating
from truthfulness. We show how to compute this bound as a function of the distribution followed by
the vectors. We then generalize our results to the case where each voter actually cares more about
some dimensions rather than others. Roughly, we show that, if some dimensions are more polarized
and regarded as more important, then the geometric median becomes less strategyproof. Interestingly,
we also show how the skewed geometric medians can be used to improve strategyproofness. Nevertheless,
if voters care differently about different dimensions, we prove that no skewed geometric median
can achieve strategyproofness for all of them. Overall, our results provide insight into the extent
to which the (skewed) geometric median is a suitable approach to aggregate high-dimensional disagreements.

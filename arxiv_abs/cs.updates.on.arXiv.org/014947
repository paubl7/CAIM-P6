Graph network science is becoming increasingly popular, notably in big-data perspective where
understanding individual entities for individual functional roles is complex and time consuming.
It is likely when a set of genes are regulated by a set of genetic variants, the genes set is recruited
for a common or related functional purpose. Grouping and extracting communities from network of
associations becomes critical to understand system complexity, thus prioritizing genes for dis-ease
and functional associations. Workload is reduced when studying entities one at a time. For this,
we present GraphBreak, a suite of tools for community detection application, such as for gene co-expression,
protein interaction, regulation network, etc.Although developed for use case of eQTLs regulatory
genomic net-work community study -- results shown with our analysis with sample eQTL data. Graphbreak
can be deployed for other studies if input data has been fed in requisite format, including but not
limited to gene co-expression networks, protein-protein interaction network, signaling pathway
and metabolic network. Graph-Break showed critical use case value in its downstream analysis for
disease association of communities detected. If all independent steps of community detection
and analysis are a step-by-step sub-part of the algorithm, GraphBreak can be considered a new algorithm
for community based functional characterization. Combination of various algorithmic implementation
modules into a single script for this purpose illustrates GraphBreak novelty. Compared to other
similar tools, with GraphBreak we can better detect communities with over-representation of its
member genes for statistical association with diseases, therefore target genes which can be prioritized
for drug-positioning or drug-re-positioning as the case be.

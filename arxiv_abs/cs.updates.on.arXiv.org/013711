This paper proposes a new robust update rule of target network for deep reinforcement learning (DRL),
to replace the conventional update rule, given as an exponential moving average. The target network
is for smoothly generating the reference signals for a main network in DRL, thereby reducing learning
variance. The problem with its conventional update rule is the fact that all the parameters are smoothly
copied with the same speed from the main network, even when some of them are trying to update toward
the wrong directions. This behavior increases the risk of generating the wrong reference signals.
Although slowing down the overall update speed is a naive way to mitigate wrong updates, it would
decrease learning speed. To robustly update the parameters while keeping learning speed, a t-soft
update method, which is inspired by student-t distribution, is derived with reference to the analogy
between the exponential moving average and the normal distribution. Through the analysis of the
derived t-soft update, we show that it takes over the properties of the student-t distribution.
Specifically, with a heavy-tailed property of the student-t distribution, the t-soft update automatically
excludes extreme updates that differ from past experiences. In addition, when the updates are similar
to the past experiences, it can mitigate the learning delay by increasing the amount of updates.
In PyBullet robotics simulations for DRL, an online actor-critic algorithm with the t-soft update
outperformed the conventional methods in terms of the obtained return and/or its variance. From
the training process by the t-soft update, we found that the t-soft update is globally consistent
with the standard soft update, and the update rates are locally adjusted for acceleration or suppression.

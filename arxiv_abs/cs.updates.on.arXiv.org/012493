Selecting input variables or design points for statistical models has been of great interest in
adaptive design and active learning. Motivated by two scientific examples, this paper presents
a strategy of selecting the design points for a regression model when the underlying regression
function is discontinuous. The first example we undertook was for the purpose of accelerating imaging
speed in a high resolution material imaging; the second was use of sequential design for the purpose
of mapping a chemical phase diagram. In both examples, the underlying regression functions have
discontinuities, so many of the existing design optimization approaches cannot be applied because
they mostly assume a continuous regression function. Although some existing adaptive design strategies
developed from treed regression models can handle the discontinuities, the Bayesian approaches
come with computationally expensive Markov Chain Monte Carlo techniques for posterior inferences
and subsequent design point selections, which is not appropriate for the first motivating example
that requires computation at least faster than the original imaging speed. In addition, the treed
models are based on the domain partitioning that are inefficient when the discontinuities occurs
over complex sub-domain boundaries. We propose a simple and effective adaptive design strategy
for a regression analysis with discontinuities: some statistical properties with a fixed design
will be presented first, and then these properties will be used to propose a new criterion of selecting
the design points for the regression analysis. Sequential design with the new criterion will be
presented with comprehensive simulated examples, and its application to the two motivating examples
will be presented.

Deep learning has proven effective for various application tasks, but its applicability is limited
by the reliance on annotated examples. Self-supervised learning has emerged as a promising direction
to alleviate the supervision bottleneck, but existing work focuses on leveraging co-occurrences
in unlabeled data for task-agnostic representation learning, as exemplified by masked language
model pretraining. In this chapter, we explore task-specific self-supervision, which leverages
domain knowledge to automatically annotate noisy training examples for end applications, either
by introducing labeling functions for annotating individual instances, or by imposing constraints
over interdependent label decisions. We first present deep probabilistic logic(DPL), which offers
a unifying framework for task-specific self-supervision by composing probabilistic logic with
deep learning. DPL represents unknown labels as latent variables and incorporates diverse self-supervision
using probabilistic logic to train a deep neural network end-to-end using variational EM. Next,
we present self-supervised self-supervision(S4), which adds to DPL the capability to learn new
self-supervision automatically. Starting from an initial seed self-supervision, S4 iteratively
uses the deep neural network to propose new self supervision. These are either added directly (a
form of structured self-training) or verified by a human expert (as in feature-based active learning).
Experiments on real-world applications such as biomedical machine reading and various text classification
tasks show that task-specific self-supervision can effectively leverage domain expertise and
often match the accuracy of supervised methods with a tiny fraction of human effort.

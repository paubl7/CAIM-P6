Background: The inability to test at scale has become humanity's Achille's heel in the ongoing war
against the COVID-19 pandemic. A scalable screening tool would be a game changer. Building on the
prior work on cough-based diagnosis of respiratory diseases, we propose, develop and test an Artificial
Intelligence (AI)-powered screening solution for COVID-19 infection that is deployable via a
smartphone app. The app, named AI4COVID-19 records and sends three 3-second cough sounds to an AI
engine running in the cloud, and returns a result within two minutes. Methods: Cough is a symptom
of over thirty non-COVID-19 related medical conditions. This makes the diagnosis of a COVID-19
infection by cough alone an extremely challenging multidisciplinary problem. We address this
problem by investigating the distinctness of pathomorphological alterations in the respiratory
system induced by COVID-19 infection when compared to other respiratory infections. To overcome
the COVID-19 cough training data shortage we exploit transfer learning. To reduce the misdiagnosis
risk stemming from the complex dimensionality of the problem, we leverage a multi-pronged mediator
centered risk-averse AI architecture. Results: Results show AI4COVID-19 can distinguish among
COVID-19 coughs and several types of non-COVID-19 coughs. The accuracy is promising enough to encourage
a large-scale collection of labeled cough data to gauge the generalization capability of AI4COVID-19.
AI4COVID-19 is not a clinical grade testing tool. Instead, it offers a screening tool deployable
anytime, anywhere, by anyone. It can also be a clinical decision assistance tool used to channel
clinical-testing and treatment to those who need it the most, thereby saving more lives.

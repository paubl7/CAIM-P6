Cut and spectral sparsification of graphs have numerous applications, including e.g. speeding
up algorithms for cuts and Laplacian solvers. These powerful notions have recently been extended
to hypergraphs, which are much richer and may offer new applications. However, the current bounds
on the size of hypergraph sparsifiers are not as tight as the corresponding bounds for graphs. Our
first result is a polynomial-time algorithm that, given a hypergraph on $n$ vertices with maximum
hyperedge size $r$, outputs an $\epsilon$-spectral sparsifier with $O^*(nr)$ hyperedges, where
$O^*$ suppresses $(\epsilon^{-1} \log n)^{O(1)}$ factors. This size bound improves the two previous
bounds: $O^*(n^3)$ [Soma and Yoshida, SODA'19] and $O^*(nr^3)$ [Bansal, Svensson and Trevisan,
FOCS'19]. Our main technical tool is a new method for proving concentration of the nonlinear analogue
of the quadratic form of the Laplacians for hypergraph expanders. We complement this with lower
bounds on the bit complexity of any compression scheme that $(1+\epsilon)$-approximates all the
cuts in a given hypergraph, and hence also on the bit complexity of every $\epsilon$-cut/spectral
sparsifier. These lower bounds are based on Ruzsa-Szemer\'edi graphs, and a particular instantiation
yields an $\Omega(nr)$ lower bound on the bit complexity even for fixed constant $\epsilon$. This
is tight up to polylogarithmic factors in $n$, due to recent hypergraph cut sparsifiers of [Chen,
Khanna and Nagda, FOCS'20]. Finally, for directed hypergraphs, we present an algorithm that computes
an $\epsilon$-spectral sparsifier with $O^*(n^2r^3)$ hyperarcs, where $r$ is the maximum size
of a hyperarc. For small $r$, this improves over $O^*(n^3)$ known from [Soma and Yoshida, SODA'19],
and is getting close to the trivial lower bound of $\Omega(n^2)$ hyperarcs.

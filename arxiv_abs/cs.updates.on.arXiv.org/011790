This thesis focuses on the research and development of the Hemodynamic Tissue Signature (HTS) method:
an unsupervised machine learning approach to describe the vascular heterogeneity of glioblastomas
by means of perfusion MRI analysis. The HTS builds on the concept of habitats. An habitat is defined
as a sub-region of the lesion with a particular MRI profile describing a specific physiological
behavior. The HTS method delineates four habitats within the glioblastoma: the High Angiogenic
Tumor (HAT) habitat, as the most perfused region of the enhancing tumor; the Low Angiogenic Tumor
(LAT) habitat, as the region of the enhancing tumor with a lower angiogenic profile; the potentially
Infiltrated Peripheral Edema (IPE) habitat, as the non-enhancing region adjacent to the tumor
with elevated perfusion indexes; and the Vasogenic Peripheral Edema (VPE) habitat, as the remaining
edema of the lesion with the lowest perfusion profile. The results of this thesis have been published
in ten scientific contributions, including top-ranked journals and conferences in the areas of
Medical Informatics, Statistics and Probability, Radiology & Nuclear Medicine, Machine Learning
and Data Mining and Biomedical Engineering. An industrial patent registered in Spain (ES201431289A),
Europe (EP3190542A1) and EEUU (US20170287133A1) was also issued, summarizing the efforts of the
thesis to generate tangible assets besides the academic revenue obtained from research publications.
Finally, the methods, technologies and original ideas conceived in this thesis led to the foundation
of ONCOANALYTICS CDX, a company framed into the business model of companion diagnostics for pharmaceutical
compounds, thought as a vehicle to facilitate the industrialization of the ONCOhabitats technology.

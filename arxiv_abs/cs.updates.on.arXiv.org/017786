We consider the problem of maintaining an approximate maximum independent set of geometric objects
under insertions and deletions. We present data structures that maintain a constant-factor approximate
maximum independent set for broad classes of fat objects in $d$ dimensions, where $d$ is assumed
to be a constant, in sublinear \textit{worst-case} update time. This gives the first results for
dynamic independent set in a wide variety of geometric settings, such as disks, fat polygons, and
their high-dimensional equivalents. For axis-aligned squares and hypercubes, our result improves
upon all (recently announced) previous works. We obtain, in particular, a dynamic $(4+\epsilon)$-approximation
for squares, with $O(\log^4 n)$ worst-case update time. Our result is obtained via a two-level approach.
First, we develop a dynamic data structure which stores all objects and provides an approximate
independent set when queried, with output-sensitive running time. We show that via standard methods
such a structure can be used to obtain a dynamic algorithm with \textit{amortized} update time bounds.
Then, to obtain worst-case update time algorithms, we develop a generic deamortization scheme
that with each insertion/deletion keeps (i) the update time bounded and (ii) the number of changes
in the independent set constant. We show that such a scheme is applicable to fat objects by showing
an appropriate generalization of a separator theorem. Interestingly, we show that our deamortization
scheme is also necessary in order to obtain worst-case update bounds: If for a class of objects our
scheme is not applicable, then no constant-factor approximation with sublinear worst-case update
time is possible. We show that such a lower bound applies even for seemingly simple classes of geometric
objects including axis-aligned rectangles in the plane.

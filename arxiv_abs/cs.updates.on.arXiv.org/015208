With the rapid development of deep learning, many deep learning-based approaches have made great
achievements in object detection task. It is generally known that deep learning is a data-driven
method. Data directly impact the performance of object detectors to some extent. Although existing
datasets have included common objects in remote sensing images, they still have some limitations
in terms of scale, categories, and images. Therefore, there is a strong requirement for establishing
a large-scale benchmark on object detection in high-resolution remote sensing images. In this
paper, we propose a novel benchmark dataset with more than 1 million instances and more than 15,000
images for Fine-grAined object recognItion in high-Resolution remote sensing imagery which is
named as FAIR1M. All objects in the FAIR1M dataset are annotated with respect to 5 categories and
37 sub-categories by oriented bounding boxes. Compared with existing detection datasets dedicated
to object detection, the FAIR1M dataset has 4 particular characteristics: (1) it is much larger
than other existing object detection datasets both in terms of the quantity of instances and the
quantity of images, (2) it provides more rich fine-grained category information for objects in
remote sensing images, (3) it contains geographic information such as latitude, longitude and
resolution, (4) it provides better image quality owing to a careful data cleaning procedure. To
establish a baseline for fine-grained object recognition, we propose a novel evaluation method
and benchmark fine-grained object detection tasks and a visual classification task using several
State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) deep learning-based models on our FAIR1M dataset. Experimental results
strongly indicate that the FAIR1M dataset is closer to practical application and it is considerably
more challenging than existing datasets.

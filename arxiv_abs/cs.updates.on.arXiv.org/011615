In this paper, we would like to investigate optimal wireless streaming of a multi-quality tiled
360 virtual reality (VR) video from a server to multiple users. To this end, we propose to maximally
exploit potential multicast opportunities by effectively utilizing characteristics of multi-quality
tiled 360 VR videos and computation resources at the users' side. In particular, we consider two
requirements for quality variation in one field-of-view (FoV), i.e., the absolute smoothness
requirement and the relative smoothness requirement, and two video playback modes, i.e., the direct-playback
mode (without user transcoding) and transcode-playback mode (with user transcoding). Besides
natural multicast opportunities, we introduce two new types of multicast opportunities, namely,
relative smoothness-enabled multicast opportunities, which allow flexible tradeoff between
viewing quality and communications resource consumption, and transcoding-enabled multicast
opportunities, which allow flexible tradeoff between computation and communications resource
consumptions. Then, we establish a novel mathematical model that reflects the impacts of natural,
relative smoothness-enabled and transcoding-enabled multicast opportunities on the average
transmission energy and transcoding energy. Based on this model, we optimize the transmission
resource allocation, playback quality level selection and transmission quality level selection
to minimize the energy consumption in the four cases with different requirements for quality variation
and video playback modes. By comparing the optimal values in the four cases, we prove that the energy
consumption reduces when more multicast opportunities can be utilized. Finally, numerical results
show substantial gains of the proposed solutions over existing schemes, and demonstrate the importance
of effective exploitation of the three types of multicast opportunities.

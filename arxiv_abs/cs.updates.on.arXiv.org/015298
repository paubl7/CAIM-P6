Quantitative lung measures derived from computed tomography (CT) have been demonstrated to improve
prognostication in coronavirus disease (COVID-19) patients, but are not part of the clinical routine
since required manual segmentation of lung lesions is prohibitively time-consuming. We propose
a new fully automated deep learning framework for rapid quantification and differentiation between
lung lesions in COVID-19 pneumonia from both contrast and non-contrast CT images using convolutional
Long Short-Term Memory (ConvLSTM) networks. Utilizing the expert annotations, model training
was performed 5 times with separate hold-out sets using 5-fold cross-validation to segment ground-glass
opacity and high opacity (including consolidation and pleural effusion). The performance of the
method was evaluated on CT data sets from 197 patients with positive reverse transcription polymerase
chain reaction test result for SARS-CoV-2. Strong agreement between expert manual and automatic
segmentation was obtained for lung lesions with a Dice score coefficient of 0.876 $\pm$ 0.005; excellent
correlations of 0.978 and 0.981 for ground-glass opacity and high opacity volumes. In the external
validation set of 67 patients, there was dice score coefficient of 0.767 $\pm$ 0.009 as well as excellent
correlations of 0.989 and 0.996 for ground-glass opacity and high opacity volumes. Computations
for a CT scan comprising 120 slices were performed under 2 seconds on a personal computer equipped
with NVIDIA Titan RTX graphics processing unit. Therefore, our deep learning-based method allows
rapid fully-automated quantitative measurement of pneumonia burden from CT and may generate results
with an accuracy similar to the expert readers.

Reconstructions of sea level prior to the satellite altimeter era are usually derived from tide
gauge records; however most algorithms for this assume that modes of sea level variability are stationary
which is not true over several decades. Here we suggest a method that is based on optimized data-dependent
triangulations of the network of gauge stations. Data-dependent triangulations are triangulations
of point sets that rely not only on 2D point positions but also on additional data (e.g. elevation,
anomalies). In this article, we show how data-dependent triangulations with min-error criteria
can be used to reconstruct 2D maps of the sea surface anomaly over a longer time period, assuming that
height anomalies are continuously monitored at a sparse set of stations and, in addition, observations
of a reference surface is provided over a shorter time period. At the heart of our method is the idea
to learn a min-error triangulation based on the available reference data, and to use the learned
triangulation subsequently to compute piece-wise linear surface models for epochs in which only
observations from monitoring stations are given. We combine our approach of min-error triangulation
with $k$-order Delaunay triangulation to stabilize the triangles geometrically. We show that
this approach is advantageous for the reconstruction of the sea surface by combining tide gauge
measurements with data of modern satellite altimetry. We show how to learn a min-error triangulation
and a min-error $k$-order Delaunay triangulation using integer linear programming. We confront
our reconstructions against the Delaunay triangulation. With real data for the North Sea we show
that the min-error triangulation outperforms the Delaunay method significantly for reconstructions
back in time up to 18 years, and the $k$-order Delaunay min-error triangulation even up to 21 years
for $k=2$.

We consider the problem of computing shortest paths in weighted unit-disk graphs in constant dimension
$d$. Although the single-source and all-pairs variants of this problem are well-studied in the
plane case, no non-trivial exact distance oracles for unit-disk graphs have been known to date,
even for $d=2$. The classical result of Sedgewick and Vitter [Algorithmica '86] shows that for weighted
unit-disk graphs in the plane the $A^*$ search has average-case performance superior to that of
a standard shortest path algorithm, e.g., Dijkstra's algorithm. Specifically, if the $n$ corresponding
points of a weighted unit-disk graph $G$ are picked from a unit square uniformly at random, and the
connectivity radius is $r\in (0,1)$, $A^*$ finds a shortest path in $G$ in $O(n)$ expected time when
$r=\Omega(\sqrt{\log n/n})$, even though $G$ has $\Theta((nr)^2)$ edges in expectation. In other
words, the work done by the algorithm is in expectation proportional to the number of vertices and
not the number of edges. In this paper, we break this natural barrier and show even stronger sublinear
time results. We propose a new heuristic approach to computing point-to-point exact shortest paths
in unit-disk graphs. We analyze the average-case behavior of our heuristic using the same random
graph model as used by Sedgewick and Vitter and prove it superior to $A^*$. Specifically, we show
that, if we are able to report the set of all $k$ points of $G$ from an arbitrary rectangular region
of the plane in $O(k + t(n))$ time, then a shortest path between arbitrary two points of such a random
graph on the plane can be found in $O(1/r^2 + t(n))$ expected time. In particular, the state-of-the-art
range reporting data structures imply a sublinear expected bound for all $r=\Omega(\sqrt{\log
n/n})$ and $O(\sqrt{n})$ expected bound for $r=\Omega(n^{-1/4})$ after only near-linear preprocessing
of the point set.

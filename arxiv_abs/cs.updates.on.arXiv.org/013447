Learning from Demonstration (LfD) constitutes one of the most robust methodologies for constructing
efficient cognitive robotic systems. Current key challenges in the field include those of multi-agent
learning and long-term autonomy. Towards this direction, a novel cognitive architecture for multi-agent
LfD robotic learning is introduced in this paper, targeting to enable the reliable deployment of
open, scalable and expandable robotic systems in large-scale and complex environments. In particular,
the designed architecture capitalizes on the recent advances in the Artificial Intelligence (AI)
(and especially the Deep Learning (DL)) field, by establishing a Federated Learning (FL)-based
framework for incarnating a multi-human multi-robot collaborative learning environment. The
fundamental conceptualization relies on employing multiple AI-empowered cognitive processes
(implementing various robotic tasks) that operate at the edge nodes of a network of robotic platforms,
while global AI models (underpinning the aforementioned robotic tasks) are collectively created
and shared among the network, by elegantly combining information from a large number of human-robot
interaction instances. Pivotal novelties of the designed cognitive architecture include: a)
it introduces a new FL-based formalism that extends the conventional LfD learning paradigm to support
large-scale multi-agent operational settings, b) it elaborates previous FL-based self-learning
robotic schemes so as to incorporate the human in the learning loop, and c) it consolidates the fundamental
principles of FL with additional sophisticated AI-enabled learning methodologies for modelling
the multi-level inter-dependencies among the robotic tasks. The applicability of the proposed
framework is explained using an example of a real-world industrial case study for agile production-based
Critical Raw Materials (CRM) recovery.

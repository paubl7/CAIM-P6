Obtaining quantitative survey responses that are both accurate and informative is crucial to a
wide range of fields. Traditional and ubiquitous response formats such as Likert and Visual Analogue
Scales require condensation of responses into discrete point values - but sometimes a range of options
may better represent the correct answer. In this paper, we propose an efficient interval-valued
response mode, whereby responses are made by marking an ellipse along a continuous scale. We discuss
its potential to capture and quantify valuable information that would be lost using conventional
approaches, while preserving a high degree of response-efficiency. The information captured
by the response interval may represent a possible response range - i.e., a conjunctive set, such
as the real numbers between three and six. Alternatively, it may reflect uncertainty in respect
to a distinct response - i.e., a disjunctive set, such as a confidence interval. We then report a validation
study, utilizing our recently introduced open-source software (DECSYS) to explore how interval-valued
survey responses reflect experimental manipulations of several factors hypothesised to influence
interval width, across multiple contexts. Results consistently indicate that respondents used
interval widths effectively, and subjective participant feedback was also positive. We present
this as initial empirical evidence for the efficacy and value of interval-valued response capture.
Interestingly, our results also provide insight into respondents' reasoning about the different
aforementioned types of intervals - we replicate a tendency towards overconfidence for those representing
epistemic uncertainty (i.e., disjunctive sets), but find intervals representing inherent range
(i.e., conjunctive sets) to be well-calibrated.

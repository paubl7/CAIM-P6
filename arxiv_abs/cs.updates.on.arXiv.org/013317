Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has recently emerged as a prominent candidate for the Future
Internet Architecture (FIA) that addresses existing issues with the host-centric communication
model of the current TCP/IP-based Internet. Named Data Networking (NDN) is one of the most recent
and active ICN architectures that provides a clean slate approach for Internet communication.
NDN provides intrinsic content security where security is directly provided to the content instead
of communication channel. Among other security aspects, Access Control (AC) rules specify the
privileges for the entities that can access the content. In TCP/IP-based AC systems, due to the client-server
communication model, the servers control which client can access a particular content. In contrast,
ICN-based networks use content names to drive communication and decouple the content from its original
location. This phenomenon leads to the loss of control over the content causing different challenges
for the realization of efficient AC mechanisms. To date, considerable efforts have been made to
develop various AC mechanisms in NDN. In this paper, we provide a detailed and comprehensive survey
of the AC mechanisms in NDN. We follow a holistic approach towards AC in NDN where we first summarize
the ICN paradigm, describe the changes from channel-based security to content-based security
and highlight different cryptographic algorithms and security protocols in NDN. We then classify
the existing AC mechanisms into two main categories: Encryption-based AC and Encryption-independent
AC. Each category has different classes based on the working principle of AC (e.g., Attribute-based
AC, Name-based AC, Identity-based AC, etc). Finally, we present the lessons learned from the existing
AC mechanisms and identify the challenges of NDN-based AC at large, highlighting future research
directions for the community.

In this work we present a new physics-informed machine learning model that can be used to analyze
kinematic data from an instrumented mouthguard and detect impacts to the head. Monitoring player
impacts is vitally important to understanding and protecting from injuries like concussion. Typically,
to analyze this data, a combination of video analysis and sensor data is used to ascertain the recorded
events are true impacts and not false positives. In fact, due to the nature of using wearable devices
in sports, false positives vastly outnumber the true positives. Yet, manual video analysis is time-consuming.
This imbalance leads traditional machine learning approaches to exhibit poor performance in both
detecting true positives and preventing false negatives. Here, we show that by simulating head
impacts numerically using a standard Finite Element head-neck model, a large dataset of synthetic
impacts can be created to augment the gathered, verified, impact data from mouthguards. This combined
physics-informed machine learning impact detector reported improved performance on test datasets
compared to traditional impact detectors with negative predictive value and positive predictive
values of 88% and 87% respectively. Consequently, this model reported the best results to date for
an impact detection algorithm for American Football, achieving an F1 score of 0.95. In addition,
this physics-informed machine learning impact detector was able to accurately detect true and
false impacts from a test dataset at a rate of 90% and 100% relative to a purely manual video analysis
workflow. Saving over 12 hours of manual video analysis for a modest dataset, at an overall accuracy
of 92%, these results indicate that this model could be used in place of, or alongside, traditional
video analysis to allow for larger scale and more efficient impact detection in sports such as American
Football.

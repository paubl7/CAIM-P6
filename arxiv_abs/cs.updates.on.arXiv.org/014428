Large-scale and high-quality corpora are necessary for evaluating machine reading comprehension
models on a low-resource language like Vietnamese. Besides, machine reading comprehension (MRC)
for the health domain offers great potential for practical applications; however, there is still
very little MRC research in this domain. This paper presents ViNewsQA as a new corpus for the Vietnamese
language to evaluate healthcare reading comprehension models. The corpus comprises 22,057 human-generated
question-answer pairs. Crowd-workers create the questions and their answers based on a collection
of over 4,416 online Vietnamese healthcare news articles, where the answers comprise spans extracted
from the corresponding articles. In particular, we develop a process of creating a corpus for the
Vietnamese machine reading comprehension. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate that our corpus
requires abilities beyond simple reasoning, such as word matching and demanding difficult reasoning
based on single-or-multiple-sentence information. We conduct experiments using different types
of machine reading comprehension methods to achieve the first baseline performances, compared
with further models' performances. We also measure human performance on the corpus and compared
it with several powerful neural network-based and transfer learning-based models. Our experiments
show that the best machine model is ALBERT, which achieves an exact match score of 65.26% and an F1-score
of 84.89% on our corpus. The significant differences between humans and the best-performance model
(14.53% of EM and 10.90% of F1-score) on the test set of our corpus indicate that improvements in ViNewsQA
could be explored in the future study. Our corpus is publicly available on our website for the research
purpose to encourage the research community to make these improvements.

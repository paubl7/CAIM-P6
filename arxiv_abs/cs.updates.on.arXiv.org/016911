Bayesian optimization is a promising methodology for analog circuit synthesis. However, the sequential
nature of the Bayesian optimization framework significantly limits its ability to fully utilize
real-world computational resources. In this paper, we propose an efficient parallelizable Bayesian
optimization algorithm via Multi-objective ACquisition function Ensemble (MACE) to further
accelerate the optimization procedure. By sampling query points from the Pareto front of the probability
of improvement (PI), expected improvement (EI) and lower confidence bound (LCB), we combine the
benefits of state-of-the-art acquisition functions to achieve a delicate tradeoff between exploration
and exploitation for the unconstrained optimization problem. Based on this batch design, we further
adjust the algorithm for the constrained optimization problem. By dividing the optimization procedure
into two stages and first focusing on finding an initial feasible point, we manage to gain more information
about the valid region and can better avoid sampling around the infeasible area. After achieving
the first feasible point, we favor the feasible region by adopting a specially designed penalization
term to the acquisition function ensemble. The experimental results quantitatively demonstrate
that our proposed algorithm can reduce the overall simulation time by up to 74 times compared to differential
evolution (DE) for the unconstrained optimization problem when the batch size is 15. For the constrained
optimization problem, our proposed algorithm can speed up the optimization process by up to 15 times
compared to the weighted expected improvement based Bayesian optimization (WEIBO) approach,
when the batch size is 15.

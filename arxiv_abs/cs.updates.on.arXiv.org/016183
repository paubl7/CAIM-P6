State-of-the-art Model Predictive Control (MPC) applications for building heating adopt either
a deterministic controller together with a nonlinear model or a linearized model with a stochastic
MPC controller. However, deterministic MPC only considers one single realization of the disturbances
and its performance strongly depends on the quality of the forecast of the disturbances, which can
lead to low performance. In fact, inadequate building energy management can lead to high energy
costs and CO$_2$ emissions. On the other hand, a linearized model can fail to capture some dynamics
and behavior of the building under control. In this article, we combine a stochastic scenario-based
MPC (SBMPC) controller together with a nonlinear Modelica model that is able to provide a richer
building description and to capture the dynamics of the building more accurately than linear models.
The adopted SBMPC controller considers multiple realizations of the external disturbances obtained
through a statistically accurate model, so as to consider different possible disturbance evolutions
and to robustify the control action. To this purpose, we present a scenario generation method for
building temperature control that can be applied to several exogenous perturbations, e.g.\ solar
irradiance, outside temperature, and that satisfies several important stastistical properties,
in contrast with simpler and less accurate methods adopted in the literature. We show the benefits
of our proposed approach through several simulations in which we compare our method against the
standard ones from the literature, for several combinations of a trade-off parameter between comfort
and energy cost. We show how our SBMPC controller approach outperforms the standard controllers
available in the literature.

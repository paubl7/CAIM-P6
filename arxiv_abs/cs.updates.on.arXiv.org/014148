The graph matching problem emerges naturally in various applications such as web privacy, image
processing and computational biology. In this paper, graph matching is considered under a stochastic
model, where a pair of randomly generated graphs with pairwise correlated edges are to be matched
such that given the labeling of the vertices in the first graph, the labels in the second graph are
recovered by leveraging the correlation among their edges. The problem is considered under various
settings and graph models. In the first step, the Correlated Erd\"{o}s-R\'enyi (CER) graph model
is studied, where all edge pairs whose vertices have similar labels are generated based on identical
distributions and independently of other edges. A matching scheme called the \textit{typicality
matching scheme} is introduced. The scheme operates by investigating the joint typicality of the
adjacency matrices of the two graphs. New results on the typicality of permutations of sequences
lead to necessary and sufficient conditions for successful matching based on the parameters of
the CER model. In the next step, the results are extended to graphs with community structure generated
based on the Stochastic Block Model (SBM). The SBM model is a generalization of the CER model where
each vertex in the graph is associated with a community label, which affects its edge statistics.
The results are further extended to matching of ensembles of more than two correlated graphs. Lastly,
the problem of seeded graph matching is investigated where a subset of the labels in the second graph
are known prior to matching. In this scenario, in addition to obtaining necessary and sufficient
conditions for successful matching, a polytime matching algorithm is proposed.

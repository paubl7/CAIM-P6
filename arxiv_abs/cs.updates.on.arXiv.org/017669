Social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDoH) have important roles in shaping people's
health. In clinical research studies, especially comparative effectiveness studies, failure
to adjust for SBDoH factors will potentially cause confounding issues and misclassification errors
in either statistical analyses and machine learning-based models. However, there are limited
studies to examine SBDoH factors in clinical outcomes due to the lack of structured SBDoH information
in current electronic health record (EHR) systems, while much of the SBDoH information is documented
in clinical narratives. Natural language processing (NLP) is thus the key technology to extract
such information from unstructured clinical text. However, there is not a mature clinical NLP system
focusing on SBDoH. In this study, we examined two state-of-the-art transformer-based NLP models,
including BERT and RoBERTa, to extract SBDoH concepts from clinical narratives, applied the best
performing model to extract SBDoH concepts on a lung cancer screening patient cohort, and examined
the difference of SBDoH information between NLP extracted results and structured EHRs (SBDoH information
captured in standard vocabularies such as the International Classification of Diseases codes).
The experimental results show that the BERT-based NLP model achieved the best strict/lenient F1-score
of 0.8791 and 0.8999, respectively. The comparison between NLP extracted SBDoH information and
structured EHRs in the lung cancer patient cohort of 864 patients with 161,933 various types of clinical
notes showed that much more detailed information about smoking, education, and employment were
only captured in clinical narratives and that it is necessary to use both clinical narratives and
structured EHRs to construct a more complete picture of patients' SBDoH factors.

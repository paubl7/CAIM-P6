Accurate mapping of oil palm is important for understanding its past and future impact on the environment.
We propose to map and count oil palms by estimating tree densities per pixel for large-scale analysis.
This allows for fine-grained analysis, for example regarding different planting patterns. To
that end, we propose a new, active deep learning method to estimate oil palm density at large scale
from Sentinel-2 satellite images, and apply it to generate complete maps for Malaysia and Indonesia.
What makes the regression of oil palm density challenging is the need for representative reference
data that covers all relevant geographical conditions across a large territory. Specifically
for density estimation, generating reference data involves counting individual trees. To keep
the associated labelling effort low we propose an active learning (AL) approach that automatically
chooses the most relevant samples to be labelled. Our method relies on estimates of the epistemic
model uncertainty and of the diversity among samples, making it possible to retrieve an entire batch
of relevant samples in a single iteration. Moreover, our algorithm has linear computational complexity
and is easily parallelisable to cover large areas. We use our method to compute the first oil palm
density map with $10\,$m Ground Sampling Distance (GSD) , for all of Indonesia and Malaysia and for
two different years, 2017 and 2019. The maps have a mean absolute error of $\pm$7.3 trees/$ha$, estimated
from an independent validation set. We also analyse density variations between different states
within a country and compare them to official estimates. According to our estimates there are, in
total, $>1.2$ billion oil palms in Indonesia covering $>$15 million $ha$, and $>0.5$ billion oil
palms in Malaysia covering $>6$ million $ha$.

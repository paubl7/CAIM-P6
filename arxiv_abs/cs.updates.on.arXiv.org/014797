The control of modern buildings is, on one hand, a complex multi-variable control problem due to
the integration of renewable energy generation devices, storage devices, and connection of electrical
vehicles (EVs), and, on the other hand, a complex multi-criteria problem due to requirements for
overall energy minimization and comfort satisfaction. Both conventional rule-based (RB) and
advanced model-based controllers, such as model predictive control (MPC), cannot fulfil the current
building automation industry requirements of achieving system-wide optimal performance of a
modern building at low commissioning and maintenance costs. In this work, we present a fully black-box,
data-driven method to obtain a control policy for a multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) problem in
buildings -- the joint control of a room temperature and a bidirectional EV charging -- with the aim
to maximize occupants comfort and energy savings while leaving enough energy in the EV battery for
the next trip. We modelled the room temperature and EV charging using recurrent neural networks
and a piece-wise linear function, respectively, and used these models as a simulation environment
for the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning algorithm to find an
optimal control policy. In the simulation, the DDPG control agent achieved on average 17% energy
savings and 19% better comfort during the heating season compared to a standard RB controller. Similarly,
for the joint room heating and bidirectional EV charging control, the DDPG MIMO controller achieved
on average 12% better comfort satisfaction, 11% energy savings, and 42% energy costs savings compared
to two standard RB controllers. We also validated the method on the DFAB HOUSE at Empa, Duebendorf,
in Switzerland where we obtained 27% energy savings at better comfort over three weeks during the
heating season.

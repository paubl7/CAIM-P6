The variety of services and functionality offered by various cloud service providers (CSP) have
exploded lately. Utilizing such services has created numerous opportunities for enterprises
infrastructure to become cloud-based and, in turn, assisted the enterprises to easily and flexibly
offer services to their customers. The practice of renting out access to servers to clients for computing
and storage purposes is known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The popularity of IaaS has led
to serious and critical concerns with respect to the cyber security and privacy. In particular,
malware is often leveraged by malicious entities against cloud services to compromise sensitive
data or to obstruct their functionality. In response to this growing menace, malware detection
for cloud environments has become a widely researched topic with numerous methods being proposed
and deployed. In this paper, we present online malware detection based on process level performance
metrics, and analyze the effectiveness of different baseline machine learning models including,
Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), KNearest Neighbor (KNN), Gradient
Boosted Classifier (GBC), Gaussian Naive Bayes (GNB) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN).
Our analysis conclude that neural network models can most accurately detect the impact malware
have on the process level features of virtual machines in the cloud, and therefore are best suited
to detect them. Our models were trained, validated, and tested by using a dataset of 40,680 malicious
and benign samples. The dataset was complied by running different families of malware (collected
from VirusTotal) in a live cloud environment and collecting the process level features.

Tuberculosis (TB) is a top-10 cause of death worldwide. Though the WHO recommends chest radiographs
(CXRs) for TB screening, the limited availability of CXR interpretation is a barrier. We trained
a deep learning system (DLS) to detect active pulmonary TB using CXRs from 9 countries across Africa,
Asia, and Europe, and utilized large-scale CXR pretraining, attention pooling, and noisy student
semi-supervised learning. Evaluation was on (1) a combined test set spanning China, India, US,
and Zambia, and (2) an independent mining population in South Africa. Given WHO targets of 90% sensitivity
and 70% specificity, the DLS's operating point was prespecified to favor sensitivity over specificity.
On the combined test set, the DLS's ROC curve was above all 9 India-based radiologists, with an AUC
of 0.90 (95%CI 0.87-0.92). The DLS's sensitivity (88%) was higher than the India-based radiologists
(75% mean sensitivity), p<0.001 for superiority; and its specificity (79%) was non-inferior to
the radiologists (84% mean specificity), p=0.004. Similar trends were observed within HIV positive
and sputum smear positive sub-groups, and in the South Africa test set. We found that 5 US-based radiologists
(where TB isn't endemic) were more sensitive and less specific than the India-based radiologists
(where TB is endemic). The DLS also remained non-inferior to the US-based radiologists. In simulations,
using the DLS as a prioritization tool for confirmatory testing reduced the cost per positive case
detected by 40-80% compared to using confirmatory testing alone. To conclude, our DLS generalized
to 5 countries, and merits prospective evaluation to assist cost-effective screening efforts
in radiologist-limited settings. Operating point flexibility may permit customization of the
DLS to account for site-specific factors such as TB prevalence, demographics, clinical resources,
and customary practice patterns.

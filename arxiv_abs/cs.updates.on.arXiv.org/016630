Machine learning is revolutionizing image-based diagnostics in pathology and radiology. ML models
have shown promising results in research settings, but their lack of interoperability has been
a major barrier for clinical integration and evaluation. The DICOM a standard specifies Information
Object Definitions and Services for the representation and communication of digital images and
related information, including image-derived annotations and analysis results. However, the
complexity of the standard represents an obstacle for its adoption in the ML community and creates
a need for software libraries and tools that simplify working with data sets in DICOM format. Here
we present the highdicom library, which provides a high-level application programming interface
for the Python programming language that abstracts low-level details of the standard and enables
encoding and decoding of image-derived information in DICOM format in a few lines of Python code.
The highdicom library ties into the extensive Python ecosystem for image processing and machine
learning. Simultaneously, by simplifying creation and parsing of DICOM-compliant files, highdicom
achieves interoperability with the medical imaging systems that hold the data used to train and
run ML models, and ultimately communicate and store model outputs for clinical use. We demonstrate
through experiments with slide microscopy and computed tomography imaging, that, by bridging
these two ecosystems, highdicom enables developers to train and evaluate state-of-the-art ML
models in pathology and radiology while remaining compliant with the DICOM standard and interoperable
with clinical systems at all stages. To promote standardization of ML research and streamline the
ML model development and deployment process, we made the library available free and open-source.

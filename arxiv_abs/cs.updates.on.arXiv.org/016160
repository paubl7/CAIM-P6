Purpose: To develop an algorithm for robust partial Fourier (PF) reconstruction applicable to
diffusion-weighted (DW) images with non-smooth phase variations. Methods: Based on an unrolled
proximal splitting algorithm, a neural network architecture is derived which alternates between
data consistency operations and regularization implemented by recurrent convolutions. In order
to exploit correlations, multiple repetitions of the same slice are jointly reconstructed under
consideration of permutation-equivariance. The proposed method is trained on DW liver data of
60 volunteers and evaluated on retrospectively and prospectively sub-sampled data of different
anatomies and resolutions. In addition, the benefits of using a recurrent network over other unrolling
strategies is investigated. Results: Conventional PF techniques can be significantly outperformed
in terms of quantitative measures as well as perceptual image quality. The proposed method is able
to generalize well to brain data with contrasts and resolution not present in the training set. The
reduction in echo time (TE) associated with prospective PF-sampling enables DW imaging with higher
signal. Also, the TE increase in acquisitions with higher resolution can be compensated for. It
can be shown that unrolling by means of a recurrent network produced better results than using a weight-shared
network or a cascade of networks. Conclusion: This work demonstrates that robust PF reconstruction
of DW data is feasible even at strong PF factors in applications with severe phase variations. Since
the proposed method does not rely on smoothness priors of the phase but uses learned recurrent convolutions
instead, artifacts of conventional PF methods can be avoided.

In this paper, we introduce a framework for segmenting instances of a common object class by multiple
active contour evolution over semantic segmentation maps of images obtained through fully convolutional
networks. The contour evolution is cast as an energy minimization problem, where the aggregate
energy functional incorporates a data fit term, an explicit shape model, and accounts for object
overlap. Efficient solution neighborhood operators are proposed, enabling optimization through
metaheuristics such as simulated annealing. We instantiate the proposed framework in the context
of segmenting individual fallen stems from high-resolution aerial multispectral imagery. We
validated our approach on 3 real-world scenes of varying complexity. The test plots were situated
in regions of the Bavarian Forest National Park, Germany, which sustained a heavy bark beetle infestation.
Evaluations were performed on both the polygon and line segment level, showing that the multi-contour
segmentation can achieve up to 0.93 precision and 0.82 recall. An improvement of up to 7 percentage
points (pp) in recall and 6 in precision compared to an iterative sample consensus line segment detection
was achieved. Despite the simplicity of the applied shape parametrization, an explicit shape model
incorporated into the energy function improved the results by up to 4 pp of recall. Finally, we show
the importance of using a deep learning based semantic segmentation method as the basis for individual
stem detection. Our method is a step towards increased accessibility of automatic fallen tree mapping,
due to higher cost efficiency of aerial imagery acquisition compared to laser scanning. The precise
fallen tree maps could be further used as a basis for plant and animal habitat modeling, studies on
carbon sequestration as well as soil quality in forest ecosystems.

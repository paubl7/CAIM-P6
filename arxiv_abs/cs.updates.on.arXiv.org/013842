Background: A growing amount of software is available to children today. Children use both software
that has been explicitly developed for them and software for general users. While they obtain clear
benefits from software, such as access to creativity tools and learning resources, children are
also exposed to several risks and disadvantages, such as privacy violation, inactivity, or safety
risks that can even lead to death. The research and development community is addressing and investigating
positive and negative impacts of software for children one by one, but no comprehensive model exists
that relates software engineering and children as stakeholders in their own right. Aims: The final
objective of this line of research is to propose effective ways in which children can be involved
in Software Engineering activities as stakeholders. Specifically, in this paper, we investigate
the quality aspects that are of interest for children, as quality is a crucial aspect in the development
of any kind of software, especially for stakeholders like children. Method: Our contribution is
based mainly on an analysis of studies at the intersection between Software Engineering (especially
software quality) and Child Computer Interaction. Results: We identify a set of qualities and a
preliminary set of guidelines that can be used by researchers and practitioners in understanding
the complex interrelations between Software Engineering and children. Based on the qualities
and the guidelines, researchers can design empirical investigations to obtain deeper insights
into the phenomenon and propose new Software Engineering knowledge specific for this type of stakeholders.
Conclusions: This conceptualization is a first step towards a framework to support children as
stakeholders in software engineering.

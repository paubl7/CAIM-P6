Permissioned blockchains are becoming popular as data management systems in the enterprise setting.
Compared to traditional distributed databases, blockchain platforms provide increased security
guarantees but significantly lower performance. Further, these platforms are quite expensive
to run for the low throughput they provide. The following are two ways to improve performance and
reduce cost: (1) make the system utilize allocated resources efficiently; (2) allow rapid and dynamic
scaling of allocated resources based on load. We explore both of these in this work. We first investigate
the reasons for the poor performance and scalability of the dominant permissioned blockchain flavor
called Execute-Order-Validate (EOV). We do this by studying the scaling characteristics of Hyperledger
Fabric, a popular EOV platform, using vertical scaling and horizontal scaling. We find that the
transaction throughput scales very poorly with these techniques. At least in the permissioned
setting, the real bottleneck is transaction processing, not the consensus protocol. With vertical
scaling, the allocated vCPUs go under-utilized. In contrast, with horizontal scaling, the allocated
resources get wasted due to redundant work across nodes within an organization. To mitigate the
above concerns, we first improve resource efficiency by (a) improving CPU utilization with a pipelined
execution of validation & commit phases; (b) avoiding redundant work across nodes by introducing
a new type of peer node called sparse peer that selectively commits transactions. We further propose
a technique that enables the rapid scaling of resources. Our implementation - SmartFabric, built
on top of Hyperledger Fabric demonstrates 3x higher throughput, 12-26x faster scale-up time, and
provides Fabric's throughput at 50% to 87% lower cost.

Cognitive decline due to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is closely associated with brain structure alterations
captured by structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI). It supports the validity to develop
sMRI-based univariate neurodegeneration biomarkers (UNB). However, existing UNB work either
fails to model large group variances or does not capture AD dementia (ADD) induced changes. We propose
a novel low-rank and sparse subspace decomposition method capable of stably quantifying the morphological
changes induced by ADD. Specifically, we propose a numerically efficient rank minimization mechanism
to extract group common structure and impose regularization constraints to encode the original
3D morphometry connectivity. Further, we generate regions-of-interest (ROI) with group difference
study between common subspaces of $A\beta+$ AD and $A\beta-$ cognitively unimpaired (CU) groups.
A univariate morphometry index (UMI) is constructed from these ROIs by summarizing individual
morphological characteristics weighted by normalized difference between $A\beta+$ AD and $A\beta-$
CU groups. We use hippocampal surface radial distance feature to compute the UMIs and validate our
work in the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) cohort. With hippocampal UMIs,
the estimated minimum sample sizes needed to detect a 25$\%$ reduction in the mean annual change
with 80$\%$ power and two-tailed $P=0.05$ are 116, 279 and 387 for the longitudinal $A\beta+$ AD,
$A\beta+$ mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and $A\beta+$ CU groups, respectively. Additionally,
for MCI patients, UMIs well correlate with hazard ratio of conversion to AD ($4.3$, $95\%$ CI=$2.3-8.2$)
within 18 months. Our experimental results outperform traditional hippocampal volume measures
and suggest the application of UMI as a potential UNB.

We develop an approach to choice principles and their contrapositive bar-induction principles
as extensionality schemes connecting an "intensional" or "effective" view of respectively ill-and
well-foundedness properties to an "extensional" or "ideal" view of these properties. After classifying
and analysing the relations between different intensional definitions of ill-foundedness and
well-foundedness, we introduce, for a domain $A$, a codomain $B$ and a "filter" $T$ on finite approximations
of functions from $A$ to $B$, a generalised form GDC$_{A,B,T}$ of the axiom of dependent choice and
dually a generalised bar induction principle GBI$_{A,B,T}$ such that: GDC$_{A,B,T}$ intuitionistically
captures the strength of $\bullet$ the general axiom of choice expressed as $\forall a\exists b
R(a, b) \Rightarrow\exists\alpha\forall \alpha R(\alpha,\alpha(a))$ when $T$ is a filter that
derives point-wise from a relation $R$ on $A \times B$ without introducing further constraints,
$\bullet$ the Boolean Prime Filter Theorem / Ultrafilter Theorem if $B$ is the two-element set $\mathbb{B}$
(for a constructive definition of prime filter), $\bullet$ the axiom of dependent choice if $A =
\mathbb{N}$, $\bullet$ Weak K{\"o}nig's Lemma if $A = \mathbb{N}$ and $B = \mathbb{B}$ (up to weak
classical reasoning) GBI$_{A,B,T}$ intuitionistically captures the strength of $\bullet$ G{\"o}del's
completeness theorem in the form validity implies provability for entailment relations if $B =
\mathbb{B}$, $\bullet$ bar induction when $A = \mathbb{N}$, $\bullet$ the Weak Fan Theorem when
$A = \mathbb{N}$ and $B = \mathbb{B}$. Contrastingly, even though GDC$_{A,B,T}$ and GBI$_{A,B,T}$
smoothly capture several variants of choice and bar induction, some instances are inconsistent,
e.g. when $A$ is $\mathbb{B}^\mathbb{N}$ and $B$ is $\mathbb{N}$.

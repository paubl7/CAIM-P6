The emerging space-air-ground integrated network has attracted intensive research and necessitates
reliable and efficient aeronautical communications. This paper investigates terahertz Ultra-Massive
(UM)-MIMO-based aeronautical communications and proposes an effective channel estimation and
tracking scheme, which can solve the performance degradation problem caused by the unique {\emph{triple
delay-beam-Doppler squint effects}} of aeronautical terahertz UM-MIMO channels. Specifically,
based on the rough angle estimates acquired from navigation information, an initial aeronautical
link is established, where the delay-beam squint at transceiver can be significantly mitigated
by employing a Grouping True-Time Delay Unit (GTTDU) module (e.g., the designed {\emph{Rotman
lens}}-based GTTDU module). According to the proposed prior-aided iterative angle estimation
algorithm, azimuth/elevation angles can be estimated, and these angles are adopted to achieve
precise beam-alignment and refine GTTDU module for further eliminating delay-beam squint. Doppler
shifts can be subsequently estimated using the proposed prior-aided iterative Doppler shift estimation
algorithm. On this basis, path delays and channel gains can be estimated accurately, where the Doppler
squint can be effectively attenuated via compensation process. For data transmission, a data-aided
decision-directed based channel tracking algorithm is developed to track the beam-aligned effective
channels. When the data-aided channel tracking is invalid, angles will be re-estimated at the pilot-aided
channel tracking stage with an equivalent sparse digital array, where angle ambiguity can be resolved
based on the previously estimated angles. The simulation results and the derived Cram\'{e}r-Rao
lower bounds verify the effectiveness of our solution.

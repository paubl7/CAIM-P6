Ride-hailing platforms generally provide various service options to customers, such as solo ride
services, shared ride services, etc. It is generally expected that demands for different service
modes are correlated, and the prediction of demand for one service mode can benefit from historical
observations of demands for other service modes. Moreover, an accurate joint prediction of demands
for multiple service modes can help the platforms better allocate and dispatch vehicle resources.
Although there is a large stream of literature on ride-hailing demand predictions for one specific
service mode, little efforts have been paid towards joint predictions of ride-hailing demands
for multiple service modes. To address this issue, we propose a deep multi-task multi-graph learning
approach, which combines two components: (1) multiple multi-graph convolutional (MGC) networks
for predicting demands for different service modes, and (2) multi-task learning modules that enable
knowledge sharing across multiple MGC networks. More specifically, two multi-task learning structures
are established. The first one is the regularized cross-task learning, which builds cross-task
connections among the inputs and outputs of multiple MGC networks. The second one is the multi-linear
relationship learning, which imposes a prior tensor normal distribution on the weights of various
MGC networks. Although there are no concrete bridges between different MGC networks, the weights
of these networks are constrained by each other and subject to a common prior distribution. Evaluated
with the for-hire-vehicle datasets in Manhattan, we show that our propose approach outperforms
the benchmark algorithms in prediction accuracy for different ride-hailing modes.

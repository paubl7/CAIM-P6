Malicious activities in cyberspace have gone further than simply hacking machines and spreading
viruses. It has become a challenge for a nations survival and hence has evolved to cyber warfare.
Malware is a key component of cyber-crime, and its analysis is the first line of defence against attack.
This work proposes a novel deep boosted hybrid learning-based malware classification framework
and named as Deep boosted Feature Space-based Malware classification (DFS-MC). In the proposed
framework, the discrimination power is enhanced by fusing the feature spaces of the best performing
customized CNN architectures models and its discrimination by an SVM for classification. The discrimination
capacity of the proposed classification framework is assessed by comparing it against the standard
customized CNNs. The customized CNN models are implemented in two ways: softmax classifier and
deep hybrid learning-based malware classification. In the hybrid learning, Deep features are
extracted from customized CNN architectures and fed into the conventional machine learning classifier
to improve the classification performance. We also introduced the concept of transfer learning
in a customized CNN architecture based malware classification framework through fine-tuning.
The performance of the proposed malware classification approaches are validated on the MalImg
malware dataset using the hold-out cross-validation technique. Experimental comparisons were
conducted by employing innovative, customized CNN, trained from scratch and fine-tuning the customized
CNN using transfer learning. The proposed classification framework DFS-MC showed improved results,
Accuracy: 98.61%, F-score: 0.96, Precision: 0.96, and Recall: 0.96.

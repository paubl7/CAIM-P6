Geometric and dimensional variations in objects are caused by inevitable uncertainties in manufacturing
processes and often lead to product quality issues. Failing to model the effect object shape errors,
i.e., geometric and dimensional errors of parts, early during design phase inhibits the ability
to predict such quality issues; consequently leading to expensive design changes after freezing
of design. State-of-Art methodologies for modelling and simulating object shape error have limited
defect fidelity, data versatility, and designer centricity that prevent their effective application
during early design phase. Overcoming these limitations a novel Morphing Gaussian Random Field
(MGRF) methodology for object shape error modelling and simulation is presented in this paper.
The MGRF methodology has (i) high defect fidelity and is capable of simulating various part defects
including local and global deformations, and technological patterns; (ii) high data versatility
and can effectively simulate non-ideal parts under the constraint of limited data availability
and can utilise historical non-ideal part data; (iii) designer centric capabilities such as performing
`what if?' analysis of practically relevant defects; and (iv) capability to generate non-ideal
parts conforming to statistical form tolerance specification. The aforementioned capabilities
enable MGRF methodology to accurately model and simulate the effect of object shape variations
on product quality during the early design phase. This is achieved by first, modelling the spatial
correlation in the deviations of the part from its design nominal using Gaussian Random Field and
then, utilising the modelled spatial correlations to generate non-ideal parts by conditional
simulations. Practical applications of developed MGRF methodology and its advantages are demonstrated
using sport-utility-vehicle door parts.

Modern vehicles, including connected vehicles and autonomous vehicles, nowadays involve many
electronic control units connected through intra-vehicle networks to implement various functionalities
and perform actions. Modern vehicles are also connected to external networks through vehicle-to-everything
technologies, enabling their communications with other vehicles, infrastructures, and smart
devices. However, the improving functionality and connectivity of modern vehicles also increase
their vulnerabilities to cyber-attacks targeting both intra-vehicle and external networks due
to the large attack surfaces. To secure vehicular networks, many researchers have focused on developing
intrusion detection systems (IDSs) that capitalize on machine learning methods to detect malicious
cyber-attacks. In this paper, the vulnerabilities of intra-vehicle and external networks are
discussed, and a multi-tiered hybrid IDS that incorporates a signature-based IDS and an anomaly-based
IDS is proposed to detect both known and unknown attacks on vehicular networks. Experimental results
illustrate that the proposed system can detect various types of known attacks with 99.99% accuracy
on the CAN-intrusion-dataset representing the intra-vehicle network data and 99.88% accuracy
on the CICIDS2017 dataset illustrating the external vehicular network data. For the zero-day attack
detection, the proposed system achieves high F1-scores of 0.963 and 0.800 on the above two datasets,
respectively. The average processing time of each data packet on a vehicle-level machine is less
than 0.6 ms, which shows the feasibility of implementing the proposed system in real-time vehicle
systems. This emphasizes the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed IDS.

Among the most important graph parameters is the Diameter, the largest distance between any two
vertices. There are no known very efficient algorithms for computing the Diameter exactly. Thus,
much research has been devoted to how fast this parameter can be approximated. Chechik et al. showed
that the diameter can be approximated within a multiplicative factor of $3/2$ in $\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$
time. Furthermore, Roditty and Vassilevska W. showed that unless the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis
(SETH) fails, no $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor better
than $3/2$ in sparse graphs. Thus the above algorithm is essentially optimal for sparse graphs for
approximation factors less than $3/2$. It was, however, completely plausible that a $3/2$-approximation
is possible in linear time. In this work we conditionally rule out such a possibility by showing that
unless SETH fails no $O(m^{3/2-\epsilon})$ time algorithm can achieve an approximation factor
better than $5/3$. Another fundamental set of graph parameters are the Eccentricities. The Eccentricity
of a vertex $v$ is the distance between $v$ and the farthest vertex from $v$. Chechik et al. showed
that the Eccentricities of all vertices can be approximated within a factor of $5/3$ in $\tilde{O}(m^{3/2})$
time and Abboud et al. showed that no $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ algorithm can achieve better than $5/3$
approximation in sparse graphs. We show that the runtime of the $5/3$ approximation algorithm is
also optimal under SETH. We also show that no near-linear time algorithm can achieve a better than
$2$ approximation for the Eccentricities and that this is essentially tight: we give an algorithm
that approximates Eccentricities within a $2+\delta$ factor in $\tilde{O}(m/\delta)$ time for
any $0<\delta<1$. This beats all Eccentricity algorithms in Cairo et al.

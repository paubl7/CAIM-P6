Providing pedestrians and other vulnerable road users with a clear indication about a fully autonomous
vehicle status and intentions is crucial to make them coexist. In the last few years, a variety of
external interfaces have been proposed, leveraging different paradigms and technologies including
vehicle-mounted devices (like LED panels), short-range on-road projections, and road infrastructure
interfaces (e.g., special asphalts with embedded displays). These designs were experimented
in different settings, using mockups, specially prepared vehicles, or virtual environments,
with heterogeneous evaluation metrics. Promising interfaces based on Augmented Reality (AR)
have been proposed too, but their usability and effectiveness have not been tested yet. This paper
aims to complement such body of literature by presenting a comparison of state-of-the-art interfaces
and new designs under common conditions. To this aim, an immersive Virtual Reality-based simulation
was developed, recreating a well-known scenario represented by pedestrians crossing in urban
environments under non-regulated conditions. A user study was then performed to investigate the
various dimensions of vehicle-to-pedestrian interaction leveraging objective and subjective
metrics. Even though no interface clearly stood out over all the considered dimensions, one of the
AR designs achieved state-of-the-art results in terms of safety and trust, at the cost of higher
cognitive effort and lower intuitiveness compared to LED panels showing anthropomorphic features.
Together with rankings on the various dimensions, indications about advantages and drawbacks
of the various alternatives that emerged from this study could provide important information for
next developments in the field.

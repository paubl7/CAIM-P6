Sparse polynomial interpolation, sparse linear system solving or modular rational reconstruction
are fundamental problems in Computer Algebra. They come down to computing linear recurrence relations
of a sequence with the Berlekamp-Massey algorithm. Likewise, sparse multivariate polynomial
interpolation and multidimensional cyclic code decoding require guessing linear recurrence
relations of a multivariate sequence.Several algorithms solve this problem. The so-called Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata
algorithm (1988) uses polynomial additions and shifts by a monomial. The Scalar-FGLM algorithm
(2015) relies on linear algebra operations on a multi-Hankel matrix, a multivariate generalization
of a Hankel matrix. The Artinian Gorenstein border basis algorithm (2017) uses a Gram-Schmidt process.We
propose a new algorithm for computing the Gr{\"o}bner basis of the ideal of relations of a sequence
based solely on multivariate polynomial arithmetic. This algorithm allows us to both revisit the
Berlekamp-Massey-Sakata algorithm through the use of polynomial divisions and to completely
revise the Scalar-FGLM algorithm without linear algebra operations.A key observation in the design
of this algorithm is to work on the mirror of the truncated generating series allowing us to use polynomial
arithmetic modulo a monomial ideal. It appears to have some similarities with Pad{\'e} approximants
of this mirror polynomial.As an addition from the paper published at the ISSAC conferance, we give
an adaptive variant of this algorithm taking into account the shape of the final Gr{\"o}bner basis
gradually as it is discovered. The main advantage of this algorithm is that its complexity in terms
of operations and sequence queries only depends on the output Gr{\"o}bner basis.All these algorithms
have been implemented in Maple and we report on our comparisons.

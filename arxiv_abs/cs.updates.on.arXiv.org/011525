Responding to user reviews promptly and satisfactorily improves application ratings, which is
key to application popularity and success. The proliferation of such reviews makes it virtually
impossible for developers to keep up with responding manually. To address this challenge, recent
work has shown the possibility of automatic response generation. However, because the training
review-response pairs are aggregated from many different apps, it remains challenging for such
models to generate app-specific responses, which, on the other hand, are often desirable as apps
have different features and concerns. Solving the challenge by simply building a model per app (i.e.,
training with review-response pairs of a single app) may be insufficient because individual apps
have limited review-response pairs, and such pairs typically lack the relevant information needed
to respond to a new review. To enable app-specific response generation, this work proposes AARSynth:
an app-aware response synthesis system. The key idea behind AARSynth is to augment the seq2seq model
with information specific to a given app. Given a new user review, it first retrieves the top-K most
relevant app reviews and the most relevant snippet from the app description. The retrieved information
and the new user review are then fed into a fused machine learning model that integrates the seq2seq
model with a machine reading comprehension model. The latter helps digest the retrieved reviews
and app description. Finally, the fused model generates a response that is customized to the given
app. We evaluated AARSynth using a large corpus of reviews and responses from Google Play. The results
show that AARSynth outperforms the state-of-the-art system by 22.2% on BLEU-4 score. Furthermore,
our human study shows that AARSynth produces a statistically significant improvement in response
quality compared to the state-of-the-art system.

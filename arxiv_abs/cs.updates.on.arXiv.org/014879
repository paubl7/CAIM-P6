We study approximate-near-neighbor data structures for time series under the continuous Fr\'echet
distance. For an attainable approximation factor $c>1$ and a query radius $r$, an approximate-near-neighbor
data structure can be used to preprocess $n$ curves in $\mathbb{R}$ (aka time series), each of complexity
$m$, to answer queries with a curve of complexity $k$ by either returning a curve that lies within
Fr\'echet distance $cr$, or answering that there exists no curve in the input within distance $r$.
In both cases, the answer is correct. Our first data structure achieves a $(5+\epsilon)$ approximation
factor, uses space in $n\cdot \mathcal{O}\left({\epsilon^{-1}}\right)^{k} + \mathcal{O}(nm)$
and has query time in $\mathcal{O}\left(k\right)$. Our second data structure achieves a $(2+\epsilon)$
approximation factor, uses space in $n\cdot \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{m}{k\epsilon}\right)^{k}
+ \mathcal{O}(nm)$ and has query time in $\mathcal{O}\left(k\cdot 2^k\right)$. Our third positive
result is a probabilistic data structure based on locality-sensitive hashing, which achieves
space in $\mathcal{O}(n\log n+nm)$ and query time in $\mathcal{O}(k\log n)$, and which answers
queries with an approximation factor in $\mathcal{O}(k)$. All of our data structures make use of
the concept of signatures, which were originally introduced for the problem of clustering time
series under the Fr\'echet distance. In addition, we show lower bounds for this problem. Consider
any data structure which achieves an approximation factor less than $2$ and which supports curves
of arclength up to $L$ and answers the query using only a constant number of probes. We show that under
reasonable assumptions on the word size any such data structure needs space in $L^{\Omega(k)}$.

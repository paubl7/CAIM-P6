The application of computer vision for COVID-19 diagnosis is complex and challenging, given the
risks associated with patient misclassifications. Arguably, the primary value of medical imaging
for COVID-19 lies rather on patient prognosis. Radiological images can guide physicians assessing
the severity of the disease, and a series of images from the same patient at different stages can help
to gauge disease progression. Based on these premises, a simple method based on lung-pathology
features for scoring disease severity from Chest X-rays is proposed here. As the primary contribution,
this method shows to be correlated to patient severity in different stages of disease progression
comparatively well when contrasted with other existing methods. An original approach for data
selection is also proposed, allowing the simple model to learn the severity-related features.
It is hypothesized that the resulting competitive performance presented here is related to the
method being feature-based rather than reliant on lung involvement or compromise as others in the
literature. The fact that it is simpler and interpretable than other end-to-end, more complex models,
also sets aside this work. As the data set is small, bias-inducing artifacts that could lead to overfitting
are minimized through an image normalization and lung segmentation step at the learning phase.
A second contribution comes from the validation of the results, conceptualized as the scoring of
patients groups from different stages of the disease. Besides performing such validation on an
independent data set, the results were also compared with other proposed scoring methods in the
literature. The expressive results show that although imaging alone is not sufficient for assessing
severity as a whole, there is a strong correlation with the scoring system, termed as MAVIDH score,
with patient outcome.

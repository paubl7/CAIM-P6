In $k$-Digraph Coloring we are given a digraph and are asked to partition its vertices into at most
$k$ sets, so that each set induces a DAG. This well-known problem is NP-hard, as it generalizes (undirected)
$k$-Coloring, but becomes trivial if the input digraph is acyclic. This poses the natural parameterized
complexity question what happens when the input is "almost" acyclic. In this paper we study this
question using parameters that measure the input's distance to acyclicity in either the directed
or the undirected sense. It is already known that, for all $k\ge 2$, $k$-Digraph Coloring is NP-hard
on digraphs of DFVS at most $k+4$. We strengthen this result to show that, for all $k\ge 2$, $k$-Digraph
Coloring is NP-hard for DFVS $k$. Refining our reduction we obtain two further consequences: (i)
for all $k\ge 2$, $k$-Digraph Coloring is NP-hard for graphs of feedback arc set (FAS) at most $k^2$;
interestingly, this leads to a dichotomy, as we show that the problem is FPT by $k$ if FAS is at most
$k^2-1$; (ii) $k$-Digraph Coloring is NP-hard for graphs of DFVS $k$, even if the maximum degree
$\Delta$ is at most $4k-1$; we show that this is also almost tight, as the problem becomes FPT for DFVS
$k$ and $\Delta\le 4k-3$. We then consider parameters that measure the distance from acyclicity
of the underlying graph. We show that $k$-Digraph Coloring admits an FPT algorithm parameterized
by treewidth, whose parameter dependence is $(tw!)k^{tw}$. Then, we pose the question of whether
the $tw!$ factor can be eliminated. Our main contribution in this part is to settle this question
in the negative and show that our algorithm is essentially optimal, even for the much more restricted
parameter treedepth and for $k=2$. Specifically, we show that an FPT algorithm solving $2$-Digraph
Coloring with dependence $td^{o(td)}$ would contradict the ETH.

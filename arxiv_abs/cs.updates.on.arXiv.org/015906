The automatic assignment of a severity score to the CT scans of patients affected by COVID-19 pneumonia
could reduce the workload in radiology departments. This study aims at exploiting Artificial intelligence
(AI) for the identification, segmentation and quantification of COVID-19 pulmonary lesions.
We investigated the effects of using multiple datasets, heterogeneously populated and annotated
according to different criteria. We developed an automated analysis pipeline, the LungQuant system,
based on a cascade of two U-nets. The first one (U-net_1) is devoted to the identification of the lung
parenchyma, the second one (U-net_2) acts on a bounding box enclosing the segmented lungs to identify
the areas affected by COVID-19 lesions. Different public datasets were used to train the U-nets
and to evaluate their segmentation performances, which have been quantified in terms of the Dice
index. The accuracy in predicting the CT-Severity Score (CT-SS) of the LungQuant system has been
also evaluated. Both Dice and accuracy showed a dependency on the quality of annotations of the available
data samples. On an independent and publicly available benchmark dataset, the Dice values measured
between the masks predicted by LungQuant system and the reference ones were 0.95$\pm$0.01 and 0.66$\pm$0.13
for the segmentation of lungs and COVID-19 lesions, respectively. The accuracy of 90% in the identification
of the CT-SS on this benchmark dataset was achieved. We analysed the impact of using data samples
with different annotation criteria in training an AI-based quantification system for pulmonary
involvement in COVID-19 pneumonia. In terms of the Dice index, the U-net segmentation quality strongly
depends on the quality of the lesion annotations. Nevertheless, the CT-SS can be accurately predicted
on independent validation sets, demonstrating the satisfactory generalization ability of the
LungQuant.

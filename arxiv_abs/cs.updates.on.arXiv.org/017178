The 100 MW cryogenic liquid oxygen/hydrogen multi-injector combustor BKD operated by the DLR Institute
of Space Propulsion is a research platform that allows the study of thermoacoustic instabilities
under realistic conditions, representative of small upper stage rocket engines. We use data from
BKD experimental campaigns in which the static chamber pressure and fuel-oxidizer ratio are varied
such that the first tangential mode of the combustor is excited under some conditions. We train an
autoregressive Bayesian neural network model to forecast the amplitude of the dynamic pressure
time series, inputting multiple sensor measurements (injector pressure/ temperature measurements,
static chamber pressure, high-frequency dynamic pressure measurements, high-frequency OH*
chemiluminescence measurements) and future flow rate control signals. The Bayesian nature of
our algorithms allows us to work with a dataset whose size is restricted by the expense of each experimental
run, without making overconfident extrapolations. We find that the networks are able to accurately
forecast the evolution of the pressure amplitude and anticipate instability events on unseen experimental
runs 500 milliseconds in advance. We compare the predictive accuracy of multiple models using different
combinations of sensor inputs. We find that the high-frequency dynamic pressure signal is particularly
informative. We also use the technique of integrated gradients to interpret the influence of different
sensor inputs on the model prediction. The negative log-likelihood of data points in the test dataset
indicates that predictive uncertainties are well-characterized by our Bayesian model and simulating
a sensor failure event results as expected in a dramatic increase in the epistemic component of the
uncertainty.

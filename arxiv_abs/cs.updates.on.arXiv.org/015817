Cryptocurrencies are increasingly popular. Even people who are not experts have started to invest
in these securities, and nowadays, cryptocurrency exchanges process transactions for over 100
billion US dollars per month. In spite of this, many cryptocurrencies have low liquidity, and therefore,
they are highly prone to market manipulation. This paper performs an in-depth analysis of two market
manipulations organized by communities over the Internet: The pump and dump and the crowd pump.
The pump and dump scheme is a fraud as old as the stock market. Now, it got new vitality in the loosely
regulated market of cryptocurrencies. Groups of highly coordinated people arrange this scam,
usually on Telegram and Discord. We monitored these groups for more than 3 years detecting around
900 individual events. We analyze how these communities are organized and how they carry out the
fraud. We report on three case studies of pump and dump. Then, we leverage our unique dataset of the
verified pump and dumps to build a machine learning model able to detect a pump and dump in 25 seconds
from the moment it starts, achieving the results of 94.5% of F1-score. Then, we move on to the crowd
pump, a new phenomenon that hit the news in the first months of 2021, when a Reddit community inflates
the price of the GameStop stocks (GME) of over 1,900% on Wall Street, the world's largest stock exchange.
Later, other Reddit communities replicate the operation on the cryptocurrency markets. The targets
were Dogecoin (DOGE) and Ripple (XRP). We reconstruct how these operations developed, and we discuss
differences and analogies with the standard pump and dump. Lastly, we illustrate how it is possible
to leverage our classifier to detect this kind of operation too.

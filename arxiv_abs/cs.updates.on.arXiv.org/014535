As genome sequencing tools and techniques improve, researchers are able to incrementally assemble
more accurate reference genomes, which enable sensitivity in read mapping and downstream analysis
such as variant calling. A more sensitive downstream analysis is critical for a better understanding
of the genome donor (e.g., health characteristics). Therefore, read sets from sequenced samples
should ideally be mapped to the latest available reference genome that represents the most relevant
population. Unfortunately, the increasingly large amount of available genomic data makes it prohibitively
expensive to fully re-map each read set to its respective reference genome every time the reference
is updated. There are several tools that attempt to accelerate the process of updating a read data
set from one reference to another (i.e., remapping). However, if a read maps to a region in the old
reference that does not appear with a reasonable degree of similarity in the new reference, the read
cannot be remapped. We find that, as a result of this drawback, a significant portion of annotations
are lost when using state-of-the-art remapping tools. To address this major limitation in existing
tools, we propose AirLift, a fast and comprehensive technique for remapping alignments from one
genome to another. Compared to the state-of-the-art method for remapping reads (i.e., full mapping),
AirLift reduces 1) the number of reads that need to be fully mapped to the new reference by up to 99.99\%
and 2) the overall execution time to remap read sets between two reference genome versions by 6.7x,
6.6x, and 2.8x for large (human), medium (C. elegans), and small (yeast) reference genomes, respectively.
We validate our remapping results with GATK and find that AirLift provides similar accuracy in identifying
ground truth SNP and INDEL variants as the baseline of fully mapping a read set.

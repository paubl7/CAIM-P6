Machine learning (ML) offers a collection of powerful approaches for detecting and modeling associations,
often applied to data having a large number of features and/or complex associations. Currently,
there are many tools to facilitate implementing custom ML analyses (e.g. scikit-learn). Interest
is also increasing in automated ML packages, which can make it easier for non-experts to apply ML
and have the potential to improve model performance. ML permeates most subfields of biomedical
research with varying levels of rigor and correct usage. Tremendous opportunities offered by ML
are frequently offset by the challenge of assembling comprehensive analysis pipelines, and the
ease of ML misuse. In this work we have laid out and assembled a complete, rigorous ML analysis pipeline
focused on binary classification (i.e. case/control prediction), and applied this pipeline to
both simulated and real world data. At a high level, this 'automated' but customizable pipeline
includes a) exploratory analysis, b) data cleaning and transformation, c) feature selection,
d) model training with 9 established ML algorithms, each with hyperparameter optimization, and
e) thorough evaluation, including appropriate metrics, statistical analyses, and novel visualizations.
This pipeline organizes the many subtle complexities of ML pipeline assembly to illustrate best
practices to avoid bias and ensure reproducibility. Additionally, this pipeline is the first to
compare established ML algorithms to 'ExSTraCS', a rule-based ML algorithm with the unique capability
of interpretably modeling heterogeneous patterns of association. While designed to be widely
applicable we apply this pipeline to an epidemiological investigation of established and newly
identified risk factors for pancreatic cancer to evaluate how different sources of bias might be
handled by ML algorithms.

Previous studies demonstrate that grain-boundary sliding could accelerate creep rate and give
rise to large internal stresses that can lead to damage development, e.g. formation of wedge cracks.
The present study provides more insight into the effects of grain-boundary sliding (GBS) on the
deformation behaviour of realistic polycrystalline aggregates during creep, through the development
of a computational framework which combines: i) the use of interface elements for sliding at grain
boundaries, and ii) special triple point (in 2D) or triple line (in 3D) elements to prevent artificial
dilation at these locations in the microstructure with iii) a physically-based crystal plasticity
constitutive model for time-dependent inelastic deformation of the individual grains. Experimental
data at various scales is used to calibrate the framework and compare with model predictions. We
pay particular consideration to effects of grain boundary sliding during creep of Type 316 stainless
steel, which is used extensively in structural components of the UK fleet of Advanced Gas Cooled
Nuclear Reactors (AGRs). It is found that the anisotropic deformation of the grains and the mismatch
in crystallographic orientation between neighbouring grains play a significant role in determining
the extent of sliding on a given boundary. Their effect on the development of stress within the grains,
particularly at triple grain junctions, and the increase in axial stress along transverse boundaries
are quantified. The article demonstrates that the magnitude of the stress along the facets is highly-dependent
on the crystallographic orientations of the neighbouring grains and the relative amount of sliding.
Boundaries, transverse to the applied load tend to carry higher normal stresses of the order of 100-180
MPa, in cases where the neighbouring grains consist of plastically-harder crystallographic orientations.

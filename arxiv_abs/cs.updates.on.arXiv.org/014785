Open source software has drawn more and more attention from researchers, developers and companies
nowadays. Meanwhile, many Chinese technology companies are embracing open source and choosing
to open source their projects. Nevertheless, most previous studies are concentrated on international
companies such as Microsoft or Google, while the practical values of open source projects of Chinese
technology companies remain unclear. To address this issue, we conduct a mixed-method study to
investigate the landscape of projects open sourced by three large Chinese technology companies,
namely Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent (BAT). We study the categories and characteristics of open source
projects, the developer's perceptions towards open sourcing effort for these companies, and the
internationalization effort of their open source projects. We collected 1,000 open source projects
that were open sourced by BAT in GitHub and performed an online survey that received 101 responses
from developers of these projects. Some key findings include: 1) BAT prefer to open source frontend
development projects, 2) 88\% of the respondents are positive towards open sourcing software projects
in their respective companies, 3) 64\% of the respondents reveal that the most common motivations
for BAT to open source their projects are the desire to gain fame, expand their influence and gain
recruitment advantage, 4) respondents believe that the most common internationalization effort
is "providing an English version of readme files", 5) projects with more internationalization
effort (i.e., include an English readme file) are more popular. Our findings provide directions
for software engineering researchers and provide practical suggestions to software developers
and Chinese technology companies.

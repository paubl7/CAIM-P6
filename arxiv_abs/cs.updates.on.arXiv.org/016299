Social media is becoming a primary medium to discuss what is happening around the world. Therefore,
the data generated by social media platforms contain rich information which describes the ongoing
events. Further, the timeliness associated with these data is capable of facilitating immediate
insights. However, considering the dynamic nature and high volume of data production in social
media data streams, it is impractical to filter the events manually and therefore, automated event
detection mechanisms are invaluable to the community. Apart from a few notable exceptions, most
previous research on automated event detection have focused only on statistical and syntactical
features in data and lacked the involvement of underlying semantics which are important for effective
information retrieval from text since they represent the connections between words and their meanings.
In this paper, we propose a novel method termed Embed2Detect for event detection in social media
by combining the characteristics in word embeddings and hierarchical agglomerative clustering.
The adoption of word embeddings gives Embed2Detect the capability to incorporate powerful semantical
features into event detection and overcome a major limitation inherent in previous approaches.
We experimented our method on two recent real social media data sets which represent the sports and
political domain and also compared the results to several state-of-the-art methods. The obtained
results show that Embed2Detect is capable of effective and efficient event detection and it outperforms
the recent event detection methods. For the sports data set, Embed2Detect achieved 27% higher F-measure
than the best-performed baseline and for the political data set, it was an increase of 29%.

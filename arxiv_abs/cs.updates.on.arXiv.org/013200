Visible Light Communication (VLC) is a rapidly growing technology which can supplement the current
radio frequency (RF) based wireless communication systems. VLC can play a huge part in solving the
ever-increasing problem of spectrum scarcity because of the growing availability of Light Emitting
Diodes (LEDs). One of the biggest advantages of VLC over other communication systems is that it can
provide illumination and data communication simultaneously without needing any extra deployment.
Although it is essential to provide data rate at a blazing speed to all the users nowadays, maintaining
a satisfactory level in the distribution of lighting is also important. In this paper, we present
a novel approach of using mirrors to enhance the illumination uniformity and throughput of an indoor
multi-element VLC system architecture. In this approach, we improve the Signal-to-Interference
plus Noise Ratio (SINR) of the system and overall illumination uniformity of the room by redirecting
the reflected LED beams on the walls to darker spots with the use of mirrors. We formulate a joint optimization
problem focusing on maximization of the SINR while maintaining a reasonable illumination uniformity
across the room. We propose a two-stage solution of the optimization problem with optimization
of illumination in the first stage and SINR at the second stage. We propose three different heuristic
solutions for the second stage and analyze the performance of them, which demonstrates the advantages
of each heuristic for different possible scenarios. We also show that about threefold increase
in average illumination and fourfold increase in average throughput can be achieved when the mirror
placement is applied which is a significant performance improvement.

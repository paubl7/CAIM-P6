Edge/Fog computing is a novel computing paradigm that provides resource-limited Internet of Things
(IoT) devices with scalable computing and storage resources. Compared to cloud computing, edge/fog
servers have fewer resources, but they can be accessed with higher bandwidth and less communication
latency. Thus, integrating edge/fog and cloud infrastructures can support the execution of diverse
latency-sensitive and computation-intensive IoT applications. Although some frameworks attempt
to provide such integration, there are still several challenges to be addressed, such as dynamic
scheduling of different IoT applications, scalability mechanisms, multi-platform support,
and supporting different interaction models. To overcome these challenges, we propose a lightweight
and distributed container-based framework, called FogBus2. It provides a mechanism for scheduling
heterogeneous IoT applications and implements several scheduling policies. Also, it proposes
an optimized genetic algorithm to obtain fast convergence to well-suited solutions. Besides,
it offers a scalability mechanism to ensure efficient responsiveness when either the number of
IoT devices increases or the resources become overburdened. Also, the dynamic resource discovery
mechanism of FogBus2 assists new entities to quickly join the system. We have also developed two
IoT applications, called Conway's Game of Life and Video Optical Character Recognition to demonstrate
the effectiveness of FogBus2 for handling real-time and non-real-time IoT applications. Experimental
results show FogBus2's scheduling policy improves the response time of IoT applications by 53\%
compared to other policies. Also, the scalability mechanism can reduce up to 48\% of the queuing
waiting time compared to frameworks that do not support scalability.

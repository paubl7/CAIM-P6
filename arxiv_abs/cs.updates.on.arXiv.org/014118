Tomographic image reconstruction with deep learning (DL) is an emerging field of applied artificial
intelligence, but a recent important study published in PNAS reveals that several deep reconstruction
networks are unstable for computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Specifically,
three kinds of instabilities were identified: (1) strong output artefacts from tiny perturbation,
(2) small features being undetectable, and (3) increased input data leading to decreased performance.
Since deep reconstruction is a mainstream approach to achieve better tomographic image quality,
stabilizing deep networks is an urgent challenge. Here we propose an Analytic Compressive Iterative
Deep (ACID) network to fundamentally address this challenge. Instead of only using DL or compressed
sensing, ACID consists of four modules including deep learning, compressed sensing-based sparsity
promotion, analytic mapping, and iterative refinement. We show the convergence and stability
of ACID under mild conditions and improve deep reconstruction by stabilizing an unstable deep reconstruction
network in the ACID framework and demonstrate the stability of the whole ACID model against adversarial
attacks. In our experiments, ACID eliminated all three kinds of instabilities and significantly
improved image quality in the context of the aforementioned study, demonstrating that data-driven
reconstruction can be stabilized to outperform reconstruction using compressed sensing alone.
The power of ACID comes from a combination of a deep reconstruction network trained on big data, compressed
sensing with kernel awareness, and iterative refinement to eliminate any unexplained data residual.
We anticipate that this integrative closed-loop data-driven approach opens new opportunities
to advance clinical and other applications.

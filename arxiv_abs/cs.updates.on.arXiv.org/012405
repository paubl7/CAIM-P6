YouTube is an important source of news and entertainment worldwide, but the scale makes it challenging
to study the ideas and topics being discussed on the platform. This paper presents new methods to
discover and classify YouTube channels which enable the analysis of communities and categories
on the platform using orders of magnitude more channels than have been used in previous studies.
Instead of using channel and video data as features for classification as other researchers have,
these methods use a self-supervised learning approach that leverages the public subscription
pages of commenters. We test the classification method on the task of predicting the political lean
of YouTube news channels and find that it outperforms the previous best model on the task. Further
experiments also show that there are important advantages to using commenter subscriptions to
discover channels. The subscription data, along with an iterative approach, is applied to discover,
to our current understanding, the most comprehensive set of English language socio-political
YouTube channels yet to be analyzed. We experiment with predicting more fine grained political
tags for channels using a previously annotated dataset and find that our model performs better than
the average individual human reviewer for most of the top tags. This fine grained political tag model
is then applied to the newly discovered English language socio-political channels to create a new
dataset to analyze the amount of traffic going to different political content. The data shows that
some tags, such as "Partisan Right" and "Conspiracy", are significantly under represented when
looking only at the most popular socio-political channels. Through the use of our methods, we are
able to get a much more accurate picture of the size of these communities on YouTube.

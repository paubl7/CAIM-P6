We consider the leakage resilience of AG code-based ramp secret sharing schemes extending the leakage
resilience of linear threshold secret sharing schemes over prime fields done by Benhamouda et al.
Since there is not any explicit efficient construction of AG codes over prime fields, we consider
constructions over prime fields with the help of concatenation method and those over field extensions.
Extending the Fourier analysis done by Benhamouda et al., concatenated algebraic geometric codes
over prime fields do produce some nice leakage-resilient secret sharing schemes. One natural and
curious question is whether AG codes over extension fields produce better leakage-resilient secret
sharing schemes than the construction based on concatenated AG codes. Such construction provides
several advantages compared to the construction over prime fields using concatenation method.
First, AG codes over extension fields give secret sharing schemes with smaller reconstruction
for a fixed privacy parameter t. Second, concatenated AG codes do not enjoy strong multiplicity
and hence they are not applicable to secure MPC schemes. It is also confirmed that indeed AG codes
over extension fields have stronger leakage-resilience under some reasonable assumptions. These
three advantages strongly motivate the study of secret sharing schemes from AG codes over extension
fields. The current paper has two main contributions: 1, we obtain leakage-resilient secret sharing
schemes with constant share sizes and unbounded numbers of players. Like Shamir secret scheme,
our schemes enjoy multiplicity and hence can be applied to MPC. 2, via a sophisticated Fourier Analysis,
we analyze the leakage-resilience of secret sharing schemes from codes over extension fields.
This is of its own theoretical interest independent of its application to secret sharing schemes
from algebraic geometric codes over extension fields.

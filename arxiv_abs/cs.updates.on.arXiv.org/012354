It is evident that the infection with this severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
starts with the upper respiratory tract and as the virus grows, the infection can progress to lungs
and develop pneumonia. According to the statistics, approximately 14\% of the infected people
with COVID-19 have severe cough and shortness of breath due to pneumonia, because as the viral infection
increases, it damages the alveoli (small air sacs) and surrounding tissues. The conventional way
of COVID-19 diagnosis is reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which is less
sensitive during early stages specially, if the patient is asymptomatic that may further lead to
more severe pneumonia. To overcome this problem an early diagnosis method is proposed in this paper
via one-class classification approach using a novel pinball loss function based one-class support
vector machine (PB-OCSVM) considering posteroanterior chest X-ray images. Recently, several
automated COVID-19 diagnosis models have been proposed based on various deep learning architectures
to identify pulmonary infections using publicly available chest X-ray (CXR) where the presence
of less number of COVID-19 positive samples compared to other classes (normal, pneumonia and Tuberculosis)
raises the challenge for unbiased learning in deep learning models that has been solved using class
balancing techniques which however should be avoided in any medical diagnosis process. Inspired
by this phenomenon, this article proposes a novel PB-OCSVM model to work in presence of limited COVID-19
positive CXR samples with objectives to maximize the learning efficiency while minimize the false-positive
and false-negative predictions. The proposed model outperformed over recently published deep
learning approaches where accuracy, precision, specificity and sensitivity are used as performance
measure parameters.

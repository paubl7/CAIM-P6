In the mobile Internet era, recommender systems have become an irreplaceable tool to help users
discover useful items, thus alleviating the information overload problem. Recent research on
deep neural network (DNN)-based recommender systems have made significant progress in improving
prediction accuracy, largely attributed to the widely accessible large-scale user data. Such
data is commonly collected from users' personal devices, and then centrally stored in the cloud
server to facilitate model training. However, with the rising public concerns on user privacy leakage
in online platforms, online users are becoming increasingly anxious over abuses of user privacy.
Therefore, it is urgent and beneficial to develop a recommender system that can achieve both high
prediction accuracy and strong privacy protection. To this end, we propose a DNN-based recommendation
model called PrivRec running on the decentralized federated learning (FL) environment, which
ensures that a user's data is fully retained on her/his personal device while contributing to training
an accurate model. On the other hand, to better embrace the data heterogeneity (e.g., users' data
vary in scale and quality significantly) in FL, we innovatively introduce a first-order meta-learning
method that enables fast on-device personalization with only a few data points. Furthermore, to
defend against potential malicious participants that pose serious security threat to other users,
we further develop a user-level differentially private model, namely DP-PrivRec, so attackers
are unable to identify any arbitrary user from the trained model. Finally, we conduct extensive
experiments on two large-scale datasets in a simulated FL environment, and the results validate
the superiority of both PrivRec and DP-PrivRec.

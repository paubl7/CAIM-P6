We introduce a simple yet effective distillation framework that is able to boost the vanilla ResNet-50
to 80%+ Top-1 accuracy on ImageNet without tricks. We construct such a framework through analyzing
the problems in the existing classification system and simplify the base method ensemble knowledge
distillation via discriminators by: (1) adopting the similarity loss and discriminator only on
the final outputs and (2) using the average of softmax probabilities from all teacher ensembles
as the stronger supervision. Intriguingly, three novel perspectives are presented for distillation:
(1) weight decay can be weakened or even completely removed since the soft label also has a regularization
effect; (2) using a good initialization for students is critical; and (3) one-hot/hard label is
not necessary in the distillation process if the weights are well initialized. We show that such
a straight-forward framework can achieve state-of-the-art results without involving any commonly-used
techniques, such as architecture modification; outside training data beyond ImageNet; autoaug/randaug;
cosine learning rate; mixup/cutmix training; label smoothing; etc. Our method obtains 80.67%
top-1 accuracy on ImageNet using a single crop-size of 224x224 with vanilla ResNet-50, outperforming
the previous state-of-the-arts by a significant margin under the same network structure. Our result
can be regarded as a strong baseline using knowledge distillation, and to our best knowledge, this
is also the first method that is able to boost vanilla ResNet-50 to surpass 80% on ImageNet without
architecture modification or additional training data. On smaller ResNet-18, our distillation
framework consistently improves from 69.76% to 73.19%, which shows tremendous practical values
in real-world applications. Our code and models are available at: https://github.com/szq0214/MEAL-V2.

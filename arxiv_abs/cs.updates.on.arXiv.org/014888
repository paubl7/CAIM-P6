We show that the matroid secretary problem is equivalent to correlated contention resolution in
the online random-order model. Specifically, the matroid secretary conjecture is true if and only
if every matroid admits an online random-order contention resolution scheme which, given an arbitrary
(possibly correlated) prior distribution over subsets of the ground set, matches the balance ratio
of the best offline scheme for that distribution up to a constant. We refer to such a scheme as universal.
Our result indicates that the core challenge of the matroid secretary problem lies in resolving
contention for positively correlated inputs, in particular when the positive correlation is benign
in as much as offline contention resolution is concerned. Our result builds on our previous work
which establishes one direction of this equivalence, namely that the secretary conjecture implies
universal random-order contention resolution, as well as a weak converse, which derives a matroid
secretary algorithm from a random-order contention resolution scheme with only partial knowledge
of the distribution. It is this weak converse that we strengthen in this paper: We show that universal
random-order contention resolution for matroids, in the usual setting of a fully known prior distribution,
suffices to resolve the matroid secretary conjecture in the affirmative. Our proof is the composition
of three reductions. First, we use duality arguments to reduce the matroid secretary problem to
the matroid prophet secretary problem with arbitrarily correlated distributions. Second, we
introduce a generalization of contention resolution we term labeled contention resolution, to
which we reduce the correlated matroid prophet secretary problem. Finally, we combine duplication
of elements with limiting arguments to reduce labeled contention resolution to classical contention
resolution.

It is always a challenging problem to deliver a huge volume of videos over the Internet. To meet the
high bandwidth and stringent playback demand, one feasible solution is to cache video contents
on edge servers based on predicted video popularity. Traditional caching algorithms (e.g., LRU,
LFU) are too simple to capture the dynamics of video popularity, especially long-tailed videos.
Recent learning-driven caching algorithms (e.g., DeepCache) show promising performance, however,
such black-box approaches are lack of explainability and interpretability. Moreover, the parameter
tuning requires a large number of historical records, which are difficult to obtain for videos with
low popularity. In this paper, we optimize video caching at the edge using a white-box approach,
which is highly efficient and also completely explainable. To accurately capture the evolution
of video popularity, we develop a mathematical model called \emph{HRS} model, which is the combination
of multiple point processes, including Hawkes' self-exciting, reactive and self-correcting
processes. The key advantage of the HRS model is its explainability, and much less number of model
parameters. In addition, all its model parameters can be learned automatically through maximizing
the Log-likelihood function constructed by past video request events. Next, we further design
an online HRS-based video caching algorithm. To verify its effectiveness, we conduct a series of
experiments using real video traces collected from Tencent Video, one of the largest online video
providers in China. Experiment results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm outperforms the
state-of-the-art algorithms, with 12.3\% improvement on average in terms of cache hit rate under
realistic settings.

We present a faster symbolic algorithm for the following central problem in probabilistic verification:
Compute the maximal end-component (MEC) decomposition of Markov decision processes (MDPs). This
problem generalizes the SCC decomposition problem of graphs and closed recurrent sets of Markov
chains. The model of symbolic algorithms is widely used in formal verification and model-checking,
where access to the input model is restricted to only symbolic operations (e.g., basic set operations
and computation of one-step neighborhood). For an input MDP with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the
classical symbolic algorithm from the 1990s for the MEC decomposition requires $O(n^2)$ symbolic
operations and $O(1)$ symbolic space. The only other symbolic algorithm for the MEC decomposition
requires $O(n \sqrt{m})$ symbolic operations and $O(\sqrt{m})$ symbolic space. A main open question
is whether the worst-case $O(n^2)$ bound for symbolic operations can be beaten. We present a symbolic
algorithm that requires $\widetilde{O}(n^{1.5})$ symbolic operations and $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{n})$
symbolic space. Moreover, the parametrization of our algorithm provides a trade-off between symbolic
operations and symbolic space: for all $0<\epsilon \leq 1/2$ the symbolic algorithm requires $\widetilde{O}(n^{2-\epsilon})$
symbolic operations and $\widetilde{O}(n^{\epsilon})$ symbolic space ($\widetilde{O}$ hides
poly-logarithmic factors). Using our techniques we present faster algorithms for computing the
almost-sure winning regions of $\omega$-regular objectives for MDPs. We consider the canonical
parity objectives for $\omega$-regular objectives, and for parity objectives with $d$-priorities
we present an algorithm that computes the almost-sure winning region with $\widetilde{O}(n^{2-\epsilon})$
symbolic operations and $\widetilde{O}(n^{\epsilon})$ symbolic space, for all $0 < \epsilon
\leq 1/2$.

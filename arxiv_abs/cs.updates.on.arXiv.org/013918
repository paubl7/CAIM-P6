In this paper, we take a critical and fresh look at the downlink multi-antenna NOMA literature. Instead
of contrasting NOMA with OMA, we contrast NOMA with two other baselines. The first is conventional
Multi-User Linear Precoding (MULP). The second is Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) based
on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) and SIC. We show that there is some confusion about the benefits
of NOMA, and we dispel the associated misconceptions. First, we highlight why NOMA is inefficient
in multi-antenna settings based on basic multiplexing gain analysis. We stress that the issue lies
in how the NOMA literature has been hastily applied to multi-antenna setups, resulting in a misuse
of spatial dimensions and therefore loss in multiplexing gains and rate. Second, we show that NOMA
incurs a severe multiplexing gain loss despite an increased receiver complexity due to an inefficient
use of SIC receivers. Third, we emphasize that much of the merits of NOMA are due to the constant comparison
to OMA instead of comparing it to MULP and RS baselines. We then expose the pivotal design constraint
that multi-antenna NOMA requires one user to fully decode the messages of the other users. This design
constraint is responsible for the multiplexing gain erosion, rate loss, and inefficient use of
SIC receivers in multi-antenna settings. Our results confirm that NOMA should not be applied blindly
to multi-antenna settings, highlight the scenarios where MULP outperforms NOMA and vice versa,
and demonstrate the inefficiency, performance loss and complexity disadvantages of NOMA compared
to RS. The first takeaway message is that, while NOMA is not beneficial in most multi-antenna deployments.
The second takeaway message is that other non-orthogonal transmission frameworks, such as RS,
exist which fully exploit the multiplexing gain and the benefits of SIC to boost the rate in multi-antenna
settings.

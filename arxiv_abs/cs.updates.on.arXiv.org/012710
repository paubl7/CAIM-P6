Software-Defined Metamaterials (SDMs) show a strong potential for advancing the engineered control
of electromagnetic waves. As such, they are envisioned to enable a variety of exciting applications,
among others in the domains of smart textiles, high-resolution structural monitoring, and sensing
in challenging environments. Many of the applications envisage deformations of the SDM structure,
such as its bending, stretching or rolling, which implies that the locations of metamaterial elements
will be changing relative to one another. In this paper, we argue that, if this change of relative
locations would be quantifiable, i.e., if the metamaterial elements would be accurately localizable,
this location information could potentially be utilized for enabling novel SDM applications,
as well as for optimizing the control of the metamaterial elements themselves. The question if it
is possible, as well as how to perform such localization is, however, yet to spark in the community.
In this work, we assume that the metamaterial elements are controlled wirelessly through a Terahertz
(THz)-operating nanonetwork. Moreover, we consider the elements to be energy-constrained, with
their sole powering option being to harvest environmental energy. For such a setup, we demonstrate
sub-millimeter accuracy of the two-way Time of Flight (ToF)-based localization, as well as high
availability of the service (i.e., consistently more than 80% of the time), which is a result of the
low energy consumed in the localization. We do that for an exhaustive set of system parameters, among
other the operational frequency, bandwidth, harvesting rate, as well as their energy harvesting
and consumption patterns. Finally, we qualitatively characterize the effects of the mentioned
system parameters on the latency of the proposed localization service, as well as outline several
challenges and future research directions.

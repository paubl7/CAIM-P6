The connectivity and resource-constrained nature of IoT, and in particular single-board devices,
opens up to cybersecurity concerns affecting the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). One of the
most important is the presence of evil IoT twins. Evil IoT twins are malicious devices, with identical
hardware and software configurations to authorized ones, that can provoke sensitive information
leakages, data poisoning, or privilege escalation in industrial scenarios. Combining behavioral
fingerprinting and Machine/Deep Learning (ML/DL) techniques is a promising solution to identify
evil IoT twins by detecting minor performance differences generated by imperfections in manufacturing.
However, existing solutions are not suitable for single-board devices because they do not consider
their hardware and software limitations, underestimate critical aspects during the identification
performance evaluation, and do not explore the potential of ML/DL techniques. Moreover, there
is a dramatic lack of work explaining essential aspects to considering during the identification
of identical devices. This work proposes an ML/DL-oriented methodology that uses behavioral fingerprinting
to identify identical single-board devices. The methodology leverages the different built-in
components of the system, comparing their internal behavior with each other to detect variations
that occurred in manufacturing processes. The validation has been performed in a real environment
composed of identical Raspberry Pi 4 Model B devices, achieving the identification for all devices
by setting a 50% threshold in the evaluation process. Finally, a discussion compares the proposed
solution with related work and provides important lessons learned and limitations.

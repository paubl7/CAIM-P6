In this paper, we present a framework to design approximation algorithms for capacitated facility
location problems with penalties/outliers using LP-rounding. Primal-dual technique, which
has been particularly successful in dealing with outliers and penalties, has not been very successful
in dealing with capacities. On the other hand, no primal-dual solution has been able to break the
hardness of capacitated facility location problem(CFLP). LP-rounding techniques had also not
been very successful in dealing with capacities until a recent work by Grover et al. \cite{GroverGKP18}.
Their constant factor approximation violating the capacities by a small factor ($1 + \epsilon$)
is promising while dealing with capacities.Though LP-rounding has not been very promising while
dealing with penalties and outliers, we successfully apply it to deal with them along with capacities.
That is, our results are obtained by rounding the solution to the natural LP once again exhibiting
the power of LP-rounding technique. Solutions obtained by LP-rounding are easy to integrate with
other LP-based algorithms.In this paper, we apply our framework to obtain first constant factor
approximations for capacitated facility location problem with outlier (CFLPO) and capacitated
$k$-facility location problem with penalty(C$k$FLPP) for hard uniform capacities using LP-rounding.
Our solutions incur slight violations in capacities, ($1 + \epsilon$) for the problems without
cardinality($k$) constraint and ($2 + \epsilon$) for the problems with the cardinality constraint.
For the outlier variant, we also incur a small loss ($1 + \epsilon$) in outliers. Due to the hardness
of the underlying problems, the violations are inevitable. Thus we achieve the best possible by
rounding the solution of natural LP for these problems. To the best of our knowledge, no results are
known for CFLPO and C$k$FLPP.

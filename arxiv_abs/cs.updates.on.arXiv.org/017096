Image Super Resolution (SR) finds applications in areas where images need to be closely inspected
by the observer to extract enhanced information. One such focused application is an offline forensic
analysis of surveillance feeds. Due to the limitations of camera hardware, camera pose, limited
bandwidth, varying illumination conditions, and occlusions, the quality of the surveillance
feed is significantly degraded at times, thereby compromising monitoring of behavior, activities,
and other sporadic information in the scene. For the proposed research work, we have inspected the
effectiveness of four conventional yet effective SR algorithms and three deep learning-based
SR algorithms to seek the finest method that executes well in a surveillance environment with limited
training data op-tions. These algorithms generate an enhanced resolution output image from a sin-gle
low-resolution (LR) input image. For performance analysis, a subset of 220 images from six surveillance
datasets has been used, consisting of individuals with varying distances from the camera, changing
illumination conditions, and complex backgrounds. The performance of these algorithms has been
evaluated and compared using both qualitative and quantitative metrics. These SR algo-rithms
have also been compared based on face detection accuracy. By analyzing and comparing the performance
of all the algorithms, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based SR technique using an external
dictionary proved to be best by achieving robust face detection accuracy and scoring optimal quantitative
metric results under different surveillance conditions. This is because the CNN layers progressively
learn more complex features using an external dictionary.

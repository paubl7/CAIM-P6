Face aging is to render a given face to predict its future appearance, which plays an important role
in the information forensics and security field as the appearance of the face typically varies with
age. Although impressive results have been achieved with conditional generative adversarial
networks (cGANs), the existing cGANs-based methods typically use a single network to learn various
aging effects between any two different age groups. However, they cannot simultaneously meet three
essential requirements of face aging -- including image quality, aging accuracy, and identity
preservation -- and usually generate aged faces with strong ghost artifacts when the age gap becomes
large. Inspired by the fact that faces gradually age over time, this paper proposes a novel progressive
face aging framework based on generative adversarial network (PFA-GAN) to mitigate these issues.
Unlike the existing cGANs-based methods, the proposed framework contains several sub-networks
to mimic the face aging process from young to old, each of which only learns some specific aging effects
between two adjacent age groups. The proposed framework can be trained in an end-to-end manner to
eliminate accumulative artifacts and blurriness. Moreover, this paper introduces an age estimation
loss to take into account the age distribution for an improved aging accuracy, and proposes to use
the Pearson correlation coefficient as an evaluation metric measuring the aging smoothness for
face aging methods. Extensively experimental results demonstrate superior performance over
existing (c)GANs-based methods, including the state-of-the-art one, on two benchmarked datasets.

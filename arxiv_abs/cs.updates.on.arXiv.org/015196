Linear impulsively controlled systems are suitable to describe a venue of real-life problems,
going from disease treatment to aerospace guidance. The main characteristic of such systems is
that they remain uncontrolled for certain periods of time. As a consequence, punctual equilibria
characterizations outside the origin are no longer useful, and the whole concept of equilibrium
and its natural extension, the controlled invariant sets, needs to be redefined. Also, an exact
characterization of the admissible states, i.e., states such that their uncontrolled evolution
between impulse times remain within a predefined set, is required. An approach to such tasks -- based
on the Markov-Lukasz theorem -- is presented, providing a tractable and non-conservative characterization,
emerging from polynomial positivity that has application to systems with rational eigenvalues.
This is in turn the basis for obtaining a tractable approximation to the maximal admissible invariant
sets. In this work, it is also demonstrated that, in order for the problem to have a solution, an invariant
set (and moreover, an equilibrium set) must be contained within the target zone. To assess the proposal,
the so-obtained impulsive invariant set is explicitly used in the formulation of a set-based model
predictive controller, with application to zone tracking. In this context, specific MPC theory
needs to be considered, as the target is not necessarily stable in the sense of Lyapunov. A zone MPC
formulation is proposed, which is able to i) track an invariant set such that the uncontrolled propagation
fulfills the zone constraint at all times and ii) converge asymptotically to the set of periodic
orbits completely contained within the target zone.

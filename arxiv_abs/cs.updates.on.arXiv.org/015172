While innovations in scientific instrumentation have pushed the boundaries of Mars rover mission
capabilities, the increase in data complexity has pressured Mars Science Laboratory (MSL) and
future Mars rover operations staff to quickly analyze complex data sets to meet progressively shorter
tactical and strategic planning timelines. MSLWEB is an internal data tracking tool used by operations
staff to perform first pass analysis on MSL image sequences, a series of products taken by the Mast
camera, Mastcam. Mastcam's multiband multispectral image sequences require more complex analysis
compared to standard 3-band RGB images. Typically, these are analyzed using traditional methods
to identify unique features within the sequence. Given the short time frame of tactical planning
in which downlinked images might need to be analyzed (within 5-10 hours before the next uplink),
there exists a need to triage analysis time to focus on the most important sequences and parts of a
sequence. We address this need by creating products for MSLWEB that use novelty detection to help
operations staff identify unusual data that might be diagnostic of new or atypical compositions
or mineralogies detected within an imaging scene. This was achieved in two ways: 1) by creating products
for each sequence to identify novel regions in the image, and 2) by assigning multispectral sequences
a sortable novelty score. These new products provide colorized heat maps of inferred novelty that
operations staff can use to rapidly review downlinked data and focus their efforts on analyzing
potentially new kinds of diagnostic multispectral signatures. This approach has the potential
to guide scientists to new discoveries by quickly drawing their attention to often subtle variations
not detectable with simple color composites.

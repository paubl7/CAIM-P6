Background. Forecasting the time of forthcoming pandemic reduces the impact of diseases by taking
precautionary steps such as public health messaging and raising the consciousness of doctors.
With the continuous and rapid increase in the cumulative incidence of COVID-19, statistical and
outbreak prediction models including various machine learning (ML) models are being used by the
research community to track and predict the trend of the epidemic, and also in developing appropriate
strategies to combat and manage its spread. Methods. In this paper, we present a comparative analysis
of various ML approaches including Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbor
and Artificial Neural Network in predicting the COVID-19 outbreak in the epidemiological domain.
We first apply the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) method to identify and model the short
and long-run relationships of the time-series COVID-19 datasets. That is, we determine the lags
between a response variable and its respective explanatory time series variables as independent
variables. Then, the resulting significant variables concerning their lags are used in the regression
model selected by the ARDL for predicting and forecasting the trend of the epidemic. Results. Statistical
measures i.e., Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Absolute Percentage
Error (MAPE) are used for model accuracy. The values of MAPE for the best selected models for confirmed,
recovered and deaths cases are 0.407, 0.094 and 0.124 respectively, which falls under the category
of highly accurate forecasts. In addition, we computed fifteen days ahead forecast for the daily
deaths, recover, and confirm patients and the cases fluctuated across time in all aspects. Besides,
the results reveal the advantages of ML algorithms for supporting decision making of evolving short
term policies.

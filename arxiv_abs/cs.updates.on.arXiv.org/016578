Healthcare blockchains provide an innovative way to store healthcare information, execute healthcare
transactions, and build trust for healthcare data sharing and data integration in a decentralized
open healthcare network environment. Although the healthcare blockchain technology has attracted
broad interests and attention in industry, government and academia, the security and privacy concerns
remain the focus of debate when deploying blockchains for information sharing in the healthcare
sector from business operation to research collaboration. This paper focuses on the security and
privacy requirements for medical data sharing using blockchain, and provides a comprehensive
analysis of the security and privacy risks and requirements, accompanied by technical solution
techniques and strategies. First, we discuss the security and privacy requirements and attributes
required for electronic medical data sharing by deploying the healthcare blockchain. Second,
we categorize existing efforts into three reference blockchain usage scenarios for electronic
medical data sharing, and discuss the technologies for implementing these security and privacy
properties in the three categories of usage scenarios for healthcare blockchain, such as anonymous
signatures, attribute-based encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, verification techniques for
smart contract security. Finally, we discuss other potential blockchain application scenarios
in healthcare sector. We conjecture that this survey will help healthcare professionals, decision
makers, and healthcare service developers to gain technical and intuitive insights into the security
and privacy of healthcare blockchains in terms of concepts, risks, requirements, development
and deployment technologies and systems.

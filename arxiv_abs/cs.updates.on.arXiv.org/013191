Conventional spectrometers are limited by trade-offs set by size, cost, signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR), and spectral resolution. Here, we demonstrate a deep learning-based spectral reconstruction
framework, using a compact and low-cost on-chip sensing scheme that is not constrained by the design
trade-offs inherent to grating-based spectroscopy. The system employs a plasmonic spectral encoder
chip containing 252 different tiles of nanohole arrays fabricated using a scalable and low-cost
imprint lithography method, where each tile has a unique geometry and, thus, a unique optical transmission
spectrum. The illumination spectrum of interest directly impinges upon the plasmonic encoder,
and a CMOS image sensor captures the transmitted light, without any lenses, gratings, or other optical
components in between, making the entire hardware highly compact, light-weight and field-portable.
A trained neural network then reconstructs the unknown spectrum using the transmitted intensity
information from the spectral encoder in a feed-forward and non-iterative manner. Benefiting
from the parallelization of neural networks, the average inference time per spectrum is ~28 microseconds,
which is orders of magnitude faster compared to other computational spectroscopy approaches.
When blindly tested on unseen new spectra (N = 14,648) with varying complexity, our deep-learning
based system identified 96.86% of the spectral peaks with an average peak localization error, bandwidth
error, and height error of 0.19 nm, 0.18 nm, and 7.60%, respectively. This system is also highly tolerant
to fabrication defects that may arise during the imprint lithography process, which further makes
it ideal for applications that demand cost-effective, field-portable and sensitive high-resolution
spectroscopy tools.

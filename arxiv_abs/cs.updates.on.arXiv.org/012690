Traditionally, power system's inertia has been estimated according to the rotating masses directly
connected to the grid. However, a new generation mix scenario is currently identified, where conventional
supply-side is gradually replaced by renewable sources decoupled from the grid by electronic converters
(i.e., wind and photovoltaic power plants). Due to the significant penetration of such renewable
generation units, the conventional grid inertia is decreasing, subsequently affecting both reliability
analysis and grid stability. As a result, concepts such as 'synthetic inertia', 'hidden inertia'
or 'virtual inertia', together with alternative spinning reserves, are currently under discussion
to ensure power system stability and reliability. Under this new framework, an algorithm to estimate
the minimum inertia needed to fulfil the ENTSO-E requirements for ROCOF values is proposed and assessed
under a relevant variety of imbalanced conditions. The additional active power needed to be within
the frequency dynamic range is also estimated and determined. Both inertia and additional active
power can come from different sources, such as storage solutions, renewable sources decoupled
from the grid including some frequency control strategies, interconnections with other grids,
or a combination of them. The power system under consideration includes thermal, hydro-power plants,
and renewable generation units, in line with most current and future European supply-side power
systems. More than 700 generation mix scenarios are identified and simulated, varying the renewable
integration, the power imbalance, and the inertia constant of conventional power plants. In fact,
the solutions studied here provide important information to ease the massive integration of renewable
resources, without reducing the capacity of the grid in terms of stability and response to contingencies.

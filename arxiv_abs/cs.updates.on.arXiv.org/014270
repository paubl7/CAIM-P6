Sepsis is the leading cause of mortality in the ICU, responsible for 6% of all hospitalizations and
35% of all in-hospital deaths in USA. However, there is no universally agreed upon strategy for vasopressor
and fluid administration. It has also been observed that different patients respond differently
to treatment, highlighting the need for individualized treatment. Vasopressors and fluids are
administrated with specific effects to cardiovascular physiology in mind and medical research
has suggested that physiologic, hemodynamically guided, approaches to treatment. Thus we propose
a novel approach, exploiting and unifying complementary strengths of Mathematical Modelling,
Deep Learning, Reinforcement Learning and Uncertainty Quantification, to learn individualized,
safe, and uncertainty aware treatment strategies. We first infer patient-specific, dynamic cardiovascular
states using a novel physiology-driven recurrent neural network trained in an unsupervised manner.
This information, along with a learned low dimensional representation of the patient's lab history
and observable data, is then used to derive value distributions using Batch Distributional Reinforcement
Learning. Moreover in a safety critical domain it is essential to know what our agent does and does
not know, for this we also quantify the model uncertainty associated with each patient state and
action, and propose a general framework for uncertainty aware, interpretable treatment policies.
This framework can be tweaked easily, to reflect a clinician's own confidence of the framework,
and can be easily modified to factor in human expert opinion, whenever it's accessible. Using representative
patients and a validation cohort, we show that our method has learned physiologically interpretable
generalizable policies.

We consider the reconstruction of the shape and the impedance function of an obstacle from measurements
of the scattered field at receivers outside the object. The data is assumed to be generated by plane
waves impinging on the obstacle from multiple directions and at multiple frequencies. This inverse
problem is reformulated as the optimization problem of finding band-limited shape and impedance
functions which minimize the $L^2$ distance between the computed value of the scattered field at
the receivers and the data. The optimization problem is non-linear, non-convex, and ill-posed.
Moreover, the objective function is computationally expensive to evaluate. The recursive linearization
approach (RLA) proposed by Chen has been successful in addressing these issues in the context of
recovering the sound speed of a domain or the shape of a sound-soft obstacle. We present an extension
of the RLA for the recovery of both the shape and impedance functions. The RLA is a continuation method
in frequency where a sequence of single frequency inverse problems is solved. At each higher frequency,
one attempts to recover incrementally higher resolution features using a step assumed to be small
enough to ensure that the initial guess obtained at the preceding frequency lies in the basin of attraction
for Newton's method at the new frequency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the method with several
numerical examples. Surprisingly, we find that one can recover the shape with high accuracy even
when the measurements are from sound-hard or sound-soft objects. While the method is effective
in obtaining high quality reconstructions for complicated geometries and impedance functions,
a number of interesting open questions remain. We present numerical experiments that suggest underlying
mechanisms of success and failure, showing areas where improvements could help lead to robust and
automatic tools.

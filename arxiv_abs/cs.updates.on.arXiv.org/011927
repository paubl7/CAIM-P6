Washing hands properly and frequently is the simplest and most cost-effective interventions to
prevent the spread of infectious diseases. People are often ignorant about proper handwashing
in different situations and do not know if they wash hands properly. Smartwatches are found to be
effective for assessing the quality of handwashing. However, the existing smartwatch based systems
are not comprehensive enough in terms of achieving accuracy as well as reminding people to handwash
and providing feedback to the user about the quality of handwashing. On-device processing is often
required to provide real-time feedback to the user, and so it is important to develop a system that
runs efficiently on low-resource devices like smartwatches. However, none of the existing systems
for handwashing quality assessment are optimized for on-device processing. We present iWash,
a comprehensive system for quality assessment and context-aware reminder for handwashing with
real-time feedback using smartwatches. iWash is a hybrid deep neural network based system that
is optimized for on-device processing to ensure high accuracy with minimal processing time and
battery usage. Additionally, it is a context-aware system that detects when the user is entering
home using a Bluetooth beacon and provides reminders to wash hands. iWash also offers touch-free
interaction between the user and the smartwatch that minimizes the risk of germ transmission. We
collected a real-life dataset and conducted extensive evaluations to demonstrate the performance
of iWash. Compared to the existing handwashing quality assessment systems, we achieve around 12%
higher accuracy for quality assessment, as well as we reduce the processing time and battery usage
by around 37% and 10%, respectively.

A classical question in economics is whether complex, randomized selling protocols can improve
a firm's revenue beyond that of simple, take-it-or-leave-it posted prices. In 1981, Myerson answered
this question with an emphatic "No" for a monopolist selling a single product. By contrast, there
is no crisp answer for multiple products, and a major focus of Bayesian mechanism design has been
understanding the increase in revenue from pricing lotteries over products instead of deterministic
products, under different classes of valuation functions and different families of prior customer
distributions. In this paper, we ask the same question for assortment optimization, where products
have exogenously-fixed prices, and the decision is on a set of substitute products to offer. To formalize
such a question, we introduce a Bayesian mechanism design problem where customers have ordinal
preferences for products with fixed prices, in which assortments correspond to deterministic
mechanisms. Meanwhile, randomized mechanisms correspond to lotteries whose payment is restricted
equal the fixed price of the randomly-allocated product, a significant departure from the lotteries
currently studied in Bayesian mechanism design. We first show that for general ordinal preference
distributions, lotteries under this restriction can still earn higher revenue than any deterministic
assortment. We then derive a natural sufficient condition on the distribution which ensures the
optimality of assortments. Importantly, this sufficient condition captures common distributions
used in the assortment optimization literature, including Multi-Nomial Logit (MNL), Markov Chain
choice models, Tversky's Elimination by Aspects model, and mixtures of any one of these with Independent
Demand Models. The takeaway is that unless a firm has a very sophisticated model for consumer choice,
assortments are optimal.

Context: Interest in software engineering (SE) methodologies and tools has been complemented
in recent years by research efforts oriented towards understanding the human processes involved
in software development. This shift has been imperative given reports of inadequately performing
teams and the consequent growing emphasis on individuals and team relations in contemporary SE
methods. Objective: While software repositories have frequently been studied with a view to explaining
such human processes, research has tended to use primarily quantitative analysis approaches.
There is concern, however, that such approaches can provide only a partial picture of the software
process. Given the way human behavior is nuanced within psychological and social contexts, it has
been asserted that a full understanding may only be achieved through deeper contextual enquiries.
Method: We have followed such an approach and have applied data mining, SNA, psycholinguistic analysis
and directed content analysis (CA) to study the way core developers at IBM Rational Jazz contribute
their social and intellectual capital, and have compared the attitudes, interactions and activities
of these members to those of their less active counterparts. Results: Among our results, we uncovered
that Jazz's core developers worked across multiple roles, and were crucial to their teams' organizational,
intra-personal and inter-personal processes. Additionally, although these individuals were
highly task- and achievement-focused, they were also largely responsible for maintaining positive
team atmosphere, and for providing context awareness in support of their colleagues. Conclusion:
Our results suggest that high-performing distributed agile teams rely on both individual and collective
efforts, as well as organizational environments that promote informal and organic work structures.(Abridged)

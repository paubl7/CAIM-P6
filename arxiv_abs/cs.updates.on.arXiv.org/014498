Domain name encryptions (DoTH and ESNI) have been proposed to improve security and privacy while
browsing the web. Although the security benefit is clear, the positive impact on user privacy is
still questionable. Given that the mapping between domains and their hosting IPs can be easily obtained,
the websites a user visits can still be inferred by a network-level observer based on the destination
IPs of user connections. However, content delivery networks, DNS-based load balancing, co-hosting
of different websites on the same server, and IP churn, all contribute towards making domain-IP
mappings unstable, and prevent straightforward IP-based browsing tracking for the majority of
websites. We show that this instability is not a roadblock for browsing tracking (assuming a universal
DoTH and ESNI deployment), by introducing an IP-based fingerprinting technique that allows a network-level
observer to identify the website a user visits with high accuracy, based solely on the IP address
information obtained from the encrypted traffic. Our technique exploits the complex structure
of most websites, which load resources from several domains besides their own primary domain. We
extract the domains contacted while browsing 220K websites to construct domain-based fingerprints.
Each domain-based fingerprint is then converted to an IP-based fingerprint by periodically performing
DNS lookups. Using the generated fingerprints, we could successfully identify 91% of the websites
when observing solely destination IPs. We also evaluated the fingerprints' robustness over time,
and demonstrate that they are still effective at identifying 70% of the tested websites after two
months. We conclude by discussing strategies for website owners and hosting providers to hinder
IP-based website fingerprinting and maximize the privacy benefits offered by domain name encryption.

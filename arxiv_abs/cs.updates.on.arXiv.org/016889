In modern networked society, smart networks are indispensable to offer intelligent communications
and automated services to end-users and organizations. Machine learning (ML)-based network intrusion
detection system (NIDS) plays a critical role in safeguarding smart networks against novel cyber
threats. However, there are two challenges in the existing designs: 1) achieving an outstanding
performance of threat detection often produces high false positives, leading to alert fatigue
and 2) the interpretability of detection results is low, making a difficulty of understanding cyber
threats and taking prompt actions against them. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose
a cyber defense mechanism, namely DarkHunter, which includes three new components: stream processor,
detection engine and incident analyzer. The stream processor converts raw network packets into
data records, including statistical features, which involve latent patterns of legitimates or
anomalies to be effectively discovered using the detection engine. In this essence, the detection
engine leverages an efficient ensemble neural network (EnsembleNet) to accurately identify anomalous
traffic. Finally, the incident analyzer applies a correlation analysis to filter out the mispredictions
from EnsembleNet, traces each detected threat from its statistical representation back to its
source traffic flow to enhance its intelligibility and prioritizes the threats to be processed
to minimize security risks. Our evaluations, based on the UNSW-NB15 dataset, show that DarkHunter
significantly outperforms some state-of-the-art ML-based NIDSs by accomplishing higher accuracy,
higher detection rate, higher precision, higher F1 score while keeping a lower false alarm rate.

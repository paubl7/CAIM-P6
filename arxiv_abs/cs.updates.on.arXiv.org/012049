The effectiveness of traditional traffic prediction methods is often extremely limited when forecasting
traffic dynamics in early morning. The reason is that traffic can break down drastically during
the early morning commute, and the time and duration of this break-down vary substantially from
day to day. Early morning traffic forecast is crucial to inform morning-commute traffic management,
but they are generally challenging to predict in advance, particularly by midnight. In this paper,
we propose to mine Twitter messages as a probing method to understand the impacts of people's work
and rest patterns in the evening/midnight of the previous day to the next-day morning traffic. The
model is tested on freeway networks in Pittsburgh as experiments. The resulting relationship is
surprisingly simple and powerful. We find that, in general, the earlier people rest as indicated
from Tweets, the more congested roads will be in the next morning. The occurrence of big events in
the evening before, represented by higher or lower tweet sentiment than normal, often implies lower
travel demand in the next morning than normal days. Besides, people's tweeting activities in the
night before and early morning are statistically associated with congestion in morning peak hours.
We make use of such relationships to build a predictive framework which forecasts morning commute
congestion using people's tweeting profiles extracted by 5 am or as late as the midnight prior to
the morning. The Pittsburgh study supports that our framework can precisely predict morning congestion,
particularly for some road segments upstream of roadway bottlenecks with large day-to-day congestion
variation. Our approach considerably outperforms those existing methods without Twitter message
features, and it can learn meaningful representation of demand from tweeting profiles that offer
managerial insights.

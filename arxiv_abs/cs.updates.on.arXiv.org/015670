We present the system that we have developed for the identification and verification of pills using
images that are taken by the VeriMedi device. The VeriMedi device is an Internet of Things device
that takes pictures of a filled pill vial from the bottom of the vial and uses the solution that is presented
in this research to identify the pills in the vials. The solution has two serially connected deep
learning solutions which do segmentation and identification. The segmentation solution creates
the masks for each pill in the vial image by using the Mask R-CNN model, then segments and crops the
pills and blurs the background. After that, the segmented pill images are sent to the identification
solution where a Deep Metric Learning model that is trained with Proxy Anchor Loss (PAL) function
generates embedding vectors for each pill image. The generated embedding vectors are fed into a
one-layer fully connected network that is trained with the exact solution to predict each single
pill image. Then, the aggregation/verification function aggregates the multiple predictions
coming from multiple single pill images and verifies the correctness of the final prediction with
respect to predefined rules. Besides, we enhanced the PAL with a better proxy initialization that
increased the performance of the models and let the model learn the new classes of images continually
without retraining the model with the whole dataset. When the model that is trained with initial
classes is retrained only with new classes, the accuracy of the model increases for both old and new
classes. The identification solution that we have presented in this research can also be reused
for other problem domains which require continual learning and/or Fine-Grained Visual Categorization.

Spiculations are important predictors of lung cancer malignancy, which are spikes on the surface
of the pulmonary nodules. In this study, we proposed an interpretable and parameter-free technique
to quantify the spiculation using area distortion metric obtained by the conformal (angle-preserving)
spherical parameterization. We exploit the insight that for an angle-preserved spherical mapping
of a given nodule, the corresponding negative area distortion precisely characterizes the spiculations
on that nodule. We introduced novel spiculation scores based on the area distortion metric and spiculation
measures. We also semi-automatically segment lung nodule (for reproducibility) as well as vessel
and wall attachment to differentiate the real spiculations from lobulation and attachment. A simple
pathological malignancy prediction model is also introduced. We used the publicly-available
LIDC-IDRI dataset pathologists (strong-label) and radiologists (weak-label) ratings to train
and test radiomics models containing this feature, and then externally validate the models. We
achieved AUC$=$0.80 and 0.76, respectively, with the models trained on the 811 weakly-labeled
LIDC datasets and tested on the 72 strongly-labeled LIDC and 73 LUNGx datasets; the previous best
model for LUNGx had AUC$=$0.68. The number-of-spiculations feature was found to be highly correlated
(Spearman's rank correlation coefficient $\rho = 0.44$) with the radiologists' spiculation score.
We developed a reproducible and interpretable, parameter-free technique for quantifying spiculations
on nodules. The spiculation quantification measures was then applied to the radiomics framework
for pathological malignancy prediction with reproducible semi-automatic segmentation of nodule.
Using our interpretable features (size, attachment, spiculation, lobulation), we were able to
achieve higher performance than previous models.

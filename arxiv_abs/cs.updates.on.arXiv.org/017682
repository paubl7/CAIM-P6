More than 90\% of colorectal cancer is gradually transformed from colorectal polyps. In clinical
practice, precise polyp segmentation provides important information in the early detection of
colorectal cancer. Therefore, automatic polyp segmentation techniques are of great importance
for both patients and doctors. Most existing methods are based on U-shape structure and use element-wise
addition or concatenation to fuse different level features progressively in decoder. However,
both the two operations easily generate plenty of redundant information, which will weaken the
complementarity between different level features, resulting in inaccurate localization and
blurred edges of polyps. To address this challenge, we propose a multi-scale subtraction network
(MSNet) to segment polyp from colonoscopy image. Specifically, we first design a subtraction unit
(SU) to produce the difference features between adjacent levels in encoder. Then, we pyramidally
equip the SUs at different levels with varying receptive fields, thereby obtaining rich multi-scale
difference information. In addition, we build a training-free network "LossNet" to comprehensively
supervise the polyp-aware features from bottom layer to top layer, which drives the MSNet to capture
the detailed and structural cues simultaneously. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets
demonstrate that our MSNet performs favorably against most state-of-the-art methods under different
evaluation metrics. Furthermore, MSNet runs at a real-time speed of $\sim$70fps when processing
a $352 \times 352$ image. The source code will be publicly available at \url{https://github.com/Xiaoqi-Zhao-DLUT/MSNet}.

In upcoming years, the number of Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices is expected to surge up to tens
of billions of physical objects. However, while the IoT is often presented as a promising solution
to tackle environmental challenges, the direct environmental impacts generated over the life
cycle of the physical devices are usually overlooked. It is implicitly assumed that their environmental
burden is negligible compared to the positive impacts they can generate. In this paper, we present
a parametric framework based on hardware profiles to evaluate the cradle-to-gate carbon footprint
of IoT edge devices. We exploit our framework in three ways. First, we apply it on four use cases to
evaluate their respective production carbon footprint. Then, we show that the heterogeneity inherent
to IoT edge devices must be considered as the production carbon footprint between simple and complex
devices can vary by a factor of more than 150x. Finally, we estimate the absolute carbon footprint
induced by the worldwide production of IoT edge devices through a macroscopic analysis over a 10-year
period. Results range from 22 to 562 MtCO2-eq/year in 2027 depending on the deployment scenarios.
However, the truncation error acknowledged for LCA bottom-up approaches usually lead to an undershoot
of the environmental impacts. We compared the results of our use cases with the few reports available
from Google and Apple, which suggest that our estimates could be revised upwards by a factor around
2x to compensate for the truncation error. Worst-case scenarios in 2027 would therefore reach more
than 1000 MtCO2-eq/year. This truly stresses the necessity to consider environmental constraints
when designing and deploying IoT edge devices.

Communicating effectively with customers is a challenge for many marketers, but especially in
a context that is both pivotal to individual long-term financial well-being and difficult to understand:
pensions. Around the world, participants are reluctant to consider their pension in advance, it
leads to a lack of preparation of their pension retirement [1], [2]. In order to engage participants
to obtain information on their expected pension benefits, personalizing the pension providers'
email communication is a first and crucial step. We describe a machine learning approach to model
email newsletters to fit participants' interests. The data for the modeling and analysis is collected
from newsletters sent by a large Dutch pension provider of the Netherlands and is divided into two
parts. The first part comprises 2,228,000 customers whereas the second part comprises the data
of a pilot study, which took place in July 2018 with 465,711 participants. In both cases, our algorithm
extracts features from continuous and categorical data using random forests, and then calculates
node embeddings of the decision boundaries of the random forest. We illustrate the algorithm's
effectiveness for the classification task, and how it can be used to perform data mining tasks. In
order to confirm that the result is valid for more than one data set, we also illustrate the properties
of our algorithm in benchmark data sets concerning churning. In the data sets considered, the proposed
modeling demonstrates competitive performance with respect to other state of the art approaches
based on random forests, achieving the best Area Under the Curve (AUC) in the pension data set (0.948).
For the descriptive part, the algorithm can identify customer segmentations that can be used by
marketing departments to better target their communication towards their customers.

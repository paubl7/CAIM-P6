The primary objective of our exploratory research is to contribute to the ongoing conversation
on Digital Afterlife from the lenses of Global South during the COVID-19 period. Digital Afterlife
is fast becoming a challenge for our increasingly connected society. Moreover, the situation got
worse with the COVID-19 pandemic. The on-going research is to address the disparity in the Global
South, specifically in countries like Indonesia, India and The Philippines compared to the Global
North for Digital Afterlife services such as policies and digital mourning services. By addressing
the research question, 'What services and policy frameworks are available for Digital Afterlife
in the Global South during COVID-19?', we aim to find the multitude of ways people in the Global South
are managing their digital footprints. Our preliminary findings show that some considerable research
and death related digital services and innovation have taken place during the pandemic. However,
overwhelming majority of these works are western-centric and mainly dealing with post-mortem
personal asset management. Cultural nuances, socio-economic perspectives, religion, political
climate, regional infrastructures are mostly sidelined. We found significant disparity in Digital
Afterlife product and service designs, which got worse during the global pandemic. Our goal is to
collect further in-depth data within the three big ICT powerhouses of global south (Indonesia,
India and The Philippines), identify the challenges as well as the innovations around Digital Afterlife.We
envision proposing a set of recommendations, based on our findings, for developing a more inclusive
and equitable digital space in this pandemic-stricken world.

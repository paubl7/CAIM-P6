In active perception tasks, an agent aims to select sensory actions that reduce its uncertainty
about one or more hidden variables. While partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs)
provide a natural model for such problems, reward functions that directly penalize uncertainty
in the agent's belief can remove the piecewise-linear and convex property of the value function
required by most POMDP planners. Furthermore, as the number of sensors available to the agent grows,
the computational cost of POMDP planning grows exponentially with it, making POMDP planning infeasible
with traditional methods. In this article, we address a twofold challenge of modeling and planning
for active perception tasks. We show the mathematical equivalence of $\rho$POMDP and POMDP-IR,
two frameworks for modeling active perception tasks, that restore the PWLC property of the value
function. To efficiently plan for active perception tasks, we identify and exploit the independence
properties of POMDP-IR to reduce the computational cost of solving POMDP-IR (and $\rho$POMDP).
We propose greedy point-based value iteration (PBVI), a new POMDP planning method that uses greedy
maximization to greatly improve scalability in the action space of an active perception POMDP.
Furthermore, we show that, under certain conditions, including submodularity, the value function
computed using greedy PBVI is guaranteed to have bounded error with respect to the optimal value
function. We establish the conditions under which the value function of an active perception POMDP
is guaranteed to be submodular. Finally, we present a detailed empirical analysis on a dataset collected
from a multi-camera tracking system employed in a shopping mall. Our method achieves similar performance
to existing methods but at a fraction of the computational cost leading to better scalability for
solving active perception tasks.

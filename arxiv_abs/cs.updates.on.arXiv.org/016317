The existence of simple uncoupled no-regret learning dynamics that converge to correlated equilibria
in normal-form games is a celebrated result in the theory of multi-agent systems. Specifically,
it has been known for more than 20 years that when all players seek to minimize their internal regret
in a repeated normal-form game, the empirical frequency of play converges to a normal-form correlated
equilibrium. Extensive-form games generalize normal-form games by modeling both sequential
and simultaneous moves, as well as imperfect information. Because of the sequential nature and
presence of private information in the game, correlation in extensive-form games possesses significantly
different properties than its counterpart in normal-form games, many of which are still open research
directions. Extensive-form correlated equilibrium (EFCE) has been proposed as the natural extensive-form
counterpart to the classical notion of correlated equilibrium in normal-form games. Compared
to the latter, the constraints that define the set of EFCEs are significantly more complex, as the
correlation device must keep into account the evolution of beliefs of each player as they make observations
throughout the game. Due to that significant added complexity, the existence of uncoupled learning
dynamics leading to an EFCE has remained a challenging open research question for a long time. In
this article, we settle that question by giving the first uncoupled no-regret dynamics that converge
to the set of EFCEs in n-player general-sum extensive-form games with perfect recall. We show that
each iterate can be computed in time polynomial in the size of the game tree, and that, when all players
play repeatedly according to our learning dynamics, the empirical frequency of play is proven to
be a O(T^-0.5)-approximate EFCE with high probability after T game repetitions, and an EFCE almost
surely in the limit.

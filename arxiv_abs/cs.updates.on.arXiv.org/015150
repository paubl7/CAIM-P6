Low-complexity beamformer design with practical constraints is an attractive research area for
hybrid analog/digital systems in mm-wave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). This
paper investigates interference-aware pre-beamformer (analog beamformer) design for joint
spatial division and multiplexing (JSDM) which is a user-grouping based two-stage beamforming
method. Single-carrier frequency domain equalization (SC-FDE) is employed in uplink frequency-selective
channels. First, unconstrained slowly changing statistical analog beamformer of each group,
namely, generalized eigenbeamformer (GEB) which has strong interference suppression capability
is designed where the mutual information in reduced dimension is maximized. Then, constant-modulus
constrained approximations of unconstrained beamformer are obtained by utilizing alternating
minimization algorithms for fully connected arrays and fixed subarrays. In addition, a dynamic
subarray algorithm is proposed where the connections between radio frequency (RF) chains and antennas
are changed with changing channel statistics. Convergence of the proposed alternating minimization-based
algorithms are provided along with their complexity analysis. It is observed that additional complexity
of proposed algorithms is insignificant for the overall system design. Although most of the interference
is suppressed with the help of proposed constrained beamformers, there may be some residual interference
after the analog beamforming stage. Therefore, linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) type digital
beamformers, which take the residual interference in reduced dimension into account, are proposed
instead of zero-forcing (ZF) type. Simulation results verify the superiority of the proposed interference-aware
constrained design over existing approaches in terms of beampattern, spectral efficiency, outage
capacity and channel estimation accuracy.

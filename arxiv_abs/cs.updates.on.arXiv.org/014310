The optimal scheduling of interfering links in a dense wireless network with full frequency reuse
is a challenging task. The traditional method involves first estimating all the interfering channel
strengths then optimizing the scheduling based on the model. This model-based method is however
resource intensive and computationally hard because channel estimation is expensive in dense
networks; furthermore, finding even a locally optimal solution of the resulting optimization
problem may be computationally complex. This paper shows that by using a deep learning approach,
it is possible to bypass the channel estimation and to schedule links efficiently based solely on
the geographic locations of the transmitters and the receivers, due to the fact that in many propagation
environments, the wireless channel strength is largely a function of the distance dependent path-loss.
This is accomplished by unsupervised training over randomly deployed networks, and by using a novel
neural network architecture that computes the geographic spatial convolutions of the interfering
or interfered neighboring nodes along with subsequent multiple feedback stages to learn the optimum
solution. The resulting neural network gives near-optimal performance for sum-rate maximization
and is capable of generalizing to larger deployment areas and to deployments of different link densities.
Moreover, to provide fairness, this paper proposes a novel scheduling approach that utilizes the
sum-rate optimal scheduling algorithm over judiciously chosen subsets of links for maximizing
a proportional fairness objective over the network. The proposed approach shows highly competitive
and generalizable network utility maximization results.

The latest threat to global health is the COVID-19 outbreak. Although there exist large datasets
of chest X-rays (CXR) and computed tomography (CT) scans, few COVID-19 image collections are currently
available due to patient privacy. At the same time, there is a rapid growth of COVID-19-relevant
articles in the biomedical literature. Here, we present COVID-19-CT-CXR, a public database of
COVID-19 CXR and CT images, which are automatically extracted from COVID-19-relevant articles
from the PubMed Central Open Access (PMC-OA) Subset. We extracted figures, associated captions,
and relevant figure descriptions in the article and separated compound figures into subfigures.
We also designed a deep-learning model to distinguish them from other figure types and to classify
them accordingly. The final database includes 1,327 CT and 263 CXR images (as of May 9, 2020) with
their relevant text. To demonstrate the utility of COVID-19-CT-CXR, we conducted four case studies.
(1) We show that COVID-19-CT-CXR, when used as additional training data, is able to contribute to
improved DL performance for the classification of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 CT. (2) We collected
CT images of influenza and trained a DL baseline to distinguish a diagnosis of COVID-19, influenza,
or normal or other types of diseases on CT. (3) We trained an unsupervised one-class classifier from
non-COVID-19 CXR and performed anomaly detection to detect COVID-19 CXR. (4) From text-mined captions
and figure descriptions, we compared clinical symptoms and clinical findings of COVID-19 vs. those
of influenza to demonstrate the disease differences in the scientific publications. We believe
that our work is complementary to existing resources and hope that it will contribute to medical
image analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic. The dataset, code, and DL models are publicly available

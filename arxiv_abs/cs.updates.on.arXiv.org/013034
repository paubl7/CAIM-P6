Enormous amounts of data are being produced everyday by sub-meters and smart sensors installed
in residential buildings. If leveraged properly, that data could assist end-users, energy producers
and utility companies in detecting anomalous power consumption and understanding the causes of
each anomaly. Therefore, anomaly detection could stop a minor problem becoming overwhelming.
Moreover, it will aid in better decision-making to reduce wasted energy and promote sustainable
and energy efficiency behavior. In this regard, this paper an in-depth review of existing anomaly
detection frameworks for building energy consumption based on artificial intelligence. Specifically,
an extensive survey is introduced, in which a comprehensive taxonomy is introduced to classify
existing algorithms based on different modules and parameters adopted in their implementation,
such as machine learning algorithms, feature extraction approaches, anomaly detection levels,
computing platforms and application scenarios. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this is the
first review article that discusses the anomaly detection in building energy consumption. Moving
forward, important findings along with domain-specific problems, difficulties and challenges
that remain unresolved are thoroughly discussed, including the absence of: (i) precise definitions
of anomalous power consumption, (ii) annotated datasets, (iii) unified metrics to assess the performance
of existing solutions, (iv) platforms for reproducibility, and (v) privacy-preservation. Following,
insights about current research trends are discussed to widen the application and effectiveness
of anomaly detection technology before deriving a set of future directions attracting significant
research and development.

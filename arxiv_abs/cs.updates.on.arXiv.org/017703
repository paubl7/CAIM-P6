This paper presents a four-stage algorithm for the realization of multi-input/multi-output (MIMO)
switched linear systems (SLSs) from Markov parameters. In the first stage, a linear time-varying
(LTV) realization that is topologically equivalent to the true SLS is derived from the Markov parameters
assuming that the submodels have a common MacMillan degree and a mild condition on their dwell times
holds. In the second stage, zero sets of LTV Hankel matrices where the realized system has a linear
time-invariant (LTI) pulse response matching that of the original SLS are exploited to extract
the submodels, up to arbitrary similarity transformations, by a clustering algorithm using a statistics
that is invariant to similarity transformations. Recovery is shown to be complete if the dwell times
are sufficiently long and some mild identifiability conditions are met. In the third stage, the
switching sequence is estimated by three schemes. The first scheme is based on forward/backward
corrections and works on the short segments. The second scheme matches Markov parameter estimates
to the true parameters for LTV systems and works on the medium-to-long segments. The third scheme
also matches Markov parameters, but for LTI systems only and works on the very short segments. In
the fourth stage, the submodels estimated in Stage 2 are brought to a common basis by applying a novel
basis transformation method which is necessary before performing output predictions to given
inputs. A numerical example illustrates the properties of the realization algorithm. A key role
in this algorithm is played by time-dependent switching sequences that partition the state-space
according to time, unlike many other works in the literature in which partitioning is state and/or
input dependent.

Here we provide evidence that the fundamental basis of nervous communication is derived from a pressure
pulse/soliton capable of computation with sufficient temporal precision to overcome any processing
errors. Signalling and computing within the nervous system are complex and different phenomena.
Action potentials are plastic and this makes the action potential peak an inappropriate fixed point
for neural computation, but the action potential threshold is suitable for this purpose. Furthermore,
neural models timed by spiking neurons operate below the rate necessary to overcome processing
error. Using retinal processing as our example, we demonstrate that the contemporary theory of
nerve conduction based on cable theory is inappropriate to account for the short computational
time necessary for the full functioning of the retina and by implication the rest of the brain. Moreover,
cable theory cannot be instrumental in the propagation of the action potential because at the activation-threshold
there is insufficient charge at the activation site for successive ion channels to be electrostatically
opened. Deconstruction of the brain neural network suggests that it is a member of a group of Quantum
phase computers of which the Turing machine is the simplest: the brain is another based upon phase
ternary computation. However, attempts to use Turing based mechanisms cannot resolve the coding
of the retina or the computation of intelligence, as the technology of Turing based computers is
fundamentally different. We demonstrate that that coding in the brain neural network is quantum
based, where the quanta have a temporal variable and a phase-base variable enabling phase ternary
computation as previously demonstrated in the retina.

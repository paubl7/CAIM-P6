Calcaneus is the largest tarsal bone to withstand the daily stresses of weight-bearing. The calcaneal
fracture is the most common type in the tarsal bone fractures. After a fracture is suspected, plain
radiographs should be taken first. Bohler's Angle (BA) and Critical Angle of Gissane (CAG), measured
by four anatomic landmarks in lateral foot radiograph, can guide fracture diagnosis and facilitate
operative recovery of the fractured calcaneus. This study aims to develop an analysis system that
can automatically locate four anatomic landmarks, measure BA and CAG for fracture assessment,
identify fractured calcaneus, and segment fractured regions. For landmark detection, we proposed
a coarse-to-fine Rotation-Invariant Regression-Voting (RIRV) landmark detection method based
on regressive Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) and Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) patch
descriptor, which solves the problem of fickle rotation of calcaneus. By implementing a novel normalization
approach, the RIRV method is explicitly rotation-invariance comparing with traditional regressive
methods. For fracture identification and segmentation, a convolution neural network (CNN) based
on U-Net with auxiliary classification head (U-Net-CH) is designed. The input ROIs of the CNN are
normalized by detected landmarks to uniform view, orientation, and scale. The advantage of this
approach is the multi-task learning that combines classification and segmentation. Our system
can accurately measure BA and CAG with a mean angle error of 3.8 and 6.2 respectively. For fracture
identification and fracture region segmentation, our system presents good performance with an
F1-score of 96.55%, recall of 94.99%, and segmentation IoU-score of 0.586.

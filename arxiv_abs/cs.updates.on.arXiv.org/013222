We study two questions related to competition on the OTC CDS market using data collected as part of
the EMIR regulation. First, we study the competition between central counterparties through collateral
requirements. We present models that successfully estimate the initial margin requirements.
However, our estimations are not precise enough to use them as input to a predictive model for CCP
choice by counterparties in the OTC market. Second, we model counterpart choice on the interdealer
market using a novel semi-supervised predictive task. We present our methodology as part of the
literature on model interpretability before arguing for the use of conditional entropy as the metric
of interest to derive knowledge from data through a model-agnostic approach. In particular, we
justify the use of deep neural networks to measure conditional entropy on real-world datasets.
We create the $\textit{Razor entropy}$ using the framework of algorithmic information theory
and derive an explicit formula that is identical to our semi-supervised training objective. Finally,
we borrow concepts from game theory to define $\textit{top-k Shapley values}$. This novel method
of payoff distribution satisfies most of the properties of Shapley values, and is of particular
interest when the value function is monotone submodular. Unlike classical Shapley values, top-k
Shapley values can be computed in quadratic time of the number of features instead of exponential.
We implement our methodology and report the results on our particular task of counterpart choice.
Finally, we present an improvement to the $\textit{node2vec}$ algorithm that could for example
be used to further study intermediation. We show that the neighbor sampling used in the generation
of biased walks can be performed in logarithmic time with a quasilinear time pre-computation, unlike
the current implementations that do not scale well.

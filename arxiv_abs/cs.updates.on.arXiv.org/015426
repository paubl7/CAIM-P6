Ridehailing applications that collect mobility data from individuals to inform smart city planning
predict each trip's fare pricing with automated algorithms that rely on artificial intelligence
(AI). This type of AI algorithm, namely a price discrimination algorithm, is widely used in the industry's
black box systems for dynamic individualized pricing. Lacking transparency, studying such AI
systems for fairness and disparate impact has not been possible without access to data used in generating
the outcomes of price discrimination algorithms. Recently, in an effort to enhance transparency
in city planning, the city of Chicago regulation mandated that transportation providers publish
anonymized data on ridehailing. As a result, we present the first large-scale measurement of the
disparate impact of price discrimination algorithms used by ridehailing applications. The application
of random effects models from the meta-analysis literature combines the city-level effects of
AI bias on fare pricing from census tract attributes, aggregated from the American Community Survey.
An analysis of 100 million ridehailing samples from the city of Chicago indicates a significant
disparate impact in fare pricing of neighborhoods due to AI bias learned from ridehailing utilization
patterns associated with demographic attributes. Neighborhoods with larger non-white populations,
higher poverty levels, younger residents, and high education levels are significantly associated
with higher fare prices, with combined effect sizes, measured in Cohen's d, of -0.32, -0.28, 0.69,
and 0.24 for each demographic, respectively. Further, our methods hold promise for identifying
and addressing the sources of disparate impact in AI algorithms learning from datasets that contain
U.S. geolocations.

We propose FlowReg, a deep learning-based framework for unsupervised image registration for neuroimaging
applications. The system is composed of two architectures that are trained sequentially: FlowReg-A
which affinely corrects for gross differences between moving and fixed volumes in 3D followed by
FlowReg-O which performs pixel-wise deformations on a slice-by-slice basis for fine tuning in
2D. The affine network regresses the 3D affine matrix based on a correlation loss function that enforces
global similarity. The deformable network operates on 2D image slices based on the optical flow
network FlowNet-Simple but with three loss components. The photometric loss minimizes pixel intensity
differences differences, the smoothness loss encourages similar magnitudes between neighbouring
vectors, and a correlation loss that is used to maintain the intensity similarity between fixed
and moving image slices. The proposed method is compared to four open source registration techniques
ANTs, Demons, SE, and Voxelmorph. In total, 4643 FLAIR MR imaging volumes are used from dementia
and vascular disease cohorts, acquired from over 60 international centres with varying acquisition
parameters. A battery of quantitative novel registration validation metrics are proposed that
focus on the structural integrity of tissues, spatial alignment, and intensity similarity. Experimental
results show FlowReg (FlowReg-A+O) performs better than iterative-based registration algorithms
for intensity and spatial alignment metrics with a Pixelwise Agreement of 0.65, correlation coefficient
of 0.80, and Mutual Information of 0.29. Among the deep learning frameworks, FlowReg-A or FlowReg-A+O
provided the highest performance over all but one of the metrics. Results show that FlowReg is able
to obtain high intensity and spatial similarity while maintaining the shape and structure of anatomy
and pathology.

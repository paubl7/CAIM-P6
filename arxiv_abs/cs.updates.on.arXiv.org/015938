Cross drainage hydraulic structures (i.e., culverts, bridges) in urban landscapes are prone to
getting blocked by transported debris which often results in causing the flash floods. In context
of Australia, Wollongong City Council (WCC) blockage conduit policy is the only formal guideline
to consider blockage in design process. However, many argue that this policy is based on the post
floods visual inspections and hence can not be considered accurate representation of hydraulic
blockage. As a result of this on-going debate, visual blockage and hydraulic blockage are considered
two distinct terms with no established quantifiable relation among both. This paper attempts to
relate both terms by proposing the use of deep visual features for prediction of hydraulic blockage
at a given culvert. An end-to-end machine learning pipeline is propounded which takes an image of
culvert as input, extract visual features using deep learning models, pre-process the visual features
and feed into regression model to predict the corresponding hydraulic blockage. Dataset (i.e.,
Hydrology-Lab Dataset (HD), Visual Hydrology-Lab Dataset (VHD)) used in this research was collected
from in-lab experiments carried out using scaled physical models of culverts where multiple blockage
scenarios were replicated at scale. Performance of regression models was assessed using standard
evaluation metrics. Furthermore, performance of overall machine learning pipeline was assessed
in terms of processing times for relative comparison of models and hardware requirement analysis.
From the results ANN used with MobileNet extracted visual features achieved the best regression
performance with $R^{2}$ score of 0.7855. Positive value of $R^{2}$ score indicated the presence
of correlation between visual features and hydraulic blockage and suggested that both can be interrelated
with each other.

White balance (WB) is one of the first photo-finishing steps used to render a captured image to its
final output. WB is applied to remove the color cast caused by the scene's illumination. Interactive
photo-editing software allows users to manually select different regions in a photo as examples
of the illumination for WB correction (e.g., clicking on achromatic objects). Such interactive
editing is possible only with images saved in a RAW image format. This is because RAW images have no
photo-rendering operations applied and photo-editing software is able to apply WB and other photo-finishing
procedures to render the final image. Interactively editing WB in camera-rendered images is significantly
more challenging. This is because the camera hardware has already applied WB to the image and subsequent
nonlinear photo-processing routines. These nonlinear rendering operations make it difficult
to change the WB post-capture. The goal of this paper is to allow interactive WB manipulation of camera-rendered
images. The proposed method is an extension of our recent work \cite{afifi2019color} that proposed
a post-capture method for WB correction based on nonlinear color-mapping functions. Here, we introduce
a new framework that links the nonlinear color-mapping functions directly to user-selected colors
to enable {\it interactive} WB manipulation. This new framework is also more efficient in terms
of memory and run-time (99\% reduction in memory and 3$\times$ speed-up). Lastly, we describe how
our framework can leverage a simple illumination estimation method (i.e., gray-world) to perform
auto-WB correction that is on a par with the WB correction results in \cite{afifi2019color}. The

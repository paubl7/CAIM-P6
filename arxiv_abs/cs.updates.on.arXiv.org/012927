During an epidemic, infectious individuals might not be detectable until some time after becoming
infected. The studies show that carriers with mild or no symptoms are the main contributors to the
transmission of a virus within the population. The average time it takes to develop the symptoms
causes a delay in the spread dynamics of the disease. When considering the influence of delay on the
disease propagation in epidemic networks, depending on the value of the time-delay and the network
topology, the peak of epidemic could be considerably different in time, duration, and intensity.
Motivated by the recent worldwide outbreak of the COVID-19 virus and the topological extent in which
this virus has spread over the course of a few months, this study aims to highlight the effect of time-delay
in the progress of such infectious diseases in the meta-population networks rather than individuals
or a single population. In this regard, the notions of epidemic network centrality in terms of the
underlying interaction graph of the network, structure of the uncertainties, and symptom development
duration are investigated to establish a centrality-based analysis of the disease evolution.
A convex traffic volume optimization method is then developed to control the outbreak. The control
process is done by identifying the sub-populations with the highest centrality and then isolating
them while maintaining the same overall traffic volume (motivated by economic considerations)
in the meta-population level. The numerical results, along with the theoretical expectations,
highlight the impact of time-delay as well as the importance of considering the worst-case scenarios
in investigating the most effective methods of epidemic containment.

In the agricultural sector, the COVID-19 threatens to lead to a severe food security crisis in the
region, with disruptions in the food supply chain and agricultural production expected to contract
between 2.6% and 7%. From the food crop production side, the travel bans and border closures, the
late reception and the use of agricultural inputs such as imported seeds, fertilizers, and pesticides
could lead to poor food crop production performances. Another layer of disruption introduced by
the mobility restriction measures is the scarcity of agricultural workers, mainly seasonal workers.
The lockdown measures and border closures limit seasonal workers' availability to get to the farm
on time for planting and harvesting activities. Moreover, most of the imported agricultural inputs
travel by air, which the pandemic has heavily impacted. Such transportation disruptions can also
negatively affect the food crop production system. This chapter assesses food crop production
levels in 2020 -- before the harvesting period -- in all African regions and four staples such as maize,
cassava, rice, and wheat. The production levels are predicted using the combination of biogeophysical
remote sensing data retrieved from satellite images and machine learning artificial neural networks
(ANNs) technique. The remote sensing products are used as input variables and the ANNs as the predictive
modeling framework. The input remote sensing products are the Normalized Difference Vegetation
Index (NDVI), the daytime Land Surface Temperature (LST), rainfall data, and agricultural lands'
Evapotranspiration (ET). The output maps and data are made publicly available on a web-based platform,
AAgWa (Africa Agriculture Watch, www.aagwa.org), to facilitate access to such information to
policymakers, deciders, and other stakeholders.

From popular uprisings to pandemics, the Web is an essential source consulted by scientists and
historians for reconstructing and studying past events. Unfortunately, the Web is plagued by reference
rot which causes important Web resources to disappear. Web archive collections help reduce the
costly effects of reference rot by saving Web resources that chronicle important stories/events
before they disappear. These collections often begin with URLs called seeds, hand-selected by
experts or scraped from social media. The quality of social media content varies widely, therefore,
we propose a framework for assigning multi-dimensional quality scores to social media seeds for
Web archive collections about stories and events. We leveraged contributions from social media
research for attributing quality to social media content and users based on credibility, reputation,
and influence. We combined these with additional contributions from the Web archive research that
emphasizes the importance of considering geographical and temporal constraints when selecting
seeds. Next, we developed the Quality Proxies (QP) framework which assigns seeds extracted from
social media a quality score across 10 major dimensions: popularity, geographical, temporal,
subject expert, retrievability, relevance, reputation, and scarcity. We instantiated the framework
and showed that seeds can be scored across multiple QP classes that map to different policies for
ranking seeds such as prioritizing seeds from local news, reputable and/or popular sources, etc.
The QP framework is extensible and robust. Our results showed that Quality Proxies resulted in the
selection of quality seeds with increased precision (by ~0.13) when novelty is and is not prioritized.
These contributions provide an explainable score applicable to rank and select quality seeds for
Web archive collections and other domains.

Various studies have shown that students tend to get higher marks when assessed through coursework
based assessment methods which include either modules that are fully assessed through coursework
or a mixture of coursework and examinations than assessed by examination alone. There are a large
number of educational data mining studies that preprocess data through conventional data mining
processes including data preparation process, but they are using transcript data as they stand
without looking at examination and coursework results weighting which could affect prediction
accuracy. This paper proposes a different data preparation process through investigating more
than 230000 student records in order to prepare students marks based on the assessment methods of
enrolled modules. The data have been processed through different stages in order to extract a categorical
factor through which students module marks are refined during the data preparation process. The
results of this work show that students final marks should not be isolated from the nature of the enrolled
modules assessment methods. They must rather be investigated thoroughly and considered during
EDMs data preprocessing phases. More generally, it is concluded that educational data should not
be prepared in the same way as other data types due to differences as data sources, applications,
and types of errors in them. Therefore, an attribute, coursework assessment ratio, is proposed
to be used in order to take the different modules assessment methods into account while preparing
student transcript data. The effect of CAR on prediction process using the random forest classification
technique has been investigated. It is shown that considering CAR as an attribute increases the
accuracy of predicting students second year averages based on their first year results.

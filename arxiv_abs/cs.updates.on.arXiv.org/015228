Background: Software is an important windows to offer a variety of complex instrument control and
data processing for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. NMR software should allow
researchers to flexibly implement various functionality according to the requirement of applications.
Scripting system can offer an open environment for NMR users to write custom programs with basic
libraries. Emerging technologies, especially multivariate statistical analysis and artificial
intelligence, have been successfully applied to NMR applications such as metabolomics and biomacromolecules.
Scripting system should support more complex NMR libraries, which will enable the emerging technologies
to be easily implemented in the scripting environment. Result: Here, a novel NMR scripting system
named "NMRPy" is introduced. In the scripting system, both Java based NMR methods and original CPython
based libraries are supported. A module was built as a bridge to integrate the runtime environment
of Java and CPython. It works as an extension in CPython environment, as well as interacts with Java
part by Java Native Interface. Leveraging the bridge, Java based instrument control and data processing
methods can be called as a CPython style. Compared with traditional scripting system, NMRPy is easier
for NMR researchers to develop complex functionality with fast numerical computation, multivariate
statistical analysis, deep learning etc. Non-uniform sampling and protein structure prediction
methods based on deep learning can be conveniently integrated into NMRPy. Conclusion: NMRPy offers
a user-friendly environment to implement custom functionality leveraging its powerful basic
NMR and rich CPython libraries. NMR applications with emerging technologies can be easily integrated.

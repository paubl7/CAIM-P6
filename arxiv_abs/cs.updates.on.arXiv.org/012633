Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has uncovered the potential of digital misinformation in shaping
the health of nations. The deluge of unverified information that spreads faster than the epidemic
itself is an unprecedented phenomenon that has put millions of lives in danger. Mitigating this
Infodemic requires strong health messaging systems that are engaging, vernacular, scalable,
effective and continuously learn the new patterns of misinformation. Objective: We created WashKaro,
a multi-pronged intervention for mitigating misinformation through conversational AI, machine
translation and natural language processing. WashKaro provides the right information matched
against WHO guidelines through AI, and delivers it in the right format in local languages. Methods:
We theorize (i) an NLP based AI engine that could continuously incorporate user feedback to improve
relevance of information, (ii) bite sized audio in the local language to improve penetrance in a
country with skewed gender literacy ratios, and (iii) conversational but interactive AI engagement
with users towards an increased health awareness in the community. Results: A total of 5026 people
who downloaded the app during the study window, among those 1545 were active users. Our study shows
that 3.4 times more females engaged with the App in Hindi as compared to males, the relevance of AI-filtered
news content doubled within 45 days of continuous machine learning, and the prudence of integrated
AI chatbot Satya increased thus proving the usefulness of an mHealth platform to mitigate health
misinformation. Conclusion: We conclude that a multi-pronged machine learning application delivering
vernacular bite-sized audios and conversational AI is an effective approach to mitigate health
misinformation.

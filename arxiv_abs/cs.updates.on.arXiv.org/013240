Chang's lemma (Duke Mathematical Journal, 2002) is a classical result with applications across
several areas in mathematics and computer science. For a Boolean function $f$ that takes values
in {-1,1} let $r(f)$ denote its Fourier rank. For each positive threshold $t$, Chang's lemma provides
a lower bound on $wt(f):=\Pr[f(x)=-1]$ in terms of the dimension of the span of its characters with
Fourier coefficients of magnitude at least $1/t$. We examine the tightness of Chang's lemma w.r.t.
the following three natural settings of the threshold: - the Fourier sparsity of $f$, denoted $k(f)$,
- the Fourier max-supp-entropy of $f$, denoted $k'(f)$, defined to be $\max \{1/|\hat{f}(S)| :
\hat{f}(S) \neq 0\}$, - the Fourier max-rank-entropy of $f$, denoted $k''(f)$, defined to be the
minimum $t$ such that characters whose Fourier coefficients are at least $1/t$ in absolute value
span a space of dimension $r(f)$. We prove new lower bounds on $wt(f)$ in terms of these measures.
One of our lower bounds subsumes and refines the previously best known upper bound on $r(f)$ in terms
of $k(f)$ by Sanyal (ToC, 2019). Another lower bound is based on our improvement of a bound by Chattopadhyay,
Hatami, Lovett and Tal (ITCS, 2019) on the sum of the absolute values of the level-$1$ Fourier coefficients.
We also show that Chang's lemma for the these choices of the threshold is asymptotically outperformed
by our bounds for most settings of the parameters involved. Next, we show that our bounds are tight
for a wide range of the parameters involved, by constructing functions (which are modifications
of the Addressing function) witnessing their tightness. Finally we construct Boolean functions
$f$ for which - our lower bounds asymptotically match $wt(f)$, and - for any choice of the threshold
$t$, the lower bound obtained from Chang's lemma is asymptotically smaller than $wt(f)$.

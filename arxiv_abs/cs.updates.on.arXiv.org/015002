The abolitionist movement of the nineteenth-century United States remains among the most significant
social and political movements in US history. Abolitionist newspapers played a crucial role in
spreading information and shaping public opinion around a range of issues relating to the abolition
of slavery. These newspapers also serve as a primary source of information about the movement for
scholars today, resulting in powerful new accounts of the movement and its leaders. This paper supplements
recent qualitative work on the role of women in abolition's vanguard, as well as the role of the Black
press, with a quantitative text modeling approach. Using diachronic word embeddings, we identify
which newspapers tended to lead lexical semantic innovations -- the introduction of new usages
of specific words -- and which newspapers tended to follow. We then aggregate the evidence across
hundreds of changes into a weighted network with the newspapers as nodes; directed edge weights
represent the frequency with which each newspaper led the other in the adoption of a lexical semantic
change. Analysis of this network reveals pathways of lexical semantic influence, distinguishing
leaders from followers, as well as others who stood apart from the semantic changes that swept through
this period. More specifically, we find that two newspapers edited by women -- THE PROVINCIAL FREEMAN
and THE LILY -- led a large number of semantic changes in our corpus, lending additional credence
to the argument that a multiracial coalition of women led the abolitionist movement in terms of both
thought and action. It also contributes additional complexity to the scholarship that has sought
to tease apart the relation of the abolitionist movement to the women's suffrage movement, and the
vexed racial politics that characterized their relation.

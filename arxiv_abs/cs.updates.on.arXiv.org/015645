Parameter retrieval and model inversion are key problems in remote sensing and Earth observation.
Currently, different approximations exist: a direct, yet costly, inversion of radiative transfer
models (RTMs); the statistical inversion with in situ data that often results in problems with extrapolation
outside the study area; and the most widely adopted hybrid modeling by which statistical models,
mostly nonlinear and non-parametric machine learning algorithms, are applied to invert RTM simulations.
We will focus on the latter. Among the different existing algorithms, in the last decade kernel based
methods, and Gaussian Processes (GPs) in particular, have provided useful and informative solutions
to such RTM inversion problems. This is in large part due to the confidence intervals they provide,
and their predictive accuracy. However, RTMs are very complex, highly nonlinear, and typically
hierarchical models, so that often a shallow GP model cannot capture complex feature relations
for inversion. This motivates the use of deeper hierarchical architectures, while still preserving
the desirable properties of GPs. This paper introduces the use of deep Gaussian Processes (DGPs)
for bio-geo-physical model inversion. Unlike shallow GP models, DGPs account for complicated
(modular, hierarchical) processes, provide an efficient solution that scales well to big datasets,
and improve prediction accuracy over their single layer counterpart. In the experimental section,
we provide empirical evidence of performance for the estimation of surface temperature and dew
point temperature from infrared sounding data, as well as for the prediction of chlorophyll content,
inorganic suspended matter, and coloured dissolved matter from multispectral data acquired by
the Sentinel-3 OLCI sensor. The presented methodology allows for more expressive forms of GPs in
remote sensing model inversion problems.

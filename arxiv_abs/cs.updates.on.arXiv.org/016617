Background: There is growing evidence that social and behavioral determinants of health (SBDH)
play a substantial effect in a wide range of health outcomes. Electronic health records (EHRs) have
been widely employed to conduct observational studies in the age of artificial intelligence (AI).
However, there has been little research into how to make the most of SBDH information from EHRs. Methods:
A systematic search was conducted in six databases to find relevant peer-reviewed publications
that had recently been published. Relevance was determined by screening and evaluating the articles.
Based on selected relevant studies, a methodological analysis of AI algorithms leveraging SBDH
information in EHR data was provided. Results: Our synthesis was driven by an analysis of SBDH categories,
the relationship between SBDH and healthcare-related statuses, and several NLP approaches for
extracting SDOH from clinical literature. Discussion: The associations between SBDH and health
outcomes are complicated and diverse; several pathways may be involved. Using Natural Language
Processing (NLP) technology to support the extraction of SBDH and other clinical ideas simplifies
the identification and extraction of essential concepts from clinical data, efficiently unlocks
unstructured data, and aids in the resolution of unstructured data-related issues. Conclusion:
Despite known associations between SBDH and disease, SBDH factors are rarely investigated as interventions
to improve patient outcomes. Gaining knowledge about SBDH and how SBDH data can be collected from
EHRs using NLP approaches and predictive models improves the chances of influencing health policy
change for patient wellness, and ultimately promoting health and health equity. Keywords: Social

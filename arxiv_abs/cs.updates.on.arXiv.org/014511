5G D2D Communication promises improvements in energy and spectral efficiency, overall system
capacity, and higher data rates. However, to achieve optimum results it is important to select wisely
the Transmission mode of the D2D Device to form clusters in the most fruitful positions in terms of
Sum Rate and Power Consumption. Towards this end, this paper investigates the use of Distributed
Artificial Intelligence (DAI) and innovative to D2D, Machine Learning (ML) approaches to achieve
satisfactory results in terms of Spectral Efficiency (SE), Power Consumption (PC) and execution
time, with the creation of clusters and backhauling D2D network under existing Base Station/Small
Cell. Additionally, one of the major factors that affect the creation of high-quality clusters
under a D2D network is the number of the Devices. Therefore, this paper focuses on a small (<=200)
number of Devices, with the purpose to identify the limits of each approach in terms of number of devices.
Specifically, to identify where it is beneficial to form a cluster, investigate the critical point
that gains increases rapidly and at the end examine the applicability of 5G requirements. Additionally,
prior work presented a Distributed Artificial Intelligence (DAI) Solution/Framework in D2D and
a DAIS Transmission Mode Selection (TMS) plan was proposed. In this paper DAIS is further examined,
improved in terms of thresholds evaluation, evaluated, and compared with other approaches (AI/ML).
The results obtained demonstrate the exceptional performance of DAIS, compared to all other related
approaches in terms of SE, PC, execution time and cluster formation efficiency. Also, results show
that the investigated AI/ML approaches are also beneficial for Transmission Mode Selection (TMS)
in 5G D2D communication, even with a smaller (>=5) number of devices as a lower limit.

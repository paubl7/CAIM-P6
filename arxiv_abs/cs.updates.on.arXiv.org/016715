Microprocessor design, debug, and validation research and development are increasingly based
on modeling and simulation at different abstraction layers. Microarchitecture-level simulators
have become the most commonly used tools for performance evaluation, due to their high simulation
throughput, compared to lower levels of abstraction, but usually come at the cost of loss of hardware
accuracy. As a result, the implementation, speed, and accuracy of microarchitectural simulators
are becoming more and more crucial for researchers and microprocessor architects. One of the most
critical aspects of a microarchitectural simulator is its ability to accurately express design
standards as various aspects of the microarchitecture change during design refinement. On the
other hand, modern microprocessor models rely on dedicated hardware implementations, making
the design space exploration a time-consuming process that can be performed using a variety of methods,
ranging from high-level models to hardware prototyping. Therefore, the tradeoff between simulation
speed and accuracy, can be significantly varied, and an application's performance measurements
uncertain. In this paper, we present a microarchitecture-level simulation modeling study, which
enables as accurate as possible performance modeling of a RISC-V out-of-order superscalar microprocessor
core. By diligently adjusting several important microarchitectural parameters of the widely
used gem5 simulator, we investigate the challenges of accurate performance modeling on microarchitecture-level
simulation compared to accuracy and low simulation throughput of RTL simulation of the target design.
Further, we demonstrate the main sources of errors that prevent high accuracy levels of the microarchitecture-level
modeling.

Most existing knowledge graphs suffer from incompleteness. Embedding knowledge graphs into continuous
vector spaces has recently attracted increasing interest in knowledge base completion. However,
in most existing embedding methods, only fact triplets are utilized, and logical rules have not
been thoroughly studied for the knowledge base completion task. To overcome the problem, we propose
an association rules enhanced knowledge graph attention network (AR-KGAT). The AR-KGAT captures
both entity and relation features for high-order neighborhoods of any given entity in an end-to-end
manner under the graph attention network framework. The major component of AR-KGAT is an encoder
of an effective neighborhood aggregator, which addresses the problems by aggregating neighbors
with both association-rules-based and graph-based attention weights. Additionally, the proposed
model also encapsulates the representations from multi-hop neighbors of nodes to refine their
embeddings. The decoder enables AR-KGAT to be translational between entities and relations while
keeping the superior link prediction performance. A logic-like inference pattern is utilized
as constraints for knowledge graph embedding. Then, the global loss is minimized over both atomic
and complex formulas to achieve the embedding task. In this manner, we learn embeddings compatible
with triplets and rules, which are certainly more predictive for knowledge acquisition and inference.
We conduct extensive experiments on two benchmark datasets: WN18RR and FB15k-237, for two knowledge
graph completion tasks: the link prediction and triplet classification to evaluate the proposed
AR-KGAT model. The results show that the proposed AR-KGAT model achieves significant and consistent
improvements over state-of-the-art methods.

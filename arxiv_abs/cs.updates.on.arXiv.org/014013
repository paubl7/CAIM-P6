Deep neural networks have received considerable attention in clinical imaging, particularly
with respect to the reduction of radiation risk. Lowering the radiation dose by reducing the photon
flux inevitably results in the degradation of the scanned image quality. Thus, researchers have
sought to exploit deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs) to map low-quality, low-dose images
to higher-dose, higher-quality images thereby minimizing the associated radiation hazard. Conversely,
computed tomography (CT) measurements of geomaterials are not limited by the radiation dose. In
contrast to the human body, however, geomaterials may be comprised of high-density constituents
causing increased attenuation of the X-Rays. Consequently, higher dosage images are required
to obtain an acceptable scan quality. The problem of prolonged acquisition times is particularly
severe for micro-CT based scanning technologies. Depending on the sample size and exposure time
settings, a single scan may require several hours to complete. This is of particular concern if phenomena
with an exponential temperature dependency are to be elucidated. A process may happen too fast to
be adequately captured by CT scanning. To address the aforementioned issues, we apply DCNNs to improve
the quality of rock CT images and reduce exposure times by more than 60\%, simultaneously. We highlight
current results based on micro-CT derived datasets and apply transfer learning to improve DCNN
results without increasing training time. The approach is applicable to any computed tomography
technology. Furthermore, we contrast the performance of the DCNN trained by minimizing different
loss functions such as mean squared error and structural similarity index.

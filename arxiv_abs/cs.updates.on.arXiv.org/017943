Automatic segmentation of shoulder muscle MRI is challenging due to the high variation in muscle
size, shape, texture, and spatial position of tears. Manual segmentation of tear and muscle portion
is hard, time-consuming, and subjective to pathological expertise. This work proposes a new Region
and Edge-based Deep Auto-Encoder (RE-DAE) for shoulder muscle MRI segmentation. The proposed
RE-DAE harmoniously employs average and max-pooling operation in the encoder and decoder blocks
of the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Region-based segmentation incorporated in the Deep
Auto-Encoder (DAE) encourages the network to extract smooth and homogenous regions. In contrast,
edge-based segmentation tries to learn the boundary and anatomical information. These two concepts,
systematically combined in a DAE, generate a discriminative and sparse hybrid feature space (exploiting
both region homogeneity and boundaries). Moreover, the concept of static attention is exploited
in the proposed RE-DAE that helps in effectively learning the tear region. The performances of the
proposed MRI segmentation based DAE architectures have been tested using a 3D MRI shoulder muscle
dataset using the hold-out cross-validation technique. The MRI data has been collected from the
Korea University Anam Hospital, Seoul, South Korea. Experimental comparisons have been conducted
by employing innovative custom-made and existing pre-trained CNN architectures both using transfer
learning and fine-tuning. Objective evaluation on the muscle datasets using the proposed SA-RE-DAE
showed a dice similarity of 85.58% and 87.07%, an accuracy of 81.57% and 95.58% for tear and muscle
regions, respectively. The high visual quality and the objective result suggest that the proposed
SA-RE-DAE is able to correctly segment tear and muscle regions in shoulder muscle MRI for better
clinical decisions.

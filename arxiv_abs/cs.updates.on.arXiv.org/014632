We investigate predicative aspects of order theory in constructive univalent foundations. By
predicative and constructive, we respectively mean that we do not assume Voevodsky's propositional
resizing axioms or excluded middle. Our work complements existing work on predicative mathematics
by exploring what cannot be done predicatively in univalent foundations. Our first main result
is that nontrivial (directed or bounded) complete posets are necessarily large. That is, if such
a nontrivial poset is small, then weak propositional resizing holds. It is possible to derive full
propositional resizing if we strengthen nontriviality to positivity. The distinction between
nontriviality and positivity is analogous to the distinction between nonemptiness and inhabitedness.
We prove our results for a general class of posets, which includes directed complete posets, bounded
complete posets and sup-lattices, using a technical notion of a $\delta_{\mathcal V}$-complete
poset. We also show that nontrivial locally small $\delta_{\mathcal V}$-complete posets necessarily
lack decidable equality. Specifically, we derive weak excluded middle from assuming a nontrivial
locally small $\delta_{\mathcal V}$-complete poset with decidable equality. Moreover, if we
assume positivity instead of nontriviality, then we can derive full excluded middle. Secondly,
we show that each of Zorn's lemma, Tarski's greatest fixed point theorem and Pataraia's lemma implies
propositional resizing. Hence, these principles are inherently impredicative and a predicative
development of order theory must therefore do without them. Finally, we clarify, in our predicative
setting, the relation between the traditional definition of sup-lattice that requires suprema
for all subsets and our definition that asks for suprema of all small families.

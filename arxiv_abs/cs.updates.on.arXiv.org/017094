We propose a distributed control algorithm for a multi-agent network whose agents deploy over a
cluttered region in accordance with a time-varying coverage density function while avoiding collisions
with all obstacles they encounter. Our algorithm is built on a two-level characterization of the
network. The first level treats the multi-agent network as a whole based on the distribution of the
locations of its agents over the spatial domain. In the second level, the network is described in
terms of the individual positions of its agents. The aim of the multi-agent network is to attain a
spatial distribution that resembles that of a reference coverage density function (high-level
problem) by means of local (microscopic) interactions of its agents (low-level problem). In addition,
as the agents deploy, they must avoid collisions with all the obstacles in the region at all times.
Our approach utilizes a modified version of Voronoi tessellations which are comprised of what we
refer to as Obstacle-Aware Voronoi Cells (OAVC) in order to enable coverage control while ensuring
obstacle avoidance. We consider two control problems. The first problem which we refer to as the
high-level coverage control problem corresponds to an interpolation problem in the class of Gaussian
mixtures (no collision avoidance requirement), which we solve analytically. The second problem
which we refer to as the low-level coverage control problem corresponds to a distributed control
problem (collision avoidance requirement is now enforced at all times) which is solved by utilizing
Lloyd's algorithm together with the modified Voronoi tessellation (OAVC) and a time-varying coverage
density function which corresponds to the solution of the high-level coverage control problem.
Finally, simulation results for coverage in a cluttered environment are provided to demonstrate
the efficacy of the proposed approach.

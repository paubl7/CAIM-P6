Learning from noisy labels is an important concern because of the lack of accurate ground-truth
labels in plenty of real-world scenarios. In practice, various approaches for this concern first
make some corrections corresponding to potentially noisy-labeled instances, and then update
predictive model with information of the made corrections. However, in specific areas, such as
medical histopathology whole slide image analysis (MHWSIA), it is often difficult or even impossible
for experts to manually achieve the noisy-free ground-truth labels which leads to labels with complex
noise. This situation raises two more difficult problems: 1) the methodology of approaches making
corrections corresponding to potentially noisy-labeled instances has limitations due to the
complex noise existing in labels; and 2) the appropriate evaluation strategy for validation/testing
is unclear because of the great difficulty in collecting the noisy-free ground-truth labels. In
this paper, we focus on alleviating these two problems. For the problem 1), we present one-step abductive
multi-target learning (OSAMTL) that imposes a one-step logical reasoning upon machine learning
via a multi-target learning procedure to constrain the predictions of the learning model to be subject
to our prior knowledge about the true target. For the problem 2), we propose a logical assessment
formula (LAF) that evaluates the logical rationality of the outputs of an approach by estimating
the consistencies between the predictions of the learning model and the logical facts narrated
from the results of the one-step logical reasoning of OSAMTL. Applying OSAMTL and LAF to the Helicobacter
pylori (H. pylori) segmentation task in MHWSIA, we show that OSAMTL is able to enable the machine
learning model achieving logically more rational predictions, which is beyond various state-of-the-art
approaches in handling complex noisy labels.

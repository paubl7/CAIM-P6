We developed two machine learning frameworks that could assist in automated litho-stratigraphic
interpretation of seismic volumes without any manual hand labeling from an experienced seismic
interpreter. The first framework is an unsupervised hierarchical clustering model to divide seismic
images from a volume into certain number of clusters determined by the algorithm. The clustering
framework uses a combination of density and hierarchical techniques to determine the size and homogeneity
of the clusters. The second framework consists of a self-supervised deep learning framework to
label regions of geological interest in seismic images. It projects the latent-space of an encoder-decoder
architecture unto two orthogonal subspaces, from which it learns to delineate regions of interest
in the seismic images. To demonstrate an application of both frameworks, a seismic volume was clustered
into various contiguous clusters, from which four clusters were selected based on distinct seismic
patterns: horizons, faults, salt domes and chaotic structures. Images from the selected clusters
are used to train the encoder-decoder network. The output of the encoder-decoder network is a probability
map of the possibility an amplitude reflection event belongs to an interesting geological structure.
The structures are delineated using the probability map. The delineated images are further used
to post-train a segmentation model to extend our results to full-vertical sections. The results
on vertical sections show that we can factorize a seismic volume into its corresponding structural
components. Lastly, we showed that our deep learning framework could be modeled as an attribute
extractor and we compared our attribute result with various existing attributes in literature
and demonstrate competitive performance with them.

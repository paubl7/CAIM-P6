Information extraction from narrative clinical notes is useful for patient care, as well as for
secondary use of medical data, for research or clinical purposes. Many studies focused on information
extraction from English clinical texts, but less dealt with clinical notes in languages other than
English. This study tested the feasibility of using 'off the shelf' information extraction algorithms
to identify medical concepts from Italian clinical notes. We used MetaMap to map medical concepts
to the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS). The study addressed two questions: (Q1) to understand
if it would be possible to properly map medical terms found in clinical notes and related to the semantic
group of 'Disorders' to the Italian UMLS resources; (Q2) to investigate if it would be feasible to
use MetaMap as it is to extract these medical concepts from Italian clinical notes. Results in EXP1
showed that the Italian UMLS Metathesaurus sources covered 91% of the medical terms of the 'Disorders'
semantic group, as found in the studied dataset. Even if MetaMap was built to analyze texts written
in English, it worked properly also with texts written in Italian. MetaMap identified correctly
about half of the concepts in the Italian clinical notes. Using MetaMap's annotation on Italian
clinical notes instead of a simple text search improved our results of about 15 percentage points.
MetaMap showed recall, precision and F-measure of 0.53, 0.98 and 0.69, respectively. Most of the
failures were due to the impossibility for MetaMap to generate Italian meaningful variants. MetaMap's
performance in annotating automatically translated English clinical notes was in line with findings
in the literature, with similar recall (0.75), F-measure (0.83) and even higher precision (0.95).

A useful approach to solve inverse problems is to pair the parameter-to-data map with a stochastic
dynamical system for the parameter, and then employ techniques from filtering to estimate the parameter
given the data. Three classical approaches to filtering of nonlinear systems are the extended,
ensemble and unscented Kalman filters. The extended Kalman inversion (ExKI) is impractical when
the forward map is not readily differentiable and given as a black box, and also for high dimensional
parameter spaces because of the need to propagate large covariance matrices. Ensemble Kalman inversion
(EKI) has emerged as a useful tool which overcomes both of these issues: it is derivative free and
works with a low-rank covariance approximation formed from the ensemble. In this paper, we demonstrate
that unscented Kalman methods also provide an effective tool for derivative-free inversion in
the setting of black-box forward models, introducing unscented Kalman inversion (UKI). Theoretical
analysis is provided for linear inverse problems, and a smoothing property of the data mis-fit under
the unscented transform is explained. We provide numerical experiments, including various applications:
learning subsurface flow permeability parameters; learning the structure damage field; learning
the Navier-Stokes initial condition; and learning subgrid-scale parameters in a general circulation
model. The theory and experiments show that the UKI outperforms the EKI on parameter learning problems
with moderate numbers of parameters and outperforms the ExKI on problems where the forward model
is not readily differentiable, or where the derivative is very sensitive. In particular, UKI based
methods are of particular value for parameter estimation problems in which the number of parameters
is moderate but the forward model is expensive and provided as a black box which is impractical to
differentiate.

Recent controversies related to topics such as fake news, privacy, and algorithmic bias have prompted
increased public scrutiny of digital technologies and soul-searching among many of the people
associated with their development. In response, the tech industry, academia, civil society, and
governments have rapidly increased their attention to "ethics" in the design and use of digital
technologies ("tech ethics"). Yet almost as quickly as ethics discourse has proliferated across
the world of digital technologies, the limitations of these approaches have also become apparent:
tech ethics is vague and toothless, is subsumed into corporate logics and incentives, and has a myopic
focus on individual engineers and technology design rather than on the structures and cultures
of technology production. As a result of these limitations, many have grown skeptical of tech ethics
and its proponents, charging them with "ethics-washing": promoting ethics research and discourse
to defuse criticism and government regulation without committing to ethical behavior. By looking
at how ethics has been taken up in both science and business in superficial and depoliticizing ways,
I recast tech ethics as a terrain of contestation where the central fault line is not whether it is
desirable to be ethical, but what "ethics" entails and who gets to define it. This framing highlights
the significant limits of current approaches to tech ethics and the importance of studying the formulation
and real-world effects of tech ethics. In order to identify and develop more rigorous strategies
for reforming digital technologies and the social relations that they mediate, I describe a sociotechnical
approach to tech ethics, one that reflexively applies many of tech ethics' own lessons regarding
digital technologies to tech ethics itself.

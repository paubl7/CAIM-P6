Context: Prior research has established that a small proportion of individuals dominate team communication
during global software development. It is not known, however, how these members' contributions
affect their teams' knowledge diffusion process, or whether their personality profiles are responsible
for their dominant presence. Objective: We set out to address this gap through the study of repository
artifacts. Method: Artifacts from ten teams were mined from the IBM Rational Jazz repository. We
employed social network analysis (SNA) to group practitioners into two clusters, Top Members and
Others, based on the numbers of messages they communicated and their engagement in task changes.
SNA metrics (density, in-degree and closeness) were then used to study practitioners' importance
in knowledge diffusion. Thereafter, we performed psycholinguistic analysis on practitioners'
messages using linguistic dimensions that had been previously correlated with the Big Five personality
profiles. Results: For our sample of 146 practitioners we found that Top Members occupied critical
roles in knowledge diffusion, and demonstrated more openness to experience than the Others. Additionally,
all personality profiles were represented during teamwork, although openness to experience,
agreeableness and extroversion were particularly evident. However, no specific personality
predicted members' involvement in knowledge diffusion. Conclusion: Task assignment that promotes
highly connected team communication networks may mitigate tacit knowledge loss in global software
teams. Additionally, while members expressing openness to experience are likely to be particularly
driven to perform, this is not entirely responsible for a global team's success.

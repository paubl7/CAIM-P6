Job Title Benchmarking (JTB) aims at matching job titles with similar expertise levels across various
companies. JTB could provide precise guidance and considerable convenience for both talent recruitment
and job seekers for position and salary calibration/prediction. Traditional JTB approaches mainly
rely on manual market surveys, which is expensive and labor-intensive. Recently, the rapid development
of Online Professional Graph has accumulated a large number of talent career records, which provides
a promising trend for data-driven solutions. However, it is still a challenging task since (1) the
job title and job transition (job-hopping) data is messy which contains a lot of subjective and non-standard
naming conventions for the same position (e.g., Programmer, Software Development Engineer, SDE,
Implementation Engineer), (2) there is a large amount of missing title/transition information,
and (3) one talent only seeks limited numbers of jobs which brings the incompleteness and randomness
modeling job transition patterns. To overcome these challenges, we aggregate all the records to
construct a large-scale Job Title Benchmarking Graph (Job-Graph), where nodes denote job titles
affiliated with specific companies and links denote the correlations between jobs. We reformulate
the JTB as the task of link prediction over the Job-Graph that matched job titles should have links.
Along this line, we propose a collective multi-view representation learning method (Job2Vec)
by examining the Job-Graph jointly in (1) graph topology view, (2)semantic view, (3) job transition
balance view, and (4) job transition duration view. We fuse the multi-view representations in the
encode-decode paradigm to obtain a unified optimal representation for the task of link prediction.
Finally, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

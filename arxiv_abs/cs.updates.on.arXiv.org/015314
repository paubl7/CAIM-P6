LTE-Licensed Assisted Access (LAA) networks are beginning to be deployed widely in major metropolitan
areas in the US in the unlicensed 5 GHz bands, which have existing dense deployments of Wi-Fi. This
provides a real-world opportunity to study the problems due to hidden-node scenarios between LAA
and Wi-Fi. The hidden node problem has been well studied in the context of overlapping Wi-Fi APs.
However, when Wi-Fi coexists with LAA, the hidden node problem is exacerbated since LAA cannot use
the well-known Request-to-Send (RTS)/Clear to-Send (CTS) mechanism to resolve contentions,
resulting in throughput degradation for Wi-Fi. In this paper, we describe detailed measurements
and conclusions from experiments on the campus of the University of Chicago which presents a perfect
hidden node scenario where Wi-Fi access points (APs) controlled by us and an LAA base-station (BS)
deployed by AT&T are hidden from each other, but the clients are not. We performed careful experiments
in three different regions of the coexistence area: (i) clients midway between LAA & Wi-Fi; (ii)
clients close to the Wi-Fi AP; and (iii) clients close to the LAA BS. Our results show that in a situation
where LAA uses an aggregate of three unlicensed channels (60 MHz bandwidth) which overlap with an
80 MHz Wi-Fi transmission, the Wi-Fi throughput at client devices suffers considerably. Overall,
Wi-Fi performance is impacted by the hidden node problem more severely than LAA. In the best outdoor
conditions, the throughput of LAA and Wi-Fi is reduced by 35% and 97% respectively when coexisting
with each other as compared when the other system is not present. Furthermore, we conclude that when
both LAA and Wi-Fi use multiple 20 MHz channels and there are multiple Wi-Fi APs coexisting with LAA
on the same set of channels, the choice of Wi-Fi primary channels can have a significant impact on
LAA throughput.

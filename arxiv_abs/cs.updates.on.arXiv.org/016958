Nowadays, there are ubiquitousness of GPS sensors in various devices collecting, transmitting
and storing tremendous trajectory data. However, such an unprecedented scale of GPS data has posed
an urgent demand for not only an effective storage mechanism but also an efficient query mechanism.
Line simplification in online mode, searving as a mainstream trajectory compression method, plays
an important role to attack this issue. But for the existing algorithms, either their time cost is
extremely high, or the accuracy loss after the compression is completely unacceptable. To attack
this issue, we propose $\epsilon \_$Region based Online trajectory Compression with Error bounded
(ROCE for short), which makes the best balance among the accuracy loss, the time cost and the compression
rate. The range query serves as a primitive, yet quite essential operation on analyzing trajectories.
Each trajectory is usually seen as a sequence of discrete points, and in most previous work, a trajectory
is judged to be overlapped with the query region R iff there is at least one point in this trajectory
falling in R. But this traditional criteria is not suitable when the queried trajectories are compressed,
because there may be hundreds of points discarded between each two adjacent points and the points
in each compressed trajectory are quite sparse. And many trajectories could be missing in the result
set. To address this, in this paper, a new criteria based on the probability and an efficient Range
Query processing algorithm on Compressed trajectories RQC are proposed. In addition, an efficient
index \emph{ASP\_tree} and lots of novel techniques are also presented to accelerate the processing
of trajectory compression and range queries obviously. Extensive experiments have been done on
multiple real datasets, and the results demonstrate superior performance of our methods.

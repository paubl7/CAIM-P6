Manual count of mitotic figures, which is determined in the tumor region with the highest mitotic
activity, is a key parameter of most tumor grading schemes. It can be, however, strongly dependent
on the area selection due to uneven mitotic figure distribution in the tumor section.We aimed to
assess the question, how significantly the area selection could impact the mitotic count, which
has a known high inter-rater disagreement. On a data set of 32 whole slide images of H&E-stained canine
cutaneous mast cell tumor, fully annotated for mitotic figures, we asked eight veterinary pathologists
(five board-certified, three in training) to select a field of interest for the mitotic count. To
assess the potential difference on the mitotic count, we compared the mitotic count of the selected
regions to the overall distribution on the slide.Additionally, we evaluated three deep learning-based
methods for the assessment of highest mitotic density: In one approach, the model would directly
try to predict the mitotic count for the presented image patches as a regression task. The second
method aims at deriving a segmentation mask for mitotic figures, which is then used to obtain a mitotic
density. Finally, we evaluated a two-stage object-detection pipeline based on state-of-the-art
architectures to identify individual mitotic figures. We found that the predictions by all models
were, on average, better than those of the experts. The two-stage object detector performed best
and outperformed most of the human pathologists on the majority of tumor cases. The correlation
between the predicted and the ground truth mitotic count was also best for this approach (0.963 to
0.979). Further, we found considerable differences in position selection between pathologists,
which could partially explain the high variance that has been reported for the manual mitotic count.

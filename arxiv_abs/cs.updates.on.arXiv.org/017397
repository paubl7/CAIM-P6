The predict-then-optimize framework is fundamental in many practical settings: predict the unknown
parameters of an optimization problem, and then solve the problem using the predicted values of
the parameters. A natural loss function in this environment is to consider the cost of the decisions
induced by the predicted parameters, in contrast to the prediction error of the parameters. This
loss function was recently introduced in Elmachtoub and Grigas (2017) and referred to as the Smart
Predict-then-Optimize (SPO) loss. In this work, we seek to provide bounds on how well the performance
of a prediction model fit on training data generalizes out-of-sample, in the context of the SPO loss.
Since the SPO loss is non-convex and non-Lipschitz, standard results for deriving generalization
bounds do not apply. We first derive bounds based on the Natarajan dimension that, in the case of a
polyhedral feasible region, scale at most logarithmically in the number of extreme points, but,
in the case of a general convex feasible region, have linear dependence on the decision dimension.
By exploiting the structure of the SPO loss function and a key property of the feasible region, which
we denote as the strength property, we can dramatically improve the dependence on the decision and
feature dimensions. Our approach and analysis rely on placing a margin around problematic predictions
that do not yield unique optimal solutions, and then providing generalization bounds in the context
of a modified margin SPO loss function that is Lipschitz continuous. Finally, we characterize the
strength property and show that the modified SPO loss can be computed efficiently for both strongly
convex bodies and polytopes with an explicit extreme point representation.

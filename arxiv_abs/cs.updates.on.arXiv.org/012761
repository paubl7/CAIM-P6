On a daily basis, law enforcement officers struggle with suspects using mobile communication applications
for criminal activities. These mobile applications replaced SMS-messaging and evolved the last
few years from plain-text data transmission and storage to an encrypted version. Regardless of
the benefits for all law abiding citizens, this is considered to be the downside for criminal investigations.
Normal smartphone, computer or network investigations do no longer provide the contents of the
communication in real-time when suspects are using apps like WhatsApp, Signal or Telegram. Among
them, WhatsApp is one of the most common smartphone applications for communication, both criminal
as well as legal activities. Early 2016 WhatsApp introduced end-to-end encryption for all users,
immediately keeping law enforcement officers around the world in the dark. Existing research to
recuperate the position of law enforcement is limited to a single field of investigation and often
limited to post mortem research on smartphone or computer while wiretapping is limited to metadata
information. Therefore, it provides only historical data or metadata while law enforcement officers
want a continuous stream of live and substantive information. This paper identified that gap in
available scenarios for law enforcement investigations and identified a gap in methods available
for forensic acquiring and processing these scenarios. In this paper, we propose a forensic approach
to create real-time insight in the WhatsApp communication. Our approach is based on the wiretapping,
decrypting WhatsApp databases, open source intelligence and WhatsApp Web communication analysis.
We also evaluate our method with different scenarios in WhatsApp forensics to prove its feasibility
and efficiency.

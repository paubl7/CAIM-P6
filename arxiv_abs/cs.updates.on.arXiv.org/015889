Deep neural networks generalize well despite being exceedingly overparameterized and being trained
without explicit regularization. This curious phenomenon, often termed benign overfitting,
has inspired extensive research activity in establishing its statistical principles: Under what
conditions is the phenomenon observed? How do these depend on the data and on the training algorithm?
When does regularization benefit generalization? While these questions remain wide open for deep
neural nets, recent works have attempted gaining insights by studying simpler, often linear, models.
Our paper contributes to this growing line of work by examining binary linear classification under
the popular generative Gaussian mixture model. Motivated by recent results on the implicit bias
of gradient descent, we study both max-margin SVM classifiers (corresponding to logistic loss)
and min-norm interpolating classifiers (corresponding to least-squares loss). First, we leverage
an idea introduced in [V. Muthukumar et al., arXiv:2005.08054, (2020)] to relate the SVM solution
to the least-squares (LS) interpolating solution. Second, we derive novel non-asymptotic bounds
on the classification error of the LS solution. Combining the two, we present novel sufficient conditions
on the overparameterization ratio and on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for benign overfitting
to occur. Contrary to previously studied discriminative data models, our results emphasize the
crucial role of the SNR. Moreover, we investigate the role of regularization and identify precise
conditions under which the interpolating estimator performs better than the regularized estimates.
We corroborate our theoretical findings with numerical simulations.

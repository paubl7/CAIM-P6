One of the grand challenges discussed during the Dagstuhl Seminar "Knowledge Graphs: New Directions
for Knowledge Representation on the Semantic Web" and described in its report is that of a: "Public
FAIR Knowledge Graph of Everything: We increasingly see the creation of knowledge graphs that capture
information about the entirety of a class of entities. [...] This grand challenge extends this further
by asking if we can create a knowledge graph of "everything" ranging from common sense concepts to
location based entities. This knowledge graph should be "open to the public" in a FAIR manner democratizing
this mass amount of knowledge." Although linked open data (LOD) is one knowledge graph, it is the
closest realisation (and probably the only one) to a public FAIR Knowledge Graph (KG) of everything.
Surely, LOD provides a unique testbed for experimenting and evaluating research hypotheses on
open and FAIR KG. One of the most neglected FAIR issues about KGs is their ongoing evolution and long
term preservation. We want to investigate this problem, that is to understand what preserving and
supporting the evolution of KGs means and how these problems can be addressed. Clearly, the problem
can be approached from different perspectives and may require the development of different approaches,
including new theories, ontologies, metrics, strategies, procedures, etc. This document reports
a collaborative effort performed by 9 teams of students, each guided by a senior researcher as their
mentor, attending the International Semantic Web Research School (ISWS 2019). Each team provides
a different perspective to the problem of knowledge graph evolution substantiated by a set of research
questions as the main subject of their investigation. In addition, they provide their working definition
for KG preservation and evolution.

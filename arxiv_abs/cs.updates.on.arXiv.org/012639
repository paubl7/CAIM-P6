Waymo's mission to reduce traffic injuries and fatalities and improve mobility for all has led us
to expand deployment of automated vehicles on public roads without a human driver behind the wheel.
As part of this process, Waymo is committed to providing the public with informative and relevant
data regarding the demonstrated safety of Waymo's automated driving system, which we call the Waymo
Driver. The data presented in this paper represents more than 6.1 million miles of automated driving
in the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area, including operations with a trained operator behind
the steering wheel from calendar year 2019 and 65,000 miles of driverless operation without a human
behind the steering wheel from 2019 and the first nine months of 2020. The paper includes every collision
and minor contact experienced during these operations as well as every predicted contact identified
using Waymo's counterfactual, what if, simulation of events had the vehicle's trained operator
not disengaged automated driving. There were 47 contact events that occurred over this time period,
consisting of 18 actual and 29 simulated contact events, none of which would be expected to result
in severe or life threatening injuries. This paper presents the collision typology and severity
for each actual and simulated event, along with diagrams depicting each of the most significant
events. Nearly all the events involved one or more road rule violations or other errors by a human
driver or road user, including all eight of the most severe events, which we define as involving actual
or expected airbag deployment in any involved vehicle. When compared to national collision statistics,
the Waymo Driver completely avoided certain collision modes that human driven vehicles are frequently
involved in, including road departure and collisions with fixed objects.

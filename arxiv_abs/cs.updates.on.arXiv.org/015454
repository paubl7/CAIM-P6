A mathematical model for anaerobic digestion in plug-flow reactors is proposed on the basis of mass
balance considerations. The model consists of a system of parabolic partial differential equations
for the variables representing the concentrations of the bio-components constituting the waste
matrix and takes into account convective and diffusive phenomena. The plug-flow reactor is modelled
as a one-dimensional domain; the waste matrix moves in the direction of the reactor axis and undergoes
diffusive phenomena which reproduce the movement of the bio-components along the reactor axis
due to a gradient in concentration. The velocity characterizing the convection of the waste matrix
is not fixed a priori but it is considered as an additional unknown of the mathematical problem. The
variation in the convective velocity allows to account the mass variation occurring along a plug-flow
reactor due to the conversion of solids. The equation governing the convective velocity is derived
by considering the density of the waste matrix within the reactor constant over time and the sum of
the volume fractions of the bio-components constituting the waste matrix constrained to unity.
The waste matrix undergoes biochemical transformations catalysed by anaerobic microbial species
which lead to the production of gaseous methane, the final product of the anaerobic digestion process.
Biochemical processes are modelled using a simplified scheme and a differential equation is used
to describe the dynamics of the produced gaseous methane. A finite difference scheme is used for
the numerical integration. Model consistency is showed through numerical simulations which investigate
the effect of the variation of some operating parameters on process performance. The model is then
applied to a real case scenario of engineering interest. Simulations produce results in good agreement
with experimental observations.

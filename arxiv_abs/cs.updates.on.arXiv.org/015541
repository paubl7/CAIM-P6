An imbalance in gender representation has been identified across many fields of academic research.
Men are disproportionately represented, especially at senior career stages. Efforts to increase
recruitment of women into training programs has increased representation in many fields, but a
"leaky pipeline" is still observed: a disproportionate number of women leave research before obtaining
an independent position. To understand factors that lead to attrition of women from academic research,
we analyzed a database of mentoring relationships covering the period 2000 to 2015 in several science
and humanities fields. While representation of women has increased over time among both trainees
and independent researchers, male graduate students and postdocs still continue to independent
research at higher rates than their women colleagues. We analyzed aspects of the mentoring relationship
that contribute to this continuing bias. One strong pattern that is observed is homophily, where
trainees and mentors tend to be of the same gender. It has been hypothesized that institutional bias
may limit the influence of female investigators, which could in turn impact the retention of their
trainees in academia. Indeed, we observe trainees of female mentors are less likely to continue
into independent research careers than trainees of male mentors. This disparity persists, but
is reduced, after controlling for temporal trends in retention rates and under-representation
of women mentors at the highest levels of funding and citation. Although the trainee pool for mentors
that receive highly prestigious awards is skewed towards men, homophily is otherwise unrelated
to mentor achievement. These results suggest that, in addition to other factors that limit career
choices for female trainees, institutional bias that gives female mentors access to fewer resources
contributes to the leaky pipeline for gender.

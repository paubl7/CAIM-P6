After the pandemic of SARS-CoV-2, it has influenced the health care practices around the world.
Initial investigations indicate that patients with comorbidities are more fragile to this SARS-CoV-2
infection. They suggested postponing the routine treatment of cancer patients. However, few meta-analyses
suggested evidences are not sufficient to hold the claim of the frailty of cancer patients to COVID-19,
and they are not in favour of shelving the scheduled procedures. There are recent studies in which
medical professionals, according to their competence, are referring to change the routine practices
on how to manage the applicable therapeutic resources judiciously to combat this vital infection.
This is a different study that reveals the cancer patients' viewpoint about how health care practices
have been changed in their opinion during this pandemic year? Are they satisfied with their treatment
or not? To serve the purpose, we gathered more than 60000 relevant tweets from Twitter to analyse
the sentiment of cancer patients around the world. Our findings demonstrate that there is a surge
in argument about cancer and its treatment after the outbreak of COVID-19. Most of the tweets are
reasonable (52.6%) compared to the negative ones (24.3). We developed polarity and subjectivity
distribution to better recognise the positivity/negativity in the sentiment. Results reveal
that the polarity range of positive tweets is within the range of 0 to 0.5. Which means the tendency
in the tweets is not so much positive but surely not negative. It is a piece of modest statistical evidence
in support of how natural language processing (NLP) can be accepted to better understand the patient's
behaviour in real-time, and it may facilitate the medical professional to make better decision
to organise the routine management of cancer patients.

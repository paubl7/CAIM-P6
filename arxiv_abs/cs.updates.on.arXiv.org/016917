The elasto-plastic material behavior, material strength and failure modes of metals fabricated
by additive manufacturing technologies are significantly determined by the underlying process-specific
microstructure evolution. In this work a novel physics-based and data-supported phenomenological
microstructure model for Ti-6Al-4V is proposed that is suitable for the part-scale simulation
of selective laser melting processes. The model predicts spatially homogenized phase fractions
of the most relevant microstructural species, namely the stable $\beta$-phase, the stable $\alpha_{\text{s}}$-phase
as well as the metastable Martensite $\alpha_{\text{m}}$-phase, in a physically consistent manner.
In particular, the modeled microstructure evolution, in form of diffusion-based and non-diffusional
transformations, is a pure consequence of energy and mobility competitions among the different
species, without the need for heuristic transformation criteria as often applied in existing models.
The mathematically consistent formulation of the evolution equations in rate form renders the
model suitable for the practically relevant scenario of temperature- or time-dependent diffusion
coefficients, arbitrary temperature profiles, and multiple coexisting phases. Due to its physically
motivated foundation, the proposed model requires only a minimal number of free parameters, which
are determined in an inverse identification process considering a broad experimental data basis
in form of time-temperature transformation diagrams. Subsequently, the predictive ability of
the model is demonstrated by means of continuous cooling transformation diagrams, showing that
experimentally observed characteristics such as critical cooling rates emerge naturally from
the proposed microstructure model, instead of being enforced as heuristic transformation criteria.

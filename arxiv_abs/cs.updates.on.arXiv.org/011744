In breakthrough work, Tardos (Oper. Res. '86) gave a proximity based framework for solving linear
programming (LP) in time depending only on the constraint matrix in the bit complexity model. In
Tardos's framework, one reduces solving the LP $\min \langle c,{x}\rangle$, $Ax=b$, $x \geq 0$,
$A \in \mathbb{Z}^{m \times n}$, to solving $O(nm)$ LPs in $A$ having small integer coefficient
objectives and right-hand sides using any exact LP algorithm. This gives rise to an LP algorithm
in time poly$(n,m\log\Delta_A)$, where $\Delta_A$ is the largest subdeterminant of $A$. A significant
extension to the real model of computation was given by Vavasis and Ye (Math. Prog. '96), giving a
specialized interior point method that runs in time poly$(n,m,\log\bar\chi_A)$, depending on
Stewart's $\bar{\chi}_A$, a well-studied condition number. In this work, we extend Tardos's original
framework to obtain such a running time dependence. In particular, we replace the exact LP solves
with approximate ones, enabling us to directly leverage the tremendous recent algorithmic progress
for approximate linear programming. More precisely, we show that the fundamental "accuracy" needed
to exactly solve any LP in $A$ is inverse polynomial in $n$ and $\log\bar{\chi}_A$. Plugging in the
recent algorithm of van den Brand (SODA '20), our method computes an optimal primal and dual solution
using ${O}(m n^{\omega+1} \log (n)\log(\bar{\chi}_A+n))$ arithmetic operations, outperforming
the specialized interior point method of Vavasis and Ye and its recent improvement by Dadush et al
(STOC '20). At a technical level, our framework combines together approximate LP solutions to compute
exact ones, making use of constructive proximity theorems -- which bound the distance between solutions
of "nearby" LPs -- to keep the required accuracy low.

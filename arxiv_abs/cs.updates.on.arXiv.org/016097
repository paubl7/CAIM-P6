Gene promoters are the key DNA regulatory elements positioned around the transcription start sites
and are responsible for regulating gene transcription process. Various alignment-based, signal-based
and content-based approaches are reported for the prediction of promoters. However, since all
promoter sequences do not show explicit features, the prediction performance of these techniques
is poor. Therefore, many machine learning and deep learning models have been proposed for promoter
prediction. In this work, we studied methods for vector encoding and promoter classification using
genome sequences of three distinct higher eukaryotes viz. yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae),
A. thaliana (plant) and human (Homo sapiens). We compared one-hot vector encoding method with frequency-based
tokenization (FBT) for data pre-processing on 1-D Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model. We
found that FBT gives a shorter input dimension reducing the training time without affecting the
sensitivity and specificity of classification. We employed the deep learning techniques, mainly
CNN and recurrent neural network with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) and random forest (RF) classifier
for promoter classification at k-mer sizes of 2, 4 and 8. We found CNN to be superior in classification
of promoters from non-promoter sequences (binary classification) as well as species-specific
classification of promoter sequences (multiclass classification). In summary, the contribution
of this work lies in the use of synthetic shuffled negative dataset and frequency-based tokenization
for pre-processing. This study provides a comprehensive and generic framework for classification
tasks in genomic applications and can be extended to various classification problems.

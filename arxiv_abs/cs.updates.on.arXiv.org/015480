Open Source Software (OSS) projects are typically the result of collective efforts performed by
developers with different backgrounds. Although the quality of developers' contributions should
be the only factor influencing the evaluation of the contributions to OSS projects, recent studies
have shown that diversity issues are correlated with the acceptance or rejection of developers'
contributions. This paper assists this emerging state-of-the-art body on diversity research
with the first empirical study that analyzes how developers' perceptible race and ethnicity relates
to the evaluation of the contributions in OSS. We performed a large-scale quantitative study of
OSS projects in GitHub. We extracted the developers' perceptible race and ethnicity from their
names in GitHub using the Name-Prism tool and applied regression modeling of contributions (i.e,
pull requests) data from GHTorrent and GitHub. We observed that among the developers whose perceptible
race and ethnicity was captured by the tool, only 16.56% were perceptible as Non-White developers;
contributions from perceptible White developers have about 6-10% higher odds of being accepted
when compared to contributions from perceptible Non-White developers; and submitters with perceptible
non-white races and ethnicities are more likely to get their pull requests accepted when the integrator
is estimated to be from their same race and ethnicity rather than when the integrator is estimated
to be White. Our initial analysis shows a low number of Non-White developers participating in OSS.
Furthermore, the results from our regression analysis lead us to believe that there may exist differences
between the evaluation of the contributions from different perceptible races and ethnicities.
Thus, our findings reinforce the need for further studies on racial and ethnic diversity in software
engineering to foster healthier OSS communities.

Digitisation is often viewed as beneficial to a user. Where originally people would physically
have to identify to a service, pay for a ticket in cash, or go into a library to access a book, people
can now achieve all of this through a click of a button. While these actions may seem functionally
identical to their analogue counterparts, they come with one important difference. Namely, in
the digital case, a user's actions are automatically recorded. The recording of user's interactions
presents a problem because this information can be used outside the control of the person whom it
concerns. This issue is only exacerbated by the centralisation of these aforementioned services'
authentication mechanisms permitting the collection of even more data. This work aims to motivate
the need and establish the feasibility for the application of a privacy-enhancing digital token
management service to public transit. A proof-of-concept implementation of the Decentralised
Digital Identity Architecture proposed by Goodell and Aste is developed. This implementation
was optimised for the public transport use case. Finally, its performance is tested in a local environment
to better understand the technical challenges and assess such a system's technical feasibility
in a production setting. It was observed that for loads between 1 and 5 requests per second the proof-of-concept
performs within acceptable limits with a maximum median response time of 334 milliseconds. Above
5 requests per second response times drastically increase due to hardware bottlenecks. It was concluded
that the demonstrated throughput and latency shows that the system can feasibly compete with solutions
currently in use. Yet, further work is needed to demonstrate these performance characteristics
in an environment similar to that experienced in production.

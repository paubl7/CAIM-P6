Edge networks provide access to a group of proximate users who may have similar content interests.
Caching popular content at the edge networks leads to lower latencies while reducing the load on
backhaul and core networks with the emergence of high-speed 5G networks. User mobility, preferences,
and content popularity are the dominant dynamic features of the edge networks. Temporal and social
features of content, such as the number of views and likes are applied to estimate the popularity
of content from a global perspective. However, such estimates may not be mapped to an edge network
with particular social and geographic characteristics. In edge networks, machine learning techniques
can be applied to predict content popularity based on user preferences, user mobility based on user
location history, cluster users based on similar content interests, and optimize cache placement
strategies provided a set of constraints and predictions about the state of the network. These applications
of machine learning can help identify relevant content for an edge network to lower latencies and
increase cache hits. This article surveys the application of machine learning techniques for caching
content in edge networks. We survey recent state-of-the-art literature and formulate a comprehensive
taxonomy based on (a) machine learning technique, (b) caching strategy, and edge network. We further
survey supporting concepts for optimal edge caching decisions that require the application of
machine learning. These supporting concepts are social-awareness, popularity prediction, and
community detection in edge networks. A comparative analysis of the state-of-the-art literature
is presented with respect to the parameters identified in the taxonomy. Moreover, we debate research
challenges and future directions for optimal caching decisions and the application of machine
learning towards caching in edge networks.

This work addresses the inverse identification of apparent elastic properties of random heterogeneous
materials using machine learning based on artificial neural networks. The proposed neural network-based
identification method requires the construction of a database from which an artificial neural
network can be trained to learn the nonlinear relationship between the hyperparameters of a prior
stochastic model of the random compliance field and some relevant quantities of interest of an ad
hoc multiscale computational model. An initial database made up with input and target data is first
generated from the computational model, from which a processed database is deduced by conditioning
the input data with respect to the target data using the nonparametric statistics. Two-and three-layer
feedforward artificial neural networks are then trained from each of the initial and processed
databases to construct an algebraic representation of the nonlinear mapping between the hyperparameters
(network outputs) and the quantities of interest (network inputs). The performances of the trained
artificial neural networks are analyzed in terms of mean squared error, linear regression fit and
probability distribution between network outputs and targets for both databases. An ad hoc probabilistic
model of the input random vector is finally proposed in order to take into account uncertainties
on the network input and to perform a robustness analysis of the network output with respect to the
input uncertainties level. The capability of the proposed neural network-based identification
method to efficiently solve the underlying statistical inverse problem is illustrated through
two numerical examples developed within the framework of 2D plane stress linear elasticity, namely
a first validation example on synthetic data obtained through computational simulations and a
second application example on real experimental data obtained through a physical experiment monitored
by digital image correlation on a real heterogeneous biological material (beef cortical bone).

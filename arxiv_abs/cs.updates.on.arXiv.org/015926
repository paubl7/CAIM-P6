We extend the incremental potential contact (IPC) model for contacting elastodynamics to resolve
systems composed of codimensional DOFs in arbitrary combination. This enables a unified, interpenetration-free,
robust, and stable simulation framework that couples codimension-0,1,2, and 3 geometries seamlessly
with frictional contact. Extending IPC to thin structures poses new challenges in computing strain,
modeling thickness and determining collisions. To address these challenges we propose three corresponding
contributions. First, we introduce a C2 constitutive barrier model that directly enforces strain
limiting as an energy potential while preserving rest state. This provides energetically-consistent
strain limiting models (both isotropic and anisotropic) for cloth that enable strict satisfaction
of strain-limit inequalities with direct coupling to both elastodynamics and contact via minimization
of the incremental potential. Second, to capture the geometric thickness of codimensional domains
we extend the IPC model to directly enforce distance offsets. Our treatment imposes a strict guarantee
that mid-surfaces (resp. mid-lines) of shells (resp. rods) will not move closer than applied thickness
values. This enables us to account for thickness in the contact behavior of codimensional structures
and so robustly capture challenging contacting geometries; a number of which, to our knowledge,
have not been simulated before. Third, codimensional models, especially with modeled thickness,
mandate strict accuracy requirements that pose a severe challenge to all existing continuous collision
detection (CCD) methods. To address these limitations we develop a new, efficient, simple-to-implement
additive CCD (ACCD) method that applies conservative advancement to iteratively refine a lower
bound for deforming primitives, converging to time of impact.

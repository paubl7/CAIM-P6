Supernumerary Robotics Device (SRD) is an ideal solution to provide robotic assistance in overhead
manual manipulation. Since two arms are occupied for the overhead task, it is desired to have additional
arms to assist us in achieving other subtasks such as supporting the far end of a long plate and pushing
it upward to fit in the ceiling. In this study, a method that maps human muscle force to SRD for overhead
task assistance is proposed. Our methodology is to utilize redundant DoFs such as the idle muscles
in the leg to control the supporting force of the SRD. A sEMG device is worn on the operator's shank
where muscle signals are measured, parsed, and transmitted to SRD for control. In the control aspect,
we adopted stiffness control in the task space based on torque control at the joint level. We are motivated
by the fact that humans can achieve daily manipulation merely through simple inherent compliance
property in joint driven by muscles. We explore to estimate the force of some particular muscles
in humans and control the SRD to imitate the behaviors of muscle and output supporting forces to accomplish
the subtasks such as overhead supporting. The sEMG signals detected from human muscles are extracted,
filtered, rectified, and parsed to estimate the muscle force. We use this force information as the
intent of the operator for proper overhead supporting force. As one of the well-known compliance
control methods, stiffness control is easy to achieve using a few of straightforward parameters
such as stiffness and equilibrium point. Through tuning the stiffness and equilibrium point, the
supporting force of SRD in task space can be easily controlled. The muscle force estimated by sEMG
is mapped to the desired force in the task space of the SRD. The desired force is transferred into stiffness
or equilibrium point to output the corresponding supporting force.

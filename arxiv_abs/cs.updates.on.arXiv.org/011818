Body measurements, including weight and height, are key indicators of health. Being able to visually
assess body measurements reliably is a step towards increased awareness of overweight and obesity
and is thus important for public health. Nevertheless it is currently not well understood how accurately
humans can assess weight and height from images, and when and how they fail. To bridge this gap, we
start from 1,682 images of persons collected from the Web, each annotated with the true weight and
height, and ask crowd workers to estimate the weight and height for each image. We conduct a faceted
analysis taking into account characteristics of the images as well as the crowd workers assessing
the images, revealing several novel findings: (1) Even after aggregation, the crowd's accuracy
is overall low. (2) We find strong evidence of contraction bias toward a reference value, such that
the weight (height) of light (short) people is overestimated, whereas that of heavy (tall) people
is underestimated. (3) We estimate workers' individual reference values using a Bayesian model,
finding that reference values strongly correlate with workers' own height and weight, indicating
that workers are better at estimating people similar to themselves. (4) The weight of tall people
is underestimated more than that of short people; yet, knowing the height decreases the weight error
only mildly. (5) Accuracy is higher on images of females than of males, but female and male workers
are no different in terms of accuracy. (6) Crowd workers improve over time if given feedback on previous
guesses. Finally, we explore various bias correction models for improving the crowd's accuracy,
but find that this only leads to modest gains. Overall, this work provides important insights on
biases in body measurement estimation as obesity related conditions are on the rise.

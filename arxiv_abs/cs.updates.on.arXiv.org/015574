Given a social network, where each user is associated with a selection cost, the problem of \textsc{Budgeted
Influence Maximization} (\emph{BIM Problem} in short) asks to choose a subset of them (known as
seed users) within an allocated budget whose initial activation leads to the maximum number of influenced
nodes. Existing Studies on this problem do not consider the tag-specific influence probability.
However, in reality, influence probability between two users always depends upon the context (e.g.,
sports, politics, etc.). To address this issue, in this paper we introduce the \textsc{Tag\mbox{-}Based
Budgeted Influence Maximization problem} (\emph{TBIM Problem} in short), where along with the
other inputs, a tag set (each of them is also associated with a selection cost) is given, each edge
of the network has the tag specific influence probability, and here the goal is to select influential
users as well as influential tags within the allocated budget to maximize the influence. Considering
the fact that real-world campaigns targeted in nature, we also study the \textsc{Earned Benefit
Maximization} Problem in tag specific influence probability setting, which formally we call the
\textsc{Tag\mbox{-}Based Earned Benefit Maximization problem} (\emph{TEBM Problem} in short).
For this problem along with the inputs of the TBIM Problem, we are given a subset of the nodes as target
users, and each one of them is associated with a benefit value that can be earned by influencing them.
Considering the fact that different tag has different popularity across the communities of the
same network, we propose three methodologies that work based on \emph{effective marginal influence
gain computation}. The proposed methodologies have been analyzed for their time and space requirements.

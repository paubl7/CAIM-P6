COVID-19 patient triaging with predictive outcome of the patients upon first present to emergency
department (ED) is crucial for improving patient prognosis, as well as better hospital resources
management and cross-infection control. We trained a deep feature fusion model to predict patient
outcomes, where the model inputs were EHR data including demographic information, co-morbidities,
vital signs and laboratory measurements, plus patient's CXR images. The model output was patient
outcomes defined as the most insensitive oxygen therapy required. For patients without CXR images,
we employed Random Forest method for the prediction. Predictive risk scores for COVID-19 severe
outcomes ("CO-RISK" score) were derived from model output and evaluated on the testing dataset,
as well as compared to human performance. The study's dataset (the "MGB COVID Cohort") was constructed
from all patients presenting to the Mass General Brigham (MGB) healthcare system from March 1st
to June 1st, 2020. ED visits with incomplete or erroneous data were excluded. Patients with no test
order for COVID or confirmed negative test results were excluded. Patients under the age of 15 were
also excluded. Finally, electronic health record (EHR) data from a total of 11060 COVID-19 confirmed
or suspected patients were used in this study. Chest X-ray (CXR) images were also collected from
each patient if available. Results show that CO-RISK score achieved area under the Curve (AUC) of
predicting MV/death (i.e. severe outcomes) in 24 hours of 0.95, and 0.92 in 72 hours on the testing
dataset. The model shows superior performance to the commonly used risk scores in ED (CURB-65 and
MEWS). Comparing with physician's decisions, CO-RISK score has demonstrated superior performance
to human in making ICU/floor decisions.

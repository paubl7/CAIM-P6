This study presents a new risk-averse multi-stage stochastic epidemics-ventilator-logistics
compartmental model to address the resource allocation challenges of mitigating COVID-19. This
epidemiological logistics model involves the uncertainty of untested asymptomatic infections
and incorporates short-term human migration. Disease transmission is also forecasted through
a new formulation of transmission rates that evolve over space and time with respect to various non-pharmaceutical
interventions, such as wearing masks, social distancing, and lockdown. The proposed multi-stage
stochastic model overviews different scenarios on the number of asymptomatic individuals while
optimizing the distribution of resources, such as ventilators, to minimize the total expected
number of newly infected and deceased people. The Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) is also incorporated
into the multi-stage mean-risk model to allow for a trade-off between the weighted expected loss
due to the outbreak and the expected risks associated with experiencing disastrous pandemic scenarios.
We apply our multi-stage mean-risk epidemics-ventilator-logistics model to the case of controlling
the COVID-19 in highly-impacted counties of New York and New Jersey. We calibrate, validate, and
test our model using actual infection, population, and migration data. The results indicate that
short-term migration influences the transmission of the disease significantly. The optimal number
of ventilators allocated to each region depends on various factors, including the number of initial
infections, disease transmission rates, initial ICU capacity, the population of a geographical
location, and the availability of ventilator supply. Our data-driven modeling framework can be
adapted to study the disease transmission dynamics and logistics of other similar epidemics and
pandemics.

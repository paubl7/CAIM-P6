Background: Clear language makes communication easier between any two parties. A layman may have
difficulty communicating with a professional due to not understanding the specialized terms common
to the domain. In healthcare, it is rare to find a layman knowledgeable in medical terminology which
can lead to poor understanding of their condition and/or treatment. To bridge this gap, several
professional vocabularies and ontologies have been created to map laymen medical terms to professional
medical terms and vice versa. Objective: Many of the presented vocabularies are built manually
or semi-automatically requiring large investments of time and human effort and consequently the
slow growth of these vocabularies. In this paper, we present an automatic method to enrich laymen's
vocabularies that has the benefit of being able to be applied to vocabularies in any domain. Methods:
Our entirely automatic approach uses machine learning, specifically Global Vectors for Word Embeddings
(GloVe), on a corpus collected from a social media healthcare platform to extend and enhance consumer
health vocabularies (CHV). Our approach further improves the CHV by incorporating synonyms and
hyponyms from the WordNet ontology. The basic GloVe and our novel algorithms incorporating WordNet
were evaluated using two laymen datasets from the National Library of Medicine (NLM), Open-Access
Consumer Health Vocabulary (OAC CHV) and MedlinePlus Healthcare Vocabulary. Results: The results
show that GloVe was able to find new laymen terms with an F-score of 48.44%. Furthermore, our enhanced
GloVe approach outperformed basic GloVe with an average F-score of 61%, a relative improvement
of 25%. Furthermore, the enhanced GloVe showed a statistical significance over the two ground truth
datasets with P<.001.

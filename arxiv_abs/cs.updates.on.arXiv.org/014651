The present study examined 4698 Indian Coronary Artery Disease research publications, as indexed
in Web of Science database during 1990-2019, with a view to understand their growth rate, global
share, citation impact, international collaborative papers, distribution of publications by
broad subjects, productivity and citation profile of top organizations and authors, and preferred
media of communication. The Indian publications registered an annual average growth rate of 11.47%,
global share of 1.14%, international collaborative publications share of 38.89% and its citation
impact averaged to 25.58 citations per paper. Among broad subjects, Cardiovascular System & Cardiology
contributed the largest publications share of 19.14% in Indian coronary artery disease output,
followed by Neurosciences & Neurology (14.94%), Pharmacology & Pharmacy (8.51%), etc. during
1990-2019. Among various organizations and authors contributing to Indian coronary artery disease
research, the top 20 organizations and top 30 authors together contributed 40.70% and 37.29% respectively
as their share of Indian publication output and 38.36% and 33.13% respectively as their share of
Indian citation output during 1990-2019. Among 1222 contributing journals in Indian coronary
artery disease research, the top 30 journals registered 30.80% share during 1990-2019. There is
an urgent need to increase the publication output, improve research quality and improve international
collaboration. Indian government also needs to come up with a policy for identification, screening,
diagnosis and treatment of coronary artery disease patients, besides curriculum reform in teaching,
capacity building, patient education and political support are badly needed.

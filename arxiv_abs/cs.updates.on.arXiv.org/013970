Recent technological advancements have enabled proliferated use of small embedded and IoT devices
for collecting, processing, and transferring the security-critical information and user data.
This exponential use has acted as a catalyst in the recent growth of sophisticated attacks such as
the replay, man-in-the-middle, and malicious code modification to slink, leak, tweak or exploit
the security-critical information in malevolent activities. Therefore, secure communication
and software state assurance (at run-time and boot-time) of the device has emerged as open security
problems. Furthermore, these devices need to have an appropriate recovery mechanism to bring them
back to the known-good operational state. Previous researchers have demonstrated independent
methods for attack detection and safeguard. However, the majority of them lack in providing onboard
system recovery and secure communication techniques. To bridge this gap, this manuscript proposes
SRACARE- a framework that utilizes the custom lightweight, secure communication protocol that
performs remote/local attestation, and secure boot with an onboard resilience recovery mechanism
to protect the devices from the above-mentioned attacks. The prototype employs an efficient lightweight,
low-power 32-bit RISC-V processor, secure communication protocol, code authentication, and
resilience engine running on the Artix 7 Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) board. This work presents
the performance evaluation and state-of-the-art comparison results, which shows promising resilience
to attacks and demonstrate the novel protection mechanism with onboard recovery. The framework
achieves these with only 8 % performance overhead and a very small increase in hardware-software
footprint.

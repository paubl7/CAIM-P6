Random walk, as a representation depicting discrete-time unbiased Markov process, has attracted
increasing attention in the past. The most important in studying random walk on networks is to measure
a structural parameter called mean first-passage time, denote by $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$.
As known, the commonly-utilized methods for determining $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ are mainly
based on Laplacian spectra on networks under consideration. On the other hand, methods of this type
can become prohibitively complicated and even fail to work in the worst case where the corresponding
Laplacian matrix is difficult to describe in the first place. In this paper, we will propose an effective
approach to addressing this kind of issues on some tree networks, such as, Vicsek fractal, with intriguing
structural properties, for instance, fractal feature. As opposed to most of previous work focusing
on estimating $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ on growth trees that share deterministic structure,
our goal is to consider stochastic cases where probability is introduced into the process of growing
trees. To this end, we first build up a general formula between Wiener index, denoted by $\mathcal{W}$,
and $\overline{\mathcal{F}}$ on a tree. This enables us to convert issues to answer into calculation
of $\mathcal{W}$ on networks in question, which helps us gain what we are seeking for. Additionally,
it is straightforward to obtain Kirchhoff index on our tree networks using the approach proposed
instead of spectral technique. As an immediate consequence, the previously published results
in deterministic cases are easily covered by formulae established in this paper. Most importantly,
our approach is more manageable than many other methods including spectral technique in situations
considered herein.

Social media play a key role in shaping citizens' political opinion. According to the Eurobarometer,
the percentage of EU citizens employing online social networks on a daily basis has increased from
18% in 2010 to 48% in 2019. The entwinement between social media and the unfolding of political dynamics
has motivated the interest of researchers for the analysis of users online behavior - with particular
emphasis on group polarization during debates and echo-chambers formation. In this context, attention
has been predominantly directed towards the study of online relations between users while semantic
aspects have remained under-explored. In the present paper, we aim at filling this gap by adopting
a two-steps approach. First, we identify the discursive communities animating the political debate
in the run up of the 2018 Italian Elections as groups of users with a significantly-similar retweeting
behavior. Second, we study the semantic mechanisms that shape their internal discussions by monitoring,
on a daily basis, the structural evolution of the semantic networks they induce. Above and beyond
specifying the semantic peculiarities of the Italian electoral competition, our approach innovates
studies of online political discussions in two main ways. On the one hand, it grounds semantic analysis
within users' behaviors by implementing a method, rooted in statistical theory, that guarantees
that our inference of socio-semantic structures is not biased by any unsupported assumption about
missing information; on the other, it is completely automated as it does not rest upon any manual
labelling (either based on the users' features or on their sharing patterns). These elements make
our method applicable to any Twitter discussion regardless of the language or the topic addressed.

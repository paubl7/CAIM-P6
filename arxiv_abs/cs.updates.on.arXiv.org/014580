Background and Objectives: Substitution-box (s-box) is one of the essential components to create
confusion and nonlinear properties in cryptography. To strengthening a cipher against various
attacks, including side channel attacks, these boxes need to have numerous security properties.
In this paper, a novel method to generate s-boxes is introduced aimed at improving the resistance
of s-boxes against side channel attacks. Methods: In the preprocessing phase of this approach,
a suitable initial s-box which has some basic security properties is generated by adopting a fast
algorithm. Then, in the main stage, using the initial s-box, we generate new s-boxes which not only
have the properties of the initial S-box but also have been significantly improved under another
set of security properties. To do this, new s-boxes are generated using a genetic algorithm on a particular
subset of the linear combination set of coordinate functions of the initial s-box in the preprocessing
stage. Results: The performed experiments demonstrate that the values of all security properties
of these new s-boxes, especially the measures of transparency order, signal-to-noise ratio, confusion
coefficient, bijection property, fixed point, and opposite fixed points, have been substantially
improved. For example, our experiments indicate that 70, 220, 2071, 43, and 406 s-boxes are found
better than the initial s-box, respectively, in the dimensions of 4x4 through 8x8 Conclusion: In
this article, a new s-box construction method is introduced in which the properties related to side
channel attacks are improved, without reducing other security properties. Besides, some results
obtained from generated s-boxes in the dimensions of 4x4 through 8x8 demonstrated that the generated
s-boxes are not only improved relative to the initial s-box, but in some cases, considerably better
than some well-known s-boxes.

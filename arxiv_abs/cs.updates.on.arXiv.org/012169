Weakly supervised temporal action localization is a newly emerging yet widely studied topic in
recent years. The existing methods can be categorized into two localization-by-classification
pipelines, i.e., the pre-classification pipeline and the post-classification pipeline. The
pre-classification pipeline first performs classification on each video snippet and then aggregate
the snippet-level classification scores to obtain the video-level classification score. In contrast,
the post-classification pipeline aggregates the snippet-level features first and then predicts
the video-level classification score based on the aggregated feature. Although the classifiers
in these two pipelines are used in different ways, the role they play is exactly the same---to classify
the given features to identify the corresponding action categories. To this end, an ideal classifier
can make both pipelines work. This inspires us to simultaneously learn these two pipelines in a unified
framework to obtain an effective classifier. Specifically, in the proposed learning framework,
we implement two parallel network streams to model the two localization-by-classification pipelines
simultaneously and make the two network streams share the same classifier. This achieves the novel
Equivalent Classification Mapping (ECM) mechanism. Moreover, we discover that an ideal classifier
may possess two characteristics: 1) The frame-level classification scores obtained from the pre-classification
stream and the feature aggregation weights in the post-classification stream should be consistent;
2) The classification results of these two streams should be identical. Based on these two characteristics,
we further introduce a weight-transition module and an equivalent training strategy into the proposed
learning framework, which assists to thoroughly mine the equivalence mechanism.

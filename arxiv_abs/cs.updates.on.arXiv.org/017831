Electronic Medical Records contain clinical narrative text that is of great potential value to
medical researchers. However, this information is mixed with Personally Identifiable Information
that presents risks to patient and clinician confidentiality. This paper presents an end-to-end
de-identification framework to automatically remove PII from hospital discharge summaries.
Our corpus included 600 hospital discharge summaries which were extracted from the EMRs of two principal
referral hospitals in Sydney, Australia. Our end-to-end de-identification framework consists
of three components: 1) Annotation: labelling of PII in the hospital discharge summaries using
five pre-defined categories: person, address, date of birth, individual identification number,
phone/fax number; 2) Modelling: training six named entity recognition deep learning base-models
on balanced and imbalanced datasets; and evaluating ensembles that combine all six base-models,
the three base-models with the best F1 scores and the three base-models with the best recall scores
respectively, using token-level majority voting and stacking methods; and 3) De-identification:
removing PII from the hospital discharge summaries. Our results showed that the ensemble model
combined using the stacking Support Vector Machine method on the three base-models with the best
F1 scores achieved excellent results with a F1 score of 99.16% on the test set of our corpus. We also
evaluated the robustness of our modelling component on the 2014 i2b2 de-identification dataset.
Our ensemble model, which uses the token-level majority voting method on all six base-models, achieved
the highest F1 score of 96.24% at strict entity matching and the highest F1 score of 98.64% at binary
token-level matching compared to two state-of-the-art methods. The end-to-end framework provides
a robust solution to de-identifying clinical narrative corpuses safely.

In this paper, a comprehensive performance analysis of a distributed intelligent reflective surfaces
(IRSs)-aided communication system is presented. First, the optimal signal-to-noise ratio (SNR),
which is attainable through the direct and reflected channels, is quantified by controlling the
phase shifts of the distributed IRS. Next, this optimal SNR is statistically characterized by deriving
tight approximations to the exact probability density function (PDF) and cumulative distribution
function (CDF) for Nakagami-$m$ fading. The accuracy/tightness of this statistical characterization
is investigated by deriving the Kullback-Leibler divergence. Our PDF/CDF analysis is used to derive
tight approximations/bounds for the outage probability, achievable rate, and average symbol
error rate (SER) in closed-form. To obtain useful insights, the asymptotic outage probability
and average SER are derived for the high SNR regime. Thereby, the achievable diversity order and
array gains are quantified. Our asymptotic performance analysis reveals that the diversity order
can be boosted by using distributed passive IRSs without generating additional electromagnetic
(EM) waves via active radio frequency chains. Our asymptotic rate analysis shows that the lower
and upper rate bounds converge to an asymptotic limit in large reflective element regime. Our analysis
is validated via Monte-Carlo simulations. We present a rigorous set of numerical results to investigate
the performance gains of the proposed system model. Our analytical and numerical results reveal
that the performance of single-input single-output wireless systems can be boosted by recycling
the EM waves generated by a transmitter through distributed passive IRS reflections to enable constructive
signal combining at a receiver.

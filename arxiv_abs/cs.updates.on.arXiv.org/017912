Climate change is an existential threat to the United States and the world. Inevitably, computing
will play a key role in mitigation, adaptation, and resilience in response to this threat. The needs
span all areas of computing, from devices and architectures (e.g., low-power sensor systems for
wildfire monitoring) to algorithms (e.g., predicting impacts and evaluating mitigation), and
robotics (e.g., autonomous UAVs for monitoring and actuation) -- as well as every level of the software
stack, from data management systems and energy-aware operating systems to hardware/software
co-design. The goal of this white paper is to highlight the role of computing research in addressing
climate change-induced challenges. To that end, we outline six key impact areas in which these challenges
will arise -- energy, environmental justice, transportation, infrastructure, agriculture,
and environmental monitoring and forecasting -- then identify specific ways in which computing
research can help address the associated problems. These impact areas will create a driving force
behind, and enable, cross-cutting, system-level innovation. We further break down this information
into four broad areas of computing research: devices & architectures, software, algorithms/AI/robotics,
and sociotechnical computing. Additional contributions by: Ilkay Altintas (San Diego Supercomputer

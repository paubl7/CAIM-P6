During the normal operation of a Cloud solution, no one pays attention to the logs except the system
reliability engineers, who may periodically check them to ensure that the Cloud platform's performance
conforms to the Service Level Agreements (SLA). However, the moment a component fails, or a customer
complains about a breach of SLA, the importance of logs increases significantly. All departments,
including management, customer support, and even the actual customer, may turn to logs to determine
the cause and timeline of the issue and to find the party responsible for the issue. The party at fault
may be motivated to tamper with the logs to hide their role. Given the number and volume of logs generated
by the Cloud platforms, many tampering opportunities exist. We argue that the critical nature of
logs calls for immutability and verification mechanism without the presence of a single trusted
party. This paper proposes such a mechanism by describing a blockchain-based log system, called
Logchain, which can be integrated with existing private and public blockchain solutions. Logchain
uses the immutability feature of blockchain to provide a tamper-resistance storage platform for
log storage. Additionally, we propose a hierarchical structure to combine the hash-binding of
two blockchains to address blockchains' scalability issues. To validate the mechanism, we integrate
Logchain into two different types of blockchains. We choose Ethereum as a public, permission-less
blockchain and IBM Blockchain as a private, permission-based one. We show that the solution is scalable
on both the private and public blockchains. Additionally, we perform the analysis of the cost of
ownership for private and public blockchains implementations to help a reader selecting an implementation
that would be applicable to their needs.

Conventional planar video streaming is the most popular application in mobile systems and the rapid
growth of 360 video content and virtual reality (VR) devices are accelerating the adoption of VR
video streaming. Unfortunately, video streaming consumes significant system energy due to the
high power consumption of the system components (e.g., DRAM, display interfaces, and display panel)
involved in this process. We propose BurstLink, a novel system-level technique that improves the
energy efficiency of planar and VR video streaming. BurstLink is based on two key ideas. First, BurstLink
directly transfers a decoded video frame from the host system to the display panel, bypassing the
host DRAM. To this end, we extend the display panel with a double remote frame buffer (DRFB), instead
of the DRAM's double frame buffer, so that the system can directly update the DRFB with a new frame
while updating the panel's pixels with the current frame stored in the DRFB. Second, BurstLink transfers
a complete decoded frame to the display panel in a single burst, using the maximum bandwidth of modern
display interfaces. Unlike conventional systems where the frame transfer rate is limited by the
pixel-update throughput of the display panel, BurstLink can always take full advantage of the high
bandwidth of modern display interfaces by decoupling the frame transfer from the pixel update as
enabled by the DRFB. This direct and burst frame transfer of BurstLink significantly reduces energy
consumption in video display by reducing access to the host DRAM and increasing the system's residency
at idle power states. We evaluate BurstLink using an analytical power model that we rigorously validate
on a real modern mobile system. Our evaluation shows that BurstLink reduces system energy consumption
for 4K planar and VR video streaming by 41% and 33%, respectively.

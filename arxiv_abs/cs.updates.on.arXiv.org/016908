Subscription services face a difficult problem when estimating the causal impact of content launches
on acquisition. Customers buy subscriptions, not individual pieces of content, and once subscribed
they may consume many pieces of content in addition to the one(s) that drew them to the service. In
this paper, we propose a scalable methodology to estimate the incremental acquisition impact of
content launches in a subscription business model when randomized experimentation is not feasible.
Our approach uses simple assumptions to transform the problem into an equivalent question: what
is the expected consumption rate for new subscribers who did not join due to the content launch? We
estimate this counterfactual rate using the consumption rate of new subscribers who joined just
prior to launch, while making adjustments for variation related to subscriber attributes, the
in-product experience, and seasonality. We then compare our counterfactual consumption to the
actual rate in order to back out an acquisition estimate. Our methodology provides top-line impact
estimates at the content / day / region grain. Additionally, to enable subscriber-level attribution,
we present an algorithm that assigns specific individual accounts to add up to the top-line estimate.
Subscriber-level attribution is derived by solving an optimization problem to minimize the number
of subscribers attributed to more than one piece of content, while maximizing the average propensity
to be incremental for subscribers attributed to each piece of content. Finally, in the absence of
definitive ground truth, we present several validation methods which can be used to assess the plausibility
of impact estimates generated by these methods.

Identifying potential threats concealed within the baggage is of prime concern for the security
staff. Many researchers have developed frameworks that can detect baggage threats from X-ray scans.
However, to the best of our knowledge, all of these frameworks require extensive training on large-scale
and well-annotated datasets, which are hard to procure in the real world. This paper presents a novel
unsupervised anomaly instance segmentation framework that recognizes baggage threats, in X-ray
scans, as anomalies without requiring any ground truth labels. Furthermore, thanks to its stylization
capacity, the framework is trained only once, and at the inference stage, it detects and extracts
contraband items regardless of their scanner specifications. Our one-staged approach initially
learns to reconstruct normal baggage content via an encoder-decoder network utilizing a proposed
stylization loss function. The model subsequently identifies the abnormal regions by analyzing
the disparities within the original and the reconstructed scans. The anomalous regions are then
clustered and post-processed to fit a bounding box for their localization. In addition, an optional
classifier can also be appended with the proposed framework to recognize the categories of these
extracted anomalies. A thorough evaluation of the proposed system on four public baggage X-ray
datasets, without any re-training, demonstrates that it achieves competitive performance as
compared to the conventional fully supervised methods (i.e., the mean average precision score
of 0.7941 on SIXray, 0.8591 on GDXray, 0.7483 on OPIXray, and 0.5439 on COMPASS-XP dataset) while
outperforming state-of-the-art semi-supervised and unsupervised baggage threat detection
frameworks by 67.37%, 32.32%, 47.19%, and 45.81% in terms of F1 score across SIXray, GDXray, OPIXray,
and COMPASS-XP datasets, respectively.

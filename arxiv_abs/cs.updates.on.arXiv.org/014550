Clinical coding is the task of assigning a set of alphanumeric codes, referred to as ICD (International
Classification of Diseases), to a medical event based on the context captured in a clinical narrative.
The latest version of ICD, ICD-10, includes more than 70,000 codes. As this is a labor-intensive
and error-prone task, automatic ICD coding of medical reports using machine learning has gained
significant interest in the last decade. Existing literature has modeled this problem as a multi-label
task. Nevertheless, such multi-label approach is challenging due to the extremely large label
set size. Furthermore, the interpretability of the predictions is essential for the endusers (e.g.,
healthcare providers and insurance companies). In this paper, we propose a novel approach for automatic
ICD coding by reformulating the extreme multi-label problem into a simpler multi-class problem
using a hierarchical solution. We made this approach viable through extensive data collection
to acquire phrase-level human coder annotations to supervise our models on learning the specific
relations between the input text and predicted ICD codes. Our approach employs two independently
trained networks, the sentence tagger and the ICD classifier, stacked hierarchically to predict
a codeset for a medical report. The sentence tagger identifies focus sentences containing a medical
event or concept relevant to an ICD coding. Using a supervised attention mechanism, the ICD classifier
then assigns each focus sentence with an ICD code. The proposed approach outperforms strong baselines
by large margins of 23% in subset accuracy, 18% in micro-F1, and 15% in instance based F-1. With our
proposed approach, interpretability is achieved not through implicitly learned attention scores
but by attributing each prediction to a particular sentence and words selected by human coders.

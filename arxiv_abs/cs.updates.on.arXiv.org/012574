This paper describes and develops a fast and accurate algorithm that computes the field of values
boundary curve for every conceivable complex square matrix $A$, i.e., for all matrices, those with
or without repeated eigenvalues and with or without Jordan block structures, with ill-conditioned
eigenvalues or ill-conditioned ones and so forth. It relies on a matrix flow decomposition method
that finds a block-diagonal flow representation for the hermitean matrix flow $H\!K_A(t) = \cos(t)
H + \sin(t) K$ if this is possible. Here $H\!K_A(t)$ is a 1-parameter varying linear combination
of the real and skew part matrices $H = (A+A^*)/2$ and $K = (A-A^*)/(2i)$ of $A$. For decomposing flows
$H\!K_A(t)$, the algorithm decomposes the given dense general matrix $A$ unitarily into $U^*AU
= \text { diag} (A_j)$ with diagonal blocks $A_j$ that conform in size with those of $H\!K_A$. It then
computes the field of values boundaries separately for each diagonal block $A_j$ using the path
following ZNN eigenvalue method. The convex hull of all sub field of values boundary points then
determines the field of values boundary curve correctly for decomposing and non-decomposing matrices
$A$. The algorithm removes standard restrictions for path following FoV methods that generally
cannot deal with decomposing matrices $A$ due to possible eigencurve crossings of $H\!K_A(t)$.
Tests and numerical comparisons are included. Our ZNN based method is coded for sequential and parallel
computations and both versions run very accurately and very fast when compared with Johnson's global
QR eigenvalue and Bedixon rectangle based method that computes complete eigenanalyses of $H\!K_A(t_k)$
for every chosen $t_k \in {[} 0,2\pi{]}$ .

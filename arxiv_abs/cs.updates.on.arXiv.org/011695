Objective: Medical relations are the core components of medical knowledge graphs that are needed
for healthcare artificial intelligence. However, the requirement of expert annotation by conventional
algorithm development processes creates a major bottleneck for mining new relations. In this paper,
we present Hi-RES, a framework for high-throughput relation extraction algorithm development.
We also show that combining knowledge articles with electronic health records (EHRs) significantly
increases the classification accuracy. Methods: We use relation triplets obtained from structured
databases and semistructured webpages to label sentences from target corpora as positive training
samples. Two methods are also provided for creating improved negative samples by combining positive
samples with na\"ive negative samples. We propose a common model that summarizes sentence information
using large-scale pretrained language models and multi-instance attention, which then joins
with the concept embeddings trained from the EHRs for relation prediction. Results: We apply the
Hi-RES framework to develop classification algorithms for disorder-disorder relations and disorder-location
relations. Millions of sentences are created as training data. Using pretrained language models
and EHR-based embeddings individually provides considerable accuracy increases over those of
previous models. Joining them together further tremendously increases the accuracy to 0.947 and
0.998 for the two sets of relations, respectively, which are 10-17 percentage points higher than
those of previous models. Conclusion: Hi-RES is an efficient framework for achieving high-throughput
and accurate relation extraction algorithm development.

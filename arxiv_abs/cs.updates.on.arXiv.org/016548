Any data analysis, especially the data sets that may be changing often or in real-time, consists
of at least three important synchronized components: i) figuring out what to infer (objectives),
ii) analysis or computation of objectives, and iii) understanding of the results which may require
drill-down and/or visualization. There is a lot of attention paid to the first two of the above components
as part of research whereas the understanding as well as deriving actionable decisions is quite
tricky. Visualization is an important step towards both understanding (even by non-experts) and
inferring the actions that need to be taken. As an example, for Covid-19, knowing regions (say, at
the county or state level) that have seen a spike or prone to a spike in cases in the near future may warrant
additional actions with respect to gatherings, business opening hours, etc. This paper focuses
on an extensible architecture for visualization of base as well as analyzed data. This paper proposes
a modular architecture of a dashboard for user-interaction, visualization management, and complex
analysis of base data. The contributions of this paper are: i) extensibility of the architecture
providing flexibility to add additional analysis, visualizations, and user interactions without
changing the workflow, ii) decoupling of the functional modules to ease and speedup development
by different groups, and iii) address efficiency issues for display response time. This paper uses
Multilayer Networks (or MLNs) for analysis. To showcase the above, we present the implementation
of a visualization dashboard, termed CoWiz++ (for Covid Wizard), and elaborate on how web-based
user interaction and display components are interfaced seamlessly with the back end modules.

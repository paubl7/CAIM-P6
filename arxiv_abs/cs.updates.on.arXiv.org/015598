Accurately predicting the behavior of a nuclear reactor requires multiphysics simulation of coupled
neutronics, thermal-hydraulics and fuel thermo-mechanics. The fuel thermo-mechanical response
provides essential information for operational limits and safety analysis. Traditionally, fuel
performance analysis is performed standalone, using calculated spatial-temporal power distribution
and thermal boundary conditions from the coupled neutronics-thermal-hydraulics simulation
as input. Such one-way coupling is result of the high cost induced by the full-core fuel performance
analysis, which provides more realistic and accurate prediction of the core-wide response than
the "peak rod" analysis. It is therefore desirable to improve the computational efficiency of full-core
fuel performance modeling by constructing fast-running surrogate, such that fuel performance
modeling can be utilized in the core reload design optimization. This work presents methodologies
for full-core surrogate construction based on several realistic equilibrium PWR core designs.
As a fast and conventional approach, look-up tables are only effective for certain fuel performance
quantities of interest (QoIs). Several representative machine-learning algorithms are introduced
to capture the complicated physics for other fuel performance QoIs. Rule-based model is useful
as a feature extraction technique to account for the spatial-temporal complexity of operating
conditions. Constructed surrogates achieve at least ten thousand time acceleration with satisfying
prediction accuracy. Current work lays foundation for tighter coupling of fuel performance modeling
into the core design optimization framework. It also sets stage for full-core fuel performance
analysis with BISON where the computational cost becomes more burdensome.

Optimisation and simulation models for the design and operation of grid-connected distributed
energy systems (DES) often exclude the inherent nonlinearities related to power flow and generation
and storage units, to maintain an accuracy-complexity balance. Such models may provide sub-optimal
or even infeasible designs and dispatch schedules. In DES, optimal power flow (OPF) is often misrepresented
and treated as a standalone problem. OPF consists of highly nonlinear and nonconvex constraints
related to the underlying alternating current (AC) distribution network. This aspect of the optimisation
problem has often been overlooked by researchers in the process systems and optimisation area.
In this review we address the disparity between OPF and DES models, highlighting the importance
of including elements of OPF in DES design and operational models to ensure that the design and operation
of microgrids meet the requirements of the electrical grid. By analysing foundational models for
both DES and OPF, we identify detailed technical power flow constraints that have been typically
represented using oversimplified linear approximations in DES models. We also identify a subset
of models, labelled DES-OPF, which include these detailed constraints and use innovative optimisation
approaches to solve them. Results of these studies suggest that achieving feasible solutions with
high-fidelity models is more important than achieving globally optimal solutions using less-detailed
DES models. Recommendations for future work include the need for more comparisons between high-fidelity
models and models with linear approximations, and the use of simulation tools to validate DES-OPF
models. The review is aimed at a multidisciplinary audience of researchers and stakeholders who
are interested in modelling DES to support the development of more robust and accurate optimisation
models for the future.

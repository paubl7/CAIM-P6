Over the last few decades, Lung Ultrasound (LUS) has been increasingly used to diagnose and monitor
different lung diseases in neonates. It is a non invasive tool that allows a fast bedside examination
while minimally handling the neonate. Acquiring a LUS scan is easy, but understanding the artifacts
concerned with each respiratory disease is challenging. Mixed artifact patterns found in different
respiratory diseases may limit LUS readability by the operator. While machine learning (ML), especially
deep learning can assist in automated analysis, simply feeding the ultrasound images to an ML model
for diagnosis is not enough to earn the trust of medical professionals. The algorithm should output
LUS features that are familiar to the operator instead. Therefore, in this paper we present a unique
approach for extracting seven meaningful LUS features that can be easily associated with a specific
pathological lung condition: Normal pleura, irregular pleura, thick pleura, Alines, Coalescent
B-lines, Separate B-lines and Consolidations. These artifacts can lead to early prediction of
infants developing later respiratory distress symptoms. A single multi-class region proposal-based
object detection model faster-RCNN (fRCNN) was trained on lower posterior lung ultrasound videos
to detect these LUS features which are further linked to four common neonatal diseases. Our results
show that fRCNN surpasses single stage models such as RetinaNet and can successfully detect the
aforementioned LUS features with a mean average precision of 86.4%. Instead of a fully automatic
diagnosis from images without any interpretability, detection of such LUS features leave the ultimate
control of diagnosis to the clinician, which can result in a more trustworthy intelligent system.

Purpose: Microservice Architecture (MSA) denotes an increasingly popular architectural style
in which business capabilities are wrapped into autonomously developable and deployable software
components called microservices. Microservice applications are developed by multiple DevOps
teams each owning one or more services. In this article, we explore the state of how DevOps teams in
small and medium-sized organizations (SMOs) cope with MSA and how they can be supported. Methods:
We show through a secondary analysis of an exploratory interview study comprising six cases, that
the organizational and technological complexity resulting from MSA poses particular challenges
for small and medium-sized organizations (SMOs). We apply Model-Driven Engineering to address
these challenges. Results: As results of the second analysis, we identify the challenge areas of
building and maintaining a common architectural understanding, and dealing with deployment technologies.
To support DevOps teams of SMOs in coping with these challenges, we present a model-driven workflow
based on LEMMA - the Language Ecosystem for Modeling Microservice Architecture. To implement the
workflow, we extend LEMMA with the functionality to (i) generate models from API documentation;
(ii) reference remote models owned by other teams; (iii) generate deployment specifications;
and (iv) generate a visual representation of the overall architecture. Conclusion: We validate
the model-driven workflow and our extensions to LEMMA through a case study showing that the added
functionality to LEMMA can bring efficiency gains for DevOps teams. To develop best practices for
applying our workflow to maximize efficiency in SMOs, we plan to conduct more empirical research
in the field in the future.

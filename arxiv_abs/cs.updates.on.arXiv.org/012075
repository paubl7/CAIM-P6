The connectivity aspect of connected autonomous vehicles (CAV) is beneficial because it facilitates
dissemination of traffic-related information to vehicles through Vehicle-to-External (V2X)
communication. Onboard sensing equipment including LiDAR and camera can reasonably characterize
the traffic environment in the immediate locality of the CAV. However, their performance is limited
by their sensor range (SR). On the other hand, longer-range information is helpful for characterizing
imminent conditions downstream. By contemporaneously coalescing the short- and long-range information,
the CAV can construct comprehensively its surrounding environment and thereby facilitate informed,
safe, and effective movement planning in the short-term (local decisions including lane change)
and long-term (route choice). In this paper, we describe a Deep Reinforcement Learning based approach
that integrates the data collected through sensing and connectivity capabilities from other vehicles
located in the proximity of the CAV and from those located further downstream, and we use the fused
data to guide lane changing, a specific context of CAV operations. In addition, recognizing the
importance of the connectivity range (CR) to the performance of not only the algorithm but also of
the vehicle in the actual driving environment, the paper carried out a case study. The case study
demonstrates the application of the proposed algorithm and duly identifies the appropriate CR
for each level of prevailing traffic density. It is expected that implementation of the algorithm
in CAVs can enhance the safety and mobility associated with CAV driving operations. From a general
perspective, its implementation can provide guidance to connectivity equipment manufacturers
and CAV operators, regarding the default CR settings for CAVs or the recommended CR setting in a given
traffic environment.

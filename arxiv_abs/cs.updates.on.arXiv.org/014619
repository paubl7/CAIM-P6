Ontology-Based Data Access (OBDA) has traditionally focused on providing a unified view of heterogeneous
datasets, either by materializing integrated data into RDF or by performing on-the fly querying
via SPARQL query translation. In the specific case of tabular datasets represented as several CSV
or Excel files, query translation approaches have been applied by considering each source as a single
table that can be loaded into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Nevertheless, constraints
over these tables are not represented; thus, neither consistency among attributes nor indexes
over tables are enforced. As a consequence, efficiency of the SPARQL-to-SQL translation process
may be affected, as well as the completeness of the answers produced during the evaluation of the
generated SQL query. Our work is focused on applying implicit constraints on the OBDA query translation
process over tabular data. We propose Morph-CSV, a framework for querying tabular data that exploits
information from typical OBDA inputs (e.g., mappings, queries) to enforce constraints that can
be used together with any SPARQL-to-SQL OBDA engine. Morph-CSV relies on both a constraint component
and a set of constraint operators. For a given set of constraints, the operators are applied to each
type of constraint with the aim of enhancing query completeness and performance. We evaluate Morph-CSV
in several domains: e-commerce with the BSBM benchmark; transportation with a benchmark using
the GTFS dataset from the Madrid subway; and biology with a use case extracted from the Bio2RDF project.
We compare and report the performance of two SPARQL-to-SQL OBDA engines, without and with the incorporation
of MorphCSV. The observed results suggest that Morph-CSV is able to speed up the total query execution
time by up to two orders of magnitude, while it is able to produce all the query answers.

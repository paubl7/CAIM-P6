Cloud computing is a convenient model for processing data remotely. However, users must trust their
cloud provider with the confidentiality and integrity of the stored and processed data. To increase
the protection of virtual machines, AMD introduced SEV, a hardware feature which aims to protect
code and data in a virtual machine. This allows to store and process sensitive data in cloud environments
without the need to trust the cloud provider or the underlying software. However, the virtual machine
still depends on the hypervisor for performing certain activities, such as the emulation of special
CPU instructions, or the emulation of devices. Yet, most code that runs in virtual machines was not
written with an attacker model which considers the hypervisor as malicious. In this work, we introduce
a new class of attacks in which a malicious hypervisor manipulates external interfaces of an SEV
or SEV-ES virtual machine to make it act against its own interests. We start by showing how we can make
use of virtual devices to extract encryption keys and secret data of a virtual machine. We then show
how we can reduce the entropy of probabilistic kernel defenses in the virtual machine by carefully
manipulating the results of the CPUID and RDTSC instructions. We continue by showing an approach
for secret data exfiltration and code injection based on the forgery of MMIO regions over the VM's
address space. Finally, we show another attack which forces decryption of the VM's stack and uses
Return Oriented Programming to execute arbitrary code inside the VM. While our approach is also
applicable to traditional virtualization environments, its severity significantly increases
with the attacker model of SEV-ES, which aims to protect a virtual machine from a benign but vulnerable
hypervisor.

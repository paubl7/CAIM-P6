Identification of 3D cephalometric landmarks that serve as proxy to the shape of human skull is the
fundamental step in cephalometric analysis. Since manual landmarking from 3D computed tomography
(CT) images is a cumbersome task even for the trained experts, automatic 3D landmark detection system
is in a great need. Recently, automatic landmarking of 2D cephalograms using deep learning (DL)
has achieved great success, but 3D landmarking for more than 80 landmarks has not yet reached a satisfactory
level, because of the factors hindering machine learning such as the high dimensionality of the
input data and limited amount of training data due to ethical restrictions on the use of medical data.
This paper presents a semi-supervised DL method for 3D landmarking that takes advantage of anonymized
landmark dataset with paired CT data being removed. The proposed method first detects a small number
of easy-to-find reference landmarks, then uses them to provide a rough estimation of the entire
landmarks by utilizing the low dimensional representation learned by variational autoencoder
(VAE). Anonymized landmark dataset is used for training the VAE. Finally, coarse-to-fine detection
is applied to the small bounding box provided by rough estimation, using separate strategies suitable
for mandible and cranium. For mandibular landmarks, patch-based 3D CNN is applied to the segmented
image of the mandible (separated from the maxilla), in order to capture 3D morphological features
of mandible associated with the landmarks. We detect 6 landmarks around the condyle all at once,
instead of one by one, because they are closely related to each other. For cranial landmarks, we again
use VAE-based latent representation for more accurate annotation. In our experiment, the proposed
method achieved an averaged 3D point-to-point error of 2.91 mm for 90 landmarks only with 15 paired
training data.

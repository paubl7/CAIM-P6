Recapturing attack can be employed as a simple but effective anti-forensic tool for digital document
images. Inspired by the document inspection process that compares a questioned document against
a reference sample, we proposed a document recapture detection scheme by employing Siamese network
to compare and extract distinct features in a recapture document image. The proposed algorithm
takes advantages of both metric learning and image forensic techniques. Instead of adopting Euclidean
distance-based loss function, we integrate the forensic similarity function with a triplet loss
and a normalized softmax loss. After training with the proposed triplet selection strategy, the
resulting feature embedding clusters the genuine samples near the reference while pushes the recaptured
samples apart. In the experiment, we consider practical domain generalization problems, such
as the variations in printing/imaging devices, substrates, recapturing channels, and document
types. To evaluate the robustness of different approaches, we benchmark some popular off-the-shelf
machine learning-based approaches, a state-of-the-art document image detection scheme, and
the proposed schemes with different network backbones under various experimental protocols.
Experimental results show that the proposed schemes with different network backbones have consistently
outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches under different experimental settings. Specifically,
under the most challenging scenario in our experiment, i.e., evaluation across different types
of documents that produced by different devices, we have achieved less than 5.00% APCER (Attack
Presentation Classification Error Rate) and 5.56% BPCER (Bona Fide Presentation Classification
Error Rate) by the proposed network with ResNeXt101 backbone at 5% BPCER decision threshold.

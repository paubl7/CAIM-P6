Caches have been used to construct various types of covert and side channels to leak information.
Most of the previous cache channels exploit the timing difference between cache hits and cache misses.
However, we introduce a new and broader classification of cache covert channel attacks: Hit+Miss,
Hit+Hit, Miss+Miss. We highlight that cache misses (or cache hits) in different states may have
more significant time differences, which can be used as timing channels. Based on the classification,
We propose a new type of stable and stealthy Miss+Miss cache channel. The write-back caches are widely
deployed in modern processors. This paper presents in detail how to use replacement latency difference
to construct timing-based channels (calles WB channel) to leak information in the write-back cache:
any modification to a cache line by a sender will set the cache line to the dirty state, and the receiver
can observe this through measuring the latency to replace this cache set. We also demonstrate how
senders could exploit a different number of dirty cache lines in a cache set to improve transmission
bandwidth with symbols encoding multiple bits. The peak transmission bandwidths of the WB channels
in commercial systems can vary between 1300 to 4400 Kbps per cache set in the hyper-threaded setting
without shared memory between the sender and the receiver. Different from most existing cache channels
that always target specific memory addresses, the new WB channels focus on the cache set and cache
line states, making the channel hard to be disturbed by other processes on the core and can still work
in the cache using a random replacement policy. We also analyzed the stealthiness of WB channels
from the perspective of the number of cache loads and cache miss rates. Further, This paper discusses
and evaluates possible defenses. The paper finishes by discussing various forms of side-channel
attacks.

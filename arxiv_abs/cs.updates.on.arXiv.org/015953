We introduce a new problem which we call the Pony Express problem. n robots with differing speeds
are situated over some domain. A message is placed at some commonly known point. Robots can acquire
the message either by visiting its initial position, or by encountering another robot that has already
acquired it. The robots must collaborate to deliver the message to a given destination. The objective
is to deliver the message in minimum time. In this paper we study the Pony Express problem on the line
where n robots are arbitrarily deployed along a finite segment. The robots have different speeds
and can move in both directions. We are interested in both offline centralized and online distributed
algorithms. In the online case, we assume the robots have limited knowledge of the initial configuration.
In particular, the robots do not know the initial positions and speeds of the other robots nor even
their own position and speed. They do, however, know the direction on the line in which to find the
message and have the ability to compare speeds when they meet. First, we study the Pony Express problem
where the message is initially placed at one endpoint of a segment and must be delivered to the other
endpoint. We provide an O(n log n) running time offline algorithm as well as an optimal online algorithm.
Then we study the Half-Broadcast problem where the message is at the center and must be delivered
to either one of the endpoints of the segment [-1,1]. We provide an offline algorithm running in O(n^2
log n) time and we provide an online algorithm that attains a competitive ratio of 3/2 which we show
is the best possible. Finally, we study the Broadcast problem where the message is at the center and
must be delivered to both endpoints of the segment [-1,1]. Here we give an FPTAS in the offline case
and an online algorithm that attains a competitive ratio of 9/5, which we show is tight.

Given the critical role played by natural gas in providing electricity, heat, and other essential
services, better models are needed to understand the dynamics of natural gas networks during extreme
events. This paper aims at establishing appropriate and fast simulation models to capture the slow
dynamics of linepack depletion for ideal isothermal natural gas pipeline networks. Instead of
solving partial differential equations (PDE) on a large scale, three alternative implicit ordinary
differential equation (ODE) simulation techniques are derived and discussed. The first one is
commonly used in the literature with a slack node assumption. We show that the system of equations
associated with this model is degenerate when flux injections are controlled (i.e. specified)
at all nodes. To recover regularity under such a condition, two novel implicit ODE models are proposed,
both with different techniques for specifying boundary conditions. They are easy to derive and
efficient to simulate with standard ODE solvers. More importantly, they present useful frameworks
for analyzing how networks respond to system-wide mass flux imbalances. These techniques offer
different alternatives for simulating system dynamics based on how sources and loads are chosen
to be modeled, and they are all proven to be regular (non-degenerate) in tree-structured networks.
These proposed techniques are all tested on the 20-node Belgium network. The simulation results
show that the conventional model with the slack node assumption cannot effectively capture linepack
depletion under long term system-wide mass flux imbalance, while the proposed models can characterize
the network behavior until the linepack is completely depleted.

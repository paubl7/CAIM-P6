Computer-aided diagnosis has become a necessity for accurate and immediate coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) detection to aid treatment and prevent the spread of the virus. Compared to other
diagnosis methodologies, chest X-ray (CXR) imaging is an advantageous tool since it is fast, low-cost,
and easily accessible. Thus, CXR has a great potential not only to help diagnose COVID-19 but also
to track the progression of the disease. Numerous studies have proposed to use Deep Learning techniques
for COVID-19 diagnosis. However, they have used very limited CXR image repositories for evaluation
with a small number, a few hundreds, of COVID-19 samples. Moreover, these methods can neither localize
nor grade the severity of COVID-19 infection. For this purpose, recent studies proposed to explore
the activation maps of deep networks. However, they remain inaccurate for localizing the actual
infestation making them unreliable for clinical use. This study proposes a novel method for the
joint localization, severity grading, and detection of COVID-19 from CXR images by generating
the so-called infection maps that can accurately localize and grade the severity of COVID-19 infection.
To accomplish this, we have compiled the largest COVID-19 dataset up to date with 2951 COVID-19 CXR
images, where the annotation of the ground-truth segmentation masks is performed on CXRs by a novel
collaborative expert human-machine approach. Furthermore, we publicly release the first CXR
dataset with the ground-truth segmentation masks of the COVID-19 infected regions. A detailed
set of experiments show that state-of-the-art segmentation networks can learn to localize COVID-19
infection with an F1-score of 85.81%, that is significantly superior to the activation maps created
by the previous methods. Finally, the proposed approach achieved a COVID-19 detection performance
with 98.37% sensitivity and 99.16% specificity.

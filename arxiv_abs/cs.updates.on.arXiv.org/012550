Quantum computing will change the way we tackle certain problems. It promises to dramatically speed-up
many chemical, financial, and machine-learning applications. However, to capitalize on those
promises, complex design flows composed of steps such as compilation, decomposition, or mapping
need to be employed before being able to execute a conceptual quantum algorithm on an actual device.
This results in descriptions at various levels of abstraction which may significantly differ from
each other. The complexity of the underlying design problems necessitates to not only provide efficient
solutions for the single steps, but also to verify that the originally intended functionality is
preserved throughout all levels of abstraction. This motivates methods for equivalence checking
of quantum circuits. However, most existing methods are inspired by the classical realm and have
merely been extended to support quantum circuits (i.e., circuits which do not only rely on 0's and
1's, but also employ superposition and entanglement). In this work, we propose an advanced methodology
which takes the different paradigms of quantum circuits not only as a burden, but as an opportunity.
In fact, the proposed methodology explicitly utilizes characteristics unique to quantum computing
in order to overcome the shortcomings of existing approaches. We show that, by exploiting the reversibility
of quantum circuits, complexity can be kept feasible in many cases. Moreover, we show that, in contrast
to the classical realm, simulation is very powerful in verifying quantum circuits. Experimental
evaluations confirm that the resulting methodology allows one to conduct equivalence checking
dramatically faster than ever before--in many cases just a single simulation run is sufficient.
An implementation of the proposed methodology is publicly available at https://iic.jku.at/eda/research/quantum_verification/.

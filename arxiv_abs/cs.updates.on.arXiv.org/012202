Current brain white matter fiber tracking techniques show a number of problems, including: generating
large proportions of streamlines that do not accurately describe the underlying anatomy; extracting
streamlines that are not supported by the underlying diffusion signal; and under-representing
some fiber populations, among others. In this paper, we describe a novel unsupervised learning
method to filter streamlines from diffusion MRI tractography, and hence, to obtain more reliable
tractograms. We show that a convolutional neural network autoencoder provides a straightforward
and elegant way to learn a robust representation of brain streamlines, which can be used to filter
undesired samples with a nearest neighbor algorithm. Our method, dubbed FINTA (Filtering in Tractography
using Autoencoders) comes with several key advantages: training does not need labeled data, as
it uses raw tractograms, it is fast and easily reproducible, it does not rely on the input diffusion
MRI data, and thus, does not suffer from domain adaptation issues. We demonstrate the ability of
FINTA to discriminate between "plausible" and "implausible" streamlines as well as to recover
individual streamline group instances from a raw tractogram, from both synthetic and real human
brain diffusion MRI tractography data, including partial tractograms. Results reveal that FINTA
has a superior filtering performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Together, this work
brings forward a new deep learning framework in tractography based on autoencoders, and shows how
it can be applied for filtering purposes. It sets the foundations for opening up new prospects towards
more accurate and robust tractometry and connectivity diffusion MRI analyses, which may ultimately
lead to improve the imaging of the white matter anatomy.

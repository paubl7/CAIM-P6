One of the obstacles hindering the scaling-up of the initial successes of machine learning in practical
engineering applications is the dependence of the accuracy on the size of the database that "drives"
the algorithms. Incorporating the already-known physical laws into the training process can significantly
reduce the size of the required database. In this study, we establish a neural network-based computational
framework to characterize the finite deformation of elastic plates, which in classic theories
is described by the F\"oppl--von K\'arm\'an (FvK) equations with a set of boundary conditions (BCs).
A neural network is constructed by taking the spatial coordinates as the input and the displacement
field as the output to approximate the exact solution of the FvK equations. The physical information
(PDEs, BCs, and potential energies) is then incorporated into the loss function, and a pseudo dataset
is sampled without knowing the exact solution to finally train the neural network. The prediction
accuracy of the modeling framework is carefully examined by applying it to four different loading
cases: in-plane tension with non-uniformly distributed stretching forces, in-plane central-hole
tension, out-of-plane deflection, and buckling under compression. \hl{Three ways of formulating
the loss function are compared: 1) purely data-driven, 2) PDE-based, and 3) energy-based. Through
the comparison with the finite element simulations, it is found that all the three approaches can
characterize the elastic deformation of plates with a satisfactory accuracy if trained properly.
Compared with incorporating the PDEs and BCs in the loss, using the total potential energy shows
certain advantage in terms of the simplicity of hyperparameter tuning and the computational efficiency.

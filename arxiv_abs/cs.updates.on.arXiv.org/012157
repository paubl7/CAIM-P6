The recent outbreak of SARS COV-2 gave us a unique opportunity to study for a non interventional and
sustainable AI solution. Lung disease remains a major healthcare challenge with high morbidity
and mortality worldwide. The predominant lung disease was lung cancer. Until recently, the world
has witnessed the global pandemic of COVID19, the Novel coronavirus outbreak. We have experienced
how viral infection of lung and heart claimed thousands of lives worldwide. With the unprecedented
advancement of Artificial Intelligence in recent years, Machine learning can be used to easily
detect and classify medical imagery. It is much faster and most of the time more accurate than human
radiologists. Once implemented, it is more cost-effective and time-saving. In our study, we evaluated
the efficacy of Microsoft Cognitive Service to detect and classify COVID19 induced pneumonia from
other Viral/Bacterial pneumonia based on X-Ray and CT images. We wanted to assess the implication
and accuracy of the Automated ML-based Rapid Application Development (RAD) environment in the
field of Medical Image diagnosis. This study will better equip us to respond with an ML-based diagnostic
Decision Support System(DSS) for a Pandemic situation like COVID19. After optimization, the trained
network achieved 96.8% Average Precision which was implemented as a Web Application for consumption.
However, the same trained network did not perform the same like Web Application when ported to Smartphone
for Real-time inference. Which was our main interest of study. The authors believe, there is scope
for further study on this issue. One of the main goal of this study was to develop and evaluate the performance
of AI-powered Smartphone-based Real-time Application. Facilitating primary diagnostic services
in less equipped and understaffed rural healthcare centers of the world with unreliable internet
service.

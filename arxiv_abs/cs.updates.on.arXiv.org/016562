We propose a novel framework for verifiable and compositional reinforcement learning (RL) in which
a collection of RL sub-systems, each of which learns to accomplish a separate sub-task, are composed
to achieve an overall task. The framework consists of a high-level model, represented as a parametric
Markov decision process (pMDP) which is used to plan and to analyze compositions of sub-systems,
and of the collection of low-level sub-systems themselves. By defining interfaces between the
sub-systems, the framework enables automatic decompositons of task specifications, e.g., reach
a target set of states with a probability of at least 0.95, into individual sub-task specifications,
i.e. achieve the sub-system's exit conditions with at least some minimum probability, given that
its entry conditions are met. This in turn allows for the independent training and testing of the
sub-systems; if they each learn a policy satisfying the appropriate sub-task specification, then
their composition is guaranteed to satisfy the overall task specification. Conversely, if the
sub-task specifications cannot all be satisfied by the learned policies, we present a method, formulated
as the problem of finding an optimal set of parameters in the pMDP, to automatically update the sub-task
specifications to account for the observed shortcomings. The result is an iterative procedure
for defining sub-task specifications, and for training the sub-systems to meet them. As an additional
benefit, this procedure allows for particularly challenging or important components of an overall
task to be determined automatically, and focused on, during training. Experimental results demonstrate
the presented framework's novel capabilities.

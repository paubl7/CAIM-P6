Mobile network is evolving from a communication-only network towards the one with joint communication
and radio/radar sensing (JCAS) capabilities, that we call perceptive mobile network (PMN). Radio
sensing here refers to information retrieval from received mobile signals for objects of interest
in the environment surrounding the radio transceivers. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive
survey for systems and technologies that enable JCAS in PMN, with a focus on works in the last ten years.
Starting with reviewing the work on coexisting communication and radar systems, we highlight their
limits on addressing the interference problem, and then introduce the JCAS technology. We then
set up JCAS in the mobile network context, and envisage its potential applications. We continue
to provide a brief review for three types of JCAS systems, with particular attention to their differences
on the design philosophy. We then introduce a framework of PMN, including the system platform and
infrastructure, three types of sensing operations, and signals usable for sensing, and discuss
required system modifications to enable sensing on current communication-only infrastructure.
Within the context of PMN, we review stimulating research problems and potential solutions, organized
under eight topics: mutual information, waveform optimization, antenna array design, clutter
suppression, sensing parameter estimation, pattern analysis, networked sensing under cellular
topology, and sensing-assisted secure communication. This paper provides a comprehensive picture
for the motivation, methodology, challenges, and research opportunities of realizing PMN. The
PMN is expected to provide a ubiquitous radio sensing platform and enable a vast number of novel smart
applications.

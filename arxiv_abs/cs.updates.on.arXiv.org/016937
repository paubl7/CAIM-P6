The Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW) is a combinatorial optimization problem where
the goal is to maximize the total score collected from different visited locations. The application
of neural network models to combinatorial optimization has recently shown promising results in
dealing with similar problems, like the Travelling Salesman Problem. A neural network allows learning
solutions using reinforcement learning or supervised learning, depending on the available data.
After the learning stage, it can be generalized and quickly fine-tuned to further improve performance
and personalization. The advantages are evident since, for real-world applications, solution
quality, personalization, and execution times are all important factors that should be taken into
account. This study explores the use of Pointer Network models trained using reinforcement learning
to solve the OPTW problem. We propose a modified architecture that leverages Pointer Networks to
better address problems related with dynamic time-dependent constraints. Among its various applications,
the OPTW can be used to model the Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP). We train the Pointer Network
with the TTDP problem in mind, by sampling variables that can change across tourists visiting a particular
instance-region: starting position, starting time, available time, and the scores given to each
point of interest. Once a model-region is trained, it can infer a solution for a particular tourist
using beam search. We based the assessment of our approach on several existing benchmark OPTW instances.
We show that it generalizes across different tourists that visit each region and that it generally
outperforms the most commonly used heuristic, while computing the solution in realistic times.

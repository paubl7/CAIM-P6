Hawkes processes are a popular means of modeling the event times of self-exciting phenomena, such
as earthquake strikes or tweets on a topical subject. Classically, these models are fit to historical
event time data via likelihood maximization. However, in many scenarios, the exact times of historical
events are not recorded for either privacy (e.g., patient admittance to hospitals) or technical
limitations (e.g., most transport data records the volume of vehicles passing loop detectors but
not the individual times). The interval-censored setting denotes when only the aggregate counts
of events at specific time intervals are observed. Fitting the parameters of interval-censored
Hawkes processes requires designing new training objectives that do not rely on the exact event
times. In this paper, we propose a model to estimate the parameters of a Hawkes process in interval-censored
settings. Our model builds upon the existing Hawkes Intensity Process (HIP) of in several important
directions. First, we observe that while HIP is formulated in terms of expected intensities, it
is more natural to work instead with expected counts; further, one can express the latter as the solution
to an integral equation closely related to the defining equation of HIP. Second, we show how a non-homogeneous
Poisson approximation to the Hawkes process admits a tractable likelihood in the interval-censored
setting; this approximation recovers the original HIP objective as a special case, and allows for
the use of a broader class of Bregman divergences as loss function. Third, we explicate how to compute
a tighter approximation to the ground truth in the likelihood. Finally, we show how our model can
incorporate information about varying interval lengths. Experiments on synthetic and real-world
data confirm our HIPPer model outperforms HIP and several other baselines on the task of interval-censored
inference.

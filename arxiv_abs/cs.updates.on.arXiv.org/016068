A widely used standard for portable multilingual data analysis pipelines would enable considerable
benefits to scholarly publication reuse, research/industry collaboration, regulatory cost
control, and to the environment. Published research that used multiple computer languages for
their analysis pipelines would include a complete and reusable description of that analysis that
is runnable on a diverse set of computing environments. Researchers would be able to easier collaborate
and reuse these pipelines, adding or exchanging components regardless of programming language
used; collaborations with and within the industry would be easier; approval of new medical interventions
that rely on such pipelines would be faster. Time will be saved and environmental impact would also
be reduced, as these descriptions contain enough information for advanced optimization without
user intervention. Workflows are widely used in data analysis pipelines, enabling innovation
and decision-making for the modern society. In many domains the analysis components are numerous
and written in multiple different computer languages by third parties. However, lacking a standard
for reusable and portable multilingual workflows, then reusing published multilingual workflows,
collaborating on open problems, and optimizing their execution would be severely hampered. Moreover,
only a standard for multilingual data analysis pipelines that was widely used would enable considerable
benefits to research-industry collaboration, regulatory cost control, and to preserving the
environment. Prior to the start of the CWL project, there was no standard for describing multilingual
analysis pipelines in a portable and reusable manner. Even today / currently, although there exist
hundreds of single-vendor and other single-source systems that run workflows, none is a general,
community-driven, and consensus-built standard.

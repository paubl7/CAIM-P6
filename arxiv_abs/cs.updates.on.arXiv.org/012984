Crew Pairing Optimization aims at generating a set of flight sequences (crew pairings), covering
all flights in an airline's flight schedule, at minimum cost, while satisfying several legality
constraints. CPO is critically important for airlines' business viability, considering that
the crew operating cost is their second-largest expense. It poses an NP-hard combinatorial optimization
problem, to tackle which, the state-of-the-art relies on relaxing the underlying Integer Programming
Problem (IPP) into a Linear Programming Problem (LPP), solving the latter through Column Generation
(CG) technique, and integerization of the resulting LPP solution. However, with the growing scale
and complexity of the flight networks (those with a large number of flights, multiple crew bases
and/or multiple hub-and-spoke subnetworks), the utility of the conventional CG-practices has
become questionable. This paper proposed an Airline Crew Pairing Optimization Framework, AirCROP,
whose constitutive modules include the Legal Crew Pairing Generator, Initial Feasible Solution
Generator, and an Optimization Engine built on heuristic-based CG-implementation. In this paper,
besides the design of AirCROP's modules, insights into important questions related to how these
modules interact, which the literature is otherwise silent on, have been shared. These relate to
the sensitivity of AirCROP's performance towards: sources of variability over multiple runs for
a given problem, initialization method, and termination parameters for LPP-solutioning and IPP-solutioning.
The efficacy of the AirCROP has been demonstrated on real-world large-scale and complex flight
networks (with over 4200 flights, 15 crew bases, and billion-plus pairings). It is hoped that with
the emergence of such complex flight networks, this paper shall serve as an important milestone
for affiliated research and applications.

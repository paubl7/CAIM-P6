As access to space and robotic autonomy capabilities move forward, there is simultaneously a growing
interest in deploying large, complex space structures to provide new on-orbit capabilities. New
space-borne observatories, large orbital outposts, and even futuristic on-orbit manufacturing
will be enabled by robotic assembly of space structures using techniques like on-orbit additive
manufacturing which can provide flexibility in constructing and even repairing complex hardware.
However, the dynamics underlying the robotic assembler during manipulation may operate under
inertial uncertainties. Thus, inertial estimation of the robot and the manipulated component
system must be considered during structural assembly. The contribution of this work is to address
both the motion planning and control for robotic assembly with consideration of the inertial estimation
of the combined free-flying robotic assembler and additively manufactured component system.
Specifically, the Linear Quadratic Regulator Rapidly-Exploring Randomized Trees (LQR-RRT*)
and dynamically feasible path smoothing are used to obtain obstacle-free trajectories for the
system. Further, model learning is incorporated explicitly into the planning stages via approximation
of the continuous system and accompanying reward of performing safe, objective-oriented motion.
Remaining uncertainty can then be dealt with using robust tube model predictive control. By obtaining
controlled trajectories that consider both obstacle avoidance and learning of the inertial properties
of the free-flyer and manipulated component system, the free-flyer rapidly considers and plans
the construction of space structures with enhanced system knowledge. The approach naturally generalizes
to repairing, refueling, and re-provisioning space structure components while providing optimal
collision-free trajectories under e.g., inertial uncertainty.

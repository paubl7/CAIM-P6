The segmentation of prostate whole gland and transition zone in Diffusion Weighted MRI (DWI) are
the first step in designing computer-aided detection algorithms for prostate cancer. However,
variations in MRI acquisition parameters and scanner manufacturing result in different appearances
of prostate tissue in the images. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which have shown to be successful
in various medical image analysis tasks including segmentation are typically sensitive to the
variations in imaging parameters. This sensitivity leads to poor segmentation performance of
CNNs trained on a source cohort and tested on a target cohort from a different scanner and hence, it
limits the applicability of CNNs for cross-cohort training and testing. Contouring prostate whole
gland and transition zone in DWI images are time-consuming and expensive. Thus, it is important
to enable CNNs pretrained on images of source domain, to segment images of target domain with minimum
requirement for manual segmentation of images from the target domain. In this work, we propose a
transfer learning method based on a modified U-net architecture and loss function, for segmentation
of prostate whole gland and transition zone in DWIs using a CNN pretrained on a source dataset and
tested on the target dataset. We explore the effect of the size of subset of target dataset used for
fine-tuning the pre-trained CNN on the overall segmentation accuracy. Our results show that with
a fine-tuning data as few as 30 patients from the target domain, the proposed transfer learning-based
algorithm can reach dice score coefficient of 0.80 for both prostate whole gland and transition
zone segmentation. Using a fine-tuning data of 115 patients from the target domain, dice score coefficient
of 0.85 and 0.84 are achieved for segmentation of whole gland and transition zone, respectively,
in the target domain.

The Internet of Things (IoT) requires a new processing paradigm that inherits the scalability of
the cloud while minimizing network latency using resources closer to the network edge. Building
up such flexibility within the edge-to-cloud continuum consisting of a distributed networked
ecosystem of heterogeneous computing resources is challenging. Furthermore, IoT traffic dynamics
and the rising demand for low-latency services foster the need for minimizing the response time
and balanced service placement. Load-balancing for fog computing becomes a cornerstone for cost-effective
system management and operations. This paper studies two optimization objectives and formulates
a decentralized load-balancing problem for IoT service placement: (global) IoT workload balance
and (local) quality of service (QoS), in terms of minimizing the cost of deadline violation, service
deployment, and unhosted services. The proposed solution, EPOS Fog, introduces a decentralized
multi-agent system for collective learning that utilizes edge-to-cloud nodes to jointly balance
the input workload across the network and minimize the costs involved in service execution. The
agents locally generate possible assignments of requests to resources and then cooperatively
select an assignment such that their combination maximizes edge utilization while minimizes service
execution cost. Extensive experimental evaluation with realistic Google cluster workloads on
various networks demonstrates the superior performance of EPOS Fog in terms of workload balance
and QoS, compared to approaches such as First Fit and exclusively Cloud-based. The results confirm
that EPOS Fog reduces service execution delay up to 25% and the load-balance of network nodes up to
90%. The findings also demonstrate how distributed computational resources on the edge can be utilized
more cost-effectively by harvesting collective intelligence.

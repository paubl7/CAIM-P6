Proximity tracing apps have been proposed as an aide in dealing with the COVID-19 crisis. Some of
those apps leverage attenuation of Bluetooth beacons from mobile devices to build a record of proximate
encounters between a pair of device owners. The underlying protocols are known to suffer from false
positive and re-identification attacks. We present evidence that the attacker's difficulty in
mounting such attacks has been overestimated. Indeed, an attacker leveraging a moderately successful
app or SDK with Bluetooth and location access can eavesdrop and interfere with these proximity tracing
systems at no hardware cost and perform these attacks against users who do not have this app or SDK
installed. We describe concrete examples of actors who would be in a good position to execute such
attacks. We further present a novel attack, which we call a biosurveillance attack, which allows
the attacker to monitor the exposure risk of a smartphone user who installs their app or SDK but who
does not use any contact tracing system and may falsely believe that they have opted out of the system.
Through traffic auditing with an instrumented testbed, we characterize precisely the behaviour
of one such SDK that we found in a handful of apps---but installed on more than one hundred million
mobile devices. Its behaviour is functionally indistinguishable from a re-identification or
biosurveillance attack and capable of executing a false positive attack with minimal effort. We
also discuss how easily an attacker could acquire a position conducive to such attacks, by leveraging
the lax logic for granting permissions to apps in the Android framework: any app with some geolocation
permission could acquire the necessary Bluetooth permission through an upgrade, without any additional
user prompt. Finally we discuss motives for conducting such attacks.

In this paper, the private authentication problem is considered that consists of a certificate
authority, a verifier (or verifiers), many legitimate users (prover) and arbitrary number of attackers.
Each legitimate user wants to be authenticated (using his personal key) by the verifier(s), while
simultaneously staying anonymous. However, an attacker must fail to be authenticated. We analyze
this problem from an information theoretical perspective. First, we propose a general interactive
information-theoretic model. As a metric to measure reliability, we consider the key rate whose
rate maximization has a trade-off with establishing privacy. We consider the problem in two different
setups: single server and multi-server scenarios. In single server scenario one verifier is considered,
which all the provers connected to. In multi-server scenario, $n$ verifiers are assumed, where
each verifier is connected to a subset of users. For both scenarios, two regimes are considered:
finite size and asymptotic regimes. In single server scenario, for both regimes, we propose schemes
that satisfy completeness, soundness and privacy properties. Moreover, we show that our scheme
achieves capacity in the asymptotic regime. For finite size regime our scheme achieves capacity
for large field size. In multi-server scenario two methods are considered: individual and distributed
authentication. In individual authentication, the process of authentication is done by one single
verifier. In this case, for both regimes, we propose schemes that satisfy completeness, soundness
and privacy properties. In distributed authentication, the process of authentication is done
collaboratively by all the verifiers. For this case, when all the provers are connected to all the
verifiers, we propose an optimal scheme in finite size regime.

Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensors are becoming increasingly ubiquitous in everyday devices
such as smartphones, fitness watches, etc. As a result, the array of health-related applications
that tap onto this data has been growing, as well as the importance of designing accurate prediction
models for tasks such as human activity recognition (HAR). However, one important task that has
received little attention is the prediction of an individual's heart rate when undergoing a physical
activity using IMU data. This could be used, for example, to determine which activities are safe
for a person without having him/her actually perform them. We propose a neural architecture for
this task composed of convolutional and LSTM layers, similarly to the state-of-the-art techniques
for the closely related task of HAR. However, our model includes a convolutional network that extracts,
based on sensor data from a previously executed activity, a physical conditioning embedding (PCE)
of the individual to be used as the LSTM's initial hidden state. We evaluate the proposed model, dubbed
PCE-LSTM, when predicting the heart rate of 23 subjects performing a variety of physical activities
from IMU-sensor data available in public datasets (PAMAP2, PPG-DaLiA). For comparison, we use
as baselines the only model specifically proposed for this task, and an adapted state-of-the-art
model for HAR. PCE-LSTM yields over 10% lower mean absolute error. We demonstrate empirically that
this error reduction is in part due to the use of the PCE. Last, we use the two datasets (PPG-DaLiA,
WESAD) to show that PCE-LSTM can also be successfully applied when photoplethysmography (PPG)
sensors are available to rectify heart rate measurement errors caused by movement, outperforming
the state-of-the-art deep learning baselines by more than 30%.

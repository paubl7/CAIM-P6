Automatic phenotype concept recognition from unstructured text remains a challenging task in
biomedical text mining research. Previous works that address the task typically use dictionary-based
matching methods, which can achieve high precision but suffer from lower recall. Recently, machine
learning-based methods have been proposed to identify biomedical concepts, which can recognize
more unseen concept synonyms by automatic feature learning. However, most methods require large
corpora of manually annotated data for model training, which is difficult to obtain due to the high
cost of human annotation. In this paper, we propose PhenoTagger, a hybrid method that combines both
dictionary and machine learning-based methods to recognize Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) concepts
in unstructured biomedical text. We first use all concepts and synonyms in HPO to construct a dictionary,
which is then used to automatically build a distantly supervised training dataset for machine learning.
Next, a cutting-edge deep learning model is trained to classify each candidate phrase (n-gram from
input sentence) into a corresponding concept label. Finally, the dictionary and machine learning-based
prediction results are combined for improved performance. Our method is validated with two HPO
corpora, and the results show that PhenoTagger compares favorably to previous methods. In addition,
to demonstrate the generalizability of our method, we retrained PhenoTagger using the disease
ontology MEDIC for disease concept recognition to investigate the effect of training on different
ontologies. Experimental results on the NCBI disease corpus show that PhenoTagger without requiring
manually annotated training data achieves competitive performance as compared with state-of-the-art
supervised methods.

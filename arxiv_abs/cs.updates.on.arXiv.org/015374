Contact tracing is a very effective way to control the COVID-19-like pandemics. It aims to identify
individuals who closely contacted an infected person during the incubation period of the virus
and notify them to quarantine. However, the existing systems suffer from privacy, security, and
efficiency issues. To address these limitations, in this paper, we propose an efficient and privacy-preserving
Blockchain-based infection control system. Instead of depending on a single authority to run the
system, a group of health authorities, that form a consortium Blockchain, run our system. Using
Blockchain technology not only secures our system against single point of failure and denial of
service attacks, but also brings transparency because all transactions can be validated by different
parties. Although contact tracing is important, it is not enough to effectively control an infection.
Thus, unlike most of the existing systems that focus only on contact tracing, our system consists
of three integrated subsystems, including contact tracing, public places access control, and
safe-places recommendation. The access control subsystem prevents infected people from visiting
public places to prevent spreading the virus, and the recommendation subsystem categorizes zones
based on the infection level so that people can avoid visiting contaminated zones. Our analysis
demonstrates that our system is secure and preserves the privacy of the users against identification,
social graph disclosure, and tracking attacks, while thwarting false reporting (or panic) attacks.
Moreover, our extensive performance evaluations demonstrate the scalability of our system (which
is desirable in pandemics) due to its low communication, computation, and storage overheads.

Large scale eCommerce platforms such as eBay carry a wide variety of inventory and provide several
buying choices to online shoppers. It is critical for eCommerce search engines to showcase in the
top results the variety and selection of inventory available, specifically in the context of the
various buying intents that may be associated with a search query. Search rankers are most commonly
powered by learning-to-rank models which learn the preference between items during training.
However, they score items independent of other items at runtime. Although the items placed at top
of the results by such scoring functions may be independently optimal, they can be sub-optimal as
a set. This may lead to a mismatch between the ideal distribution of items in the top results vs what
is actually impressed. In this paper, we present methods to address the purchase-impression gap
observed in top search results on eCommerce sites. We establish the ideal distribution of items
based on historic shopping patterns. We then present a sequential reranker that methodically reranks
top search results produced by a conventional pointwise scoring ranker. The reranker produces
a reordered list by sequentially selecting candidates trading off between their independent relevance
and potential to address the purchase-impression gap by utilizing specially constructed features
that capture impression distribution of items already added to a reranked list. The sequential
reranker enables addressing purchase impression gap with respect to multiple item aspects. Early
version of the reranker showed promising lifts in conversion and engagement metrics at eBay. Based
on experiments on randomly sampled validation datasets, we observe that the reranking methodology
presented produces around 10% reduction in purchase-impression gap at an average for the top 20
results, while making improvements to conversion metrics.

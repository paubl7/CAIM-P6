In stable coronary artery disease (CAD), reduction in mortality and/or myocardial infarction
with revascularization over medical therapy has not been reliably achieved. Coronary arteries
are usually extracted to perform stenosis detection. We aim to develop an automatic algorithm by
deep learning to extract coronary arteries from ICAs.In this study, a multi-input and multi-scale
(MIMS) U-Net with a two-stage recurrent training strategy was proposed for the automatic vessel
segmentation. Incorporating features such as the Inception residual module with depth-wise separable
convolutional layers, the proposed model generated a refined prediction map with the following
two training stages: (i) Stage I coarsely segmented the major coronary arteries from pre-processed
single-channel ICAs and generated the probability map of vessels; (ii) during the Stage II, a three-channel
image consisting of the original preprocessed image, a generated probability map, and an edge-enhanced
image generated from the preprocessed image was fed to the proposed MIMS U-Net to produce the final
segmentation probability map. During the training stage, the probability maps were iteratively
and recurrently updated by feeding into the neural network. After segmentation, an arterial stenosis
detection algorithm was developed to extract vascular centerlines and calculate arterial diameters
to evaluate stenotic level. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved
an average Dice score of 0.8329, an average sensitivity of 0.8281, and an average specificity of
0.9979 in our dataset with 294 ICAs obtained from 73 patient. Moreover, our stenosis detection algorithm
achieved a true positive rate of 0.6668 and a positive predictive value of 0.7043.

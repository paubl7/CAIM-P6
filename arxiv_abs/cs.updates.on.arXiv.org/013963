The need for multiple interactive, real-time simulations using different parameter values has
driven the design of fast numerical algorithms with certifiable accuracies. The reduced basis
method (RBM) presents itself as such an option. RBM features a mathematically rigorous error estimator
which drives the construction of a low-dimensional subspace. A surrogate solution is then sought
in this low-dimensional space approximating the parameter-induced high fidelity solution manifold.
However when the system is nonlinear or its parameter dependence nonaffine, this efficiency gain
degrades tremendously, an inherent drawback of the application of the empirical interpolation
method (EIM). In this paper, we augment and extend the EIM approach as a direct solver, as opposed
to an assistant, for solving nonlinear partial differential equations on the reduced level. The
resulting method, called Reduced Over-Collocation method (ROC), is stable and capable of avoiding
the efficiency degradation. Two critical ingredients of the scheme are collocation at about twice
as many locations as the number of basis elements for the reduced approximation space, and an efficient
error indicator for the strategic building of the reduced solution space. The latter, the main contribution
of this paper, results from an adaptive hyper reduction of the residuals for the reduced solution.
Together, these two ingredients render the proposed R2-ROC scheme both offline- and online-efficient.
A distinctive feature is that the efficiency degradation appearing in traditional RBM approaches
that utilize EIM for nonlinear and nonaffine problems is circumvented, both in the offline and online
stages. Numerical tests on different families of time-dependent and steady-state nonlinear problems
demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy of our R2-ROC and its superior stability performance.

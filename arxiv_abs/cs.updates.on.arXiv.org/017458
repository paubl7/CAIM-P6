The expanding adoption of digital pathology has enabled the curation of large repositories of histology
whole slide images (WSIs), which contain a wealth of information. Similar pathology image search
offers the opportunity to comb through large historical repositories of gigapixel WSIs to identify
cases with similar morphological features and can be particularly useful for diagnosing rare diseases,
identifying similar cases for predicting prognosis, treatment outcomes, and potential clinical
trial success. A critical challenge in developing a WSI search and retrieval system is scalability,
which is uniquely challenging given the need to search a growing number of slides that each can consist
of billions of pixels and are several gigabytes in size. Such systems are typically slow and retrieval
speed often scales with the size of the repository they search through, making their clinical adoption
tedious and are not feasible for repositories that are constantly growing. Here we present Fast
Image Search for Histopathology (FISH), a histology image search pipeline that is infinitely scalable
and achieves constant search speed that is independent of the image database size while being interpretable
and without requiring detailed annotations. FISH uses self-supervised deep learning to encode
meaningful representations from WSIs and a Van Emde Boas tree for fast search, followed by an uncertainty-based
ranking algorithm to retrieve similar WSIs. We evaluated FISH on multiple tasks and datasets with
over 22,000 patient cases spanning 56 disease subtypes. We additionally demonstrate that FISH
can be used to assist with the diagnosis of rare cancer types where sufficient cases may not be available
to train traditional supervised deep models. FISH is available as an easy-to-use, open-source
software package (https://github.com/mahmoodlab/FISH).

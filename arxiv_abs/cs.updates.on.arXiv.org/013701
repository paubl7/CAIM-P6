Because of their highly directional transmissions, radios operating at millimeter wave (mmWave)
frequencies need to perform beam management to establish and maintain reliable mmWave links. Existing
solutions rely on explicit coordination between the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX), which
reduces the airtime available for communication and complicates the network protocol design.
This paper presents DeepBeam, a framework for beam management in mmWave networks that does not require
pilot sequences from the transmitter, nor any beam sweeping or synchronization from the receiver.
This is achieved by inferring (i) the Angle of Arrival (AoA) of the beam and (ii) the actual beam being
used by the transmitter through waveform-level deep learning on ongoing transmissions between
the TX to other receivers. This is possible because different beam patterns introduce different
"impairments" to the waveform, which can be subsequently learned by a convolutional neural network
(CNN). To demonstrate DeepBeam's generality, we conduct an extensive experimental campaign where
we collect more than 4 TB of mmWave waveforms with (i) 4 phased array antennas at 60.48 GHz, (ii) 2 codebooks
containing 24 one-dimensional beams and 12 two-dimensional beams; (iii) 3 receiver gains; (iv)
3 different AoAs; (v) multiple TX and RX locations. We also collect waveform data with two custom-designed
mmWave software-defined radios with fully-digital beamforming architectures at 58 GHz, and implement
our learning models in FPGA to evaluate latency performance. DeepBeam (i) achieves accuracy of
up to 96%, 84% and 77% with a 5-beam, 12-beam and 24-beam codebook, respectively; and (ii) reduces
latency by up to 7x with respect to the 5G NR initial beam sweep in a default configuration and with
a 12-beam codebook. Additionally, we pledge to share our waveform dataset and the full DeepBeam
code repo with the community.

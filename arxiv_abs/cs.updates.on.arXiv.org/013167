In [Van Beeumen, et. al, HPC Asia 2020, https://www.doi.org/10.1145/3368474.3368497] a scalable
and matrix-free eigensolver was proposed for studying the many-body localization (MBL) transition
of two-level quantum spin chain models with nearest-neighbor $XX+YY$ interactions plus $Z$ terms.
This type of problem is computationally challenging because the vector space dimension grows exponentially
with the physical system size, and averaging over different configurations of the random disorder
is needed to obtain relevant statistical behavior. For each eigenvalue problem, eigenvalues from
different regions of the spectrum and their corresponding eigenvectors need to be computed. Traditionally,
the interior eigenstates for a single eigenvalue problem are computed via the shift-and-invert
Lanczos algorithm. Due to the extremely high memory footprint of the LU factorizations, this technique
is not well suited for large number of spins $L$, e.g., one needs thousands of compute nodes on modern
high performance computing infrastructures to go beyond $L = 24$. The matrix-free approach does
not suffer from this memory bottleneck, however, its scalability is limited by a computation and
communication imbalance. We present a few strategies to reduce this imbalance and to significantly
enhance the scalability of the matrix-free eigensolver. To optimize the communication performance,
we leverage the consistent space runtime, CSPACER, and show its efficiency in accelerating the
MBL irregular communication patterns at scale compared to optimized MPI non-blocking two-sided
and one-sided RMA implementation variants. The efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed algorithm
is demonstrated by computing eigenstates on a massively parallel many-core high performance computer.

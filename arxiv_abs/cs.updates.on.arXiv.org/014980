The production of lightweight metal lattice structures has received much attention due to the recent
developments in additive manufacturing (AM). The design flexibility comes, however, with the
complexity of the underlying physics. In fact, metal additive manufacturing introduces process-induced
geometrical defects that mainly result in deviations of the effective geometry from the nominal
one. This change in the final printed shape is the primary cause of the gap between the as-designed
and as-manufactured mechanical behavior of AM products. Thus, the possibility to incorporate
the precise manufactured geometries into the computational analysis is crucial for the quality
and performance assessment of the final parts. Computed tomography (CT) is an accurate method for
the acquisition of the manufactured shape. However, it is often not feasible to integrate the CT-based
geometrical information into the traditional computational analysis due to the complexity of
the meshing procedure for such high-resolution geometrical models and the prohibitive numerical
costs. In this work, an embedded numerical framework is applied to efficiently simulate and compare
the mechanical behavior of as-designed to as-manufactured octet-truss lattice structures. The
parts are produced using laser powder bed fusion (LPBF). Employing an immersed boundary method,
namely the Finite Cell Method (FCM), we perform direct numerical simulations (DNS) and first-order
numerical homogenization analysis of a tensile test for a 3D printed octet-truss structure. Numerical
results based on CT scan (as-manufactured geometry) show an excellent agreement with experimental
measurements, whereas both DNS and first-order numerical homogenization performed directly
on the 3D virtual model (as-designed geometry) of the structure show a significant deviation from
experimental data.

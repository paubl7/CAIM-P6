On-board embedded software developed for spaceflight systems (space software) must adhere to
stringent software quality assurance procedures. For example, verification and validation activities
are typically performed and assessed by third party organizations. To further minimize the risk
of human mistakes, space agencies, such as the European Space Agency (ESA), are looking for automated
solutions for the assessment of software testing activities, which play a crucial role in this context.
Over the years, mutation analysis has shown to be a promising solution for the automated assessment
of test suites; it consists of measuring the quality of a test suite in terms of the percentage of injected
faults leading to a test failure. A number of optimization techniques, addressing scalability
and accuracy problems, have been proposed to facilitate the industrial adoption of mutation analysis.
However, to date, two major problems prevent space agencies from enforcing mutation analysis in
space software development. In this paper, we enhance mutation analysis optimization techniques
to enable their applicability to embedded software and propose a pipeline that successfully integrates
them to address scalability and accuracy issues in this context, as described above. Further, we
report on the largest study involving embedded software systems in the mutation analysis literature.
Our research is part of a research project funded by ESA ESTEC involving private companies (GomSpace
Luxembourg and LuxSpace) in the space sector. These industry partners provided the case studies
reported in this paper; they include an on-board software system managing a microsatellite currently
on-orbit, a set of libraries used in deployed cubesats, and a mathematical library certified by
ESA.

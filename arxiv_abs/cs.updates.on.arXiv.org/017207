The human neuromuscular system consisting of skeletal muscles and neural circuits is a complex
system that is not yet fully understood. Surface electromyography (EMG) can be used to study muscle
behavior from the outside. Computer simulations with detailed biophysical models provide a non-invasive
tool to interpret EMG signals and gain new insights into the system. The numerical solution of such
multi-scale models imposes high computational work loads, which restricts their application
to short simulation time spans or coarse resolutions. We tackled this challenge by providing scalable
software employing instruction-level and task-level parallelism, suitable numerical methods
and efficient data handling. We implemented a comprehensive, state-of-the-art, multi-scale
multi-physics model framework that can simulate surface EMG signals and muscle contraction as
a result of neuromuscular stimulation. This work describes the model framework and its numerical
discretization, develops new algorithms for mesh generation and parallelization, covers the
use and implementation of our software OpenDiHu, and evaluates its computational performance
in numerous use cases. We obtain a speedup of several hundred compared to a baseline solver from the
literature and demonstrate, that our distributed-memory parallelization and the use of High Performance
Computing resources enables us to simulate muscular surface EMG of the biceps brachii muscle with
realistic muscle fiber counts of several hundred thousands. We find that certain model effects
are only visible with such high resolution. In conclusion, our software contributes to more realistic
simulations of the neuromuscular system and provides a tool for applied researchers to complement
in vivo experiments with in-silico studies. It can serve as a building block to set up comprehensive
models for more organs in the musculoskeletal system.

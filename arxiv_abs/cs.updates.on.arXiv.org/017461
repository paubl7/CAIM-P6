In recent years, with the advent of deep-learning, face recognition has achieved exceptional success.
However, many of these deep face recognition models perform much better in handling frontal faces
compared to profile faces. The major reason for poor performance in handling of profile faces is
that it is inherently difficult to learn pose-invariant deep representations that are useful for
profile face recognition. In this paper, we hypothesize that the profile face domain possesses
a latent connection with the frontal face domain in a latent feature subspace. We look to exploit
this latent connection by projecting the profile faces and frontal faces into a common latent subspace
and perform verification or retrieval in the latent domain. We leverage a coupled conditional generative
adversarial network (cpGAN) structure to find the hidden relationship between the profile and
frontal images in a latent common embedding subspace. Specifically, the cpGAN framework consists
of two conditional GAN-based sub-networks, one dedicated to the frontal domain and the other dedicated
to the profile domain. Each sub-network tends to find a projection that maximizes the pair-wise
correlation between the two feature domains in a common embedding feature subspace. The efficacy
of our approach compared with the state-of-the-art is demonstrated using the CFP, CMU Multi-PIE,
IJB-A, and IJB-C datasets. Additionally, we have also implemented a coupled convolutional neural
network (cpCNN) and an adversarial discriminative domain adaptation network (ADDA) for profile
to frontal face recognition. We have evaluated the performance of cpCNN and ADDA and compared it
with the proposed cpGAN. Finally, we have also evaluated our cpGAN for reconstruction of frontal
faces from input profile faces contained in the VGGFace2 dataset.

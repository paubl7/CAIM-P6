Face recognition remains a challenging task in unconstrained scenarios, especially when faces
are partially occluded. To improve the robustness against occlusion, augmenting the training
images with artificial occlusions has been proved as a useful approach. However, these artificial
occlusions are commonly generated by adding a black rectangle or several object templates including
sunglasses, scarfs and phones, which cannot well simulate the realistic occlusions. In this paper,
based on the argument that the occlusion essentially damages a group of neurons, we propose a novel
and elegant occlusion-simulation method via dropping the activations of a group of neurons in some
elaborately selected channel. Specifically, we first employ a spatial regularization to encourage
each feature channel to respond to local and different face regions. In this way, the activations
affected by an occlusion in a local region are more likely to be located in a single feature channel.
Then, the locality-aware channel-wise dropout (LCD) is designed to simulate the occlusion by dropping
out the entire feature channel. Furthermore, by randomly dropping out several feature channels,
our method can well simulate the occlusion of larger area. The proposed LCD can encourage its succeeding
layers to minimize the intra-class feature variance caused by occlusions, thus leading to improved
robustness against occlusion. In addition, we design an auxiliary spatial attention module by
learning a channel-wise attention vector to reweight the feature channels, which improves the
contributions of non-occluded regions. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks show that
the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods with a remarkable improvement.

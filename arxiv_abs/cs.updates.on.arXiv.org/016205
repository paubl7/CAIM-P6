Filters (such as Bloom Filters) are data structures that speed up network routing and measurement
operations by storing a compressed representation of a set. Filters are space efficient, but can
make bounded one-sided errors: with tunable probability epsilon, they may report that a query element
is stored in the filter when it is not. This is called a false positive. Recent research has focused
on designing methods for dynamically adapting filters to false positives, reducing the number
of false positives when some elements are queried repeatedly. Ideally, an adaptive filter would
incur a false positive with bounded probability epsilon for each new query element, and would incur
o(epsilon) total false positives over all repeated queries to that element. We call such a filter
support optimal. In this paper we design a new Adaptive Cuckoo Filter and show that it is support optimal
(up to additive logarithmic terms) over any n queries when storing a set of size n. Our filter is simple:
fixing previous false positives requires a simple cuckoo operation, and the filter does not need
to store any additional metadata. This data structure is the first practical data structure that
is support optimal, and the first filter that does not require additional space to fix false positives.
We complement these bounds with experiments showing that our data structure is effective at fixing
false positives on network traces, outperforming previous Adaptive Cuckoo Filters. Finally,
we investigate adversarial adaptivity, a stronger notion of adaptivity in which an adaptive adversary
repeatedly queries the filter, using the result of previous queries to drive the false positive
rate as high as possible. We prove a lower bound showing that a broad family of filters, including
all known Adaptive Cuckoo Filters, can be forced by such an adversary to incur a large number of false
positives.

Clinicians often do not sufficiently adhere to evidence-based clinical guidelines in a manner
sensitive to the context of each patient. It is important to detect such deviations, typically including
redundant or missing actions, even when the detection is performed retrospectively, so as to inform
both the attending clinician and policy makers. Furthermore, it would be beneficial to detect such
deviations in a manner proportional to the level of the deviation, and not to simply use arbitrary
cut-off values. In this study, we introduce a new approach for automated guideline-based quality
assessment of the care process, the bidirectional knowledge-based assessment of compliance (BiKBAC)
method. Our BiKBAC methodology assesses the degree of compliance when applying clinical guidelines,
with respect to multiple different aspects of the guideline (e.g., the guideline's process and
outcome objectives). The assessment is performed through a highly detailed, automated quality-assessment
retrospective analysis, which compares a formal representation of the guideline and of its process
and outcome intentions (we use the Asbru language for that purpose) with the longitudinal electronic
medical record of its continuous application over a significant time period, using both a top-down
and a bottom-up approach, which we explain in detail. Partial matches of the data to the process and
to the outcome objectives are resolved using fuzzy temporal logic. We also introduce the DiscovErr
system, which implements the BiKBAC approach, and present its detailed architecture. The DiscovErr
system was evaluated in a separate study in the type 2 diabetes management domain, by comparing its
performance to a panel of three clinicians, with highly encouraging results with respect to the
completeness and correctness of its comments.

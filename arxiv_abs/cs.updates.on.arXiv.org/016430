Distributed energy resources (DERs) such as responsive loads and energy storage systems are valuable
resources available to grid operators for balancing supply-demand mismatches via load coordination.
However, consumer acceptance of load coordination schemes depends on ensuring quality of service
(QoS), which embodies device-level constraints. Since each device has its own internal energy
state, the effect of QoS on the fleet can be cast as fleet-wide energy limits within which the aggregate
"state of charge" (SoC) must be actively maintained. This requires coordination of DERs that is
cognizant of the SoC, responsive to grid conditions, and depends on fast communication networks.
To that effect, this paper presents a novel real-time grid-and-DER co-simulation platform for
validating advanced DER coordination schemes and characterizing the capability of such a DER fleet.
In particular, we present how the co-simulation platform is suitable for: i) testing real-time
performance of a large fleet of DERs in delivering advanced grid services, including frequency
regulation; ii) online state estimation to characterize the corresponding SoC of a large fleet
of DERs; and iii) incorporating practical limitations of DERs and communications and analyzing
the effects on fleet-wide performance. To illustrate these benefits of the presented grid-DER
co-simulation platform, we employ the advanced DER coordination scheme called packetized energy
management (PEM), which is a novel device-driven, asynchronous, and randomizing control paradigm
for DERs. A fleet of thousands of PEM-enabled DERs are then added to a realistic and dynamical model
of the Vermont transmission system to complete validation of the co-simulation platform.

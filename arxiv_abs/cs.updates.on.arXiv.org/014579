Distributed renewable energy systems are now widely installed in many buildings, transforming
the buildings into electricity prosumers. Existing studies have developed some advanced building
side controls that enable renewable energy sharing and that aim to optimise building-cluster-level
performance via regulating the energy storage charging/ discharging. However, the flexible demand
shifting ability of electric vehicles is not considered in these building side controls. For instance,
the electric vehicle charging will usually start once they are plugged into charging stations.
But, in such charging period the renewable generation may be insufficient to cover the EV charging
load, leading to grid electricity imports. Consequently, the building-cluster-level performance
is not optimised. Therefore, this study proposes a coordinated control of building prosumers for
improving the cluster-level performance, by making use of energy sharing and storage capability
of electricity batteries in both buildings and EVs. An EV charging/discharging model is first developed.
Then, based on the predicted future 24h electricity demand and renewable generation data, the coordinated
control first considers the whole building cluster as one integrated building and optimises its
operation as well as the EV charging/discharging using genetic algorithm. Next, the operation
of individual buildings in the future 24h is coordinated using nonlinear programming. For validation,
the developed control has been tested on a real building cluster in Ludvika, Sweden. The study results
show that the developed control can increase the cluster-level daily renewable self-consumption
rate by 19% and meanwhile reduce the daily electricity bills by 36% compared with the conventional
controls.

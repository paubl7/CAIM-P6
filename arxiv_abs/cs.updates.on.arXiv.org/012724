Editing facial images created by StyleGAN is a popular research topic with important applications.
Through editing the latent vectors, it is possible to control the facial attributes such as smile,
age, \textit{etc}. However, facial attributes are entangled in the latent space and this makes
it very difficult to independently control a specific attribute without affecting the others.
The key to developing neat semantic control is to completely disentangle the latent space and perform
image editing in an unsupervised manner. In this paper, we present a new technique termed Structure-Texture
Independent Architecture with Weight Decomposition and Orthogonal Regularization (STIA-WO)
to disentangle the latent space. The GAN model, applying STIA-WO, is referred to as STGAN-WO. STGAN-WO
performs weight decomposition by utilizing the style vector to construct a fully controllable
weight matrix for controlling the image synthesis, and utilizes orthogonal regularization to
ensure each entry of the style vector only controls one factor of variation. To further disentangle
the facial attributes, STGAN-WO introduces a structure-texture independent architecture which
utilizes two independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) latent vectors to control the
synthesis of the texture and structure components in a disentangled way.Unsupervised semantic
editing is achieved by moving the latent code in the coarse layers along its orthogonal directions
to change texture related attributes or changing the latent code in the fine layers to manipulate
structure related ones. We present experimental results which show that our new STGAN-WO can achieve
better attribute editing than state of the art methods (The code is available at https://github.com/max-liu-112/STGAN-WO)

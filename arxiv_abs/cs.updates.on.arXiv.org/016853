We introduce an algorithm to remesh triangle meshes representing developable surfaces to planar
quad dominant meshes. The output of our algorithm consists of planar quadrilateral (PQ) strips
that are aligned to principal curvature directions and closely approximate the curved parts of
the input developable, and planar polygons representing the flat parts of the input. Developable
PQ-strip meshes are useful in many areas of shape modeling, thanks to the simplicity of fabrication
from flat sheet material. Unfortunately, they are difficult to model due to their restrictive combinatorics
and locking issues. Other representations of developable surfaces, such as arbitrary triangle
or quad meshes, are more suitable for interactive freeform modeling, but generally have non-planar
faces or are not aligned to principal curvatures. Our method leverages the modeling flexibility
of non-ruling based representations of developable surfaces, while still obtaining developable,
curvature aligned PQ-strip meshes. Our algorithm optimizes for a scalar function on the input mesh,
such that its level sets are extrinsically straight and align well to the locally estimated ruling
directions. The condition that guarantees straight level sets is nonlinear of high order and numerically
difficult to enforce in a straightforward manner. We devise an alternating optimization method
that makes our problem tractable and practical to compute. Our method works automatically on any
developable input, including multiple patches and curved folds, without explicit domain decomposition.
We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a variety of developable surfaces and show how
our remeshing can be used alongside handle based interactive freeform modeling of developable
shapes.

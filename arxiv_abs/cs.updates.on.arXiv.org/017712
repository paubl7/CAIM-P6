Robots in our daily surroundings are increasing day by day. Their usability and acceptability largely
depend on their explicit and implicit interaction capability with fellow human beings. As a result,
social behavior is one of the most sought-after qualities that a robot can possess. However, there
is no specific aspect and/or feature that defines socially acceptable behavior and it largely depends
on the situation, application, and society. In this article, we investigate one such social behavior
for collocated robots. Imagine a group of people is interacting with each other and we want to join
the group. We as human beings do it in a socially acceptable manner, i.e., within the group, we do position
ourselves in such a way that we can participate in the group activity without disturbing/obstructing
anybody. To possess such a quality, first, a robot needs to determine the formation of the group and
then determine a position for itself, which we humans do implicitly. The theory of f-formation can
be utilized for this purpose. As the types of formations can be very diverse, detecting the social
groups is not a trivial task. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the existing work
on social interaction and group detection using f-formation for robotics and other applications.
We also put forward a novel holistic survey framework combining all the possible concerns and modules
relevant to this problem. We define taxonomies based on methods, camera views, datasets, detection
capabilities and scale, evaluation approaches, and application areas. We discuss certain open
challenges and limitations in current literature along with possible future research directions
based on this framework. In particular, we discuss the existing methods/techniques and their relative
merits and demerits, applications, and provide a set of unsolved but relevant problems in this domain.

Accurate and efficient prediction of soft tissue temperatures is essential to computer-assisted
treatment systems for thermal ablation. It can be used to predict tissue temperatures and ablation
volumes for personalised treatment planning and image-guided intervention. Numerically, it
requires full nonlinear modelling of the coupled computational bioheat transfer and biomechanics,
and efficient solution procedures; however, existing studies considered the bioheat analysis
alone or the coupled linear analysis, without the fully coupled nonlinear analysis. We present
a coupled thermo-visco-hyperelastic finite element algorithm, based on finite-strain thermoelasticity
and total Lagrangian explicit dynamics. It considers the coupled nonlinear analysis of (i) bioheat
transfer under soft tissue deformations and (ii) soft tissue deformations due to thermal expansion/shrinkage.
The presented method accounts for anisotropic, finite-strain, temperature-dependent, thermal,
and viscoelastic behaviours of soft tissues, and it is implemented using GPU acceleration for real-time
computation. We also demonstrate the translational benefits of the presented method for clinical
applications using a simulation of thermal ablation in the liver. The key advantage of the presented
method is that it enables full nonlinear modelling of the anisotropic, finite-strain, temperature-dependent,
thermal, and viscoelastic behaviours of soft tissues, instead of linear elastic, linear viscoelastic,
and thermal-only modelling in the existing methods. It also provides high computational speeds
for computer-assisted treatment systems towards enabling the operator to simulate thermal ablation
accurately and visualise tissue temperatures and ablation zones immediately.

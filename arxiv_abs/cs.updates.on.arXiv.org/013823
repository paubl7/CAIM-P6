Recently, we have seen a rapid rise in usage of online educational platforms. The personalized education
became crucially important in future learning environments. Knowledge tracing (KT) refers to
the detection of students' knowledge states and predict future performance given their past outcomes
for providing adaptive solution to Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS). Bayesian Knowledge Tracing
(BKT) is a model to capture mastery level of each skill with psychologically meaningful parameters
and widely used in successful tutoring systems. However, it is unable to detect learning transfer
across skills because each skill model is learned independently and shows lower efficiency in student
performance prediction. While recent KT models based on deep neural networks shows impressive
predictive power but it came with a price. Ten of thousands of parameters in neural networks are unable
to provide psychologically meaningful interpretation that reflect to cognitive theory. In this
paper, we proposed an efficient student model called BKT-LSTM. It contains three meaningful components:
individual \textit{skill mastery} assessed by BKT, \textit{ability profile} (learning transfer
across skills) detected by k-means clustering and \textit{problem difficulty}. All these components
are taken into account in student's future performance prediction by leveraging predictive power
of LSTM. BKT-LSTM outperforms state-of-the-art student models in student's performance prediction
by considering these meaningful features instead of using binary values of student's past interaction
in DKT. We also conduct ablation studies on each of BKT-LSTM model components to examine their value
and each component shows significant contribution in student's performance prediction. Thus,
it has potential for providing adaptive and personalized instruction in real-world educational
systems.

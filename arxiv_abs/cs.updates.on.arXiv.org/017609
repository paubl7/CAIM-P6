Time-series data are one of the fundamental types of raw data representation used in data-driven
techniques. In machine condition monitoring, time-series vibration data are overly used in data
mining for deep neural networks. Typically, vibration data is converted into images for classification
using Deep Neural Networks (DNNs), and scalograms are the most effective form of image representation.
However, the DNN classifiers require huge labeled training samples to reach their optimum performance.
So, many forms of data augmentation techniques are applied to the classifiers to compensate for
the lack of training samples. However, the scalograms are graphical representations where the
existing augmentation techniques suffer because they either change the graphical meaning or have
too much noise in the samples that change the physical meaning. In this study, a data augmentation
technique named ensemble augmentation is proposed to overcome this limitation. This augmentation
method uses the power of white noise added in ensembles to the original samples to generate real-like
samples. After averaging the signal with ensembles, a new signal is obtained that contains the characteristics
of the original signal. The parameters for the ensemble augmentation are validated using a simulated
signal. The proposed method is evaluated using 10 class bearing vibration data using three state-of-the-art
Transfer Learning (TL) models, namely, Inception-V3, MobileNet-V2, and ResNet50. Augmented
samples are generated in two increments: the first increment generates the same number of fake samples
as the training samples, and in the second increment, the number of samples is increased gradually.
The outputs from the proposed method are compared with no augmentation, augmentations using deep
convolution generative adversarial network (DCGAN), and several geometric transformation-based
augmentations...

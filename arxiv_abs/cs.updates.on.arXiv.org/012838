Community electricity storage systems for multiple applications promise benefits over household
electricity storage systems. More economical flexibility options such as demand response and
sector coupling might reduce the market size for storage facilities. This paper assesses the economic
performance of community electricity storage systems by taking competitive flexibility options
into account. For this purpose, an actor-related, scenario-based optimization framework is applied.
The results are in line with the literature and show that community storage systems are economically
more efficient than household storage systems. Relative storage capacity reductions of community
storage systems over household storage systems are possible, as the demand and generation profiles
are balanced out among end users. On average, storage capacity reductions of 9% per household are
possible in the base case, resulting in lower specific investments. The simultaneous application
of demand-side flexibility options such as sector coupling and demand response enable a further
capacity reduction of the community storage size by up to 23%. At the same time, the competition between
flexibility options leads to smaller benefits regarding the community storage flexibility potential,
which reduces the market viability for these applications. In the worst case, the cannibalization
effects reach up to 38% between the flexibility measures. The losses of the flexibility benefits
outweigh the savings of the capacity reduction whereby sector coupling constitutes a far greater
influencing factor than demand response. Overall, in consideration of the stated cost trends,
the economies of scale, and the reduction possibilities, a profitable community storage model
might be reached between 2025 and 2035. Future work should focus on the analysis of policy frameworks.

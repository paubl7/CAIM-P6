Current capsule endoscopes and next-generation robotic capsules for diagnosis and treatment
of gastrointestinal diseases are complex cyber-physical platforms that must orchestrate complex
software and hardware functions. The desired tasks for these systems include visual localization,
depth estimation, 3D mapping, disease detection and segmentation, automated navigation, active
control, path realization and optional therapeutic modules such as targeted drug delivery and
biopsy sampling. Data-driven algorithms promise to enable many advanced functionalities for
capsule endoscopes, but real-world data is challenging to obtain. Physically-realistic simulations
providing synthetic data have emerged as a solution to the development of data-driven algorithms.
In this work, we present a comprehensive simulation platform for capsule endoscopy operations
and introduce VR-Caps, a virtual active capsule environment that simulates a range of normal and
abnormal tissue conditions (e.g., inflated, dry, wet etc.) and varied organ types, capsule endoscope
designs (e.g., mono, stereo, dual and 360{\deg}camera), and the type, number, strength, and placement
of internal and external magnetic sources that enable active locomotion. VR-Caps makes it possible
to both independently or jointly develop, optimize, and test medical imaging and analysis software
for the current and next-generation endoscopic capsule systems. To validate this approach, we
train state-of-the-art deep neural networks to accomplish various medical image analysis tasks
using simulated data from VR-Caps and evaluate the performance of these models on real medical data.
Results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the proposed virtual platform in developing
algorithms that quantify fractional coverage, camera trajectory, 3D map reconstruction, and
disease classification.

The interest in dynamic processes on networks is steadily rising in recent years. In this paper,
we consider the $(\alpha,\beta)$-Thresholded Network Dynamics ($(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics),
where $\alpha\leq \beta$, in which only structural dynamics (dynamics of the network) are allowed,
guided by local thresholding rules executed in each node. In particular, in each discrete round
$t$, each pair of nodes $u$ and $v$ that are allowed to communicate by the scheduler, computes a value
$\mathcal{E}(u,v)$ (the potential of the pair) as a function of the local structure of the network
at round $t$ around the two nodes. If $\mathcal{E}(u,v) < \alpha$ then the link (if it exists) between
$u$ and $v$ is removed; if $\alpha \leq \mathcal{E}(u,v) < \beta$ then an existing link among $u$
and $v$ is maintained; if $\beta \leq \mathcal{E}(u,v)$ then a link between $u$ and $v$ is established
if not already present. The microscopic structure of $(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics appears to be
simple, so that we are able to rigorously argue about it, but still flexible, so that we are able to
design meaningful microscopic local rules that give rise to interesting macroscopic behaviors.
Our goals are the following: a) to investigate the properties of the $(\alpha,\beta)$-Thresholded
Network Dynamics and b) to show that $(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics is expressive enough to solve complex
problems on networks. Our contribution in these directions is twofold. We rigorously exhibit the
claim about the expressiveness of $(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics, both by designing a simple protocol
that provably computes the $k$-core of the network as well as by showing that $(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics
is in fact Turing-Complete. Second and most important, we construct general tools for proving stabilization
that work for a subclass of $(\alpha,\beta)$-Dynamics and prove speed of convergence in a restricted
setting.

Uncertainty quantification techniques such as the time-dependent generalized polynomial chaos
(TD-gPC) use an adaptive orthogonal basis to better represent the stochastic part of the solution
space (aka random function space) in time. However, because the random function space is constructed
using tensor products, TD-gPC-based methods are known to suffer from the curse of dimensionality.
In this paper, we introduce a new numerical method called the 'flow-driven spectral chaos' (FSC)
which overcomes this curse of dimensionality at the random-function-space level. The proposed
method is not only computationally more efficient than existing TD-gPC-based methods but is also
far more accurate. The FSC method uses the concept of 'enriched stochastic flow maps' to track the
evolution of a finite-dimensional random function space efficiently in time. To transfer the probability
information from one random function space to another, two approaches are developed and studied
herein. In the first approach, the probability information is transferred in the mean-square sense,
whereas in the second approach the transfer is done exactly using a new theorem that was developed
for this purpose. The FSC method can quantify uncertainties with high fidelity, especially for
the long-time response of stochastic dynamical systems governed by ODEs of arbitrary order. Six
representative numerical examples, including a nonlinear problem (the Van-der-Pol oscillator),
are presented to demonstrate the performance of the FSC method and corroborate the claims of its
superior numerical properties. Finally, a parametric, high-dimensional stochastic problem
is used to demonstrate that when the FSC method is used in conjunction with Monte Carlo integration,
the curse of dimensionality can be overcome altogether.

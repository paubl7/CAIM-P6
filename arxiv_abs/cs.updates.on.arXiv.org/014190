Literature analysis facilitates researchers to acquire a good understanding of the development
of science and technology. The traditional literature analysis focuses largely on the literature
metadata such as topics, authors, abstracts, keywords, references, etc., and little attention
was paid to the main content of papers. In many scientific domains such as science, computing, engineering,
etc., the methods and datasets involved in the scientific papers published in those domains carry
important information and are quite useful for domain analysis as well as algorithm and dataset
recommendation. In this paper, we propose a novel entity recognition model, called MDER, which
is able to effectively extract the method and dataset entities from the main textual content of scientific
papers. The model utilizes rule embedding and adopts a parallel structure of CNN and Bi-LSTM with
the self-attention mechanism. We evaluate the proposed model on datasets which are constructed
from the published papers of four research areas in computer science, i.e., NLP, CV, Data Mining
and AI. The experimental results demonstrate that our model performs well in all the four areas and
it features a good learning capacity for cross-area learning and recognition. We also conduct experiments
to evaluate the effectiveness of different building modules within our model which indicate that
the importance of different building modules in collectively contributing to the good entity recognition
performance as a whole. The data augmentation experiments on our model demonstrated that data augmentation
positively contributes to model training, making our model much more robust in dealing with the
scenarios where only small number of training samples are available. We finally apply our model
on PAKDD papers published from 2009-2019 to mine insightful results from scientific papers published
in a longer time span.

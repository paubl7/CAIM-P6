Purpose: This study evaluates the effectiveness and impact of automated order-based protocol
assignment for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams using natural language processing (NLP)
and deep learning (DL). Methods: NLP tools were applied to retrospectively process orders from
over 116,000 MRI exams with 200 unique sub-specialized protocols ("Local" protocol class). Separate
DL models were trained on 70\% of the processed data for "Local" protocols as well as 93 American College
of Radiology ("ACR") protocols and 48 "General" protocols. The DL Models were assessed in an "auto-protocoling
(AP)" inference mode which returns the top recommendation and in a "clinical decision support (CDS)"
inference mode which returns up to 10 protocols for radiologist review. The accuracy of each protocol
recommendation was computed and analyzed based on the difference between the normalized output
score of the corresponding neural net for the top two recommendations. Results: The top predicted
protocol in AP mode was correct for 82.8%, 73.8%, and 69.3% of the test cases for "General", "ACR",
and "Local" protocol classes, respectively. Higher levels of accuracy over 96% were obtained for
all protocol classes in CDS mode. However, at current validation performance levels, the proposed
models offer modest, positive, financial impact on large-scale imaging networks. Conclusions:
DL-based protocol automation is feasible and can be tuned to route substantial fractions of exams
for auto-protocoling, with higher accuracy with more general protocols. Economic analyses of
the tested algorithms indicate that improved algorithm performance is required to yield a practical
exam auto-protocoling tool for sub-specialized imaging exams.

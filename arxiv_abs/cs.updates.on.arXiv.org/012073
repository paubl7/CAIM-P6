As we all know, users and item-providers are two main groups of participants in recommender systems.
The main task of this paper is to significantly improve the coverage fairness (item-provider oriented
objective), and simultaneously keep the recommendation accuracy in a high level (user oriented
objective). First, an effective and totally robust approach of improving the coverage fairness
is proposed, that is to constrain the allowed recommendation times of an item to be proportional
to the frequency of its being purchased in the past. Second, in this constrained recommendation
scenario, a serial of heuristic strategies of user-item matching priority are proposed to minimize
the loss of recommendation accuracy. The parameterized strategy among them is validated to achieve
better recommendation accuracy than the baseline algorithm in regular recommendation scenario,
and it has an overwhelming superiority in coverage fairness over the regular algorithm. Third,
to get the optimal solution of this user-item matching problem, we design a Minimum Cost Maximum
Flow model, which achieves almost the same value of coverage fairness and even better accuracy performance
than the parameterized heuristic strategy. Finally, we empirically demonstrate that, even compared
with several state-of-the-art enhanced versions of the baseline algorithm, our framework of the
constrained recommendation scenario coupled with the MCMF user-item matching priority strategy
still has a several-to-one advantage in the coverage fairness, while its recommendation precision
is more than 90% of the best value of all the enhanced algorithms. What is more, our proposed framework
is parameter-free and thus achieves this superior performance without the time cost of parameter
optimization, while all the above existing enhanced algorithms have to traverse their intrinsic
parameter to get the best performance.

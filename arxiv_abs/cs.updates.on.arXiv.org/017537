This paper outlines an exact and a heuristic algorithm for the electric vehicle routing problem
with a nonlinear charging function (E-VRP-NL) introduced by Montoya et al. (2017). The E-VRP-NL
captures several realistic features of electric vehicles including the battery limited driving
range and nonlinear charging process at the charging stations. We formulate this problem as a set-partitioning
and solve it using a column generation based algorithm. The resulting pricing problem of the column
generation is a complicated problem as, next to the usual operational constraints e.g. time windows
and vehicle capacity, electric vehicle related features are also considered. In particular, the
nonlinear nature of the battery charging process requires the incorporation of a set of sophisticated
recursive functions in the pricing algorithm. We show how these recursive functions allow for the
simultaneous evaluation of the routing and charging decisions. Moreover, we illustrate how they
can efficiently be embedded in the pricing algorithm. The column generation algorithm is integrated
in a branch and bound algorithm and cutting planes are added resulting in a branch-and-price-and-cut
algorithm for the E-VRP-NL. Next to the exact algorithm, we also develop a tabu search based heuristic
to solve the problem quickly. To prove the efficiency of the proposed algorithms, their performance
is tested on benchmark instances from the literature. Our exact algorithm can optimally solve instances
with up to 40 customers, including several instances previously unsolved to optimality. The tabu
search heuristic proves to be superior to state-of-the-art heuristics in the literature both on
solution quality and computation times.

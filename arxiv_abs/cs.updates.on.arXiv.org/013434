Population protocols are a class of algorithms for modeling distributed computation in networks
of finite-state agents communicating through pairwise interactions. Their suitability for analyzing
numerous chemical processes has motivated the adaptation of the original population protocol
framework to better model these chemical systems. In this paper, we further the study of two such
adaptations in the context of solving approximate majority: persistent-state agents (or catalysts)
and spontaneous state changes (or leaks). Based on models considered in recent protocols for populations
with persistent-state agents, we assume a population with $n$ catalytic input agents and $m$ worker
agents, and the goal of the worker agents is to compute some predicate over the states of the catalytic
inputs. We call this model the Catalytic Input (CI) model. For $m = \Theta(n)$, we show that computing
the parity of the input population with high probability requires at least $\Omega(n^2)$ total
interactions, demonstrating a strong separation between the CI model and the standard population
protocol model. On the other hand, we show that the simple third-state dynamics of Angluin et al.
for approximate majority in the standard model can be naturally adapted to the CI model: we present
such a constant-state protocol for the CI model that solves approximate majority in $O(n \log n)$
total steps with high probability when the input margin is $\Omega(\sqrt{n \log n})$. We then show
the robustness of third-state dynamics protocols to the transient leaks events introduced by Alistarh
et al. In both the original and CI models, these protocols successfully compute approximate majority
with high probability in the presence of leaks occurring at each step with probability $\beta \leq
O\left(\sqrt{n \log n}/n\right)$, exhibiting a resilience to leaks similar to that of Byzantine
agents in previous works.

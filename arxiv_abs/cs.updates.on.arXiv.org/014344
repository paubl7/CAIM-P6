Community detection is a key task to further understand the function and the structure of complex
networks. Therefore, a strategy used to assess this task must be able to avoid biased and incorrect
results that might invalidate further analyses or applications that rely on such communities.
Two widely used strategies to assess this task are generally known as structural and functional.
The structural strategy basically consists in detecting and assessing such communities by using
multiple methods and structural metrics. On the other hand, the functional strategy might be used
when ground truth data are available to assess the detected communities. However, the evaluation
of communities based on such strategies is usually done in experimental configurations that are
largely susceptible to biases, a situation that is inherent to algorithms, metrics and network
data used in this task. Furthermore, such strategies are not systematically combined in a way that
allows for the identification and mitigation of bias in the algorithms, metrics or network data
to converge into more consistent results. In this context, the main contribution of this article
is an approach that supports a robust quality evaluation when detecting communities in real-world
networks. In our approach, we measure the quality of a community by applying the structural and functional
strategies, and the combination of both, to obtain different pieces of evidence. Then, we consider
the divergences and the consensus among the pieces of evidence to identify and overcome possible
sources of bias in community detection algorithms, evaluation metrics, and network data. Experiments
conducted with several real and synthetic networks provided results that show the effectiveness
of our approach to obtain more consistent conclusions about the quality of the detected communities.

Knowledge of how science is consumed in public domains is essential for a deeper understanding of
the role of science in human society. While science is heavily supported by public funding, common
depictions suggest that scientific research remains an isolated or 'ivory tower' activity, with
weak connectivity to public use, little relationship between the quality of research and its public
use, and little correspondence between the funding of science and its public use. This paper introduces
a measurement framework to examine public good features of science, allowing us to study public
uses of science, the public funding of science, and how use and funding relate. Specifically, we
integrate five large-scale datasets that link scientific publications from all scientific fields
to their upstream funding support and downstream public uses across three public domains - government
documents, the news media, and marketplace invention. We find that the public uses of science are
extremely diverse, with different public domains drawing distinctively across scientific fields.
Yet amidst these differences, we find key forms of alignment in the interface between science and
society. First, despite concerns that the public does not engage high-quality science, we find
universal alignment, in each scientific field and public domain, between what the public consumes
and what is highly impactful within science. Second, despite myriad factors underpinning the public
funding of science, the resulting allocation across fields presents a striking alignment with
the field's collective public use. Overall, public uses of science present a rich landscape of specialized
consumption, yet collectively science and society interface with remarkable, quantifiable alignment
between scientific use, public use, and funding.

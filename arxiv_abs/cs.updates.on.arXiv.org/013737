Due to the intrinsically inefficient service provisioning in traditional networks, Network Function
Virtualization (NFV) keeps gaining attention from both industry and academia. By replacing the
purpose-built, expensive, proprietary network equipment with software network functions consolidated
on commodity hardware, NFV envisions a shift towards a more agile and open service provisioning
paradigm with much lower capital expenditure (CapEx) and operational expenditure (OpEx). Nonetheless,
just like any complex system, NFV platforms commonly consist of abounding software and hardware
components and usually incorporate disparate design choices based on distinct motivations or
use cases. This broad collection of convoluted alternatives makes it extremely arduous for network
operators to make proper choices. Although numerous efforts have been devoted to investigating
different aspects of NFV, none of them specifically focused on NFV platforms or attempted to explore
the design space. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on NFV platform design. Our study
solely targets existing NFV platform implementations. We begin with an architectural view of the
standard reference NFV platform and present our taxonomy of existing NFV platforms based on the
principal purpose of design. Then we thoroughly explore the design space and elaborate on the implementation
choices each platform opts for. We believe that our study gives a detailed guideline for network
operators or service providers to choose or implement the most appropriate NFV platforms based
on their respective requirements. Note that this report serves as a complementary document for
a published IEEE TNSM paper [1]. We will periodically update this document to include the newly proposed
NFV platforms and design choices.

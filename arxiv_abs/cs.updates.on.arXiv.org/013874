For health prognostic task, ever-increasing efforts have been focused on machine learning-based
methods, which are capable of yielding accurate remaining useful life (RUL) estimation for industrial
equipment or components without exploring the degradation mechanism. A prerequisite ensuring
the success of these methods depends on a wealth of run-to-failure data, however, run-to-failure
data may be insufficient in practice. That is, conducting a substantial amount of destructive experiments
not only is high costs, but also may cause catastrophic consequences. Out of this consideration,
an enhanced RUL framework focusing on data self-generation is put forward for both non-cyclic and
cyclic degradation patterns for the first time. It is designed to enrich data from a data-driven
way, generating realistic-like time-series to enhance current RUL methods. First, high-quality
data generation is ensured through the proposed convolutional recurrent generative adversarial
network (CR-GAN), which adopts a two-channel fusion convolutional recurrent neural network.
Next, a hierarchical framework is proposed to combine generated data into current RUL estimation
methods. Finally, the efficacy of the proposed method is verified through both non-cyclic and cyclic
degradation systems. With the enhanced RUL framework, an aero-engine system following non-cyclic
degradation has been tested using three typical RUL models. State-of-art RUL estimation results
are achieved by enhancing capsule network with generated time-series. Specifically, estimation
errors evaluated by the index score function have been reduced by 21.77%, and 32.67% for the two employed
operating conditions, respectively. Besides, the estimation error is reduced to zero for the Lithium-ion
battery system, which presents cyclic degradation.

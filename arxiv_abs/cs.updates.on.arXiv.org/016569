This paper studies the economics of carbon-neutral synthetic fuel production from renewable electricity
in remote areas where high-quality renewable resources are abundant. To this end, a graph-based
optimisation modelling framework directly applicable to the strategic planning of remote renewable
energy supply chains is proposed. More precisely, a hypergraph abstraction of planning problems
is introduced, wherein nodes can be viewed as optimisation subproblems with their own parameters,
variables, constraints and local objective. Nodes typically represent a subsystem such as a technology,
a plant or a process. Hyperedges, on the other hand, express the connectivity between subsystems.
The framework is leveraged to study the economics of carbon-neutral synthetic methane production
from solar and wind energy in North Africa and its delivery to Northwestern European markets. The
full supply chain is modelled in an integrated fashion, which makes it possible to accurately capture
the interaction between various technologies on an hourly time scale. Results suggest that the
cost of synthetic methane production and delivery would be slightly under 150 EUR/MWh (higher heating
value) by 2030 for a system supplying 10 TWh annually and relying on a combination of solar photovoltaic
and wind power plants, assuming a uniform weighted average cost of capital of 7%. A comprehensive
sensitivity analysis is also carried out in order to assess the impact of various techno-economic
parameters and assumptions on synthetic methane cost, including the availability of wind power
plants, the investment costs of electrolysis, methanation and direct air capture plants, their
operational flexibility, the energy consumption of direct air capture plants, and financing costs.

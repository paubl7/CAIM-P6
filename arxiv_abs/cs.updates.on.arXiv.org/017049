The next wave of wireless technologies is proliferating in connecting things among themselves
as well as to humans. In the era of the Internet of things (IoT), billions of sensors, machines, vehicles,
drones, and robots will be connected, making the world around us smarter. The IoT will encompass
devices that must wirelessly communicate a diverse set of data gathered from the environment for
myriad new applications. The ultimate goal is to extract insights from this data and develop solutions
that improve quality of life and generate new revenue. Providing large-scale, long-lasting, reliable,
and near real-time connectivity is the major challenge in enabling a smart connected world. This
paper provides a comprehensive survey on existing and emerging communication solutions for serving
IoT applications in the context of cellular, wide-area, as well as non-terrestrial networks. Specifically,
wireless technology enhancements for providing IoT access in fifth-generation (5G) and beyond
cellular networks, and communication networks over the unlicensed spectrum are presented. Aligned
with the main key performance indicators of 5G and beyond 5G networks, we investigate solutions
and standards that enable energy efficiency, reliability, low latency, and scalability (connection
density) of current and future IoT networks. The solutions include grant-free access and channel
coding for short-packet communications, non-orthogonal multiple access, and on-device intelligence.
Further, a vision of new paradigm shifts in communication networks in the 2030s is provided, and
the integration of the associated new technologies like artificial intelligence, non-terrestrial
networks, and new spectra is elaborated. Finally, future research directions toward beyond 5G
IoT networks are pointed out.

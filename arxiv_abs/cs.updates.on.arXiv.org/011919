Deep Learning-based computational pathology algorithms have demonstrated profound ability
to excel in a wide array of tasks that range from characterization of well known morphological phenotypes
to predicting non-human-identifiable features from histology such as molecular alterations.
However, the development of robust, adaptable, and accurate deep learning-based models often
rely on the collection and time-costly curation large high-quality annotated training data that
should ideally come from diverse sources and patient populations to cater for the heterogeneity
that exists in such datasets. Multi-centric and collaborative integration of medical data across
multiple institutions can naturally help overcome this challenge and boost the model performance
but is limited by privacy concerns amongst other difficulties that may arise in the complex data
sharing process as models scale towards using hundreds of thousands of gigapixel whole slide images.
In this paper, we introduce privacy-preserving federated learning for gigapixel whole slide images
in computational pathology using weakly-supervised attention multiple instance learning and
differential privacy. We evaluated our approach on two different diagnostic problems using thousands
of histology whole slide images with only slide-level labels. Additionally, we present a weakly-supervised
learning framework for survival prediction and patient stratification from whole slide images
and demonstrate its effectiveness in a federated setting. Our results show that using federated
learning, we can effectively develop accurate weakly supervised deep learning models from distributed
data silos without direct data sharing and its associated complexities, while also preserving
differential privacy using randomized noise generation.

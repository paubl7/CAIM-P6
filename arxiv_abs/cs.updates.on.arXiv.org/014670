Recommender systems (RS) work effective at alleviating information overload and matching user
interests in various web-scale applications. Most RS retrieve the user's favorite candidates
and then rank them by the rating scores in the greedy manner. In the permutation prospective, however,
current RS come to reveal the following two limitations: 1) They neglect addressing the permutation-variant
influence within the recommended results; 2) Permutation consideration extends the latent solution
space exponentially, and current RS lack the ability to evaluate the permutations. Both drive RS
away from the permutation-optimal recommended results and better user experience. To approximate
the permutation-optimal recommended results effectively and efficiently, we propose a novel
permutation-wise framework PRS in the re-ranking stage of RS, which consists of Permutation-Matching
(PMatch) and Permutation-Ranking (PRank) stages successively. Specifically, the PMatch stage
is designed to obtain the candidate list set, where we propose the FPSA algorithm to generate multiple
candidate lists via the permutation-wise and goal-oriented beam search algorithm. Afterwards,
for the candidate list set, the PRank stage provides a unified permutation-wise ranking criterion
named LR metric, which is calculated by the rating scores of elaborately designed permutation-wise
model DPWN. Finally, the list with the highest LR score is recommended to the user. Empirical results
show that PRS consistently and significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods. Moreover,
PRS has achieved a performance improvement of 11.0% on PV metric and 8.7% on IPV metric after the successful
deployment in one popular recommendation scenario of Taobao application.

The alarmingly high mortality rate and increasing global prevalence of cardiovascular diseases
(CVDs) signify the crucial need for early detection schemes. Phonocardiogram(PCG) signals has
been historically applied in this domain owing to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. However,
insufficiency of expert physicians and human subjectivity affect the applicability of this technique,
especially in the low-resource settings. For resolving this issue, in this paper, we introduce
CardioXNet,a novel lightweight CRNN architecture for automatic detection of five classes of cardiac
auscultation namely normal, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, mitral regurgitation and mitral
valve prolapse using raw PCG signal. The process has been automated by the involvement of two learning
phases namely, representation learning and sequence residual learning. The first phase mainly
focuses on automated feature extraction and it has been implemented in a modular way with three parallel
CNN pathways i.e., frequency feature extractor (FFE), pattern extractor (PE) and adaptive feature
extractor (AFE). 1D-CNN based FFE and PE respectively learn the coarse and fine-grained features
from the PCG while AFE explores the salient features from variable receptive fields involving 2D-CNN
based squeezeexpansion. Thus, in the representation learning phase, the network extracts efficient
time-invariant features and converges with great rapidity. In the sequential residual learning
phase,because of the bidirectional-LSTMs and the skip connection, the network can proficiently
extract temporal features. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end architecture
yields outstanding performance in all the evaluation metrics compared to the previous state-of-the-art
methods with up to 99.6% accuracy, 99.6% precision, 99.6% recall and 99.4% F1-score on an average
while being computationally comparable.

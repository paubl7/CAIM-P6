In wheel rail adhesion studies, most of the test rigs used are simplified designs such as a single
wheel or wheelset, but the results may not be accurate. Alternatively, representing the complex
system by using a full vehicle model provides accurate results but may incur complexity in design.
To trade off accuracy over complexity, a bogie model can be the optimum selection. Furthermore,
only a real time model can replicate its physical counterpart in the time domain. Developing such
a model requires broad expertise and appropriate software and hardware. A few published works are
available which deal with real time modeling. However, the influence of the control system has not
been included in those works. To address these issues, a real-time scaled bogie test rig including
the control system is essential. Therefore, a 1:4 scaled bogie roller rig is developed to study the
adhesion between wheel and roller contact. To compare the performances obtained from the scaled
bogie test rig and to expand the test applications, a numerical simulation model of that scaled bogie
test rig is developed using Gensys multibody software. This model is the complete model of the test
rig which delivers more precise results. To exactly represent the physical counterpart system
in the time domain, a real-time scaled bogie test rig (RT SBTR) is developed after four consecutive
stages. Then, to simulate the RT-SBTR to solve the internal state equations and functions representing
the physical counterpart system in equal or less than actual time, the real-time simulation environment
is prepared in two stages. To such end, the computational time improved from 4 times slower than real
time to 2 times faster than real time. Finally, the real time scaled bogie model is also incorporated
with the braking control system which slightly reduces the computational performances without
affecting real time capability.

Quantum noise is the key challenge in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Limited
research efforts have explored a higher level of optimization by making the quantum circuit resilient
to noise. We propose and experimentally implement QuantumNAS, the first comprehensive framework
for noise-adaptive co-search of variational circuit and qubit mapping. Variational quantum circuits
are a promising approach for constructing quantum neural networks for machine learning and variational
ansatzes for quantum simulation. However, finding the best variational circuit and its optimal
parameters is challenging in a high-dimensional Hilbert space. We propose to decouple the parameter
training and circuit search by introducing a novel gate-sharing SuperCircuit. The SuperCircuit
is trained by sampling and updating the SubCircuits in it and provides an accurate estimation of
SubCircuit performance trained from scratch. Then we perform an evolutionary co-search of SubCircuit
and its qubit mapping. The SubCircuit performance is estimated with parameters inherited from
SuperCircuit and simulated with real device noise models. Finally, we perform iterative gate pruning
and finetuning to further remove the redundant gates in a fine-grained manner. Extensively evaluated
with 12 QML and VQE benchmarks on 10 quantum computers, QuantumNAS significantly outperforms noise-unaware
search, human and random baselines. For QML tasks, QuantumNAS is the first to demonstrate over 95%
2-class, 85% 4-class, and 32% 10-class classification accuracy on real quantum computers. It also
achieves the lowest eigenvalue for VQE tasks on H2, H2O, LiH, CH4, BeH2 compared with UCCSD baselines.
We also open-source QuantumEngine (https://github.com/mit-han-lab/pytorch-quantum) for
fast training of parameterized quantum circuits to facilitate future research.

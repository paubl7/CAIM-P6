Recently, there has been an increased interest in the development of kernel methods for learning
with sequential data. The signature kernel is a learning tool with potential to handle irregularly
sampled, multivariate time series. In "Kernels for sequentially ordered data" the authors introduced
a kernel trick for the truncated version of this kernel avoiding the exponential complexity that
would have been involved in a direct computation. Here we show that for continuously differentiable
paths, the signature kernel solves a hyperbolic PDE and recognize the connection with a well known
class of differential equations known in the literature as Goursat problems. This Goursat PDE only
depends on the increments of the input sequences, does not require the explicit computation of signatures
and can be solved efficiently using state-of-the-arthyperbolic PDE numerical solvers, giving
a kernel trick for the untruncated signature kernel, with the same raw complexity as the method from
"Kernels for sequentially ordered data", but with the advantage that the PDE numerical scheme is
well suited for GPU parallelization, which effectively reduces the complexity by a full order of
magnitude in the length of the input sequences. In addition, we extend the previous analysis to the
space of geometric rough paths and establish, using classical results from rough path theory, that
the rough version of the signature kernel solves a rough integral equation analogous to the aforementioned
Goursat PDE. Finally, we empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our PDE kernel as a machine
learning tool in various machine learning applications dealing with sequential data. We release
the library sigkernel publicly available at https://github.com/crispitagorico/sigkernel.

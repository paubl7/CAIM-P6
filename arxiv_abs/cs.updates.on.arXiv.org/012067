A weighted directed network (WDN) is a directed graph in which each edge is associated to a unique
value called weight. These networks are very suitable for modeling real-world social networks
in which there is an assessment of one vertex toward other vertices. One of the main problems studied
in this paper is prediction of edge weights in such networks. We introduce, for the first time, a metric
geometry approach to studying edge weight prediction in WDNs. We modify a usual notion of WDNs, and
introduce a new type of WDNs which we coin the term \textit{almost-weighted directed networks}
(AWDNs). AWDNs can capture the weight information of a network from a given training set. We then
construct a class of metrics (or distances) for AWDNs which equips such networks with a metric space
structure. Using the metric geometry structure of AWDNs, we propose modified $k$ nearest neighbors
(kNN) methods and modified support-vector machine (SVM) methods which will then be used to predict
edge weights in AWDNs. In many real-world datasets, in addition to edge weights, one can also associate
weights to vertices which capture information of vertices; association of weights to vertices
especially plays an important role in graph embedding problems. Adopting a similar approach, we
introduce two new types of directed networks in which weights are associated to either a subset of
origin vertices or a subset of terminal vertices . We, for the first time, construct novel classes
of metrics on such networks, and based on these new metrics propose modified $k$NN and SVM methods
for predicting weights of origins and terminals in these networks. We provide experimental results
on several real-world datasets, using our geometric methodologies.

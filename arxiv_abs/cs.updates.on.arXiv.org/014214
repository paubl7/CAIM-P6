The recent advent of connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) is expected to transform the transportation
system. CAV technologies are being developed rapidly and they are foreseen to penetrate the market
at a rapid pace. On the other hand, work zones (WZs) have become common areas on highway systems as
a result of the increasing construction and maintenance activities. The near future will therefore
bring the coexistence of CAVs and WZs which makes their interaction inevitable. WZs expose all vehicles
to a sudden and complex geometric change in the roadway environment, something that may challenge
many of CAV navigation capabilities. WZs however also impose a space contraction resulting in adverse
traffic operational and safety impacts, something that legitimately calls for benefiting from
the highly efficient CAV mobility and safety functions. CAVs should be able to reliably traverse
WZ geometry and WZs should benefit from CAV intelligent functions. This paper explores the key concepts
of deploying CAV systems at WZs with a focus on mobility, safety, and infrastructure considerations.
CAV concepts were distributed over the WZ area which was subdivided into five segments: further
upstream, approach area, queuing area, WZ activity, and termination area. The paper also provides
a review on the recent literature and summarizes a research agenda. The paper aims to provide a bird`s
eye view, but with necessary details that can benefit practitioners, planners, and transportation
agencies. Existing findings show that CAVs can credibly solve many WZ mobility and safety challenges,
CAV benefits however are very sensitive to market penetration rate, traffic volume, communication
technologies, and the assumed driver behaviour. A plenty of research work has yet to be organized
and conducted in order to better harmonize the forthcoming coexistence between CAVs and WZs.

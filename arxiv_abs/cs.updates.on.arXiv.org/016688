The flourish of web-based services gave birth to the research area \textit{services computing},
a rapidly-expanding academic community since nearly 20 years ago. Consensus has been reached on
a set of representative research problems in services computing, such as service selection, service
composition, service recommendation, and service quality prediction. An obvious fact is that
most services keep constant changes to timely adapt to changes of external business/technical
environment and changes of internal development strategies. However, traditional services computing
research does not consider such changes sufficiently. Many works regard services as \textit{static}
entities; this leads to the situation that some proposed models/algorithms do not work in real world.
Sensing various types of service changes is of great significance to the practicability and rationality
of services computing research. In this paper, a new research problem \textit{External Service
Sensing} (ESS) is defined to cope with various changes in services, and a research framework of ESS
is presented to elaborate the scope and boundary of ESS. This framework is composed of four orthogonal
dimensions: sensing objects, sensing contents, sensing channels, and sensing techniques. Each
concrete ESS problem is defined by combining different values in these dimensions, and existing
research work related to service changes can be well adapted to this framework. Real-world case
studies demonstrate the soundness of ESS and its framework. Finally, some challenges and opportunities
in ESS research are listed for researchers in the services computing community. To the best of our
knowledge, this is the first time to systematically define service change-related research as
a standard services computing problem, and thus broadening the research scope of services computing.

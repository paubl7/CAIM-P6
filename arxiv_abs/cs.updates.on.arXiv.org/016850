Understanding player strategies is a key question when analyzing player behavior both for academic
researchers and industry practitioners. For game designers and game user researchers, it is important
to gauge the distance between intended strategies and emergent strategies; this comparison allows
identification of glitches or undesirable behaviors. For academic researchers using games for
serious purposes such as education, the strategies adopted by players are indicative of their cognitive
progress in relation to serious goals, such as learning process. Current techniques and systems
created to address these needs present a few drawbacks. Qualitative methods are difficult to scale
upwards to include large number of players and are prone to subjective biases. Other approaches
such as visualization and analytical tools are either designed to provide an aggregated overview
of the data, losing the nuances of individual player behaviors, or, in the attempt of accounting
for individual behavior, are not specifically designed to reduce the visual cognitive load. In
this work, we propose a novel visualization technique that specifically addresses the tasks of
comparing behavior sequences in order to capture an overview of the strategies enacted by players
and at the same time examine individual player behaviors to identify differences and outliers.
This approach allows users to form hypotheses about player strategies and verify them. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of the technique through a case study: utilizing a prototype system to investigate
data collected from a commercial educational puzzle game. While the prototype's usability can
be improved, initial testing results show that core features of the system proved useful to our potential
users for understanding player strategies.

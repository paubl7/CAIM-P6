This paper illustrates an application of machine learning (ML) within a complex system that performs
grade estimation. In surface mining, assay measurements taken from production drilling often
provide rich information that allows initially inaccurate surfaces created using sparse exploration
data to be revised and subsequently improved. Recently, a Bayesian warping technique has been proposed
to reshape modeled surfaces based on geochemical and spatial constraints imposed by newly acquired
blasthole data. This paper focuses on incorporating machine learning in this warping framework
to make the likelihood computation generalizable. The technique works by adjusting the position
of vertices on the surface to maximize the integrity of modeled geological boundaries with respect
to sparse geochemical observations. Its foundation is laid by a Bayesian derivation in which the
geological domain likelihood given the chemistry, p(g|c), plays a similar role to p(y(c)|g). This
observation allows a manually calibrated process centered around the latter to be automated since
ML techniques may be used to estimate the former in a data-driven way. Machine learning performance
is evaluated for gradient boosting, neural network, random forest and other classifiers in a binary
and multi-class context using precision and recall rates. Once ML likelihood estimators are integrated
in the surface warping framework, surface shaping performance is evaluated using unseen data by
examining the categorical distribution of test samples located above and below the warped surface.
Large-scale validation experiments are performed to assess the overall efficacy of ML assisted
surface warping as a fully integrated component within an ore grade estimation system where the
posterior mean is obtained via Gaussian Process inference with a Matern 3/2 kernel.

This paper studies the economics of carbon-neutral synthetic fuel production from renewable electricity
in remote areas where high-quality renewable resources are abundant. To this end, a graph-based
optimisation modelling framework directly applicable to the strategic planning of remote renewable
energy supply chains is proposed. More precisely, a graph abstraction of planning problems is introduced,
wherein nodes can be viewed as optimisation subproblems with their own parameters, variables,
constraints and local objective, and typically represent a subsystem such as a technology, a plant
or a process. Edges, on the other hand, express the connectivity between subsystems. The framework
is leveraged to study the economics of carbon-neutral synthetic methane production from solar
and wind energy in North Africa and its delivery to Northwestern European markets. The full supply
chain is modelled in an integrated fashion, which makes it possible to accurately capture the interaction
between various technologies on hourly time scales. Results suggest that the cost of synthetic
methane production and delivery would be slightly under 200 \euro/MWh and 150 \euro/MWh by 2030
for a system supplying 100 TWh (higher heating value) annually that relies on solar photovoltaic
plants alone and a combination of solar photovoltaic and wind power plants, respectively, assuming
a uniform weighted average cost of capital of 7\%. The cost difference between these system configurations
mostly stems from higher investments in technologies providing flexibility required to balance
the system in the solar-driven configuration. Synthetic methane costs would drop to roughly 124
\euro/MWh and 87 \euro/MWh, respectively, if financing costs were zero and only technology costs
were taken into account. Prospects for cost reductions are also discussed, and options that would
enable such reductions are reviewed.

On any given day, tens of millions of people find themselves trapped in instances of modern slavery.
The terms "human trafficking," "trafficking in persons," and "modern slavery" are sometimes used
interchangeably to refer to both sex trafficking and forced labor. Human trafficking occurs when
a trafficker compels someone to provide labor or services through the use of force, fraud, and/or
coercion. The wide range of stakeholders in human trafficking presents major challenges. Direct
stakeholders are law enforcement, NGOs and INGOs, businesses, local/planning government authorities,
and survivors. Viewed from a very high level, all stakeholders share in a rich network of interactions
that produce and consume enormous amounts of information. The problems of making efficient use
of such information for the purposes of fighting trafficking while at the same time adhering to community
standards of privacy and ethics are formidable. At the same time they help us, technologies that
increase surveillance of populations can also undermine basic human rights. In early March 2020,
the Computing Community Consortium (CCC), in collaboration with the Code 8.7 Initiative, brought
together over fifty members of the computing research community along with anti-slavery practitioners
and survivors to lay out a research roadmap. The primary goal was to explore ways in which long-range
research in artificial intelligence (AI) could be applied to the fight against human trafficking.
Building on the kickoff Code 8.7 conference held at the headquarters of the United Nations in February
2019, the focus for this workshop was to link the ambitious goals outlined in the A 20-Year Community
Roadmap for Artificial Intelligence Research in the US (AI Roadmap) to challenges vital in achieving
the UN's Sustainable Development Goal Target 8.7, the elimination of modern slavery.

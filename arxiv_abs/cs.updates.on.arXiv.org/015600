The introduction of Physics-informed Neural Networks (PINNs) has led to an increased interest
in deep neural networks as universal approximators of PDEs in the solid mechanics community. Recently,
the Deep Energy Method (DEM) has been proposed. DEM is based on energy minimization principles,
contrary to PINN which is based on the residual of the PDEs. A significant advantage of DEM, is that
it requires the approximation of lower order derivatives compared to formulations that are based
on strong form residuals. However both DEM and classical PINN formulations struggle to resolve
fine features of the stress and displacement fields, for example concentration features in solid
mechanics applications. We propose an extension to the Deep Energy Method (DEM) to resolve these
features for finite strain hyperelasticity. The developed framework termed mixed Deep Energy
Method (mDEM) introduces stress measures as an additional output of the NN to the recently introduced
pure displacement formulation. Using this approach, Neumann boundary conditions are approximated
more accurately and the accuracy around spatial features which are typically responsible for high
concentrations is increased. In order to make the proposed approach more versatile, we introduce
a numerical integration scheme based on Delaunay integration, which enables the mDEM framework
to be used for random training point position sets commonly needed for computational domains with
stress concentrations. We highlight the advantages of the proposed approach while showing the
shortcomings of classical PINN and DEM formulations. The method is offering comparable results
to Finite-Element Method (FEM) on the forward calculation of challenging computational experiments
involving domains with fine geometric features and concentrated loads.

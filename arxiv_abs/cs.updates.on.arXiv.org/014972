RFID tags see a widespread use in modern security systems, including home intercoms, access control
cards, etc. Here we focus on access control systems. Currently they have either high cost or low security
guarantees. Hence, the developments focusing on improving access control security while lowering
the cost is a rapidly developing field. The purpose of this work is to create an alternative access
control scheme, where card scanners are replaced with passive RFID tags, and all the communications
are done via user's smartphone Wi-Fi. Based on the analysis of existing approaches, it was concluded
that use of mobile systems is the most promising due to their expandability and presence of a large
number of sensors, such as NFC, camera etc. In the proposed model RFID tags are mounted near a turnstile
or a smart door. Tag reading and programming is done via NFC chip directly on an Android or iOS mobile
device, which allows for a significant price cut for such a system implementation. A detailed description
of a tag writing procedure with the data required to perform it is provided. To enhance security,
together with smartphone-based authorization we require the user to provide his photograph while
entering a secure gate. The photograph is then displayed on a monitoring dashboard side-by-side
with his registration picture, so that the two can then be matched against each other. The developed
client-server application offers administrative system used to configure gate access policies
and monitor entrances with filters by access time, user and gate. Also, we propose a mobile application
that allows gate registration and serves as a door unlock key. The suggested access control model
reduces installation costs required, as it is fully wireless and uses cheap autonomous RFID-tags
as its main component.

The discovery of disease biomarkers from gene expression data has been greatly advanced by feature
selection (FS) methods, especially using ensemble FS (EFS) strategies with perturbation at the
data level (i.e., homogeneous, Hom-EFS) or method level (i.e., heterogeneous, Het-EFS). Here
we proposed a Hybrid EFS (Hyb-EFS) design that explores both types of perturbation to improve the
stability and the predictive power of candidate biomarkers. With this, Hyb-EFS aims to disrupt
associations of good performance with a single dataset, single algorithm, or a specific combination
of both, which is particularly interesting for better reproducibility of genomic biomarkers.
We investigated the adequacy of our approach for microarray data related to four types of cancer,
carrying out an extensive comparison with other ensemble and single FS approaches. Five FS methods
were used in our experiments: Wx, Symmetrical Uncertainty (SU), Gain Ratio (GR), Characteristic
Direction (GeoDE), and ReliefF. We observed that the Hyb-EFS and Het-EFS approaches attenuated
the large performance variation observed for most single FS and Hom-EFS across distinct datasets.
Also, the Hyb-EFS improved upon the stability of the Het-EFS within our domain. Comparing the Hyb-EFS
and Het-EFS composed of the top-performing selectors (Wx, GR, and SU), our hybrid approach surpassed
the equivalent heterogeneous design and the best Hom-EFS (Hom-Wx). Interestingly, the rankings
produced by our Hyb-EFS reached greater biological plausibility, with a notably high enrichment
for cancer-related genes and pathways. Thus, our experiments suggest the potential of the proposed
Hybrid EFS design in discovering candidate biomarkers from microarray data. Finally, we provide
an open-source framework to support similar analyses in other domains, both as a user-friendly
application and a plain Python package.

Sender-receiver interactions, and specifically persuasion games, are widely researched in economic
modeling and artificial intelligence, and serve as a solid foundation for powerful applications.
However, in the classic persuasion games setting, the messages sent from the expert to the decision-maker
are abstract or well-structured application-specific signals rather than natural (human) language
messages, although natural language is a very common communication signal in real-world persuasion
setups. This paper addresses the use of natural language in persuasion games, exploring its impact
on the decisions made by the players and aiming to construct effective models for the prediction
of these decisions. For this purpose, we conduct an online repeated interaction experiment. At
each trial of the interaction, an informed expert aims to sell an uninformed decision-maker a vacation
in a hotel, by sending her a review that describes the hotel. While the expert is exposed to several
scored reviews, the decision-maker observes only the single review sent by the expert, and her payoff
in case she chooses to take the hotel is a random draw from the review score distribution available
to the expert only. The expert's payoff, in turn, depends on the number of times the decision-maker
chooses the hotel. We consider a number of modeling approaches for this setup, differing from each
other in the model type (deep neural network (DNN) vs. linear classifier), the type of features used
by the model (textual, behavioral or both) and the source of the textual features (DNN-based vs.
hand-crafted). Our results demonstrate that given a prefix of the interaction sequence, our models
can predict the future decisions of the decision-maker, particularly when a sequential modeling
approach and hand-crafted textual features are applied.

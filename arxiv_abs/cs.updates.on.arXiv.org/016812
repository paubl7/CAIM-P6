Side-channel attacks extracting sensitive data from implementations have been considered a major
threat to the security of cryptographic schemes. This has elevated the need for improved designs
by embodying countermeasures, with masking being the most prominent example. To formally verify
the security of a masking scheme, numerous attack models have been developed to capture the physical
properties of the information leakage as well as the capabilities of the adversary. With regard
to these models, extensive research has been performed to realize masking schemes. These research
efforts have led to significant progress in the development of security assessment methodologies
and further initiated standardization activities. However, since the majority of this work is
theoretical, it is challenging for the more practice-oriented hardware security community to
fully grasp and contribute to. To bridge the gap, these advancements are reviewed and discussed
in this survey, mainly from the perspective of hardware security. In doing so, a clear taxonomy is
provided that is helpful for a systematic treatment of the masking-related topics. By giving an
extensive overview of the existing methods, this survey (1) provides a research landscape of circuit
masking for newcomers to the field, (2) offers guidelines on which attack model and verification
tool to choose when designing masking schemes, and (3) identifies interesting new research directions
where masking models and assessment tools can be applied. Thus, this survey serves as an essential
reference for hardware security practitioners interested in the theory behind masking techniques,
the tools useful to verify the security of masked circuits, and their potential applications.

Machine learning (ML)-based network intrusion detection system (NIDS) plays a critical role in
discovering unknown and novel threats in a large-scale cyberspace. It has been widely adopted as
a mainstream hunting method in many organizations, such as financial institutes, manufacturing
companies and government agencies. However, there are two challenging issues in the existing designs:
1) achieving excellent performance of threat detection is often at the cost of a large number of false
positives, leading to the problem of alert fatigue and 2) the interpretability of detection results
is low, making it difficult for the security analyst to obtain the insight of threats and take promptly
actions against the attacks. To tackle the above issues, in this paper we propose a defense mechanism,
DarkHunter, that includes three parts: stream processor, detection engine and incident analyzer.
The stream processor converts raw network packet streams into data records of a set of statistical
features that can be effectively used for learning; The detection engine leverages an efficient
ensemble neural network (EnsembleNet) to identify anomalous network traffic; The incident analyzer
applies a correlation analysis to filter out the mis-predictions from EnsembleNet, traces each
detected threat from its statistical representation back to its source traffic flow to enhance
its intelligibility and prioritizes the threats to be responded to minimize security risks. Our
evaluations, based on the UNSW-NB15 testbed, show that DarkHunter significantly outperforms
state-of-the-art ML-based NIDS designs by achieving higher accuracy, higher detection rate,
higher precision, higher F1 score while keeping lower false alarm rate.

Aggregators have emerged as crucial tools for the coordination of distributed, controllable loads.
To be used effectively, an aggregator must be able to communicate the available flexibility of the
loads they control, as known as the aggregate flexibility to a system operator. However, most of
existing aggregate flexibility measures often are slow-timescale estimations and much less attention
has been paid to real-time coordination between an aggregator and a system operator to allow the
system operator to send control signals to the aggregator that lead to optimization of system-level
objectives, such as online cost minimization, and do not violate private constraints of the loads,
such as satisfying specific load demands. In this paper, we present a design of real-time aggregate
flexibility feedback based on maximization of entropy, termed the maximum entropy feedback (MEF).
The design provides a concise and informative signal that can be used by the system operator to perform
online cost minimization, while provably satisfying the constraints of the loads. In addition
to deriving analytic properties of the MEF, we show that it can be generated efficiently using reinforcement
learning and used as a penalty term in model predictive control (MPC), which gives a novel algorithm
-- the penalized predictive control (PPC). The benefits of the PPC are (1). Efficient Communication.
An operator running PPC does not need to know the exact states and constraints of the loads on the aggregator's
side, but only the MEF sent by the aggregator. (2). Fast Computation. The PPC is an unconstrained
online optimization and it often has much less number of variables than the optimization formulation
of an MPC. (3). Lower Costs. We illustrate the efficacy of the PPC using a dataset from an adaptive
electric vehicle charging network and show that PPC outperforms classical MPC by achieving lower
costs.

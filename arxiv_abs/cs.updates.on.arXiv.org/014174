We present a non-intrusive model reduction framework for linear poroelasticity problems in heterogeneous
porous media using proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and neural networks, based on the usual
offline-online paradigm. As the conductivity of porous media can be highly heterogeneous and span
several orders of magnitude, we utilize the interior penalty discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method
as a full order solver to handle discontinuity and ensure local mass conservation during the offline
stage. We then use POD as a data compression tool and compare the nested POD technique, in which time
and uncertain parameter domains are compressed consecutively, to the classical POD method in which
all domains are compressed simultaneously. The neural networks are finally trained to map the set
of uncertain parameters, which could correspond to material properties, boundary conditions,
or geometric characteristics, to the collection of coefficients calculated from an $L^2$ projection
over the reduced basis. We then perform a non-intrusive evaluation of the neural networks to obtain
coefficients corresponding to new values of the uncertain parameters during the online stage.
We show that our framework provides reasonable approximations of the DG solution, but it is significantly
faster. Moreover, the reduced order framework can capture sharp discontinuities of both displacement
and pressure fields resulting from the heterogeneity in the media conductivity, which is generally
challenging for intrusive reduced order methods. The sources of error are presented, showing that
the nested POD technique is computationally advantageous and still provides comparable accuracy
to the classical POD method. We also explore the effect of different choices of the hyperparameters
of the neural network on the framework performance.

Magnetic surveys are conventionally performed by scanning a domain with a portable scalar magnetic
sensor. Unfortunately, scalar magnetometers are expensive, power consuming and bulky. In many
applications, calibrated vector magnetometers can be used to perform magnetic surveys. In recent
years algorithms based on artificial intelligence (AI) achieve state-of-the-art results in many
modern applications. In this work we investigate an AI algorithm for the classical scalar calibration
of magnetometers. A simple, low cost method for performing a magnetic survey is presented. The method
utilizes a low power consumption sensor with an AI calibration procedure that improves the common
calibration methods and suggests an alternative to the conventional technology and algorithms.
The setup of the survey system is optimized for quick deployment in-situ right before performing
the magnetic survey. We present a calibration method based on a procedure of rotating the sensor
in the natural earth magnetic field for an optimal time period. This technique can deal with a constant
field offset and non-orthogonality issues and does not require any external reference. The calibration
is done by finding an estimator that yields the calibration parameters and produces the best geometric
fit to the sensor readings. A comprehensive model considering the physical, algorithmic and hardware
properties of the magnetometer of the survey system is presented. The geometric ellipsoid fitting
approach is parametrically tested. The calibration procedure reduced the root-mean-squared
noise from the order of 104 nT to less than 10 nT with variance lower than 1 nT in a complete 360 degrees
rotation in the natural earth magnetic field.

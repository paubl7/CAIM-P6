Disease prediction is a well-known classification problem in medical applications. Graph neural
networks provide a powerful tool for analyzing the patients' features relative to each other. Recently,
Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) have particularly been studied in the field of disease prediction.
Due to the nature of such medical datasets, the class imbalance is a familiar issue in the field of
disease prediction. When the class imbalance is present in the data, the existing graph-based classifiers
tend to be biased towards the major class(es). Meanwhile, the correct diagnosis of the rare true-positive
cases among all the patients is vital. In conventional methods, such imbalance is tackled by assigning
appropriate weights to classes in the loss function; however, this solution is still dependent
on the relative values of weights, sensitive to outliers, and in some cases biased towards the minor
class(es). In this paper, we propose Re-weighted Adversarial Graph Convolutional Network (RA-GCN)
to enhance the performance of the graph-based classifier and prevent it from emphasizing the samples
of any particular class. This is accomplished by automatically learning to weigh the samples of
the classes. For this purpose, a graph-based network is associated with each class, which is responsible
for weighing the class samples and informing the classifier about the importance of each sample.
Therefore, the classifier adjusts itself and determines the boundary between classes with more
attention to the important samples. The parameters of the classifier and weighing networks are
trained by an adversarial approach. At the end of the adversarial training process, the boundary
of the classifier is more accurate and unbiased. We show the superiority of RA-GCN on synthetic and
three publicly available medical datasets compared to the recent method.

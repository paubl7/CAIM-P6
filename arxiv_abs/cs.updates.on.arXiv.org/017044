Circadian and other physiological rhythms play a key role in both normal homeostasis and disease
processes. Such is the case of circadian and infradian seizure patterns observed in epilepsy. However,
these rhythms are not fully exploited in the design of active implantable medical devices. In this
paper we explore a new implantable stimulator that implements chronotherapy as a feedforward input
to supplement both open-loop and closed-loop methods. This integrated algorithm allows for stimulation
to be adjusted to the ultradian, circadian, and infradian patterns observed in patients through
slowly-varying temporal adjustments of stimulation and algorithm sub-components, while also
enabling adaption of stimulation based on immediate physiological needs such as a breakthrough
seizure or change of posture. Embedded physiological sensors in the stimulator can be used to refine
the baseline stimulation circadian pattern as a "digital zeitgeber". This algorithmic approach
is tested on a canine with severe drug-resistant idiopathic generalized epilepsy exhibiting a
characteristic diurnal pattern correlated with sleep-wake cycles. Prior to implantation, the
canine's cluster seizures evolved to status epilepticus (SE) and required emergency pharmacological
intervention. The cranially-mounted system was fully-implanted bilaterally into the centromedian
nucleus of the thalamus. Using combinations of time-based modulation, thalamocortical rhythm-specific
tuning of frequency parameters, and fast-adaptive modes based on activity, the canine has experienced
no further SE events post-implant at the time of writing (7 months), and no significant clusters
are observed any longer. The use of digitally-enabled chronotherapy as a feedforward signal to
augment adaptive neurostimulators could prove a useful algorithmic method where sensitivity
to temporal patterns are characteristics of the disease state.

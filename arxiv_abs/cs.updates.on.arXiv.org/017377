The implementation of deep learning based computer aided diagnosis systems for the classification
of mammogram images can help in improving the accuracy, reliability, and cost of diagnosing patients.
However, training a deep learning model requires a considerable amount of labeled images, which
can be expensive to obtain as time and effort from clinical practitioners is required. A number of
publicly available datasets have been built with data from different hospitals and clinics. However,
using models trained on these datasets for later work on images sampled from a different hospital
or clinic might result in lower performance. This is due to the distribution mismatch of the datasets,
which include different patient populations and image acquisition protocols. The scarcity of
labeled data can also bring a challenge towards the application of transfer learning with models
trained using these source datasets. In this work, a real world scenario is evaluated where a novel
target dataset sampled from a private Costa Rican clinic is used, with few labels and heavily imbalanced
data. The use of two popular and publicly available datasets (INbreast and CBIS-DDSM) as source
data, to train and test the models on the novel target dataset, is evaluated. The use of the semi-supervised
deep learning approach known as MixMatch, to leverage the usage of unlabeled data from the target
dataset, is proposed and evaluated. In the tests, the performance of models is extensively measured,
using different metrics to assess the performance of a classifier under heavy data imbalance conditions.
It is shown that the use of semi-supervised deep learning combined with fine-tuning can provide
a meaningful advantage when using scarce labeled observations. We make available the novel dataset
for the benefit of the community.

Currently, Coronavirus disease (COVID-19), one of the most infectious diseases in the 21st century,
is diagnosed using RT-PCR testing, CT scans and/or Chest X-Ray (CXR) images. CT (Computed Tomography)
scanners and RT-PCR testing are not available in most medical centers and hence in many cases CXR
images become the most time/cost effective tool for assisting clinicians in making decisions.
Deep learning neural networks have a great potential for building COVID-19 triage systems and detecting
COVID-19 patients, especially patients with low severity. Unfortunately, current databases
do not allow building such systems as they are highly heterogeneous and biased towards severe cases.
This paper is three-fold: (i) we demystify the high sensitivities achieved by most recent COVID-19
classification models, (ii) under a close collaboration with Hospital Universitario Cl\'inico
San Cecilio, Granada, Spain, we built COVIDGR-1.0, a homogeneous and balanced database that includes
all levels of severity, from normal with Positive RT-PCR, Mild, Moderate to Severe. COVIDGR-1.0
contains 426 positive and 426 negative PA (PosteroAnterior) CXR views and (iii) we propose COVID
Smart Data based Network (COVID-SDNet) methodology for improving the generalization capacity
of COVID-classification models. Our approach reaches good and stable results with an accuracy
of $97.72\% \pm 0.95 \%$, $86.90\% \pm 3.20\%$, $61.80\% \pm 5.49\%$ in severe, moderate and mild
COVID-19 severity levels\footnote{Paper accepted for publication in Journal of Biomedical and
Health Informatics}. Our approach could help in the early detection of COVID-19. COVIDGR-1.0 along
with the severity level labels are available to the scientific community through this link https://dasci.es/es/transferencia/open-data/covidgr/.

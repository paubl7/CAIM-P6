We develop a new Bayesian framework based on deep neural networks to be able to extrapolate in space-time
using historical data and to quantify uncertainties arising from both noisy and gappy data in physical
problems. Specifically, the proposed approach has two stages: (1) prior learning and (2) posterior
estimation. At the first stage, we employ the physics-informed Generative Adversarial Networks
(PI-GAN) to learn a functional prior either from a prescribed function distribution, e.g., Gaussian
process, or from historical data and physics. At the second stage, we employ the Hamiltonian Monte
Carlo (HMC) method to estimate the posterior in the latent space of PI-GANs. In addition, we use two
different approaches to encode the physics: (1) automatic differentiation, used in the physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs) for scenarios with explicitly known partial differential equations (PDEs),
and (2) operator regression using the deep operator network (DeepONet) for PDE-agnostic scenarios.
We then test the proposed method for (1) meta-learning for one-dimensional regression, and forward/inverse
PDE problems (combined with PINNs); (2) PDE-agnostic physical problems (combined with DeepONet),
e.g., fractional diffusion as well as saturated stochastic (100-dimensional) flows in heterogeneous
porous media; and (3) spatial-temporal regression problems, i.e., inference of a marine riser
displacement field. The results demonstrate that the proposed approach can provide accurate predictions
as well as uncertainty quantification given very limited scattered and noisy data, since historical
data could be available to provide informative priors. In summary, the proposed method is capable
of learning flexible functional priors, and can be extended to big data problems using stochastic
HMC or normalizing flows since the latent space is generally characterized as low dimensional.

We prove several tight results on the fine-grained complexity of approximating the diameter of
a graph. First, we prove that, for any $\varepsilon>0$, assuming the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis
(SETH), there are no near-linear time $2-\varepsilon$-approximation algorithms for the Diameter
of a sparse directed graph, even in unweighted graphs. This result shows that a simple near-linear
time 2-approximation algorithm for Diameter is optimal under SETH, answering a question from a
survey of Rubinstein and Vassilevska-Williams (SIGACT '19) for the case of directed graphs. In
the same survey, Rubinstein and Vassilevska-Williams also asked if it is possible to show that there
are no $2-\varepsilon$ approximation algorithms for Diameter in a directed graph in $O(n^{1.499})$
time. We show that, assuming a hypothesis called NSETH, one cannot use a deterministic SETH-based
reduction to rule out the existence of such algorithms. Furthermore, assuming another hypothesis
called Non-Uniform NSETH (NUNSETH), one cannot use a even a randomized SETH-based reduction to
rule out the existence of such algorithms. Extending the techniques in these two results, we characterize
whether a $2-\varepsilon$ approximation algorithm running in time $O(n^{1+\delta})$ for the
Diameter of a sparse directed unweighted graph can be ruled out by a deterministic SETH-based reduction
for every $\delta\in(0,1)$ and essentially every $\varepsilon\in(0,1)$, assuming NSETH. We
make the same characterization for randomized SETH-based reductions, assuming NUNSETH. This
settles the SETH-hardness of approximating the diameter of sparse directed unweighted graphs
for deterministic reductions, up to NSETH, and for randomized reductions, up to NUNSETH. We prove
additional hardness and non-reducibility results for undirected graphs.

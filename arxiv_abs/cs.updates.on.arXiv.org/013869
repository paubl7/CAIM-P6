Current emotion detection classifiers predict discrete emotions. However, literature in psychology
has documented that compound and ambiguous facial expressions are often evoked by humans. As a stride
towards development of machine learning models that more accurately reflect compound and ambiguous
emotions, we replace traditional one-hot encoded label representations with a crowd's distribution
of labels. We center our study on the Child Affective Facial Expression (CAFE) dataset, a gold standard
dataset of pediatric facial expressions which includes 100 human labels per image. We first acquire
crowdsourced labels for 207 emotions from CAFE and demonstrate that the consensus labels from the
crowd tend to match the consensus from the original CAFE raters, validating the utility of crowdsourcing.
We then train two versions of a ResNet-152 classifier on CAFE images with two types of labels (1) traditional
one-hot encoding and (2) vector labels representing the crowd distribution of responses. We compare
the resulting output distributions of the two classifiers. While the traditional F1-score for
the one-hot encoding classifier is much higher (94.33% vs. 78.68%), the output probability vector
of the crowd-trained classifier much more closely resembles the distribution of human labels (t=3.2827,
p=0.0014). For many applications of affective computing, reporting an emotion probability distribution
that more closely resembles human interpretation can be more important than traditional machine
learning metrics. This work is a first step for engineers of interactive systems to account for machine
learning cases with ambiguous classes and we hope it will generate a discussion about machine learning
with ambiguous labels and leveraging crowdsourcing as a potential solution.

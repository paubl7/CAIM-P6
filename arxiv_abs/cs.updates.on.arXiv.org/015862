Artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed a substantial breakthrough in a variety of Internet
of Things (IoT) applications and services, spanning from recommendation systems to robotics control
and military surveillance. This is driven by the easier access to sensory data and the enormous scale
of pervasive/ubiquitous devices that generate zettabytes (ZB) of real-time data streams. Designing
accurate models using such data streams, to predict future insights and revolutionize the decision-taking
process, inaugurates pervasive systems as a worthy paradigm for a better quality-of-life. The
confluence of pervasive computing and artificial intelligence, Pervasive AI, expanded the role
of ubiquitous IoT systems from mainly data collection to executing distributed computations with
a promising alternative to centralized learning, presenting various challenges. In this context,
a wise cooperation and resource scheduling should be envisaged among IoT devices (e.g., smartphones,
smart vehicles) and infrastructure (e.g. edge nodes, and base stations) to avoid communication
and computation overheads and ensure maximum performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive
survey of the recent techniques developed to overcome these resource challenges in pervasive AI
systems. Specifically, we first present an overview of the pervasive computing, its architecture,
and its intersection with artificial intelligence. We then review the background, applications
and performance metrics of AI, particularly Deep Learning (DL) and online learning, running in
a ubiquitous system. Next, we provide a deep literature review of communication-efficient techniques,
from both algorithmic and system perspectives, of distributed inference, training and online
learning tasks across the combination of IoT devices, edge devices and cloud servers. Finally,
we discuss our future vision and research challenges.

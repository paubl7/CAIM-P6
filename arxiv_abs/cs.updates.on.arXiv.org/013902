Deep learning based face recognition has achieved significant progress in recent years. Yet, the
practical model production and further research of deep face recognition are in great need of corresponding
public support. For example, the production of face representation network desires a modular training
scheme to consider the proper choice from various candidates of state-of-the-art backbone and
training supervision subject to the real-world face recognition demand; for performance analysis
and comparison, the standard and automatic evaluation with a bunch of models on multiple benchmarks
will be a desired tool as well; besides, a public groundwork is welcomed for deploying the face recognition
in the shape of holistic pipeline. Furthermore, there are some newly-emerged challenges, such
as the masked face recognition caused by the recent world-wide COVID-19 pandemic, which draws increasing
attention in practical applications. A feasible and elegant solution is to build an easy-to-use
unified framework to meet the above demands. To this end, we introduce a novel open-source framework,
named FaceX-Zoo, which is oriented to the research-development community of face recognition.
Resorting to the highly modular and scalable design, FaceX-Zoo provides a training module with
various supervisory heads and backbones towards state-of-the-art face recognition, as well as
a standardized evaluation module which enables to evaluate the models in most of the popular benchmarks
just by editing a simple configuration. Also, a simple yet fully functional face SDK is provided
for the validation and primary application of the trained models. Rather than including as many
as possible of the prior techniques, we enable FaceX-Zoo to easily upgrade and extend along with
the development of face related domains. The source code and models are available at https://github.com/JDAI-CV/FaceX-Zoo.

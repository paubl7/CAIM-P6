Pulmonary fibrosis is a devastating chronic lung disease that causes irreparable lung tissue scarring
and damage, resulting in progressive loss in lung capacity and has no known cure. A critical step
in the treatment and management of pulmonary fibrosis is the assessment of lung function decline,
with computed tomography (CT) imaging being a particularly effective method for determining the
extent of lung damage caused by pulmonary fibrosis. Motivated by this, we introduce Fibrosis-Net,
a deep convolutional neural network design tailored for the prediction of pulmonary fibrosis progression
from chest CT images. More specifically, machine-driven design exploration was leveraged to determine
a strong architectural design for CT lung analysis, upon which we build a customized network design
tailored for predicting forced vital capacity (FVC) based on a patient's CT scan, initial spirometry
measurement, and clinical metadata. Finally, we leverage an explainability-driven performance
validation strategy to study the decision-making behaviour of Fibrosis-Net as to verify that predictions
are based on relevant visual indicators in CT images. Experiments using the OSIC Pulmonary Fibrosis
Progression Challenge benchmark dataset showed that the proposed Fibrosis-Net is able to achieve
a significantly higher modified Laplace Log Likelihood score than the winning solutions on the
challenge leaderboard. Furthermore, explainability-driven performance validation demonstrated
that the proposed Fibrosis-Net exhibits correct decision-making behaviour by leveraging clinically-relevant
visual indicators in CT images when making predictions on pulmonary fibrosis progress. While Fibrosis-Net
is not yet a production-ready clinical assessment solution, we hope that releasing the model in
open source manner will encourage researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike
to leverage and build upon it.

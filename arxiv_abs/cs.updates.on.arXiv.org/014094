We propose a novel framework to learn the spatiotemporal variability in longitudinal 3D shape data
sets, which contain observations of subjects that evolve and deform over time. This problem is challenging
since surfaces come with arbitrary spatial and temporal parameterizations. Thus, they need to
be spatially registered and temporally aligned onto each other. We solve this spatiotemporal registration
problem using a Riemannian approach. We treat a 3D surface as a point in a shape space equipped with
an elastic metric that measures the amount of bending and stretching that the surfaces undergo.
A 4D surface can then be seen as a trajectory in this space. With this formulation, the statistical
analysis of 4D surfaces becomes the problem of analyzing trajectories embedded in a nonlinear Riemannian
manifold. However, computing spatiotemporal registration and statistics on nonlinear spaces
relies on complex nonlinear optimizations. Our core contribution is the mapping of the surfaces
to the space of Square-Root Normal Fields (SRNF) where the L2 metric is equivalent to the partial
elastic metric in the space of surfaces. By solving the spatial registration in the SRNF space, analyzing
4D surfaces becomes the problem of analyzing trajectories embedded in the SRNF space, which is Euclidean.
Here, we develop the building blocks that enable such analysis. These include the spatiotemporal
registration of arbitrarily parameterized 4D surfaces even in the presence of large elastic deformations
and large variations in their execution rates, the computation of geodesics between 4D surfaces,
the computation of statistical summaries, such as means and modes of variation, and the synthesis
of random 4D surfaces. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework using 4D facial
surfaces and 4D human body shapes.

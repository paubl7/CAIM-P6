We present the extension of the Tinker-HP package (Lagard\`ere et al., Chem. Sci., 2018,9, 956-972)
to the use of Graphics Processing Unit (GPU) cards to accelerate molecular dynamics simulations
using polarizable many-body force fields. The new high-performance module allows for an efficient
use of single- and multi-GPU architectures ranging from research laboratories to modern pre-exascale
supercomputer centers. After detailing an analysis of our general scalable strategy that relies
on OpenACC and CUDA, we discuss the various capabilities of the package. Among them, the multi-precision
possibilities of the code are discussed. If an efficient double precision implementation is provided
to preserve the possibility of fast reference computations, we show that a lower precision arithmetic
is preferred providing a similar accuracy for molecular dynamics while exhibiting superior performances.
As Tinker-HP is mainly dedicated to accelerate simulations using new generation point dipole polarizable
force field, we focus our study on the implementation of the AMOEBA model and provide illustrative
benchmarks of the code for single- and multi-cards simulations on large biosystems encompassing
up to millions of atoms.The new code strongly reduces time to solution and offers the best performances
ever obtained using the AMOEBA polarizable force field. Perspectives toward the strong-scaling
performance of our multi-node massive parallelization strategy, unsupervised adaptive sampling
and large scale applicability of the Tinker-HP code in biophysics are discussed. The present software
has been released in phase advance on GitHub in link with the High Performance Computing community
COVID-19 research efforts and is free for Academics (see https://github.com/TinkerTools/tinker-hp).

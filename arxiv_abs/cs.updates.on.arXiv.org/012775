The recent advancement in real-world critical infrastructure networks has led to an exponential
growth in the use of automated devices which in turn has created new security challenges. In this
paper, we study the robust and adaptive maximum flow problem in an uncertain environment where the
network parameters (e.g., capacities) are known and deterministic, but the network structure
(e.g., edges) is vulnerable to adversarial attacks or failures. We propose a robust and sustainable
network flow model to effectively and proactively counter plausible attacking behaviors of an
adversary operating under a budget constraint. Specifically, we introduce a novel scenario generation
approach based on an iterative two-player game between a defender and an adversary. We assume that
the adversary always takes a best myopic response (out of some feasible attacks) against the current
flow scenario prepared by the defender. On the other hand, we assume that the defender considers
all the attacking behaviors revealed by the adversary in previous iterations in order to generate
a new conservative flow strategy that is robust (maximin) against all those attacks. This iterative
game continues until the objectives of the adversary and the administrator both converge. We show
that the robust network flow problem to be solved by the defender is NP-hard and that the complexity
of the adversary's decision problem grows exponentially with the network size and the adversary's
budget value. We propose two principled heuristic approaches for solving the adversary's problem
at the scale of a large urban network. Extensive computational results on multiple synthetic and
real-world data sets demonstrate that the solution provided by the defender's problem significantly
increases the amount of flow pushed through the network and reduces the expected lost flow over four
state-of-the-art benchmark approaches.

BPMN is a specification language widely used by industry and researchers for business process modeling
and execution. It defines clearly how to articulate its concepts, but do not provide mechanism to
represent the semantics of the produced models. This paper addresses the problem of how to improve
the expressiveness of BPMN models, proposing a definition for the semantics of a business process
within a BPMN model, and improving the completeness of the models in a systematic manner, so that
models can describe far more situations with few extra managed complexity. We conceive a framework
based on the business transaction patterns available in the enterprise ontology body of knowledge
to prescribe the foundations of semantic BPMN models. A tool has been developed to automate the framework.
Then, two industrial proof-of-concepts are used to measure its coverage, both positive and negative,
and to argue about our proposal's usefulness. After that, the proposal is compared with others using
a systematic literature review. A full BPMN pattern is proposed encompassing the happy flow, the
declinations, the rejections and the revocations, without adding any new element to the BPMN specification.
A software tool has been developed, and made publicly available, to support the automatic generation
of the BPMN models from the proposed patterns. Our semantified BPMN pattern allowed the identification
of a large amount of implicit, and other not implemented, situations in both proof-of-concepts.
It is concluded that the usage of a semantic solution, grounded on a sound pattern, allows the systematic
enrichment of the BPMN models with a bounded effort. Moreover, to simplify the BPMN executable models'
implementation, its elements could be classified as implicit, explicit, or not implemented yet.
Finally, related work indicates that this work is demanded, but no full solutions are available.

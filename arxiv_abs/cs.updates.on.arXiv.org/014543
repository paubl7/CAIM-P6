This work aims to analyse the predictability of price movements of cryptocurrencies on both hourly
and daily data observed from January 2017 to January 2021, using deep learning algorithms. For our
experiments, we used three sets of features: technical, trading and social media indicators, considering
a restricted model of only technical indicators and an unrestricted model with technical, trading
and social media indicators. We verified whether the consideration of trading and social media
indicators, along with the classic technical variables (such as price's returns), leads to a significative
improvement in the prediction of cryptocurrencies price's changes. We conducted the study on the
two highest cryptocurrencies in volume and value (at the time of the study): Bitcoin and Ethereum.
We implemented four different machine learning algorithms typically used in time-series classification
problems: Multi Layers Perceptron (MLP), Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short Term
Memory (LSTM) neural network and Attention Long Short Term Memory (ALSTM). We devised the experiments
using the advanced bootstrap technique to consider the variance problem on test samples, which
allowed us to evaluate a more reliable estimate of the model's performance. Furthermore, the Grid
Search technique was used to find the best hyperparameters values for each implemented algorithm.
The study shows that, based on the hourly frequency results, the unrestricted model outperforms
the restricted one. The addition of the trading indicators to the classic technical indicators
improves the accuracy of Bitcoin and Ethereum price's changes prediction, with an increase of accuracy
from a range of 51-55% for the restricted model, to 67-84% for the unrestricted model.

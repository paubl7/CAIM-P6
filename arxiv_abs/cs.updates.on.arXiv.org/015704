Query languages in general and SQL in particular are arguably one of the most successful programming
interfaces. Yet, in the domain of high-energy physics (HEP), they have found limited acceptance.
This is surprising since data analysis in HEP matches the SQL model well: it is fully structured data
queried using combinations of selections, projections, joins, and reductions. To gain insights
on why this is the case, in this paper we perform an exhaustive performance and functionality analysis
of several data processing platforms (Amazon Athena, Google Big Query, Presto, Rumble) and compare
them to the new RDataFrame interface of the ROOT framework, the most commonly used system by particle
physicists today. The goal of the analysis is to identify the potential advantages and shortcomings
of each system considering not only performance but also cost for cloud deployments, suitability
of the query dialect, and resulting query complexity. The analysis is done using a HEP workload:
the Analysis Description Languages (ADL) benchmark, created by physicists to capture representative
aspects of their data processing tasks. The evaluation of these systems results in an interesting
and rather complex picture of existing solutions: those offering the best possibilities in terms
of expressiveness, conciseness, and usability turn out to be the slowest and most expensive; the
fastest ones are not the most cost-efficient and involve complex queries; RDataFrame, the baseline
we use as a reference, is often faster and cheaper but is currently facing scalability issues with
large multi-core machines. In the paper, we analyze all the aspects that lead to such results and
discuss how systems should evolve to better support HEP workloads. In the process, we identify several
weaknesses of existing systems that should be relevant to a wide range of use cases beyond particle
physics.

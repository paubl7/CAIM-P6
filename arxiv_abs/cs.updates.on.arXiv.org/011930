Artificial Intelligence (AI) is being hailed as the latest example of a General Purpose Technology
that could transform productivity and help tackle important societal challenges. This outcome
is however not guaranteed: a myopic focus on short-term benefits could lock AI into technologies
that turn out to be sub-optimal in the longer-run. Recent controversies about the dominance of deep
learning methods and private labs in AI research suggest that the field may be getting narrower,
but the evidence base is lacking. We seek to address this gap with an analysis of the thematic diversity
of AI research in arXiv, a widely used pre-prints site. Having identified 110,000 AI papers in this
corpus, we use hierarchical topic modelling to estimate the thematic composition of AI research,
and this composition to calculate various metrics of research diversity. Our analysis suggests
that diversity in AI research has stagnated in recent years, and that AI research involving private
sector organisations tends to be less diverse than research in academia. This appears to be driven
by a small number of prolific and narrowly-focused technology companies. Diversity in academia
is bolstered by smaller institutions and research groups that may have less incentives to `race'
and lower levels of collaboration with the private sector. We also find that private sector AI researchers
tend to specialise in data and computationally intensive deep learning methods at the expense of
research involving other (symbolic and statistical) AI methods, and of research that considers
the societal and ethical implications of AI or applies it in domains like health. Our results suggest
that there may be a rationale for policy action to prevent a premature narrowing of AI research that
could reduce its societal benefits, but we note the incentive, information and scale hurdles standing
in the way of such interventions.

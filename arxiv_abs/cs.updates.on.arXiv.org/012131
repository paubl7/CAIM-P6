Influence maximization (IM) aims at maximizing the spread of influence by offering discounts to
influential users (called seeding). In many applications, due to user's privacy concern, overwhelming
network scale etc., it is hard to target any user in the network as one wishes. Instead, only a small
subset of users is initially accessible. Such access limitation would significantly impair the
influence spread, since IM often relies on seeding high degree users, which are particularly rare
in such a small subset due to the power-law structure of social networks. In this paper, we attempt
to solve the limited IM in real-world scenarios by the adaptive approach with seeding and diffusion
uncertainty considered. Specifically, we consider fine-grained discounts and assume users accept
the discount probabilistically. The diffusion process is depicted by the independent cascade
model. To overcome the access limitation, we prove the set-wise friendship paradox (FP) phenomenon
that neighbors have higher degree in expectation, and propose a two-stage seeding model with the
FP embedded, where neighbors are seeded. On this basis, for comparison we formulate the non-adaptive
case and adaptive case, both proven to be NP-hard. In the non-adaptive case, discounts are allocated
to users all at once. We show the monotonicity of influence spread w.r.t. discount allocation and
design a two-stage coordinate descent framework to decide the discount allocation. In the adaptive
case, users are sequentially seeded based on observations of existing seeding and diffusion results.
We prove the adaptive submodularity and submodularity of the influence spread function in two stages.
Then, a series of adaptive greedy algorithms are proposed with constant approximation ratio.

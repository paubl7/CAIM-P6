This work aims to analyse the predictability of price movements of cryptocurrencies on both hourly
and daily data observed from January 2017 to January 2021, using deep learning algorithms. For our
experiments, we used three sets of features: technical, trading and social media indicators, considering
a \textit{restricted model} of only technical indicators and an \textit{unrestricted model}
with technical, trading and social media indicators. We verified whether the consideration of
trading and social media indicators, along with the classic technical variables (such as price's
returns), leads to a significative improvement in the prediction of cryptocurrencies price's
changes. We conducted the study on the two highest cryptocurrencies in volume and value (at the time
of the study): Bitcoin and Ethereum. We implemented four different machine learning algorithms
typically used in time-series classification problems: \textit{Multi Layers Perceptron (MLP)},
\textit{Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)}, \textit{Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) neural network}
and \textit{Attention Long Short Term Memory (ALSTM)}. We devised the experiments using the advanced
bootstrap technique to consider the variance problem on test samples, which allowed us to evaluate
a more reliable estimate of the model's performance. Furthermore, the \textit{Grid Search} technique
was used to find the best \textit{hyperparameters} values for each implemented algorithm. The
study shows that, based on the hourly frequency results, the unrestricted model outperforms the
restricted one. The addition of the trading indicators to the classic technical indicators improves
the accuracy of Bitcoin and Ethereum price's changes prediction, with an increase of accuracy from
a range of 51-55\% for the restricted model, to 67-84\% for the unrestricted model.

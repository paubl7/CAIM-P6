Beyond 5G networks are expected to support massive traffic through decentralized solutions and
advanced networking mechanisms. This paper aims at contributing towards this vision by expanding
the role of mobile devices to transform them into part of the network fabric. This is achieved through
the integration of device-centric wireless networks, including Device-to-Device (D2D) communications,
and the Next Generation of Opportunistic networking (NGO). This integration offers multiple communication
modes such as opportunistic cellular and opportunistic D2D-aided communications. We propose
an integration of device-centric wireless networks and NGO that is not driven by a precise knowledge
of the presence of the links, but by their potential to support the requested demand and service which
is estimated using context information available in cellular network. The proposed technique
utilizes a novel concept of graph to model the evolution of the networking conditions and network
connectivity. Uncertainties and future conditions are included in the proposed graph model through
anticipatory mobile networking to estimate the transmission energy cost of the different communication
modes along the time. Based on these estimates, the devices schedule their transmissions using
the most efficient communication mode. These decisions are later revisited in real-time using
more precise knowledge about the network state. The conducted evaluation shows that the proposed
technique significantly reduces the energy consumption (from 60% to 90% depending on the scenario)
compared to traditional single-hop cellular communications and performs closely to an ideal oracle
based system with full knowledge of present and future events.

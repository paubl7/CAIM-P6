Truck platooning refers to a series of trucks driving in close proximity via communication technologies,
and it is considered one of the most implementable systems of connected and automated vehicles,
bringing huge energy savings and safety improvements. Properly planning platoons and evaluating
the potential of truck platooning are crucial to trucking companies and transportation authorities.
This study proposes a series of data mining approaches to learn spontaneous truck platooning patterns
from massive trajectories. An enhanced map matching algorithm is developed to identify truck headings
by using digital map data, followed by an adaptive spatial clustering algorithm to detect instantaneous
co-moving truck sets. These sets are then aggregated to find the network-wide maximum platoon duration
and size through frequent itemset mining for computational efficiency. We leverage real GPS data
collected from truck fleeting systems in Liaoning Province, China, to evaluate platooning performance
and successfully extract spatiotemporal platooning patterns. Results show that approximately
36% spontaneous truck platoons can be coordinated by speed adjustment without changing routes
and schedules. The average platooning distance and duration ratios for these platooned trucks
are 9.6% and 9.9%, respectively, leading to a 2.8% reduction in total fuel consumption. We also distinguish
the optimal platooning periods and space headways for national freeways and trunk roads, and prioritize
the road segments with high possibilities of truck platooning. The derived results are reproducible,
providing useful policy implications and operational strategies for large-scale truck platoon
planning and roadside infrastructure construction.

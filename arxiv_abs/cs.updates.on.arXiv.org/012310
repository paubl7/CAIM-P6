This paper investigates the effects of plasticity on the effective fracture toughness. A layered
material is considered as a modelling system. An elastic-plastic phase-field model and a surfing
boundary condition are used to study how the crack propagates throughout the material and the evolution
of the effective toughness as a function of the layer angle. We first study three idealized situations,
where only one property among fracture toughness, Young's modulus and yield strength is heterogeneous
whereas the others are uniform. We observe that in the case of toughness and strength heterogeneity,
the material exhibits anomalous isotropy: the effective toughness is equal to the largest of the
point-wise values for any layer angle except when the layers are parallel to the macroscopic direction
of propagation. As the layer angle decreases, the crack propagates along the brittle-to-tough
interfaces, whereas it goes straight when the layers have different yield strength but uniform
toughness. We find that smooth deflections in the crack path do not induce any overall toughening
and that the effective toughness is not proportional to either the cumulated fracture energy or
the cumulated plastic work. In the case of elastic heterogeneity, the material is anisotropic in
the sense of the effective toughness, as the latter varies as a function of the layer angle. Four toughening
mechanisms are active: stress fluctuations, crack renucleation, plastic dissipation and plastic
blunting. Finally, we consider a layered medium comprised of compliant-tough-weak and stiff-brittle-strong
phases, as it is the case for many structural composites. We observe a transition from an interface-dominated
to a plasticity-dominated failure regime, as the phase constituents become more ductile. The material
is anisotropic in the sense of the effective toughness.

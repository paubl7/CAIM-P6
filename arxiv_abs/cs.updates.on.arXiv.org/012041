Medical diagnostic image analysis (e.g., CT scan or X-Ray) using machine learning is an efficient
and accurate way to detect COVID-19 infections. However, sharing diagnostic images across medical
institutions is usually not allowed due to the concern of patients' privacy. This causes the issue
of insufficient datasets for training the image classification model. Federated learning is an
emerging privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that produces an unbiased global model
based on the received updates of local models trained by clients without exchanging clients' local
data. Nevertheless, the default setting of federated learning introduces huge communication
cost of transferring model updates and can hardly ensure model performance when data heterogeneity
of clients heavily exists. To improve communication efficiency and model performance, in this
paper, we propose a novel dynamic fusion-based federated learning approach for medical diagnostic
image analysis to detect COVID-19 infections. First, we design an architecture for dynamic fusion-based
federated learning systems to analyse medical diagnostic images. Further, we present a dynamic
fusion method to dynamically decide the participating clients according to their local model performance
and schedule the model fusion-based on participating clients' training time. In addition, we summarise
a category of medical diagnostic image datasets for COVID-19 detection, which can be used by the
machine learning community for image analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach
is feasible and performs better than the default setting of federated learning in terms of model
performance, communication efficiency and fault tolerance.

For present e-commerce platforms, session-based recommender systems are developed to predict
users' preference for next-item recommendation. Although a session can usually reflect a user's
current preference, a local shift of the user's intention within the session may still exist. Specifically,
the interactions that take place in the early positions within a session generally indicate the
user's initial intention, while later interactions are more likely to represent the latest intention.
Such positional information has been rarely considered in existing methods, which restricts their
ability to capture the significance of interactions at different positions. To thoroughly exploit
the positional information within a session, a theoretical framework is developed in this paper
to provide an in-depth analysis of the positional information. We formally define the properties
of forward-awareness and backward-awareness to evaluate the ability of positional encoding schemes
in capturing the initial and the latest intention. According to our analysis, existing positional
encoding schemes are generally forward-aware only, which can hardly represent the dynamics of
the intention in a session. To enhance the positional encoding scheme for the session-based recommendation,
a dual positional encoding (DPE) is proposed to account for both forward-awareness and backward-awareness.
Based on DPE, we propose a novel Positional Recommender (PosRec) model with a well-designed Position-aware
Gated Graph Neural Network module to fully exploit the positional information for session-based
recommendation tasks. Extensive experiments are conducted on two e-commerce benchmark datasets,
Yoochoose and Diginetica and the experimental results show the superiority of the PosRec by comparing
it with the state-of-the-art session-based recommender models.

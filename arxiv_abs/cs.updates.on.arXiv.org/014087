Permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin have excelled at financial services. Yet, adversaries
extract monetary value from the mesh of decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts. Some have
characterized the Ethereum peer-to-peer network as a dark forest, wherein broadcast transactions
represent prey, which are devoured by generalized trading bots. While transaction (re)ordering
and front-running are known to cause losses to users, we quantify how much value was sourced from
blockchain extractable value (BEV). We systematize a transaction ordering taxonomy to quantify
the USD extracted from sandwich attacks, liquidations, and decentralized exchange arbitrage.
We estimate that over 2 years, those trading activities yielded 28.80M USD in profit, divided among
5,084 unique addresses. While arbitrage and liquidations might appear benign, traders can front-run
others, causing financial losses to competitors. To provide an example of a generalized trading
bot, we show a simple yet effective automated transaction replay algorithm capable of replacing
unconfirmed transactions without the need to understand the victim transactions' underlying
logic. We estimate that our transaction replay algorithm could have yielded a profit of 51,688.33
ETH (17.60M USD) over 2 years on past blockchain data. We also find that miners do not broadcast 1.64%
of their mined transactions and instead choose to mine them privately. Privately mined and non-shared
transactions, cannot be front-run by other traders or miners. We show that the largest Ethereum
mining pool performs arbitrage and seemingly tries to cloak its private transaction mining activities.
We therefore provide evidence that miners already extract Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which
could destabilize the blockchain consensus security, as related work has shown.

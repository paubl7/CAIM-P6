A recent take towards Federated Analytics (FA), which allows analytical insights of distributed
datasets, reuses the Federated Learning (FL) infrastructure to evaluate the population-level
summary of model performances. However, the current realization of FL adopts single server-multiple
client architecture with limited scope for FA, which often results in learning models with poor
generalization, i.e., an ability to handle new/unseen data, for real-world applications. Moreover,
a hierarchical FL structure with distributed computing platforms demonstrates incoherent model
performances at different aggregation levels. Therefore, we need to design a robust learning mechanism
than the FL that (i) unleashes a viable infrastructure for FA and (ii) trains learning models with
better generalization capability. In this work, we adopt the novel democratized learning (Dem-AI)
principles and designs to meet these objectives. Firstly, we show the hierarchical learning structure
of the proposed edge-assisted democratized learning mechanism, namely Edge-DemLearn, as a practical
framework to empower generalization capability in support of FA. Secondly, we validate Edge-DemLearn
as a flexible model training mechanism to build a distributed control and aggregation methodology
in regions by leveraging the distributed computing infrastructure. The distributed edge computing
servers construct regional models, minimize the communication loads, and ensure distributed
data analytic application's scalability. To that end, we adhere to a near-optimal two-sided many-to-one
matching approach to handle the combinatorial constraints in Edge-DemLearn and solve it for fast
knowledge acquisition with optimization of resource allocation and associations between multiple
servers and devices. Extensive simulation results on real datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of the proposed methods.

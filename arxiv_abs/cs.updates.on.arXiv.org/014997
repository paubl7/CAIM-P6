A new generation of cloud data warehouses has changed the landscape of information technology.
This shift brings large amounts of data and compute power closer to many users in enterprises. The
ability to directly access the warehouse data, interactively analyze and explore it at scale can
empower users, improving the effectiveness and efficiency of their decision making cycles as never
before. However, existing tools for querying, analyzing, and exploring data in cloud warehouses
are either limited in facilitating iterative ad-hoc analysis or difficult to use for the largest
segment of enterprise users, who have limited time, interest, or skills for writing queries. Here
we present Sigma Worksheet, a new system for interactively constructing data warehouse queries
through visual direct manipulation. Sigma Worksheet enables users to perform powerful interactive
ad-hoc visual data analysis without writing queries. To this end, it combines the notion of a multidimensional
data cube with an expressive, spreadsheet-like query construction interface, in order to ease
the generation of otherwise complex queries. The Worksheet interface borrows successful features
from electronic spreadsheets to support the large segment of users familiar with that environment.
We demonstrate the usefulness of Sigma Worksheet through two in-depth use cases and report on user
feedback that we elicit through a 100-person survey followed by a semi-structured interview study
with 70 participants. We find that Sigma Worksheet provides an easier to use and learn interface
for accessing, transforming, exploring, and analyzing data in cloud data warehouses, improving
the visual data analysis and exploration experience for both expert and non-expert enterprise
users. Our findings also suggest Sigma Worksheet can further improve user experience by providing
guidance to users at various steps of data analysis.

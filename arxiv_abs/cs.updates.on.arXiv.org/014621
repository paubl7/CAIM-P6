Building natural language (NL) interfaces for databases has been a long-standing challenge for
several decades. The major advantage of these so-called NL-to-SQL systems is that end-users can
query complex databases without the need to know SQL or the underlying database schema. Due to significant
advancements in machine learning, the recent focus of research has been on neural networks to tackle
this challenge on complex datasets like Spider. Several recent NL-to-SQL systems achieve promising
results on this dataset. However, none of the published systems, that provide either the source
code or executable binaries, extract and incorporate values from the user questions for generating
SQL statements. Thus, the practical use of these systems in a real-world scenario has not been sufficiently
demonstrated yet. In this paper we propose ValueNet light and ValueNet -- two end-to-end NL-to-SQL
systems that incorporate values using the challenging Spider dataset. The main idea of our approach
is to use not only metadata information from the underlying database but also information on the
base data as input for our neural network architecture. In particular, we propose a novel architecture
sketch to extract values from a user question and come up with possible value candidates which are
not explicitly mentioned in the question. We then use a neural model based on an encoder-decoder
architecture to synthesize the SQL query. Finally, we evaluate our model on the Spider challenge
using the Execution Accuracy metric, a more difficult metric than used by most participants of the
challenge. Our experimental evaluation demonstrates that ValueNet light and ValueNet reach state-of-the-art
results of 67% and 62% accuracy, respectively, for translating from NL to SQL whilst incorporating
values.

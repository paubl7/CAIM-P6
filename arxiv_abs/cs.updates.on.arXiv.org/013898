Middleboxes in a computer network system inspect and analyse network traffic to detect malicious
communications, monitor system performance and provide operational services. However, encrypted
traffic hinders the ability of middleboxes to perform such services. A common practice in addressing
this issue is by employing a "Man-in-the-Middle" (MitM) approach, wherein an encrypted traffic
flow between two endpoints is interrupted, decrypted and analysed by the middleboxes. The MitM
approach is straightforward and is used by many organisations, but there are both practical and
privacy concerns. Due to the cost of the MitM appliances and the latency incurred in the encrypt-decrypt
processes, enterprises continue to seek solutions that are less costly. There were discussion
on the many efforts required to configure MitM. Besides, MitM violates end-to-end privacy guarantee,
raising privacy concerns and issues on compliance especially with the rising awareness on user
privacy. Furthermore, some of the MitM implementations were found to be flawed. Consequently,
new practical and privacy-preserving techniques for inspection over encrypted traffic were proposed.
We examine them to compare their advantages, limitations and challenges. We categorise them into
four main categories by defining a framework that consist of system architectures, use cases, trust
and threat models. These are searchable encryption, access control, machine learning and trusted
hardware. We first discuss the man-in-the-middle approach as a baseline, then discuss in details
each of them, and provide an in-depth comparisons of their advantages and limitations. By doing
so we describe practical constraints, advantages and pitfalls towards adopting the techniques.
We also give insights on the gaps between research work and industrial deployment, which leads us
to the discussion on the challenges and research directions.

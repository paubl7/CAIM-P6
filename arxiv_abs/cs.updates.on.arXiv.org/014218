We present a novel mapping approach for WENO schemes through the use of an approximate constant mapping
function which is constructed by employing an approximation of the classic signum function. The
new approximate constant mapping function is designed to meet the overall criteria for a proper
mapping function required in the design of the WENO-PM6 scheme. The WENO-PM6 scheme was proposed
to overcome the potential loss of accuracy of the WENO-M scheme which was developed to recover the
optimal convergence order of the WENO-JS scheme at critical points. Our new mapped WENO scheme,
denoted as WENO-ACM, maintains almost all advantages of the WENO-PM6 scheme, including low dissipation
and high resolution, while decreases the number of mathematical operations remarkably in every
mapping process leading to a significant improvement of efficiency. The convergence rates of the
WENO-ACM scheme have been shown through one-dimensional linear advection equation with various
initial conditions. Numerical results of one-dimensional Euler equations for the Riemann problems,
the Mach 3 shock-density wave interaction and the Woodward-Colella interacting blastwaves are
improved in comparison with the results obtained by the WENO-JS, WENO-M and WENO-PM6 schemes. Numerical
experiments with two-dimensional problems as the 2D Riemann problem, the shock-vortex interaction,
the 2D explosion problem, the double Mach reflection and the forward-facing step problem modeled
via the two dimensional Euler equations have been conducted to demonstrate the high resolution
and the effectiveness of the WENO-ACM scheme. The WENO-ACM scheme provides significantly better
resolution than the WENO-M scheme and slightly better resolution than the WENO-PM6 scheme, and
compared to the WENO-M and WENO-PM6 schemes, the extra computational cost is reduced by more than
83% and 93%, respectively.

Many methods have been developed in trajectory planning in order to achieve smooth and accurate
motion with considering the constraints of kinematics constraints such as angular position, velocity,
acceleration, and jerk. The problem of using the combination of n-order polynomials is that there
is no ideally match between the segments of trajectory path at the via point in terms of the number
of kinematic constraints. It leads to generate undesirable trajectory path at the via point that
connects between two segments of the trajectory path. In this paper, we aim to investigate the effect
of increasing to higher order polynomial blends on the accuracy of the via points with considering
different kinematics constraints. Based on that, the methodology that was used in this paper is
based on the polynomial segment with the higher polynomial blend (PSPB). Three techniques implemented
which are 4-3-4 PSPB, 5-4-5 PSPB, and 6-5-6 PSPB. Each technique implemented based on applying different
kinematic constraints. The three techniques validated using a modeling design in SemiMechanics.
According to the methodology, the result analyzed and discussed in terms of angular position, angular
velocity, angular acceleration, and angular jerk based on Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Average
Difference Error (ADE). The result shows that RMSE of angular position for 4-3-4 PSPB-1, 4-3-4 PSPB-2,
5-4-5 PSPB-1, 5-4-5 PSPB-2, 6-5-6 PSPB-1, and 6-5-6 PSPB-2 are 0.4574, 0.0172, 10.9089, 0.1242,
0.6153, and 0.3128 degrees respectively. At the same time, the ADE are 0.0455, 0.0017, 1.0855, 0.0124,
0.0612, and 0.0311 degrees respectively. Thus, the error is increased obviously when there is no
ideal match at the via point in terms of a number of kinematic constraints.

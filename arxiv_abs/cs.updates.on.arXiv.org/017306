Social media plays a pivotal role in disseminating news globally and acts as a platform for people
to express their opinions on various topics. A wide variety of views accompanies COVID-19 vaccination
drives across the globe, often colored by emotions, which change along with rising cases, approval
of vaccines, and multiple factors discussed online. This study aims at analyzing the temporal evolution
of different Emotion categories: Hesitation, Rage, Sorrow, Anticipation, Faith, and Contentment
with Influencing Factors: Vaccine Rollout, Misinformation, Health Effects, and Inequities as
lexical categories created from Tweets belonging to five countries with vital vaccine roll-out
programs, namely, India, United States of America, Brazil, United Kingdom, and Australia. We extracted
a corpus of nearly 1.8 million Twitter posts related to COVID-19 vaccination. Using cosine distance
from selected seed words, we expanded the vocabulary of each category and tracked the longitudinal
change in their strength from June 2020 to April 2021. We used community detection algorithms to
find modules in positive correlation networks. Our findings suggest that tweets expressing hesitancy
towards vaccines contain the highest mentions of health-related effects in all countries. Our
results indicated that the patterns of hesitancy were variable across geographies and can help
us learn targeted interventions. We also observed a significant change in the linear trends of categories
like hesitation and contentment before and after approval of vaccines. Negative emotions like
rage and sorrow gained the highest importance in the alluvial diagram. They formed a significant
module with all the influencing factors in April 2021, when India observed the second wave of COVID-19
cases. The relationship between Emotions and Influencing Factors was found to be variable across
the countries.

With the proliferation of smart phone, a major growth in the use of apps related to the health category,
specifically those concerned with foot health can be observed. Although new, these apps are being
used practically for scanning feet with an aim to providing accurate information about various
properties of the human foot. With the availability of many 'foot scanning and measuring apps' in
the app stores, the need for an evaluation system for such apps can be deemed necessary as little information
regarding the evidence-based quality of these apps is available. To characterize the assessment
of measurement techniques and essential software quality characteristics of mobile foot measuring
apps, and determine their effectiveness for potential use as commercial professional tools for
foot care health professionals such as pedorthists, podiatrists, orthotists and so on, to assist
in measuring foot for custom shoes, and for individuals to enhance the awareness of foot health and
hygiene and prevention of foot-related problems. An electronic search across Android and iOS app
stores was conducted between July 2020 and August 2020 for apps related to foot measurement. Mobile
apps with stated goals of foot measurement and general foot health were identified and selected
by three independent raters and discrepancies regarding the selected apps were resolved via a fourth
rater. Evaluation inferences found all apps failing to meet even half of the measurement-specific
criteria required for the proper manufacturing of custom-made footwear. 23% (6/26) of apps were
found to utilize either external scanners or advanced algorithms to reconstruct 3D models of user
foot that can possibly be used for ordering custom-made footwear and medical casts for fitting irregular
foot sizes and shapes. Overall, current apps for foot measurement do not follow any specific guidelines
for measurement purposes.

This paper investigates the security enhancement of an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted
non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) network, where a distributed IRS enabled NOMA transmission
framework is proposed to serve users securely in the presence of a passive eavesdropper. Considering
that eavesdropper's instantaneous channel state information (CSI) is challenging to acquire
in practice, we utilize secrecy outage probability (SOP) as the security metric. A problem of maximizing
the minimum secrecy rate among users, subject to the successive interference cancellation (SIC)
decoding constraints and SOP constraints, by jointly optimizing transmit beamforming at the BS
and phase shifts of IRSs, is formulated. For special case with a single-antenna BS, we derive the
exact closed-form SOP expressions and propose a novel ring-penalty based successive convex approximation
(SCA) algorithm to design power allocation and phase shifts jointly. While for the more general
and challenging case with a multi-antenna BS, we adopt the Bernstein-type inequality to approximate
the SOP constraints by a deterministic convex form. To proceed, an efficient alternating optimization
(AO) algorithm is developed to solve the considered problem. Numerical results validate the advantages
of the proposed algorithms over the baseline schemes. Particularly, two interesting phenomena
on distributed IRS deployment are revealed: 1) the secrecy rate peak is achieved only when distributed
IRSs share the reflecting elements equally; and 2) the distributed IRS deployment does not always
outperform the centralized IRS deployment, due to the tradeoff between the number of IRSs and the
reflecting elements equipped at each IRS.

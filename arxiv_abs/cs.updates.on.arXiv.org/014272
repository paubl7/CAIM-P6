Understanding the power of quantum supremacy experiments is one of the most pressing topics in the
NISQ era. In this work we make progress toward bridging the remaining gaps between theory and experiment,
incorporating the effects of experimental noise into the theoretical hardness arguments. First,
we improve the robustness of prior hardness results in this area. For random circuit sampling, we
show that computing the output probability of an $m$-gate random quantum circuit to within additive
imprecision $2^{-O(m\log m)}$ is $\#\mathsf{P}$-hard, an exponential improvement over the prior
hardness results of Bouland et al. and Movassagh which were resistant to imprecision $2^{-O(m^3)}$.
This nearly reaches the threshold ($2^{-O(m)}$) sufficient to establish the hardness of sampling
for constant-depth random circuits. For BosonSampling, we show $\#\mathsf{P}$-hardness of computing
output probabilities of $n$-photon $m=\text{poly}(n)$ mode BosonSampling experiments to additive
error $2^{-O(n\log n)}$. This is within a constant factor in the exponent of the robustness required
for hardness of sampling. To prove these results we introduce a new robust Berlekamp-Welch argument
over the Reals, and moreover substantially simplify prior robustness arguments. Second, we show
that in the random circuit sampling case, these results are still true in the presence of a constant
rate of noise, so long as the noise rate is below the error detection threshold. That is, even though
random circuits with a constant noise rate converge rapidly to the maximally mixed state, the small
deviations in their output probabilities away from uniform remain difficult to compute. Interestingly,
we then show that our results are in tension with one another, and the latter result implies the former
is essentially optimal with respect to additive imprecision, even with generalizations of our
techniques.

Factorization Machines (FMs) are effective in incorporating side information to overcome the
cold-start and data sparsity problems in recommender systems. Traditional FMs adopt the inner
product to model the second-order interactions between different attributes, which are represented
via feature vectors. The problem is that the inner product violates the triangle inequality property
of feature vectors. As a result, it cannot well capture fine-grained attribute interactions, resulting
in sub-optimal performance. Recently, the Euclidean distance is exploited in FMs to replace the
inner product and has delivered better performance. However, previous FM methods including the
ones equipped with the Euclidean distance all focus on the attribute-level interaction modeling,
ignoring the critical intrinsic feature correlations inside attributes. Thereby, they fail to
model the complex and rich interactions exhibited in the real-world data. To tackle this problem,
in this paper, we propose a FM framework equipped with generalized metric learning techniques to
better capture these feature correlations. In particular, based on this framework, we present
a Mahalanobis distance and a deep neural network (DNN) methods, which can effectively model the
linear and non-linear correlations between features, respectively. Besides, we design an efficient
approach for simplifying the model functions. Experiments on several benchmark datasets demonstrate
that our proposed framework outperforms several state-of-the-art baselines by a large margin.
Moreover, we collect a new large-scale dataset on second-hand trading to justify the effectiveness
of our method over cold-start and data sparsity problems in recommender systems.

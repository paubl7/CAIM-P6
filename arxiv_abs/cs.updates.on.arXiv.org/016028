Online stores often utilize product relationships such as bundles and substitutes to improve their
catalog quality and guide customers through myriad choices. Entity resolution using pairwise
product matching models offers a means of inferring relationships between products. In mature
data repositories, the relationships may be mostly correct but require incremental improvements
owing to errors in the original data or in the entity resolution system. It is critical to devise incremental
entity resolution (IER) approaches for improving the health of relationships. However, most existing
research on IER focuses on the addition of new products or information into existing relationships.
Relatively little research has been done for detecting low quality within current relationships.
This paper proposes a novel method for identifying inconsistent clusters (IC), existing groups
of related products that do not belong together. We propose to treat the identification of inconsistent
clusters as a supervised learning task which predicts whether a graph of products with similarities
as weighted edges should be partitioned into multiple clusters. In this case, the problem becomes
a classification task on weighted graphs and represents an interesting application area for modern
tools such as Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). We demonstrate that existing Message Passing neural
networks perform well at this task, exceeding traditional graph processing techniques. We also
develop a novel message aggregation scheme for Message Passing Neural Networks that further improves
the performance of GNNs on this task. We apply the model to synthetic datasets, a public benchmark
dataset, and an internal application. Our results demonstrate the value of graph classification
in IER and the ability of graph neural networks to develop useful representations for graph partitioning.

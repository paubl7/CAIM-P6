We study fundamental point-line covering problems in computational geometry, in which the input
is a set $S$ of points in the plane. The first is the Rich Lines problem, which asks for the set of all
lines that each covers at least $\lambda$ points from $S$, for a given integer parameter $\lambda
\geq 2$; this problem subsumes the 3-Points-on-Line problem and the Exact Fitting problem, which
-- the latter -- asks for a line containing the maximum number of points. The second is the NP-hard
problem Line Cover, which asks for a set of $k$ lines that cover the points of $S$, for a given parameter
$k \in \mathbb{N}$. Both problems have been extensively studied. In particular, the Rich Lines
problem is a fundamental problem whose solution serves as a building block for several algorithms
in computational geometry. For Rich Lines and Exact Fitting, we present a randomized Monte Carlo
algorithm that achieves a lower running time than that of Guibas et al.'s algorithm [Computational
Geometry 1996], for a wide range of the parameter $\lambda$. We derive lower-bound results showing
that, for $\lambda =\Omega(\sqrt{n \log n})$, the upper bound on the running time of this randomized
algorithm matches the lower bound that we derive on the time complexity of Rich Lines in the algebraic
computation trees model. For Line Cover, we present two kernelization algorithms: a randomized
Monte Carlo algorithm and a deterministic algorithm. Both algorithms improve the running time
of existing kernelization algorithms for Line Cover. We derive lower-bound results showing that
the running time of the randomized algorithm we present comes close to the lower bound we derive on
the time complexity of kernelization algorithms for Line Cover in the algebraic computation trees
model.

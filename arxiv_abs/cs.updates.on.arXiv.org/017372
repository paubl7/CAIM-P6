In this work, we study estimation problems in nonlinear mechanical systems subject to non-stationary
and unknown excitation, which are common and critical problems in design and health management
of mechanical systems. A primary-auxiliary model scheduling procedure based on time-domain transmissibilities
is proposed and performed under switching linear dynamics: In addition to constructing a primary
transmissibility family from the pseudo-inputs to the output during the offline stage, an auxiliary
transmissibility family is constructed by further decomposing the pseudo-input vector into two
parts. The auxiliary family enables to determine the unknown working condition at which the system
is currently running at, and then an appropriate transmissibility from the primary transmissibility
family for estimating the unknown output can be selected during the online estimation stage. As
a result, the proposed approach offers a generalizable and explainable solution to the signal estimation
problems in nonlinear mechanical systems in the context of switching linear dynamics with unknown
inputs. A real-world application to the estimation of the vertical wheel force in a full vehicle
system are, respectively, conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.
During the vehicle design phase, the vertical wheel force is the most important one among Wheel Center
Loads (WCLs), and it is often measured directly with expensive, intrusive, and hard-to-install
measurement devices during full vehicle testing campaigns. Meanwhile, the estimation problem
of the vertical wheel force has not been solved well and is still of great interest. The experimental
results show good performances of the proposed method in the sense of estimation accuracy for estimating
the vertical wheel force.

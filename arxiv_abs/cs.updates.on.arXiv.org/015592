The outbreak of the novel Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has caused unprecedented impacts
to people's daily life around the world. Various measures and policies such as lockdown and social-distancing
are implemented by governments to combat the disease during the pandemic period. These measures
and policies as well as virus itself may cause different mental health issues to people such as depression,
anxiety, sadness, etc. In this paper, we exploit the massive text data posted by Twitter users to
analyse the sentiment dynamics of people living in the state of New South Wales (NSW) in Australia
during the pandemic period. Different from the existing work that mostly focuses the country-level
and static sentiment analysis, we analyse the sentiment dynamics at the fine-grained local government
areas (LGAs). Based on the analysis of around 94 million tweets that posted by around 183 thousand
users located at different LGAs in NSW in five months, we found that people in NSW showed an overall
positive sentimental polarity and the COVID-19 pandemic decreased the overall positive sentimental
polarity during the pandemic period. The fine-grained analysis of sentiment in LGAs found that
despite the dominant positive sentiment most of days during the study period, some LGAs experienced
significant sentiment changes from positive to negative. This study also analysed the sentimental
dynamics delivered by the hot topics in Twitter such as government policies (e.g. the Australia's
JobKeeper program, lockdown, social-distancing) as well as the focused social events (e.g. the
Ruby Princess Cruise). The results showed that the policies and events did affect people's overall
sentiment, and they affected people's overall sentiment differently at different stages.

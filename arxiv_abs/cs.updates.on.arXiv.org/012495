Social recommender systems are expected to improve recommendation quality by incorporating social
information when there is little user-item interaction data. However, recent reports from industry
show that social recommender systems consistently fail in practice. According to the negative
findings, the failure is attributed to: (1) A majority of users only have a very limited number of
neighbors in social networks and can hardly benefit from social relations; (2) Social relations
are noisy but they are indiscriminately used; (3) Social relations are assumed to be universally
applicable to multiple scenarios while they are actually multi-faceted and show heterogeneous
strengths in different scenarios. Most existing social recommendation models only consider the
homophily in social networks and neglect these drawbacks. In this paper we propose a deep adversarial
framework based on graph convolutional networks (GCN) to address these problems. Concretely,
for (1) and (2), a GCN-based autoencoder is developed to augment the relation data by encoding high-order
and complex connectivity patterns, and meanwhile is optimized subject to the constraint of reconstructing
the social profile to guarantee the validity of the identified neighborhood. After obtaining enough
purified social relations for each user, a GCN-based attentive social recommendation module is
designed to address (3) by capturing the heterogeneous strengths of social relations. Finally,
we adopt adversarial training to unify all the components by playing a Minimax game and ensure a coordinated
effort to enhance recommendation performance. Extensive experiments on multiple open datasets
demonstrate the superiority of our framework and the ablation study confirms the importance and
effectiveness of each component.

The development of accurate methods for multi-label classification (MLC) of remote sensing (RS)
images is one of the most important research topics in RS. Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)
based methods have triggered substantial performance gains in RS MLC problems, requiring a large
number of reliable training images annotated by multiple land-cover class labels. Collecting
such data is time-consuming and costly. To address this problem, the publicly available thematic
products, which can include noisy labels, can be used for annotating RS images with zero-labeling
cost. However, multi-label noise (which can be associated with wrong as well as missing label annotations)
can distort the learning process of the MLC algorithm, resulting in inaccurate predictions. The
detection and correction of label noise are challenging tasks, especially in a multi-label scenario,
where each image can be associated with more than one label. To address this problem, we propose a
novel Consensual Collaborative Multi-Label Learning (CCML) method to alleviate the adverse effects
of multi-label noise during the training phase of the CNN model. CCML identifies, ranks, and corrects
noisy multi-labels in RS images based on four main modules: 1) group lasso module; 2) discrepancy
module; 3) flipping module; and 4) swap module. The task of the group lasso module is to detect the
potentially noisy labels assigned to the multi-labeled training images, and the discrepancy module
ensures that the two collaborative networks learn diverse features, while obtaining the same predictions.
The flipping module is designed to correct the identified noisy multi-labels, while the swap module
task is devoted to exchanging the ranking information between two networks. Our code is publicly

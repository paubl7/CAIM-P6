In this work, we analyze an unfitted discontinuous Galerkin discretization for the numerical solution
of the Stokes system based on equal higher-order discontinuous velocities and pressures. This
approach combines the best from both worlds, firstly the advantages of a piece-wise discontinuous
high-order accurate approximation and secondly the advantages of an unfitted to the true geometry
grid around possibly complex objects and/or geometrical deformations. Utilizing a fictitious
domain framework, the physical domain of interest is embedded in an unfitted background mesh and
the geometrically unfitted discretization is built upon symmetric interior penalty discontinuous
Galerkin formulation. To enhance stability we enrich the discrete variational formulation with
a pressure stabilization term. Moreover, the present contribution adopts high order ghost penalty
strategies to address the ill conditioning of the system matrix caused by small truncated elements
with respect to the unfitted boundary. Motivated by continuous unfitted FEM [21,75,76] along with
other unfitted mesh surveys grounded on discontinuous spaces [10,44-46,74], we use proper velocity
and pressure ghost penalties defined on faces of cut cells to establish a robust high-order method,
in spite of the cell agglomeration technique usually applied on dG methods. The current presentation
should prove valuable in engineering applications where special emphasis is placed on the optimal
effective approximation attaining much smaller relative errors in coarser meshes. Inf-sup stability,
the optimal order of convergence, and the condition number sensitivity with respect to cut configuration
are investigated. Numerical examples verify the theoretical results.

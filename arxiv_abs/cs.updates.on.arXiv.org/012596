In this paper, a 1+1 server protection scheme is considered where two servers, a primary and a secondary
processing server are used to serve ECG monitoring applications concurrently. The infrastructure
is designed to be resilient against server failure under two scenarios related to the geographic
location of primary and secondary servers and resilient against both server and network failures.
A Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) model is used to optimise the number and locations of both
primary and secondary processing servers so that the energy consumption of the networking equipment
and processing are minimised. The results show that considering a scenario for server protection
without geographical constraints compared to the non-resilient scenario has resulted in both
network and processing energy penalty as the traffic is doubled. The results also reveal that increasing
the level of resilience to consider geographical constraints compared to case without geographical
constraints resulted in higher network energy penalty when the demand is low as more nodes are utilised
to place the processing servers under the geographic constraints. Also, increasing the level of
resilience to consider network protection with link and node disjoint selection has resulted in
a low network energy penalty at high demands due to the activation of a large part of the network in
any case due to the demands. However, the results show that the network energy penalty is reduced
with the increasing number of processing servers at each candidate node. Meanwhile, the same energy
for processing is consumed regardless of the increasing level of resilience as the same number of
processing servers are utilised. A heuristic is developed for each resilience scenario for real-time
implementation where the results show that the performance of the heuristic is approaching the
results of the MILP model.

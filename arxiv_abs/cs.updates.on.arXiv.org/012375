This paper studies the indoor localisation of WiFi devices based on a commodity chipset and standard
channel sounding. First, we present a novel shallow neural network (SNN) in which features are extracted
from the channel state information (CSI) corresponding to WiFi subcarriers received on different
antennas and used to train the model. The single-layer architecture of this localisation neural
network makes it lightweight and easy-to-deploy on devices with stringent constraints on computational
resources. We further investigate for localisation the use of deep learning models and design novel
architectures for convolutional neural network (CNN) and long-short term memory (LSTM). We extensively
evaluate these localisation algorithms for continuous tracking in indoor environments. Experimental
results prove that even an SNN model, after a careful handcrafted feature extraction, can achieve
accurate localisation. Meanwhile, using a well-organised architecture, the neural network models
can be trained directly with raw data from the CSI and localisation features can be automatically
extracted to achieve accurate position estimates. We also found that the performance of neural
network-based methods are directly affected by the number of anchor access points (APs) regardless
of their structure. With three APs, all neural network models proposed in this paper can obtain localisation
accuracy of around 0.5 metres. In addition the proposed deep NN architecture reduces the data pre-processing
time by 6.5 hours compared with a shallow NN using the data collected in our testbed. In the deployment
phase, the inference time is also significantly reduced to 0.1 ms per sample. We also demonstrate
the generalisation capability of the proposed method by evaluating models using different target
movement characteristics to the ones in which they were trained.

Blockchain (BC) systems are highly distributed peer-to-peer networks that offer an alternative
to centralized services and promise robustness to coordinated attacks. However, the resilience
and overall security of a BC system rests heavily on the structural properties of its underlying
peer-to-peer overlay. Despite their success, BC overlay networks' critical design aspects, connectivity
properties and network-layer inter-dependencies are still poorly understood. In this work, we
set out to fill this gap and study the most important overlay network structural properties and robustness
to targeted attacks of seven distinct BC networks. In particular, we probe and crawl these BC networks
every two hours to gather information about all their available peers, over a duration of 28 days.
We analyze 335 network snapshots per BC network, for a total of 2345 snapshots. We construct, at frequent
intervals, connectivity graphs for each BC network, consisting of all potential connections between
peers. We analyze the structural graph properties of these networks and compare them across the
seven BC networks. We also study how these properties associate with the resilience of each network
to partitioning attacks, i.e., when peers are selected, attacked and taken offline, using different
selection strategies driven by the aforementioned structural properties. In fact, we show that
by targeting fewer than 10 highly-connected peers, major BCs such as Bitcoin can be partitioned
into disjoint, i.e., disconnected, components. Finally, we uncover a hidden interconnection
between different BC networks, where certain peers participate in more than one BC network, which
has serious implications for the robustness of the overall BC network ecosystem.

In this paper, we introduce a new approach based on distance fields to exactly impose boundary conditions
in physics-informed deep neural networks. The challenges in satisfying Dirichlet boundary conditions
in meshfree and particle methods are well-known. This issue is also pertinent in the development
of physics informed neural networks (PINN) for the solution of partial differential equations.
We introduce geometry-aware trial functions in artifical neural networks to improve the training
in deep learning for partial differential equations. To this end, we use concepts from constructive
solid geometry (R-functions) and generalized barycentric coordinates (mean value potential
fields) to construct $\phi$, an approximate distance function to the boundary of a domain. To exactly
impose homogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions, the trial function is taken as $\phi$ multiplied
by the PINN approximation, and its generalization via transfinite interpolation is used to a priori
satisfy inhomogeneous Dirichlet (essential), Neumann (natural), and Robin boundary conditions
on complex geometries. In doing so, we eliminate modeling error associated with the satisfaction
of boundary conditions in a collocation method and ensure that kinematic admissibility is met pointwise
in a Ritz method. We present numerical solutions for linear and nonlinear boundary-value problems
over domains with affine and curved boundaries. Benchmark problems in 1D for linear elasticity,
advection-diffusion, and beam bending; and in 2D for the Poisson equation, biharmonic equation,
and the nonlinear Eikonal equation are considered. The approach extends to higher dimensions,
and we showcase its use by solving a Poisson problem with homogeneneous Dirichlet boundary conditions
over the 4D hypercube. This study provides a pathway for meshfree analysis to be conducted on the
exact geometry without domain discretization.

Large-scale antenna arrays employed by the base station (BS) constitute an essential next-generation
communications technique. However, due to the constraints of size, cost, and power consumption,
it is usually considered unrealistic to use a large-scale antenna array at the user side. Inspired
by the emerging technique of reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), we firstly propose the
concept of user-side RIS (US-RIS) for facilitating the employment of a large-scale antenna array
at the user side in a cost- and energy-efficient way. In contrast to the existing employments of RIS,
which belong to the family of base-station-side RISs (BSS-RISs), the US-RIS concept by definition
facilitates the employment of RIS at the user side for the first time. This is achieved by conceiving
a multi-layer structure to realize a compact form-factor. Furthermore, our theoretical results
demonstrate that, in contrast to the existing single-layer structure, where only the phase of the
signal reflected from RIS can be adjusted, the amplitude of the signal penetrating multi-layer
US-RIS can also be partially controlled, which brings about a new degree of freedom (DoF) for beamformer
design that can be beneficially exploited for performance enhancement. In addition, based on the
proposed multi-layer US-RIS, we formulate the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) maximization problem
of US-RIS-aided communications. Due to the non-convexity of the problem introduced by this multi-layer
structure, we propose a multi-layer transmit beamformer design relying on an iterative algorithm
for finding the optimal solution by alternately updating each variable. Finally, our simulation
results verify the superiority of the proposed multi-layer US-RIS as a compact realization of a
large-scale antenna array at the user side for uplink transmission.

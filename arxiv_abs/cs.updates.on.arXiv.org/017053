The performance of human pose estimation depends on the spatial accuracy of keypoint localization.
Most existing methods pursue the spatial accuracy through learning the high-resolution (HR) representation
from input images. By the experimental analysis, we find that the HR representation leads to a sharp
increase of computational cost, while the accuracy improvement remains marginal compared with
the low-resolution (LR) representation. In this paper, we propose a design paradigm for cost-effective
network with LR representation for efficient pose estimation, named FasterPose. Whereas the LR
design largely shrinks the model complexity, yet how to effectively train the network with respect
to the spatial accuracy is a concomitant challenge. We study the training behavior of FasterPose,
and formulate a novel regressive cross-entropy (RCE) loss function for accelerating the convergence
and promoting the accuracy. The RCE loss generalizes the ordinary cross-entropy loss from the binary
supervision to a continuous range, thus the training of pose estimation network is able to benefit
from the sigmoid function. By doing so, the output heatmap can be inferred from the LR features without
loss of spatial accuracy, while the computational cost and model size has been significantly reduced.
Compared with the previously dominant network of pose estimation, our method reduces 58% of the
FLOPs and simultaneously gains 1.3% improvement of accuracy. Extensive experiments show that
FasterPose yields promising results on the common benchmarks, i.e., COCO and MPII, consistently
validating the effectiveness and efficiency for practical utilization, especially the low-latency
and low-energy-budget applications in the non-GPU scenarios.

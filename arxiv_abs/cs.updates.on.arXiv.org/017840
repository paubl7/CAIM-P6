Cervical cancer is the fourth most common category of cancer, affecting more than 500,000 women
annually, owing to the slow detection procedure. Early diagnosis can help in treating and even curing
cancer, but the tedious, time-consuming testing process makes it impossible to conduct population-wise
screening. To aid the pathologists in efficient and reliable detection, in this paper, we propose
a fully automated computer-aided diagnosis tool for classifying single-cell and slide images
of cervical cancer. The main concern in developing an automatic detection tool for biomedical image
classification is the low availability of publicly accessible data. Ensemble Learning is a popular
approach for image classification, but simplistic approaches that leverage pre-determined weights
to classifiers fail to perform satisfactorily. In this research, we use the Sugeno Fuzzy Integral
to ensemble the decision scores from three popular pretrained deep learning models, namely, Inception
v3, DenseNet-161 and ResNet-34. The proposed Fuzzy fusion is capable of taking into consideration
the confidence scores of the classifiers for each sample, and thus adaptively changing the importance
given to each classifier, capturing the complementary information supplied by each, thus leading
to superior classification performance. We evaluated the proposed method on three publicly available
datasets, the Mendeley Liquid Based Cytology (LBC) dataset, the SIPaKMeD Whole Slide Image (WSI)
dataset, and the SIPaKMeD Single Cell Image (SCI) dataset, and the results thus yielded are promising.
Analysis of the approach using GradCAM-based visual representations and statistical tests, and
comparison of the method with existing and baseline models in literature justify the efficacy of
the approach.

The field of DNA nanotechnology has made it possible to assemble, with high yields, different structures
that have actionable properties. For example, researchers have created components that can be
actuated. An exciting next step is to combine these components into multifunctional nanorobots
that could, potentially, perform complex tasks like swimming to a target location in the human body,
detect an adverse reaction and then release a drug load to stop it. However, as we start to assemble
more complex nanorobots, the yield of the desired nanorobot begins to decrease as the number of possible
component combinations increases. Therefore, the ultimate goal of this work is to develop a predictive
model to maximize yield. However, training predictive models typically requires a large dataset.
For the nanorobots we are interested in assembling, this will be difficult to collect. This is because
high-fidelity data, which allows us to characterize the shape and size of individual structures,
is very time-consuming to collect, whereas low-fidelity data is readily available but only captures
bulk statistics for different processes. Therefore, this work combines low- and high-fidelity
data to train a generative model using a two-step process. We first use a relatively small, high-fidelity
dataset to train a generative model. At run time, the model takes low-fidelity data and uses it to
approximate the high-fidelity content. We do this by biasing the model towards samples with specific
properties as measured by low-fidelity data. In this work we bias our distribution towards a desired
node degree of a graphical model that we take as a surrogate representation of the nanorobots that
this work will ultimately focus on. We have not yet accumulated a high-fidelity dataset of nanorobots,
so we leverage the MolGAN architecture [1] and the QM9 small molecule dataset [2-3] to demonstrate
our approach.

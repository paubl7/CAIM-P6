The work presented in this paper is to propose a reliable high-quality system of Convolutional Neural
Network (CNN) for brain tumor segmentation with a low computation requirement. The system consists
of a CNN for the main processing for the segmentation, a pre-CNN block for data reduction and post-CNN
refinement block. The unique CNN consists of 7 convolution layers involving only 108 kernels and
20308 trainable parameters. It is custom-designed, following the proposed paradigm of ASCNN (application
specific CNN), to perform mono-modality and cross-modality feature extraction, tumor localization
and pixel classification. Each layer fits the task assigned to it, by means of (i) appropriate normalization
applied to its input data, (ii) correct convolution modes for the assigned task, and (iii) suitable
nonlinear transformation to optimize the convolution results. In this specific design context,
the number of kernels in each of the 7 layers is made to be just-sufficient for its task, instead of
exponentially growing over the layers, to increase information density and to reduce randomness
in the processing. The proposed activation function Full-ReLU helps to halve the number of kernels
in convolution layers of high-pass filtering without degrading processing quality. A large number
of experiments with BRATS2018 dataset have been conducted to measure the processing quality and
reproducibility of the proposed system. The results demonstrate that the system reproduces reliably
almost the same output to the same input after retraining. The mean dice scores for enhancing tumor,
whole tumor and tumor core are 77.2%, 89.2% and 76.3%, respectively. The simple structure and reliable
high processing quality of the proposed system will facilitate its implementation and medical
applications.

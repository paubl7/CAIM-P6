In order to withstand the ever-increasing invasion of privacy by CCTV cameras and technologies,
on par CCTV-aware solutions must exist that provide privacy, safety, and cybersecurity features.
We argue that a first important step towards such CCTV-aware solutions must be a mapping system that
provides both privacy and safety routing and navigation options. To the best of our knowledge, there
are no mapping nor navigation systems that support privacy and safety routing options. In this paper,
we explore the feasibility of a CCTV-aware routing and navigation solution. The aim of this feasibility
exploration is to understand what are the main impacts of CCTV on privacy, and what are the challenges
and benefits to building such technology. We evaluate our approach on seven (7) pedestrian walking
routes within the downtown area of the city of Jyvaskyla, Finland. We first map a total of 450 CCTV
cameras, and then experiment with routing and navigation under several different configurations
to coarsely model the possible cameras' parameters and coverage from the real-world. We report
two main results. First, our preliminary findings support the overall feasibility of our approach.
Second, the results also reveal a data-driven worrying reality for persons wishing to preserve
their privacy/anonymity as their main living choice. When modelling cameras at their low performance
end, a privacy-preserving route has on average a 1.5x distance increase when compared to generic
routing. When modelling cameras at their medium-to-high performance end, a privacy-preserving
route has on average a 5.0x distance increase, while in some cases there are no privacy-preserving
routes possible at all. These results further support and encourage both global mapping of CCTV
cameras and refinements to camera modelling and underlying technology.

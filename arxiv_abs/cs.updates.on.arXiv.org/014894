Online user privacy and tracking have been extensively studied in recent years, especially due
to privacy and personal data-related legislations in the EU and the USA, such as the General Data
Protection Regulation, ePrivacy Regulation, and California Consumer Privacy Act. Research has
revealed novel tracking and personal identifiable information leakage methods that first- and
third-parties employ on websites around the world, as well as the intensity of tracking performed
on such websites. However, for the sake of scaling to cover a large portion of the Web, most past studies
focused on homepages of websites, and did not look deeper into the tracking practices on their topical
subpages. The majority of studies focused on the Global North markets such as the EU and the USA. Large
markets such as India, which covers 20% of the world population and has no explicit privacy laws,
have not been studied in this regard. We aim to address these gaps and focus on the following research
questions: Is tracking on topical subpages of Indian news websites different from their homepage?
Do third-party trackers prefer to track specific topics? How does this preference compare to the
similarity of content shown on these topical subpages? To answer these questions, we propose a novel
method for automatic extraction and categorization of Indian news topical subpages based on the
details in their URLs. We study the identified topical subpages and compare them with their homepages
with respect to the intensity of cookie injection and third-party embeddedness and type. We find
differential user tracking among subpages, and between subpages and homepages. We also find a preferential
attachment of third-party trackers to specific topics. Also, embedded third-parties tend to track
specific subpages simultaneously, revealing possible user profiling in action.

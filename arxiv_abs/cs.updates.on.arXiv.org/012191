Background and Objective: Deep learning enables tremendous progress in medical image analysis.
One driving force of this progress are open-source frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. However,
these frameworks rarely address issues specific to the domain of medical image analysis, such as
3-D data handling and distance metrics for evaluation. pymia, an open-source Python package, tries
to address these issues by providing flexible data handling and evaluation independent of the deep
learning framework. Methods: The pymia package provides data handling and evaluation functionalities.
The data handling allows flexible medical image handling in every commonly used format (e.g., 2-D,
2.5-D, and 3-D; full- or patch-wise). Even data beyond images like demographics or clinical reports
can easily be integrated into deep learning pipelines. The evaluation allows stand-alone result
calculation and reporting, as well as performance monitoring during training using a vast amount
of domain-specific metrics for segmentation, reconstruction, and regression. Results: The pymia
package is highly flexible, allows for fast prototyping, and reduces the burden of implementing
data handling routines and evaluation methods. While data handling and evaluation are independent
of the deep learning framework used, they can easily be integrated into TensorFlow and PyTorch pipelines.
The developed package was successfully used in a variety of research projects for segmentation,
reconstruction, and regression. Conclusions: The pymia package fills the gap of current deep learning
frameworks regarding data handling and evaluation in medical image analysis. It is available at
https://github.com/rundherum/pymia and can directly be installed from the Python Package Index
using pip install pymia.

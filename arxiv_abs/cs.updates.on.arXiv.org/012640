With the advent of wearable technologies, Human Body Communication (HBC) has emerged as a physically
secure and power-efficient alternative to the otherwise ubiquitous Wireless Body Area Network
(WBAN). Whereas the most investigated nodes of HBC have been Electric and Electro-quasistatic
(EQS) Capacitive and Galvanic, recently Magnetic HBC (M-HBC) has been proposed as a viable alternative.
Previous works have investigated M-HBC through an application point of view, without developing
a fundamental working principle for the same. In this paper, for the first time, a ground up analysis
has been performed to study the possible effects and contributions of the human body channel in M-HBC
over a broad frequency range (1kHz to 10 GHz), by detailed electromagnetic simulations and supporting
experiments. The results show that while M-HBC can be successfully operated as a body area network,
the human body itself plays a minimal or negligible role in it's functionality. For frequencies
less than about 30 MHz, in the domain of operation of Magneto-quasistatic (MQS) HBC, the human body
is transparent to the quasistatic magnetic field. Conversely for higher frequencies, the conductive
nature of human tissues end up attenuating Magnetic HBC fields due to Eddy currents induced in body
tissues, eliminating the possibility of the body to support efficient waveguide modes. With this
better understanding at hand, different modes of operations of MQS HBC have been outlined for both
high impedance capacitive and 50 Ohm termination cases, and their performances have been compared
with EQS HBC for similar sized devices, over varying distance between TX and RX. The resulting report
presents the first fundamental understanding towards M-HBC operation and its contrast with EQS
HBC, aiding HBC device designers to make educated design decisions, depending on mode of applications.

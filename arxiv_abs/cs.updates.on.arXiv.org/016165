Natural forking in blockchain refers to a phenomenon that there are a set of blocks at one block height
at the same time, implying that various nodes have different perspectives of the main chain. Natural
forking might give rise to multiple adverse impacts on blockchain, jeopardizing the performance
and security of the system consequently. However, the ongoing literature in analyzing natural
forking is mainly from the macro point of view, which is not sufficient to incisively understand
this phenomenon. In this paper, we fill this gap through leveraging the large deviation theory to
conduct a microscopic study of natural forking, which resorts to investigating the instantaneous
difference between block generation and dissemination in blockchain. Our work is derived comprehensively
and complementarily via a three-step process, where both the natural forking probability and its
decay rate are presented. Through solid theoretical derivation and extensive numerical simulations,
we find 1) the probability of the mismatch between block generation and dissemination exceeding
a given threshold dwindles exponentially with the increase of natural forking robustness related
parameter or the difference between the block dissemination rate and block creation rate; 2) the
natural forking robustness related parameter may emphasize a more dominant effect on accelerating
the abortion of natural forking in some cases; 3) when the self-correlated block generation rate
is depicted as the stationary autoregressive process with a scaling parameter, it is found that
setting a lower scaling parameter may speed up the failure of natural forking. These findings are
valuable since they offer a fresh theoretical basis to engineer optimal countermeasures for thwarting
natural forking and thereby enlivening the blockchain network.

A total of 34% of AI research and development projects fails or are abandoned, according to a recent
survey by Rackspace Technology of 1,870 companies. We propose a new strategic framework, aiSTROM,
that empowers managers to create a successful AI strategy based on a thorough literature review.
This provides a unique and integrated approach that guides managers and lead developers through
the various challenges in the implementation process. In the aiSTROM framework, we start by identifying
the top n potential projects (typically 3-5). For each of those, seven areas of focus are thoroughly
analysed. These areas include creating a data strategy that takes into account unique cross-departmental
machine learning data requirements, security, and legal requirements. aiSTROM then guides managers
to think about how to put together an interdisciplinary artificial intelligence (AI) implementation
team given the scarcity of AI talent. Once an AI team strategy has been established, it needs to be
positioned within the organization, either cross-departmental or as a separate division. Other
considerations include AI as a service (AIaas), or outsourcing development. Looking at new technologies,
we have to consider challenges such as bias, legality of black-box-models, and keeping humans in
the loop. Next, like any project, we need value-based key performance indicators (KPIs) to track
and validate the progress. Depending on the company's risk-strategy, a SWOT analysis (strengths,
weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) can help further classify the shortlisted projects.
Finally, we should make sure that our strategy includes continuous education of employees to enable
a culture of adoption. This unique and comprehensive framework offers a valuable, literature supported,
tool for managers and lead developers.

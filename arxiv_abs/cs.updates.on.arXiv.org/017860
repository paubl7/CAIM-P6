Over the last few decades, Gyro-Free IMUs have been extensively researched to overcome the limitations
of gyroscopes. This research presents a Non-coplanar Accelerometer Array (NAA) for estimating
angular velocity with non-specific geometric arrangement of four or more triaxial accelerometers
with non-coplanarity constraint. The presented proof of non-coplanar spacial arrangement also
provides insights into propagation of the sensor noise and construction of the noise covariance
matrices. The system noise depends on the singular values of the relative displacement matrix (between
the sensors). A dynamical system model with uncorrelated process and measurement noise is proposed
where the accelerometer readings are used simultaneously as process and measurement inputs. The
angular velocity is estimated using an EKF that discretizes and linearizes the continuous-discrete
time dynamical system. The simulations are performed on a Cube-NAA (Cu-NAA) comprising four accelerometers
placed at different vertices of a cube. They analyze the estimation error for static and dynamic
movement as the distance between the accelerometers is varied. Here, the system noise is observed
to decrease inversely with the length of the cube edge as the arrangement is kept identical. Consequently,
the simulation results indicate asymptotic decrease in the standard error of estimation with edge
length. The experiments are conducted on a Cu-NAA with five reflective optical markers. The reflective
markers are visually tracked using VICON to construct the ground truth. This unique experimental
setup, apart from providing three degrees of rotational freedom of movement, also allows for three
degrees of spacial translation (linear acceleration of the Cu-NAA in space). The simulation and
experimental results indicate better performance of the proposed EKF as compared to one with correlated
process and measurement noises.

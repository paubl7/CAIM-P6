Language is a valuable source of clinical information in Alzheimer's Disease, as it declines concurrently
with neurodegeneration. Consequently, speech and language data have been extensively studied
in connection with its diagnosis. This paper summarises current findings on the use of artificial
intelligence, speech and language processing to predict cognitive decline in the context of Alzheimer's
Disease, detailing current research procedures, highlighting their limitations and suggesting
strategies to address them. We conducted a systematic review of original research between 2000
and 2019, registered in PROSPERO (reference CRD42018116606). An interdisciplinary search covered
six databases on engineering (ACM and IEEE), psychology (PsycINFO), medicine (PubMed and Embase)
and Web of Science. Bibliographies of relevant papers were screened until December 2019. From 3,654
search results 51 articles were selected against the eligibility criteria. Four tables summarise
their findings: study details (aim, population, interventions, comparisons, methods and outcomes),
data details (size, type, modalities, annotation, balance, availability and language of study),
methodology (pre-processing, feature generation, machine learning, evaluation and results)
and clinical applicability (research implications, clinical potential, risk of bias and strengths/limitations).
While promising results are reported across nearly all 51 studies, very few have been implemented
in clinical research or practice. We concluded that the main limitations of the field are poor standardisation,
limited comparability of results, and a degree of disconnect between study aims and clinical applications.
Attempts to close these gaps should support translation of future research into clinical practice.

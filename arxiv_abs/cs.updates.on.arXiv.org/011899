Purpose Automated segmentation of anatomical structures in medical image analysis is a prerequisite
for autonomous diagnosis as well as various computer and robot aided interventions. Recent methods
based on deep convolutional neural networks (CNN) have outperformed former heuristic methods.
However, those methods were primarily evaluated on rigid, real-world environments. In this study,
existing segmentation methods were evaluated for their use on a new dataset of transoral endoscopic
exploration. Methods Four machine learning based methods SegNet, UNet, ENet and ErfNet were trained
with supervision on a novel 7-class dataset of the human larynx. The dataset contains 536 manually
segmented images from two patients during laser incisions. The Intersection-over-Union (IoU)
evaluation metric was used to measure the accuracy of each method. Data augmentation and network
ensembling were employed to increase segmentation accuracy. Stochastic inference was used to
show uncertainties of the individual models. Patient-to-patient transfer was investigated using
patient-specific fine-tuning. Results In this study, a weighted average ensemble network of UNet
and ErfNet was best suited for the segmentation of laryngeal soft tissue with a mean IoU of 84.7 %.
The highest efficiency was achieved by ENet with a mean inference time of 9.22 ms per image. It is shown
that 10 additional images from a new patient are sufficient for patient-specific fine-tuning.
Conclusion CNN-based methods for semantic segmentation are applicable to endoscopic images of
laryngeal soft tissue. The segmentation can be used for active constraints or to monitor morphological
changes and autonomously detect pathologies. Further improvements could be achieved by using
a larger dataset or training the models in a self-supervised manner on additional unlabeled data.

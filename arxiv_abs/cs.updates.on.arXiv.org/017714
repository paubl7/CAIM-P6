Over the past decade, the advent of cybercrime has accelarated the research on cybersecurity. However,
the deployment of intrusion detection methods falls short. One of the reasons for this is the lack
of realistic evaluation datasets, which makes it a challenge to develop techniques and compare
them. This is caused by the large amounts of effort it takes for a cyber analyst to classify network
connections. This has raised the need for methods (i) that can learn from small sets of labeled data,
(ii) that can make predictions on large sets of unlabeled data, and (iii) that request the label of
only specially selected unlabeled data instances. Hence, Active Learning (AL) methods are of interest.
These approaches choose speci?fic unlabeled instances by a query function that are expected to
improve overall classi?cation performance. The resulting query observations are labeled by a
human expert and added to the labeled set. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid AL method called Jasmine.
Firstly, it determines how suitable each observation is for querying, i.e., how likely it is to enhance
classi?cation. These properties are the uncertainty score and anomaly score. Secondly, Jasmine
introduces dynamic updating. This allows the model to adjust the balance between querying uncertain,
anomalous and randomly selected observations. To this end, Jasmine is able to learn the best query
strategy during the labeling process. This is in contrast to the other AL methods in cybersecurity
that all have static, predetermined query functions. We show that dynamic updating, and therefore
Jasmine, is able to consistently obtain good and more robust results than querying only uncertainties,
only anomalies or a ?fixed combination of the two.

Context: Predicting software project effort from Use Case Points (UCP) method is increasingly
used among researchers and practitioners. However, unlike other effort estimation domains, this
area of interest has not been systematically reviewed. Aims: There is a need for a systemic literature
review to provide directions and supports for this research area of effort estimation. Specifically,
the objective of this study is twofold: to classify UCP effort estimation papers based on four criteria:
contribution type, research approach, dataset type and techniques used with UCP; and to analyze
these papers from different views: estimation accuracy, favorable estimation context and impact
of combined techniques on the accuracy of UCP. Method: We used the systematic literature review
methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters. This includes searching for the most relevant
papers, selecting quality papers, extracting data and drawing results. Result: The authors of
UCP research paper, are generally not aware of previous published results and conclusions in the
field of UCP effort estimation. There is a lack of UCP related publications in the top software engineering
journals. This makes a conclusion that such papers are not useful for the community. Furthermore,
most articles used small numbers of projects which cannot support generalizing the conclusion
in most cases. Conclusions: There are multiple research directions for UCP method that have not
been examined so far such as validating the algebraic construction of UCP based on industrial data.
Also, there is a need for standard automated tools that govern the process of translating use case
diagram into its corresponding UCP metrics. Although there is an increase interest among researchers
to collect industrial data and build effort prediction models based on machine learning methods,
the quality of data is still subject to debate

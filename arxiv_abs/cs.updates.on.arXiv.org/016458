With the development of computer hardware, computers with persuasion have become more powerful
and influential than ever. The latest trends show that Persuasive Technology integrates with cutting-edge
technologies, such as Natural Language Processing, Big Data, and Machine Learning algorithms.
As persuasion is becoming increasingly intelligent and subtle, it is urgent to reflect on the dark
sides of Persuasive Technology. The study aims to investigate one of Persuasive Technology's accusations,
making smartphones more addictive to its users. The study uses questionnaires and in-depth interviews
to examine the impact of persuasive technologies on young smartphone users. The participants of
the study are 18 to 26 years old Chinese university students. Questionnaires were distributed through
a university forum, student group chats, and Tencent Survey Service. Ten interviewees were sampled
randomly from the survey results. Eight interviewees shared their smartphone screen time for three
consecutive weeks after the interview. Among the 183 participants, 84.70% (n=155) spend over (or
equal to) four hours per day on their smartphone, 44.26% (n=81) indicate that smartphones negatively
affect their studies or professional life. Ten interviewees evaluated that they could reduce screen
time by 37% if they could avoid all persuasive functions. Five out of eight interviewees reduced
their screen time by 16.72% three weeks after the interviews by voluntarily turning off some persuasive
functions on their smartphones. This study provides empirical evidence to argue that persuasive
technologies increase users' screen time and contribute to the addictive behaviours of young smartphone
users. To sum up, the ethical problems that Human-computer interaction (HCI) designers face and
users' neglected rights of acknowledgement were discussed.

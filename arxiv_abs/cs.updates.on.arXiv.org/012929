Deep learning belongs to the field of artificial intelligence, where machines perform tasks that
typically require some kind of human intelligence. Deep learning tries to achieve this by mimicking
the learning of a human brain. Similar to the basic structure of a brain, which consists of (billions
of) neurons and connections between them, a deep learning algorithm consists of an artificial neural
network, which resembles the biological brain structure. Mimicking the learning process of humans
with their senses, deep learning networks are fed with (sensory) data, like texts, images, videos
or sounds. These networks outperform the state-of-the-art methods in different tasks and, because
of this, the whole field saw an exponential growth during the last years. This growth resulted in
way over 10 000 publications per year in the last years. For example, the search engine PubMed alone,
which covers only a sub-set of all publications in the medical field, provides over 11 000 results
for the search term $'$deep learning$'$ in Q3 2020, and ~90% of these results are from the last three
years. Consequently, a complete overview over the field of deep learning is already impossible
to obtain and, in the near future, it will potentially become difficult to obtain an overview over
a subfield. However, there are several review articles about deep learning, which are focused on
specific scientific fields or applications, for example deep learning advances in computer vision
or in specific tasks like object detection. With these surveys as a foundation, the aim of this contribution
is to provide a first high-level, categorized meta-analysis of selected reviews on deep learning
across different scientific disciplines and outline the research impact that they already have
during a short period of time.

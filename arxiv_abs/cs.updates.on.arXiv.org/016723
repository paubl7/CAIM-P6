Pedestrian trajectory prediction in dynamic scenes remains a challenging and critical problem
in numerous applications, such as self-driving cars and socially aware robots. Challenges concentrate
on capturing pedestrians' motion patterns and social interactions, as well as handling the future
uncertainties. Recent studies focus on modeling pedestrians' motion patterns with recurrent
neural networks, capturing social interactions with pooling-based or graph-based methods, and
handling future uncertainties by using random Gaussian noise as the latent variable. However,
they do not integrate specific obstacle avoidance experience (OAE) that may improve prediction
performance. For example, pedestrians' future trajectories are always influenced by others in
front. Here we propose GTPPO (Graph-based Trajectory Predictor with Pseudo Oracle), an encoder-decoder-based
method conditioned on pedestrians' future behaviors. Pedestrians' motion patterns are encoded
with a long short-term memory unit, which introduces the temporal attention to highlight specific
time steps. Their interactions are captured by a graph-based attention mechanism, which draws
OAE into the data-driven learning process of graph attention. Future uncertainties are handled
by generating multi-modal outputs with an informative latent variable. Such a variable is generated
by a novel pseudo oracle predictor, which minimizes the knowledge gap between historical and ground-truth
trajectories. Finally, the GTPPO is evaluated on ETH, UCY and Stanford Drone datasets, and the results
demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Besides, the qualitative evaluations show successful
cases of handling sudden motion changes in the future. Such findings indicate that GTPPO can peek
into the future.

In order to contain the COVID-19 pandemic, countries around the world have introduced social distancing
guidelines as public health interventions to reduce the spread of the disease. However, monitoring
the efficacy of these guidelines at a large scale (nationwide or worldwide) is difficult. To make
matters worse, traditional observational methods such as in-person reporting is dangerous because
observers may risk infection. A better solution is to observe activities through network cameras;
this approach is scalable and observers can stay in safe locations. This research team has created
methods that can discover thousands of network cameras worldwide, retrieve data from the cameras,
analyze the data, and report the sizes of crowds as different countries issued and lifted restrictions
(also called ''lockdown''). We discover 11,140 network cameras that provide real-time data and
we present the results across 15 countries. We collect data from these cameras beginning April 2020
at approximately 0.5TB per week. After analyzing 10,424,459 images from still image cameras and
frames extracted periodically from video, the data reveals that the residents in some countries
exhibited more activity (judged by numbers of people and vehicles) after the restrictions were
lifted. In other countries, the amounts of activities showed no obvious changes during the restrictions
and after the restrictions were lifted. The data further reveals whether people stay ''social distancing'',
at least 6 feet apart. This study discerns whether social distancing is being followed in several
types of locations and geographical locations worldwide and serve as an early indicator whether
another wave of infections is likely to occur soon.

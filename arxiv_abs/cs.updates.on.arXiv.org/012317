E-learning in higher education is exponentially increased during the past decade due to its inevitable
benefits in critical situations like natural disasters, and pandemic. The reliable, fair, and
seamless execution of online exams in E-learning is highly significant. Particularly, online
exams are conducted on E-learning platforms without the physical presence of students and instructors
at the same place. This poses several issues like integrity and security during online exams. To
address such issues, researchers frequently proposed different techniques and tools. However,
a study summarizing and analyzing latest developments, particularly in the area of online examination,
is hard to find in the literature. In this article, an SLR for online examination is performed to select
and analyze 53 studies published during the last five years. Subsequently, five leading online
exams features targeted in the selected studies are identified and underlying development approaches
for the implementation of online exams solutions are explored. Furthermore, 16 important techniques
and 11 datasets are presented. In addition, 21 online exams tools proposed in the selected studies
are identified. Additionally, 25 leading existing tools used in the selected studies are also presented.
Finally, the participation of countries in online exam research is investigated. Key factors for
the global adoption of online exams are identified and investigated. This facilitates the selection
of right online exam system for a particular country on the basis of existing E-learning infrastructure
and overall cost. To conclude, the findings of this article provide a solid platform for the researchers
and practitioners of the domain to select appropriate features along with underlying development
approaches, tools and techniques for the implementation of a particular online exams solution
as per given requirements.

We propose how a developing country like Sri Lanka can benefit from privacy-enabled machine learning
techniques such as Federated Learning to detect road conditions using crowd-sourced data collection
and proposed the idea of implementing a Digital Twin for the national road system in Sri Lanka. Developing
countries such as Sri Lanka are far behind in implementing smart road systems and smart cities compared
to the developed countries. The proposed work discussed in this paper matches the UN Sustainable
Development Goal (SDG) 9: "Build Resilient Infrastructure, Promote Inclusive and Sustainable
Industrialization and Foster Innovation". Our proposed work discusses how the government and
private sector vehicles that conduct routine trips to collect crowd-sourced data using smartphone
devices to identify the road conditions and detect where the potholes, surface unevenness (roughness),
and other major distresses are located on the roads. We explore Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) techniques
that can bring machine learning intelligence closer to the edge devices where produced data is stored
and show how the applications of Federated Learning can be made to detect and improve road conditions.
During the second phase of this study, we plan to implement a Digital Twin for the road system in Sri
Lanka. We intend to use data provided by both Dedicated and Non-Dedicated systems in the proposed
Digital Twin for the road system. As of writing this paper, and best to our knowledge, there is no Digital
Twin system implemented for roads and other infrastructure systems in Sri Lanka. The proposed Digital
Twin will be one of the first implementations of such systems in Sri Lanka. Lessons learned from this
pilot project will benefit other developing countries who wish to follow the same path and make data-driven
decisions.

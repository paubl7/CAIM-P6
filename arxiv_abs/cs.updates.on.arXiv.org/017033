In neuroimaging, MRI tissue properties characterize underlying neurobiology, provide quantitative
biomarkers for neurological disease detection and analysis, and can be used to synthesize arbitrary
MRI contrasts. Estimating tissue properties from a single scan session using a protocol available
on all clinical scanners promises to reduce scan time and cost, enable quantitative analysis in
routine clinical scans and provide scan-independent biomarkers of disease. However, existing
tissue properties estimation methods - most often $\mathbf{T_1}$ relaxation, $\mathbf{T_2^*}$
relaxation, and proton density ($\mathbf{PD}$) - require data from multiple scan sessions and
cannot estimate all properties from a single clinically available MRI protocol such as the multiecho
MRI scan. In addition, the widespread use of non-standard acquisition parameters across clinical
imaging sites require estimation methods that can generalize across varying scanner parameters.
However, existing learning methods are acquisition protocol specific and cannot estimate from
heterogenous clinical data from different imaging sites. In this work we propose an unsupervised
deep-learning strategy that employs MRI physics to estimate all three tissue properties from a
single multiecho MRI scan session, and generalizes across varying acquisition parameters. The
proposed strategy optimizes accurate synthesis of new MRI contrasts from estimated latent tissue
properties, enabling unsupervised training, we also employ random acquisition parameters during
training to achieve acquisition generalization. We provide the first demonstration of estimating
all tissue properties from a single multiecho scan session. We demonstrate improved accuracy and
generalizability for tissue property estimation and MRI synthesis.

Nutrition is a key determinant of long-term health, and social influence has long been theorized
to be a key determinant of nutrition. It has been difficult to quantify the postulated role of social
influence on nutrition using traditional methods such as surveys, due to the typically small scale
and short duration of studies. To overcome these limitations, we leverage a novel source of data:
logs of 38 million food purchases made over an 8-year period on the Ecole Polytechnique Federale
de Lausanne (EPFL) university campus, linked to anonymized individuals via the smartcards used
to make on-campus purchases. In a longitudinal observational study, we ask: How is a person's food
choice affected by eating with someone else whose own food choice is healthy vs. unhealthy? To estimate
causal effects from the passively observed log data, we control confounds in a matched quasi-experimental
design: we identify focal users who at first do not have any regular eating partners but then start
eating with a fixed partner regularly, and we match focal users into comparison pairs such that paired
users are nearly identical with respect to covariates measured before acquiring the partner, where
the two focal users' new eating partners diverge in the healthiness of their respective food choice.
A difference-in-differences analysis of the paired data yields clear evidence of social influence:
focal users acquiring a healthy-eating partner change their habits significantly more toward
healthy foods than focal users acquiring an unhealthy-eating partner. We further identify foods
whose purchase frequency is impacted significantly by the eating partner's healthiness of food
choice. Beyond the main results, the work demonstrates the utility of passively sensed food purchase
logs for deriving insights, with the potential of informing the design of public health interventions
and food offerings.

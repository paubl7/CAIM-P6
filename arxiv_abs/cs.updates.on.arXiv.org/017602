Domain adaptation (DA) has drawn high interest for its capacity to adapt a model trained on labeled
source data to perform well on unlabeled or weakly labeled target data from a different domain. Most
common DA techniques require concurrent access to the input images of both the source and target
domains. However, in practice, privacy concerns often impede the availability of source images
in the adaptation phase. This is a very frequent DA scenario in medical imaging, where, for instance,
the source and target images could come from different clinical sites. We introduce a source-free
domain adaptation for image segmentation. Our formulation is based on minimizing a label-free
entropy loss defined over target-domain data, which we further guide with a domain-invariant prior
on the segmentation regions. Many priors can be derived from anatomical information. Here, a class
ratio prior is estimated from anatomical knowledge and integrated in the form of a Kullback Leibler
(KL) divergence in our overall loss function. Furthermore, we motivate our overall loss with an
interesting link to maximizing the mutual information between the target images and their label
predictions. We show the effectiveness of our prior aware entropy minimization in a variety of domain-adaptation
scenarios, with different modalities and applications, including spine, prostate, and cardiac
segmentation. Our method yields comparable results to several state of the art adaptation techniques,
despite having access to much less information, as the source images are entirely absent in our adaptation
phase. Our straightforward adaptation strategy uses only one network, contrary to popular adversarial
techniques, which are not applicable to a source-free DA setting. Our framework can be readily used
in a breadth of segmentation problems, and our code is publicly available: https://github.com/mathilde-b/SFDA

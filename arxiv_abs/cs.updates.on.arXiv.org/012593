The use of mobile applications apps and GPS service on smartphones for transportation management
applications has enabled the new "on-demand mobility" service, where the transportation supply
is following the users' schedule and routes. In September 2018, the City of Belleville in Canada
and Pantonium operationalized the same idea, but for the public transit service in the city to develop
an on-demand transit (ODT) service. An existing fixed route (RT 11) public transit service was converted
into an on-demand service during the night as a pilot project to maintain a higher demand sensitivity
and highest operation cost efficiency per trip. In this study, Random Forest (RF), Bagging, Artificial
Neural Network (ANN), and Deep Neural Network (DNN) machine learning algorithms were adopted to
develop a pickup demand model (trip generation) and a trip demand model (trip distribution model)
for Belleville ODT service based on the dissemination areas' demographic characteristics and
the existing trip characteristics. The developed models aim to explain the demand behavior, investigate
the main factors affecting the trip pattern and their relative importance, and to predict the number
of generated trips from any dissemination area as well as between any two dissemination areas. The
results indicate that the developed models can predict 63% and 70% of the pickup and trip demand levels,
respectively. Both models are most affected by the month of the year and the day of the week variables.
In addition, the population density has a higher impact on the ODT service pickup demand levels than
the other demographic characteristics followed by the working age percentages and median income
characteristics. Whereas, the distribution of the trips depends on the demographic characteristics
of the destination area more than the origin area.

There are numerous peptides discovered through past decades, which exhibit antimicrobial and
anti-cancerous tendencies. Due to these reasons, peptides are supposed to be sound therapeutic
candidates. Some peptides can pose low metabolic stability, high toxicity and high hemolity of
peptides. This highlights the importance for evaluating hemolytic tendencies and toxicity of
peptides, before using them for therapeutics. Traditional methods for evaluation of toxicity
of peptides can be time-consuming and costly. In this study, we have extracted peptides data (Hemo-DB)
from Database of Antimicrobial Activity and Structure of Peptides (DBAASP) based on certain hemolity
criteria and we present a machine learning based method for prediction of hemolytic tendencies
of peptides (i.e. Hemolytic or Non-Hemolytic). Our model offers significant improvement on hemolity
prediction benchmarks. we also propose a reliable clustering-based train-tests splitting method
which ensures that no peptide in train set is more than 40% similar to any peptide in test set. Using
this train-test split, we can get reliable estimated of expected model performance on unseen data
distribution or newly discovered peptides. Our model tests 0.9986 AUC-ROC (Area Under Receiver
Operating Curve) and 97.79% Accuracy on test set of Hemo-DB using traditional random train-test
splitting method. Moreover, our model tests AUC-ROC of 0.997 and Accuracy of 97.58% while using
clustering-based train-test data split. Furthermore, we check our model on an unseen data distribution
(at Hemo-PI 3) and we recorded 0.8726 AUC-ROC and 79.5% accuracy. Using the proposed method, potential
therapeutic peptides can be screened, which may further in therapeutics and get reliable predictions
for unseen amino acids distribution of peptides and newly discovered peptides.

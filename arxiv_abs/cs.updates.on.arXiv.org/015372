Building operations represent a significant percentage of the total primary energy consumed in
most countries due to the proliferation of Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) installations
in response to the growing demand for improved thermal comfort. Reducing the associated energy
consumption while maintaining comfortable conditions in buildings are conflicting objectives
and represent a typical optimization problem that requires intelligent system design. Over the
last decade, different methodologies based on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques have
been deployed to find the sweet spot between energy use in HVAC systems and suitable indoor comfort
levels to the occupants. This paper performs a comprehensive and an in-depth systematic review
of AI-based techniques used for building control systems by assessing the outputs of these techniques,
and their implementations in the reviewed works, as well as investigating their abilities to improve
the energy-efficiency, while maintaining thermal comfort conditions. This enables a holistic
view of (1) the complexities of delivering thermal comfort to users inside buildings in an energy-efficient
way, and (2) the associated bibliographic material to assist researchers and experts in the field
in tackling such a challenge. Among the 20 AI tools developed for both energy consumption and comfort
control, functions such as identification and recognition patterns, optimization, predictive
control. Based on the findings of this work, the application of AI technology in building control
is a promising area of research and still an ongoing, i.e., the performance of AI-based control is
not yet completely satisfactory. This is mainly due in part to the fact that these algorithms usually
need a large amount of high-quality real-world data, which is lacking in the building or, more precisely,
the energy sector.

The extensive use of the internet is continuously drifting businesses to incorporate their services
in the online environment. One of the first spectrums to embrace this evolution was the banking sector.
In fact, the first known online banking service came in 1980. It was deployed from a community bank
located in Knoxville, called the United American Bank. Since then, internet banking has been offering
ease and efficiency to costumers in completing their daily banking tasks. The ever increasing use
of internet banking and a large number of online transactions increased fraudulent behavior also.
As if fraud increase was not enough, the massive number of online transactions further increased
the data complexity. Modern data sources are not only complex but generated at high speed and in real-time
as well. This presents a serious problem and a definite reason why more advanced solutions are desired
to protect financial service companies and credit cardholders. Therefore, this research paper
aims to construct an efficient fraud detection model which is adaptive to customer behavior changes
and tends to decrease fraud manipulation, by detecting and filtering fraud in real-time. In order
to achieve this aim, a review of various methods is conducted, adding above a personal experience
working in the Banking sector, specifically in the Fraud Detection office. Unlike the majority
of reviewed methods, the proposed model in this research paper is able to detect fraud in the moment
of occurrence using an incremental classifier. The evaluation of synthetic data, based on fraud
scenarios selected in collaboration with domain experts that replicate typical, real-world attacks,
shows that this approach correctly ranks complex frauds. In particular, our proposal detects fraudulent
behavior and anomalies with up to 97\% detection rate while maintaining a satisfyingly low cost.

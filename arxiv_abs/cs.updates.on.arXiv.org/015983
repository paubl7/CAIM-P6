The random-cluster model is a unifying framework for studying random graphs, spin systems and electrical
networks that plays a fundamental role in designing efficient Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling
algorithms for the classical ferromagnetic Ising and Potts models. In this paper, we study a natural
non-local Markov chain known as the Chayes-Machta dynamics for the mean-field case of the random-cluster
model, where the underlying graph is the complete graph on $n$ vertices. The random-cluster model
is parametrized by an it edge probability $p$ and a cluster weight $q$. Our focus is on the critical
regime: $p = p_c(q)$ and $q \in (1,2)$, where $p_c(q)$ is the threshold corresponding to the order-disorder
phase transition of the model. We show that the mixing time of the Chayes-Machta dynamics is $O(\log
n \cdot \log \log n)$ in this parameter regime, which reveals that the dynamics does not undergo an
exponential slowdown at criticality, a surprising fact that had been predicted (but not proved)
by statistical physicists. This also provides a nearly optimal bound (up to the $\log\log n$ factor)
for the mixing time of the mean-field Chayes-Machta dynamics in the only regime of parameters where
no non-trivial bound was previously known. Our proof consists of a multi-phased coupling argument
that combines several key ingredients, including a new local limit theorem, a precise bound on the
maximum of symmetric random walks with varying step sizes, and tailored estimates for critical
random graphs. In addition, we derive an improved comparison inequality between the mixing time
of the Chayes-Machta dynamics and that of the local Glauber dynamics on general graphs; this results
in better mixing time bounds for the local dynamics in the mean-field setting.

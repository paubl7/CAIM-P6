Recent advancements in the cloud computing domain have resulted in huge strides toward simplifying
the procurement of hardware and software for diverse needs. By moving enterprise workloads to managed
cloud offerings (private, public, hybrid), customers are delegating mundane tasks and labor-intensive
maintenance activities related to network connectivity, procurement of cloud resource, application
deployment, software patches, and upgrades, etc., This often translates to benefits such as high
availability and reduced cost. The popularity of container and micro-services-based deployment
has made Kubernetes the de-facto standard to deliver applications. However, even with Kubernetes
orchestration, cloud service providers frequently have operational scalability issues due to
lack of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CICD) automation and increased demand
for human operators when managing a large number of software deployments across multiple data centers/availability
zones. Kubernetes solves this in a novel way by creating and managing custom applications using
Operators. Agile methodology advocates incremental CICD which are adopted by cloud providers.
However, ironically, it is this same continuous delivery feature of application updates, Kubernetes
cluster upgrades, etc., that is also a bane to cloud providers. In this paper, we will demonstrate
the use of IBM open-source project Razee as a scalable continuous deployment framework to deploy
open-source RStudio and Nginx Operators. We will discuss how IBM Watson SaaS application Operator,
Blockchain applications, and Kubernetes resources updates, etc., can be deployed similarly and
the use of Operators to perform application life cycle management. We assert that using Razee in
conjunction with Operators on Kubernetes simplifies application life cycle management and increases
scalability.

Parametric timed automata (PTA) are an extension of timed automata in which clocks can be compared
against parameters. The reachability problem asks for the existence of an assignment of the parameters
to the non-negative integers such that reachability holds in the underlying timed automaton. The
reachability problem for PTA is long known to be undecidable, already over three parametric clocks.
A few years ago, Bundala and Ouaknine proved that for PTA over two parametric clocks and one parameter
the reachability problem is decidable and also showed a lower bound for the complexity class PSPACE^NEXP.
Our main result is that the reachability problem for two-parametric timed automata with one parameter
is EXPSPACE-complete. Our contribution is two-fold. For the EXPSPACE lower bound we make use of
deep results from complexity theory, namely a serializability characterization of EXPSPACE (based
on Barrington's Theorem) and a logspace translation of numbers in chinese remainder representation
to binary representation. For the EXPSPACE upper bound, we give a careful exponential time reduction
from PTA over two parametric clocks and one parameter to a slight subclass of parametric one-counter
automata (POCA) over one parameter based on a minor adjustment of a construction due to Bundala and
Ouaknine. We provide a series of techniques to partition a fictitious run of a POCA into several carefully
chosen subruns that allow us to prove that it is sufficient to consider a parameter value of exponential
magnitude only. This allows us to show a doubly-exponential upper bound on the value of the only parameter
of a PTA over two parametric clocks and one parameter. We hope that extensions of our techniques lead
to finally establishing decidability of the long-standing open problem of reachability in parametric
timed automata with two parametric clocks (and arbitrarily many parameters).

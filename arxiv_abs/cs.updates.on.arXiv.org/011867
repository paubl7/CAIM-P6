Mental health problems among the global population are worsened during the coronavirus disease
(COVID-19). How individuals engage with online platforms such as Google Search and YouTube undergoes
drastic shifts due to pandemic and subsequent lockdowns. Such ubiquitous daily behaviors on online
platforms have the potential to capture and correlate with clinically alarming deteriorations
in mental health profiles in a non-invasive manner. The goal of this study is to examine, among college
students, the relationship between deteriorating mental health conditions and changes in user
behaviors when engaging with Google Search and YouTube during COVID-19. This study recruited a
cohort of 49 students from a U.S. college campus during January 2020 (prior to the pandemic) and measured
the anxiety and depression levels of each participant. This study followed up with the same cohort
during May 2020 (during the pandemic), and the anxiety and depression levels were assessed again.
The longitudinal Google Search and YouTube history data were anonymized and collected. From individual-level
Google Search and YouTube histories, we developed 5 signals that can quantify shifts in online behaviors
during the pandemic. We then assessed the differences between groups with and without deteriorating
mental health profiles in terms of these features. Significant features included late-night online
activities, continuous usages, and time away from the internet, porn consumptions, and keywords
associated with negative emotions, social activities, and personal affairs. Though further studies
are required, our results demonstrated the feasibility of utilizing pervasive online data to establish
non-invasive surveillance systems for mental health conditions that bypasses many disadvantages
of existing screening methods.

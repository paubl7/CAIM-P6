Community search aims at finding densely connected subgraphs for query vertices in a graph. While
this task has been studied widely in the literature, most of the existing works only focus on finding
homogeneous communities rather than heterogeneous communities with different labels. In this
paper, we motivate a new problem of cross-group community search, namely Butterfly-Core Community
(BCC), over a labeled graph, where each vertex has a label indicating its properties and an edge between
two vertices indicates their cross relationship. Specifically, for two query vertices with different
labels, we aim to find a densely connected cross community that contains two query vertices and consists
of butterfly networks, where each wing of the butterflies is induced by a k-core search based on one
query vertex and two wings are connected by these butterflies. Indeed, the BCC structure admits
the structure cohesiveness and minimum diameter, and thus can effectively capture the heterogeneous
and concise collaborative team. Moreover, we theoretically prove this problem is NP-hard and analyze
its non-approximability. To efficiently tackle the problem, we develop a heuristic algorithm,
which first finds a BCC containing the query vertices, then iteratively removes the farthest vertices
to the query vertices from the graph. The algorithm can achieve a 2-approximation to the optimal
solution. To further improve the efficiency, we design a butterfly-core index and develop a suite
of efficient algorithms for butterfly-core identification and maintenance as vertices are eliminated.
Extensive experiments on eight real-world networks and four novel case studies validate the effectiveness
and efficiency of our algorithms.

Recent embedded systems are designed with high-performance System-on-Chips (SoCs) to satisfy
the computational needs of complex applications widely used in real life, such as airplane controllers,
autonomous driving automobiles, medical devices, drones, and hand-held devices. Modern SoCs
integrate multi-core CPUs and various types of accelerators including GPUs and DSPs. Uncontrolled
heat dissipation is one of the main sources of interference that can adversely affect the reliability
and real-time performance of safety-critical applications. The mechanisms currently available
to protect SoCs from overheating, such as frequency throttling or core shutdown, may exacerbate
the problem as they cause unpredictable delay and deadline misses. Dynamic changes in ambient temperature
further increase the difficulty of solving this problem. This dissertation addresses the challenges
caused by thermal interference in real-time mixed-criticality systems built with heterogeneous
embedded SoC platforms. We propose a novel thermal-aware system framework with analytical timing
and thermal models to guarantee safe execution of real-time tasks under the thermal constraints
of a multi-core CPU/GPU integrated SoC. For mixed-criticality tasks, the proposed framework bounds
the heat generation of the system at each criticality level and provides different levels of assurance
against ambient temperature changes. In addition, we propose a data-driven thermal parameter
estimation scheme that is directly applicable to MCSs built with commercial-off-the-shelf multi-core
processors to obtain a precise thermal model without using special measurement instruments or
access to proprietary information. The practicality and effectiveness of our solutions have been
evaluated using real SoC platforms and our contributions will help develop systems with thermal
safety and real-time predictability.

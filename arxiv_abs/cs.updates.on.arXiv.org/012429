Modern software development and operations rely on monitoring to understand how systems behave
in production. Despite the rich ecosystem around industry-ready log solutions, monitoring complex
systems and getting insights from log data remains a challenge. Researchers and practitioners
have been actively working to address several challenges related to logs, e.g., how to effectively
provide better tooling support for logging decisions to developers, how to effectively process
and store log data, and how to extract insights from log data. In this paper, we provide a holistic
view of the logging research field to give directions and disseminate the state-of-the-art. We
conduct a systematic mapping study based on five popular data sources and derive a classification
schema based on the abstract keywording to structure the research field in light to the life-cycle
of log data (i.e., generation, processing, and analysis of log data). We discovered 108 papers published
in highly ranked venues, spanning different communities (e.g., machine learning, software engineering,
and systems). In summary, 24 papers focus on the development of effective logging code, 16 papers
focus of parsing techniques and efficient storage to enable log analysis, and 68 papers focus on
extracting insights from log data. We further subdivide those three categories according to their
use case (e.g., log analysis for failure prediction). Our analysis shows that logging is challenge
in open source and industry contexts, machine learning is a promising approach to enable contextual
analysis of source code for log recommendation but requires further investigation to assess the
usability of those tools in practice, few studies approached efficient persistence of log data,
and there are open opportunities to analyse application logs and to evaluate state-of-the-art
log analysis techniques in a DevOps context.

Smart devices have accentuated the importance of geolocation information. Geolocation identification
using smart devices has paved the path for incentive-based location-based services (LBS). A location
proof is a digital certificate of the geographical location of a user, which can be used to access
various LBS. However, a user full control over a device allows the tampering of location proof. Initially,
to resist false proofs, two-party trusted centralized location proof systems (LPS) were introduced
to aid the users in generating secure location proofs mutually. However, two-party protocols suffered
from the collusion attacks by the participants of the protocol. Consequently, many witness-oriented
LPS have emerged to mitigate collusion attacks in two-party protocols. However, witness-oriented
LPS presented the possibility of three-way collusion attacks (involving the user, location authority,
and the witness). The three-way collusion attacks are inevitable in all existing witness-oriented
schemes. To mitigate the inability to resist three-way collusion of existing schemes, in this paper,
we introduce a decentralized consensus protocol called as MobChain, where the selection of a witness
and location authority is achieved through a distributed consensus of nodes in an underlying P2P
network of a private blockchain. The persistent provenance data over the blockchain provides strong
security guarantees, as a result, the forging and manipulation become impractical. MobChain provides
secure location provenance architecture, relying on decentralized decision making for the selection
of participants of the protocol to resist three-way collusion problem. Our prototype implementation
and comparison with the state-of-the-art solutions show that MobChain is computationally efficient,
highly available while improving the security of LPS.

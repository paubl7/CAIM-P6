Intracranial hemorrhage occurs when blood vessels rupture or leak within the brain tissue or elsewhere
inside the skull. It can be caused by physical trauma or by various medical conditions and in many
cases leads to death. The treatment must be started as soon as possible, and therefore the hemorrhage
should be diagnosed accurately and quickly. The diagnosis is usually performed by a radiologist
who analyses a Computed Tomography (CT) scan containing a large number of cross-sectional images
throughout the brain. Analysing each image manually can be very time-consuming, but automated
techniques can help speed up the process. While much of the recent research has focused on solving
this problem by using supervised machine learning algorithms, publicly-available training data
remains scarce due to privacy concerns. This problem can be alleviated by unsupervised algorithms.
In this paper, we propose a fully-unsupervised algorithm which is based on the mixture models. Our
algorithm utilizes the fact that the properties of hemorrhage and healthy tissues follow different
distributions, and therefore an appropriate formulation of these distributions allows us to separate
them through an Expectation-Maximization process. In addition, our algorithm is able to adaptively
determine the number of clusters such that all the hemorrhage regions can be found without including
noisy voxels. We demonstrate the results of our algorithm on publicly-available datasets that
contain all different hemorrhage types in various sizes and intensities, and our results are compared
to earlier unsupervised and supervised algorithms. The results show that our algorithm can outperform
the other algorithms with most hemorrhage types.

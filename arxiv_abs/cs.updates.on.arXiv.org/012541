Estimating the number of signals embedded in noise is a fundamental problem in array signal processing.
The classic RMT estimator based on random matrix theory (RMT) tends to under-estimate the number
of signals as it does not consider the non-negligible bias term among eigenvalues for finite sample
size. Moreover, the RMT estimator suffers from uncertainty in noise variance estimation problem.
In order to overcome these problems, we firstly derive a more accurate expression for the distribution
of the sample eigenvalues and the bias term among eigenvalues by utilizing the linear shrinkage
(LS) estimate of noise sample eigenvalues. Then, we analyze the effect of the bias term among eigenvalues
on the estimation performance of the RMT estimator, and derive the increased under-estimation
probability of the RMT estimator incurred by this bias term. Based on these results, we propose a
novel RMT estimator based on LS estimate of noise eigenvalues (termed as LS-RMT estimator) by incorporating
the bias term into the decision criterion of the RMT estimator. As the LS-RMT estimator incorporates
this bias term among eigenvalues into the decision criterion of the RMT estimator, it can detect
signal eigenvalues immersed in this bias term. Therefore, the LS-RMT estimator can overcome the
higher under-estimation probability of the RMT estimator incurred by the bias term among eigenvalues,
and also avoids the uncertainty in the noise variance estimation suffered by the RMT estimator as
the noise variance is estimated under the assumption that the eigenvalue being tested is arising
from noise. Finally, extensive simulation results are presented to show that the proposed LS-RMT
estimator outperforms the existing estimators.

Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiographs (TOF-MRAs) enable visualization and analysis
of cerebral arteries. This analysis may indicate normal variation of the configuration of the cerebrovascular
system or vessel abnormalities, such as aneurysms. A model would be useful to represent normal cerebrovascular
structure and variabilities in a healthy population and to differentiate from abnormalities.
Current anomaly detection using autoencoding convolutional neural networks usually use a voxelwise
mean-error for optimization. We propose optimizing a variational-autoencoder (VAE) with structural
similarity loss (SSIM) for TOF-MRA reconstruction. A patch-trained 2D fully-convolutional VAE
was optimized for TOF-MRA reconstruction by comparing vessel segmentations of original and reconstructed
MRAs. The method was trained and tested on two datasets: the IXI dataset, and a subset from the ADAM
challenge. Both trained networks were tested on a dataset including subjects with aneurysms. We
compared VAE optimization with L2-loss and SSIM-loss. Performance was evaluated between original
and reconstructed MRAs using mean square error, mean-SSIM, peak-signal-to-noise-ratio and dice
similarity index (DSI) of segmented vessels. The L2-optimized VAE outperforms SSIM, with improved
reconstruction metrics and DSIs for both datasets. Optimization using SSIM performed best for
visual image quality, but with discrepancy in quantitative reconstruction and vascular segmentation.
The larger, more diverse IXI dataset had overall better performance. Reconstruction metrics,
including SSIM, were lower for MRAs including aneurysms. A SSIM-optimized VAE improved the visual
perceptive image quality of TOF-MRA reconstructions. A L2-optimized VAE performed best for TOF-MRA
reconstruction, where the vascular segmentation is important. SSIM is a potential metric for anomaly
detection of MRAs.

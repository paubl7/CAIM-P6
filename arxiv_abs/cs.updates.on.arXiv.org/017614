Human biases impact the way people analyze data and make decisions. Recent work has shown that some
visualization designs can better support cognitive processes and mitigate cognitive biases (i.e.,
errors that occur due to the use of mental "shortcuts"). In this work, we explore how visualizing
a user's interaction history (i.e., which data points and attributes a user has interacted with)
can be used to mitigate potential biases that drive decision making by promoting conscious reflection
of one's analysis process. Given an interactive scatterplot-based visualization tool, we showed
interaction history in real-time while exploring data (by coloring points in the scatterplot that
the user has interacted with), and in a summative format after a decision has been made (by comparing
the distribution of user interactions to the underlying distribution of the data). We conducted
a series of in-lab experiments and a crowd-sourced experiment to evaluate the effectiveness of
interaction history interventions toward mitigating bias. We contextualized this work in a political
scenario in which participants were instructed to choose a committee of 10 fictitious politicians
to review a recent bill passed in the U.S. state of Georgia banning abortion after 6 weeks, where things
like gender bias or political party bias may drive one's analysis process. We demonstrate the generalizability
of this approach by evaluating a second decision making scenario related to movies. Our results
are inconclusive for the effectiveness of interaction history (henceforth referred to as interaction
traces) toward mitigating biased decision making. However, we find some mixed support that interaction
traces, particularly in a summative format, can increase awareness of potential unconscious biases.

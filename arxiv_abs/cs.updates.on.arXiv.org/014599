The goal of this paper is to develop a modeling framework that captures the inter-decision dynamics
between mobility service providers (MSPs) and travelers that can be used to optimize and analyze
policies/regulations related to MSPs. To meet this goal, the paper proposes a tri-level mathematical
programming model with a public-sector decision maker (regulator) at the highest level, the MSP
in the middle level, and travelers at the lowest level. The regulator aims to maximize social welfare
via implementing regulations, policies, plans, transit service designs, etc. The MSP aims to maximize
profit by adjusting its service designs. Travelers aim to maximize utility by changing their modes
and routes. The travelers' decisions depend on the regulator and MSP's decisions while the MSP decisions
themselves depend on the regulator's decisions. To solve the tri-level mathematical program,
the study employs Bayesian optimization (BO) within a simulation-optimization solution approach.
At the lowest level, the solution approach includes an agent-based transportation system simulation
model to capture travelers' behavior subject to specific decisions made by the regulator and MSP.
The agent-based transportation simulation model includes a mode choice model, a road network,
a transit network, and an MSP providing automated mobility-on-demand (AMOD) service with shared
rides. The modeling and solution approaches are applied to Munich, Germany in order to validate
the model. The case study investigates the tolls and parking costs the city administration should
set, as well as changes in the public transport budget and a limitation of the AMOD fleet size. Best
policy settings are derived for two social welfare definitions, in both of which the AMOD fleet size
is not regulated as the shared-ride AMOD service provides significant value to travelers in Munich.

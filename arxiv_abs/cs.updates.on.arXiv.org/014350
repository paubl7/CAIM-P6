A novel approach to reduced-order modeling of high-dimensional time varying systems is proposed.
It leverages the formalism of the Dynamic Mode Decomposition technique together with the concept
of balanced realization. It is assumed that the only information available on the system comes from
input, state, and output trajectories generated by numerical simulations or recorded and estimated
during experiments, thus the approach is fully data-driven. The goal is to obtain an input-output
low dimensional linear model which approximates the system across its operating range. Since the
dynamics of aeroservoelastic systems markedly changes in operation (e.g. due to change in flight
speed or altitude), time-varying features are retained in the constructed models. This is achieved
by generating a Linear Parameter-Varying representation made of a collection of state-consistent
linear time-invariant reduced-order models. The algorithm formulation hinges on the idea of replacing
the orthogonal projection onto the Proper Orthogonal Decomposition modes, used in Dynamic Mode
Decomposition-based approaches, with a balancing oblique projection constructed entirely from
data. As a consequence, the input-output information captured in the lower-dimensional representation
is increased compared to other projections onto subspaces of same or lower size. Moreover, a parameter-varying
projection is possible while also achieving state-consistency. The validity of the proposed approach
is demonstrated on a morphing wing for airborne wind energy applications by comparing the performance
against two algorithms recently proposed in the literature. Comparisons cover both prediction
accuracy and performance in model predictive control applications.

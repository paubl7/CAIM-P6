Prostate cancer (PCa) is one of the leading causes of death for men worldwide. Multi-parametric
magnetic resonance (mpMR) imaging has emerged as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for detecting
and localising prostate tumours by specialised radiologists. These radiological examinations,
for example, for differentiating malignant lesions from benign prostatic hyperplasia in transition
zones and for defining the boundaries of clinically significant cancer, remain challenging and
highly skill-and-experience-dependent. We first investigate experimental results in developing
object detection neural networks that are trained to predict the radiological assessment, using
these high-variance labels. We further argue that such a computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) system
needs to have the ability to control the false-positive rate (FPR) or false-negative rate (FNR),
in order to be usefully deployed in a clinical workflow, informing clinical decisions without further
human intervention. This work proposes a novel PCa detection network that incorporates a lesion-level
cost-sensitive loss and an additional slice-level loss based on a lesion-to-slice mapping function,
to manage the lesion- and slice-level costs, respectively. Our experiments based on 290 clinical
patients concludes that 1) The lesion-level FNR was effectively reduced from 0.19 to 0.10 and the
lesion-level FPR was reduced from 1.03 to 0.66 by changing the lesion-level cost; 2) The slice-level
FNR was reduced from 0.19 to 0.00 by taking into account the slice-level cost; (3) Both lesion-level
and slice-level FNRs were reduced with lower FP/FPR by changing the lesion-level or slice-level
costs, compared with post-training threshold adjustment using networks without the proposed
cost-aware training.

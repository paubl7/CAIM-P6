I describe the rationale for, and design of, an agent-based simulation model of a contemporary online
sports-betting exchange: such exchanges, closely related to the exchange mechanisms at the heart
of major financial markets, have revolutionized the gambling industry in the past 20 years, but
gathering sufficiently large quantities of rich and temporally high-resolution data from real
exchanges - i.e., the sort of data that is needed in large quantities for Deep Learning - is often very
expensive, and sometimes simply impossible; this creates a need for a plausibly realistic synthetic
data generator, which is what this simulation now provides. The simulator, named the "Bristol Betting
Exchange" (BBE), is intended as a common platform, a data-source and experimental test-bed, for
researchers studying the application of AI and machine learning (ML) techniques to issues arising
in betting exchanges; and, as far as I have been able to determine, BBE is the first of its kind: a free
open-source agent-based simulation model consisting not only of a sports-betting exchange, but
also a minimal simulation model of racetrack sporting events (e.g., horse-races or car-races)
about which bets may be made, and a population of simulated bettors who each form their own private
evaluation of odds and place bets on the exchange before and - crucially - during the race itself (i.e.,
so-called "in-play" betting) and whose betting opinions change second-by-second as each race
event unfolds. BBE is offered as a proof-of-concept system that enables the generation of large
high-resolution data-sets for automated discovery or improvement of profitable strategies for
betting on sporting events via the application of AI/ML and advanced data analytics techniques.
This paper offers an extensive survey of relevant literature and explains the motivation and design
of BBE, and presents brief illustrative results.

Very large time series are increasingly available from an ever wider range of IoT-enabled sensors
deployed in different environments. Significant insights can be obtained through mining temporal
patterns from these time series. Unlike traditional pattern mining, temporal pattern mining (TPM)
adds additional temporal aspect into extracted patterns, thus making them more expressive. However,
adding the temporal dimension into patterns results in an exponential growth of the search space,
significantly increasing the mining process complexity. Current TPM approaches either cannot
scale to large datasets, or typically work on pre-processed event sequences rather than directly
on time series. This paper presents our comprehensive Frequent Temporal Pattern Mining from Time
Series (FTPMfTS) approach which provides the following contributions: (1) The end-to-end FTPMfTS
process that directly takes time series as input and produces frequent temporal patterns as output.
(2) The efficient Hierarchical Temporal Pattern Graph Mining (HTPGM) algorithm that uses efficient
data structures to enable fast computations for support and confidence. (3) A number of pruning
techniques for HTPGM that yield significantly faster mining. (4) An approximate version of HTPGM
which relies on mutual information to prune unpromising time series, and thus significantly reduce
the search space. (5) An extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets from the energy
and smart city domains which shows that HTPGM outperforms the baselines and can scale to large datasets.
The approximate HTPGM achieves up to 3 orders of magnitude speedup compared to the baselines and
consumes significantly less memory, while obtaining high accuracy compared to the exact HTPGM.

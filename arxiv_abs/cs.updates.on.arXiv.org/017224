Learning multimodal representations involves integrating information from multiple heterogeneous
sources of data. It is a challenging yet crucial area with numerous real-world applications in multimedia,
affective computing, robotics, finance, human-computer interaction, and healthcare. Unfortunately,
multimodal research has seen limited resources to study (1) generalization across domains and
modalities, (2) complexity during training and inference, and (3) robustness to noisy and missing
modalities. In order to accelerate progress towards understudied modalities and tasks while ensuring
real-world robustness, we release MultiBench, a systematic and unified large-scale benchmark
spanning 15 datasets, 10 modalities, 20 prediction tasks, and 6 research areas. MultiBench provides
an automated end-to-end machine learning pipeline that simplifies and standardizes data loading,
experimental setup, and model evaluation. To enable holistic evaluation, MultiBench offers a
comprehensive methodology to assess (1) generalization, (2) time and space complexity, and (3)
modality robustness. MultiBench introduces impactful challenges for future research, including
scalability to large-scale multimodal datasets and robustness to realistic imperfections. To
accompany this benchmark, we also provide a standardized implementation of 20 core approaches
in multimodal learning. Simply applying methods proposed in different research areas can improve
the state-of-the-art performance on 9/15 datasets. Therefore, MultiBench presents a milestone
in unifying disjoint efforts in multimodal research and paves the way towards a better understanding
of the capabilities and limitations of multimodal models, all the while ensuring ease of use, accessibility,
and reproducibility. MultiBench, our standardized code, and leaderboards are publicly available,
will be regularly updated, and welcomes inputs from the community.

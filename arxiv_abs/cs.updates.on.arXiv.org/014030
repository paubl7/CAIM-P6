Hamiltonian cycles in graphs were first studied in the 1850s. Since then, an impressive amount of
research has been dedicated to identifying classes of graphs that allow Hamiltonian cycles, and
to related questions. The corresponding decision problem, that asks whether a given graph is Hamiltonian
(i.\,e.\ admits a Hamiltonian cycle), is one of Karp's famous NP-complete problems. In this paper
we study graphs of bounded degree that are \emph{far} from being Hamiltonian, where a graph $G$ on
$n$ vertices is \emph{far} from being Hamiltonian, if modifying a constant fraction of $n$ edges
is necessary to make $G$ Hamiltonian. We give an explicit deterministic construction of a class
of graphs of bounded degree that are locally Hamiltonian, but (globally) far from being Hamiltonian.
Here, \emph{locally Hamiltonian} means that every subgraph induced by the neighbourhood of a small
vertex set appears in some Hamiltonian graph. More precisely, we obtain graphs which differ in $\Theta(n)$
edges from any Hamiltonian graph, but non-Hamiltonicity cannot be detected in the neighbourhood
of $o(n)$ vertices. Our class of graphs yields a class of hard instances for one-sided error property
testers with linear query complexity. It is known that any property tester (even with two-sided
error) requires a linear number of queries to test Hamiltonicity (Yoshida, Ito, 2010). This is proved
via a randomised construction of hard instances. In contrast, our construction is deterministic.
So far only very few deterministic constructions of hard instances for property testing are known.
We believe that our construction may lead to future insights in graph theory and towards a characterisation
of the properties hat are testable in the bounded-degree model.

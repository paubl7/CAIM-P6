Traditional recommender systems encounter several challenges such as data sparsity and unexplained
recommendation. To address these challenges, many works propose to exploit semantic information
from review data. However, these methods have two major limitations in terms of the way to model textual
features and capture textual interaction. For textual modeling, they simply concatenate all the
reviews of a user/item into a single review. However, feature extraction at word/phrase level can
violate the meaning of the original reviews. As for textual interaction, they defer the interactions
to the prediction layer, making them fail to capture complex correlations between users and items.
To address those limitations, we propose a novel Hierarchical Text Interaction model(HTI) for
rating prediction. In HTI, we propose to model low-level word semantics and high-level review representations
hierarchically. The hierarchy allows us to exploit textual features at different granularities.
To further capture complex user-item interactions, we propose to exploit semantic correlations
between each user-item pair at different hierarchies. At word level, we propose an attention mechanism
specialized to each user-item pair, and capture the important words for representing each review.
At review level, we mutually propagate textual features between the user and item, and capture the
informative reviews. The aggregated review representations are integrated into a collaborative
filtering framework for rating prediction. Experiments on five real-world datasets demonstrate
that HTI outperforms state-of-the-art models by a large margin. Further case studies provide a
deep insight into HTI's ability to capture semantic correlations at different levels of granularities
for rating prediction.

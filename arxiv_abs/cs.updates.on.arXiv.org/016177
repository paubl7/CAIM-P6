Over the years, population protocols with the goal of reaching consensus have been studied in great
depth. However, many systems in the real-world do not result in all agents eventually reaching consensus,
but rather in the opposite: they converge to a state of rich diversity. Consider for example task
allocation in ants. If eventually all ants perform the same task, then the colony will perish (lack
of food, no brood care, etc.). Then, it is vital for the survival of the colony to have a diverse set
of tasks and enough ants working on each task. What complicates matters is that ants need to switch
tasks periodically to adjust the needs of the colony; e.g., when too many foragers fell victim to
other ant colonies. Moreover, all tasks are equally important and maybe they need to keep certain
proportions in the distribution of the task. How can ants keep a healthy and balanced allocation
of tasks? To answer this question, we propose a simple population protocol for $n$ agents on a complete
graph and an arbitrary initial distribution of $k$ colours (tasks). We assume that each colour $i$
has an associated weight (importance) $w_i \geq 1$. By denoting $w$ as the sum of the weights of different
colours, we show that the protocol converges in $O(w^2 n \log n)$ rounds to a configuration where
the number of agents supporting each colour $i$ is concentrated on the fair share $w_in/w$ and will
stay concentrated for a large number of rounds, w.h.p. Our protocol has many interesting properties:
agents do not need to know other colours and weights in the system, and our protocol requires very
little memory per agent. Furthermore, the protocol guarantees fairness meaning that over a long
period each agent has each colour roughly a number of times proportional to the weight of the colour.
Finally, our protocol also fulfils sustainability meaning that no colour ever vanishes.

Accurate forecasting of passenger flow (i.e., ridership) is critical to the operation of urban
metro systems. Previous studies mainly model passenger flow as time series by aggregating individual
trips and then perform forecasting based on the values in the past several steps. However, this approach
essentially overlooks the fact that passenger flow consists of trips from each individual traveler.
For example, a traveler's work trip in the morning can help predict his/her home trip in the evening,
while this causal structure cannot be explicitly encoded in standard time series models. In this
paper, we propose a new forecasting framework for boarding flow by incorporating the generative
mechanism into standard time series models and leveraging the strong regularity rooted in travel
behavior. In doing so, we introduce returning flow from previous alighting trips as a new covariate,
which captures the causal structure and long-range dependencies in passenger flow data based on
travel behavior. We develop the return probability parallelogram (RPP) to summarize the causal
relationships and estimate the return flow. The proposed framework is evaluated using real-world
passenger flow data, and the results confirm that the returning flow -- a single covariate -- can
substantially and consistently improve various forecasting tasks, including one-step ahead
forecasting, multi-step ahead forecasting, and forecasting under special events. And the proposed
method is more effective for business-type stations with most passengers come and return within
the same day. This study can be extended to other modes of transport, and it also sheds new light on
general demand time series forecasting problems, in which causal structure and long-range dependencies
are generated by the user behavior.

Electric grids are traditionally operated as multi-entity systems with each entity managing a
geographical region. Interest and demand for decarbonization and energy democratization is resulting
in growing penetration of controllable energy resources. In turn, this process is increasing the
number of grid entities. The paradigm shift is also fueled by increased adoption of intelligent
sensors and actuators equipped with advanced processing and computing capabilities. While collaboration
among power grid entities (agents) reduces energy cost and increases overall reliability, achieving
effective collaboration is challenging. The main challenges stem from the heterogeneity of system
agents and their collected information. Furthermore, the scale of data collection is constantly
increasing and many grid entities have strict privacy requirements. Another challenge is the energy
industry's common practice of keeping data in silos. Federated computation is an approach well
suited to addressing these issues that are increasingly important for multi-agent energy systems.
Through federated computation, agents collaboratively solve learning and optimization problems
while respecting each agent's privacy and overcoming barriers of cross-device and cross-organization
data isolation. In this paper, we first establish the need for federated computations to achieve
energy optimization goals of the future power grid. We discuss practical challenges of performing
multi-agent data processing in general. Then we address challenges that arise specifically for
orchestrating operation of connected distributed energy resources in the Internet of Things.
We conclude this paper by presenting a novel federated computation framework that addresses some
of these issues, and we share examples of two initial field test setups in research demonstrations
and commercial building applications with Grid Fruit LLC.

Context: Contemporary software development is typically conducted in dynamic, resource-scarce
environments that are prone to the accumulation of technical debt. While this general phenomenon
is acknowledged, what remains unknown is how technical debt specifically manifests in and affects
software processes, and how the software development techniques employed accommodate or mitigate
the presence of this debt. Objectives: We sought to draw on practitioner insights and experiences
in order to classify the effects of agile method use on technical debt management. We explore the
breadth of practitioners' knowledge about technical debt; how technical debt is manifested across
the software process; and the perceived effects of common agile software development practices
and processes on technical debt. In doing so, we address a research gap in technical debt knowledge
and provide novel and actionable managerial recommendations. Method: We designed, tested and
executed a multi-national survey questionnaire to address our objectives, receiving 184 responses
from practitioners in Brazil, Finland, and New Zealand. Results: Our findings indicate that: 1)
Practitioners are aware of technical debt, although, there was under utilization of the concept,
2) Technical debt commonly resides in legacy systems, however, concrete instances of technical
debt are hard to conceptualize which makes it problematic to manage, 3) Queried agile practices
and processes help to reduce technical debt; particularly, techniques that verify and maintain
the structure and clarity of implemented artifacts. Conclusions: The fact that technical debt
instances tend to have characteristics in common means that a systematic approach to its management
is feasible. However, notwithstanding the positive effects of some agile practices on technical
debt management, competing stakeholders' interests remain a concern.(Abridged)

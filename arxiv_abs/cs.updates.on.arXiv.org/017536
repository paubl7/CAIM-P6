Click-through rate prediction is one of the core tasks in commercial recommender systems. It aims
to predict the probability of a user clicking a particular item given user and item features. As feature
interactions bring in non-linearity, they are widely adopted to improve the performance of CTR
prediction models. Therefore, effectively modelling feature interactions has attracted much
attention in both the research and industry field. The current approaches can generally be categorized
into three classes: (1) na\"ive methods, which do not model feature interactions and only use original
features; (2) memorized methods, which memorize feature interactions by explicitly viewing them
as new features and assigning trainable embeddings; (3) factorized methods, which learn latent
vectors for original features and implicitly model feature interactions through factorization
functions. Studies have shown that modelling feature interactions by one of these methods alone
are suboptimal due to the unique characteristics of different feature interactions. To address
this issue, we first propose a general framework called OptInter which finds the most suitable modelling
method for each feature interaction. Different state-of-the-art deep CTR models can be viewed
as instances of OptInter. To realize the functionality of OptInter, we also introduce a learning
algorithm that automatically searches for the optimal modelling method. We conduct extensive
experiments on four large datasets. Our experiments show that OptInter improves the best performed
state-of-the-art baseline deep CTR models by up to 2.21%. Compared to the memorized method, which
also outperforms baselines, we reduce up to 91% parameters. In addition, we conduct several ablation
studies to investigate the influence of different components of OptInter. Finally, we provide
interpretable discussions on the results of OptInter.

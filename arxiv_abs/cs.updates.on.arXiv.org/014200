Meditation practices have been claimed to have a positive effect on the regulation of mood and emotion
for quite some time by practitioners, and in recent times there has been a sustained effort to provide
a more precise description of the changes induced by meditation on human brain. Longitudinal studies
have reported morphological changes in cortical thickness and volume in selected brain regions
due to meditation practice, which is interpreted as evidence for effectiveness of it beyond the
subjective self reporting. Evidence based on real time monitoring of meditating brain by functional
imaging modalities such as MEG or EEG remains a challenge. In this article we consider MEG data collected
during meditation sessions of experienced Buddhist monks practicing focused attention (Samatha)
and open monitoring (Vipassana) meditation, contrasted by resting state with eyes closed. The
MEG data is first mapped to time series of brain activity averaged over brain regions corresponding
to a standard Destrieux brain atlas, and further by bootstrapping and spectral analysis to data
matrices representing a random sample of power spectral densities over bandwidths corresponding
to $\alpha$, $\beta$, $\gamma$, and $\theta$ bands in the spectral range. We demonstrate using
linear discriminant analysis (LDA) that the samples corresponding to different meditative or
resting states contain enough fingerprints of the brain state to allow a separation between different
states, and we identify the brain regions that appear to contribute to the separation. Our findings
suggest that cingulate cortex, insular cortex and some of the internal structures, most notably
accumbens, caudate and putamen nuclei, thalamus and amygdalae stand out as separating regions,
which seems to correlate well with earlier findings based on longitudinal studies.

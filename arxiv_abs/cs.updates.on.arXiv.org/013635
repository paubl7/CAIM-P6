Artificial intelligence (AI) in phishing email detection typically focuses on centralized data
training that eventually accesses sensitive raw email data from the collected data repository.
Due to privacy, organizations are reluctant to share their email data, and it is uncommon to find
enough data in one organization to forming a global AI model. Thus, a privacy-friendly AI technique
such as federated learning (FL) is a desideratum. FL enables machine learning over multi-organizational
email datasets to preserve their privacy without the requirement of accessing them and sharing
with other organizations during the learning in a distributed computing framework. To the best
of our knowledge, this work is the first to investigate FL in email anti-phishing. Building upon
a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network for phishing email detection, we analyze and evaluate
FL-entangled learning performance under various settings, including (i) balanced and imbalanced
data distribution among organizations, (ii) scalability, and (iii) communication overhead.
Our results positively corroborate comparable performance statistics of FL in phishing email
detection to centralized learning. As a trade-off to privacy and distributed learning, FL has a
communication overhead of 0.179 GB per global epoch per its organizations, and a gradual degradation
in performance if we increase the number of organizations but keep the same total email dataset.
However, if we allow to increase the total email dataset with the introduction of new organizations
in the FL framework, the organization-level performance is improved. For example, a newly added
organization in FL makes an improvement in testing accuracy by 1.87% and fast convergence compared
to centralized learning. Besides, our empirical results find that FL has a good performance over
imbalanced email dataset.

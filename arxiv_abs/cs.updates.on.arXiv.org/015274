Multi-agent systems are designed to concurrently accomplish a diverse set of tasks at unprecedented
scale. Here, the central problems faced by a system operator are to decide (i) how to divide available
resources amongst the agents assigned to tasks and (ii) how to coordinate the behavior of the agents
to optimize the efficiency of the resulting collective behavior. The focus of this paper is on problem
(i), where we seek to characterize the impact of the division of resources on the best-case efficiency
of the resulting collective behavior. Specifically, we focus on a team Colonel Blotto game where
there are two sub-colonels competing against a common adversary in a two battlefield environment.
Here, each sub-colonel is assigned a given resource budget and is required to allocate these resources
independent of the other sub-colonel. However, their success is dependent on the allocation strategy
of both sub-colonels. The central focus of this manuscript is on how to divide a common pool of resources
among the two sub-colonels to optimize the resulting best-case efficiency guarantees. Intuitively,
one would imagine that the more balanced the division of resources, the worse the performance, as
such divisions restrict the sub-colonels' ability to employ joint randomized strategies that
tend to be necessary for optimizing performance guarantees. However, the main result of this paper
demonstrates that this intuition is actually incorrect. A more balanced division of resources
can offer better performance guarantees than a more centralized division. Hence, this paper demonstrates
that the resource division problem is highly non-trivial in such enmeshed environments and worthy
of significant future research efforts.

Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs) are characterized within randomized clinical trials and postmarketing
pharmacovigilance, but their molecular mechanism remains unknown in most cases. Aside from clinical
trials, many elements of knowledge about drug ingredients are available in open-access knowledge
graphs. In addition, drug classifications that label drugs as either causative or not for several
ADRs, have been established. We propose to mine knowledge graphs for identifying biomolecular
features that may enable reproducing automatically expert classifications that distinguish
drug causative or not for a given type of ADR. In an explainable AI perspective, we explore simple
classification techniques such as Decision Trees and Classification Rules because they provide
human-readable models, which explain the classification itself, but may also provide elements
of explanation for molecular mechanisms behind ADRs. In summary, we mine a knowledge graph for features;
we train classifiers at distinguishing, drugs associated or not with ADRs; we isolate features
that are both efficient in reproducing expert classifications and interpretable by experts (i.e.,
Gene Ontology terms, drug targets, or pathway names); and we manually evaluate how they may be explanatory.
Extracted features reproduce with a good fidelity classifications of drugs causative or not for
DILI and SCAR. Experts fully agreed that 73% and 38% of the most discriminative features are possibly
explanatory for DILI and SCAR, respectively; and partially agreed (2/3) for 90% and 77% of them.
Knowledge graphs provide diverse features to enable simple and explainable models to distinguish
between drugs that are causative or not for ADRs. In addition to explaining classifications, most
discriminative features appear to be good candidates for investigating ADR mechanisms further.

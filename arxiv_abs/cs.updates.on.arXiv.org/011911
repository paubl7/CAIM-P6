Black-box Artificial Intelligence (AI) methods, e.g. deep neural networks, have been widely utilized
to build predictive models that can extract complex relationships in a dataset and make predictions
for new unseen data records. However, it is difficult to trust decisions made by such methods since
their inner working and decision logic is hidden from the user. Explainable Artificial Intelligence
(XAI) refers to systems that try to explain how a black-box AI model produces its outcomes. Post-hoc
XAI methods approximate the behavior of a black-box by extracting relationships between feature
values and the predictions. Perturbation-based and decision set methods are among commonly used
post-hoc XAI systems. The former explanators rely on random perturbations of data records to build
local or global linear models that explain individual predictions or the whole model. The latter
explanators use those feature values that appear more frequently to construct a set of decision
rules that produces the same outcomes as the target black-box. However, these two classes of XAI
methods have some limitations. Random perturbations do not take into account the distribution
of feature values in different subspaces, leading to misleading approximations. Decision sets
only pay attention to frequent feature values and miss many important correlations between features
and class labels that appear less frequently but accurately represent decision boundaries of the
model. In this paper, we address the above challenges by proposing an explanation method named Confident
Itemsets Explanation (CIE). We introduce confident itemsets, a set of feature values that are highly
correlated to a specific class label. CIE utilizes confident itemsets to discretize the whole decision
space of a model to smaller subspaces.

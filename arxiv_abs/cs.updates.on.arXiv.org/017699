We present a novel communication-free algorithm for individual-based probabilistic neutral
biodiversity simulations. The algorithm transforms a neutral Moran ecosystem model into an embarrassingly
parallel problem by trading off inter-process communication at the cost of some redundant computation.
Specifically, by careful design of the random number generator that drives the simulation, we arrange
for evolutionary parent-child interactions to be modelled without requiring knowledge of the
interaction, its participants, or which processor is performing the computation. Critically,
this means that every individual can be simulated entirely independently. The simulation is thus
fully reproducible irrespective of the number of processors it is distributed over. With our novel
algorithm, a simulation can be (1) split up into independent batch jobs and (2) simulated across
any number of heterogeneous machines - all without affecting the simulation result. We use the Rust
programming language to build the extensible and statically checked simulation package $\texttt{necsim-rust}$.
We evaluate our parallelisation approach by comparing three traditional simulation algorithms
against a CPU and GPU implementation of our Independent algorithm. These experiments show that
as long as some local state is maintained to cull redundant individuals, our Independent algorithm
is as efficient as existing sequential solutions. The GPU implementation further outperforms
all algorithms on the CPU by a factor ranging from $\sim 2$ to $\sim 80$, depending on the model parameterisation
and the analysis that is performed. Amongst the parallel algorithms we have investigated, our Independent
algorithm provides the only non-approximate parallelisation strategy that can scale to large
simulation domains.

Among many prevailing malware, crypto-ransomware poses a significant threat as it financially
extorts affected users by creating denial of access via unauthorized encryption of their documents
as well as holding their documents hostage and financially extorting them. This results in millions
of dollars of annual losses worldwide. Multiple variants of ransomware are growing in number with
capabilities of evasion from many anti-viruses and software-only malware detection schemes that
rely on static execution signatures. In this paper, we propose a hardware-assisted scheme, called
RanStop, for early detection of crypto-ransomware infection in commodity processors. RanStop
leverages the information of hardware performance counters embedded in the performance monitoring
unit in modern processors to observe micro-architectural event sets and detects known and unknown
crypto-ransomware variants. In this paper, we train a recurrent neural network-based machine
learning architecture using long short-term memory (LSTM) model for analyzing micro-architectural
events in the hardware domain when executing multiple variants of ransomware as well as benign programs.
We create timeseries to develop intrinsic statistical features using the information of related
HPCs and improve the detection accuracy of RanStop and reduce noise by via LSTM and global average
pooling. As an early detection scheme, RanStop can accurately and quickly identify ransomware
within 2ms from the start of the program execution by analyzing HPC information collected for 20
timestamps each 100us apart. This detection time is too early for a ransomware to make any significant
damage, if none. Moreover, validation against benign programs with behavioral (sub-routine-centric)
similarity with that of a crypto-ransomware shows that RanStop can detect ransomware with an average
of 97% accuracy for fifty random trials.

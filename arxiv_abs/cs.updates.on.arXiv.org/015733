In this paper we consider the problem of testing whether a graph has bounded arboricity. The family
of graphs with bounded arboricity includes, among others, bounded-degree graphs, all minor-closed
graph classes (e.g. planar graphs, graphs with bounded treewidth) and randomly generated preferential
attachment graphs. Graphs with bounded arboricity have been studied extensively in the past, in
particular since for many problems they allow for much more efficient algorithms and/or better
approximation ratios. We present a tolerant tester in the sparse-graphs model. The sparse-graphs
model allows access to degree queries and neighbor queries, and the distance is defined with respect
to the actual number of edges. More specifically, our algorithm distinguishes between graphs that
are $\epsilon$-close to having arboricity $\alpha$ and graphs that $c \cdot \epsilon$-far from
having arboricity $3\alpha$, where $c$ is an absolute small constant. The query complexity and
running time of the algorithm are $\tilde{O}\left(\frac{n}{\sqrt{m}}\cdot \frac{\log(1/\epsilon)}{\epsilon}
+ \frac{n\cdot \alpha}{m} \cdot \left(\frac{1}{\epsilon}\right)^{O(\log(1/\epsilon))}\right)$
where $n$ denotes the number of vertices and $m$ denotes the number of edges. In terms of the dependence
on $n$ and $m$ this bound is optimal up to poly-logarithmic factors since $\Omega(n/\sqrt{m})$
queries are necessary (and $\alpha = O(\sqrt{m}))$. We leave it as an open question whether the dependence
on $1/\epsilon$ can be improved from quasi-polynomial to polynomial. Our techniques include an
efficient local simulation for approximating the outcome of a global (almost) forest-decomposition
algorithm as well as a tailored procedure of edge sampling.

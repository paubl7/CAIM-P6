Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the main cause of deaths all over the world. Heart murmurs are
the most common abnormalities detected during the auscultation process. The two widely used publicly
available phonocardiogram (PCG) datasets are from the PhysioNet/CinC (2016) and PASCAL (2011)
challenges. The datasets are significantly different in terms of the tools used for data acquisition,
clinical protocols, digital storages and signal qualities, making it challenging to process and
analyze. In this work, we have used short-time Fourier transform (STFT) based spectrograms to learn
the representative patterns of the normal and abnormal PCG signals. Spectrograms generated from
both the datasets are utilized to perform three different studies: (i) train, validate and test
different variants of convolutional neural network (CNN) models with PhysioNet dataset, (ii)
train, validate and test the best performing CNN structure on combined PhysioNet-PASCAL dataset
and (iii) finally, transfer learning technique is employed to train the best performing pre-trained
network from the first study with PASCAL dataset. We propose a novel, less complex and relatively
light custom CNN model for the classification of PhysioNet, combined and PASCAL datasets. The first
study achieves an accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, precision and F1 score of 95.4%, 96.3%,
92.4%, 97.6% and 96.98% respectively while the second study shows accuracy, sensitivity, specificity,
precision and F1 score of 94.2%, 95.5%, 90.3%, 96.8% and 96.1% respectively. Finally, the third
study shows a precision of 98.29% on the noisy PASCAL dataset with transfer learning approach. All
the three proposed approaches outperform most of the recent competing studies by achieving comparatively
high classification accuracy and precision, which make them suitable for screening CVDs using
PCG signals.

TikTok is a music-based video sharing social media app famous for users creating short meme and dance
videos. TikTok videos are largely based on popular song snippets, which is why lip syncing and dance
moves evolve as significant user performance practices in videos. User prosumption has not yet
been studied regarding the characteristics of TikTok. This paper is based on social practice and
performance theory, social media studies, and participatory online video culture. It uses the
#distantdance challenge on TikTok to analyze production practices and strategies of users through
qualitative video product analysis. 92 videos were coded and categorized regarding their visual
content (who participated in which way) and paratextual elements (used tags and captions). The
visual and (para-)textual elements were then analyzed regarding indicators that allow to draw
conclusions on users' video creation strategies and performance practices in participating in
the #distantdance challenge. The results show videos are mainly performed by single white female
teenagers wearing casual outfits in their bedrooms. Users shared their experiences about learning
and performing the dance in video captions. While users prepared settings and outfits for their
performance, the majority of performances seems rather unplanned or spontaneous. This indicates
most videos might be part of a series of user attempts to master the dance challenge resulting in posting
the first successful video performance to TikTok. In addition to the dance moves, participants
also added gestures as closing elements to their performances. This indicates their knowledge
of using signals as part of an online community while at the same time manifesting their belongingness
to the community. These first results of a qualitative product analysis illustrate some of users'
motivations and effort to participate in TikTok dance challenges.

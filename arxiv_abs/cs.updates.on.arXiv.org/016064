Sustainable roofs, such as those with greenery and photovoltaic panels, contribute to the roadmap
for reducing the carbon footprint of cities. However, research on sustainable urban roofscapes
is rather focused on their potential and it is hindered by the scarcity of data, limiting our understanding
of their current content, spatial distribution, and temporal evolution. To tackle this issue,
we introduce Roofpedia, a set of three contributions: (i) automatic mapping of relevant urban roof
typology from satellite imagery; (ii) an open roof registry mapping the spatial distribution and
area of solar and green roofs of more than one million buildings across 17 cities; and (iii) the Roofpedia
Index, a derivative of the registry, to benchmark the cities by the extent of sustainable roofscape
in term of solar and green roof penetration. This project, partly inspired by its street greenery
counterpart `Treepedia', is made possible by a multi-step pipeline that combines deep learning
and geospatial techniques, demonstrating the feasibility of an automated methodology that generalises
successfully across cities with an accuracy of detecting sustainable roofs of up to 100% in some
cities. We offer our results as an interactive map and open dataset so that our work could aid researchers,
local governments, and the public to uncover the pattern of sustainable rooftops across cities,
track and monitor the current use of rooftops, complement studies on their potential, evaluate
the effectiveness of existing incentives, verify the use of subsidies and fulfilment of climate
pledges, estimate carbon offset capacities of cities, and ultimately support better policies
and strategies to increase the adoption of instruments contributing to the sustainable development
of cities.

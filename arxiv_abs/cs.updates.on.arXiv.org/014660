Generalization beyond a training dataset is a main goal of machine learning, but theoretical understanding
of generalization remains an open problem for many models. The need for a new theory is exacerbated
by recent observations in deep neural networks where overparameterization leads to better performance,
contradicting the conventional wisdom from classical statistics. In this paper, we investigate
generalization error for kernel regression, which, besides being a popular machine learning method,
also includes infinitely overparameterized neural networks trained with gradient descent. We
use techniques from statistical mechanics to derive an analytical expression for generalization
error applicable to any kernel or data distribution. We present applications of our theory to real
and synthetic datasets, and for many kernels including those that arise from training deep neural
networks in the infinite-width limit. We elucidate an inductive bias of kernel regression to explain
data with "simple functions", which are identified by solving a kernel eigenfunction problem on
the data distribution. This notion of simplicity allows us to characterize whether a kernel is compatible
with a learning task, facilitating good generalization performance from a small number of training
examples. We show that more data may impair generalization when noisy or not expressible by the kernel,
leading to non-monotonic learning curves with possibly many peaks. To further understand these
phenomena, we turn to the broad class of rotation invariant kernels, which is relevant to training
deep neural networks in the infinite-width limit, and present a detailed mathematical analysis
of them when data is drawn from a spherically symmetric distribution and the number of input dimensions
is large.

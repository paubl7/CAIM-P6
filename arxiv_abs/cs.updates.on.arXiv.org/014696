The thermal radiative transfer (TRT) equations form a system that describes the propagation and
collisional interactions of photons. Computing accurate and efficient numerical solutions to
TRT is challenging for several reasons, the first of which is that TRT is defined on a high-dimensional
phase space. In order to reduce the dimensionality, classical approaches such as the P$_N$ (spherical
harmonics) or the S$_N$ (discrete ordinates) ansatz are often used in the literature. In this work,
we introduce a novel approach: the hybrid discrete (H$^T_N$) approximation. This approach acquires
desirable properties of both P$_N$ and S$_N$, and indeed reduces to each of these approximations
in various limits. We prove that H$^T_N$ results in a system of hyperbolic equations. Another challenge
in solving the TRT system is the inherent stiffness due to the large timescale separation between
propagation and collisions. This can be partially overcome via implicit time integration, although
fully implicit methods may become expensive due to the strong nonlinearity and system size. On the
other hand, explicit time-stepping schemes that are not also asymptotic-preserving in the highly
collisional limit require resolving the mean-free path between collisions. We develop a method
that is based on a discontinuous Galerkin scheme in space, coupled with a semi-implicit scheme in
time. In particular, we make use of an explicit Runge-Kutta scheme for the streaming term and an implicit
Euler scheme for the material coupling term. Furthermore, in order to solve the material energy
equation implicitly after each step, we linearize the temperature term; this avoids the need for
an iterative procedure. In order to reduce unphysical oscillation, we apply a slope limiter after
each time step. Finally, we conduct several numerical experiments to verify the accuracy, efficiency,
and robustness of the method.

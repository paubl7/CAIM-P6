In the last decade, political debates have progressively shifted to social media. Rhetorical devices
employed by online actors and factions that operate in these debating arenas can be captured and
analysed to conduct a statistical reading of societal controversies and their argumentation dynamics.
In this paper, we propose a five-step methodology, to extract, categorize and explore the latent
argumentation structures of online debates. Using Twitter data about a "no-deal" Brexit, we focus
on the expected effects in case of materialisation of this event. First, we extract cause-effect
claims contained in tweets using RegEx that exploit verbs related to Creation, Destruction and
Causation. Second, we categorise extracted "no-deal" effects using a Structural Topic Model estimated
on unigrams and bigrams. Third, we select controversial effect topics and explore within-topic
argumentation differences between self-declared partisan user factions. We hence type topics
using estimated covariate effects on topic propensities, then, using the topics correlation network,
we study the topological structure of the debate to identify coherent topical constellations.
Finally, we analyse the debate time dynamics and infer lead/follow relations among factions. Results
show that the proposed methodology can be employed to perform a statistical rhetorics analysis
of debates, and map the architecture of controversies across time. In particular, the "no-deal"
Brexit debate is shown to have an assortative argumentation structure heavily characterized by
factional constellations of arguments, as well as by polarized narrative frames invoked through
verbs related to Creation and Destruction. Our findings highlight the benefits of implementing
a systemic approach to the analysis of debates, which allows the unveiling of topical and factional
dependencies between arguments employed in online debates.

The problem of selecting optimal valid backdoor adjustment sets to estimate causal effects in graphical
models with hidden and conditioned variables is addressed. Previous work has defined optimality
as achieving the smallest asymptotic variance compared to other adjustment sets and identified
a graphical criterion for an optimal set for the case without hidden variables. For the case with
hidden variables currently a sufficient graphical criterion and a corresponding construction
algorithm exists. Here optimality is characterized by an information-theoretic approach based
on the conditional mutual informations among cause, effect, adjustment set, and conditioned variables.
This characterization allows to derive the main contributions of this paper: A necessary and sufficient
graphical criterion for the existence of an optimal adjustment set and a definition and algorithm
to construct it. Further, the optimal set is valid if and only if a valid adjustment set exists and
has smaller (or equal) asymptotic variance compared to the Adjust-set proposed in Perkovic et al.
(2018) (arXiv:1606.06903) for any graph, whether graphical optimality holds or not. The results
are valid for a class of estimators whose asymptotic variance follows a certain information-theoretic
relation. Numerical experiments indicate that the asymptotic results also hold for relatively
small sample sizes. For estimators outside of the class studied here none of the considered adjustment
sets outperforms all others, but a minimized variant of the optimal set proposed here tends to have
lower variance. Surprisingly, among the randomly created setups more than 80\% fulfill the optimality
conditions indicating that also in many real-world scenarios graphical optimality may hold. Code

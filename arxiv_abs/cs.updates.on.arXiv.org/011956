How do rational agents self-organize when trying to connect to a common target? We study this question
with a simple tree formation game which is related to the well-known fair single-source connection
game by Anshelevich et al. (FOCS'04) and selfish spanning tree games by Gourv\`es and Monnot (WINE'08).
In our game agents correspond to nodes in a network that activate a single outgoing edge to connect
to the common target node (possibly via other nodes). Agents pay for their path to the common target,
and edge costs are shared fairly among all agents using an edge. The main novelty of our model is dynamic
edge costs that depend on the in-degree of the respective endpoint. This reflects that connecting
to popular nodes that have increased internal coordination costs is more expensive since they can
charge higher prices for their routing service. In contrast to related models, we show that equilibria
are not guaranteed to exist, but we prove the existence for infinitely many numbers of agents. Moreover,
we analyze the structure of equilibrium trees and employ these insights to prove a constant upper
bound on the Price of Anarchy as well as non-trivial lower bounds on both the Price of Anarchy and the
Price of Stability. We also show that in comparison with the social optimum tree the overall cost
of an equilibrium tree is more fairly shared among the agents. Thus, we prove that self-organization
of rational agents yields on average only slightly higher cost per agent compared to the centralized
optimum, and at the same time, it induces a more fair cost distribution. Moreover, equilibrium trees
achieve a beneficial trade-off between a low height and low maximum degree, and hence these trees
might be of independent interest from a combinatorics point-of-view. We conclude with a discussion
of promising extensions of our model.

In modular robotics, modules can be reconfigured to change the morphology of the robot, making it
able to adapt for specific tasks. However, optimizing both the body and control is a difficult challenge
due to the intricate relationship between fine-tuning control and morphological changes that
can invalidate such optimizations. To solve this challenge we compare three different Evolutionary
Algorithms on their capacity to optimize morphologies in modular robotics. We compare two objective-based
search algorithms, with MAP-Elites. To understand the benefit of diversity we transition the evolved
populations into two difficult environments to see if diversity can have an impact on solving complex
environments. In addition, we analyse the genealogical ancestry to shed light on the notion of stepping
stones as key to enable high performance. The results show that MAP-Elites is capable of evolving
the highest performing solutions in addition to generating the largest morphological diversity.
For the transition between environments the results show that MAP-Elites is better at regaining
performance by promoting morphological diversity. With the analysis of genealogical ancestry
we show that MAP-Elites produces more diverse and higher performing stepping stones than the other
objective-based search algorithms. Transitioning the populations to more difficult environments
show the utility of morphological diversity, while the analysis of stepping stones show a strong
correlation between diversity of ancestry and maximum performance on the locomotion task. The
paper shows the advantage of promoting diversity for solving a locomotion task in different environments
for modular robotics. By showing that the quality and diversity of stepping stones in Evolutionary
Algorithms is an important factor for overall performance we have opened up a new area of analysis
and results.

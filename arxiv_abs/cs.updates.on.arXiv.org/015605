An optical circuit-switched network core has the potential to overcome the inherent challenges
of a conventional electrical packet-switched core of today's compute clusters. As optical circuit
switches (OCS) directly handle the photon beams without any optical-electrical-optical (O/E/O)
conversion and packet processing, OCS-based network cores have the following desirable properties:
a) agnostic to data-rate, b) negligible/zero power consumption, c) no need of transceivers, d)
negligible forwarding latency, and e) no need for frequent upgrade. Unfortunately, OCS can only
provide point-to-point (unicast) circuits. They do not have built-in support for one-to-many
(multicast) communication, yet multicast is fundamental to a plethora of data-intensive applications
running on compute clusters nowadays. In this paper, we propose Shufflecast, a novel optical network
architecture for next-generation compute clusters that can support high-performance multicast
satisfying all the properties of an OCS-based network core. Shufflecast leverages small fanout,
inexpensive, passive optical splitters to connect the Top-of-rack (ToR) switch ports, ensuring
data-rate agnostic, low-power, physical-layer multicast. We thoroughly analyze Shufflecast's
highly scalable data plane, light-weight control plane, and graceful failure handling. Further,
we implement a complete prototype of Shufflecast in our testbed and extensively evaluate the network.
Shufflecast is more power-efficient than the state-of-the-art multicast mechanisms. Also, Shufflecast
is more cost-efficient than a conventional packet-switched network. By adding Shufflecast alongside
an OCS-based unicast network, an all-optical network core with the aforementioned desirable properties
supporting both unicast and multicast can be realized.

A decent number of lower bounds for non-elitist population-based evolutionary algorithms has
been shown by now. Most of them are technically demanding due to the (hard to avoid) use of negative
drift theorems -- general results which translate an expected progress away from the target into
a high hitting time. We propose a simple negative drift theorem for multiplicative drift scenarios
and show that it can simplify existing analyses. We discuss in more detail Lehre's (PPSN 2010) \emph{negative
drift in populations} method, one of the most general tools to prove lower bounds on the runtime of
non-elitist mutation-based evolutionary algorithms for discrete search spaces. Together with
other arguments, we obtain an alternative and simpler proof, which also strengthens and simplifies
this method. In particular, now only three of the five technical conditions of the previous result
have to be verified. The lower bounds we obtain are explicit instead of only asymptotic. This allows
to compute concrete lower bounds for concrete algorithms, but also enables us to show that super-polynomial
runtimes appear already when the reproduction rate is only a $(1 - \omega(n^{-1/2}))$ factor below
the threshold. For the special case of algorithms using standard bit mutation with a random mutation
rate (called uniform mixing in the language of hyper-heuristics), we prove the result stated by
Dang and Lehre (PPSN 2016) and extend it to mutation rates other than $\Theta(1/n)$, which includes
the heavy-tailed mutation operator proposed by Doerr, Le, Makhmara, and Nguyen (GECCO 2017). We
finally apply our method and a novel domination argument to show an exponential lower bound for the
runtime of the mutation-only simple genetic algorithm on \onemax for arbitrary population size.

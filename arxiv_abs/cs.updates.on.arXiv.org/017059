The subgraph-centric programming model is a promising approach and has been applied in many state-of-the-art
distributed graph computing frameworks. However, traditional graph partition algorithms have
significant difficulties in processing large-scale power-law graphs. The major problem is the
communication bottleneck found in many subgraph-centric frameworks. Detailed analysis indicates
that the communication bottleneck is caused by the huge communication volume or the extreme message
imbalance among partitioned subgraphs. The traditional partition algorithms do not consider
both factors at the same time, especially on power-law graphs. In this paper, we propose a novel efficient
and balanced vertex-cut graph partition algorithm (EBV) which grants appropriate weights to the
overall communication cost and communication balance. We observe that the number of replicated
vertices and the balance of edge and vertex assignment have a great influence on communication patterns
of distributed subgraph-centric frameworks, which further affect the overall performance. Based
on this insight, We design an evaluation function that quantifies the proportion of replicated
vertices and the balance of edges and vertices assignments as important parameters. Besides, we
sort the order of edge processing by the sum of end-vertices' degrees from small to large. Experiments
show that EBV reduces replication factor and communication by at least 21.8% and 23.7% respectively
than other self-based partition algorithms. When deployed in the subgraph-centric framework,
it reduces the running time on power-law graphs by an average of 16.8% compared with the state-of-the-art
partition algorithm. Our results indicate that EBV has a great potential in improving the performance
of subgraph-centric frameworks for the parallel large-scale power-law graph processing.

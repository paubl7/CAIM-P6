The multiplayer promise set disjointness is one of the most widely used problems from communication
complexity in applications. In this problem there are $k$ players with subsets $S^1, \ldots, S^k$,
each drawn from $\{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$, and we are promised that either the sets are (1) pairwise disjoint,
or (2) there is a unique element $j$ occurring in all the sets, which are otherwise pairwise disjoint.
The total communication of solving this problem with constant probability in the blackboard model
is $\Omega(n/k)$. We observe for most applications, it instead suffices to look at what we call the
``mostly'' set disjointness problem, which changes case (2) to say there is a unique element $j$
occurring in at least half of the sets, and the sets are otherwise disjoint. This change gives us a
much simpler proof of an $\Omega(n/k)$ randomized total communication lower bound, avoiding Hellinger
distance and Poincare inequalities. Using this we show several new results for data streams: \begin{itemize}
\item for $\ell_2$-Heavy Hitters, any $O(1)$-pass streaming algorithm in the insertion-only
model for detecting if an $\eps$-$\ell_2$-heavy hitter exists requires $\min(\frac{1}{\eps^2}\log
\frac{\eps^2n}{\delta}, \frac{1}{\eps}n^{1/2})$ bits of memory, which is optimal up to a $\log
n$ factor. For deterministic algorithms and constant $\eps$, this gives an $\Omega(n^{1/2})$
lower bound, improving the prior $\Omega(\log n)$ lower bound. We also obtain lower bounds for Zipfian
distributions. \item for $\ell_p$-Estimation, $p > 2$, we show an $O(1)$-pass $\Omega(n^{1-2/p}
\log(1/\delta))$ bit lower bound for outputting an $O(1)$-approximation with probability $1-\delta$,
in the insertion-only model. This is optimal, and the best previous lower bound was $\Omega(n^{1-2/p}
+ \log(1/\delta))$. \end{itemize}

Coronaviruses constitute a family of viruses that gives rise to respiratory diseases. COVID-19
is an infectious disease caused by a newly discovered coronavirus also termed Severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). As COVID-19 is highly contagious, early diagnosis of COVID-19
is crucial for an effective treatment strategy. However, the reverse transcription-polymerase
chain reaction (RT-PCR) test which is considered to be a gold standard in the diagnosis of COVID-19
suffers from a high false-negative rate. Therefore, the research community is exploring alternative
diagnostic mechanisms. Chest X-ray (CXR) image analysis has emerged as a feasible and effective
diagnostic technique towards this objective. In this work, we propose the COVID-19 classification
problem as a three-class classification problem namely COVID-19, normal, and pneumonia. We propose
a three-stage framework, named COV-ELM based on extreme learning machine (ELM). Our dataset comprises
CXR images in a frontal view, namely Poster anterior (PA) and Erect anteroposterior (AP). Stage
one deals with preprocessing and transformation, stage 2 deals with the challenge of extracting
relevant features which are passed as input to the ELM at the third stage, resulting in the identification
of COVID-19. The choice of ELM in this work has been motivated by its significantly shorter training
time as compared to conventional gradient-based learning algorithms. As bigger and diverse datasets
become available, it can be quickly retrained as compared to its gradient-based competitor models.
We use 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate the results of applying COV-ELM. The COV-ELM achieved
a macro average F1-score of 0.95 and the overall sensitivity of ${0.94 \pm 0.02}$ at a 95% confidence
interval. When compared to state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms, the COV-ELM is found
to outperform its competitors.

Japanese patents are assigned a patent classification code, FI (File Index), that is unique to Japan.
FI is a subdivision of the IPC, an international patent classification code, that is related to Japanese
technology. FIs are revised to keep up with technological developments. These revisions have already
established more than 30,000 new FIs since 2006. However, these revisions require a lot of time and
workload. Moreover, these revisions are not automated and are thus inefficient. Therefore, using
machine learning to assist in the revision of patent classification codes (FI) will lead to improved
accuracy and efficiency. This study analyzes patent documents from this new perspective of assisting
in the revision of patent classification codes with machine learning. To analyze time-series changes
in patents, we used the dynamic topic model (DTM), which is an extension of the latent Dirichlet allocation
(LDA). Also, unlike English, the Japanese language requires morphological analysis. Patents
contain many technical words that are not used in everyday life, so morphological analysis using
a common dictionary is not sufficient. Therefore, we used a technique for extracting technical
terms from text. After extracting technical terms, we applied them to DTM. In this study, we determined
the technological progress of the lighting class F21 for 14 years and compared it with the actual
revision of patent classification codes. In other words, we extracted technical terms from Japanese
patents and applied DTM to determine the progress of Japanese technology. Then, we analyzed the
results from the new perspective of revising patent classification codes with machine learning.
As a result, it was found that those whose topics were on the rise were judged to be new technologies.

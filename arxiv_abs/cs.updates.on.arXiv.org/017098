Relatively abundant availability of medical imaging data has provided significant support in
the development and testing of Neural Network based image processing methods. Clinicians often
face issues in selecting suitable image processing algorithm for medical imaging data. A strategy
for the selection of a proper model is presented here. The training data set comprises optical coherence
tomography (OCT) and angiography (OCT-A) images of 50 mice eyes with more than 100 days follow-up.
The data contains images from treated and untreated mouse eyes. Four deep learning variants are
tested for automatic (a) differentiation of tumor region with healthy retinal layer and (b) segmentation
of 3D ocular tumor volumes. Exhaustive sensitivity analysis of deep learning models is performed
with respect to the number of training and testing images using 8 eight performance indices to study
accuracy, reliability/reproducibility, and speed. U-net with UVgg16 is best for malign tumor
data set with treatment (having considerable variation) and U-net with Inception backbone for
benign tumor data (with minor variation). Loss value and root mean square error (R.M.S.E.) are found
most and least sensitive performance indices, respectively. The performance (via indices) is
found to be exponentially improving regarding a number of training images. The segmented OCT-Angiography
data shows that neovascularization drives the tumor volume. Image analysis shows that photodynamic
imaging-assisted tumor treatment protocol is transforming an aggressively growing tumor into
a cyst. An empirical expression is obtained to help medical professionals to choose a particular
model given the number of images and types of characteristics. We recommend that the presented exercise
should be taken as standard practice before employing a particular deep learning model for biomedical
image analysis.

The trade-off between the noise-sensitivity and the performance of disturbance estimation is
well-known in the Disturbance Observer- (DOb-) based motion control systems. As the bandwidth
of the DOb increases, not only the performance but also the frequency range of disturbance estimation
improves yet the motion controller becomes more sensitive to the noise of measurement system. This
trade-off is generally explained by considering only the noise of sensors such as encoders. However,
the digital implementation of the robust motion controller may significantly influence the noise
sensitivity and performance of disturbance estimation in practice. This paper shows that the conventional
DOb implemented by estimating velocity is subject to waterbed effect when the design parameters
(i.e., sampling-time, nominal plant parameters and the bandwidth of the DOb) are not properly tuned
in the digital motion controller synthesis. Therefore, the bandwidth of disturbance estimation
is limited by waterbed effect in addition to the noise of velocity measurement system. To facilitate
the digital motion controller synthesis, the design constraints of the conventional DOb are analytically
derived in this paper. When the digital motion controller is implemented by estimating acceleration,
waterbed effect does not occur, and good robust stability and performance can be achieved for all
values of the design parameters of the acceleration measurement-based DOb. The bandwidth of disturbance
estimation, however, cannot be freely increased due to the noise of acceleration sensors in practice.
By employing Bode Integral Theorem in the discrete-time domain, the design constraints of the DOb-based
digital motion control systems are clearly explained and it is shown that acceleration measurement
can be used to enhance the bandwidth of the DOb, i.e., the performance and frequency range of disturbance
estimation.

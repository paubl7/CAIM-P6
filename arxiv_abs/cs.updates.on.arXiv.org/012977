Global freight demand will triple between 2015 and 2050, based on the current demand pathway, as
predicted in the Transport Outlook 2019. Hence, a revolutionary change in transport efficiency
is urgently needed. One approach to tackle this change is to transfer the successful model of the
Digital Internet for data exchange to the physical transport of goods: The so-called Physical Internet
(PI, or $\pi$). The potential of the Physical Internet lies in dynamic routing, which increases
the utilization of transport modalities, like trucks and vans, and makes transport more efficient.
Previous concept transfers have identified and determined the $\pi$-nodes as routing entities.
Here, the problem is that the $\pi$-nodes have no information about real-time data on transport
vacancies. This leads to a great challenge for the $\pi$-nodes with regard to routing, in particular
in determining the next best appropriate node for onward transport of the freight package. This
paper evolved the state of research concept as an artifact that considers the $\pi$-nodes as routers
in a way that it distributes and replicates real-time data to the $\pi$-nodes in order to enable more
effective routing decisions. This real-time data is provided by vehicles, or so-called $\pi$-transporters,
on the road. Therefore, a second artifact will be designed in which $\pi$-transporters take over
the routing role. In order to be able to take a holistic perspective on the routing topic, the goods
that are actually to be moved, the so-called $\pi$-containers, are also designed as routing entities
in a third artifact. These three artifacts are then compared and evaluated for the consideration
of real-time traffic data. This paper proposes $\pi$-transporters as routing entities whose software
representatives negotiate freight handover points in a cloud-based marketplace.

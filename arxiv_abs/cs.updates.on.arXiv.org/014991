Graphs model real-world circumstances in many applications where they may constantly change to
capture the dynamic behavior of the phenomena. Topological persistence which provides a set of
birth and death pairs for the topological features is one instrument for analyzing such changing
graph data. However, standard persistent homology defined over a growing space cannot always capture
such a dynamic process unless shrinking with deletions is also allowed. Hence, zigzag persistence
which incorporates both insertions and deletions of simplices is more appropriate in such a setting.
Unlike standard persistence which admits nearly linear-time algorithms for graphs, such results
for the zigzag version improving the general $O(m^\omega)$ time complexity are not known, where
$\omega< 2.37286$ is the matrix multiplication exponent. In this paper, we propose algorithms
for zigzag persistence on graphs which run in near-linear time. Specifically, given a filtration
with $m$ additions and deletions on a graph with $n$ vertices and edges, the algorithm for $0$-dimension
runs in $O(m\log^2 n+m\log m)$ time and the algorithm for 1-dimension runs in $O(m\log^4 n)$ time.
The algorithm for $0$-dimension draws upon another algorithm designed originally for pairing
critical points of Morse functions on $2$-manifolds. The algorithm for $1$-dimension pairs a negative
edge with the earliest positive edge so that a $1$-cycle containing both edges resides in all intermediate
graphs. Both algorithms achieve the claimed time complexity via dynamic graph data structures
proposed by Holm et al. In the end, using Alexander duality, we extend the algorithm for $0$-dimension
to compute the $(p-1)$-dimensional zigzag persistence for $\mathbb{R}^p$-embedded complexes
in $O(m\log^2 n+m\log m+n\log n)$ time.

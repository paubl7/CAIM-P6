We propose a new method to estimate causal effects from nonexperimental data. Each pair of sample
units is first associated with a stochastic 'treatment' - differences in factors between units
- and an effect - a resultant outcome difference. It is then proposed that all such pairs can be combined
to provide more accurate estimates of causal effects in observational data, provided a statistical
model connecting combinatorial properties of treatments to the accuracy and unbiasedness of their
effects. The article introduces one such model and a Bayesian approach to combine the $O(n^2)$ pairwise
observations typically available in nonexperimnetal data. This also leads to an interpretation
of nonexperimental datasets as incomplete, or noisy, versions of ideal factorial experimental
designs. This approach to causal effect estimation has several advantages: (1) it expands the number
of observations, converting thousands of individuals into millions of observational treatments;
(2) starting with treatments closest to the experimental ideal, it identifies noncausal variables
that can be ignored in the future, making estimation easier in each subsequent iteration while departing
minimally from experiment-like conditions; (3) it recovers individual causal effects in heterogeneous
populations. We evaluate the method in simulations and the National Supported Work (NSW) program,
an intensively studied program whose effects are known from randomized field experiments. We demonstrate
that the proposed approach recovers causal effects in common NSW samples, as well as in arbitrary
subpopulations and an order-of-magnitude larger supersample with the entire national program
data, outperforming Statistical, Econometrics and Machine Learning estimators in all cases...

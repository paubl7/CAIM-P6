The alarmingly high mortality rate and increasing global prevalence of cardiovascular diseases
signify the crucial need for early detection schemes. Phonocardiogram (PCG) signals have been
historically applied in this domain owing to its simplicity and cost-effectiveness. In this paper,
we propose CardioXNet, a novel lightweight end-to-end CRNN architecture for automatic detection
of five classes of cardiac auscultation namely normal, aortic stenosis, mitral stenosis, mitral
regurgitation and mitral valve prolapse using raw PCG signal. The process has been automated by
the involvement of two learning phases. Three parallel CNN pathways have been implemented in the
representation learning phase to learn the coarse and fine-grained features from the PCG and to
explore the salient features from variable receptive fields involving 2D-CNN based squeeze-expansion.
Thus, in the representation learning phase, the network extracts efficient time-invariant features
and converges with great rapidity. In the sequential residual learning phase, with the bidirectional-LSTMs
and the skip connection, the network can proficiently extract temporal features without performing
any feature extraction on the signal. The obtained results demonstrate that the proposed end-to-end
architecture yields outstanding performance in all the evaluation metrics compared to the previous
state-of-the-art methods with up to 99.60% accuracy, 99.56% precision, 99.52% recall and 99.68%
F1- score on an average while being computationally comparable. This model outperforms the previous
works using the same dataset by a considerable margin. The high accuracy metrics on both primary
and secondary dataset combined with a significantly low number of parameters and end-to-end prediction
approach makes the proposed network suitable for point of care CVD screening in low resource setups
using memory constraint mobile devices.

In e-commerce, opinion tags refer to a ranked list of tags provided by the e-commerce platform that
reflect characteristics of reviews of an item. To assist consumers to quickly grasp a large number
of reviews about an item, opinion tags are increasingly being applied by e-commerce platforms.
Current mechanisms for generating opinion tags rely on either manual labelling or heuristic methods,
which is time-consuming and ineffective. In this paper, we propose the abstractive opinion tagging
task, where systems have to automatically generate a ranked list of opinion tags that are based on,
but need not occur in, a given set of user-generated reviews. The abstractive opinion tagging task
comes with three main challenges: (1) the noisy nature of reviews; (2) the formal nature of opinion
tags vs. the colloquial language usage in reviews; and (3) the need to distinguish between different
items with very similar aspects. To address these challenges, we propose an abstractive opinion
tagging framework, named AOT-Net, to generate a ranked list of opinion tags given a large number
of reviews. First, a sentence-level salience estimation component estimates each review's salience
score. Next, a review clustering and ranking component ranks reviews in two steps: first, reviews
are grouped into clusters and ranked by cluster size; then, reviews within each cluster are ranked
by their distance to the cluster center. Finally, given the ranked reviews, a rank-aware opinion
tagging component incorporates an alignment feature and alignment loss to generate a ranked list
of opinion tags. To facilitate the study of this task, we create and release a large-scale dataset,
called eComTag, crawled from real-world e-commerce websites. Extensive experiments conducted
on the eComTag dataset verify the effectiveness of the proposed AOT-Net in terms of various evaluation
metrics.

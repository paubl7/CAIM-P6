Purpose-Mock board exam is necessary to identify if the students are ready to take the board exam.
However, preparing for the examination is not easy. It takes too much time to release the result,
given that the College has limited personnel. Thus, the proponents developed the Dynamic Local
Area Network (LAN) Based Mock Board Examination System that makes the preparation and checking
easy. Method-The proponents followed the iterative waterfall model to develop the system efficiently.
Some criteria of ISO 25010 were adopted in the evaluation instrument. Simultaneously, evaluators
are composed of program chairperson, College of Computer Studies (CCS) faculty, board program
students, and alumni. Results-The result of 4.91 in Functional Suitability, 4.87 in Performance
Efficiency, 4.91 in Usability, 4.90 in Security, and 4.92 in Maintainability shows that the system
is fully functional and is usable by any board program. Conclusion The computer-based examination,
implemented through LAN, can simplify administering personnel of MinSCAT mock board examination.
The development of the "Dynamic LAN Based Mock Board Examination System" is a great help to the MinSCAT
and their board program graduates if it is implemented. Recommendations-The system has hidden
weaknesses that were only identified in actual operation. Thus, further testing is needed, like
beta testing, to identify and correct it for better performance. After beta-testing, the system
can be improved through iteration of the Waterfall Model phases. Research Implications-The developed
system can improve the mock board examination process and ease preparing this significant examination.
Moreover, it immediately provides a result that helps the examinees to identify their weaknesses
and do a further review to master it.

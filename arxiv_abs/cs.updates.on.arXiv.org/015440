Chest X-rays (CXRs) are the most commonly performed diagnostic examination to detect cardiopulmonary
abnormalities. However, the presence of bony structures such as ribs and clavicles can obscure
subtle abnormalities resulting in diagnostic errors. This study aims to build a deep learning (DL)-based
bone suppression model that identifies and removes these occluding bony structures in frontal
CXRs to assist in reducing errors in radiological interpretation, including DL workflows, related
to detecting manifestations consistent with Tuberculosis (TB). Several bone suppression models
with various deep architectures are trained and their performances are evaluated in a cross-institutional
test setting. The best-performing model (ResNet-BS) is used to suppress bones in the Shenzhen and
Montgomery TB CXR collections. A VGG-16 model is pretrained on a large collection of publicly available
CXRs. The CXR-pretrained model is then fine-tuned individually on the non-bone-suppressed and
bone-suppressed CXRs of Shenzhen and Montgomery TB CXR collections to classify them as showing
normal lungs or TB manifestations. The performances of these models are compared using several
performance metrics, analyzed for statistical significance, and their predictions are qualitatively
interpreted through class-selective relevance maps (CRM). It is observed that the models trained
on bone-suppressed CXRs significantly outperformed the models trained individually on the non-bone-suppressed
CXRs (p<0.05) in the Shenzhen and Montgomery TB collections. Models trained on bone-suppressed
CXRs improved detection of TB-consistent findings and resulted in compact clustering of the data
points in the feature space signifying that bone suppression improved the model sensitivity toward
TB classification.

An elastic-degenerate (ED) string is a sequence of $n$ sets of strings of total length $N$, which
was recently proposed to model a set of similar sequences. The ED string matching (EDSM) problem
is to find all occurrences of a pattern of length $m$ in an ED text. An $O(nm^{1.5}\sqrt{\log m}+N)$-time
algorithm for EDSM is known [Aoyama et al., CPM 2018]. The standard assumption in the prior work on
this question is that $N$ is substantially larger than both $n$ and $m$, and thus we would like to have
a linear dependency on the former. Under this assumption, the natural open problem is whether we
can decrease the 1.5 exponent in the time complexity, similarly as in the related (but, to the best
of our knowledge, not equivalent) word break problem [Backurs and Indyk, FOCS 2016]. Our starting
point is a conditional lower bound for EDSM. We use the popular combinatorial Boolean Matrix Multiplication
(BMM) conjecture stating that there is no truly subcubic combinatorial algorithm for BMM [Abboud
and Williams, FOCS 2014]. By designing an appropriate reduction we show that a combinatorial algorithm
solving the EDSM problem in $O(nm^{1.5-e}+N)$ time, for any $e>0$, refutes this conjecture. Our
reduction should be understood as an indication that decreasing the exponent requires fast matrix
multiplication. String periodicity and fast Fourier transform are two standard tools in string
algorithms. Our main technical contribution is that we successfully combine these tools with fast
matrix multiplication to design a non-combinatorial $\tilde{O}(nm^{\omega-1}+N)$-time algorithm
for EDSM, where $\omega$ denotes the matrix multiplication exponent. To the best of our knowledge,
we are the first to combine these tools. In particular, using the fact that $\omega<2.373$ [Le Gall,
ISSAC 2014; Williams, STOC 2012], we obtain an $O(nm^{1.373}+N)$-time algorithm for EDSM.

The CycleGAN framework allows for unsupervised image-to-image translation of unpaired data.
In a scenario of surgical training on a physical surgical simulator, this method can be used to transform
endoscopic images of phantoms into images which more closely resemble the intra-operative appearance
of the same surgical target structure. This can be viewed as a novel augmented reality approach,
which we coined Hyperrealism in previous work. In this use case, it is of paramount importance to
display objects like needles, sutures or instruments consistent in both domains while altering
the style to a more tissue-like appearance. Segmentation of these objects would allow for a direct
transfer, however, contouring of these, partly tiny and thin foreground objects is cumbersome
and perhaps inaccurate. Instead, we propose to use landmark detection on the points when sutures
pass into the tissue. This objective is directly incorporated into a CycleGAN framework by treating
the performance of pre-trained detector models as an additional optimization goal. We show that
a task defined on these sparse landmark labels improves consistency of synthesis by the generator
network in both domains. Comparing a baseline CycleGAN architecture to our proposed extension
(DetCycleGAN), mean precision (PPV) improved by +61.32, mean sensitivity (TPR) by +37.91, and
mean F1 score by +0.4743. Furthermore, it could be shown that by dataset fusion, generated intra-operative
images can be leveraged as additional training data for the detection network itself. The data is

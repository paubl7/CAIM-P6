Power networks, responsible for transporting electricity across large geographical regions,
are complex infrastructures on which modern life critically depend. Variations in demand and production
profiles, with increasing renewable energy integration, as well as the high voltage network technology,
constitute a real challenge for human operators when optimizing electricity transportation while
avoiding blackouts. Motivated to investigate the potential of Artificial Intelligence methods
in enabling adaptability in power network operation, we have designed a L2RPN challenge to encourage
the development of reinforcement learning solutions to key problems present in the next-generation
power networks. The NeurIPS 2020 competition was well received by the international community
attracting over 300 participants worldwide. The main contribution of this challenge is our proposed
comprehensive Grid2Op framework, and associated benchmark, which plays realistic sequential
network operations scenarios. The framework is open-sourced and easily re-usable to define new
environments with its companion GridAlive ecosystem. It relies on existing non-linear physical
simulators and let us create a series of perturbations and challenges that are representative of
two important problems: a) the uncertainty resulting from the increased use of unpredictable renewable
energy sources, and b) the robustness required with contingent line disconnections. In this paper,
we provide details about the competition highlights. We present the benchmark suite and analyse
the winning solutions of the challenge, observing one super-human performance demonstration
by the best agent. We propose our organizational insights for a successful competition and conclude
on open research avenues. We expect our work will foster research to create more sustainable solutions
for power network operations.

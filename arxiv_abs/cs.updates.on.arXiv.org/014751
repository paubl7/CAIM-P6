Non-invasive and cost effective in nature, the echocardiogram allows for a comprehensive assessment
of the cardiac musculature and valves. Despite progressive improvements over the decades, the
rich temporally resolved data in echocardiography videos remain underutilized. Human reads of
echocardiograms reduce the complex patterns of cardiac wall motion, to a small list of measurements
of heart function. Furthermore, all modern echocardiography artificial intelligence (AI) systems
are similarly limited by design - automating measurements of the same reductionist metrics rather
than utilizing the wealth of data embedded within each echo study. This underutilization is most
evident in situations where clinical decision making is guided by subjective assessments of disease
acuity, and tools that predict disease onset within clinically actionable timeframes are unavailable.
Predicting the likelihood of developing post-operative right ventricular failure (RV failure)
in the setting of mechanical circulatory support is one such clinical example. To address this,
we developed a novel video AI system trained to predict post-operative right ventricular failure
(RV failure), using the full spatiotemporal density of information from pre-operative echocardiography
scans. We achieve an AUC of 0.729, specificity of 52% at 80% sensitivity and 46% sensitivity at 80%
specificity. Furthermore, we show that our ML system significantly outperforms a team of human
experts tasked with predicting RV failure on independent clinical evaluation. Finally, the methods
we describe are generalizable to any cardiac clinical decision support application where treatment
or patient selection is guided by qualitative echocardiography assessments.

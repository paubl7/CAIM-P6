Domain adversarial training has become a prevailing and effective paradigm for unsupervised domain
adaptation (UDA). To successfully align the multi-modal data structures across domains, the following
works exploit discriminative information in the adversarial training process, e.g., using multiple
class-wise discriminators and introducing conditional information in input or output of the domain
discriminator. However, these methods either require non-trivial model designs or are inefficient
for UDA tasks. In this work, we attempt to address this dilemma by devising simple and compact conditional
domain adversarial training methods. We first show that the previous failure of the concatenation
conditioning strategy mainly accounts for the weak support of the conditioning. Thus we propose
an effective concatenation conditioning strategy by introducing a norm control factor to strengthen
the conditioning and term the derived method as \underline{S}emantic \underline{D}omain \underline{A}dversarial
\underline{N}etworks~(SDAN). However, directly applying predictions for conditional domain
alignment, SDAN still suffers from inaccurate target predictions. We further propose a novel structure-aware
conditioning strategy to enhance SDAN by conditioning the cross-domain feature alignment in the
structure-aware semantic space rather than in the prediction space. We term the enhanced method
as \underline{S}tructure-aware \underline{S}emantic \underline{D}omain \underline{A}dversarial
\underline{N}etworks~(SSDAN). Experiments on both object recognition and semantic segmentation
show that SDAN effectively aligns the multi-modal structures across domains and even outperforms
state-of-the-art domain adversarial training methods. With structure-aware semantic conditioning,
SSDAN further improves the adaptation performance over SDAN on multiple object recognition benchmarks
for UDA.

In the recent years, there has been a shift in facial behavior analysis from the laboratory-controlled
conditions to the challenging in-the-wild conditions due to the superior performance of deep learning
based approaches for many real world applications.However, the performance of deep learning approaches
relies on the amount of training data. One of the major problems with data acquisition is the requirement
of annotations for large amount of training data. Labeling process of huge training data demands
lot of human support with strong domain expertise for facial expressions or action units, which
is difficult to obtain in real-time environments.Moreover, labeling process is highly vulnerable
to ambiguity of expressions or action units, especially for intensities due to the bias induced
by the domain experts. Therefore, there is an imperative need to address the problem of facial behavior
analysis with weak annotations. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive review of weakly supervised
learning (WSL) approaches for facial behavior analysis with both categorical as well as dimensional
labels along with the challenges and potential research directions associated with it. First,
we introduce various types of weak annotations in the context of facial behavior analysis and the
corresponding challenges associated with it. We then systematically review the existing state-of-the-art
approaches and provide a taxonomy of these approaches along with their insights and limitations.
In addition, widely used data-sets in the reviewed literature and the performance of these approaches
along with evaluation principles are summarized. Finally, we discuss the remaining challenges
and opportunities along with the potential research directions in order to apply facial behavior
analysis with weak labels in real life situations.

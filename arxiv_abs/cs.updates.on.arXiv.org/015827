Very large time series are increasingly available from an ever wider range of IoT-enabled sensors
deployed in different environments. Significant insights can be obtained through mining temporal
patterns from these time series. Unlike traditional pattern mining, temporal pattern mining (TPM)
adds additional temporal aspect, e.g., the time intervals of the events, into extracted patterns,
making them more expressive. However, adding this extra temporal information to the patterns also
adds an additional exponential factor to the exponential growth of the search space, increases
significantly the mining complexity. This raises an imperative need to have a more efficient and
scalable method for temporal pattern mining. Existing TPM methods either cannot scale to large
datasets, or work only on pre-processed temporal events rather than on time series. This paper presents
our comprehensive Frequent Temporal Pattern Mining from Time Series (FTPMfTS) with the following
contributions: (1) The end-to-end FTPMfTS process that directly takes time series as input and
produces frequent temporal patterns as output. (2) The efficient Hierarchical Temporal Pattern
Graph Mining (HTPGM) algorithm that uses efficient data structures to enable fast computations
of support and confidence, and employs effective pruning techniques to achieve significantly
faster mining. (3) An approximate version of HTPGM which relies on mutual information to prune unpromising
time series, and thus significantly reduce the search space. (4) An extensive experimental evaluation
on synthetic and real-world datasets shows that HTPGM outperforms the baselines in runtime and
memory consumption, and can scale to big datasets. The approximate HTPGM achieves up to 2 orders
of magnitude speedup compared to the baselines while having high accuracy compared to the exact
HTPGM.

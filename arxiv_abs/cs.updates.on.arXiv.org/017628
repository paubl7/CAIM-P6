As more and more renewable intermittent generations are being connected to the distribution grid,
the grid operators require more flexibility to maintain the balance between supply and demand.
The intermittencies give rise to situations which require not only slow-ramping flexibility capability
but also, fast-ramping flexibility capability from a variety of resources connected at the MV and
LV distribution grids. Moreover, the intermittencies may increase the costs of grid reinforcement.
Therefore, to defer the reinforcement of the grid assets, the grid needs to be operated optimally.
This paper proposes - a) such an optimal operational methodology for the MV and LV grids; and b) an
aggregated flexibility estimation methodology estimated separately for fast and slow services
at the primary substation (TSO interface). The methodologies based on model-based MV grids and
a sensitivity coefficients-based model-less LV grids are suitable for LV grids where an up-to-date
and accurate model and topology are not always available. The approaches of the paper use the synchronised
and accurate measurements from grid monitoring devices located at the LV distribution grids. It
is assumed that the implementation of the methodology is centralised, where a grid monitoring device
or a central platform is capable to host grid aware algorithms and to communicate control setpoints
to DERs. The approaches have been validated on a real MV and LV networks of a Swiss DSO equipped with
grid monitoring devices. The results, in terms of technical losses, grid violation costs and flexibility
capability curve, show the efficacy of the optimal operation and flexibility estimation methodologies
and therefore, can be easily deployed.

Efficiently computable stability and performance analysis of nonlinear systems becomes increasingly
more important in practical applications. An elegant notion that can express stability and performance
jointly is dissipativity. However, existing dissipativity analysis conditions are usually only
formulated around an equilibrium point of the nonlinear system and usually involve cumbersome
computations. Analyzing stability based on the convergence of the trajectories of the nonlinear
system, i.e., incremental stability analysis, has shown to solve the first issue. However, how
stability and performance characterizations of nonlinear systems in the incremental framework
are linked to dissipativity, and how general performance characterization beyond the $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain
concept can be understood in the incremental framework is largely unknown. By systematically establishing
the missing links, this paper presents a matrix inequalities based convex dissipativity analysis
with the use of quadratic storage and supply functions, for a rather general class of systems with
smooth nonlinearities. The proposed dissipativity analysis links the notions of differential,
incremental and general dissipativity by a chain of implications. We show that through differential
dissipativity, incremental and general dissipativity of the nonlinear system can be guaranteed.
Using the results from the aforementioned chain of implications, incremental extensions for the
analysis of the $\mathcal{L}_2$-gain, the generalized $\mathcal{H}_2$-norm, the $\mathcal{L}_\infty$-gain
and passivity of a nonlinear system are presented. Moreover, we give a convex computation method
to solve the obtained conditions. The effectiveness of the analysis tools are demonstrated by means
of an academic example.

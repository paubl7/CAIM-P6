Tensor (multidimensional array) classification problem has become very popular in modern applications
such as image recognition and high dimensional spatio-temporal data analysis. Support Tensor
Machine (STM) classifier, which is extended from the support vector machine, takes CANDECOMP /
Parafac (CP) form of tensor data as input and predicts the data labels. The distribution-free and
statistically consistent properties of STM highlight its potential in successfully handling
wide varieties of data applications. Training a STM can be computationally expensive with high-dimensional
tensors. However, reducing the size of tensor with a random projection technique can reduce the
computational time and cost, making it feasible to handle large size tensors on regular machines.
We name an STM estimated with randomly projected tensor as Random Projection-based Support Tensor
Machine (RPSTM). In this work, we propose a Tensor Ensemble Classifier (TEC), which aggregates
multiple RPSTMs for big tensor classification. TEC utilizes the ensemble idea to minimize the excessive
classification risk brought by random projection, providing statistically consistent predictions
while taking the computational advantage of RPSTM. Since each RPSTM can be estimated independently,
TEC can further take advantage of parallel computing techniques and be more computationally efficient.
The theoretical and numerical results demonstrate the decent performance of TEC model in high-dimensional
tensor classification problems. The model prediction is statistically consistent as its risk
is shown to converge to the optimal Bayes risk. Besides, we highlight the trade-off between the computational
cost and the prediction risk for TEC model. The method is validated by extensive simulation and a
real data example. We prepare a python package for applying TEC, which is available at our GitHub.

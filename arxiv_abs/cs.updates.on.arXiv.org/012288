The goal of text ranking is to generate an ordered list of texts retrieved from a corpus in response
to a query. Although the most common formulation of text ranking is search, instances of the task
can also be found in many natural language processing applications. This survey provides an overview
of text ranking with neural network architectures known as transformers, of which BERT is the best-known
example. The combination of transformers and self-supervised pretraining has, without exaggeration,
revolutionized the fields of natural language processing (NLP), information retrieval (IR),
and beyond. In this survey, we provide a synthesis of existing work as a single point of entry for practitioners
who wish to gain a better understanding of how to apply transformers to text ranking problems and
researchers who wish to pursue work in this area. We cover a wide range of modern techniques, grouped
into two high-level categories: transformer models that perform reranking in multi-stage ranking
architectures and learned dense representations that attempt to perform ranking directly. There
are two themes that pervade our survey: techniques for handling long documents, beyond the typical
sentence-by-sentence processing approaches used in NLP, and techniques for addressing the tradeoff
between effectiveness (result quality) and efficiency (query latency). Although transformer
architectures and pretraining techniques are recent innovations, many aspects of how they are
applied to text ranking are relatively well understood and represent mature techniques. However,
there remain many open research questions, and thus in addition to laying out the foundations of
pretrained transformers for text ranking, this survey also attempts to prognosticate where the
field is heading.

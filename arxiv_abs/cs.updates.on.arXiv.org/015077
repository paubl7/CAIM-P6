Plateaued functions as an extension of bent functions play a significant role in cryptography,
coding theory, sequences and combinatorics. In 2019, Hod\v{z}i\'{c} et al. designed Boolean plateaued
functions in spectral domain and provided some efficient construction methods in spectral domain.
However, in their constructions, the Walsh support of Boolean $s$-plateaued functions in $n$ variables
contains at least $n-s$ columns corresponding to affine functions on $\mathbb{F}_{2}^{n-s}$.
In this paper, we study generalized $s$-plateaued functions from $V_{n}$ to $\mathbb{Z}_{p^k}$
where $p$ is an odd prime and $k\geq 1$ or $p=2, k\geq 2$ and $n+s$ is even. Firstly, inspired by the
work of Hod\v{z}i\'{c} et al., we give a complete characterization of generalized plateaued functions
with affine Walsh support and provide some construction methods of generalized plateaued functions
with (non)-affine Walsh support in spectral domain. In our constructions, the Walsh support can
contain strictly less than $n-s$ columns corresponding to affine functions and our construction
methods are also applicable to Boolean plateaued functions. Secondly, we provide a generalized
indirect sum construction method of generalized plateaued functions, which can also be used to
construct (non)-weakly regular generalized bent functions. In particular, we show that the canonical
way to construct Generalized Maiorana-McFarland bent functions is a special case of the generalized
indirect sum construction method and we illustrate that the generalized indirect sum construction
method can be used to construct bent functions not in the complete Generalized Maiorana-McFarland
class. Furthermore, based on this construction method, we give constructions of plateaued functions
in the subclass WRP of the class of weakly regular plateaued functions and vectorial plateaued functions.

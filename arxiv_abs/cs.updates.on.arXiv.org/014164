We give the first approximate-near-neighbor data structures for time series under the continuous
Fr\'echet distance. For an attainable approximation factor $c>1$, the data structure can be used
to preprocess $n$ curves in $\mathbb{R}$ (aka time series), each of complexity $m$, to answer queries
with a curve of complexity $k$ by either returning a curve that lies within Fr\'echet distance $c$,
or answering that there exists no curve in the input within distance $1$. In both cases, the answer
is correct. Our first data structure achieves a $(5+\epsilon)$ approximation factor, uses space
in $n\cdot \mathcal{O}\left({\epsilon^{-1}}\right)^{k} + \mathcal{O}(nm)$ and has query time
in $\mathcal{O}\left(k\right)$. Our second data structure achieves a $(2+\epsilon)$ approximation
factor, uses space in $n\cdot \mathcal{O}\left(\frac{m}{k\epsilon}\right)^{k} + \mathcal{O}(nm)$
and has query time in $\mathcal{O}\left(k\cdot 2^k\right)$. As an indicator of hardness, we show
that for any data structure which achieves an approximation factor less than $2$ and which supports
curves of arclength at most $L$, uses a word size bounded by $\mathcal{O}(L^{1-\epsilon})$ for
some constant $\epsilon>0$, and answers the query using only a constant number of probes, the number
of words used to store the data structure must be at least $L^{\Omega(k)}$. Our third positive result
is a probabilistic data structure based on locality-sensitive hashing, which achieves space in
$\mathcal{O}(nm)$ and query time in $\mathcal{O}(k)$, and which answers queries with an approximation
factor in $\mathcal{O}(k)$. All of our data structures make use of the concept of signatures, which
were originally introduced for the problem of clustering time series under the Fr\'echet distance.

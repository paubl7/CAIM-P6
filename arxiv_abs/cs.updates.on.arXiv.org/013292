The Grammar of Institutions, or Institutional Grammar, is an established approach to encode policy
information in terms of institutional statements based on a set of pre-defined syntactic components.
This codebook provides coding guidelines for a revised version of the Institutional Grammar, the
Institutional Grammar 2.0 (IG 2.0). IG 2.0 is a specification that aims at facilitating the encoding
of policy to meet varying analytical objectives. To this end, it revises the grammar with respect
to comprehensiveness, flexibility, and specificity by offering multiple levels of expressiveness
(IG Core, IG Extended, IG Logico). In addition to the encoding of regulative statements, it further
introduces the encoding of constitutive institutional statements, as well as statements that
exhibit both constitutive and regulative characteristics. Introducing those aspects, the codebook
initially covers fundamental concepts of IG 2.0, before providing an overview of pre-coding steps
relevant for document preparation. Detailed coding guidelines are provided for both regulative
and constitutive statements across all levels of expressiveness, along with the encoding guidelines
for statements of mixed form -- hybrid and polymorphic institutional statements. The document
further provides an overview of taxonomies used in the encoding process and referred to throughout
the codebook. The codebook concludes with a summary and discussion of relevant considerations
to facilitate the coding process. An initial Reader's Guide helps the reader tailor the content
to her interest. Note that this codebook specifically focuses on operational aspects of IG 2.0 in
the context of policy coding. Links to additional resources such as the underlying scientific literature
(that offers a comprehensive treatment of the underlying theoretical concepts) are referred to
in the concluding section of the codebook.

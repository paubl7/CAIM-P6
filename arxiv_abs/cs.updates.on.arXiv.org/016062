Previous studies have characterized code comments in various programming languages to support
better program comprehension activities and maintenance tasks. However, very few studies have
focused on understanding developer practices to write comments. None of them has compared such
developer practices to the standard comment guidelines to study the extent to which developers
follow the guidelines. This paper reports the first empirical study investigating commenting
practices in Pharo Smalltalk. First, we analyze class comment evolution over seven Pharo versions.
Then, we investigate the information types embedded in class comments. Finally, we study the adherence
of developer commenting practices to the official class comment template over Pharo versions.
The results of this study show that there is a rapid increase in class comments in the initial three
Pharo versions, while in subsequent versions developers added comments to both new and old classes,
thus maintaining a similar code to comment ratio. We furthermore found three times as many information
types in class comments as those suggested by the template. However, the information types suggested
by the template tend to be present more often than other types of information. Additionally, we find
that a substantial proportion of comments follow the writing style of the template in writing these
information types, but they are written and formatted in a non-uniform way.This suggests the need
to standardize the commenting guidelines for formatting the text, and to provide headers for the
different information types to ensure a consistent style and to identify the information easily.
Given the importance of high-quality code comments, we draw numerous implications for developers
and researchers to improve the support for comment quality assessment tools.

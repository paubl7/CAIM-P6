The 3rd edition of the Montreal AI Ethics Institute's The State of AI Ethics captures the most relevant
developments in AI Ethics since October 2020. It aims to help anyone, from machine learning experts
to human rights activists and policymakers, quickly digest and understand the field's ever-changing
developments. Through research and article summaries, as well as expert commentary, this report
distills the research and reporting surrounding various domains related to the ethics of AI, including:
algorithmic injustice, discrimination, ethical AI, labor impacts, misinformation, privacy,
risk and security, social media, and more. In addition, The State of AI Ethics includes exclusive
content written by world-class AI Ethics experts from universities, research institutes, consulting
firms, and governments. Unique to this report is "The Abuse and Misogynoir Playbook," written by
Dr. Katlyn Tuner (Research Scientist, Space Enabled Research Group, MIT), Dr. Danielle Wood (Assistant
Professor, Program in Media Arts and Sciences; Assistant Professor, Aeronautics and Astronautics;
Lead, Space Enabled Research Group, MIT) and Dr. Catherine D'Ignazio (Assistant Professor, Urban
Science and Planning; Director, Data + Feminism Lab, MIT). The piece (and accompanying infographic),
is a deep-dive into the historical and systematic silencing, erasure, and revision of Black women's
contributions to knowledge and scholarship in the United Stations, and globally. Exposing and
countering this Playbook has become increasingly important following the firing of AI Ethics expert
Dr. Timnit Gebru (and several of her supporters) at Google. This report should be used not only as
a point of reference and insight on the latest thinking in the field of AI Ethics, but should also be
used as a tool for introspection as we aim to foster a more nuanced conversation regarding the impacts
of AI on the world.

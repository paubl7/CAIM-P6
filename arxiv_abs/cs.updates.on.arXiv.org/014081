Deep learning approaches may help radiologists in the early diagnosis and timely treatment of cerebrovascular
diseases. Accurate cerebral vessel segmentation of Time-of-Flight Magnetic Resonance Angiographs
(TOF-MRAs) is an essential step in this process. This study investigates deep learning approaches
for automatic, fast and accurate cerebrovascular segmentation for TOF-MRAs. The performance
of several data augmentation and selection methods for training a 2D and 3D U-Net for vessel segmentation
was investigated in five experiments: a) without augmentation, b) Gaussian blur, c) rotation and
flipping, d) Gaussian blur, rotation and flipping and e) different input patch sizes. All experiments
were performed by patch-training both a 2D and 3D U-Net and predicted on a test set of MRAs. Ground
truth was manually defined using an interactive threshold and region growing method. The performance
was evaluated using the Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC), Modified Hausdorff Distance and Volumetric
Similarity, between the predicted images and the interactively defined ground truth. The segmentation
performance of all trained networks on the test set was found to be good, with DSC scores ranging from
0.72 to 0.83. Both the 2D and 3D U-Net had the best segmentation performance with Gaussian blur, rotation
and flipping compared to other experiments without augmentation or only one of those augmentation
techniques. Additionally, training on larger patches or slices gave optimal segmentation results.
In conclusion, vessel segmentation can be optimally performed on TOF-MRAs using a trained 3D U-Net
on larger patches, where data augmentation including Gaussian blur, rotation and flipping was
performed on the training data.

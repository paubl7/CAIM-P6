This paper introduces a sharp interface method to simulate fluid-structure interaction (FSI)
involving rigid bodies immersed in viscous incompressible fluids. The capabilities of this methodology
are demonstrated for a range of benchmark test cases along with large-scale models of biomedical
FSI. The numerical approach developed herein, which we refer to as an immersed Lagrangian-Eulerian
method, integrates aspects of partitioned and immersed FSI formulations by solving separate momentum
equations for the fluid and solid subdomains, as in a partitioned formulation, while also using
non-conforming discretizations of the dynamic fluid and structure regions, as in an immersed formulation.
A Dirichlet-Neumann coupling scheme is used, in which the motion of the immersed solid is driven
by fluid traction forces evaluated along the fluid-structure interface, and the motion of the fluid
along that interface is constrained to match the solid velocity and thereby satisfy the no-slip
condition. To develop a practical numerical method, we adopt a penalty approach that approximately
imposes the no-slip condition along the fluid-structure interface. Our fluid-structure interaction
scheme relies on an immersed interface method for discrete geometries, which enables the accurate
determination of both velocities and stresses along complex fluid-structure interfaces. Unlike
commonly used partitioned FSI methods, which can suffer from so-called added mass effect instabilities,
our methodology retains stability for test cases involving extremely small, nearly equal, equal,
and large solid-fluid density ratios without requiring subiterations or complex handling of the
pressure. Biomedical FSI demonstration cases are also presented including the dynamics of a bileaflet
mechanical heart valve in a pulse duplicator, and transport of blood clots in a patient-averaged
anatomical model of the inferior vena cava.

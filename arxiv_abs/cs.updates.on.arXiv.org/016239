Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) consist of inter-wined computational (cyber) and physical components
interacting through sensors and/or actuators. Computational elements are networked at every
scale and can communicate with each others and with humans. Nodes can join and leave the network at
any time or they can move to different spatial locations. %operating at multiple spatial and temporal
scales. In this scenario, monitoring spatial and temporal properties plays a key role in understanding
of how complex behaviors can emerge from local and dynamic interactions. We propose here the Spatio-Temporal
Reach and Escape Logic, (STREL), a logic-based formal language designed to express and monitor
spatio-temporal requirements over the execution of mobile and spatially distributed CPS. STREL
considers the physical space in which CPS entities (nodes of the graph) are arranged as a weighted
graph representing their dynamic topological configuration. Both nodes and edges have attributes
modelling physical and logical quantities that can evolve over time. STREL combines the Signal
Temporal Logic with two spatial modalities reach and escape that operate over the weighted graph.
From these basic operators, we can derive other important spatial modalities such as everywhere,
somewhere and surround. We propose both a qualitative and quantitative semantics based on constraint
semirings, an algebraic structure suitable for constraint satisfaction and optimisation. We
provide an offline monitoring algorithm for STREL and we show the feasibility of our approach with
the application to two case studies: monitoring spatio-temporal requirements over a simulated
mobile ad-hoc sensor network and a simulated epidemic spreading model for COVID19.

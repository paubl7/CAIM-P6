COVID-19 infection caused by SARS-CoV-2 pathogen is a catastrophic pandemic outbreak all over
the world with exponential increasing of confirmed cases and, unfortunately, deaths. In this work
we propose an AI-powered pipeline, based on the deep-learning paradigm, for automated COVID-19
detection and lesion categorization from CT scans. We first propose a new segmentation module aimed
at identifying automatically lung parenchyma and lobes. Next, we combined such segmentation network
with classification networks for COVID-19 identification and lesion categorization. We compare
the obtained classification results with those obtained by three expert radiologists on a dataset
consisting of 162 CT scans. Results showed a sensitivity of 90\% and a specificity of 93.5% for COVID-19
detection, outperforming those yielded by the expert radiologists, and an average lesion categorization
accuracy of over 84%. Results also show that a significant role is played by prior lung and lobe segmentation
that allowed us to enhance performance by over 20 percent points. The interpretation of the trained
AI models, moreover, reveals that the most significant areas for supporting the decision on COVID-19
identification are consistent with the lesions clinically associated to the virus, i.e., crazy
paving, consolidation and ground glass. This means that the artificial models are able to discriminate
a positive patient from a negative one (both controls and patients with interstitial pneumonia
tested negative to COVID) by evaluating the presence of those lesions into CT scans. Finally, the
AI models are integrated into a user-friendly GUI to support AI explainability for radiologists,

A Peer-to-Peer (P2P) network is a dynamic collection of nodes that connect with each other via virtual
overlay links built upon an underlying network (usually, the Internet). P2P networks are highly
dynamic and can experience very heavy churn, i.e., a large number of nodes join/leave the network
continuously. Thus, building and maintaining a stable overlay network is an important problem
that has been studied extensively for two decades. In this paper, we present our \Pe overlay network
called Sparse Robust Addressable Network (Spartan). Spartan can be quickly and efficiently built
in a fully distributed fashion within $O(\log n)$ rounds. Furthermore, the Spartan overlay structure
can be maintained, again, in a fully distributed manner despite adversarially controlled churn
(i.e., nodes joining and leaving) and significant variation in the number of nodes. Moreover, new
nodes can join a committee within $O(1)$ rounds and leaving nodes can leave without any notice. The
number of nodes in the network lies in $[n, fn]$ for any fixed $f\ge 1$. Up to $\epsilon n$ nodes (for
some small but fixed $\epsilon > 0$) can be adversarially added/deleted within {\em any} period
of $P$ rounds for some $P \in O(\log \log n)$. Despite such uncertainty in the network, Spartan maintains
$\Theta(n/\log n)$ committees that are stable and addressable collections of $\Theta(\log n)$
nodes each for $O(polylog(n))$ rounds with high probability. Spartan's committees are also capable
of performing sustained computation and passing messages between each other. Thus, any protocol
designed for static networks can be simulated on Spartan with minimal overhead. This makes Spartan
an ideal platform for developing applications. We experimentally show that Spartan will remain
robust as long as each committee, on average, contains 24 nodes for networks of size up to $10240$.

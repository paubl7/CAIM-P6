DualSPHysics is a weakly compressible smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) Navier-Stokes solver
initially conceived to deal with coastal engineering problems, especially those related to wave
impact with coastal structures. Since the first release back in 2011, DualSPHysics has shown to
be robust and accurate for simulating extreme wave events along with a continuous improvement in
efficiency thanks to the exploitation of hardware such as graphics processing units (GPUs) for
scientific computing or the coupling with wave propagating models such as SWASH and OceanWave3D.
Numerous additional functionalities have also been included in the DualSPHysics package over
the last few years which allow the simulation of fluid-driven objects. The use of the discrete element
method (DEM) has allowed the solver to simulate the interaction among different bodies (sliding
rocks, for example), which provides a unique tool to analyse debris flows. In addition, the recent
coupling with other solvers like Project Chrono or MoorDyn has been a milestone in the development
of the solver. Project Chrono allows the simulation of articulated structures with joints, hinges,
sliders and springs and MoorDyn allows simulating moored structures. Both functionalities make
DualSPHysics one of the meshless model world leaders in the simulation of offshore energy harvesting
devices. Lately, the present state of maturity of the solver goes beyond single phase simulations,
allowing multi-phase simulations with gas-liquid and a combination of Newtonian and non-Newtonian
models expanding further the capabilities and range of applications for the DualSPHysics solver.
These advances and functionalities make DualSPHysics a state-of-the-art meshless solver with
emphasis on free-surface flow modelling.

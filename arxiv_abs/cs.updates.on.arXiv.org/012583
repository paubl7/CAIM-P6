Enterprise Networks, over the years, have become more and more complex trying to keep up with new
requirements that challenge traditional solutions. Just to mention one out of many possible examples,
technologies such as Virtual LANs (VLANs) struggle to address the scalability and operational
requirements introduced by Internet of Things (IoT) use cases. To keep up with these challenges
we have identified four main requirements that are common across modern enterprise networks: (i)
scalable mobility, (ii) endpoint segmentation, (iii) simplified administration, and (iv) resource
optimization. To address these challenges we designed SDA (Software Defined Access), a solution
for modern enterprise networks that leverages Software-Defined Networking (SDN) and other state
of the art techniques. In this paper we present the design, implementation and evaluation of SDA.
Specifically, SDA: (i) leverages a combination of an overlay approach with an event-driven protocol
(LISP) to dynamically adapt to traffic and mobility patterns while preserving resources, and (ii)
enforces dynamic endpoint groups for scalable segmentation with low operational burden. We present
our experience with deploying SDA in two real-life scenarios: an enterprise campus, and a large
warehouse with mobile robots. Our evaluation shows that SDA, when compared with traditional enterprise
networks, can (i) reduce overall data plane forwarding state up to 70% thanks to a reactive protocol
using a centralized routing server, and (ii) reduce by an order of magnitude the handover delays
in scenarios of massive mobility with respect to other approaches. Finally, we discuss lessons
learned while deploying and operating SDA, and possible optimizations regarding the use of an event-driven
protocol and group-based segmentation.

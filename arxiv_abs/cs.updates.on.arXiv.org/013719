Compared to NDT and health monitoring method for cracks in engineering structures, surface crack
detection or identification based on visible light images is non-contact, with the advantages
of fast speed, low cost and high precision. Firstly, typical pavement (concrete also) crack public
data sets were collected, and the characteristics of sample images as well as the random variable
factors, including environmental, noise and interference etc., were summarized. Subsequently,
the advantages and disadvantages of three main crack identification methods (i.e., hand-crafted
feature engineering, machine learning, deep learning) were compared. Finally, from the aspects
of model architecture, testing performance and predicting effectiveness, the development and
progress of typical deep learning models, including self-built CNN, transfer learning(TL) and
encoder-decoder(ED), which can be easily deployed on embedded platform, were reviewed. The benchmark
test shows that: 1) It has been able to realize real-time pixel-level crack identification on embedded
platform: the entire crack detection average time cost of an image sample is less than 100ms, either
using the ED method (i.e., FPCNet) or the TL method based on InceptionV3. It can be reduced to less
than 10ms with TL method based on MobileNet (a lightweight backbone base network). 2) In terms of
accuracy, it can reach over 99.8% on CCIC which is easily identified by human eyes. On SDNET2018,
some samples of which are difficult to be identified, FPCNet can reach 97.5%, while TL method is close
to 96.1%. To the best of our knowledge, this paper for the first time comprehensively summarizes
the pavement crack public data sets, and the performance and effectiveness of surface crack detection
and identification deep learning methods for embedded platform, are reviewed and evaluated.

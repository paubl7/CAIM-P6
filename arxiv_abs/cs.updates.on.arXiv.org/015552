As herd size on dairy farms continue to increase, automatic health monitoring of cows has gained
in interest. Lameness, a prevalent health disorder in dairy cows, is commonly detected by analyzing
the gait of cows. A cow's gait can be tracked in videos using pose estimation models because models
learn to automatically localize anatomical landmarks in images and videos. Most animal pose estimation
models are static, that is, videos are processed frame by frame and do not use any temporal information.
In this work, a static deep-learning model for animal-pose-estimation was extended to a temporal
model that includes information from past frames. We compared the performance of the static and
temporal pose estimation models. The data consisted of 1059 samples of 4 consecutive frames extracted
from videos (30 fps) of 30 different dairy cows walking through an outdoor passageway. As farm environments
are prone to occlusions, we tested the robustness of the static and temporal models by adding artificial
occlusions to the videos. The experiments showed that, on non-occluded data, both static and temporal
approaches achieved a Percentage of Correct Keypoints (PCKh@0.2) of 99%. On occluded data, our
temporal approach outperformed the static one by up to 32.9%, suggesting that using temporal data
is beneficial for pose estimation in environments prone to occlusions, such as dairy farms. The
generalization capabilities of the temporal model was evaluated by testing it on data containing
unknown cows (cows not present in the training set). The results showed that the average detection
rate (PCKh@0.2) was of 93.8% on known cows and 87.6% on unknown cows, indicating that the model is
capable of generalizing well to new cows and that they could be easily fine-tuned to new herds. Finally,
we showed that with harder tasks, such as occlusions and unknown cows, a deeper architecture was
more beneficial.

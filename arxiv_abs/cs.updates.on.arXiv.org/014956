Future integrated terrestrial-aerial-satellite networks will have to exhibit some unprecedented
characteristics for the provision of both communications and computation services, and security
for a tremendous number of devices with very broad and demanding requirements across multiple networks,
operators, and ecosystems. Although 3GPP introduced the concept of self-organization networks
(SONs) in 4G and 5G documents to automate network management, even this progressive concept will
face several challenges as it may not be sufficiently agile in coping with the immense levels of complexity,
heterogeneity, and mobility in the envisioned beyond-5G integrated networks. In the presented
vision, we discuss how future integrated networks can be intelligently and autonomously managed
to efficiently utilize resources, reduce operational costs, and achieve the targeted Quality
of Experience (QoE). We introduce the novel concept of "self-evolving networks (SENs)" framework,
which utilizes artificial intelligence, enabled by machine learning (ML) algorithms, to make
future integrated networks fully automated and intelligently evolve with respect to the provision,
adaptation, optimization, and management aspects of networking, communications, computation,
and infrastructure nodes' mobility. To envisage the concept of SEN in future integrated networks,
we use the Intelligent Vertical Heterogeneous Network (I-VHetNet) architecture as our reference.
The paper discusses five prominent scenarios where SEN plays the main role in providing automated
network management. Numerical results provide an insight on how the SEN framework improves the
performance of future integrated networks. The paper presents the leading enablers and examines
the challenges associated with the application of SEN concept in future integrated networks.

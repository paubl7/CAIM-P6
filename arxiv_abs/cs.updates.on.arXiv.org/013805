Graph matching aims to find the latent vertex correspondence between two edge-correlated graphs
and has found numerous applications across different fields. In this paper, we study a seeded graph
matching problem, which assumes that a set of seeds, i.e., pre-mapped vertex-pairs, is given in
advance. While most previous work requires all seeds to be correct, we focus on the setting where
the seeds are partially correct. Specifically, consider two correlated graphs whose edges are
sampled independently from a parent \ER graph $\mathcal{G}(n,p)$. A mapping between the vertices
of the two graphs is provided as seeds, of which an unknown $\beta$ fraction is correct. We first analyze
a simple algorithm that matches vertices based on the number of common seeds in the $1$-hop neighborhoods,
and then further propose a new algorithm that uses seeds in the $2$-hop neighborhoods. We establish
non-asymptotic performance guarantees of perfect matching for both $1$-hop and $2$-hop algorithms,
showing that our new $2$-hop algorithm requires substantially fewer correct seeds than the $1$-hop
algorithm when graphs are sparse. Moreover, by combining our new performance guarantees for the
$1$-hop and $2$-hop algorithms, we attain the best-known results (in terms of the required fraction
of correct seeds) across the entire range of graph sparsity and significantly improve the previous
results in \cite{10.14778/2794367.2794371,lubars2018correcting} when $p\ge n^{-5/6}$. For
instance, when $p$ is a constant or $p=n^{-3/4}$, we show that only $\Omega(\sqrt{n\log n})$ correct
seeds suffice for perfect matching, while the previously best-known results demand $\Omega(n)$
and $\Omega(n^{3/4}\log n)$ correct seeds, respectively. Numerical experiments corroborate
our theoretical findings, demonstrating the superiority of our $2$-hop algorithm on a variety
of synthetic and real graphs.

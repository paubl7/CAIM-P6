Deep neural networks show impressive performance in medical imaging tasks. However, many current
networks generalise poorly to data unseen during training, for example data generated by different
centres. Such behaviour can be caused by networks overfitting easy-to-learn, or statistically
dominant, features while disregarding other potentially informative features. Moreover, dominant
features can lead to learning spurious correlations. For instance, indistinguishable differences
in the sharpness of the images from two different scanners can degrade the performance of the network
significantly. To address these challenges, we evaluate the utility of spectral decoupling in
the context of medical image analysis. Spectral decoupling encourages the neural network to learn
more features by simply regularising the networks' unnormalized prediction scores with an L2 penalty.
Simulation experiments show that spectral decoupling allows training neural networks on datasets
with strong spurious correlations. Networks trained without spectral decoupling do not learn
the original task and appear to make false predictions based on the spurious correlations. Spectral
decoupling also significantly increases networks' robustness for data distribution shifts.
To validate our findings, we train networks with and without spectral decoupling to detect prostate
cancer on haematoxylin and eosin stained whole slide images. The networks are then evaluated with
data scanned in the same centre with two different scanners, and data from a different centre. Networks
trained with spectral decoupling increase the accuracy by 10 percentage points over weight decay
on the dataset from a different centre. Our results show that spectral decoupling allows training
generalisable and robust neural networks to be used across multiple centres, and recommend its
use in future medical imaging tasks.

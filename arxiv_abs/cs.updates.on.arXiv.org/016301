Deep learning based approaches have proven promising to model omics data. However, one of the current
limitations compared to statistical and traditional machine learning approaches is the lack of
explainability, which not only reduces the reliability, but limits the potential for acquiring
novel knowledge from unpicking the "black-box" models. Here we present XOmiVAE, a novel interpretable
deep learning model for cancer classification using high-dimensional omics data. XOmiVAE is able
to obtain contribution values of each gene and latent dimension for a specific prediction, and the
correlation between genes and the latent dimensions. It is also revealed that XOmiVAE can explain
both the supervised classification and the unsupervised clustering results from the deep learning
network. To the best of our knowledge, XOmiVAE is one of the first activated-based deep learning
interpretation method to explain novel clusters generated by variational autoencoders. The results
generated by XOmiVAE were validated by both the biomedical knowledge and the performance of downstream
tasks. XOmiVAE explanations of deep learning based cancer classification and clustering aligned
with current domain knowledge including biological annotation and literature, which shows great
potential for novel biomedical knowledge discovery from deep learning models. The top XOmiVAE
selected genes and dimensions shown significant influence to the performance of cancer classification.
Additionally, we offer important steps to consider when interpreting deep learning models for
tumour classification. For instance, we demonstrate the importance of choosing background samples
that makes biological sense and the limitations of connection weight based methods to explain latent
dimensions.

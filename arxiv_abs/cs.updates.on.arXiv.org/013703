Collaborative filtering (CF) has been one of the most important and popular recommendation methods,
which aims at predicting users' preferences (ratings) based on their past behaviors. Recently,
various types of side information beyond the explicit ratings users give to items, such as social
connections among users and metadata of items, have been introduced into CF and shown to be useful
for improving recommendation performance. However, previous works process different types of
information separately, thus failing to capture the correlations that might exist across them.
To address this problem, in this work, we study the application of heterogeneous information network
(HIN) to enhance CF-based recommendation methods. However, we face challenging issues in HIN-based
recommendation, i.e., how to capture similarities of complex semantics between users and items
in a HIN, and how to effectively fuse these similarities to improve final recommendation performance.
To address these issues, we apply metagraph to similarity computation and solve the information
fusion problem with a ``matrix factorization (MF) + factorization machine (FM)'' framework. For
the MF part, we obtain the user-item similarity matrix from each metagraph and then apply low-rank
matrix approximation to obtain latent features for both users and items. For the FM part, we apply
FM with Group lasso (FMG) on the features obtained from the MF part to train the recommending model
and, at the same time, identify the useful metagraphs. Besides FMG, a two-stage method, we further
propose an end-to-end method, hierarchical attention fusing (HAF), to fuse metagraph based similarities
for the final recommendation. Experimental results on four large real-world datasets show that
the two proposed frameworks significantly outperform existing state-of-the-art methods in terms
of recommendation performance.

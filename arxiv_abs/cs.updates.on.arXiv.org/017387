Pulmonary embolus (PE) refers to obstruction of pulmonary arteries by blood clots. PE accounts
for approximately 100,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. The clinical presentation
of PE is often nonspecific, making the diagnosis challenging. Thus, rapid and accurate risk stratification
is of paramount importance. High-risk PE is caused by right ventricular (RV) dysfunction from acute
pressure overload, which in return can help identify which patients require more aggressive therapy.
Reconstructed four-chamber views of the heart on chest CT can detect right ventricular enlargement.
CT pulmonary angiography (CTPA) is the golden standard in the diagnostic workup of suspected PE.
Therefore, it can link between diagnosis and risk stratification strategies. We developed a weakly
supervised deep learning algorithm, with an emphasis on a novel attention mechanism, to automatically
classify RV strain on CTPA. Our method is a 3D DenseNet model with integrated 3D residual attention
blocks. We evaluated our model on a dataset of CTPAs of emergency department (ED) PE patients. This
model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.88 for classifying
RV strain. The model showed a sensitivity of 87% and specificity of 83.7%. Our solution outperforms
state-of-the-art 3D CNN networks. The proposed design allows for a fully automated network that
can be trained easily in an end-to-end manner without requiring computationally intensive and
time-consuming preprocessing or strenuous labeling of the data.We infer that unmarked CTPAs can
be used for effective RV strain classification. This could be used as a second reader, alerting for
high-risk PE patients. To the best of our knowledge, there are no previous deep learning-based studies
that attempted to solve this problem.

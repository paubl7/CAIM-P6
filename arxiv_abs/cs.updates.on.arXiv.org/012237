To process a large amount of data sequentially and systematically, proper management of workflow
components (i.e., modules, data, configurations, associations among ports and links) in a Scientific
Workflow Management System (SWfMS) is inevitable. Managing data with provenance in a SWfMS to support
reusability of workflows, modules, and data is not a simple task. Handling such components is even
more burdensome for frequently assembled and executed complex workflows for investigating large
datasets with different technologies (i.e., various learning algorithms or models). However,
a great many studies propose various techniques and technologies for managing and recommending
services in a SWfMS, but only a very few studies consider the management of data in a SWfMS for efficient
storing and facilitating workflow executions. Furthermore, there is no study to inquire about
the effectiveness and efficiency of such data management in a SWfMS from a user perspective. In this
paper, we present and evaluate a GUI version of such a novel approach of intermediate data management
with two use cases (Plant Phenotyping and Bioinformatics). The technique we call GUI-RISPTS (Recommending
Intermediate States from Pipelines Considering Tool-States) can facilitate executions of workflows
with processed data (i.e., intermediate outcomes of modules in a workflow) and can thus reduce the
computational time of some modules in a SWfMS. We integrated GUI-RISPTS with an existing workflow
management system called SciWorCS. In SciWorCS, we present an interface that users use for selecting
the recommendation of intermediate states (i.e., modules' outcomes). We investigated GUI-RISP's
effectiveness from users' perspectives along with measuring its overhead in terms of storage and
efficiency in workflow execution.

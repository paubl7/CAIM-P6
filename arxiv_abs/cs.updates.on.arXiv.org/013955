Off-policy reinforcement learning holds the promise of sample-efficient learning of decision-making
policies by leveraging past experience. However, in the offline RL setting -- where a fixed collection
of interactions are provided and no further interactions are allowed -- it has been shown that standard
off-policy RL methods can significantly underperform. Recently proposed methods often aim to
address this shortcoming by constraining learned policies to remain close to the given dataset
of interactions. In this work, we closely investigate an important simplification of BCQ -- a prior
approach for offline RL -- which removes a heuristic design choice and naturally restricts extracted
policies to remain exactly within the support of a given behavior policy. Importantly, in contrast
to their original theoretical considerations, we derive this simplified algorithm through the
introduction of a novel backup operator, Expected-Max Q-Learning (EMaQ), which is more closely
related to the resulting practical algorithm. Specifically, in addition to the distribution support,
EMaQ explicitly considers the number of samples and the proposal distribution, allowing us to derive
new sub-optimality bounds which can serve as a novel measure of complexity for offline RL problems.
In the offline RL setting -- the main focus of this work -- EMaQ matches and outperforms prior state-of-the-art
in the D4RL benchmarks. In the online RL setting, we demonstrate that EMaQ is competitive with Soft
Actor Critic. The key contributions of our empirical findings are demonstrating the importance
of careful generative model design for estimating behavior policies, and an intuitive notion of
complexity for offline RL problems. With its simple interpretation and fewer moving parts, such
as no explicit function approximator representing the policy, EMaQ serves as a strong yet easy to
implement baseline for future work.

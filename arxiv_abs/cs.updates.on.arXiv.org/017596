Flying robots such as the quadrotor could provide an efficient approach for medical treatment or
sensor placing of wild animals. In these applications, continuously targeting the moving animal
is a crucial requirement. Due to the underactuated characteristics of the quadrotor and the coupled
kinematics with the animal, nonlinear optimal tracking approaches, other than smooth feedback
control, are required. However, with severe nonlinearities, it would be time-consuming to evaluate
control inputs, and real-time tracking may not be achieved with generic optimizers onboard. To
tackle this problem, a novel efficient egocentric regulation approach with high computational
efficiency is proposed in this paper. Specifically, it directly formulates the optimal tracking
problem in an egocentric manner regarding the quadrotor's body coordinates. Meanwhile, the nonlinearities
of the system are peeled off through a mapping of the feedback states as well as control inputs, between
the inertial and body coordinates. In this way, the proposed efficient egocentric regulator only
requires solving a quadratic performance objective with linear constraints and then generate
control inputs analytically. Comparative simulations and mimic biological experiment are carried
out to verify the effectiveness and computational efficiency. Results demonstrate that the proposed
control approach presents the highest and stablest computational efficiency than generic optimizers
on different platforms. Particularly, on a commonly utilized onboard computer, our method can
compute the control action in approximately 0.3 ms, which is on the order of 350 times faster than
that of generic nonlinear optimizers, establishing a control frequency around 3000 Hz.

Working with organs and tissue blocks is an essential task in medical environments. In order to prepare
specimens for further analysis, wet-bench workers must dissect tissue and collect spatial metadata.
The Registration User Interface (RUI) was developed to allow stakeholders in the Human Biomolecular
Atlas Program (HuBMAP) to register tissue blocks by size, position, and orientation. The RUI has
been used by tissue mapping centers across the HuBMAP consortium to register a total of 45 kidney,
spleen, and colon tissue blocks. In this paper, we compare three setups for registering one 3D tissue
block object to another 3D reference organ (target) object. The first setup is a 2D Desktop implementation
featuring a traditional screen, mouse, and keyboard interface. The remaining setups are both virtual
reality (VR) versions of the RUI: VR Tabletop, where users sit at a physical desk; VR Standup, where
users stand upright. We ran a user study involving 42 human subjects completing 14 increasingly
difficult and then 30 identical tasks and report position accuracy, rotation accuracy, completion
time, and satisfaction. We found that while VR Tabletop and VR Standup users are about three times
as fast and about a third more accurate in terms of rotation than 2D Desktop users, there are no significant
differences for position accuracy. The performance values for the 2D Desktop version (22.6 seconds
per task, 5.9 degrees rotation, and 1.32 mm position accuracy) confirm that the 2D Desktop interface
is well-suited for registering tissue blocks at a speed and accuracy that meets the needs of experts
performing tissue dissection. In addition, the 2D Desktop setup is cheaper, easier to learn, and
more practical for wet-bench environments than the VR setups. All three setups were implemented
using the Unity game engine, and study materials were made available, alongside videos documenting
our setups.

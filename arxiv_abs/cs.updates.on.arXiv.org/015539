Chest radiography is the most common radiographic examination performed in daily clinical practice
for the detection of various heart and lung abnormalities. The large amount of data to be read and
reported, with more than 100 studies per day for a single radiologist, poses a challenge in consistently
maintaining high interpretation accuracy. The introduction of large-scale public datasets has
led to a series of novel systems for automated abnormality classification. However, the labels
of these datasets were obtained using natural language processed medical reports, yielding a large
degree of label noise that can impact the performance. In this study, we propose novel training strategies
that handle label noise from such suboptimal data. Prior label probabilities were measured on a
subset of training data re-read by 4 board-certified radiologists and were used during training
to increase the robustness of the training model to the label noise. Furthermore, we exploit the
high comorbidity of abnormalities observed in chest radiography and incorporate this information
to further reduce the impact of label noise. Additionally, anatomical knowledge is incorporated
by training the system to predict lung and heart segmentation, as well as spatial knowledge labels.
To deal with multiple datasets and images derived from various scanners that apply different post-processing
techniques, we introduce a novel image normalization strategy. Experiments were performed on
an extensive collection of 297,541 chest radiographs from 86,876 patients, leading to a state-of-the-art
performance level for 17 abnormalities from 2 datasets. With an average AUC score of 0.880 across
all abnormalities, our proposed training strategies can be used to significantly improve performance
scores.

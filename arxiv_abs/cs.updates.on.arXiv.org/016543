In this contribution, we present an extension of the thermodynamic topology optimization that
accounts for a non-linear material behavior due to the evolution of plastic strains. Physically,
a plastic material behavior is characterized by a hysteresis in the stress/strain diagram after
loading and unloading. In contrast, topology optimization is usually employed for a time-invariant
load and the optimized component will only be loaded during physical use. Still, a virtual increase
and decrease of strains, i.e., an unphysical evolution of the strains during the optimization process,
is locally observed due to the evolution of the structure and thus modulation of the stiffness. If
a classical plasticity model is employed for this unphysical ``loading'' and ``unloading'', incorrect
strain and stress states are computed due to the apparent energy dissipation and hysteresis in the
stress/strain diagram. Therefore, this problem is usually resolved by recomputing the physical
behavior for each optimization step: the initial conditions are refreshed by deleting all plastic
strains computed for the previous optimization step. This restores the virgin state for the updated
topology. The plastic strains are subsequently determined by evaluating the classical plasticity
model which requires a discretization of the loading which results in several finite element simulations.
After the correct plastic strains have been found, the next update step for the topology optimization
is performed. To avoid this time-consuming procedure, we develop a novel surrogate material model
that allows to correctly account for the physical state in terms of the plastic strains. Hence, finite
element simulations purely for the plastic material behavior become obsolete such that the optimization
of plastic materials now consumes comparable computation times as the optimization of elastic
materials.

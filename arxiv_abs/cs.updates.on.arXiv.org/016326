Advertisers play an important role in e-commerce platforms, whose advertising expenditures are
the main source of revenue for e-commerce platforms. Therefore, providing advertisers with a better
advertising experience by reducing their cost of trial and error during ad real-time bidding is
crucial to the long-term revenue of e-commerce platforms. To achieve this goal, the advertising
platform needs to understand the advertisers' unique marketing demands and actively recommend
personalized and optimal advertising strategies for them. In this work, we first deploy a prototype
recommender system on Taobao display advertising platform for constant bid and crowd optimization.
Then, we propose a novel recommender system for dynamic bidding strategy recommendation, which
models the advertiser's strategy recommendation problem as a contextual bandit problem. We use
a neural network as the agent to predict the advertisers' demands based on their profile and historical
adoption behaviors. Based on the estimated demand, we apply simulated bidding to derive the optimal
bidding strategy for recommendation and interact with the advertiser by displaying the possible
advertising performance. To solve the exploration/exploitation dilemma, we use Dropout to represent
the uncertainty of the network, which approximately equals to conduct Thompson sampling for efficient
strategy exploration. Online evaluations show that the system can optimize the advertisers' advertising
performance, and advertisers are willing to open the system, select and adopt the suggestions,
which further increases the platform's revenue income. Simulation experiments based on Alibaba
online bidding data prove that the agent can effectively optimize the adoption rate of advertisers,
and Thompson sampling can better balance exploration and exploitation to further optimize the
performance of the model.

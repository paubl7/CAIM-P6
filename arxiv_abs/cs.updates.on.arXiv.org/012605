Mutation and recombination operators play a key role in determining the speed and quality of Genetic
and Evolutionary Algorithms (GEAs). Prior work has analyzed the effects of these operators on genotypic
variation, often using locality metrics that measure the sensitivity and stability of genotype-phenotype
representations to these operators. In this paper, we focus on an important subset of representations,
namely nonredundant bitstring-to-integer representations, and analyze them through the lens
of Rothlauf's widely used locality metrics. We first define locality metrics equivalent to Rothlauf's
that are tailored to our domain: the \textit{point locality} for single-bit mutation and \textit{general
locality} for recombination. With these definitions, we derive tight bounds and a closed form expected
value for point locality. For general locality we show that it is asymptotically equivalent across
all representations and operators. We also recreate three established GEA experiments to understand
the predictive power of point locality on GEA performance, focusing on two popular and often juxtaposed
representations: standard binary and binary reflected Gray. We show that standard binary has provably
no worse locality than any Gray encoding, including binary reflected Gray. We discuss this result
in the context of previous studies that found binary reflected Gray to outperform standard binary,
and we argue that locality cannot be the explanation for strong performance. Finally, we provide
empirical evidence that weak point locality representations can be beneficial to performance
in the exploration phase of the GEA, while strong point locality representations are more beneficial
in the exploitation phase.

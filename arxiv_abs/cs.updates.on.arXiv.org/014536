Byzantine agreement (BA), the task of $n$ parties to agree on one of their input bits in the face of
malicious agents, is a powerful primitive that lies at the core of a vast range of distributed protocols.
Interestingly, in protocols with the best overall communication, the demands of the parties are
highly unbalanced: the amortized cost is $\tilde O(1)$ bits per party, but some parties must send
$\Omega(n)$ bits. In best known balanced protocols, the overall communication is sub-optimal,
with each party communicating $\tilde O(\sqrt{n})$. In this work, we ask whether asymmetry is inherent
for optimizing total communication. Our contributions in this line are as follows: 1) We define
a cryptographic primitive, succinctly reconstructed distributed signatures (SRDS), that suffices
for constructing $\tilde O(1)$ balanced BA. We provide two constructions of SRDS from different
cryptographic and Public-Key Infrastructure (PKI) assumptions. 2) The SRDS-based BA follows
a paradigm of boosting from "almost-everywhere" agreement to full agreement, and does so in a single
round. We prove that PKI setup and cryptographic assumptions are necessary for such protocols in
which every party sends $o(n)$ messages. 3) We further explore connections between a natural approach
toward attaining SRDS and average-case succinct non-interactive argument systems (SNARGs) for
a particular type of NP-Complete problems (generalizing Subset-Sum and Subset-Product). Our
results provide new approaches forward, as well as limitations and barriers, towards minimizing
per-party communication of BA. In particular, we construct the first two BA protocols with $\tilde
O(1)$ balanced communication, offering a tradeoff between setup and cryptographic assumptions,
and answering an open question presented by King and Saia (DISC'09).

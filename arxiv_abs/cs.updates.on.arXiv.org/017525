We consider the corner-stone broadcast task with an adaptive adversary that controls a fixed number
of $t$ edges in the input communication graph. In this model, the adversary sees the entire communication
in the network and the random coins of the nodes, while maliciously manipulating the messages sent
through a set of $t$ edges (unknown to the nodes). Since the influential work of [Pease, Shostak and
Lamport, JACM'80], broadcast algorithms against plentiful adversarial models have been studied
in both theory and practice for over more than four decades. Despite this extensive research, there
is no round efficient broadcast algorithm for general graphs in the CONGEST model of distributed
computing. We provide the first round-efficient broadcast algorithms against adaptive edge adversaries.
Our two key results for $n$-node graphs of diameter $D$ are as follows: 1. For $t=1$, there is a deterministic
algorithm that solves the problem within $\widetilde{O}(D^2)$ rounds, provided that the graph
is 3 edge-connected. This round complexity beats the natural barrier of $O(D^3)$ rounds, the existential
lower bound on the maximal length of $3$ edge-disjoint paths between a given pair of nodes in $G$.
This algorithm can be extended to a $\widetilde{O}(D^{O(t)})$-round algorithm against $t$ adversarial
edges in $(2t+1)$ edge-connected graphs. 2. For expander graphs with edge connectivity of $\Omega(t^2\log
n)$, there is an improved broadcast algorithm with $O(t \log ^2 n)$ rounds against $t$ adversarial
edges. This algorithm exploits the connectivity and conductance properties of G-subgraphs obtained
by employing the Karger's edge sampling technique. Our algorithms mark a new connection between
the areas of fault-tolerant network design and reliable distributed communication.

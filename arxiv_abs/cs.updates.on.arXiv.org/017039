Understanding the spread of false or dangerous beliefs - so-called mis/disinformation - through
a population has never seemed so urgent to many. Network science researchers have often taken a page
from epidemiologists, and modeled the spread of false beliefs as similar to how a disease spreads
through a social network. However, absent from those disease-inspired models is an internal model
of an individual's set of current beliefs, where cognitive science has increasingly documented
how the interaction between mental models and incoming messages seems to be crucially important
for their adoption or rejection. We introduce a cognitive contagion model that combines a network
science approach with an internal cognitive model of the individual agents, affecting what they
believe, and what they pass on. We show that the model, even with a very discrete and simplistic belief
function to capture cognitive dissonance, both adds expressive power over existing disease-based
contagion models, and qualitatively demonstrates the appropriate belief update phenomena at
the individual level. Moreover, we situate our cognitive contagion model in a larger public opinion
diffusion model, which attempts to capture the role of institutions or media sources in belief diffusion
- something that is often left out. We conduct an analysis of the POD model with our simple cognitive
dissonance-sensitive update function across various graph topologies and institutional messaging
patterns. We demonstrate that population-level aggregate outcomes of the model qualitatively
match what has been reported in COVID misinformation public opinion polls. The overall model sets
up a preliminary framework with which social science misinformation researchers and computational
opinion diffusion modelers can join forces to understand, and hopefully learn how to best counter,
the spread of misinformation and "alternative facts."

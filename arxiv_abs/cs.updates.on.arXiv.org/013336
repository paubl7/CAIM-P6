The present review of bibliometric counting methods investigates 1) the number of unique counting
methods in the bibliometric research literature, 2) to what extent the counting methods can be categorized
according to selected characteristics of the counting methods, 3) methods and elements to assess
the internal validity of the counting methods, and 4) to what extent and with which characteristics
the counting methods are used in research evaluations. The review identifies 32 counting methods
introduced during the period 1981 - 2018. Two frameworks categorize these counting methods. Framework
1 describes selected mathematical properties of counting methods, and Framework 2 describes arguments
for choosing a counting method. Twenty of the 32 counting methods are rank-dependent, fractionalized,
and introduced to measure contribution, participation, etc. of an object of study. Next, three
criteria for internal validity are used to identify five methods that test the adequacy of counting
methods, two elements that test sensitivity, and three elements that test homogeneity of the counting
methods. These methods and elements may be used to assess the internal validity of counting methods.
Finally, a literature search finds research evaluations that use the counting methods. Only three
of the 32 counting methods are used by four research evaluations or more. Of these three counting
methods, two are used with the same characteristics as defined in the studies that introduced the
counting methods. The review provides practitioners in research evaluation and researchers in
bibliometrics with a detailed foundation for working with counting methods. At the same time, many
of the findings in the review provide bases for future investigations of counting methods.

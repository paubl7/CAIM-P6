Due to the spontaneous nature of resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) signals, cross-subject comparison
and therefore, group studies of rs-fMRI are challenging. Most existing group comparison methods
use features extracted from the fMRI time series, such as connectivity features, independent component
analysis (ICA), and functional connectivity density (FCD) methods. However, in group studies,
especially in the case of spectrum disorders, distances to a single atlas or a representative subject
do not fully reflect the differences between subjects that may lie on a multi-dimensional spectrum.
Moreover, there may not exist an individual subject or even an average atlas in such cases that is
representative of all subjects. Here we describe an approach that measures pairwise distances
between the synchronized rs-fMRI signals of pairs of subjects instead of to a single reference point.
We also present a method for fMRI data comparison that leverages this generated pairwise feature
to establish a radial basis function kernel matrix. This kernel matrix is used in turn to perform
kernel regression of rs-fMRI to a clinical variable such as a cognitive or neurophysiological performance
score of interest. This method opens a new pointwise analysis paradigm for fMRI data. We demonstrate
the application of this method by performing a pointwise analysis on the cortical surface using
rs-fMRI data to identify cortical regions associated with variability in ADHD index. While pointwise
analysis methods are common in anatomical studies such as cortical thickness analysis and voxel-
and tensor-based morphometry and its variants, such a method is lacking for rs-fMRI and could improve
the utility of rs-fMRI for group studies. The method presented in this paper is aimed at filling this
gap.

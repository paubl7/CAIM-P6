This study investigated the neural dynamics associated with short-term exposure to different
virtual classroom designs with different window placement and room dimension. Participants engaged
in five brief cognitive tasks in each design condition including the Stroop Test, the Digit Span
Test, the Benton Test, a Visual Memory Test, and an Arithmetic Test. Performance on the cognitive
tests and Electroencephalogram (EEG) data were analyzed by contrasting various classroom design
conditions. The cognitive-test-performance results showed no significant differences related
to the architectural design features studied. We computed frequency band-power and connectivity
EEG features to identify neural patterns associated to environmental conditions. A leave one out
machine learning classification scheme was implemented to assess the robustness of the EEG features,
with the classification accuracy evaluation of the trained model repeatedly performed against
an unseen participant's data. The classification results located consistent differences in the
EEG features across participants in the different classroom design conditions, with a predictive
power that was significantly higher compared to a baseline classification learning outcome using
scrambled data. These findings were most robust during the Visual Memory Test, and were not found
during the Stroop Test and the Arithmetic Test. The most discriminative EEG features were observed
in bilateral occipital, parietal, and frontal regions in the theta and alpha frequency bands. While
the implications of these findings for student learning are yet to be determined, this study provides
rigorous evidence that brain activity features during cognitive tasks are affected by the design
elements of window placement and room dimensions.

Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the deadliest types of skin cancer. Analysing dermatoscopic images
plays an important role in the early detection of MM and other pigmented skin lesions. Among different
computer-based methods, deep learning-based approaches and in particular convolutional neural
networks have shown excellent classification and segmentation performances for dermatoscopic
skin lesion images. These models can be trained end-to-end without requiring any hand-crafted
features. However, the effect of using lesion segmentation information on classification performance
has remained an open question. In this study, we explicitly investigated the impact of using skin
lesion segmentation masks on the performance of dermatoscopic image classification. To do this,
first, we developed a baseline classifier as the reference model without using any segmentation
masks. Then, we used either manually or automatically created segmentation masks in both training
and test phases in different scenarios and investigated the classification performances. Evaluated
on the ISIC 2017 challenge dataset which contained two binary classification tasks (i.e. MM vs.
all and seborrheic keratosis (SK) vs. all) and based on the derived area under the receiver operating
characteristic curve scores, we observed four main outcomes. Our results show that 1) using segmentation
masks did not significantly improve the MM classification performance in any scenario, 2) in one
of the scenarios (using segmentation masks for dilated cropping), SK classification performance
was significantly improved, 3) removing all background information by the segmentation masks
significantly degraded the overall classification performance, and 4) in case of using the appropriate
scenario (using segmentation for dilated cropping), there is no significant difference of using
manually or automatically created segmentation masks.

Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) is a non-invasive and non-contacting imaging
technique providing visualization of microvasculature of retina and optic nerve head in human
eyes in vivo. The adequate image quality of OCTA is the prerequisite for the subsequent quantification
of retinal microvasculature. Traditionally, the image quality score based on signal strength
is used for discriminating low quality. However, it is insufficient for identifying artefacts
such as motion and off-centration, which rely specialized knowledge and need tedious and time-consuming
manual identification. One of the most primary issues in OCTA analysis is to sort out the foveal avascular
zone (FAZ) region in the retina, which highly correlates with any visual acuity disease. However,
the variations in OCTA visual quality affect the performance of deep learning in any downstream
marginally. Moreover, filtering the low-quality OCTA images out is both labor-intensive and time-consuming.
To address these issues, we develop an automated computer-aided OCTA image processing system using
deep neural networks as the classifier and segmentor to help ophthalmologists in clinical diagnosis
and research. This system can be an assistive tool as it can process OCTA images of different formats
to assess the quality and segment the FAZ area. The source code is freely available at https://github.com/shanzha09/COIPS.git.
Another major contribution is the large-scale OCTA dataset, namely OCTA-25K-IQA-SEG we publicize
for performance evaluation. It is comprised of four subsets, namely sOCTA-3$\times$3-10k, sOCTA-6$\times$6-14k,
sOCTA-3$\times$3-1.1k-seg, and dOCTA-6$\times$6-1.1k-seg, which contains a total number of
25,665 images. The large-scale OCTA dataset is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.5111975,

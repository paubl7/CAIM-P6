Volunteer crowdsourcing platforms match volunteers with tasks which are often recurring. To ensure
completion of such tasks, platforms frequently use a lever known as "adoption," which amounts to
a commitment by the volunteer to repeatedly perform the task. Despite reducing match uncertainty,
high levels of adoption can decrease the probability of forming new matches, which in turn can suppress
growth. We study how platforms should manage this trade-off. Our research is motivated by a collaboration
with Food Rescue U.S. (FRUS), a volunteer-based food recovery organization active in over 30 locations.
For platforms such as FRUS, success crucially depends on volunteer engagement. Consequently,
effectively utilizing non-monetary levers, such as adoption, is critical. Motivated by the volunteer
management literature and our analysis of FRUS data, we develop a model for two-sided markets which
repeatedly match volunteers with tasks. Our model incorporates match uncertainty as well as the
negative impact of failing to match on future engagement. We study the platform's optimal policy
for setting the adoption level to maximize the total discounted number of matches. We fully characterize
the optimal myopic policy and show that it takes a simple form: depending on volunteer characteristics
and market thickness, either allow for full adoption or disallow adoption. In the long run, we show
that such a policy is either optimal or achieves a constant-factor approximation. Our finding is
robust to incorporating heterogeneity in volunteer behavior. Our work sheds light on how two-sided
platforms need to carefully control the double-edged impacts that commitment levers have on growth
and engagement. A one-size-fits-all solution may not be effective, as the optimal design crucially
depends on the characteristics of the volunteer population.

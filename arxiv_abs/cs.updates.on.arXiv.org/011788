The motivation of our work is to present a new visualization-guided computing paradigm to combine
direct 3D volume processing and volume rendered clues for effective 3D exploration such as extracting
and visualizing microstructures in-vivo. However, it is still challenging to extract and visualize
high fidelity 3D vessel structure due to its high sparseness, noisiness, and complex topology variations.
In this paper, we present an end-to-end deep learning method, VC-Net, for robust extraction of 3D
microvasculature through embedding the image composition, generated by maximum intensity projection
(MIP), into 3D volume image learning to enhance the performance. The core novelty is to automatically
leverage the volume visualization technique (MIP) to enhance the 3D data exploration at deep learning
level. The MIP embedding features can enhance the local vessel signal and are adaptive to the geometric
variability and scalability of vessels, which is crucial in microvascular tracking. A multi-stream
convolutional neural network is proposed to learn the 3D volume and 2D MIP features respectively
and then explore their inter-dependencies in a joint volume-composition embedding space by unprojecting
the MIP features into 3D volume embedding space. The proposed framework can better capture small
/ micro vessels and improve vessel connectivity. To our knowledge, this is the first deep learning
framework to construct a joint convolutional embedding space, where the computed vessel probabilities
from volume rendering based 2D projection and 3D volume can be explored and integrated synergistically.
Experimental results are compared with the traditional 3D vessel segmentation methods and the
deep learning state-of-the-art on public and real patient (micro-)cerebrovascular image datasets.
Our method demonstrates the potential in a powerful MR arteriogram and venogram diagnosis of vascular
diseases.

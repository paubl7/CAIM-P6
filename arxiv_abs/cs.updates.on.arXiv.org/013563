Purpose: To apply a convolutional neural network (CNN) to develop a system that segments intensity
calibration phantom regions in computed tomography (CT) images, and to test the system in a large
cohort to evaluate its robustness. Methods: A total of 1040 cases (520 cases each from two institutions),
in which an intensity calibration phantom (B-MAS200, Kyoto Kagaku, Kyoto, Japan) was used, were
included herein. A training dataset was created by manually segmenting the regions of the phantom
for 40 cases (20 cases each). Segmentation accuracy of the CNN model was assessed with the Dice coefficient
and the average symmetric surface distance (ASD) through the 4-fold cross validation. Further,
absolute differences of radiodensity values (in Hounsfield units: HU) were compared between manually
segmented regions and automatically segmented regions. The system was tested on the remaining
1000 cases. For each institution, linear regression was applied to calculate coefficients for
the correlation between radiodensity and the densities of the phantom. Results: After training,
the median Dice coefficient was 0.977, and the median ASD was 0.116 mm. When segmented regions were
compared between manual segmentation and automated segmentation, the median absolute difference
was 0.114 HU. For the test cases, the median correlation coefficient was 0.9998 for one institution
and was 0.9999 for the other, with a minimum value of 0.9863. Conclusions: The CNN model successfully
segmented the calibration phantom's regions in the CT images with excellent accuracy, and the automated
method was found to be at least equivalent to the conventional manual method. Future study should
integrate the system by automatically segmenting the region of interest in bones such that the bone
mineral density can be fully automatically quantified from CT images.

In this paper, we present a dynamic, demand aware, and pricing-based matching and route planning
framework that allows efficient pooling of multiple passengers and goods in each vehicle. This
approach includes the flexibility for transferring goods through multiple hops from source to
destination as well as pooling of passengers. The key components of the proposed approach include
(i) Pricing by the vehicles to passengers which is based on the insertion cost, which determines
the matching based on passenger's acceptance/rejection, (ii) Matching of goods to vehicles, and
the multi-hop routing of goods, (iii) Route planning of the vehicles to pick. up and drop passengers
and goods, (i) Dispatching idle vehicles to areas of anticipated high passenger and goods demand
using Deep Reinforcement Learning, and (v) Allowing for distributed inference at each vehicle
while collectively optimizing fleet objectives. Our proposed framework can be deployed independently
within each vehicle as this minimizes computational costs associated with the gorwth of distributed
systems and democratizes decision-making to each individual. The proposed framework is validated
in a simulated environment, where we leverage realistic delivery datasets such as the New York City
Taxi public dataset and Google Maps traffic data from delivery offering businesses.Simulations
on a variety of vehicle types, goods, and passenger utility functions show the effectiveness of
our approach as compared to baselines that do not consider combined load transportation or dynamic
multi-hop route planning. Our proposed method showed improvements over the next best baseline
in various aspects including a 15% increase in fleet utilization and 20% increase in average vehicle
profits.

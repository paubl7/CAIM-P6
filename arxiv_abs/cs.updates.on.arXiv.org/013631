The Mumbai Suburban Railways, \emph{locals}, are a key transit infrastructure of the city and is
crucial for resuming normal economic activity. To reduce disease transmission, policymakers
can enforce reduced crowding and mandate wearing of masks. \emph{Cohorting} -- forming groups
of travelers that always travel together, is an additional policy to reduce disease transmission
on \textit{locals} without severe restrictions. Cohorting allows us to: ($i$) form traveler bubbles,
thereby decreasing the number of distinct interactions over time; ($ii$) potentially quarantine
an entire cohort if a single case is detected, making contact tracing more efficient, and ($iii$)
target cohorts for testing and early detection of symptomatic as well as asymptomatic cases. Studying
impact of cohorts using compartmental models is challenging because of the ensuing representational
complexity. Agent-based models provide a natural way to represent cohorts along with the representation
of the cohort members with the larger social network. This paper describes a novel multi-scale agent-based
model to study the impact of cohorting strategies on COVID-19 dynamics in Mumbai. We achieve this
by modeling the Mumbai urban region using a detailed agent-based model comprising of 12.4 million
agents. Individual cohorts and their inter-cohort interactions as they travel on locals are modeled
using local mean field approximations. The resulting multi-scale model in conjunction with a detailed
disease transmission and intervention simulator is used to assess various cohorting strategies.
The results provide a quantitative trade-off between cohort size and its impact on disease dynamics
and well being. The results show that cohorts can provide significant benefit in terms of reduced
transmission without significantly impacting ridership and or economic \& social activity.

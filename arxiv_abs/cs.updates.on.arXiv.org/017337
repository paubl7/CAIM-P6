Codification of free-text clinical narratives have long been recognised to be beneficial for secondary
uses such as funding, insurance claim processing and research. The current scenario of assigning
codes is a manual process which is very expensive, time-consuming and error prone. In recent years,
many researchers have studied the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP), related Machine Learning
(ML) and Deep Learning (DL) methods and techniques to resolve the problem of manual coding of clinical
narratives and to assist human coders to assign clinical codes more accurately and efficiently.
This systematic literature review provides a comprehensive overview of automated clinical coding
systems that utilises appropriate NLP, ML and DL methods and techniques to assign ICD codes to discharge
summaries. We have followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses(PRISMA)
guidelines and conducted a comprehensive search of publications from January, 2010 to December
2020 in four academic databases- PubMed, ScienceDirect, Association for Computing Machinery(ACM)
Digital Library, and the Association for Computational Linguistics(ACL) Anthology. We reviewed
7,556 publications; 38 met the inclusion criteria. This review identified: datasets having discharge
summaries; NLP techniques along with some other data extraction processes, different feature
extraction and embedding techniques. To measure the performance of classification methods, different
evaluation metrics are used. Lastly, future research directions are provided to scholars who are
interested in automated ICD code assignment. Efforts are still required to improve ICD code prediction
accuracy, availability of large-scale de-identified clinical corpora with the latest version
of the classification system. This can be a platform to guide and share knowledge with the less experienced
coders and researchers.

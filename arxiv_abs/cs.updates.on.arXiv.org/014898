We present online algorithms for directed spanners and directed Steiner forests. These problems
fall under the unifying framework of online covering linear programming formulations, developed
by Buchbinder and Naor (MOR, 34, 2009), based on primal-dual techniques. Our results include the
following: For the pairwise spanner problem, in which the pairs of vertices to be spanned arrive
online, we present an efficient randomized $\tilde{O}(n^{4/5})$-competitive algorithm for
graphs with general lengths, where $n$ is the number of vertices of the given graph. For graphs with
uniform lengths, we give an efficient randomized $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3+\epsilon})$-competitive
algorithm, and an efficient deterministic $\tilde{O}(k^{1/2+\epsilon})$-competitive algorithm,
where $k$ is the number of terminal pairs. These are the first online algorithms for directed spanners.
For the directed Steiner forest problem with uniform costs, in which the pairs of vertices to be connected
arrive online, we present an efficient randomized $\tilde{O}(n^{2/3 + \epsilon})$-competitive
algorithm. The state-of-the-art online algorithm for general costs is due to Chakrabarty, Ene,
Krishnaswamy, and Panigrahi (SICOMP 2018) and is $\tilde{O}(k^{1/2 + \epsilon})$-competitive.
In the offline setting, the current best approximation ratio for pairwise spanners with uniform
lengths and directed Steiner forests with uniform costs are both $\tilde{O}(n^{3/5 + \epsilon})$,
due to Chlamtac, Dinitz, Kortsarz, and Laekhanukit (TALG 2020). We observe that a small modification
of the online covering framework by Buchbinder and Naor implies a polynomial-time primal-dual
approach with separation oracles, which a priori might perform exponentially many calls to the
oracle. We convert the online spanner problem and the online Steiner forest problem into online
covering problems and round in a problem-specific fashion.

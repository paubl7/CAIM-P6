Objective: To introduce a method for tracking results and utilization of Artificial Intelligence
(tru-AI) in radiology. By tracking both large-scale utilization and AI results data, the tru-AI
approach is designed to calculate surrogates for measuring important disease-related observational
quantities over time, such as the prevalence of intracranial hemorrhage during the COVID-19 pandemic
outbreak. Methods: To quantitatively investigate the clinical applicability of the tru-AI approach,
we analyzed service requests for automatically identifying intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) on
head CT using a commercial AI solution. This software is typically used for AI-based prioritization
of radiologists' reading lists for reducing turnaround times in patients with emergent clinical
findings, such as ICH or pulmonary embolism.We analyzed data of N=9,421 emergency-setting non-contrast
head CT studies at a major US healthcare system acquired from November 1, 2019 through June 2, 2020,
and compared two observation periods, namely (i) a pre-pandemic epoch from November 1, 2019 through
February 29, 2020, and (ii) a period during the COVID-19 pandemic outbreak, April 1-30, 2020. Results:
Although daily CT scan counts were significantly lower during (40.1 +/- 7.9) than before (44.4 +/-
7.6) the COVID-19 outbreak, we found that ICH was more likely to be observed by AI during than before
the COVID-19 outbreak (p<0.05), with approximately one daily ICH+ case more than statistically
expected. Conclusion: Our results suggest that, by tracking both large-scale utilization and
AI results data in radiology, the tru-AI approach can contribute clinical value as a versatile exploratory
tool, aiming at a better understanding of pandemic-related effects on healthcare.

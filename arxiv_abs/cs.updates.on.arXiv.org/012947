The task of redescription mining explores ways to re-describe different subsets of entities contained
in a dataset and to reveal non-trivial associations between different subsets of attributes, called
views. This interesting and challenging task is encountered in different scientific fields, and
is addressed by a number of approaches that obtain redescriptions and allow for the exploration
and analyses of attribute associations. The main limitation of existing approaches to this task
is their inability to use more than two views. Our work alleviates this drawback. We present a memory
efficient, extensible multi-view redescription mining framework that can be used to relate multiple,
i.e. more than two views, disjoint sets of attributes describing one set of entities. The framework
can use any multi-target regression or multi-label classification algorithm, with models that
can be represented as sets of rules, to generate redescriptions. Multi-view redescriptions are
built using incremental view-extending heuristic from initially created two-view redescriptions.
In this work, we use different types of Predictive Clustering trees algorithms (regular, extra,
with random output selection) and the Random Forest thereof in order to improve the quality of final
redescription sets and/or execution time needed to generate them. We provide multiple performance
analyses of the proposed framework and compare it against the naive approach to multi-view redescription
mining. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed multi-view extension on several datasets,
including a use-case on understanding of machine learning models - a topic of growing importance
in machine learning and artificial intelligence in general.

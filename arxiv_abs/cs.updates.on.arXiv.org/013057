Count-sketch is a popular matrix sketching algorithm that can produce a sketch of an input data matrix
X in O(nnz(X))time where nnz(X) denotes the number of non-zero entries in X. The sketched matrix
will be much smaller than X while preserving most of its properties. Therefore, count-sketch is
widely used for addressing high-dimensionality challenge in machine learning. However, there
are two main limitations of count-sketch: (1) The sketching matrix used count-sketch is generated
randomly which does not consider any intrinsic data properties of X. This data-oblivious matrix
sketching method could produce a bad sketched matrix which will result in low accuracy for subsequent
machine learning tasks (e.g.classification); (2) For highly sparse input data, count-sketch
could produce a dense sketched data matrix. This dense sketch matrix could make the subsequent machine
learning tasks more computationally expensive than on the original sparse data X. To address these
two limitations, we first show an interesting connection between count-sketch and k-means clustering
by analyzing the reconstruction error of the count-sketch method. Based on our analysis, we propose
to reduce the reconstruction error of count-sketch by using k-means clustering algorithm to obtain
the low-dimensional sketched matrix. In addition, we propose to solve k-mean clustering using
gradient descent with -L1 ball projection to produce a sparse sketched matrix. Our experimental
results based on six real-life classification datasets have demonstrated that our proposed method
achieves higher accuracy than the original count-sketch and other popular matrix sketching algorithms.
Our results also demonstrate that our method produces a sparser sketched data matrix than other
methods and therefore the prediction cost of our method will be smaller than other matrix sketching
methods.

Astounding results from Transformer models on natural language tasks have intrigued the vision
community to study their application to computer vision problems. Among their salient benefits,
Transformers enable modeling long dependencies between input sequence elements and support parallel
processing of sequence as compared to recurrent networks e.g., Long short-term memory (LSTM).
Different from convolutional networks, Transformers require minimal inductive biases for their
design and are naturally suited as set-functions. Furthermore, the straightforward design of
Transformers allows processing multiple modalities (e.g., images, videos, text and speech) using
similar processing blocks and demonstrates excellent scalability to very large capacity networks
and huge datasets. These strengths have led to exciting progress on a number of vision tasks using
Transformer networks. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the Transformer
models in the computer vision discipline. We start with an introduction to fundamental concepts
behind the success of Transformers i.e., self-attention, large-scale pre-training, and bidirectional
encoding. We then cover extensive applications of transformers in vision including popular recognition
tasks (e.g., image classification, object detection, action recognition, and segmentation),
generative modeling, multi-modal tasks (e.g., visual-question answering, visual reasoning,
and visual grounding), video processing (e.g., activity recognition, video forecasting), low-level
vision (e.g., image super-resolution, image enhancement, and colorization) and 3D analysis (e.g.,
point cloud classification and segmentation). We compare the respective advantages and limitations
of popular techniques both in terms of architectural design and their experimental value. Finally,
we provide an analysis on open research directions and possible future works.

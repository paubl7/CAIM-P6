Objective Reticular pseudodrusen (RPD), a key feature of age-related macular degeneration (AMD),
are poorly detected by human experts on standard color fundus photography (CFP) and typically require
advanced imaging modalities such as fundus autofluorescence (FAF). The objective was to develop
and evaluate the performance of a novel 'M3' deep learning framework on RPD detection. Materials
and Methods A deep learning framework M3 was developed to detect RPD presence accurately using CFP
alone, FAF alone, or both, employing >8000 CFP-FAF image pairs obtained prospectively (Age-Related
Eye Disease Study 2). The M3 framework includes multi-modal (detection from single or multiple
image modalities), multi-task (training different tasks simultaneously to improve generalizability),
and multi-attention (improving ensembled feature representation) operation. Performance on
RPD detection was compared with state-of-the-art deep learning models and 13 ophthalmologists;
performance on detection of two other AMD features (geographic atrophy and pigmentary abnormalities)
was also evaluated. Results For RPD detection, M3 achieved area under receiver operating characteristic
(AUROC) 0.832, 0.931, and 0.933 for CFP alone, FAF alone, and both, respectively. M3 performance
on CFP was very substantially superior to human retinal specialists (median F1-score 0.644 versus
0.350). External validation (on Rotterdam Study, Netherlands) demonstrated high accuracy on
CFP alone (AUROC 0.965). The M3 framework also accurately detected geographic atrophy and pigmentary
abnormalities (AUROC 0.909 and 0.912, respectively), demonstrating its generalizability. Conclusion
This study demonstrates the successful development, robust evaluation, and external validation
of a novel deep learning framework that enables accessible, accurate, and automated AMD diagnosis
and prognosis.

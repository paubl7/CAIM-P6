Recent researches show that deep learning model is susceptible to backdoor attacks. Many defenses
against backdoor attacks have been proposed. However, existing defense works require high computational
overhead or backdoor attack information such as the trigger size, which is difficult to satisfy
in realistic scenarios. In this paper, a novel backdoor detection method based on adversarial examples
is proposed. The proposed method leverages intentional adversarial perturbations to detect whether
an image contains a trigger, which can be applied in both the training stage and the inference stage
(sanitize the training set in training stage and detect the backdoor instances in inference stage).
Specifically, given an untrusted image, the adversarial perturbation is added to the image intentionally.
If the prediction of the model on the perturbed image is consistent with that on the unperturbed image,
the input image will be considered as a backdoor instance. Compared with most existing defense works,
the proposed adversarial perturbation based method requires low computational resources and
maintains the visual quality of the images. Experimental results show that, the backdoor detection
rate of the proposed defense method is 99.63%, 99.76% and 99.91% on Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10 and
GTSRB datasets, respectively. Besides, the proposed method maintains the visual quality of the
image as the l2 norm of the added perturbation are as low as 2.8715, 3.0513 and 2.4362 on Fashion-MNIST,
CIFAR-10 and GTSRB datasets, respectively. In addition, it is also demonstrated that the proposed
method can achieve high defense performance against backdoor attacks under different attack settings
(trigger transparency, trigger size and trigger pattern). Compared with the existing defense
work (STRIP), the proposed method has better detection performance on all the three datasets, and
is more efficient than STRIP.

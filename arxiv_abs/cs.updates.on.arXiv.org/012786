Multiple groupcasting over the broadcast channel (BC) is studied. In particular, an inner bound
is obtained for the $K$-receiver discrete memoryless (DM) BC for the diamond message set which consists
of four groupcast messages: one desired by all receivers, one by all but two receivers, and two more
desired by all but each one of those two receivers. The inner bound is based on rate-splitting and
superposition coding and is given in explicit form herein as a union over coding distributions of
four-dimensional polytopes. When specialized to the so-called combination network, which is
a class of three-layer (two-hop) broadcast networks parameterized by $2^K-1$ finite-and-arbitrary-capacity
noiseless links from the source node in the first layer to as many nodes of the second layer, our top-down
approach from the DM BC to the combination network yields an explicit inner bound as a single polytope
via the identification of a single coding distribution. This inner bound consists of inequalities
which are then identified to be within the class of a plethora of (indeed, infinitely many) generalized
cut-set outer bounds recently obtained by Salimi et al for broadcast networks. We hence establish
the capacity region of the general $K$-user combination network for the diamond message set, and
do so in explicit form. Such a result implies a certain strength of our inner bound for the DM BC in that
it (a) produces a hitherto unknown capacity region when specialized to the combination network
and (b) may capture many combinatorial aspects of the capacity region of the $K$-receiver DM BC itself
(for the diamond message set). Moreover, we further extend that inner bound by adding binning to
it and providing that inner bound also in explicit form as a union over coding distributions of four-dimensional
polytopes in the message rates.

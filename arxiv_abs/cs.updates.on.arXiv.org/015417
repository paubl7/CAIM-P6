The massive machine-type communications (mMTC) paradigm based on media modulation in conjunction
with massive MIMO base stations (BSs) is emerging as a viable solution to support the massive connectivity
for the future Internet-of-Things, in which the inherent massive access at the BSs poses significant
challenges for device activity and data detection (DADD). This paper considers the DADD problem
for both uncoded and coded media modulation based mMTC with a slotted access frame structure, where
the device activity remains unchanged within one frame. Specifically, due to the slotted access
frame structure and the adopted media modulated symbols, the access signals exhibit a doubly structured
sparsity in both the time domain and the modulation domain. Inspired by this, a doubly structured
approximate message passing (DS-AMP) algorithm is proposed for reliable DADD in the uncoded case.
Also, we derive the state evolution of the DS-AMP algorithm to theoretically characterize its performance.
As for the coded case, we develop a bit-interleaved coded media modulation scheme and propose an
iterative DS-AMP (IDS-AMP) algorithm based on successive inference cancellation (SIC), where
the signal components associated with the detected active devices are successively subtracted
to improve the data decoding performance. In addition, the channel estimation problem for media
modulation based mMTC is discussed and an efficient data-aided channel state information (CSI)
update strategy is developed to reduce the training overhead in block fading channels. Finally,
simulation results and computational complexity analysis verify the superiority of the proposed
algorithms in both uncoded and coded cases. Also, our results verify the validity of the proposed
data-aided CSI update strategy.

Data dependent triangulations are triangulations of point sets in the plane that are computed under
consideration not only of the points' $x$- and $y$-coordinates but also of additional data (e.g.,
elevation). In particular, min-error criteria have been suggested to compute triangulations
that approximate a given surface. In this article, we show how data dependent triangulations with
min-error criteria can be used to reconstruct a dynamic surface over a longer time period if height
values are continuously monitored at a sparse set of stations and, additionally for few epochs or
a single one an accurate reference surface is given. The basic idea is to learn an height-optimal
triangulation based on the available reference data and to use the learned triangulation to compute
piece-wise linear surface models for epochs in which only the observations of the monitoring stations
are given. In addition, we combine our approach of height-optimal triangulation with $k$-order
Delaunay triangulation to stabilize the triangles geometrically. We consider these approaches
particularly useful for reconstructing the historical evolution of a sea surface by combining
tide-gauge measurements with data of modern satellite altimetry. We show how to learn a height-optimal
triangulation and a $k$-order height-optimal triangulation using an exact algorithm based on
integer linear programming and evaluate our approaches both with respect to its running times and
the quality of the reconstructions in contrast to a solution by a Delaunay triangulation which has
earlier been used for sea-surface modeling. For existing data of the North Sea we show that we can
better reconstruct the dynamic sea surface for about 156 months back in time using the height-optimal
triangulation than the Delaunay triangulation and even for about 180 months using the $k$-order
height-optimal triangulation for $k=2$.

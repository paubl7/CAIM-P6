This paper proposes a millimeter wave-NOMA (mmWave-NOMA) system that takes into account the end-user
signal processing capabilities, an important practical consideration. The implementation of
NOMA in the downlink (DL) direction requires successive interference cancellation (SIC) to be
performed at the user terminals, which comes at the cost of additional complexity. In NOMA, the weakest
user only has to decode its own signal, while the strongest user has to decode the signals of all other
users in the SIC procedure. Hence, the additional implementation complexity required of the user
to perform SIC for DL NOMA depends on its position in the SIC decoding order. Beyond fifth-generation
(B5G) communication systems are expected to support a wide variety of end-user devices, each with
their own processing capabilities. We envision a system where users report their SIC decoding capability
to the base station (BS), i.e., the number of other users signals a user is capable of decoding in the
SIC procedure. We investigate the rate maximization problem in such a system, by breaking it down
into a user clustering and ordering problem (UCOP), followed by a power allocation problem. We propose
a NOMA minimum exact cover (NOMA-MEC) heuristic algorithm that converts the UCOP into a cluster
minimization problem from a derived set of valid cluster combinations after factoring in the SIC
decoding capability. The complexity of NOMA-MEC is analyzed for various algorithm and system parameters.
For a homogeneous system of users that all have the same decoding capabilities, we show that this
equates to a simple maximum number of users per cluster constraint and propose a lower complexity
NOMA-best beam (NOMA-BB) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the performance superiority
in terms of sum rate compared to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) and traditional NOMA

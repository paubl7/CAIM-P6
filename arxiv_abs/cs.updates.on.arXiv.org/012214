Various model-based diagnosis scenarios require the computation of most preferred fault explanations.
Existing algorithms that are sound (i.e., output only actual fault explanations) and complete
(i.e., can return all explanations), however, require exponential space to achieve this task.
As a remedy, we propose two novel diagnostic search algorithms, called RBF-HS (Recursive Best-First
Hitting Set Search) and HBF-HS (Hybrid Best-First Hitting Set Search), which build upon tried and
tested techniques from the heuristic search domain. RBF-HS can enumerate an arbitrary predefined
finite number of fault explanations in best-first order within linear space bounds, without sacrificing
the desirable soundness or completeness properties. The idea of HBF-HS is to find a trade-off between
runtime optimization and a restricted space consumption that does not exceed the available memory.
In extensive experiments on real-world diagnosis cases we compared our approaches to Reiter's
HS-Tree, a state-of-the-art method that gives the same theoretical guarantees and is as general(ly
applicable) as the suggested algorithms. For the computation of minimum-cardinality fault explanations,
we find that (1) RBF-HS reduces memory requirements substantially in most cases by up to several
orders of magnitude, (2) in more than a third of the cases, both memory savings and runtime savings
are achieved, and (3) given the runtime overhead is significant, using HBF-HS instead of RBF-HS
reduces the runtime to values comparable with HS-Tree while keeping the used memory reasonably
bounded. When computing most probable fault explanations, we observe that RBF-HS tends to trade
memory savings more or less one-to-one for runtime overheads. Again, HBF-HS proves to be a reasonable
remedy to cut down the runtime while complying with practicable memory bounds.

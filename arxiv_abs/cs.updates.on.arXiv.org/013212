Automatic lung lesions segmentation of chest CT scans is considered a pivotal stage towards accurate
diagnosis and severity measurement of COVID-19. Traditional U-shaped encoder-decoder architecture
and its variants suffer from diminutions of contextual information in pooling/upsampling operations
with increased semantic gaps among encoded and decoded feature maps as well as instigate vanishing
gradient problems for its sequential gradient propagation that result in sub-optimal performance.
Moreover, operating with 3D CT-volume poses further limitations due to the exponential increase
of computational complexity making the optimization difficult. In this paper, an automated COVID-19
lesion segmentation scheme is proposed utilizing a highly efficient neural network architecture,
namely CovSegNet, to overcome these limitations. Additionally, a two-phase training scheme is
introduced where a deeper 2D-network is employed for generating ROI-enhanced CT-volume followed
by a shallower 3D-network for further enhancement with more contextual information without increasing
computational burden. Along with the traditional vertical expansion of Unet, we have introduced
horizontal expansion with multi-stage encoder-decoder modules for achieving optimum performance.
Additionally, multi-scale feature maps are integrated into the scale transition process to overcome
the loss of contextual information. Moreover, a multi-scale fusion module is introduced with a
pyramid fusion scheme to reduce the semantic gaps between subsequent encoder/decoder modules
while facilitating the parallel optimization for efficient gradient propagation. Outstanding
performances have been achieved in three publicly available datasets that largely outperform
other state-of-the-art approaches. The proposed scheme can be easily extended for achieving optimum
segmentation performances in a wide variety of applications.

Under increasing economic and environmental pressure, airlines are constantly seeking new technologies
and optimizing flight operations to reduce fuel consumption. However, the current practice on
fuel loading, which has a significant impact on aircraft weight and fuel consumption, has yet to
be thoroughly addressed by existing studies. Excess fuel is loaded by dispatchers and (or) pilots
to handle fuel consumption uncertainties, primarily caused by flight time uncertainties, which
cannot be predicted by current Flight Planning Systems. In this paper, we develop a novel spatial
weighted recurrent neural network model to provide better flight time predictions by capturing
air traffic information at a national scale based on multiple data sources, including Automatic
Dependent Surveillance-Broadcast, Meteorological Aerodrome Reports, and airline records.
In this model, a spatial weighted layer is designed to extract spatial dependences among network
delay states. Then, a new training procedure associated with the spatial weighted layer is introduced
to extract OD-specific spatial weights. Long short-term memory networks are used to extract the
temporal behavior patterns of network delay states. Finally, features from delays, weather, and
flight schedules are fed into a fully connected neural network to predict the flight time of a particular
flight. The proposed model was evaluated using one year of historical data from an airline's real
operations. Results show that our model can provide more accurate flight time predictions than
baseline methods, especially for flights with extreme delays. We also show that, with the improved
flight time prediction, fuel loading can be optimized and resulting in reduced fuel consumption
by 0.016%-1.915% without increasing the fuel depletion risk.

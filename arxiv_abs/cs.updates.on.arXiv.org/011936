This paper proposes a new approach to sales forecasting for new products with long lead time but short
product life cycle. These SKUs are usually sold for one season only, without any replenishments.
An exponential factorization machine (EFM) sales forecast model is developed to solve this problem
which not only considers SKU attributes, but also pairwise interactions. The EFM model is significantly
different from the original Factorization Machines (FM) from two-fold: (1) the attribute-level
formulation for explanatory variables and (2) exponential formulation for the positive response
variable. The attribute-level formation excludes infeasible intra-attribute interactions
and results in more efficient feature engineering comparing with the conventional one-hot encoding,
while the exponential formulation is demonstrated more effective than the log-transformation
for the positive but not skewed distributed responses. In order to estimate the parameters, percentage
error squares (PES) and error squares (ES) are minimized by a proposed adaptive batch gradient descent
method over the training set. Real-world data provided by a footwear retailer in Singapore is used
for testing the proposed approach. The forecasting performance in terms of both mean absolute percentage
error (MAPE) and mean absolute error (MAE) compares favourably with not only off-the-shelf models
but also results reported by extant sales and demand forecasting studies. The effectiveness of
the proposed approach is also demonstrated by two external public datasets. Moreover, we prove
the theoretical relationships between PES and ES minimization, and present an important property
of the PES minimization for regression models; that it trains models to underestimate data. This
property fits the situation of sales forecasting where unit-holding cost is much greater than the
unit-shortage cost.

Influence maximization problem attempts to find a small subset of nodes that makes the expected
influence spread maximized, which has been researched intensively before. They all assumed that
each user in the seed set we select is activated successfully and then spread the influence. However,
in the real scenario, not all users in the seed set are willing to be an influencer. Based on that, we
consider each user associated with a probability with which we can activate her as a seed, and we can
attempt to activate her many times. In this paper, we study the adaptive influence maximization
with multiple activations (Adaptive-IMMA) problem, where we select a node in each iteration, observe
whether she accepts to be a seed, if yes, wait to observe the influence diffusion process; If no, we
can attempt to activate her again with a higher cost or select another node as a seed. We model the multiple
activations mathematically and define it on the domain of integer lattice. We propose a new concept,
adaptive dr-submodularity, and show our Adaptive-IMMA is the problem that maximizing an adaptive
monotone and dr-submodular function under the expected knapsack constraint. Adaptive dr-submodular
maximization problem is never covered by any existing studies. Thus, we summarize its properties
and study its approximability comprehensively, which is a non-trivial generalization of existing
analysis about adaptive submodularity. Besides, to overcome the difficulty to estimate the expected
influence spread, we combine our adaptive greedy policy with sampling techniques without losing
the approximation ratio but reducing the time complexity. Finally, we conduct experiments on several
real datasets to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed policies.

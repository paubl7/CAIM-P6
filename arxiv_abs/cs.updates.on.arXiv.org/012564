3D free-form surfaces with high aesthetical and functional requirements are widely used in automotive
and aerospace industry. Geometric and dimensional variations of these free-form surfaces caused
by inevitable uncertainties in the manufacturing process often leads to product quality issues.
Failing to model the effect of non-ideal parts, i.e., parts with geometric and dimensional errors,
during design inhibits the ability to predict such quality issues. A major challenge for accurate
modelling of non-ideal parts during early design phase is the limited availability of data and the
ability to effectively utilise the historical data from similar parts. Overcoming this challenge
a novel morphing Gaussian Random Field (mGRF) methodology for shape error modelling of 3D free-form
surfaces during the early design stage is presented in this paper. The mGRF methodology works under
the constraint of limited data availability and can utilise historical measurement data of similar
parts to generate non-ideal parts that exhibit spatial deviation patterns as similar as possible
to the true manufactured part and conform to specified form tolerance requirements for the profile
of a surface. Additionally, the mGRF methodology provides designers with an intuitive way to explore
several `What if?' scenarios relating to part geometric variations during early design phase.
This is achieved by first, modelling the spatial correlation in the deviations of the part from its
design nominal using Gaussian processes and then, utilising the modelled spatial correlations
to generate non-ideal parts by conditional simulations.The developed mGRF methodology is demonstrated,
compared with state-of-art methodologies, and validated using a sport-utility-vehicle door
part.

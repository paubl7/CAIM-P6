Tumor segmentation in oncological PET is challenging, a major reason being the partial-volume
effects due to the low system resolution and finite voxel size. The latter results in tissue-fraction
effects, i.e. voxels contain a mixture of tissue classes. Most conventional methods perform segmentation
by exclusively assigning each voxel in the image as belonging to either the tumor or normal tissue
classes. Thus, these methods are inherently limited in modeling the tissue-fraction effects.
To address this inherent limitation, we propose an estimation-based approach to segmentation.
Specifically, we develop a Bayesian method that estimates the posterior mean of fractional volume
that the tumor occupies within each image voxel. The proposed method, implemented using an encoder-decoder
network, was first evaluated using clinically realistic 2-D simulation studies with known ground
truth, in the context of segmenting the primary tumor in PET images of patients with lung cancer.
The evaluation studies demonstrated that the method accurately estimated the tumor-fraction
areas and significantly outperformed widely used conventional methods, including a U-net-based
method, on the task of segmenting the tumor. In addition, the proposed method was relatively insensitive
to partial-volume effects and yielded reliable tumor segmentation for different clinical-scanner
configurations. The method was then evaluated using clinical images of patients with stage II and
III non-small cell lung cancer from ACRIN 6668/RTOG 0235 multi-center clinical trial. Here, the
results showed that the proposed method significantly outperformed all other considered methods
and yielded accurate tumor segmentation on patient images with dice similarity coefficient of
0.82 (95% CI: 0.78, 0.86). Overall, this study demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed method
to accurately segment tumors in PET images.

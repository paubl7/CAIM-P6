Recent advances in camera equipped drone applications and their widespread use increased the demand
on vision based object detection algorithms for aerial images. Object detection process is inherently
a challenging task as a generic computer vision problem, however, since the use of object detection
algorithms on UAVs (or on drones) is relatively a new area, it remains as a more challenging problem
to detect objects in aerial images. There are several reasons for that including: (i) the lack of
large drone datasets including large object variance, (ii) the large orientation and scale variance
in drone images when compared to the ground images, and (iii) the difference in texture and shape
features between the ground and the aerial images. Deep learning based object detection algorithms
can be classified under two main categories: (a) single-stage detectors and (b) multi-stage detectors.
Both single-stage and multi-stage solutions have their advantages and disadvantages over each
other. However, a technique to combine the good sides of each of those solutions could yield even
a stronger solution than each of those solutions individually. In this paper, we propose an ensemble
network, SyNet, that combines a multi-stage method with a single-stage one with the motivation
of decreasing the high false negative rate of multi-stage detectors and increasing the quality
of the single-stage detector proposals. As building blocks, CenterNet and Cascade R-CNN with pretrained
feature extractors are utilized along with an ensembling strategy. We report the state of the art
results obtained by our proposed solution on two different datasets: namely MS-COCO and visDrone
with \%52.1 $mAP_{IoU = 0.75}$ is obtained on MS-COCO $val2017$ dataset and \%26.2 $mAP_{IoU = 0.75}$
is obtained on VisDrone $test-set$.

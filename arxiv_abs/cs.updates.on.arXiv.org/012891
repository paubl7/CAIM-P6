Discovering the antecedents of individuals' influence in collaborative environments is an important,
practical, and challenging problem. In this paper, we study interpersonal influence in small groups
of individuals who collectively execute a sequence of intellective tasks. We observe that along
an issue sequence with feedback, individuals with higher expertise and social confidence are accorded
higher interpersonal influence. We also observe that low-performing individuals tend to underestimate
their high-performing teammate's expertise. Based on these observations, we introduce three
hypotheses and present empirical and theoretical support for their validity. We report empirical
evidence on longstanding theories of transactive memory systems, social comparison, and confidence
heuristics on the origins of social influence. We propose a cognitive dynamical model inspired
by these theories to describe the process by which individuals adjust interpersonal influences
over time. We demonstrate the model's accuracy in predicting individuals' influence and provide
analytical results on its asymptotic behavior for the case with identically performing individuals.
Lastly, we propose a novel approach using deep neural networks on a pre-trained text embedding model
for predicting the influence of individuals. Using message contents, message times, and individual
correctness collected during tasks, we are able to accurately predict individuals' self-reported
influence over time. Extensive experiments verify the accuracy of the proposed models compared
to baselines such as structural balance and reflected appraisal model. While the neural networks
model is the most accurate, the dynamical model is the most interpretable for influence prediction.

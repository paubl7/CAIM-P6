If two or more identical HTTPS clients, located at different geographic locations (regions), make
an HTTPS request to the same domain (e.g. example.com), on the same day, will they receive the same
HTTPS security guarantees in response? Our results give evidence that this is not always the case.
We conduct scans for the top 250,000 most visited domains on the Internet, from clients located at
five different regions: Australia, Brazil, India, the UK, and the US. Our scans gather data from
both application (URLs and HTTP headers) and transport (servers' selected TLS version, ciphersuite,
and certificate) layers. Overall, we find that HTTPS inconsistencies at the application layer
are higher than those at the transport layer. We also find that HTTPS security inconsistencies are
strongly related to URLs and IPs diversity among regions, and to a lesser extent to the presence of
redirections. Further manual inspection shows that there are several reasons behind URLs diversity
among regions such as downgrading to the plain-HTTP protocol, using different subdomains, different
TLDs, or different home page documents. Furthermore, we find that downgrading to plain-HTTP is
related to websites' regional blocking. We also provide attack scenarios that show how an attacker
can benefit from HTTPS security inconsistencies, and introduce a new attack scenario which we call
the "region confusion" attack. Finally, based on our analysis and observations, we provide discussion,
which include some recommendations such as the need for testing tools for domain administrators
and users that help to mitigate and detect regional domains' inconsistencies, standardising regional
domains format with the same-origin policy (of domains) in mind, standardising secure URL redirections,
and avoid redirections whenever possible.

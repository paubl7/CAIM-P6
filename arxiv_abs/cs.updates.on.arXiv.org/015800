Scientific workflow applications have become mainstream and their automated and efficient execution
on large-scale compute platforms is the object of extensive research and development. For these
efforts to be successful, a solid experimental methodology is needed to evaluate workflow algorithms
and systems. A foundation for this methodology is the availability of realistic workflow instances.
Dozens of workflow instances for a few scientific applications are available in public repositories.
While these are invaluable, they are limited: workflow instances are not available for all application
scales of interest. To address this limitation, previous work has developed generators of synthetic,
but representative, workflow instances of arbitrary scales. These generators are popular, but
implementing them is a manual, labor-intensive process that requires expert application knowledge.
As a result, these generators only target a handful of applications, even though hundreds of applications
use workflows in production. In this work, we present WfChef, a framework that fully automates the
process of constructing a synthetic workflow generator for any scientific application. Based
on an input set of workflow instances, WfChef automatically produces a synthetic workflow generator.
We define and evaluate several metrics for quantifying the realism of the generated workflows.
Using these metrics, we compare the realism of the workflows generated by WfChef generators to that
of the workflows generated by the previously available, hand-crafted generators. We find that
the WfChef generators not only require zero development effort (because it is automatically produced),
but also generate workflows that are more realistic than those generated by hand-crafted generators.

We consider the energy complexity of the leader election problem in the single-hop radio network
model, where each device has a unique identifier in $\{1, 2, \ldots, N\}$. Energy is a scarce resource
for small battery-powered devices. For such devices, most of the energy is often spent on communication,
not on computation. To approximate the actual energy cost, the energy complexity of an algorithm
is defined as the maximum over all devices of the number of time slots where the device transmits or
listens. Much progress has been made in understanding the energy complexity of leader election
in radio networks, but very little is known about the trade-off between time and energy. $\textbf{Time-energy
trade-off:}$ For any $k \geq \log \log N$, we show that a leader among at most $n$ devices can be elected
deterministically in $O(n^{1+\epsilon}) + O(k \cdot N^{1/k})$ time and $O(k)$ energy if each device
can simultaneously transmit and listen, where $\epsilon > 0$ is any small constant. This improves
upon the previous $O(N)$-time $O(\log \log N)$-energy algorithm by Chang et al. [STOC 2017]. We
provide lower bounds to show that the time-energy trade-off of our algorithm is near-optimal. $\textbf{Dense
instances:}$ For the dense instances where the number of devices is $n = \Theta(N)$, we design a deterministic
leader election algorithm using only $O(1)$ energy. This improves upon the $O(\log^* N)$-energy
algorithm by Jurdzi\'{n}ski et al. [PODC 2002] and the $O(\alpha(N))$-energy algorithm by Chang
et al. [STOC 2017]. More specifically, we show that the optimal deterministic energy complexity
of leader election is $\Theta\left(\max\left\{1, \log \frac{N}{n}\right\}\right)$ if the devices
cannot simultaneously transmit and listen, and it is $\Theta\left(\max\left\{1, \log \log \frac{N}{n}\right\}\right)$
if they can.

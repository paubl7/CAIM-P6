We study radio-frequency (RF) wireless power transfer (WPT) using a digital radio transmitter
for applications where alternative analog transmit circuits are impractical. An important paramter
for assessing the viability of an RF WPT system is its end-to-end efficiency. In this regard, we present
a prototype test-bed comprising a software-defined radio (SDR) transmitter and an energy harvesting
receiver with a low resistive load; employing an SDR makes our research meaningful for simultaneous
wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT). We analyze the effect of clipping and non-linear
amplification at the SDR on multisine waveforms. Our experiments suggest that when the DC input
power at the transmitter is constant, high peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) multisine are unsuitable
for RF WPT over a flat-fading channel, due to their low average radiated power. The results indicate
that the end-to-end efficiency is positively correlated to the average RF power of the waveform,
and that it reduces with increasing PAPR. Consequently, digital modulations such as phase-shift
keying (PSK) and quadrature amplitude modeulation (QAM) yield better end-to-end efficiency than
multisines. Moreover, the end-to-end efficiency of PSK and QAM signals is invariant of the transmission
bit rate. An in-depth analysis of the end-to-end efficiency of WPT reveals that the transmitter
efficiency is lower than the receiver efficiency. Furthermore, we study the impact of a reflecting
surface on the end-to-end efficiency of WPT, and assess the transmission quality of the information
signals by evaluating their error vector magnitude (EVM) for SWIPT. Overall, the experimental
observations of end-to-end efficiency and EVM suggest that, while employing an SDR transmitter
with fixed DC input power, a baseband quadrature PSK signal is most suitable for SWIPT at large, among
PSK and QAM signals.

Background and Motivation: In recent years, the topic of applying videos in requirements engineering
has been discussed and its contributions are of interesting potential. In the last 35 years, several
researchers proposed approaches for applying videos in requirements engineering due to their
communication richness and effectiveness. However, these approaches mainly use videos but omit
the details about how to produce them. This lack of guidance is one crucial reason why videos are not
an established documentation option for successful requirements communication and thus shared
understanding. Software professionals are not directors and thus they do not necessarily know
what constitutes a good video in general and for an existing approach. Therefore, this lack of knowledge
and skills on how to produce and use videos for visual communication impedes the application of videos
by software professionals in requirements engineering. How to Create Effective Videos and Vision
Videos?: This technical report addresses this lack of knowledge and skills by software professionals.
We provide two guidelines that can be used as checklists to avoid frequent flaws in the production
and use of videos respectively vision videos. Software professionals without special training
should be able to follow these guidelines to achieve the basic capabilities to produce (vision)
videos that are accepted by their stakeholders. These guidelines represent a core set of those capabilities
in the preproduction, shooting, postproduction, and viewing of (vision) videos. We do not strive
for perfection in any of these capabilities, .e.g., technical handling of video equipment, storytelling,
or video editing. Instead, these guidelines support all steps of the (vision) video production
and use process to a balanced way.

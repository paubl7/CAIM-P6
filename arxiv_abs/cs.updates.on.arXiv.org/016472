Multi-source-extractors are functions that extract uniform randomness from multiple (weak)
sources of randomness. Quantum multi-source-extractors were considered by Kasher and Kempe (for
the quantum-independent-adversary and the quantum-bounded-storage-adversary), Chung, Li
and Wu (for the general-entangled-adversary) and Arnon-Friedman, Portmann and Scholz (for the
quantum-Markov-adversary). One of the main objectives of this work is to unify all the existing
quantum multi-source adversary models. We propose two new models of adversaries: 1) the quantum-measurement-adversary
(qm-adv), which generates side-information using entanglement and on post-measurement and 2)
the quantum-communication-adversary (qc-adv), which generates side-information using entanglement
and communication between multiple sources. We show that, 1. qm-adv is the strongest adversary
among all the known adversaries, in the sense that the side-information of all other adversaries
can be generated by qm-adv. 2. The (generalized) inner-product function (in fact a general class
of two-wise independent functions) continues to work as a good extractor against qm-adv with matching
parameters as that of Chor and Goldreich. 3. A non-malleable-extractor proposed by Li (against
classical-adversaries) continues to be secure against quantum side-information. This result
implies a non-malleable-extractor result of Aggarwal, Chung, Lin and Vidick with uniform seed.
We strengthen their result via a completely different proof to make the non-malleable-extractor
of Li secure against quantum side-information even when the seed is not uniform. 4. A modification
(working with weak sources instead of uniform sources) of the Dodis and Wichs protocol for privacy-amplification
is secure against active quantum adversaries. This strengthens on a recent result due to Aggarwal,
Chung, Lin and Vidick which uses uniform sources.

Non-terrestrial networks, including Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), High Altitude Platform
Station (HAPS) and Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) satellites, are expected to have a pivotal role in the
sixth generation wireless networks. With their inherent features such as flexible placement,
wide footprint, and preferred channel conditions, they can tackle several challenges in current
terrestrial networks However, their successful and widespread adoption relies on energy-efficient
on-board communication systems. In this context, the integration of Reconfigurable Smart Surfaces
(RSS) into aerial platforms is envisioned as a key enabler of energy-efficient and cost-effective
deployments of aerial platforms. Indeed, RSS consist of low-cost reflectors capable of smartly
directing signals in a nearly passive way. We investigate in this paper the link budget of RSS-assisted
communications under the two discussed RSS reflection paradigms in the literature, namely the
specular and the scattering reflection paradigm types. Specifically, we analyze the characteristics
of RSS-equipped aerial platforms and compare their communication performance with that of RSS-assisted
terrestrial networks, using standardized channel models. In addition, we derive the optimal aerial
platforms placements under both reflection paradigms. The obtained results provide important
insights for the design of RSS-assisted communications. For instance, given that a HAPS has a large
RSS surface, it provides superior link budget performance in most studied scenarios. In contrast,
the limited RSS area on UAVs and the large propagation loss in LEO satellite communications make
them unfavorable candidates for supporting terrestrial users. Finally, the optimal location
of the RSS-equipped platform may depend on the platform's altitude, coverage footprint, and type
of environment.

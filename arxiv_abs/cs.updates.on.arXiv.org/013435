In this work, a modified neural architecture search method (NAS) based physics-informed deep learning
model is presented for stochastic analysis in heterogeneous porous material. Monte Carlo method
based on a randomized spectral representation is first employed to construct a stochastic model
for simulation of flow through porous media. To solve the governing equations for stochastic groundwater
flow problem, we build a modified NAS model based on physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) with
transfer learning in this paper that will be able to fit different partial differential equations
(PDEs) with less calculation. The performance estimation strategies adopted is constructed from
an error estimation model using the method of manufactured solutions. A sensitivity analysis is
performed to obtain the prior knowledge of the PINNs model and narrow down the range of parameters
for search space and use hyper-parameter optimization algorithms to further determine the values
of the parameters. Further the NAS based PINNs model also saves the weights and biases of the most
favorable architectures, then used in the fine-tuning process. It is found that the log-conductivity
field using Gaussian correlation function will perform much better than exponential correlation
case, which is more fitted to the PINNs model and the modified neural architecture search based PINNs
model shows a great potential in approximating solutions to PDEs. Moreover, a three dimensional
stochastic flow model is built to provide a benchmark to the simulation of groundwater flow in highly
heterogeneous aquifers. The NAS model based deep collocation method is verified to be effective
and accurate through numerical examples in different dimensions using different manufactured
solutions.

Background: Providing appropriate care for people suffering from COVID-19, the disease caused
by the pandemic SARS-CoV-2 virus is a significant global challenge. Many individuals who become
infected have pre-existing conditions that may interact with COVID-19 to increase symptom severity
and mortality risk. COVID-19 patient comorbidities are likely to be informative about individual
risk of severe illness and mortality. Accurately determining how comorbidities are associated
with severe symptoms and mortality would thus greatly assist in COVID-19 care planning and provision.
Methods: To assess the interaction of patient comorbidities with COVID-19 severity and mortality
we performed a meta-analysis of the published global literature, and machine learning predictive
analysis using an aggregated COVID-19 global dataset. Results: Our meta-analysis identified
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebrovascular disease (CEVD), cardiovascular
disease (CVD), type 2 diabetes, malignancy, and hypertension as most significantly associated
with COVID-19 severity in the current published literature. Machine learning classification
using novel aggregated cohort data similarly found COPD, CVD, CKD, type 2 diabetes, malignancy
and hypertension, as well as asthma, as the most significant features for classifying those deceased
versus those who survived COVID-19. While age and gender were the most significant predictor of
mortality, in terms of symptom-comorbidity combinations, it was observed that Pneumonia-Hypertension,
Pneumonia-Diabetes and Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)-Hypertension showed the
most significant effects on COVID-19 mortality. Conclusions: These results highlight patient
cohorts most at risk of COVID-19 related severe morbidity and mortality which have implications
for prioritization of hospital resources.

SC-Flip (SCF) is a low-complexity polar code decoding algorithm with improved performance, and
is an alternative to high-complexity (CRC)-aided SC-List (CA-SCL) decoding. However, the performance
improvement of SCF is limited since it can correct up to only one channel error ($\omega=1$). Dynamic
SCF (DSCF) algorithm tackles this problem by tackling multiple errors ($\omega \geq 1$), but it
requires logarithmic and exponential computations, which make it infeasible for practical applications.
In this work, we propose simplifications and approximations to make DSCF practically feasible.
First, we reduce the transcendental computations of DSCF decoding to a constant approximation.
Then, we show how to incorporate special node decoding techniques into DSCF algorithm, creating
the Fast-DSCF decoding. Next, we reduce the search span within the special nodes to further reduce
the computational complexity. Following, we describe a hardware architecture for the Fast-DSCF
decoder, in which we introduce additional simplifications such as metric normalization and sorter
length reduction. All the simplifications and approximations are shown to have minimal impact
on the error-correction performance, and the reported Fast-DSCF decoder is the only SCF-based
architecture that can correct multiple errors. The Fast-DSCF decoders synthesized using TSMC
$65$nm CMOS technology can achieve a $1.25$, $1.06$ and $0.93$ Gbps throughput for $\omega \in \{1,2,3\}$,
respectively. Compared to the state-of-the-art fast CA-SCL decoders with equivalent FER performance,
the proposed decoders are up to $5.8\times$ more area-efficient. Finally, observations at energy
dissipation indicate that the Fast-DSCF is more energy-efficient than its CA-SCL-based counterparts.

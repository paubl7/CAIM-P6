This paper studies the feasibility of deploying intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) in massive
MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) systems to improve the performance of users in the service
dead zone. To reduce the channel training overhead, we advocate a novel protocol for the uplink communication
in the IRS-assisted massive MIMO systems. Under this protocol, the IRS reflection coefficients
are optimized based on the channel covariance matrices, which are generally fixed for many coherence
blocks, to boost the long-term performance. Then, given the IRS reflecting coefficients, the BS
beamforming vectors are designed in each coherence block based on the effective channel of each
user, which is the superposition of its direct and reflected user-IRS-BS channels, to improve the
instantaneous performance. Since merely the user effective channels are estimated in each coherence
block, the training overhead of this protocol is the same as that in the legacy wireless systems without
IRSs. Moreover, in the asymptotic regime that the numbers of IRS elements and BS antennas both go
to infinity with a fixed ratio, we manage to first characterize the minimum mean-squared error (MMSE)
estimators of the user effective channels and then quantify the closed-form user achievable rates
as functions of channel covariance matrices with channel training overhead and estimation error
taken into account. Interestingly, it is shown that the properties of channel hardening and favorable
propagation still hold for the user effective channels, and satisfactory user rates are thus achievable
even if simple BS beamforming solutions, e.g., maximal-ratio combining, are employed. Finally,
thanks to the rate characterization, we design a low-complexity algorithm to optimize the IRS reflection
coefficients based on channel covariance matrices.

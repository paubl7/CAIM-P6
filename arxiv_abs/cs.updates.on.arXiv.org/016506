In this paper we consider the Ideal Membership Problem (IMP for short), in which we are given real
polynomials $f_0,f_1,\dots, f_k$ and the question is to decide whether $f_0$ belongs to the ideal
generated by $f_1,\dots,f_k$. In the more stringent version the task is also to find a proof of this
fact. The IMP underlies many proof systems based on polynomials such as Nullstellensatz, Polynomial
Calculus, and Sum-of-Squares. In the majority of such applications the IMP involves so called combinatorial
ideals that arise from a variety of discrete combinatorial problems. This restriction makes the
IMP significantly easier and in some cases allows for an efficient algorithm to solve it. The first
part of this paper follows the work of Mastrolilli [SODA'19] who initiated a systematic study of
IMPs arising from Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSP) of the form $CSP(\Gamma)$, that is, CSPs
in which the type of constraints is limited to relations from a set $\Gamma$. We show that many CSP
techniques can be translated to IMPs thus allowing us to significantly improve the methods of studying
the complexity of the IMP. We also develop universal algebraic techniques for the IMP that have been
so useful in the study of the CSP. This allows us to prove a general necessary condition for the tractability
of the IMP, and three sufficient ones. The sufficient conditions include IMPs arising from systems
of linear equations over $GF(p)$, $p$ prime, and also some conditions defined through special kinds
of polymorphisms. Our work has several consequences and applications in terms of bit complexity
of sum-of-squares (SOS) proofs and their automatizability, and studying (construction of) theta
bodies of combinatorial problems.

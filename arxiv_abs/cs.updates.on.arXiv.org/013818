Farmers need to be efficient and dedicate a lot of time in order to sustain the quality of their animals
which are in their care. The most convenient and good quality - price ratio should be chosen for the
feed of animals. Blockchain is used in a virtual space to store and share information over a network
of users. This is done using the open source Hyperledger Fabric platform. The transactions can be
viewed by all the other users in real time. These transactions are stored as JSONs inside CouchDB
NoSQL database which supports queries on a large volume of data. When using this technology, the
farmer can know with whom the supplier for animal feed collaborated with. The history of the transactions
are not saved in just one place. In this way, it is more difficult to hack and provide implausible information.
An e-learning platform was created where the farm's user can post information, respectively new
blocks about the animal's birth, vaccinations, medicines, including the location of the livestock.
The same e-learning platform is accessible from the mobile phone. By using the blockchain technology,
anyone, including the client from the shop can know a lot about the origin of the products. Fake origins
of food are much more difficult to hide. Fraud is also limited. The system monitored the traceability
of dairy products inside a Romanian farm. Data about fodder provider and quality, cow productive
performances and health and dairy products process were obtained and analyzed by students who will
become specialists at all the levels of the food chain. Blockchain is the technology which in case
of a dairy products contamination, the origin of the farm is traced in just a couple of seconds. In
this way just a batch of dairy products is removed from distribution, leading to the reduction of
food waste.

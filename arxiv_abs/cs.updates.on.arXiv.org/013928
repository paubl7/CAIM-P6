On-board embedded software developed for spaceflight systems (space software) must adhere to
stringent software quality assurance procedures. To further minimize the risk of human mistakes,
space agencies, such as the European Space Agency (ESA), are looking for automated solutions for
the assessment of software testing activities, which play a crucial role in this context. Though
space software is our focus here, it should be noted that such software shares the above considerations,
to a large extent, with embedded software in many other types of cyber-physical systems. Over the
years, mutation analysis has shown to be a promising solution for the automated assessment of test
suites; furthermore, a number of optimization techniques, addressing scalability and accuracy
problems, have been proposed to facilitate the industrial adoption of mutation analysis. However,
to date, two major problems prevent space agencies from enforcing mutation analysis in space software
development. First, there is uncertainty regarding the feasibility of applying mutation analysis
optimization techniques in their context. Second, most of the existing techniques either can break
the real-time requirements common in embedded software or cannot be applied when the software is
tested in Software Validation Facilities, including CPU emulators and sensor simulators. In this
paper, we enhance mutation analysis optimization techniques to enable their applicability to
embedded software and propose a pipeline that successfully integrates them to address scalability
and accuracy issues in this context, as described above. Further, we report on the largest study
involving embedded software systems in the mutation analysis literature. Our research is part
of a research project funded by ESA ESTEC involving private companies (Company1 and Company2) in
the space sector.

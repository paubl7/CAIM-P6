The fundamental task of classification given a limited number of training data samples is considered
for physical systems with known parametric statistical models. The standalone learning-based
and statistical model-based classifiers face major challenges towards the fulfillment of the
classification task using a small training set. Specifically, classifiers that solely rely on
the physics-based statistical models usually suffer from their inability to properly tune the
underlying unobservable parameters, which leads to a mismatched representation of the system's
behaviors. Learning-based classifiers, on the other hand, typically rely on a large number of training
data from the underlying physical process, which might not be feasible in most practical scenarios.
In this paper, a hybrid classification method -- termed HyPhyLearn -- is proposed that exploits
both the physics-based statistical models and the learning-based classifiers. The proposed solution
is based on the conjecture that HyPhyLearn would alleviate the challenges associated with the individual
approaches of learning-based and statistical model-based classifiers by fusing their respective
strengths. The proposed hybrid approach first estimates the unobservable model parameters using
the available (suboptimal) statistical estimation procedures, and subsequently use the physics-based
statistical models to generate synthetic data. Then, the training data samples are incorporated
with the synthetic data in a learning-based classifier that is based on domain-adversarial training
of neural networks. Specifically, in order to address the mismatch problem, the classifier learns
a mapping from the training data and the synthetic data to a common feature space. Simultaneously,
the classifier is trained to find discriminative features within this space in order to fulfill
the classification task.

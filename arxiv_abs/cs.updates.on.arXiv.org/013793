Political polarization in the US is on the rise. This polarization negatively affects the public
sphere by contributing to the creation of ideological echo chambers. In this paper, we focus on addressing
one of the factors that contributes to this polarity, polarized media. We introduce a framework
for depolarizing news articles. Given an article on a certain topic with a particular ideological
slant (eg., liberal or conservative), the framework first detects polar language in the article
and then generates a new article with the polar language replaced with neutral expressions. To detect
polar words, we train a multi-attribute-aware word embedding model that is aware of ideology and
topics on 360k full-length media articles. Then, for text generation, we propose a new algorithm
called Text Annealing Depolarization Algorithm (TADA). TADA retrieves neutral expressions from
the word embedding model that not only decrease ideological polarity but also preserve the original
argument of the text, while maintaining grammatical correctness. We evaluate our framework by
comparing the depolarized output of our model in two modes, fully-automatic and semi-automatic,
on 99 stories spanning 11 topics. Based on feedback from 161 human testers, our framework successfully
depolarized 90.1% of paragraphs in semi-automatic mode and 78.3% of paragraphs in fully-automatic
mode. Furthermore, 81.2% of the testers agree that the non-polar content information is well-preserved
and 79% agree that depolarization does not harm semantic correctness when they compare the original
text and the depolarized text. Our work shows that data-driven methods can help to locate political
polarity and aid in the depolarization of articles.

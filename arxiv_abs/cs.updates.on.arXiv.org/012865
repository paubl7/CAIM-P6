Flexoelectricity refers to a phenomenon which involves a coupling of the mechanical strain gradient
and electric polarization. In this study, a meshless Fragile Points Method (FPM), is presented
for analyzing flexoelectric effects in dielectric solids. Local, simple, polynomial and discontinuous
trial and test functions are generated with the help of a local meshless Differential Quadrature
approximation of derivatives. Both primal and mixed FPM are developed, based on two alternate flexoelectric
theories, with or without the electric gradient effect and Maxwell stress. In the present primal
as well as mixed FPM, only the displacements and electric potential are retained as explicit unknown
variables at each internal Fragile Point in the final algebraic equations. Thus the number of unknowns
in the final system of algebraic equations is kept to be absolutely minimal. An algorithm for simulating
crack initiation and propagation using the present FPM is presented, with classic stress-based
criterion as well as a Bonding-Energy-Rate(BER)-based criterion for crack development. The present
primal and mixed FPM approaches represent clear advantages as compared to the current methods for
computational flexoelectric analyses, using primal as well as mixed Finite Element Methods, Element
Free Galerkin (EFG) Methods, Meshless Local Petrov Galerkin (MLPG) Methods, and Isogeometric
Analysis (IGA) Methods, because of the following new features: they are simpler Galerkin meshless
methods using polynomial trial and test functions; minimal DoFs per Point make it very user-friendly;
arbitrary polygonal subdomains make it flexible for modeling complex geometries; the numerical
integration of the primal as well as mixed FPM weak forms is trivially simple; and FPM can be easily
employed in crack development simulations without remeshing or trial function enhancement.

Interdisciplinary research is often at the core of scientific progress. This dissertation explores
some advantageous synergies between machine learning, cognitive science and neuroscience. In
particular, this thesis focuses on vision and images. The human visual system has been widely studied
from both behavioural and neuroscientific points of view, as vision is the dominant sense of most
people. In turn, machine vision has also been an active area of research, currently dominated by
the use of artificial neural networks. This work focuses on learning representations that are more
aligned with visual perception and the biological vision. For that purpose, I have studied tools
and aspects from cognitive science and computational neuroscience, and attempted to incorporate
them into machine learning models of vision. A central subject of this dissertation is data augmentation,
a commonly used technique for training artificial neural networks to augment the size of data sets
through transformations of the images. Although often overlooked, data augmentation implements
transformations that are perceptually plausible, since they correspond to the transformations
we see in our visual world -- changes in viewpoint or illumination, for instance. Furthermore, neuroscientists
have found that the brain invariantly represents objects under these transformations. Throughout
this dissertation, I use these insights to analyse data augmentation as a particularly useful inductive
bias, a more effective regularisation method for artificial neural networks, and as the framework
to analyse and improve the invariance of vision models to perceptually plausible transformations.
Overall, this work aims to shed more light on the properties of data augmentation and demonstrate
the potential of interdisciplinary research.

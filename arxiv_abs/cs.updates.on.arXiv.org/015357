Dietary supplements are widely used but not always safe. With the rapid development of the Internet,
consumers usually seek health information including dietary supplement information online.
To help consumers access quality online dietary supplement information, we have identified trustworthy
dietary supplement information sources and built an evidence-based knowledge base of dietary
supplement information-the integrated DIetary Supplement Knowledge base (iDISK) that integrates
and standardizes dietary supplement related information across these different sources. However,
as information in iDISK was collected from scientific sources, the complex medical jargon is a barrier
for consumers' comprehension. To assess how different approaches to simplify and represent dietary
supplement information from iDISK will affect lay consumers' comprehension, using a crowdsourcing
platform, we recruited participants to read dietary supplement information in four different
representations from iDISK: original text, syntactic and lexical text simplification, manual
text simplification, and a graph-based visualization. We then assessed how the different simplification
and representation strategies affected consumers' comprehension of dietary supplement information
in terms of accuracy and response time to a set of comprehension questions. With responses from 690
qualified participants, our experiments confirmed that the manual approach had the best performance
for both accuracy and response time to the comprehension questions, while the graph-based approach
ranked the second outperforming other representations. In some cases, the graph-based representation
outperformed the manual approach in terms of response time. A hybrid approach that combines text
and graph-based representations might be needed to accommodate consumers' different information
needs and information seeking behavior.

In today's world, social networks have become one of the primary sources for creation and propagation
of news. Social news aggregators are one of the actors in this area in which users post news items and
use positive or negative votes to indicate their preference toward a news item. News items will be
ordered and displayed according to their aggregated votes. This approach suffers from several
problems raging from being prone to the dominance of the majority to difficulty in discerning between
correct and fake news, and lack of incentive for honest behaviors. In this paper, we propose a graph-based
news aggregator in which instead of voting on the news items, users submit their votes on the relations
between pairs of news items. More precisely, if a user believes two news items support each other,
he will submit a positive vote on the link between the two items, and if he believes that two news items
undermine each other, he will submit a negative vote on the corresponding link. This approach has
mainly two desirable features: (1) mitigating the effect of personal preferences on voting, (2)
connection of new items to endorsing and disputing evidence. This approach helps the newsreaders
to understand different aspects of a news item better. We also introduce an incentive layer that
uses blockchain as a distributed transparent manager to encourages users to behave honestly and
abstain from adversary behaviors. The incentive layer takes into account that users can have different
viewpoints toward news, enabling users from a wide range of viewpoints to contribute to the network
and benefit from its rewards. In addition, we introduce a protocol that enables us to prove fraud
in computations of the incentive layer model on the blockchain. Ultimately, we will analyze the
fraud proof protocol and examine our incentive layer on a wide range of synthesized datasets.

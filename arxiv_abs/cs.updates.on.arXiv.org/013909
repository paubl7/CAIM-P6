The ability to detect anomalies in time series is considered highly valuable in numerous application
domains. The sequential nature of time series objects is responsible for an additional feature
complexity, ultimately requiring specialized approaches in order to solve the task. Essential
characteristics of time series, situated outside the time domain, are often difficult to capture
with state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods when no transformations have been applied to
the time series. Inspired by the success of deep learning methods in computer vision, several studies
have proposed transforming time series into image-like representations, used as inputs for deep
learning models, and have led to very promising results in classification tasks. In this paper,
we first review the signal to image encoding approaches found in the literature. Second, we propose
modifications to some of their original formulations to make them more robust to the variability
in large datasets. Third, we compare them on the basis of a common unsupervised task to demonstrate
how the choice of the encoding can impact the results when used in the same deep learning architecture.
We thus provide a comparison between six encoding algorithms with and without the proposed modifications.
The selected encoding methods are Gramian Angular Field, Markov Transition Field, recurrence
plot, grey scale encoding, spectrogram, and scalogram. We also compare the results achieved with
the raw signal used as input for another deep learning model. We demonstrate that some encodings
have a competitive advantage and might be worth considering within a deep learning framework. The
comparison is performed on a dataset collected and released by Airbus SAS, containing highly complex
vibration measurements from real helicopter flight tests. The different encodings provide competitive
results for anomaly detection.

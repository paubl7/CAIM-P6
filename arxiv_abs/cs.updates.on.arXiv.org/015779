Modern traceability technologies promise to improve supply chain management by simplifying recalls,
increasing demand visibility, or ascertaining sustainable supplier practices. Managers in the
traceability initiatives developing such technologies face a difficult question: which companies
should they target as early adopters to ensure that their technology is broadly employed? To answer
this question, managers must consider that supply chains are interlinked in complex networks and
that a supply chain effect is inherent to traceability technologies. More specifically, the benefits
obtained from traceability are conditional on technology adoption throughout a product's supply
chain. We introduce a model of the dynamics of traceability technology adoption in supply chain
networks to tackle the problem of selecting the smallest set of early adopters guaranteeing broad
dissemination. Our model builds on extant diffusion models while incorporating that a firm's adoption
decision depends on previous adoption decisions throughout its supply chains. We show that the
problem is NP-hard and that no approximation within a polylogarithmic factor can be guaranteed
for any polynomial-time algorithm. Nevertheless, we introduce an algorithm that identifies an
exact solution in polynomial time under certain assumptions on the network structure and provide
evidence that it is tractable for real-world supply chain networks. We further propose a random
generative model that outputs networks consistent with real-world supply chain networks. The
networks obtained display, whp, structures that allow us to find the optimal seed set in subexponential
time using our algorithm. Our generative model also provides approximate seed sets when information
on the network is limited.

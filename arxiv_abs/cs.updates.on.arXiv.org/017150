Edge computing enables Mobile Autonomous Systems (MASs) to execute continuous streams of heavy-duty
mission-critical processing tasks, such as real-time obstacle detection and navigation. However,
in practical applications, erratic patterns in channel quality, network load, and edge server
load can interrupt the task flow execution, which necessarily leads to severe disruption of the
system's key operations. Existing work has mostly tackled the problem with reactive approaches,
which cannot guarantee task-level reliability. Conversely, in this paper we focus on learning-based
predictive edge computing to achieve self-resilient task offloading. By conducting a preliminary
experimental evaluation, we show that there is no dominant feature that can predict the edge-MAS
system reliability, which calls for an ensemble and selection of weaker features. To tackle the
complexity of the problem, we propose SeReMAS, a data-driven optimization framework. We first
mathematically formulate a Redundant Task Offloading Problem (RTOP), where a MAS may connect to
multiple edge servers for redundancy, and needs to select which server(s) to transmit its computing
tasks in order to maximize the probability of task execution while minimizing channel and edge resource
utilization. We then create a predictor based on Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), which produces
the optimum task assignment based on application-, network- and telemetry-based features. We
prototype SeReMAS on a testbed composed by a drone, mounting a PixHawk flight controller, a Jetson
Nano board, and three 802.11n WiFi interfaces. We extensively evaluate SeReMAS by considering
an application where one drone offloads high-resolution images for real-time analysis to three
edge servers on the ground. Experimental results show that SeReMAS improves task execution probability
by $17\%$ with respect to existing reactive-based approaches.

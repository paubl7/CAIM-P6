Micropumps are one of the most important parts of a microfluidic system. In particular, for biomedical
applications such as Lab-on-Chip systems, micropumps are used to transport and manipulate test
fluids in a controlled manner. In this work, a low-cost, structurally simple, piezoelectrically
actuated micropump was simulated and fabricated using poly-dimethylsiloxane (PDMS). The channels
in PDMS were fabricated using patterned SU-8 structures. The pump flow rate was measured to be 9.49
uL/min, 14.06 uL/min, 20.87 uL/min for applied voltages of 12 V, 14 V, 16 V respectively. Further,
we report finite element analysis (FEA) simulation to confirm the operation of the micropump and
compare favorably the experimentally obtained flowrate with the one predicted by simulation.
By taking these flow rates as a reference, the chamber pressure was found to be 1.1 to 1.5 kPa from FEA
simulations. Viscosity measurement has wide-ranging applications from the oil industry to the
pharmaceutical industry. This work provides an elaborate mathematical model and study of measurement
of viscosity in real-time using pressure sensors. For a given flowrate, a change in liquid viscosity
gives rise to a change in pressure difference across a particular section of the pipe. Hence, by recording
the pressure change, viscosity can be calculated dynamically. Mathematical modeling as well as
finite element analysis (FEA) modeling has been presented. A set of pressure sensors were placed
at a fixed distance from each other to get the real-time pressure change. Knowing the flow rate in
the channel, the viscosity has been calculated from the pressure difference. For the finite element
analysis, the pressure sensors were placed 60 mm away from each other. A different ratio of the mixture
of water and glycerol was used to provide variable viscosity, which led to the variation in pressure-difference
values.

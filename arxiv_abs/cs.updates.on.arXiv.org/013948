Open and shared manufacturing factories typically dispose of a limited number of robots that should
be properly allocated to tasks in time and space for an effective and efficient system performance.
In particular, we deal with the dynamic capacitated production planning problem with sequence
independent setup costs where quantities of products to manufacture and location of robots need
to be determined at consecutive periods within a given time horizon and products can be anticipated
or backordered related to the demand period. We consider a decentralized multi-agent variant of
this problem in an open factory setting with multiple owners of robots as well as different owners
of the items to be produced, both considered self-interested and individually rational. Existing
solution approaches to the classic constrained lot-sizing problem are centralized exact methods
that require sharing of global knowledge of all the participants' private and sensitive information
and are not applicable in the described multi-agent context. Therefore, we propose a computationally
efficient decentralized approach based on the spillover effect that solves this NP-hard problem
by distributing decisions in an intrinsically decentralized multi-agent system environment
while protecting private and sensitive information. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
decentralized algorithm for the solution of the studied problem in intrinsically decentralized
environments where production resources and/or products are owned by multiple stakeholders with
possibly conflicting objectives. To show its efficiency, the performance of the Spillover Algorithm
is benchmarked against state-of-the-art commercial solver CPLEX 12.8.

Automated skin lesion analysis for simultaneous detection and recognition is still challenging
for inter-class homogeneity and intra-class heterogeneity, leading to low generic capability
of a Single Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with limited datasets. This article proposes an
end-to-end deep CNN-based framework for simultaneous detection and recognition of the skin lesions,
named Dermo-DOCTOR, consisting of two encoders. The feature maps from two encoders are fused channel-wise,
called Fused Feature Map (FFM). The FFM is utilized for decoding in the detection sub-network, concatenating
each stage of two encoders' outputs with corresponding decoder layers to retrieve the lost spatial
information due to pooling in the encoders. For the recognition sub-network, the outputs of three
fully connected layers, utilizing feature maps of two encoders and FFM, are aggregated to obtain
a final lesion class. We train and evaluate the proposed Dermo-Doctor utilizing two publicly available
benchmark datasets, such as ISIC-2016 and ISIC-2017. The achieved segmentation results exhibit
mean intersection over unions of 85.0 % and 80.0 % respectively for ISIC-2016 and ISIC-2017 test
datasets. The proposed Dermo-DOCTOR also demonstrates praiseworthy success in lesion recognition,
providing the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.98 and 0.91 respectively
for those two datasets. The experimental results show that the proposed Dermo-DOCTOR outperforms
the alternative methods mentioned in the literature, designed for skin lesion detection and recognition.
As the Dermo-DOCTOR provides better-results on two different test datasets, even with limited
training data, it can be an auspicious computer-aided assistive tool for dermatologists.

Problem definition: Corporate brands, grassroots activists, and ordinary citizens all routinely
employ Word-of-mouth (WoM) diffusion to promote products and instigate social change. Our work
models the formation and spread of negative attitudes via WoM on a social network represented by
a directed graph. In an online learning setting, we examine how an agent could simultaneously learn
diffusion parameters and choose sets of seed users to initiate diffusions and maximize positive
influence. In contrast to edge-level feedback, in which an agent observes the relationship (edge)
through which a user (node) is influenced, we more realistically assume node-level feedback, where
an agent only observes when a user is influenced and whether that influence is positive or negative.
Methodology/results: We propose a new class of negativity-aware Linear Threshold Models. We show
that in these models, the expected positive influence spread is a monotone submodular function
of the seed set. Therefore, when maximizing positive influence by selecting a seed set of fixed size,
a greedy algorithm can guarantee a solution with a constant approximation ratio. For the online
learning setting, we propose an algorithm that runs in epochs of growing lengths, each consisting
of a fixed number of exploration rounds followed by an increasing number of exploitation rounds
controlled by a hyperparameter. Under mild assumptions, we show that our algorithm achieves asymptotic
expected average scaled regret that is inversely related to any fractional constant power of the
number of rounds. Managerial implications: During seed selection, our negativity-aware models
and algorithms allow WoM campaigns to discover and best account for characteristics of local users
and propagated content. We also give the first algorithms with regret guarantees for influence
maximization under node-level feedback.

In this work, we study underlay radar-massive MIMO cellular coexistence in LoS/near-LoS channels,
where both systems have 3D beamforming capabilities. Using mathematical tools from stochastic
geometry, we derive an upper bound on the average interference power at the radar due to the 3D massive
MIMO cellular downlink under the worst-case `cell-edge beamforming' conditions. To overcome
the technical challenges imposed by asymmetric and arbitrarily large cells, we devise a novel construction
in which each Poisson Voronoi (PV) cell is bounded by its circumcircle to bound the effect of the random
cell shapes on average interference. Since this model is intractable for further analysis due to
the correlation between adjacent PV cells' shapes and sizes, we propose a tractable nominal interference
model, where we model each PV cell as a circular disk with an area equal to the average area of the typical
cell. We quantify the gap in the average interference power between these two models and show that
the upper bound is tight for realistic deployment parameters. We also compare them with a more practical
but intractable MU-MIMO scheduling model to show that our worst-case interference models show
the same trends and do not deviate significantly from realistic scheduler models. Under the nominal
interference model, we characterize the interference distribution using the dominant interferer
approximation by deriving the equi-interference contour expression when the typical receiver
uses 3D beamforming. Finally, we use tractable expressions for the interference distribution
to characterize radar's spatial probability of false alarm/detection in a quasi-static target
tracking scenario. Our results reveal useful trends in the average interference as a function of
the deployment parameters (BS density, exclusion zone radius, antenna height, transmit power
of each BS, etc.).

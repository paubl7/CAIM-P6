The COVID-19 pandemic has spurred a large amount of observational studies reporting linkages between
the risk of developing severe COVID-19 or dying from it, and sex and gender. By reviewing a large body
of related literature and conducting a fine grained analysis based on sex-disaggregated data of
61 countries spanning 5 continents, we discover several confounding factors that could possibly
explain the supposed male vulnerability to COVID-19. We thus highlight the challenge of making
causal claims based on available data, given the lack of statistical significance and potential
existence of biases. Informed by our findings on potential variables acting as confounders, we
contribute a broad overview on the issues bias, explainability and fairness entail in data-driven
analyses. Thus, we outline a set of discriminatory policy consequences that could, based on such
results, lead to unintended discrimination. To raise awareness on the dimensionality of such foreseen
impacts, we have compiled an encyclopedia-like reference guide, the Bias Catalog for Pandemics
(BCP), to provide definitions and emphasize realistic examples of bias in general, and within the
COVID-19 pandemic context. These are categorized within a division of bias families and a 2-level
priority scale, together with preventive steps. In addition, we facilitate the Bias Priority Recommendations
on how to best use and apply this catalog, and provide guidelines in order to address real world research
questions. The objective is to anticipate and avoid disparate impact and discrimination, by considering
causality, explainability, bias and techniques to mitigate the latter. With these, we hope to 1)
contribute to designing and conducting fair and equitable data-driven studies and research; and
2) interpret and draw meaningful and actionable conclusions from these.

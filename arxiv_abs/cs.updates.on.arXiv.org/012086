With increasing urbanization, in recent years there has been a growing interest and need in monitoring
and analyzing urban flood events. Social media, as a new data source, can provide real-time information
for flood monitoring. The social media posts with locations are often referred to as Volunteered
Geographic Information (VGI), which can reveal the spatial pattern of such events. Since more images
are shared on social media than ever before, recent research focused on the extraction of flood-related
posts by analyzing images in addition to texts. Apart from merely classifying posts as flood relevant
or not, more detailed information, e.g. the flood severity, can also be extracted based on image
interpretation. However, it has been less tackled and has not yet been applied for flood severity
mapping. In this paper, we propose a novel three-step process to extract and map flood severity information.
First, flood relevant images are retrieved with the help of pre-trained convolutional neural networks
as feature extractors. Second, the images containing people are further classified into four severity
levels by observing the relationship between body parts and their partial inundation, i.e. images
are classified according to the water level with respect to different body parts, namely ankle,
knee, hip, and chest. Lastly, locations of the Tweets are used for generating a map of estimated flood
extent and severity. This process was applied to an image dataset collected during Hurricane Harvey
in 2017, as a proof of concept. The results show that VGI can be used as a supplement to remote sensing
observations for flood extent mapping and is beneficial, especially for urban areas, where the
infrastructure is often occluding water. Based on the extracted water level information, an integrated
overview of flood severity can be provided for the early stages of emergency response.

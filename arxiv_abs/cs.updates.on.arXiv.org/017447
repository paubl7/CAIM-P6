To boost the object grabbing capability of underwater robots for open-sea farming, we propose a
new dataset (UDD) consisting of three categories (seacucumber, seaurchin, and scallop) with 2,227
images. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first 4K HD dataset collected in a real open-sea farm.
We also propose a novel Poisson-blending Generative Adversarial Network (Poisson GAN) and an efficient
object detection network (AquaNet) to address two common issues within related datasets: the class-imbalance
problem and the problem of mass small object, respectively. Specifically, Poisson GAN combines
Poisson blending into its generator and employs a new loss called Dual Restriction loss (DR loss),
which supervises both implicit space features and image-level features during training to generate
more realistic images. By utilizing Poisson GAN, objects of minority class like seacucumber or
scallop could be added into an image naturally and annotated automatically, which could increase
the loss of minority classes during training detectors to eliminate the class-imbalance problem;
AquaNet is a high-efficiency detector to address the problem of detecting mass small objects from
cloudy underwater pictures. Within it, we design two efficient components: a depth-wise-convolution-based
Multi-scale Contextual Features Fusion (MFF) block and a Multi-scale Blursampling (MBP) module
to reduce the parameters of the network to 1.3 million. Both two components could provide multi-scale
features of small objects under a short backbone configuration without any loss of accuracy. In
addition, we construct a large-scale augmented dataset (AUDD) and a pre-training dataset via Poisson
GAN from UDD. Extensive experiments show the effectiveness of the proposed Poisson GAN, AquaNet,
UDD, AUDD, and pre-training dataset.

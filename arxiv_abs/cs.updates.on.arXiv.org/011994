Random directed graphs $D(n,p)$ undergo a phase transition around the point $p = 1/n$, and the width
of the transition window has been known since the works of Luczak and Seierstad. They have established
that as $n \to \infty$ when $p = (1 + \mu n^{-1/3})/n$, the asymptotic probability that the strongly
connected components of a random directed graph are only cycles and single vertices decreases from
1 to 0 as $\mu$ goes from $-\infty$ to $\infty$. By using techniques from analytic combinatorics,
we establish the exact limiting value of this probability as a function of $\mu$ and provide more
properties of the structure of a random digraph around, below and above its transition point. We
obtain the limiting probability that a random digraph is acyclic and the probability that it has
one strongly connected complex component with a given difference between the number of edges and
vertices (called excess). Our result can be extended to the case of several complex components with
given excesses as well in the whole range of sparse digraphs. Our study is based on a general symbolic
method which can deal with a great variety of possible digraph families, and a version of the saddle-point
method which can be systematically applied to the complex contour integrals appearing from the
symbolic method. While the technically easiest model is the model of random multidigraphs, in which
multiple edges are allowed, and where edge multiplicities are sampled independently according
to a Poisson distribution with a fixed parameter $p$, we also show how to systematically approach
the family of simple digraphs, where multiple edges are forbidden, and where 2-cycles are either
allowed or not. Our theoretical predictions are supported by numerical simulations, and we provide
tables of numerical values for the integrals of Airy functions that appear in this study.

Regulatory radio spectrum management is evolving from traditional static frequency allocation
and assignment schemes towards dynamic spectrum management and access schemes. This evolution
is necessitated by a number of factors including underutilization of licensed spectrum bands,
changing market and technological developments and increased demand for spectrum for emerging
applications in multimedia communications, internet-of-things and fifth generation (5G) wireless
networks. In simple terms dynamic spectrum management involves allowing unlicensed users known
as secondary users (SUs) to access the licensed spectrum of a licensed user also known as primary
user (PU). This is primarily achieved using spectrum sharing schemes that leverage spectrum database
and cognitive radio techniques. However, the use of spectrum database and cognitive radio techniques
faces reliability, security and privacy concerns for spectrum sharing. There is also a need to support
other requirements of dynamic spectrum management such as secondary spectrum trading market and
dynamic spectrum access coordination. In this work, we review the use of blockchains for enabling
spectrum sharing and other aspects of dynamic spectrum management. The review covers the use of
blockchain to record spectrum management information such as spectrum sensing results and spectrum
auction transactions in a secure manner. The article also covers the use of smart contracts to support
complex service-levelagreements (SLAs) between network operators which is key to supporting
a self-organized secondary spectrum sharing market and enforcement of regulatory policies. A
taxonomy of the intersection between blockchain and various concepts of dynamic spectrum management
is also provided

Code comments are important for program comprehension, development, and maintenance tasks. Given
the varying standards for code comments, and their unstructured or semi-structured nature, developers
get easily confused (especially novice developers) about which convention(s) to follow, or what
tools to use while writing code documentation. Thus, they post related questions on external online
sources to seek better commenting practices. In this paper, we analyze code comment discussions
on online sources such as Stack Overflow (SO) and Quora to shed some light on the questions developers
ask about commenting practices. We apply Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify emerging
topics concerning code comments. Then we manually analyze a statistically significant sample
set of posts to derive a taxonomy that provides an overview of the developer questions about commenting
practices. Our results highlight that on SO nearly 40% of the questions mention how to write or process
comments in documentation tools and environments, and nearly 20% of the questions are about potential
limitations and possibilities of documentation tools to add automatically and consistently more
information in comments. On the other hand, on Quora, developer questions focus more on background
information (35% of the questions) or asking opinions (16% of the questions) about code comments.
We found that (i) not all aspects of comments are covered in coding style guidelines, e.g., how to
add a specific type of information, (ii) developers need support in learning the syntax and format
conventions to add various types of information in comments, and (iii) developers are interested
in various automated strategies for comments such as detection of bad comments, or verify comment
style automatically, but lack tool support to do that.

Providing care for ageing populations is an onerous task, and as life expectancy estimates continue
to rise, the number of people that require senior care is growing rapidly. This paper proposes a methodology
based on Transformer Neural Networks to classify the activities of a resident within an ambient
sensor based environment. We also propose a methodology to pre-train Transformers in a self-supervised
manner, as a hybrid autoencoder-classifier model instead of using contrastive loss. The social
impact of the research is considered with wider benefits of the approach and next steps for identifying
transitions in human behaviour. In recent years there has been an increasing drive for integrating
sensor based technologies within care facilities for data collection. This allows for employing
machine learning for many aspects including activity recognition and anomaly detection. Due to
the sensitivity of healthcare environments, some methods of data collection used in current research
are considered to be intrusive within the senior care industry, including cameras for image based
activity recognition, and wearables for activity tracking, but recent studies have shown that
using these methods commonly result in poor data quality due to the lack of resident interest in participating
in data gathering. This has led to a focus on ambient sensors, such as binary PIR motion, connected
domestic appliances, and electricity and water metering. By having consistency in ambient data
collection, the quality of data is considerably more reliable, presenting the opportunity to perform
classification with enhanced accuracy. Therefore, in this research we looked to find an optimal
way of using deep learning to classify human activity with ambient sensor data.

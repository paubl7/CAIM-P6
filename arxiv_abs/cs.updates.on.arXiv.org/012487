Platforms such as Stack Overflow are available for software practitioners to solicit solutions
to their challenges and knowledge needs. The practices therein have in recent times however triggered
quality related concerns. This is a noteworthy issue when considering that the Stack Overflow platform
is used by numerous software developers. Academic research tends to provide validation for the
practices and processes employed by Stack Overflow and other such forums. However, previous work
did not review the scale of scientific attention that is given to this cause. Continuing from our
preliminary work, we conducted a Systematic Mapping study involving 265 papers from six relevant
databases to address this gap. In this work, we explored the level of academic interest Stack Overflow
has generated, the publication venues that are targeted, the topics that are studied, approaches
used, types of contributions and the quality of the publications that are written about Stack Overflow.
Outcomes show that Stack Overflow has attracted increasing research interest over the years, with
topics relating to both community dynamics and human factors, and technical issues. In addition,
research studies have been largely evaluative or proposed solutions; however, the latter approach
tends to lack validation. The contributions of these studies are often techniques or answers to
a specific problem. Evaluating the quality of all studies that were dedicated to software programming
(58 papers), our outcomes show that on average only 58% of the developed quality criteria were met.
Notwithstanding that research is continually aiming to understand Stack Overflow and other similar
communities, further investigations are required to validate such studies and the solutions they
propose.

Depth information available from an RGB-D camera can be useful in segmenting salient objects when
figure/ground cues from RGB channels are weak. This has motivated the development of several RGB-D
saliency datasets and algorithms that use all four channels of the RGB-D data for both training and
inference. Unfortunately, existing RGB-D saliency datasets are small, which may lead to overfitting
and limited generalization for diverse scenarios. Here we propose a semi-supervised system for
RGB-D saliency detection that can be trained on smaller RGB-D saliency datasets without saliency
ground truth, while also make effective joint use of a large RGB saliency dataset with saliency ground
truth together. To generalize our method on RGB-D saliency datasets, a novel prediction-guided
cross-refinement module which jointly estimates both saliency and depth by mutual refinement
between two respective tasks, and an adversarial learning approach are employed. Critically,
our system does not require saliency ground-truth for the RGB-D datasets, which saves the massive
human labor for hand labeling, and does not require the depth data for inference, allowing the method
to be used for the much broader range of applications where only RGB data are available. Evaluation
on seven RGB-D datasets demonstrates that even without saliency ground truth for RGB-D datasets
and using only the RGB data of RGB-D datasets at inference, our semi-supervised system performs
favorable against state-of-the-art fully-supervised RGB-D saliency detection methods that
use saliency ground truth for RGB-D datasets at training and depth data at inference on two largest
testing datasets. Our approach also achieves comparable results on other popular RGB-D saliency
benchmarks.

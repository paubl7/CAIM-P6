Even though machine learning algorithms already play a significant role in data science, many current
methods pose unrealistic assumptions on input data. The application of such methods is difficult
due to incompatible data formats, or heterogeneous, hierarchical or entirely missing data fragments
in the dataset. As a solution, we propose a versatile, unified framework called `HMill' for sample
representation, model definition and training. We review in depth a multi-instance paradigm for
machine learning that the framework builds on and extends. To theoretically justify the design
of key components of HMill, we show an extension of the universal approximation theorem to the set
of all functions realized by models implemented in the framework. The text also contains a detailed
discussion on technicalities and performance improvements in our implementation, which is published
for download under the MIT License. The main asset of the framework is its flexibility, which makes
modelling of diverse real-world data sources with the same tool possible. Additionally to the standard
setting in which a set of attributes is observed for each object individually, we explain how message-passing
inference in graphs that represent whole systems of objects can be implemented in the framework.
To support our claims, we solve three different problems from the cybersecurity domain using the
framework. The first use case concerns IoT device identification from raw network observations.
In the second problem, we study how malicious binary files can be classified using a snapshot of the
operating system represented as a directed graph. The last provided example is a task of domain blacklist
extension through modelling interactions between entities in the network. In all three problems,
the solution based on the proposed framework achieves performance comparable to specialized approaches.

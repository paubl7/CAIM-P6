Over 26 million cases have been confirmed worldwide (by 20 August 2020) since the Coronavirus disease
(COIVD_19) outbreak in December 2019. Research studies have been addressing diverse aspects in
relation to COVID_19 including potential symptoms, predictive tools and specifically, correlations
with various demographic attributes. However, very limited work is performed towards the modelling
of complex associations between the combined demographic attributes and varying nature of the
COVID_19 infections across the globe. Investigating the underlying disease associations with
the combined demographical characteristics might help in comprehensive analysis this devastating
disease as well as contribute to its effective management. In this study, we present an intelligent
model to investigate the multi-dimensional associations between the potentially relevant demographic
attributes and the COVID_19 severity levels across the globe. We gather multiple demographic attributes
and COVID_19 infection data (by 20 August 2020) from various reliable sources, which is then fed-into
pattern matching algorithms that include self-organizing maps, class association rules and statistical
approaches, to identify the significant associations within the processed dataset. Statistical
results and the experts report indicate strong associations between the COVID_19 severity levels
and measures of certain demographic attributes such as female smokers, when combined together
with other attributes. These results strongly suggest that the mechanism underlying COVID_19
infection severity is associated to distribution of the certain demographic attributes within
different regions of the world. The outcomes will aid the understanding of the dynamics of disease
spread and its progression that might in turn help the policy makers and the society, in better understanding
and management of the disease.

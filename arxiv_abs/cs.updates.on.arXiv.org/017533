A connected partition is a partition of the vertices of a graph into sets that induce connected subgraphs.
Such partitions naturally occur in many application areas such as road networks, and image processing.
We consider Balanced Connected Partitions (BCP), where the two classical objectives for BCP are
to maximize the weight of the smallest, or minimize the weight of the largest component. We study
BCP on c-claw-free graphs, the class of graphs that do not have $K_{1,c}$ as an induced subgraph,
and present efficient (c-1)-approximation algorithms for both objectives. In particular, due
to the (3-)claw-freeness of line graphs, this also implies a 2-approximations for the edge-partition
version of BCP in general graphs. In the 1970s Gy\H{o}ri and Lov\'{a}sz showed for natural numbers
$w_1,\dots,w_k$ where $\sum_i w_i$ is the vertex size, that if $G$ is k-connected, then there exist
a connected k-partition with part sizes $w_1,\dots,w_k$. However, to this day no polynomial algorithm
to compute such partitions exists for k>4. Towards finding such a partition $T_1,\dots, T_k$, we
show how to efficiently compute connected partitions that at least approximately meet the target
weights, subject to the mild assumption that each $w_i$ is greater than the weight of the heaviest
vertex. In particular, we give a 3-approximation for both the lower and the upper bounded version
i.e. we guarantee that each $T_i$ has weight at least $\frac{w_i}{3}$ or that each $T_i$ has weight
most $3w_i$, respectively. Also, we present a both-side bounded version that produces a connected
partition where each $T_i$ has size at least $\frac{w_i}{3}$ and at most $\max(\{r,3\}) w_i$, where
$r \geq 1$ is the ratio between the largest and smallest value in $w_1, \dots, w_k$. In particular
for the balanced version, i.e.~$w_1=w_2=, \dots,=w_k$, this gives a partition with $\frac{1}{3}w_i
\leq w(T_i) \leq 3w_i$.

One of the primary drivers for self-adaptation is ensuring that systems achieve their goals regardless
of the uncertainties they face during operation. Nevertheless, the concept of uncertainty in self-adaptive
systems is still insufficiently understood. Several taxonomies of uncertainty have been proposed,
and a substantial body of work exists on methods to tame uncertainty. Yet, these taxonomies and methods
do not fully convey the research community's perception on what constitutes uncertainty in self-adaptive
systems and how to tackle it. To understand this perception and learn from it, we conducted a survey
comprising two complementary stages. In the first stage, we focused on current research and development.
In the second stage, we focused on directions for future research. The key findings of the first stage
are: a) an overview of uncertainty sources considered in self-adaptive systems, b) an overview
of existing methods used to tackle uncertainty in concrete applications, c) insights into the impact
of uncertainty on non-functional requirements, d) insights into different opinions in the perception
of uncertainty within the community, and the need for standardised uncertainty-handling processes
to facilitate uncertainty management in self-adaptive systems. The key findings of the second
stage are: a) the insight that over 70% of the participants believe that self-adaptive systems can
be engineered to cope with unanticipated change, b) a set of potential approaches for dealing with
unanticipated change, c) a set of open challenges in mitigating uncertainty in self-adaptive systems,
in particular in those with safety-critical requirements. From these findings, we outline an initial
reference process to manage uncertainty in self-adaptive systems.

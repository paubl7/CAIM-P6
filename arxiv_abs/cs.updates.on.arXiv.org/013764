Passive environment assisted communication takes place via a quantum channel modeled as a unitary
interaction between the information carrying system and an environment, where the latter is controlled
by a passive helper, who can set its initial state such as to assist sender and receiver, but not help
actively by adjusting her behaviour depending on the message. Here we investigate the information
transmission capabilities in this framework by considering Gaussian unitaries acting on Bosonic
systems. We consider both quantum communication and classical communication with helper, as well
as classical communication with free classical coordination between sender and helper (conferencing
encoders). Concerning quantum communication, we prove general coding theorems with and without
energy constraints, yielding multi-letter (regularized) expressions. In the search for cases
where the capacity formula is computable, we look for Gaussian unitaries that are universally degradable
or anti-degradable. However, we show that no Gaussian unitary yields either a degradable or anti-degradable
channel for all environment states. On the other hand, restricting to Gaussian environment states,
results in universally degradable unitaries, for which we thus can give single-letter quantum
capacity formulas. Concerning classical communication, we prove a general coding theorem for
the classical capacity under and energy constraint, given by a multi-letter expression. Furthermore,
we derive an uncertainty-type relation between the classical capacities of the sender and the helper,
helped respectively by the other party, showing a lower bound on the sum of the two capacities. Then,
this is used to lower bound the classical information transmission rate in the scenario of classical
communication between sender and helper.

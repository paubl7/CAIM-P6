Autonomous experimentation enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) offers a new paradigm for
accelerating scientific discovery. Non-equilibrium materials synthesis is emblematic of complex,
resource-intensive experimentation whose acceleration would be a watershed for materials discovery
and development. The mapping of non-equilibrium synthesis phase diagrams has recently been accelerated
via high throughput experimentation but still limits materials research because the parameter
space is too vast to be exhaustively explored. We demonstrate accelerated synthesis and exploration
of metastable materials through hierarchical autonomous experimentation governed by the Scientific
Autonomous Reasoning Agent (SARA). SARA integrates robotic materials synthesis and characterization
along with a hierarchy of AI methods that efficiently reveal the structure of processing phase diagrams.
SARA designs lateral gradient laser spike annealing (lg-LSA) experiments for parallel materials
synthesis and employs optical spectroscopy to rapidly identify phase transitions. Efficient
exploration of the multi-dimensional parameter space is achieved with nested active learning
(AL) cycles built upon advanced machine learning models that incorporate the underlying physics
of the experiments as well as end-to-end uncertainty quantification. With this, and the coordination
of AL at multiple scales, SARA embodies AI harnessing of complex scientific tasks. We demonstrate
its performance by autonomously mapping synthesis phase boundaries for the Bi$_2$O$_3$ system,
leading to orders-of-magnitude acceleration in establishment of a synthesis phase diagram that
includes conditions for kinetically stabilizing $\delta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$ at room temperature,
a critical development for electrochemical technologies such as solid oxide fuel cells.

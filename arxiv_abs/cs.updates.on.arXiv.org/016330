Scientific workflows are a cornerstone of modern scientific computing. They are used to describe
complex computational applications that require efficient and robust management of large volumes
of data, which are typically stored/processed on heterogeneous, distributed resources. The workflow
research and development community has employed a number of methods for the quantitative evaluation
of existing and novel workflow algorithms and systems. In particular, a common approach is to simulate
workflow executions. In previous works, we have presented a collection of tools that have been adopted
by the community for conducting workflow research. Despite their popularity, they suffer from
several shortcomings that prevent easy adoption, maintenance, and consistency with the evolving
structures and computational requirements of production workflows. In this work, we present WfCommons,
a framework that provides a collection of tools for analyzing workflow executions, for producing
generators of synthetic workflows, and for simulating workflow executions. We demonstrate the
realism of the generated synthetic workflows by comparing their simulated executions to real workflow
executions. We also contrast these results with results obtained when using the previously available
collection of tools. We find that the workflow generators that are automatically constructed by
our framework not only generate representative same-scale workflows (i.e., with structures and
task characteristics distributions that resemble those observed in real-world workflows), but
also do so at scales larger than that of available real-world workflows. Finally, we conduct a case
study to demonstrate the usefulness of our framework for estimating the energy consumption of large-scale
workflow executions.

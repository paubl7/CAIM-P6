This paper presents a novel First Order Plus Fractional Diffusive Delay (FOPFDD) model, capable
of modeling delay dominant systems with high accuracy. The novelty of the FOPFDD is the Fractional
Diffusive Delay (FDD) term, an exponential delay of non-integer order $\alpha$, i.e. $e^{-(Ls)^{\alpha}}$
in Laplace domain. The special cases of $\alpha = 0.5$ and $\alpha = 1$ have already been investigated
thoroughly. In this work $\alpha$ is generalized to any real number in the interval $]0,1[$. For
$\alpha=0.5$, this term appears in the solution of distributed diffusion systems, which will serve
as a source of inspiration for this work. Both frequency and time domain are investigated. However,
regarding the latter, no closed-form expression of the inverse Laplace transform of the FDD can
be found for all $\alpha$, so numerical tools are used to obtain an impulse response of the FDD. To
establish the algorithm, several properties of the FDD term have been proven: firstly, existence
of the term, secondly, invariance of the time integral of the impulse response, and thirdly, dependency
of the impulse response's energy on $\alpha$. To conclude, the FOPFDD model is fitted to several
delay-dominant, diffusive-like resistors-capacitors (RC) circuits to show the increased modeling
accuracy compared to other state-of-the-art models found in literature. The FOPFDD model outperforms
the other approximation models in accurately tracking frequency response functions as well as
in mimicing the peculiar delay/diffusive-like time responses, coming from the interconnection
of a large number of discrete subsystems. The fractional character of the FOPFDD makes it an ideal
candidate for an approximate model to these large and complex systems with only a few parameters.

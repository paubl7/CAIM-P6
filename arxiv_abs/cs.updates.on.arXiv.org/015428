Deep learning based models have excelled in many computer vision tasks and appear to surpass humans'
performance. However, these models require an avalanche of expensive human labeled training data
and many iterations to train their large number of parameters. This severely limits their scalability
to the real-world long-tail distributed categories, some of which are with a large number of instances,
but with only a few manually annotated. Learning from such extremely limited labeled examples is
known as Few-shot learning (FSL). Different to prior arts that leverage meta-learning or data augmentation
strategies to alleviate this extremely data-scarce problem, this paper presents a statistical
approach, dubbed Instance Credibility Inference (ICI) to exploit the support of unlabeled instances
for few-shot visual recognition. Typically, we repurpose the self-taught learning paradigm to
predict pseudo-labels of unlabeled instances with an initial classifier trained from the few shot
and then select the most confident ones to augment the training set to re-train the classifier. This
is achieved by constructing a (Generalized) Linear Model (LM/GLM) with incidental parameters
to model the mapping from (un-)labeled features to their (pseudo-)labels, in which the sparsity
of the incidental parameters indicates the credibility of the corresponding pseudo-labeled instance.
We rank the credibility of pseudo-labeled instances along the regularization path of their corresponding
incidental parameters, and the most trustworthy pseudo-labeled examples are preserved as the
augmented labeled instances. Theoretically, under mild conditions of restricted eigenvalue,
irrepresentability, and large error, our approach is guaranteed to collect all the correctly-predicted
instances from the noisy pseudo-labeled set.

Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been the main agenda of the whole world, since it came into
sight in December 2019 as it has significantly affected the world economy and healthcare system.
Given the effects of COVID-19 on pulmonary tissues, chest radiographic imaging has become a necessity
for screening and monitoring the disease. Numerous studies have proposed Deep Learning approaches
for the automatic diagnosis of COVID-19. Although these methods achieved astonishing performance
in detection, they have used limited chest X-ray (CXR) repositories for evaluation, usually with
a few hundred COVID-19 CXR images only. Thus, such data scarcity prevents reliable evaluation with
the potential of overfitting. In addition, most studies showed no or limited capability in infection
localization and severity grading of COVID-19 pneumonia. In this study, we address this urgent
need by proposing a systematic and unified approach for lung segmentation and COVID-19 localization
with infection quantification from CXR images. To accomplish this, we have constructed the largest
benchmark dataset with 33,920 CXR images, including 11,956 COVID-19 samples, where the annotation
of ground-truth lung segmentation masks is performed on CXRs by a novel human-machine collaborative
approach. An extensive set of experiments was performed using the state-of-the-art segmentation
networks, U-Net, U-Net++, and Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN). The developed network, after an
extensive iterative process, reached a superior performance for lung region segmentation with
Intersection over Union (IoU) of 96.11% and Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 97.99%. Furthermore,
COVID-19 infections of various shapes and types were reliably localized with 83.05% IoU and 88.21%
DSC. Finally, the proposed approach has achieved an outstanding COVID-19 detection performance
with both sensitivity and specificity values above 99%.

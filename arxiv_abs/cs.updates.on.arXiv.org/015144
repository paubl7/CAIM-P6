Biomolecular electrostatics is key in protein function and the chemical processes affecting it.Implicit-solvent
models expressed by the Poisson-Boltzmann (PB) equation can provide insights with less computational
power than full atomistic models, making large-system studies -- at the scale of viruses, for example
-- accessible to more researchers. This paper presents a high-productivity and high-performance
computational workflow combining Exafmm, a fast multipole method (FMM) library, and Bempp, a Galerkin
boundary element method (BEM) package. It integrates an easy-to-use Python interface with well-optimized
computational kernels that are written in compiled languages. Researchers can run PB simulations
interactively via Jupyter notebooks, enabling faster prototyping and analyzing. We provide results
that showcase the capability of the software, confirm correctness, and evaluate its performance
with problem sizes between 8,000 and 2 million boundary elements. A study comparing two variants
of the boundary integral formulation in regards to algebraic conditioning showcases the power
of this interactive computing platform to give useful answers with just a few lines of code. As a form
of solution verification, mesh refinement studies with a spherical geometry as well as with a real
biological structure (5PTI) confirm convergence at the expected $1/N$ rate, for $N$ boundary elements.
Performance results include timings, breakdowns, and computational complexity. Exafmm offers
evaluation speeds of just a few seconds for tens of millions of points, and $\mathcal{O}(N)$ scaling.
This allowed computing the solvation free energy of a Zika virus, represented by 1.6 million atoms
and 10 million boundary elements, at 80-min runtime on a single compute node (dual 20-core Intel
Xeon Gold 6148). All results in the paper are presented with utmost care for reproducibility.

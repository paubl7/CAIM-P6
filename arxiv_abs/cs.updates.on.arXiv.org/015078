Specific testing solutions targeting blockchain-based software are gaining huge attention as
blockchain technologies are being increasingly incorporated into enterprise systems. As blockchain-based
software enters production systems, it is paramount to follow proper engineering practices, ensure
the required level of testing, and assess the readiness of the developed system. The existing research
aims at addressing the testing-related issues and challenges of engineering blockchain-based
software by providing suitable techniques and tools. However, like any emerging discipline, the
best practices and tools for testing blockchain-based systems are not yet sufficiently developed.
In this paper, we provide a comprehensive survey on the testing of Blockchain-based Applications
(BC-Apps). First, we provide a discussion on identified challenges that are associated with BCApp
testing. Second, we use a layered approach to discuss the state-of-the-art testing efforts in the
area of BC technologies. In particular, we present an overview of the existing testing tools and
techniques that provide testing solutions either for different components at various layers of
the BC-App stack or across the whole stack. Third, we provide a set of future research directions
based on the identified BC testing challenges and gaps in the literature review of existing testing
solutions for BC-Apps. Moreover, we reflect on the specificity of BC-based software development
procedure, which makes some of the existing tools or techniques inadequate, and call for the definition
of standardised testing procedures and techniques for BC-Apps. The aim of our study is to highlight
the importance of BC-based software testing and to pave the way for disciplined, testable, and verifiable
BC software development.

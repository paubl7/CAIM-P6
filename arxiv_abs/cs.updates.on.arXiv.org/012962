Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has been widely adopted in wireless systems due to its flexibility,
mobility, and agility. Nevertheless, a limited onboard battery greatly hinders UAV to prolong
the serving time from communication tasks that need a high power consumption in active RF communications.
Fortunately, caching and backscatter communication (BackCom) are appealing technology for energy
efficient communication systems. This motivates us to investigate a wireless communication network
with backscatter- and cache-assisted UAV technology. We assume a UAV with a cache memory is deployed
as a flying backscatter device (BD), term the UAV-enabled BD (UB), to relay the source's signals
to the destination. Besides, the UAV can harvest energy from the source's RF signals and then utilizes
it for backscattering information to the destination. In this context, we aim to maximize the total
throughput by jointly optimizing the dynamic time splitting (DTS) ratio, backscatter coefficient,
and the UB's trajectory with caching capability at the UB corresponding to linear energy harvesting
(LEH) and non-linear energy harvesting (NLEH) models. These formulations are troublesome to directly
solve since they are mixed-integer non-convex problems. To find solutions, we decompose the original
problem into three subproblems, whereas we first optimize the DTS ratio for a given backscatter
coefficient and UB's trajectory, followed by the backscatter coefficient optimization for a given
DTS ratio and UB's trajectory, and the UB's trajectory is finally optimized for a given DTS ratio
and backscatter coefficient. Finally, the intensive numerical results demonstrate that our proposed
schemes achieve significant throughput gain in comparison to the benchmark schemes.

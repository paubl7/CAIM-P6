Proof of Work (PoW) is a Sybil-deterrence security mechanism. It introduces an external cost to
a system by requiring computational effort to perform actions. However, since its inception, a
central challenge was to tune this cost. Initial designs for deterring spam email and DoS attacks
applied overhead equally to honest participants and attackers. Requiring too little effort did
not deter attacks, whereas too much encumbered honest participation. This might be the reason it
was never widely adopted. Nakamoto overcame this trade-off in Bitcoin by distinguishing desired
from malicious behavior and introducing internal rewards for the former. This solution gained
popularity in securing cryptocurrencies and using the virtual internally-minted tokens for rewards.
However, in existing blockchain protocols the internal rewards fund (almost) the same value of
external expenses. Thus, as the token value soars, so does the PoW expenditure. Bitcoin PoW, for
example, already expends as much electricity as Colombia or Switzerland. This amount of resource-guzzling
is unsustainable and hinders even wider adoption of these systems. In this work we present Hybrid
Expenditure Blockchain (HEB), a novel PoW mechanism. HEB is a generalization of Nakamoto's protocol
that enables tuning the external expenditure by introducing a complementary internal-expenditure
mechanism. Thus, for the first time, HEB decouples external expenditure from the reward value.
We show a practical parameter choice by which HEB requires significantly less external consumption
compare to Nakamoto's protocol, its resilience against rational attackers is similar, and it retains
the decentralized and permissionless nature of the system. Taking the Bitcoin ecosystem as an example,
HEB cuts the electricity consumption by half.

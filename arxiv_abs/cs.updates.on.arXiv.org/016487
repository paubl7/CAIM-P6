We present a multi-stage 3D computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) model for automated localization
of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in bi-parametric MR imaging (bpMRI). Deep attention
mechanisms drive its detection network, targeting salient structures and highly discriminative
feature dimensions across multiple resolutions. Its goal is to accurately identify csPCa lesions
from indolent cancer and the wide range of benign pathology that can afflict the prostate gland.
Simultaneously, a decoupled residual classifier is used to achieve consistent false positive
reduction, without sacrificing high sensitivity or computational efficiency. In order to guide
model generalization with domain-specific clinical knowledge, a probabilistic anatomical prior
is used to encode the spatial prevalence and zonal distinction of csPCa. Using a large dataset of
1950 prostate bpMRI paired with radiologically-estimated annotations, we hypothesize that such
CNN-based models can be trained to detect biopsy-confirmed malignancies in an independent cohort.
For 486 institutional testing scans, the 3D CAD system achieves 83.69$\pm$5.22% and 93.19$\pm$2.96%
detection sensitivity at 0.50 and 1.46 false positive(s) per patient, respectively, with 0.882$\pm$0.030
AUROC in patient-based diagnosis $-$significantly outperforming four state-of-the-art baseline
architectures (U-SEResNet, UNet++, nnU-Net, Attention U-Net) from recent literature. For 296
external biopsy-confirmed testing scans, the ensembled CAD system shares moderate agreement
with a consensus of expert radiologists (76.69%; $kappa$ $=$ 0.51$\pm$0.04) and independent pathologists
(81.08%; $kappa$ $=$ 0.56$\pm$0.06); demonstrating strong generalization to histologically-confirmed
csPCa diagnosis.

Overhead lines are generally used for electrical energy transmission. Also, XLPE underground
cable lines are generally used in the city center and the crowded areas to provide electrical safety,
so high voltage underground cable lines are used together with overhead line in the transmission
lines, and these lines are called as the mixed lines. The distance protection relays are used to determine
the impedance based fault location according to the current and voltage magnitudes in the transmission
lines. However, the fault location cannot be correctly detected in mixed transmission lines due
to different characteristic impedance per unit length because the characteristic impedance of
high voltage cable line is significantly different from overhead line. Thus, determinations of
the fault section and location with the distance protection relays are difficult in the mixed transmission
lines. In this study, 154 kV overhead transmission line and underground cable line are examined
as the mixed transmission line for the distance protection relays. Phase to ground faults are created
in the mixed transmission line, and overhead line section and underground cable section are simulated
by using PSCAD. The short circuit fault images are generated in the distance protection relay for
the overhead transmission line and underground cable transmission line faults. The images include
the RX impedance diagram of the fault, and the RX impedance diagram have been detected by applying
image processing steps. The regression methods are used for prediction of the fault location, and
the results of image processing are used as the input parameters for the training process of the regression
methods. The results of regression methods are compared to select the most suitable method at the
end of this study for forecasting of the fault location in transmission lines.

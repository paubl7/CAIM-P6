The literature manifests that schizophrenia is associated with alterations in brain network connectivity.
We investigate whether large-scale Extended Granger Causality (lsXGC) can capture such alterations
using resting-state fMRI data. Our method utilizes dimension reduction combined with the augmentation
of source time-series in a predictive time-series model for estimating directed causal relationships
among fMRI time-series. The lsXGC is a multivariate approach since it identifies the relationship
of the underlying dynamic system in the presence of all other time-series. Here lsXGC serves as a
biomarker for classifying schizophrenia patients from typical controls using a subset of 62 subjects
from the Centers of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) data repository. We use brain connections
estimated by lsXGC as features for classification. After feature extraction, we perform feature
selection by Kendall's tau rank correlation coefficient followed by classification using a support
vector machine. As a reference method, we compare our results with cross-correlation, typically
used in the literature as a standard measure of functional connectivity. We cross-validate 100
different training/test (90%/10%) data split to obtain mean accuracy and a mean Area Under the receiver
operating characteristic Curve (AUC) across all tested numbers of features for lsXGC. Our results
demonstrate a mean accuracy range of [0.767, 0.940] and a mean AUC range of [0.861, 0.983] for lsXGC.
The result of lsXGC is significantly higher than the results obtained with the cross-correlation,
namely mean accuracy of [0.721, 0.751] and mean AUC of [0.744, 0.860]. Our results suggest the applicability
of lsXGC as a potential biomarker for schizophrenia.

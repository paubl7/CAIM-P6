Next-basket recommendation considers the problem of recommending a set of items into the next basket
that users will purchase as a whole. In this paper, we develop a novel mixed model with preferences,
popularities and transitions (M2) for next-basket recommendation. This method explicitly models
three important factors in next-basket generation process: 1) users' general preferences, 2)
items' global popularities and 3) transition patterns among items. We also propose a simple encoder-decoder
based framework (ed-Trans) to better model the transition patterns among items. We compared M2
with 5 state-of-the-art next-basket recommendation methods on 4 public benchmark datasets. Our
experimental results demonstrate that M2 significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
on all the datasets, with an improvement as much as 19.0% at recall@5. We also compared M2 with these
baseline methods in recommending the second next and third next baskets. Our experimental results
demonstrate that M2 could consistently outperform the baseline methods in all these tasks, with
an improvement as much as 14.4% at recall@5. In addition, we conducted a comprehensive ablation
study to verify the effects of the different factors. The results show that learning all the factors
together could significantly improve the recommendation performance compared to learning each
of them alone. The results also show that ed-Trans in learning item transitions among baskets could
outperform recurrent neural network-based methods on the benchmark datasets, with an improvement
as much as 20.4% at recall@5. We also have a thorough discussion on various experimental protocols
and evaluation metrics for next-basket recommendation evaluation.

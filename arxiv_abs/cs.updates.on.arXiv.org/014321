DNN-based video analytics have empowered many new applications (e.g., automated retail). Meanwhile,
the proliferation of fog devices provides developers with more design options to improve performance
and save cost. To the best of our knowledge, this paper presents the first serverless system that
takes full advantage of the client-fog-cloud synergy to better serve the DNN-based video analytics.
Specifically, the system aims to achieve two goals: 1) Provide the optimal analytics results under
the constraints of lower bandwidth usage and shorter round-trip time (RTT) by judiciously managing
the computational and bandwidth resources deployed in the client, fog, and cloud environment.
2) Free developers from tedious administration and operation tasks, including DNN deployment,
cloud and fog's resource management. To this end, we implement a holistic cloud-fog system referred
to as VPaaS (Video-Platform-as-a-Service). VPaaS adopts serverless computing to enable developers
to build a video analytics pipeline by simply programming a set of functions (e.g., model inference),
which are then orchestrated to process videos through carefully designed modules. To save bandwidth
and reduce RTT, VPaaS provides a new video streaming protocol that only sends low-quality video
to the cloud. The state-of-the-art (SOTA) DNNs deployed at the cloud can identify regions of video
frames that need further processing at the fog ends. At the fog ends, misidentified labels in these
regions can be corrected using a light-weight DNN model. To address the data drift issues, we incorporate
limited human feedback into the system to verify the results and adopt incremental learning to improve
our system continuously. The evaluation demonstrates that VPaaS is superior to several SOTA systems:
it maintains high accuracy while reducing bandwidth usage by up to 21%, RTT by up to 62.5%, and cloud
monetary cost by up to 50%.

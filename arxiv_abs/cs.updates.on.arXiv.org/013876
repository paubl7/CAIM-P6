Despite the rapid growth of online shopping and research interest in the relationship between online
and in-store shopping, national-level modeling and investigation of the demand for online shopping
with a prediction focus remain limited in the literature. This paper differs from prior work and
leverages two recent releases of the U.S. National Household Travel Survey (NHTS) data for 2009
and 2017 to develop machine learning (ML) models, specifically gradient boosting machine (GBM),
for predicting household-level online shopping purchases. The NHTS data allow for not only conducting
nationwide investigation but also at the level of households, which is more appropriate than at
the individual level given the connected consumption and shopping needs of members in a household.
We follow a systematic procedure for model development including employing Recursive Feature
Elimination algorithm to select input variables (features) in order to reduce the risk of model
overfitting and increase model explainability. Extensive post-modeling investigation is conducted
in a comparative manner between 2009 and 2017, including quantifying the importance of each input
variable in predicting online shopping demand, and characterizing value-dependent relationships
between demand and the input variables. In doing so, two latest advances in machine learning techniques,
namely Shapley value-based feature importance and Accumulated Local Effects plots, are adopted
to overcome inherent drawbacks of the popular techniques in current ML modeling. The modeling and
investigation are performed both at the national level and for three of the largest cities (New York,
Los Angeles, and Houston). The models developed and insights gained can be used for online shopping-related
freight demand generation and may also be considered for evaluating the potential impact of relevant
policies on online shopping demand.

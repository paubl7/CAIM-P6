Situations in which no scientific consensus has been reached due to either insufficient, inconclusive
or contradicting findings place strain on governments and public organizations which are forced
to take action under circumstances of uncertainty. In this chapter, we focus on the case of COVID-19,
its effects on children and the public debate around the reopening of schools. The aim is to better
understand the relationship between policy interventions in the face of an uncertain and rapidly
changing knowledge landscape and the subsequent use of scientific information in public debates
related to the policy interventions. Our approach is to combine scientific information from journal
articles and preprints with their appearance in the popular media, including social media. First,
we provide a picture of the different scientific areas and approaches, by which the effects of COVID-19
on children are being studied. Second, we identify news media and social media attention around
the COVID-19 scientific output related to children and schools. We focus on policies and media responses
in three countries: Spain, South Africa and the Netherlands. These countries have followed very
different policy actions with regard to the reopening of schools and represent very different policy
approaches to the same problem. We analyse the activity in (social) media around the debate between
COVID-19, children and school closures by focusing on the use of references to scientific information
in the debate. Finally, we analyse the dominant topics that emerge in the news outlets and the online
debates. We draw attention to illustrative cases of miscommunication related to scientific output
and conclude the chapter by discussing how information from scientific publication, the media
and policy actions shape the public discussion in the context of a global health pandemic.

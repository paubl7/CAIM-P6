The subject matter of the article is a model of calculating the user similarity coefficients of the
recommendation systems. The goal is the development of the improved model of user similarity coefficients
calculation for recommendation systems to optimize the time of forming recommendation lists.
The tasks to be solved are: to investigate the probability of changing user preferences of a recommendation
system by comparing their similarity coefficients in time, to investigate which distribution
function describes the changes of similarity coefficients of users in time. The methods used are:
graph theory, probability theory, radioactivity theory, algorithm theory. Conclusions. In the
course of the researches, the model of user similarity coefficients calculating for the recommendation
systems has been improved. The model differs from the known ones in that it takes into account the
recalculation period of similarity coefficients for the individual user and average recalculation
period of similarity coefficients for all users of the system or a specific group of users. The software
has been developed, in which a series of experiments was conducted to test the effectiveness of the
developed method. The conducted experiments showed that the developed method in general increases
the quality of the recommendation system without significant fluctuations of Precision and Recall
of the system. Precision and Recall can decrease slightly or increase, depending on the characteristics
of the incoming data set. The use of the proposed solutions will increase the application period
of the previously calculated similarity coefficients of users for the prediction of preferences
without their recalculation and, accordingly, it will shorten the time of formation and issuance
of recommendation lists up to 2 times.

An innumerable number of individual choices go into discovering a new book. There are unmistakably
two groups of booklovers: those who like to search online, follow other people's latest readings,
or simply react to a system's recommendations; and those who love to wander between library stacks,
lose themselves behind bookstore shelves, or simply hide behind piles of (un)organized books.
Depending on which group a person may fall into, there are two distinct and corresponding mediums
that inform his or her choices: digital, that provides efficient retrieval of information online,
and physical, a more tactile pursuit that leads to unexpected discoveries and promotes serendipity.
How could we possibly bridge the gap between these seemingly disparate mediums into an integrated
system that can amplify the benefits they both offer? In this paper, we present the BookVIS application,
which uses book-related data and generates personalized visualizations to follow users in their
quest for a new book. In this new redesigned version, the app brings associative visual connections
to support intuitive exploration of easily retrieved digital information and its relationship
with the physical book in hand. BookVIS keeps track of the user's reading preferences and generates
a dataSelfie as an individual snapshot of a personal taste that grows over time. Usability testing
has also been conducted and has demonstrated the app's ability to identify distinguishable patterns
in readers' tastes that could be further used to communicate personal preferences in new "shelf-browsing"
iterations. By efficiently supplementing the user's cognitive information needs while still
supporting the spontaneity and enjoyment of the book browsing experience, BookVIS bridges the
gap between real and online realms, and maximizes the engagement of personalized mobile visual
clues.

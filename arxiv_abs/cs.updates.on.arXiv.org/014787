In real-world applications, images may be not only sub-sampled but also heavily compressed thus
often containing various artifacts. Simple methods for enhancing the resolution of such images
will exacerbate the artifacts, rendering them visually objectionable. In spite of its high practical
values, super-resolving compressed images is not well studied in the literature. In this paper,
we propose a novel compressed image super resolution (CISR) framework based on parallel and series
integration of artifact removal and resolution enhancement. Based on maximum a posterior inference
for estimating a clean low-resolution (LR) input image and a clean high resolution (HR) output image
from down-sampled and compressed observations, we have designed a CISR architecture consisting
of two deep neural network modules: the artifact reduction module (ARM) and resolution enhancement
module (REM). ARM and REM work in parallel with both taking the compressed LR image as their inputs,
while they also work in series with REM taking the output of ARM as one of its inputs and ARM taking the
output of REM as its other input. A unique property of our CSIR system is that a single trained model
is able to super-resolve LR images compressed by different methods to various qualities. This is
achieved by exploiting deep neural net-works capacity for handling image degradations, and the
parallel and series connections between ARM and REM to reduce the dependency on specific degradations.
ARM and REM are trained simultaneously by the deep unfolding technique. Experiments are conducted
on a mixture of JPEG and WebP compressed images without a priori knowledge of the compression type
and com-pression factor. Visual and quantitative comparisons demonstrate the superiority of
our method over state-of-the-art super resolu-tion methods.

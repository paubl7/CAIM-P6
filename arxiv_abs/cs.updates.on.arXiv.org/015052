Along with rich health-related metadata, an ongoing imaging study has acquired MRI of over 40,000
male and female UK Biobank participants aged 44-82 since 2014. Phenotypes derived from these images,
such as measurements of body composition, can reveal new links between genetics, cardiovascular
disease, and metabolic conditions. In this retrospective study, six measurements of body composition
were automatically estimated by ResNet50 neural networks for image-based regression from neck-to-knee
body MRI. Despite the potential for high speed and accuracy, these networks produce no output segmentations
that could indicate the reliability of individual measurements. The presented experiments therefore
examine mean-variance regression and ensembling for predictive uncertainty estimation, which
can quantify individual measurement errors and thereby help to identify potential outliers, anomalies,
and other failure cases automatically. In 10-fold cross-validation on data of about 8,500 subjects,
mean-variance regression and ensembling showed complementary benefits, reducing the mean absolute
error across all predictions by 12%. Both improved the calibration of uncertainties and their ability
to identify high prediction errors. With intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) above 0.97,
all targets except the liver fat content yielded relative measurement errors below 5%. Testing
on another 1,000 subjects showed consistent performance, and the method was finally deployed for
inference to 30,000 subjects with missing reference values. The results indicate that deep regression
ensembles could ultimately provide automated, uncertainty-aware measurements of body composition
for more than 120,000 UK Biobank neck-to-knee body MRI that are to be acquired within the coming years.

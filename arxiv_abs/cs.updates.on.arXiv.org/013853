Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) is a highly prevalent but inconspicuous disease that seriously jeopardizes
the health of human beings. Polysomnography (PSG), the gold standard of detecting OSA, requires
multiple specialized sensors for signal collection, hence patients have to physically visit hospitals
and bear the costly treatment for a single detection. Recently, many single-sensor alternatives
have been proposed to improve the cost efficiency and convenience. Among these methods, solutions
based on RR-interval (i.e., the interval between two consecutive pulses) signals reach a satisfactory
balance among comfort, portability and detection accuracy. In this paper, we advance RR-interval
based OSA detection by considering its real-world practicality from energy perspectives. As photoplethysmogram
(PPG) pulse sensors are commonly equipped on smart wrist-worn wearable devices (e.g., smart watches
and wristbands), the energy efficiency of the detection model is crucial to fully support an overnight
observation on patients. This creates challenges as the PPG sensors are unable to keep collecting
continuous signals due to the limited battery capacity on smart wrist-worn devices. Therefore,
we propose a novel Frequency Extraction Network (FENet), which can extract features from different
frequency bands of the input RR-interval signals and generate continuous detection results with
downsampled, discontinuous RR-interval signals. With the help of the one-to-multiple structure,
FENet requires only one-third of the operation time of the PPG sensor, thus sharply cutting down
the energy consumption and enabling overnight diagnosis. Experimental results on real OSA datasets
reveal the state-of-the-art performance of FENet.

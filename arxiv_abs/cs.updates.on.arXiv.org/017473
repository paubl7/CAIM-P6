Prior measurement studies on browser fingerprinting have unfortunately largely excluded Web
Audio API-based fingerprinting in their analysis. We address this issue by conducting the first
systematic study of effectiveness of web audio fingerprinting mechanisms. We focus on studying
the feasibility and diversity properties of web audio fingerprinting. Along with 3 known audio
fingerprinting vectors, we designed and implemented 4 new audio fingerprint vectors that work
by obtaining FFTs of waveforms generated via different methods. Our study analyzed audio fingerprints
from 2093 web users and presents new insights into the nature of Web Audio fingerprints. First, we
show that audio fingeprinting vectors, unlike other prior vectors, reveal an apparent fickleness
with some users' browsers giving away differing fingerprints in repeated attempts. However, we
show that it is possible to devise a graph-based analysis mechanism to collectively consider all
the different fingerprints of users and thus craft a stable fingerprinting mechanism. Our analysis
also shows that it is possible to do this in a timely fashion. Next, we investigate the diversity of
audio fingerprints and compare this with prior techniques. Our results show that audio fingerprints
are much less diverse than other vectors with only 95 distinct fingerprints among 2093 users. At
the same time, further analysis shows that web audio fingerprinting can potentially bring considerable
additive value (in terms of entropy) to existing fingerprinting mechanisms. We also show that our
results contradict the current security and privacy recommendations provided by W3C regarding
audio fingerprinting. Overall, our systematic study allows browser developers to gauge the degree
of privacy invasion presented by audio fingerprinting thus helping them take a more informed stance
when designing privacy protection features in the future.

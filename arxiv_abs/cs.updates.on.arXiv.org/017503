Electrical energy consumption data accessibility for low voltage end users is one of the pillars
of smart grids. In some countries, despite the presence of smart meters, a fragmentary data availability
and/or the lack of standardization hinders the creation of post-metering value-added services
and confines such innovative solutions to the prototypal and experimental level. We take inspiration
from the technology adopted in Italy, where the national regulatory authority actively supported
the definition of a solution agreed upon by all the involved stakeholders. In this context, smart
meters are enabled to convey data to low voltage end users through a power line communication channel
(CHAIN 2) in near real-time. The aim of this paper is twofold. On the one hand, it describes the proof
of concept that the channel underwent and its subsequent validation (with performances nearing
99% success rate). On the other hand, it defines a classification framework (I2MA) for post-metering
value-added services, in order to categorize each use case based on both level of service and expected
benefits, and understand its maturity level. As an example, we apply the methodology to the 16 use
cases defined in Italy. The lessons learned from the regulatory, technological, and functional
approach of the Italian experience bring us to the provision of recommendations for researchers
and industry experts. In particular, we argue that a well-functioning post-metering value-added
services' market can flourish when: i) distribution system operators certify the measurements
coming from smart meters; ii) national regulatory authorities support the technological innovation
needed for setting up this market; and iii) service providers create customer-oriented solutions
based on smart meters' data.

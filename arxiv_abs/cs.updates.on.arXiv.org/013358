(Bi)orthogonal (multi)wavelets on the real line have been extensively studied and employed in
applications with success. A lot of problems in applications are defined on bounded intervals or
domains. Therefore, it is important in both theory and application to construct all possible wavelets
on intervals with some desired properties from (bi)orthogonal (multi)wavelets on the real line.
Vanishing moments of compactly supported wavelets are the key property for sparse wavelet representations
and are closely linked to polynomial reproduction of their underlying refinable (vector) functions.
Boundary wavelets with low order vanishing moments often lead to undesired boundary artifacts
as well as reduced sparsity and approximation orders near boundaries in applications. From any
arbitrarily given compactly supported (bi)orthogonal multiwavelet on the real line, in this paper
we propose two different approaches to construct/derive all possible locally supported (bi)orthogonal
(multi)wavelets on $[0,\infty)$ or $[0,1]$ with or without prescribed vanishing moments, polynomial
reproduction, and/or homogeneous boundary conditions. The first approach generalizes the classical
approach from scalar wavelets to multiwavelets, while the second approach is direct without explicitly
involving any dual refinable functions and dual multiwavelets. (Multi)wavelets on intervals
satisfying homogeneous boundary conditions will also be addressed. Though constructing orthogonal
(multi)wavelets on intervals is much easier than their biorthogonal counterparts, we show that
some boundary orthogonal wavelets cannot have any vanishing moments if these orthogonal (multi)wavelets
on intervals satisfy the homogeneous Dirichlet boundary condition. Several examples of orthogonal
and biorthogonal multiwavelets on the interval $[0,1]$ will be provided to illustrate our construction
approaches and proposed algorithms.

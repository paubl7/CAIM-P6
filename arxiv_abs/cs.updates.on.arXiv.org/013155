Literature-based discovery (LBD) aims to discover valuable latent relationships between disparate
sets of literatures. This paper presents the first inclusive scientometric overview of LBD research.
We utilize a comprehensive scientometric approach incorporating CiteSpace to systematically
analyze the literature on LBD from the last four decades (1986-2020). After manual cleaning, we
have retrieved a total of 409 documents from six bibliographic databases and two preprint servers.
The 35 years' history of LBD could be partitioned into three phases according to the published papers
per year: incubation (1986-2003), developing (2004-2008), and mature phase (2009-2020). The
annual production of publications follows Price's law. The co-authorship network exhibits many
subnetworks, indicating that LBD research is composed of many small and medium-sized groups with
little collaboration among them. Science mapping reveals that mainstream research in LBD has shifted
from baseline co-occurrence approaches to semantic-based methods at the beginning of the new millennium.
In the last decade, we can observe the leaning of LBD towards modern network science ideas. In an applied
sense, the LBD is increasingly used in predicting adverse drug reactions and drug repurposing.
Besides theoretical considerations, the researchers have put a lot of effort into the development
of Web-based LBD applications. Nowadays, LBD is becoming increasingly interdisciplinary and
involves methods from information science, scientometrics, and machine learning. Unfortunately,
LBD is mainly limited to the biomedical domain. The cascading citation expansion announces deep
learning and explainable artificial intelligence as emerging topics in LBD. The results indicate
that LBD is still growing and evolving.

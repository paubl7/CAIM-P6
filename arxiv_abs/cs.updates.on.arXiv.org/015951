Drug-induced parkinsonism affects many older adults with dementia, often causing gait disturbances.
New advances in vision-based human pose-estimation have opened possibilities for frequent and
unobtrusive analysis of gait in residential settings. This work proposes novel spatial-temporal
graph convolutional network (ST-GCN) architectures and training procedures to predict clinical
scores of parkinsonism in gait from video of individuals with dementia. We propose a two-stage training
approach consisting of a self-supervised pretraining stage that encourages the ST-GCN model to
learn about gait patterns before predicting clinical scores in the finetuning stage. The proposed
ST-GCN models are evaluated on joint trajectories extracted from video and are compared against
traditional (ordinal, linear, random forest) regression models and temporal convolutional network
baselines. Three 2D human pose-estimation libraries (OpenPose, Detectron, AlphaPose) and the
Microsoft Kinect (2D and 3D) are used to extract joint trajectories of 4787 natural walking bouts
from 53 older adults with dementia. A subset of 399 walks from 14 participants is annotated with scores
of parkinsonism severity on the gait criteria of the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS)
and the Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS). Our results demonstrate that ST-GCN models operating on 3D joint
trajectories extracted from the Kinect consistently outperform all other models and feature sets.
Prediction of parkinsonism scores in natural walking bouts of unseen participants remains a challenging
task, with the best models achieving macro-averaged F1-scores of 0.53 +/- 0.03 and 0.40 +/- 0.02
for UPDRS-gait and SAS-gait, respectively. Pre-trained model and demo code for this work is available:

The detection of nuclei and cells in histology images is of great value in both clinical practice
and pathological studies. However, multiple reasons such as morphological variations of nuclei
or cells make it a challenging task where conventional object detection methods cannot obtain satisfactory
performance in many cases. A detection task consists of two sub-tasks, classification and localization.
Under the condition of dense object detection, classification is a key to boost the detection performance.
Considering this, we propose similarity based region proposal networks (SRPN) for nuclei and cells
detection in histology images. In particular, a customized convolution layer termed as embedding
layer is designed for network building. The embedding layer is added into the region proposal networks,
enabling the networks to learn discriminative features based on similarity learning. Features
obtained by similarity learning can significantly boost the classification performance compared
to conventional methods. SRPN can be easily integrated into standard convolutional neural networks
architectures such as the Faster R-CNN and RetinaNet. We test the proposed approach on tasks of multi-organ
nuclei detection and signet ring cells detection in histological images. Experimental results
show that networks applying similarity learning achieved superior performance on both tasks when
compared to their counterparts. In particular, the proposed SRPN achieve state-of-the-art performance
on the MoNuSeg benchmark for nuclei segmentation and detection while compared to previous methods,
and on the signet ring cell detection benchmark when compared with baselines. The sourcecode is

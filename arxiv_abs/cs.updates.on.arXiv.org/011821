Affine registration of one or several brain image(s) onto a common reference space is a necessary
prerequisite for many image processing tasks, such as brain segmentation or functional analysis.
Manual assessment of registration quality is a tedious and time-consuming task, especially in
studies comprising a large amount of data. An automated and reliable quality control (QC) becomes
mandatory. Moreover, the computation time of the QC must be also compatible with the processing
of massive datasets. Therefore, an automated deep neural network approaches appear as a method
of choice to automatically assess registration quality. In the current study, a compact 3D convolutional
neural network (CNN), referred to as RegQCNET, is introduced to quantitatively predict the amplitude
of an affine registration mismatch between a registered image and a reference template. This quantitative
estimation of registration error is expressed using metric unit system. Therefore, a meaningful
task-specific threshold can be manually or automatically defined in order to distinguish usable
and non-usable images. The robustness of the proposed RegQCNET is first analyzed on lifespan brain
images undergoing various simulated spatial transformations and intensity variations between
training and testing. Secondly, the potential of RegQCNET to classify images as usable or non-usable
is evaluated using both manual and automatic thresholds. During our experiments, automatic thresholds
are estimated using several computer-assisted classification models through cross-validation.
To this end we used expert's visual quality control estimated on a lifespan cohort of 3953 brains.
Finally, the RegQCNET accuracy is compared to usual image features. Results show that the proposed
deep learning QC is robust, fast and accurate to estimate affine registration error in processing
pipeline.

In echocardiography (echo), an electrocardiogram (ECG) is conventionally used to temporally
align different cardiac views for assessing critical measurements. However, in emergencies or
point-of-care situations, acquiring an ECG is often not an option, hence motivating the need for
alternative temporal synchronization methods. Here, we propose Echo-SyncNet, a self-supervised
learning framework to synchronize various cross-sectional 2D echo series without any external
input. The proposed framework takes advantage of both intra-view and inter-view self supervisions.
The former relies on spatiotemporal patterns found between the frames of a single echo cine and the
latter on the interdependencies between multiple cines. The combined supervisions are used to
learn a feature-rich embedding space where multiple echo cines can be temporally synchronized.
We evaluate the framework with multiple experiments: 1) Using data from 998 patients, Echo-SyncNet
shows promising results for synchronizing Apical 2 chamber and Apical 4 chamber cardiac views;
2) Using data from 3070 patients, our experiments reveal that the learned representations of Echo-SyncNet
outperform a supervised deep learning method that is optimized for automatic detection of fine-grained
cardiac phase; 3) We show the usefulness of the learned representations in a one-shot learning scenario
of cardiac keyframe detection. Without any fine-tuning, keyframes in 1188 validation patient
studies are identified by synchronizing them with only one labeled reference study. We do not make
any prior assumption about what specific cardiac views are used for training and show that Echo-SyncNet
can accurately generalize to views not present in its training set. Project repository: github.com/fatemehtd/Echo-SyncNet.

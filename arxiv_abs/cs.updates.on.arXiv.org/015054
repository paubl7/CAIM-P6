Context: Technical Debt is a metaphor used to describe code that is "not quite right." Although TD
studies have gained momentum, TD has yet to be studied as thoroughly in non-Object-Oriented (OO)
or scientific software such as R. R is a multi-paradigm programming language, whose popularity
in data science and statistical applications has amplified in recent years. Due to R's inherent
ability to expand through user-contributed packages, several community-led organizations were
created to organize and peer-review packages in a concerted effort to increase their quality. Nonetheless,
it is well-known that most R users do not have a technical programming background, being from multiple
disciplines. Objective: The goal of this study is to investigate TD in the peer-review documentation
of R packages led by rOpenSci. Method: We collected over 5000 comments from 157 packages that had
been reviewed and approved to be published at rOpenSci. We manually analyzed a sample dataset of
these comments posted by package authors, editors of rOpenSci, and reviewers during the review
process to investigate the TD types present in these reviews. Results: The findings of our study
include (i) a taxonomy of TD derived from our analysis of the peer-reviews (ii) documentation debt
as being the most prevalent type of debt (iii) different user roles are concerned with different
types of TD. For instance, reviewers tend to report some TD types more than other roles, and the TD
types they report are different from those reported by the authors of a package. Conclusion: TD analysis
in scientific software or peer-review is almost non-existent. Our study is a pioneer but within
the context of R packages. However, our findings can serve as a starting point for replication studies,
given our public datasets, to perform similar analyses in other scientific software or to investigate
the rationale behind our findings.

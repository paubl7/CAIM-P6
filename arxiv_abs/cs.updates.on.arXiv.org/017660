Specifying a computational problem requires fixing encodings for input and output: encoding graphs
as adjacency matrices, characters as integers, integers as bit strings, and vice versa. For such
discrete data, the actual encoding is usually straightforward and/or complexity-theoretically
inessential (up to polynomial time, say); but concerning continuous data, already real numbers
naturally suggest various encodings (so-called REPRESENTATIONS) with very different properties,
ranging from the computably 'unreasonable' binary expansion via qualitatively to polynomially
and even linearly complexity-theoretically 'reasonable' signed-digit expansion. But how to
distinguish between un/suitable encodings of other spaces common in Calculus and Numerics, such
as Sobolev? With respect to qualitative computability, Kreitz and Weihrauch (1985) had identified
ADMISSIBILITY as crucial criterion for a representation over the Cantor space of infinite binary
sequences to be 'reasonable'; cmp. [doi:10.1007/11780342_48]. Refining computability over
topological to complexity over metric spaces, we develop the theory of POLYNOMIAL/LINEAR ADMISSIBILITY
as two quantitative refinements of qualitative admissibility. We also rephrase quantitative
admissibility as quantitative continuity of both the representation and of its set-valued inverse,
the latter adopting from [doi:10.4115/jla.2013.5.7] a new notion of 'sequential' continuity
for multifunctions. By establishing a quantitative continuous selection theorem for multifunctions
between compact ultrametric spaces, we can extend our above quantitative MAIN THEOREM from functions
to multifunctions aka search problems. Higher-type complexity is captured by generalizing Cantor's
(and Baire's) ground space for encodings to other (compact) ULRAmetric spaces.

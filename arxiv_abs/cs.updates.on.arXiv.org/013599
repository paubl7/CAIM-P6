Let $L$ be a set of $n$ lines in $R^3$ that is contained, when represented as points in the four-dimensional
Pl\"ucker space of lines in $R^3$, in an irreducible variety $T$ of constant degree which is \emph{non-degenerate}
with respect to $L$ (see below). We show: \medskip \noindent{\bf (1)} If $T$ is two-dimensional,
the number of $r$-rich points (points incident to at least $r$ lines of $L$) is $O(n^{4/3+\epsilon}/r^2)$,
for $r \ge 3$ and for any $\epsilon>0$, and, if at most $n^{1/3}$ lines of $L$ lie on any common regulus,
there are at most $O(n^{4/3+\epsilon})$ $2$-rich points. For $r$ larger than some sufficiently
large constant, the number of $r$-rich points is also $O(n/r)$. As an application, we deduce (with
an $\epsilon$-loss in the exponent) the bound obtained by Pach and de Zeeuw (2107) on the number of
distinct distances determined by $n$ points on an irreducible algebraic curve of constant degree
in the plane that is not a line nor a circle. \medskip \noindent{\bf (2)} If $T$ is two-dimensional,
the number of incidences between $L$ and a set of $m$ points in $R^3$ is $O(m+n)$. \medskip \noindent{\bf
(3)} If $T$ is three-dimensional and nonlinear, the number of incidences between $L$ and a set of
$m$ points in $R^3$ is $O\left(m^{3/5}n^{3/5} + (m^{11/15}n^{2/5} + m^{1/3}n^{2/3})s^{1/3}
+ m + n \right)$, provided that no plane contains more than $s$ of the points. When $s = O(\min\{n^{3/5}/m^{2/5},
m^{1/2}\})$, the bound becomes $O(m^{3/5}n^{3/5}+m+n)$. As an application, we prove that the
number of incidences between $m$ points and $n$ lines in $R^4$ contained in a quadratic hypersurface
(which does not contain a hyperplane) is $O(m^{3/5}n^{3/5} + m + n)$. The proofs use, in addition
to various tools from algebraic geometry, recent bounds on the number of incidences between points
and algebraic curves in the plane.

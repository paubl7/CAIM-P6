This study aimed to compare and investigate the efficacy of the real-world experiences, immersive
virtual reality (IVR) experiences, and video walkthrough representations on layout-learning
in a complex building. A quasi-experimental, intervention, and delayed post-test research design
was used among three groups: real-world, IVR, and video walkthrough representation. A total of
41 first-year design students from architecture, and game design departments were attended the
study. Design students were selected as they already know how to communicate graphically the layout
of a building on paper. IVR and video walkthrough groups experienced the representations of the
building by themselves, but real-world group experienced the building within a group as imitating
a design education field trip. After 10 days, a total of 26 participants out of 41 tested for spatial
recall performance. Recall performances were measured as an indicator of layout learning by analysing
the plan sketches drawn by the participants. Results showed IVR group recalled significantly more
spatial memories compared with the real-world and video walkthrough representation groups. Real-world
group performed the worst among three groups. This result was interpreted to three conclusions.
First, the layout learning tends to be overly sensitive to distractions and lower levels of distraction
may lead to better levels of layout learning. Second, for the domain of layout knowledge learning,
a remarkably simple IVR model is enough. Third, although real-world experiences give direct and
richer sensory information about the spaces, layout knowledge acquisition from the surrounding
environment requires psychologically active wayfinding decisions.

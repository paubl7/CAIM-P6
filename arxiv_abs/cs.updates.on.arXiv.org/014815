Context and Motivation: Software requirements are affected by the knowledge and confidence of
software engineers. Analyzing the interrelated impact of these factors is difficult because of
the challenges of assessing knowledge and confidence. Question/Problem: This research aims to
draw attention to the need for considering the interrelated effects of confidence and knowledge
on requirements quality, which has not been addressed by previous publications. Principal ideas/results:
For this purpose, the following steps have been taken: 1) requirements quality was defined based
on the instructions provided by the ISO29148:2011 standard, 2) we selected the symptoms of low qualified
requirements based on ISO29148:2011, 3) we analyzed five Software Requirements Specification
(SRS) documents to find these symptoms, 3) people who have prepared the documents were categorized
in four classes to specify the more/less knowledge and confidence they have regarding the symptoms,
and 4) finally, the relation of lack of enough knowledge and confidence to symptoms of low quality
was investigated. The results revealed that the simultaneous deficiency of confidence and knowledge
has more negative effects in comparison with a deficiency of knowledge or confidence. Contribution:
In brief, this study has achieved these results: 1) the realization that a combined lack of knowledge
and confidence has a larger effect on requirements quality than only one of the two factors, 2) the
relation between low qualified requirements and requirements engineers' needs for knowledge
and confidence, and 3) variety of requirements engineers' needs for knowledge based on their abilities
to make discriminative and consistent decisions.

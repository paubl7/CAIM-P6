Science advances by pushing the boundaries of the adjacent possible. While the global scientific
enterprise grows at an exponential pace, at the mesoscopic level the exploration and exploitation
of research ideas is reflected through the rise and fall of research fields. The empirical literature
has largely studied such dynamics on a case-by-case basis, with a focus on explaining how and why
communities of knowledge production evolve. Although fields rise and fall on different temporal
and population scales, they are generally argued to pass through a common set of evolutionary stages.
To understand the social processes that drive these stages beyond case studies, we need a way to quantify
and compare different fields on the same terms. In this paper we develop techniques for identifying
scale-invariant patterns in the evolution of scientific fields, and demonstrate their usefulness
using 1.5 million preprints from the arXiv repository covering 175 research fields spanning Physics,
Mathematics, Computer Science, Quantitative Biology and Quantitative Finance. We show that fields
consistently follows a rise and fall pattern captured by a two parameters right-tailed Gumbel temporal
distribution. We introduce a field-specific rescaled time and explore the generic properties
shared by articles and authors at the creation, adoption, peak, and decay evolutionary phases.
We find that the early phase of a field is characterized by the mixing of cognitively distant fields
by small teams of interdisciplinary authors, while late phases exhibit the role of specialized,
large teams building on the previous works in the field. This method provides foundations to quantitatively
explore the generic patterns underlying the evolution of research fields in science, with general
implications in innovation studies.

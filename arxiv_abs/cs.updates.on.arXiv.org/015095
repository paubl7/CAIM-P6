Contemporary business innovation relies increasingly on information and communications technology
(ICT) solutions. As ICT initiatives are generally implemented via projects the management of ICT
projects has come under increasing scrutiny. ICT projects continue to fail; as a result, while research
in ICT project management has indeed increased, many challenges for research and practice remain.
Many studies have addressed the execution and management of ICT projects and the many factors that
might relate to project outcomes. Very few, however, have considered ICT project initiation and
the crucial decisions made at that very early, pre-life cycle stage. The primary intent of this research
is therefore to investigate ICT projects with a particular focus on their initiation. In doing so
we wished to understand why ICT projects are started, and how they are moved from idea or proposal
to supported reality. A combination of semi-structured interviews and the repertory grid data
collection and analysis method was employed to investigate and validate the motivating factors
that influence individual IT Managers' project initiation decisions and the methods they use to
transition from idea to enacted project. Our results showed that there are indeed multiple underlying
reasons for the decisions made at this early stage and that there are some especially common decision
drivers. Some were expected, in the sense that they mapped to recommended best practice. For instance,
most projects are motivated by a desire to achieve efficiencies or cost savings, and their potential
tends to be assessed using cost benefit analysis. Other results were more surprising - competitor
pressure was not a common driver for ICT project initiation in our analysis. Unsurprisingly, formal
evaluation methods are more frequently used to assess project proposals when those projects are
larger and higher profile. (Abridged)

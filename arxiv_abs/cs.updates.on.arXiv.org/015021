With the introduction of new technologies such as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), high altitude
platforms (HAPS), millimeter wave (mmWave) frequencies, massive multiple-input multiple-output
(MIMO), and beamforming, wireless backhaul is expected to be an integral part of the 5G networks.
While this concept is nothing new, it was shortcoming in terms of performance compared to the fiber
backhauling. However, with these new technologies, fiber is no longer the foremost technology
for backhauling. With the projected densification of networks, wireless backhaul has become mandatory
to use. There are still challenges to be tackled if wireless backhaul is to be used efficiently. Resource
allocation, deployment, scheduling, power management and energy efficiency are some of these
problems. Wireless backhaul also acts as an enabler for new technologies and improves some of the
existing ones significantly. To name a few, rural connectivity, satellite communication, and
mobile edge computing are some concepts for which wireless backhauling acts as an enabler. Small
cell usage with wireless backhaul presents different security challenges. Governing bodies of
cellular networks have standardization efforts going on especially for the integrated access
and backhaul (IAB) concept, and this is briefly mentioned. Finally, wireless backhaul is also projected
to be an important part of the beyond 5G networks, and newly developed concepts such as cell-free
networking, ultra-massive MIMO, and extremely dense network show this trend as well. In this survey,
we present the aforementioned issues, challenges, opportunities, and applications of wireless
backhaul in 5G, while briefly mentioning concepts related to wireless backhaul beyond 5G alongside
with security and standardization issues.

Game developers cannot always meet the growing and changing needs of the gaming community, due to
the often already overloaded schedules of developers. So-called modders can potentially assist
game developers with addressing gamers' needs. Modders are enthusiasts who provide modifications
or completely new content for a game. By supporting modders, game developers can meet the rapidly
growing and varying needs of their gamer base. Modders have the potential to play a role in extending
the life expectancy of a game, thereby saving game developers time and money, and leading to a better
overall gaming experience for their gamer base. In this paper, we empirically study the metadata
of 9,521 mods of the 20 most-modded games on the Nexus Mods distribution platform. Our goal is to provide
useful insights into the modding community of the Nexus Mods distribution platform from a quantitative
perspective, and to provide researchers with a solid foundation for future exploration of game
mods. In doing so, game developers can potentially reduce development time and cost due to the increased
replayability of their games through mods. We find that providing official support for mods can
be beneficial for the perceived quality of the mods of a game. In addition, mod users are willing to
submit bug reports for a mod. However, they often fail to do this in a systematic manner using the bug
reporting tool of the Nexus Mods platform, resulting in low-quality bug reports which are difficult
to resolve. Based on our findings, we recommend that game developers who desire an active modding
community for their own games provide the modding community with an officially-supported modding
tool. In addition, we recommend that mod distribution platforms, such as Nexus Mods, improve their
bug reporting system to receive higher quality bug reports.

A predicate head is a verbal expression that plays a role as the structural center of a sentence. Identifying
predicate heads is critical to understanding a sentence. It plays the leading role in organizing
the relevant syntactic elements in a sentence, including subject elements, adverbial elements,
etc. For some languages, such as English, word morphologies are valuable for identifying predicate
heads. However, Chinese offers no morphological information to indicate words` grammatical roles.
A Chinese sentence often contains several verbal expressions; identifying the expression that
plays the role of the predicate head is not an easy task. Furthermore, Chinese sentences are inattentive
to structure and provide no delimitation between words. Therefore, identifying Chinese predicate
heads involves significant challenges. In Chinese information extraction, little work has been
performed in predicate head recognition. No generally accepted evaluation dataset supports work
in this important area. This paper presents the first attempt to develop an annotation guideline
for Chinese predicate heads and their relevant syntactic elements. This annotation guideline
emphasizes the role of the predicate as the structural center of a sentence. The design of relevant
syntactic element annotation also follows this principle. Many considerations are proposed to
achieve this goal, e.g., patterns of predicate heads, a flattened annotation structure, and a simpler
syntactic unit type. Based on the proposed annotation guideline, more than 1,500 documents were
manually annotated. The corpus will be available online for public access. With this guideline
and annotated corpus, our goal is to broadly impact and advance the research in the area of Chinese
information extraction and to provide the research community with a critical resource that has
been lacking for a long time.

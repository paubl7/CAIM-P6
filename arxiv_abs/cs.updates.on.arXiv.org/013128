Sentiment analysis of social media comments is very important for review analysis. Many online
reviews are sarcastic, humorous, or hateful. This sarcastic nature of these short texts change
the actual sentiments of the review as predicted by a machine learning model that attempts to detect
sentiment alone. Thus, having a model that is explicitly aware of these features should help it perform
better on reviews that are characterized by them. Several research has already been done in this
field. This paper deals with sarcasm detection on reddit comments. Several machine learning and
deep learning algorithms have been applied for the same but each of these models only take into account
the initial text instead of the conversation which serves as a better measure to determine sarcasm.
The other shortcoming these papers have is they rely on word embedding for representing comments
and thus do not take into account the problem of polysemy(A word can have multiple meanings based
on the context in which it appears). These existing modules were able to solve the problem of capturing
inter sentence contextual information but not the intra sentence contextual information. So we
propose a novel architecture which solves the problem of sarcasm detection by capturing intra sentence
contextual information using a novel contextual attention mechanism. The proposed model solves
the problem of polysemy also by using context enriched language modules like ELMO and BERT in its
first component. This model comprises a total of three major components which takes into account
inter sentence, intra sentence contextual information and at last use a convolutional neural network
for capturing global contextual information for sarcasm detection. The proposed model was able
to generate decent results and cleared showed potential to perform state of the art if trained on
a larger dataset.

Recently, segmentation methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) showed promising
performance in automatic Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions segmentation. These techniques have
even outperformed human experts in controlled evaluation conditions such as Longitudinal MS Lesion
Segmentation Challenge (ISBI Challenge). However state-of-the-art approaches trained to perform
well on highly-controlled datasets fail to generalize on clinical data from unseen datasets. Instead
of proposing another improvement of the segmentation accuracy, we propose a novel method robust
to domain shift and performing well on unseen datasets, called DeepLesionBrain (DLB). This generalization
property results from three main contributions. First, DLB is based on a large group of compact 3D
CNNs. This spatially distributed strategy ensures a robust prediction despite the risk of generalization
failure of some individual networks. Second, DLB includes a new image quality data augmentation
to reduce dependency to training data specificity (e.g., acquisition protocol). Finally, to learn
a more generalizable representation of MS lesions, we propose a hierarchical specialization learning
(HSL). HSL is performed by pre-training a generic network over the whole brain, before using its
weights as initialization to locally specialized networks. By this end, DLB learns both generic
features extracted at global image level and specific features extracted at local image level.
DLB generalization was validated in cross-dataset experiments on MSSEG'16, ISBI challenge, and
in-house datasets. During experiments, DLB showed higher segmentation accuracy, better segmentation
consistency and greater generalization performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. Therefore,
DLB offers a robust framework well-suited for clinical practice.

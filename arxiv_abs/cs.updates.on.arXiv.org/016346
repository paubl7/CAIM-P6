With the rise and ever-increasing potential of deep learning techniques in recent years, publicly
available medical datasets became a key factor to enable reproducible development of diagnostic
algorithms in the medical domain. Medical data contains sensitive patient-related information
and is therefore usually anonymized by removing patient identifiers, e.g., patient names before
publication. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to show that a well-trained deep learning
system is able to recover the patient identity from chest X-ray data. We demonstrate this using the
publicly available large-scale ChestX-ray14 dataset, a collection of 112,120 frontal-view chest
X-ray images from 30,805 unique patients. Our verification system is able to identify whether two
frontal chest X-ray images are from the same person with an AUC of 0.9940 and a classification accuracy
of 95.55%. We further highlight that the proposed system is able to reveal the same person even ten
and more years after the initial scan. When pursuing a retrieval approach, we observe an mAP@R of
0.9748 and a precision@1 of 0.9963. Furthermore, we achieve an AUC of up to 0.9870 and a precision@1
of up to 0.9444 when evaluating our trained networks on CheXpert and the COVID-19 Image Data Collection.
Based on this high identification rate, a potential attacker may leak patient-related information
and additionally cross-reference images to obtain more information. Thus, there is a great risk
of sensitive content falling into unauthorized hands or being disseminated against the will of
the concerned patients. Especially during the COVID-19 pandemic, numerous chest X-ray datasets
have been published to advance research. Therefore, such data may be vulnerable to potential attacks
by deep learning-based re-identification algorithms.

The global ambitions of a carbon-neutral society necessitate a stable and robust smart grid that
capitalises on frequency reserves of renewable energy. Frequency reserves are resources that
adjust power production or consumption in real time to react to a power grid frequency deviation.
Revenue generation motivates the availability of these resources for managing such deviations.
However, limited research has been conducted on data-driven decisions and optimal bidding strategies
for trading such capacities in multiple frequency reserves markets. We address this limitation
by making the following research contributions. Firstly, a generalised model is designed based
on an extensive study of critical characteristics of global frequency reserves markets. Secondly,
three bidding strategies are proposed, based on this market model, to capitalise on price peaks
in multi-stage markets. Two strategies are proposed for non-reschedulable loads, in which case
the bidding strategy aims to select the market with the highest anticipated price, and the third
bidding strategy focuses on rescheduling loads to hours on which highest reserve market prices
are anticipated. The third research contribution is an Artificial Intelligence (AI) based bidding
optimization framework that implements these three strategies, with novel uncertainty metrics
that supplement data-driven price prediction. Finally, the framework is evaluated empirically
using a case study of multiple frequency reserves markets in Finland. The results from this evaluation
confirm the effectiveness of the proposed bidding strategies and the AI-based bidding optimization
framework in terms of cumulative revenue generation, leading to an increased availability of frequency
reserves.

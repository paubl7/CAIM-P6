In online debates individual arguments support or attack each other, leading to some subset of arguments
being considered more relevant than others. However, in large discussions readers are often forced
to sample a subset of the arguments being put forth. Since such sampling is rarely done in a principled
manner, users may not read all the relevant arguments to get a full picture of the debate. This paper
is interested in answering the question of how users should sample online conversations to selectively
favour the currently justified or accepted positions in the debate. We apply techniques from argumentation
theory and complex networks to build a model that predicts the probabilities of the normatively
justified arguments given their location in online discussions. Our model shows that the proportion
of replies that are supportive, the number of replies that comments receive, and the locations of
un-replied comments all determine the probability that a comment is a justified argument. We show
that when the degree distribution of the number of replies is homogeneous along the discussion,
for acrimonious discussions, the distribution of justified arguments depends on the parity of
the graph level. In supportive discussions the probability of having justified comments increases
as one moves away from the root. For discussion trees that have a non-homogeneous in-degree distribution,
for supportive discussions we observe the same behaviour as before, while for acrimonious discussions
we cannot observe the same parity-based distribution. This is verified with data obtained from
the online debating platform Kialo. By predicting the locations of the justified arguments in reply
trees, we can suggest which arguments readers should sample to grasp the currently accepted opinions
in such discussions. Our models have important implications for the design of future online debating
platforms.

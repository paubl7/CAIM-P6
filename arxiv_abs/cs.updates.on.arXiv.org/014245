Although CNNs are widely considered as the state-of-the-art models in various applications of
image analysis, one of the main challenges still open is the training of a CNN on high resolution images.
Different strategies have been proposed involving either a rescaling of the image or an individual
processing of parts of the image. Such strategies cannot be applied to images, such as gigapixel
histopathological images, for which a high reduction in resolution inherently effects a loss of
discriminative information, and in respect of which the analysis of single parts of the image suffers
from a lack of global information or implies a high workload in terms of annotating the training images
in such a way as to select significant parts. We propose a method for the analysis of gigapixel histopathological
images solely by using weak image-level labels. In particular, two analysis tasks are taken into
account: a binary classification and a prediction of the tumor proliferation score. Our method
is based on a CNN structure consisting of a compressing path and a learning path. In the compressing
path, the gigapixel image is packed into a grid-based feature map by using a residual network devoted
to the feature extraction of each patch into which the image has been divided. In the learning path,
attention modules are applied to the grid-based feature map, taking into account spatial correlations
of neighboring patch features to find regions of interest, which are then used for the final whole
slide analysis. Our method integrates both global and local information, is flexible with regard
to the size of the input images and only requires weak image-level labels. Comparisons with different
methods of the state-of-the-art on two well known datasets, Camelyon16 and TUPAC16, have been made
to confirm the validity of the proposed model.

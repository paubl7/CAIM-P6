Photo-realistic neural reconstruction and rendering of the human portrait are critical for numerous
VR/AR applications. Still, existing solutions inherently rely on multi-view capture settings,
and the one-shot solution to get rid of the tedious multi-view synchronization and calibration
remains extremely challenging. In this paper, we propose MirrorNeRF - a one-shot neural portrait
free-viewpoint rendering approach using a catadioptric imaging system with multiple sphere mirrors
and a single high-resolution digital camera, which is the first to combine neural radiance field
with catadioptric imaging so as to enable one-shot photo-realistic human portrait reconstruction
and rendering, in a low-cost and casual capture setting. More specifically, we propose a light-weight
catadioptric system design with a sphere mirror array to enable diverse ray sampling in the continuous
3D space as well as an effective online calibration for the camera and the mirror array. Our catadioptric
imaging system can be easily deployed with a low budget and the casual capture ability for convenient
daily usages. We introduce a novel neural warping radiance field representation to learn a continuous
displacement field that implicitly compensates for the misalignment due to our flexible system
setting. We further propose a density regularization scheme to leverage the inherent geometry
information from the catadioptric data in a self-supervision manner, which not only improves the
training efficiency but also provides more effective density supervision for higher rendering
quality. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of our scheme to
achieve one-shot photo-realistic and high-quality appearance free-viewpoint rendering for
human portrait scenes.

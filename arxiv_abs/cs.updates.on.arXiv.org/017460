Given programming languages can provide different types and levels of security support, it is critically
important to consider security aspects while selecting programming languages for developing
software systems. Inadequate consideration of security in the choice of a programming language
may lead to potential ramifications for secure development. Whilst theoretical analysis of the
supposed security properties of different programming languages has been conducted, there has
been relatively little effort to empirically explore the actual security challenges experienced
by developers. We have performed a large-scale study of the security challenges of 15 programming
languages by quantitatively and qualitatively analysing the developers' discussions from Stack
Overflow and GitHub. By leveraging topic modelling, we have derived a taxonomy of 18 major security
challenges for 6 topic categories. We have also conducted comparative analysis to understand how
the identified challenges vary regarding the different programming languages and data sources.
Our findings suggest that the challenges and their characteristics differ substantially for different
programming languages and data sources, i.e., Stack Overflow and GitHub. The findings provide
evidence-based insights and understanding of security challenges related to different programming
languages to software professionals (i.e., practitioners or researchers). The reported taxonomy
of security challenges can assist both practitioners and researchers in better understanding
and traversing the secure development landscape. This study highlights the importance of the choice
of technology, e.g., programming language, in secure software engineering. Hence, the findings
are expected to motivate practitioners to consider the potential impact of the choice of programming
languages on software security.

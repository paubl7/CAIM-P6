This paper considers the problem of multi-server Private Linear Computation, under the joint and
individual privacy guarantees. In this problem, identical copies of a dataset comprised of $K$
messages are stored on $N$ non-colluding servers, and a user wishes to obtain one linear combination
of a $D$-subset of messages belonging to the dataset. The goal is to design a scheme for performing
the computation such that the total amount of information downloaded from the servers is minimized,
while the privacy of the $D$ messages required for the computation is protected. When joint privacy
is required, the identities of all of these $D$ messages must be kept private jointly, and when individual
privacy is required, the identity of every one of these $D$ messages must be kept private individually.
In this work, we characterize the capacity, which is defined as the maximum achievable download
rate, under both joint and individual privacy requirements. In particular, we show that the capacity
is given respectively by ${(1+1/N+\dots+1/N^{K-D})^{-1}}$ or ${(1+1/N+\dots+1/N^{\lceil
K/D\rceil-1})^{-1}}$ when joint or individual privacy is required. Our converse proofs are based
on reduction from two variants of the multi-server Private Information Retrieval problem in the
presence of side information. Our achievability schemes build up on our recently proposed schemes
for single-server Private Linear Transformation and the multi-server private computation scheme
proposed by Sun and Jafar. Using similar proof techniques, we also establish upper and lower bounds
on the capacity for the cases in which the user wants to compute $L$ (potentially more than one) linear
combinations. Specifically, we show that the capacity is upper and lower bounded respectively
by ${(1+1/N+\dots+1/N^{(K-D)/L})^{-1}}$ and ${(1+1/N+\dots+1/N^{K-D+L-1})^{-1}}$, when
joint privacy is required.

Understanding and keeping the customer happy is a central tenet of requirements engineering. Strategies
to gather, analyze, and negotiate requirements are complemented by efforts to manage customer
input after products have been deployed. For the latter, support tickets are key in allowing customers
to submit their issues, bug reports, and feature requests. If insufficient attention is given to
support issues, however, their escalation to management becomes time-consuming and expensive,
especially for large organizations managing hundreds of customers and thousands of support tickets.
Our work provides a step towards simplifying the job of support analysts and managers, particularly
in predicting the risk of escalating support tickets. In a field study at our large industrial partner,
IBM, we used a design science research methodology to characterize the support process and data
available to IBM analysts in managing escalations. We then implemented these features into a machine
learning model to predict support ticket escalations. We trained and evaluated our machine learning
model on over 2.5 million support tickets and 10,000 escalations, obtaining a recall of 87.36% and
an 88.23% reduction in the workload for support analysts looking to identify support tickets at
risk of escalation. Finally, in addition to these research evaluation activities, we compared
the performance of our support ticket model with that of a model developed with no feature engineering;
the support ticket model features outperformed the non-engineered model. The artifacts created
in this research are designed to serve as a starting place for organizations interested in predicting
support ticket escalations, and for future researchers to build on to advance research in escalation
prediction.

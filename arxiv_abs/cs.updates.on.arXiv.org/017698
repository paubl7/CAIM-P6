The aerodynamic optimization process of cars requires multiple iterations between aerodynamicists
and stylists. Response Surface Modeling and Reduced-Order Modeling are commonly used to eliminate
the overhead due to Computational Fluid Dynamics, leading to faster iterations. However, a primary
drawback of these models is that they can work only on the parametrized geometric features they were
trained with. This study evaluates if deep learning models can predict the drag coefficient for
an arbitrary input geometry without explicit parameterization. We use two similar data sets based
on the publicly available DrivAer geometry for training. We use a modified U-Net architecture that
uses Signed Distance Fields to represent the input geometries. Our models outperform the existing
models by at least 11% in prediction accuracy for the drag coefficient. We achieved this improvement
by combining multiple data sets that were created using different parameterizations, which is
not possible with the methods currently used. We have also shown that it is possible to predict velocity
fields and drag coefficient concurrently and that simple data augmentation methods can improve
the results. In addition, we have performed an occlusion sensitivity study on our models to understand
what information is used to make predictions. From the occlusion sensitivity study, we showed that
the models were able to identify the geometric features and have discovered that the model has learned
to exploit the global information present in the SDF. In contrast to the currently operational method,
where design changes are restricted to the initially defined parameters, this study brings surrogate
models one step closer to the long-term goal of having a model that can be used for approximate aerodynamic
evaluation of unseen, arbitrary vehicle shapes, thereby providing complete design freedom to
the vehicle stylists.

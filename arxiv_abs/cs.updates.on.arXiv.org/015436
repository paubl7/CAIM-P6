A dialogue is successful when there is alignment between the speakers, at different linguistic
levels. In this work, we consider the dialogue occurring between interlocutors engaged in a collaborative
learning task, and explore how performance and learning (i.e. task success) relate to dialogue
alignment processes. The main contribution of this work is to propose new measures to automatically
study alignment, to consider completely spontaneous spoken dialogues among children in the context
of a collaborative learning activity. Our measures of alignment consider the children's use of
expressions that are related to the task at hand, their follow-up actions of these expressions,
and how it links to task success. Focusing on expressions related to the task gives us insight into
the way children use (potentially unfamiliar) terminology related to the task. A first finding
of this work is the discovery that the measures we propose can capture elements of lexical alignment
in such a context. Through these measures, we find that teams with bad performance often aligned
too late in the dialogue to achieve task success, and that they were late to follow up each other's
instructions with actions. We also found that while interlocutors do not exhibit hesitation phenomena
(which we measure by looking at fillers) in introducing expressions pertaining to the task, they
do exhibit hesitation before accepting the expression, in the role of clarification. Lastly, we
show that information management markers (measured by the discourse marker 'oh') occur in the general
vicinity of the follow up actions from (automatically) inferred instructions. However, good performers
tend to have this marker closer to these actions. Our measures still reflect some fine-grained aspects
of learning in the dialogue, even if we cannot conclude that overall they are linked to the final measure
of learning.

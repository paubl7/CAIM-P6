For a caching system with multiple users, we aim to characterize the memory-rate tradeoff for caching
with uncoded cache placement, under nonuniform file popularity. Focusing on the modified coded
caching scheme (MCCS) recently proposed by Yu, etal., we formulate the cache placement optimization
problem for the MCCS to minimize the average delivery rate under nonuniform file popularity, restricting
to a class of popularity-first placements. We then present two information-theoretic lower bounds
on the average rate for caching with uncoded placement, one for general cache placements and the
other restricted to the popularity-first placements. By comparing the average rate of the optimized
MCCS with the lower bounds, we prove that the optimized MCCS attains the general lower bound for the
two-user case, providing the exact memory-rate tradeoff. Furthermore, it attains the popularity-first-based
lower bound for the case of general K users with distinct file requests. In these two cases, our results
also reveal that the popularity-first placement is optimal for the MCCS, and zero-padding used
in coded delivery incurs no loss of optimality. For the case of K users with redundant file requests,
our analysis shows that there may exist a gap between the optimized MCCS and the lower bounds due to
zero-padding. We next fully characterize the optimal popularity-first cache placement for the
MCCS, which is shown to possess a simple file-grouping structure and can be computed via an efficient
algorithm using closed-form expressions. Finally, we extend our study to accommodate both nonuniform
file popularity and sizes, where we show that the optimized MCCS attains the lower bound for the two-user
case, providing the exact memory-rate tradeoff. Numerical results show that, for general settings,
the gap between the optimized MCCS and the lower bound only exists in limited cases and is very small.

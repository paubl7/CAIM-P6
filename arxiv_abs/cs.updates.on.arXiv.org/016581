We address the problem of approximating the moments of the solution, $\boldsymbol{X}(t)$, of an
It\^o stochastic differential equation (SDE) with drift and a diffusion terms over a time-grid
$t_0, t_1, \ldots, t_n$. In particular, we assume an explicit numerical scheme for the generation
of sample paths $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}(t_0), \ldots, \hat{\boldsymbol{X}}(t_n), \ldots$ and
then obtain recursive equations that yield any desired non-central moment of $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}(t_n)$
as a function of the initial condition $\boldsymbol{X}_0$. The core of the methodology is the decomposition
of the numerical solution into a "central part" and an "effective noise" term. The central term is
computed deterministically from the ordinary differential equation (ODE) that results from eliminating
the diffusion term in the SDE, while the effective noise accounts for the stochastic deviation from
the numerical solution of the ODE. For simplicity, we describe algorithms based on an Euler-Maruyama
integrator, but other explicit numerical schemes can be exploited in the same way. We also apply
the moment approximations to construct estimates of the 1-dimensional marginal probability density
functions of $\hat{\boldsymbol{X}}(t_n)$ based on a Gram-Charlier expansion. Both for the approximation
of moments and 1-dimensional densities, we describe how to handle the cases in which the initial
condition is fixed (i.e., $\boldsymbol{X}_0 = \boldsymbol{x}_0$ for some known $\boldsymbol{x_0}$)
or random. In the latter case, we resort to polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) schemes to approximate
the target moments. The methodology has been inspired by the PCE and differential algebra (DA) methods
used for uncertainty propagation in astrodynamics problems. Hence, we illustrate its application
for the quantification of uncertainty in a 2-dimensional Keplerian orbit perturbed by a Wiener
noise process.

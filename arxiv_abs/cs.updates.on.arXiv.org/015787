Effective conservation actions require effective population monitoring. However, accurately
counting animals in the wild to inform conservation decision-making is difficult. Monitoring
populations through image sampling has made data collection cheaper, wide-reaching and less intrusive
but created a need to process and analyse this data efficiently. Counting animals from such data
is challenging, particularly when densely packed in noisy images. Attempting this manually is
slow and expensive, while traditional computer vision methods are limited in their generalisability.
Deep learning is the state-of-the-art method for many computer vision tasks, but it has yet to be
properly explored to count animals. To this end, we employ deep learning, with a density-based regression
approach, to count fish in low-resolution sonar images. We introduce a large dataset of sonar videos,
deployed to record wild mullet schools (Mugil liza), with a subset of 500 labelled images. We utilise
abundant unlabelled data in a self-supervised task to improve the supervised counting task. For
the first time in this context, by introducing uncertainty quantification, we improve model training
and provide an accompanying measure of prediction uncertainty for more informed biological decision-making.
Finally, we demonstrate the generalisability of our proposed counting framework through testing
it on a recent benchmark dataset of high-resolution annotated underwater images from varying habitats
(DeepFish). From experiments on both contrasting datasets, we demonstrate our network outperforms
the few other deep learning models implemented for solving this task. By providing an open-source
framework along with training data, our study puts forth an efficient deep learning template for
crowd counting aquatic animals thereby contributing effective methods to assess natural populations
from the ever-increasing visual data.

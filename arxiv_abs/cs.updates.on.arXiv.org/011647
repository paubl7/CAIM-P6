Context: The video game industry is a billion dollar industry that faces problems in the way games
are developed. One method to address these problems is using developer aid tools, such as Recommendation
Systems. These tools assist developers by generating recommendations to help them perform their
tasks. Objective: This article describes a systematic approach to recommend development processes
for video game projects, using postmortem knowledge extraction and a model of the context of the
new project, in which "postmortems" are articles written by video game developers at the end of projects,
summarizing the experience of their game development team. This approach aims to provide reflections
about development processes used in the game industry as well as guidance to developers to choose
the most adequate process according to the contexts they're in. Method: Our approach is divided
in three separate phases: in the the first phase, we manually extracted the processes from the postmortems
analysis; in the second one, we created a video game context and algorithm rules for recommendation;
and finally in the third phase, we evaluated the recommended processes by using quantitative and
qualitative metrics, game developers feedback, and a case study by interviewing a video game development
team. Contributions: This article brings three main contributions. The first describes a database
of developers' experiences extracted from postmortems in the form of development processes. The
second defines the main attributes that a video game project contain, which it uses to define the
contexts of the project. The third describes and evaluates a recommendation system for video game
projects, which uses the contexts of the projects to identify similar projects and suggest a set
of activities in the form of a process.

Tuberculosis (TB) remains a global health problem, and is the leading cause of death from an infectious
disease. A crucial step in the treatment of tuberculosis is screening high risk populations and
the early detection of the disease, with chest x-ray (CXR) imaging being the most widely-used imaging
modality. As such, there has been significant recent interest in artificial intelligence-based
TB screening solutions for use in resource-limited scenarios where there is a lack of trained healthcare
workers with expertise in CXR interpretation. Motivated by this pressing need and the recent recommendation
by the World Health Organization (WHO) for the use of computer-aided diagnosis of TB, we introduce
TB-Net, a self-attention deep convolutional neural network tailored for TB case screening. More
specifically, we leveraged machine-driven design exploration to build a highly customized deep
neural network architecture with attention condensers. We conducted an explainability-driven
performance validation process to validate TB-Net's decision-making behaviour. Experiments
using a tuberculosis CXR benchmark dataset showed that the proposed TB-Net is able to achieve accuracy/sensitivity/specificity
of 99.86%/100.0%/99.71%. Radiologist validation was conducted on select cases by two board-certified
radiologists with over 10 and 19 years of experience, respectively, and showed consistency between
radiologist interpretation and critical factors leveraged by TB-Net for TB case detection for
the case where radiologists identified anomalies. While not a production-ready solution, we hope
that the open-source release of TB-Net as part of the COVID-Net initiative will support researchers,
clinicians, and citizen data scientists in advancing this field in the fight against this global
public health crisis.

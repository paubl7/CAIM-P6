In this work, we study group recommendation in a particular scenario, namely Occasional Group Recommendation
(OGR). Most existing works have addressed OGR by aggregating group members' personal preferences
to learn the group representation. However, the representation learning for a group is most complex
beyond the fusion of group member representation, as the personal preferences and group preferences
may be in different spaces. In addition, the learned user representation is not accurate due to the
sparsity of users' interaction data. Moreover, the group similarity in terms of common group members
has been overlooked, which however has the great potential to improve the group representation
learning. In this work, we focus on addressing the above challenges in group representation learning
task, and devise a hierarchical hyperedge embedding-based group recommender, namely HyperGroup.
Specifically, we propose to leverage the user-user interactions to alleviate the sparsity issue
of user-item interactions, and design a GNN-based representation learning network to enhance
the learning of individuals' preferences from their friends' preferences, which provides a solid
foundation for learning groups' preferences. To exploit the group similarity to learn a more accurate
group representation from highly limited group-item interactions, we connect all groups as a network
of overlapping sets, and treat the task of group preference learning as embedding hyperedges in
a hypergraph, where an inductive hyperedge embedding method is proposed. To further enhance the
group-level preference modeling, we develop a joint training strategy to learn both user-item
and group-item interactions in the same process. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world
datasets and the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our proposed HyperGroup
in comparison to the state-of-the-art baselines.

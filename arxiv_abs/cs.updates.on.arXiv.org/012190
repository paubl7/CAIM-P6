Time series analysis is a key technique for extracting and predicting events in domains as diverse
as epidemiology, genomics, neuroscience, environmental sciences, economics, and more. Matrix
profile, the state-of-the-art algorithm to perform time series analysis, computes the most similar
subsequence for a given query subsequence within a sliced time series. Matrix profile has low arithmetic
intensity, but it typically operates on large amounts of time series data. In current computing
systems, this data needs to be moved between the off-chip memory units and the on-chip computation
units for performing matrix profile. This causes a major performance bottleneck as data movement
is extremely costly in terms of both execution time and energy. In this work, we present NATSA, the
first Near-Data Processing accelerator for time series analysis. The key idea is to exploit modern
3D-stacked High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) to enable efficient and fast specialized matrix profile
computation near memory, where time series data resides. NATSA provides three key benefits: 1)
quickly computing the matrix profile for a wide range of applications by building specialized energy-efficient
floating-point arithmetic processing units close to HBM, 2) improving the energy efficiency and
execution time by reducing the need for data movement over slow and energy-hungry buses between
the computation units and the memory units, and 3) analyzing time series data at scale by exploiting
low-latency, high-bandwidth, and energy-efficient memory access provided by HBM. Our experimental
evaluation shows that NATSA improves performance by up to 14.2x (9.9x on average) and reduces energy
by up to 27.2x (19.4x on average), over the state-of-the-art multi-core implementation. NATSA
also improves performance by 6.3x and reduces energy by 10.2x over a general-purpose NDP platform
with 64 in-order cores.

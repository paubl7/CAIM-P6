X-ray images may present non-trivial features with predictive information of patients that develop
severe symptoms of COVID-19. If true, this hypothesis may have practical value in allocating resources
to particular patients while using a relatively inexpensive imaging technique. The difficulty
of testing such a hypothesis comes from the need for large sets of labelled data, which need to be well-annotated
and should contemplate the post-imaging severity outcome. This paper presents an original methodology
for extracting semantic features that correlate to severity from a data set with patient ICU admission
labels through interpretable models. The methodology employs a neural network trained to recognise
lung pathologies to extract the semantic features, which are then analysed with low-complexity
models to limit overfitting while increasing interpretability. This analysis points out that
only a few features explain most of the variance between patients that developed severe symptoms.
When applied to an unrelated larger data set with pathology-related clinical notes, the method
has shown to be capable of selecting images for the learned features, which could translate some
information about their common locations in the lung. Besides attesting separability on patients
that eventually develop severe symptoms, the proposed methods represent a statistical approach
highlighting the importance of features related to ICU admission that may have been only qualitatively
reported. While handling limited data sets, notable methodological aspects are adopted, such
as presenting a state-of-the-art lung segmentation network and the use of low-complexity models
to avoid overfitting. The code for methodology and experiments is also available.

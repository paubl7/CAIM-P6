Radiomics is an active area of research in medical image analysis, the low reproducibility of radiomics
has limited its applicability to clinical practice. This issue is especially prominent when radiomic
features are calculated from noisy images, such as low dose computed tomography (CT) scans. In this
article, we investigate the possibility of improving the reproducibility of radiomic features
calculated on noisy CTs by using generative models for denoising.One traditional denoising method
- non-local means - and two generative models - encoder-decoder networks (EDN) and conditional
generative adversarial networks (CGANs) - were selected as the test models. We added noise to the
sinograms of full dose CTs to mimic low dose CTs with two different levels of noise: low-noise CT and
high-noise CT. Models were trained on high-noise CTs and used to denoise low-noise CTs without re-training.
We also test the performance of our model in real data, using dataset of same-day repeat low dose CTs
to assess the reproducibility of radiomic features in denoised images. The EDN and the CGAN improved
the concordance correlation coefficients (CCC) of radiomic features for low-noise images from
0.87 to 0.92 and for high-noise images from 0.68 to 0.92 respectively. Moreover, the EDN and the CGAN
improved the test-retest reliability of radiomic features (mean CCC increased from 0.89 to 0.94)
based on real low dose CTs. The results show that denoising using EDN and CGANs can improve the reproducibility
of radiomic features calculated on noisy CTs. Moreover, images with different noise levels can
be denoised to improve the reproducibility using these models without re-training, as long as the
noise intensity is equal or lower than that in high-noise CTs. To the authors' knowledge, this is
the first effort to improve the reproducibility of radiomic features calculated on low dose CT scans.

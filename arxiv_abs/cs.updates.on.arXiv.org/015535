Deformable image registration is a fundamental task in medical imaging. Due to the large computational
complexity of deformable registration of volumetric images, conventional iterative methods
usually face the tradeoff between the registration accuracy and the computation time in practice.
In order to boost the registration performance in both accuracy and runtime, we propose a fast convolutional
neural network. Specially, to efficiently utilize the memory resources and enlarge the model capacity,
we adopt additive forwarding instead of channel concatenation and deepen the network in each encoder
and decoder stage. To facilitate the learning efficiency, we leverage skip connection within the
encoder and decoder stages to enable residual learning and employ an auxiliary loss at the bottom
layer with lowest resolution to involve deep supervision. Particularly, the low-resolution auxiliary
loss is weighted by an exponentially decayed parameter during the training phase. In conjunction
with the main loss in high-resolution grid, a coarse-to-fine learning strategy is achieved. Last
but not least, we introduce an auxiliary loss based on the segmentation prior to improve the registration
performance in Dice score. Comparing to the auxiliary loss using average Dice score, the proposed
multi-label segmentation loss does not induce additional memory cost in the training phase and
can be employed on images with arbitrary amount of categories. In the experiments, we show FDRN outperforms
the existing state-of-the-art registration methods for brain MR images by resorting to the compact
network structure and efficient learning. Besides, FDRN is a generalized framework for image registration
which is not confined to a particular type of medical images or anatomy.

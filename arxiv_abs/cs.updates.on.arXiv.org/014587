Early detection of mild cognitive impairment and dementia is vital as many therapeutic interventions
are particularly effective at an early stage. A self-administered touch-based cognitive screening
instrument, called DemSelf, was developed by adapting an examiner-administered paper-based
instrument, the Quick Mild Cognitive Impairment (Qmci) screen. We conducted five semi-structured
expert interviews including a think-aloud phase to evaluate usability problems. The extent to
which the characteristics of the original subtests change by the adaption, as well as the conditions
and appropriate context for practical application, were also in question. The participants had
expertise in the domain of usability and human-machine interaction and/or in the domain of dementia
and neuropsychological assessment. Participants identified usability issues in all components
of the DemSelf prototype. For example, confirmation of answers was not consistent across subtests.
Answers were sometimes logged directly when a button is tapped and cannot be corrected. This can
lead to frustration and bias in test results, especially for people with vision or motor impairments.
The direct adoption of time limits from the original paper-based instrument or the simultaneous
verbal and textual item presentation also caused usability problems. DemSelf is a different test
than Qmci and needs to be re-validated. Visual recognition instead of a free verbal recall is one
of the main differences. Reading skill level seems to be an important confounding variable. Participants
would generally prefer if the test is conducted in a medical office rather than at a patient's home
so that someone is present for support and the result can be discussed directly.

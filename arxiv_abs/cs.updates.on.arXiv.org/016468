Sensing and measurement systems are quintessential to the safe and reliable operation of electric
power grids. Their strategic placement is of ultimate importance because it is not economically
viable to install measurement systems on every node and branch of a power grid, though they need to
be monitored. An overwhelming number of strategies have been developed to meet oftentimes multiple
conflicting objectives. The prime challenge in formulating the problem lies in developing a heuristic
or an optimization model that, though mathematically tractable and constrained in cost, leads
to trustworthy technical solutions. Further, large-scale, long-term deployments pose additional
challenges because the boundary conditions change as technologies evolve. For instance, the advent
of new technologies in sensing and measurement, as well as in communications and networking, might
impact the cost and performance of available solutions and shift initially set conditions. Also,
the placement strategies developed for transmission grids might not be suitable for distribution
grids, and vice versa, because of unique characteristics. Therefore, the strategies need to be
flexible, to a certain extent, because no two power grids are alike. Despite the extensive literature
on the present topic, the focus of published works tends to be on a specific subject, such as the optimal
placement of measurements to ensure observability in transmission grids. There is a dearth of work
providing a comprehensive picture for developing optimal placement strategies. Because of the
ongoing efforts on the modernization of electric power grids, there is a need to consolidate the
status quo while exposing its limitations to inform policymakers, industry stakeholders, and
researchers on the research-and-development needs to push the boundaries for innovation.

Most visual analytics systems assume that all foraging for data happens before the analytics process;
once analysis begins, the set of data attributes considered is fixed. Such separation of data construction
from analysis precludes iteration that can enable foraging informed by the needs that arise in-situ
during the analysis. The separation of the foraging loop from the data analysis tasks can limit the
pace and scope of analysis. In this paper, we present CAVA, a system that integrates data curation
and data augmentation with the traditional data exploration and analysis tasks, enabling information
foraging in-situ during analysis. Identifying attributes to add to the dataset is difficult because
it requires human knowledge to determine which available attributes will be helpful for the ensuing
analytical tasks. CAVA crawls knowledge graphs to provide users with a a broad set of attributes
drawn from external data to choose from. Users can then specify complex operations on knowledge
graphs to construct additional attributes. CAVA shows how visual analytics can help users forage
for attributes by letting users visually explore the set of available data, and by serving as an interface
for query construction. It also provides visualizations of the knowledge graph itself to help users
understand complex joins such as multi-hop aggregations. We assess the ability of our system to
enable users to perform complex data combinations without programming in a user study over two datasets.
We then demonstrate the generalizability of CAVA through two additional usage scenarios. The results
of the evaluation confirm that CAVA is effective in helping the user perform data foraging that leads
to improved analysis outcomes, and offer evidence in support of integrating data augmentation
as a part of the visual analytics pipeline.

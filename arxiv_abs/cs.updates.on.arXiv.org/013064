Video game genre classification based on its cover and textual description would be utterly beneficial
to many modern identification, collocation, and retrieval systems. At the same time, it is also
an extremely challenging task due to the following reasons: First, there exists a wide variety of
video game genres, many of which are not concretely defined. Second, video game covers vary in many
different ways such as colors, styles, textual information, etc, even for games of the same genre.
Third, cover designs and textual descriptions may vary due to many external factors such as country,
culture, target reader populations, etc. With the growing competitiveness in the video game industry,
the cover designers and typographers push the cover designs to its limit in the hope of attracting
sales. The computer-based automatic video game genre classification systems become a particularly
exciting research topic in recent years. In this paper, we propose a multi-modal deep learning framework
to solve this problem. The contribution of this paper is four-fold. First, we compiles a large dataset
consisting of 50,000 video games from 21 genres made of cover images, description text, and title
text and the genre information. Second, image-based and text-based, state-of-the-art models
are evaluated thoroughly for the task of genre classification for video games. Third, we developed
an efficient and salable multi-modal framework based on both images and texts. Fourth, a thorough
analysis of the experimental results is given and future works to improve the performance is suggested.
The results show that the multi-modal framework outperforms the current state-of-the-art image-based
or text-based models. Several challenges are outlined for this task. More efforts and resources
are needed for this classification task in order to reach a satisfactory level.

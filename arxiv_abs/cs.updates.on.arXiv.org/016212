New interactive physical-digital play technologies are shaping the way children plan. These technologies
refer to digital play technologies that engage children in analogue forms of behaviour, either
alone or with others. Current interactive physical-digital play technologies include robots,
digital agents, mixed or augmented reality devices, and smart-eye based gaming. Little is known,
however, about the ways in which these technologies could promote or damage child development.
This systematic review was aimed at understanding if and how these physical-digital play technologies
promoted developmentally relevant behaviour in typically developing 0 to 12 year-olds. Psychology,
Education, and Computer Science databases were searched producing 635 paper. A total of 31 papers
met the inclusion criteria, of which 17 were of high enough quality to be included for synthesis.
Results indicate that these new interactive play technologies could have a positive effect on children's
developmentally relevant behaviour. The review indicated specific ways in which different behaviour
were promoted. Providing information about own performance promoted self-monitoring. Slowing
interactivity, play interdependency, and joint object accessibility promoted collaboration.
Offering delimited choices promoted decision making. Problem solving and physical activity were
promoted by requiring children to engage in them to keep playing. Four principles underpinned the
ways in which physical digital play technologies afforded child behaviour. These included social
expectations framing play situations, the directiveness of action regulations (inviting, guiding
or forcing behaviours), the technical features of play technologies (digital play mechanics and
physical characteristics), and the alignment between play goals, play technology and the play
behaviours promoted.

Serverless computing has rapidly grown following the launch of Amazon's Lambda platform. Function-as-a-Service
(FaaS) a key enabler of serverless computing allows an application to be decomposed into simple,
standalone functions that are executed on a FaaS platform. The FaaS platform is responsible for
deploying and facilitating resources to the functions. Several of today's cloud applications
spread over heterogeneous connected computing resources and are highly dynamic in their structure
and resource requirements. However, FaaS platforms are limited to homogeneous clusters and homogeneous
functions and do not account for the data access behavior of functions before scheduling. We introduce
an extension of FaaS to heterogeneous clusters and to support heterogeneous functions through
a network of distributed heterogeneous target platforms called Function Delivery Network (FDN).
A target platform is a combination of a cluster of homogeneous nodes and a FaaS platform on top of it.
FDN provides Function-Delivery-as-a-Service (FDaaS), delivering the function to the right target
platform. We showcase the opportunities such as varied target platform's characteristics, possibility
of collaborative execution between multiple target platforms, and localization of data that the
FDN offers in fulfilling two objectives: Service Level Objective (SLO) requirements and energy
efficiency when scheduling functions by evaluating over five distributed target platforms using
the FDNInspector, a tool developed by us for benchmarking distributed target platforms. Scheduling
functions on an edge target platform in our evaluation reduced the overall energy consumption by
17x without violating the SLO requirements in comparison to scheduling on a high-end target platform.

In recent years, several online platforms have seen a rapid increase in the number of review systems
that request users to provide aspect-level feedback. Multi-Aspect Rating Prediction (MARP),
where the goal is to predict the ratings from a review at an individual aspect level, has become a challenging
and an imminent problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose a deliberate self-attention deep
neural network model, named as FEDAR, for the MARP problem, which can achieve competitive performance
while also being able to interpret the predictions made. As opposed to the previous studies, which
make use of hand-crafted keywords to determine aspects in sentiment predictions, our model does
not suffer from human bias issues since aspect keywords are automatically detected through a self-attention
mechanism. FEDAR is equipped with a highway word embedding layer to transfer knowledge from pre-trained
word embeddings, an RNN encoder layer with output features enriched by pooling and factorization
techniques, and a deliberate self-attention layer. In addition, we also propose an Attention-driven
Keywords Ranking (AKR) method, which can automatically extract aspect-level sentiment-related
keywords from the review corpus based on the attention weights. Since crowdsourcing annotation
can be an alternate way to recover missing ratings of reviews, we propose a LEcture-AuDience (LEAD)
strategy to estimate model uncertainty in the context of multi-task learning, so that valuable
human resources can focus on the most uncertain predictions. Our extensive set of experiments on
different DMSC datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed FEDAR and LEAD models. Visualization
of aspect-level sentiment keywords demonstrate the interpretability of our model and effectiveness
of our AKR method.

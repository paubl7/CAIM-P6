Identifying bio-signals based-sleep stages requires time-consuming and tedious labor of skilled
clinicians. Deep learning approaches have been introduced in order to challenge the automatic
sleep stage classification conundrum. However, the difficulties can be posed in replacing the
clinicians with the automatic system due to the differences in many aspects found in individual
bio-signals, causing the inconsistency in the performance of the model on every incoming individual.
Thus, we aim to explore the feasibility of using a novel approach, capable of assisting the clinicians
and lessening the workload. We propose the transfer learning framework, entitled MetaSleepLearner,
based on Model Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML), in order to transfer the acquired sleep staging knowledge
from a large dataset to new individual subjects. The framework was demonstrated to require the labelling
of only a few sleep epochs by the clinicians and allow the remainder to be handled by the system. Layer-wise
Relevance Propagation (LRP) was also applied to understand the learning course of our approach.
In all acquired datasets, in comparison to the conventional approach, MetaSleepLearner achieved
a range of 5.4\% to 17.7\% improvement with statistical difference in the mean of both approaches.
The illustration of the model interpretation after the adaptation to each subject also confirmed
that the performance was directed towards reasonable learning. MetaSleepLearner outperformed
the conventional approaches as a result from the fine-tuning using the recordings of both healthy
subjects and patients. This is the first work that investigated a non-conventional pre-training
method, MAML, resulting in a possibility for human-machine collaboration in sleep stage classification
and easing the burden of the clinicians in labelling the sleep stages through only several epochs
rather than an entire recording.

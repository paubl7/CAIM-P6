Social media popularity and importance is on the increase, due to people using it for various types
of social interaction across multiple channels. This social interaction by online users includes
submission of feedback, opinions and recommendations about various individuals, entities, topics,
and events. This systematic review focuses on the evolving research area of Social Opinion Mining,
tasked with the identification of multiple opinion dimensions, such as subjectivity, sentiment
polarity, emotion, affect, sarcasm and irony, from user-generated content represented across
multiple social media platforms and in various media formats, like text, image, video and audio.
Therefore, through Social Opinion Mining, natural language can be understood in terms of the different
opinion dimensions, as expressed by humans. This contributes towards the evolution of Artificial
Intelligence, which in turn helps the advancement of several real-world use cases, such as customer
service and decision making. A thorough systematic review was carried out on Social Opinion Mining
research which totals 485 studies and spans a period of twelve years between 2007 and 2018. The in-depth
analysis focuses on the social media platforms, techniques, social datasets, language, modality,
tools and technologies, natural language processing tasks and other aspects derived from the published
studies. Such multi-source information fusion plays a fundamental role in mining of people's social
opinions from social media platforms. These can be utilised in many application areas, ranging
from marketing, advertising and sales for product/service management, and in multiple domains
and industries, such as politics, technology, finance, healthcare, sports and government. Future
research directions are presented, whereas further research and development has the potential
of leaving a wider academic and societal impact.

The performance of data-driven prediction models depends on the availability of data samples for
model training. A model that learns about dengue fever incidence in a population uses historical
data from that corresponding location. Poor performance in prediction can result in places with
inadequate data. This work aims to enhance temporally limited dengue case data by methodological
addition of epidemically relevant data from nearby locations as predictors (features). A novel
framework is presented for windowing incidence data and computing time-shifted correlation-based
metrics to quantify feature relevance. The framework ranks incidence data of adjacent locations
around a target location by combining the correlation metric with two other metrics: spatial distance
and local prevalence. Recurrent neural network-based prediction models achieve up to 33.6% accuracy
improvement on average using the proposed method compared to using training data from the target
location only. These models achieved mean absolute error (MAE) values as low as 0.128 on [0,1] normalized
incidence data for a municipality with the highest dengue prevalence in Brazil's Espirito Santo.
When predicting cases aggregated over geographical ecoregions, the models achieved accuracy
improvements up to 16.5%, using only 6.5% of incidence data from ranked feature sets. The paper also
includes two techniques for windowing time series data: fixed-sized windows and outbreak detection
windows. Both of these techniques perform comparably, while the window detection method uses less
data for computations. The framework presented in this paper is application-independent, and
it could improve the performances of prediction models where data from spatially adjacent locations
are available.

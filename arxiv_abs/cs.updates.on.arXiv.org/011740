The task of repeatedly solving parametrized partial differential equations (pPDEs) in, e.g. optimization
or interactive applications, makes it imperative to design highly efficient and equally accurate
surrogate models. The reduced basis method (RBM) presents as such an option. Enabled by a mathematically
rigorous error estimator, RBM constructs a low-dimensional subspace of the parameter-induced
high fidelity solution manifold from which an approximate solution is computed. It can improve
efficiency by several orders of magnitudes leveraging an offline-online decomposition procedure.
However, this decomposition, usually through the empirical interpolation method (EIM) when the
PDE is nonlinear or its parameter dependence nonaffine, is either challenging to implement, or
severely degrades online efficiency. In this paper, we augment and extend the EIM approach as a direct
solver, as opposed to an assistant, for solving nonlinear pPDEs on the reduced level. The resulting
method, called Reduced Over-Collocation method (ROC), is stable and capable of avoiding the efficiency
degradation inherent to a traditional application of EIM. Two critical ingredients of the scheme
are collocation at about twice as many locations as the dimension of the reduced solution space,
and an efficient L1-norm-based error indicator for the strategic selection of the parameter values
to build the reduced solution space. Together, these two ingredients render the proposed L1-ROC
scheme both offline- and online-efficient. A distinctive feature is that the efficiency degradation
appearing in alternative RBM approaches that utilize EIM for nonlinear and nonaffine problems
is circumvented, both in the offline and online stages. Numerical tests on different families of
time-dependent and steady-state nonlinear problems demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy
of L1-ROC and its superior stability performance.

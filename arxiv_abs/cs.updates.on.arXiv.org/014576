In this paper, we consider contention resolution on a multiple-access communication channel.
In this problem, a set of nodes arrive over time, each with a message it intends to send. In each time
slot, each node may attempt to broadcast its message or remain idle. If a single node broadcasts in
a slot, the message is received by all nodes; otherwise, if multiple nodes broadcast simultaneously,
a collision occurs and none succeeds. If collision detection is available, nodes can differentiate
collision and silence (i.e., no nodes broadcast). Performance of contention resolution algorithms
is often measured by throughput -- the number of successful transmissions within a period of time;
whereas robustness is often measured by jamming resistance -- a jammed slot always generates a collision.
Previous work has shown, with collision detection, optimal constant throughput can be attained,
even if a constant fraction of all slots are jammed. The situation when collision detection is not
available, however, remains unclear. In a recent breakthrough paper [Bender et al., STOC '20],
a crucial case is resolved: constant throughput is possible without collision detection, but only
if there is no jamming. Nonetheless, the exact trade-off between the best possible throughput and
the severity of jamming remains unknown. In this paper, we address this open question. Specifically,
for any level of jamming ranging from none to constant fraction, we prove an upper bound on the best
possible throughput, along with an algorithm attaining that bound. An immediate and interesting
implication of our result is, when a constant fraction of all slots are jammed, which is the worst-case
scenario, there still exists an algorithm achieving a decent throughput: $\Theta(t/\log{t})$
messages could be successfully transmitted within $t$ slots.

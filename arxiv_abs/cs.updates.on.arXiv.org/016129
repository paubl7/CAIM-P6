A novel numerical formulation for solving fluid-structure interaction (FSI) problems is proposed
where the fluid field is spatially discretized using smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) and
the structural field using the finite element method (FEM). As compared to fully mesh- or grid-based
FSI frameworks, due to the Lagrangian nature of SPH this framework can be easily extended to account
for more complex fluids consisting of multiple phases and dynamic phase transitions. Moreover,
this approach facilitates the handling of large deformations of the fluid domain respectively
the fluid-structure interface without additional methodological and computational efforts.
In particular, to achieve an accurate representation of interaction forces between fluid particles
and structural elements also for strongly curved interface geometries, the novel sliding boundary
particle approach is proposed to ensure full support of SPH particles close to the interface. The
coupling of the fluid and the structural field is based on a Dirichlet-Neumann partitioned approach,
where the fluid field is the Dirichlet partition with prescribed interface displacements and the
structural field is the Neumann partition subject to interface forces. To overcome instabilities
inherent to weakly coupled schemes an iterative fixed-point coupling scheme is employed. Several
numerical examples in form of well-known benchmark tests are considered to validate the accuracy,
stability, and robustness of the proposed formulation. Finally, the filling process of a highly
flexible thin-walled balloon-like container is studied, representing a model problem close to
potential application scenarios of the proposed scheme in the field of biomechanics.

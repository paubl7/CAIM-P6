Computationally solving the equations of elasticity is a key component in many materials science
and mechanics simulations. Phenomena such as deformation-induced microstructure evolution,
microfracture, and microvoid nucleation are examples of applications for which accurate stress
and strain fields are required. A characteristic feature of these simulations is that the problem
domain is simple (typically a rectilinear representative volume element (RVE)), but the evolution
of internal topological features is extremely complex. Traditionally, the finite element method
(FEM) is used for elasticity calculations; FEM is nearly ubiquituous due to (1) its ability to handle
meshes of complex geometry using isoparametric elements, and (2) the weak formulation which eschews
the need for computation of second derivatives. However, variable topology problems (e.g. microstructure
evolution) require either remeshing, or adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) - both of which can cause
extensive overhead and limited scaling. Block-structured AMR (BSAMR) is a method for adaptive
mesh refinement that exhibits good scaling and is well-suited for many problems in materials science.
Here, it is shown that the equations of elasticity can be efficiently solved using BSAMR using the
finite difference method. The boundary operator method is used to treat different types of boundary
conditions, and the "reflux-free" method is introduced to efficiently and easily treat the coarse-fine
boundaries that arise in BSAMR. Examples are presented that demonstrate the use of this method in
a variety of cases relevant to materials science: Eshelby inclusions, fracture, and microstructure
evolution. Reasonable scaling is demonstrated up to $\sim$4000 processors with tens of millions
of grid points, and good AMR efficiency is observed.

For a long time the ability to solve abstract reasoning tasks was considered one of the hallmarks
of human intelligence. Recent advances in application of deep learning (DL) methods led, as in many
other domains, to surpassing human abstract reasoning performance, specifically in the most popular
type of such problems - the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPMs). While the efficacy of DL systems
is indeed impressive, the way they approach the RPMs is very different from that of humans. State-of-the-art
systems solving RPMs rely on massive pattern-based training and sometimes on exploiting biases
in the dataset, whereas humans concentrate on identification of the rules / concepts underlying
the RPM (or generally a visual reasoning task) to be solved. Motivated by this cognitive difference,
this work aims at combining DL with human way of solving RPMs and getting the best of both worlds. Specifically,
we cast the problem of solving RPMs into multi-label classification framework where each RPM is
viewed as a multi-label data point, with labels determined by the set of abstract rules underlying
the RPM. For efficient training of the system we introduce a generalisation of the Noise Contrastive
Estimation algorithm to the case of multi-label samples. Furthermore, we propose a new sparse rule
encoding scheme for RPMs which, besides the new training algorithm, is the key factor contributing
to the state-of-the-art performance. The proposed approach is evaluated on two most popular benchmark
datasets (Balanced-RAVEN and PGM) and on both of them demonstrates an advantage over the current
state-of-the-art results. Contrary to applications of contrastive learning methods reported
in other domains, the state-of-the-art performance reported in the paper is achieved with no need
for large batch sizes or strong data augmentation.

Even though the traffic systems in developed countries have been analyzed with rigor and operated
efficiently, the same does not generally hold for developing countries due to inadequate planning,
design, and operations of their transportation systems. Because of inherent differences between
internal infrastructures, the systems deployed in developed countries may not be amenable to developing
ones. Besides, the traffic systems of developing countries are not well-studied in the literature
to the best of our knowledge. For example, it is yet to explore how a developed country's lane-based
traffic flow would perform in the context of a developing country, which generally experiences
non-lane-based traffic. As such, by using our newly developed traffic simulator 'RoadBird', we
investigate outcomes of both lane-based and non-lane-based traffic from the contexts of both developing
and developed countries. To do so, we run simulations over real road topologies (extracted from
the GIS maps of major cities such as Dhaka, Miami, and Riyadh) considering different scenarios such
as lane-based or non-lane-based flows, homogeneous or heterogeneous traffic, with or without
pedestrians, etc. We also incorporate different car-following and lane-changing models to mimic
traffic behaviors and investigate their performances. While the lane changing dilemma remains
an open research question, our experimental evidences indicate: (i) lane-based approaches will
not necessarily perform better in the case of currently-adopted non-lane-based scenarios; and
(ii) non-lane-based strategies may benefit system performance in lane-based scenarios while
having heavy mixed traffic. Nonetheless, we reveal several new insights for on-road experiences
both in developing and developed countries.

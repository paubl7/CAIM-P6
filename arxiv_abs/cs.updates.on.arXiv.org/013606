Expert networks are formed by a group of expert-professionals with different specialties to collaboratively
resolve specific queries posted to the network. In such networks, when a query reaches an expert
who does not have sufficient expertise, this query needs to be routed to other experts for further
processing until it is completely solved; therefore, query answering efficiency is sensitive
to the underlying query routing mechanism being used. Among all possible query routing mechanisms,
decentralized search, operating purely on each expert's local information without any knowledge
of network global structure, represents the most basic and scalable routing mechanism, which is
applicable to any network scenarios even in dynamic networks. However, there is still a lack of fundamental
understanding of the efficiency of decentralized search in expert networks. In this regard, we
investigate decentralized search by quantifying its performance under a variety of network settings.
Our key findings reveal the existence of network conditions, under which decentralized search
can achieve significantly short query routing paths (i.e., between $O(\log n)$ and $O(\log^2 n)$
hops, $n$: total number of experts in the network). Based on such theoretical foundation, we further
study how the unique properties of decentralized search in expert networks is related to the anecdotal
small-world phenomenon. In addition, we demonstrate that decentralized search is robust against
estimation errors introduced by misinterpreting the required expertise levels. To the best of
our knowledge, this is the first work studying fundamental behaviors of decentralized search in
expert networks. The developed performance bounds, confirmed by real datasets, are able to assist
in predicting network performance and designing complex expert networks.

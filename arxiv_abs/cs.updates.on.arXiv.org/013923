Identifying anomalies in multi-dimensional datasets is an important task in many real-world applications.
A special case arises when anomalies are occluded in a small set of attributes, typically referred
to as a subspace, and not necessarily over the entire data space. In this paper, we propose a new subspace
analysis approach named Agglomerative Attribute Grouping (AAG) that aims to address this challenge
by searching for subspaces that are comprised of highly correlative attributes. Such correlations
among attributes represent a systematic interaction among the attributes that can better reflect
the behavior of normal observations and hence can be used to improve the identification of two particularly
interesting types of abnormal data samples: anomalies that are occluded in relatively small subsets
of the attributes and anomalies that represent a new data class. AAG relies on a novel multi-attribute
measure, which is derived from information theory measures of partitions, for evaluating the "information
distance" between groups of data attributes. To determine the set of subspaces to use, AAG applies
a variation of the well-known agglomerative clustering algorithm with the proposed multi-attribute
measure as the underlying distance function. Finally, the set of subspaces is used in an ensemble
for anomaly detection. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that, in the vast majority of cases,
the proposed AAG method (i) outperforms classical and state-of-the-art subspace analysis methods
when used in anomaly detection ensembles, and (ii) generates fewer subspaces with a fewer number
of attributes each (on average), thus resulting in a faster training time for the anomaly detection
ensemble. Furthermore, in contrast to existing methods, the proposed AAG method does not require
any tuning of parameters.

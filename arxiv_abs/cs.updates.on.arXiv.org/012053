Autonomous vehicles need to estimate the relative poses, i.e., position and orientation, of the
surrounding vehicles on the road with at least 50 Hz rate and cm-level accuracy for platooning and
collision avoidance applications. The LIDAR/camera solutions currently used for vehicle pose
estimation do not satisfy these rate and accuracy requirements, necessitating complementary
technologies. Vehicular visible light positioning (VLP) is a highly suitable complementary technology
due to its high rate and high accuracy, exploiting the line-of-sight propagation feature of the
visible light communication (VLC) signals from LED head/tail lights. However, existing vehicular
VLP solutions impose restrictive requirements, e.g., high-bandwidth circuit, base station and
VLC waveform constraints, and work for limited relative vehicle orientations, thus, cannot be
extended for pose estimation. This paper proposes a VLP-based vehicle pose estimation (VLP-VPE)
solution that eliminates these restrictive requirements by a novel VLC receiver design and a novel
pose estimation algorithm. The VLC receiver, named QRX, is low-cost/size, and enables high-rate
VLC and high-accuracy angle-of-arrival sensing, simultaneously, via the usage of a quadrant photodiode.
The estimation algorithm first uses two of the designed QRXs to determine the positions of two head/tail
light VLC transmitters on a neighbouring vehicle via triangulation, and then determines the 2D
pose of the vehicle based on these two positions. Sensitivity analyses and simulations using traffic
data from the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) demonstrate that the proposed solution performs
pose estimation at cm-level accuracy and kHz rate under realistic road and channel conditions,
demonstrating its eligibility for platooning and collision avoidance applications.

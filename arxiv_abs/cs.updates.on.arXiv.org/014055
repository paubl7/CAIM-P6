Future integrated terrestrial, aerial, and space networks will involve thousands of Low Earth
Orbit (LEO) satellites forming a network of mega-constellations, which will play a significant
role in providing communication and Internet services everywhere, at any time, and for everything.
Due to its very large scale and highly dynamic nature, future LEO satellite networks (SatNets) management
is a very complicated and crucial process, especially the mobility management aspect and its two
components location management and handover management. In this article, we present a comprehensive
and critical review of the state-of-the-art research in LEO SatNets location management. First,
we give an overview of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) mobility management standards
(e.g., Mobile IPv6 and Proxy Mobile IPv6) and discuss their location management techniques limitations
in the environment of future LEO SatNets. We highlight future LEO SatNets mobility characteristics
and their challenging features and describe two unprecedented future location management scenarios.
A taxonomy of the available location management solutions for LEO SatNets is presented, where the
solutions are classified into three approaches. For each of the reviewed approaches, the "Issues
to consider" section draws attention to important points that should be considered in future LEO
SatNets location management. To identify the gaps, the current state of LEO SatNets location management
is summarized and the challenges facing future LEO SatNets location management are discussed.
Worthy research directions are recommended. This article is providing a road map for researchers
and industry to shape the future of LEO SatNets location management.

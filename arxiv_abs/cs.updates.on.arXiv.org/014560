Autonomous CPSs are often required to handle uncertainties and self-manage the system operation
in response to problems and increasing risk in the operating paradigm. This risk may arise due to
distribution shifts, environmental context, or failure of software or hardware components. Traditional
techniques for risk assessment focus on design-time techniques such as hazard analysis, risk reduction,
and assurance cases among others. However, these static, design-time techniques do not consider
the dynamic contexts and failures the systems face at runtime. We hypothesize that this requires
a dynamic assurance approach that computes the likelihood of unsafe conditions or system failures
considering the safety requirements, assumptions made at design time, past failures in a given
operating context, and the likelihood of system component failures. We introduce the ReSonAte
dynamic risk estimation framework for autonomous systems. ReSonAte reasons over Bow-Tie Diagrams
(BTDs) which capture information about hazard propagation paths and control strategies. Our innovation
is the extension of the BTD formalism with attributes for modeling the conditional relationships
with the state of the system and environment. We also describe a technique for estimating these conditional
relationships and equations for estimating risk based on the state of the system and environment.
To help with this process, we provide a scenario modeling procedure that can use the prior distributions
of the scenes and threat conditions to generate the data required for estimating the conditional
relationships. To improve scalability and reduce the amount of data required, this process considers
each control strategy in isolation and composes several single-variate distributions into one
complete multi-variate distribution for the control strategy in question.

This paper integrates non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and over-the-air federated learning
(AirFL) into a unified framework using one simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable
intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). The STAR-RIS plays an important role in adjusting the decoding
order of hybrid users for efficient interference mitigation and omni-directional coverage extension.
To capture the impact of non-ideal wireless channels on AirFL, a closed-form expression for the
optimality gap (a.k.a. convergence upper bound) between the actual loss and the optimal loss is
derived. This analysis reveals that the learning performance is significantly affected by active
and passive beamforming schemes as well as wireless noise. Furthermore, when the learning rate
diminishes as the training proceeds, the optimality gap is explicitly characterized to converge
with a linear rate. To accelerate convergence while satisfying QoS requirements, a mixed-integer
non-linear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated by jointly designing the transmit power
at users and the configuration mode of STAR-RIS. Next, a trust region-based successive convex approximation
method and a penalty-based semidefinite relaxation approach are proposed to handle the decoupled
non-convex subproblems iteratively. An alternating optimization algorithm is then developed
to find a suboptimal solution for the original MINLP problem. Extensive simulation results show
that i) the proposed framework can efficiently support NOMA and AirFL users via concurrent uplink
communications, ii) our algorithms can achieve a faster convergence rate on IID and non-IID settings
compared to existing baselines, and iii) both the spectrum efficiency and learning performance
can be significantly improved with the aid of the well-tuned STAR-RIS.

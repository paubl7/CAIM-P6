Robotic applications nowadays are widely adopted to enhance operational automation and performance
of real-world Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) including Industry 4.0, agriculture, healthcare,
and disaster management. These applications are composed of latency-sensitive, data-heavy,
and compute-intensive tasks. The robots, however, are constrained in the computational power
and storage capacity. The concept of multi-agent cloud robotics enables robot-to-robot cooperation
and creates a complementary environment for the robots in executing large-scale applications
with the capability to utilize the edge and cloud resources. However, in such a collaborative environment,
the optimal resource allocation for robotic tasks is challenging to achieve. Heterogeneous energy
consumption rates and application of execution costs associated with the robots and computing
instances make it even more complex. In addition, the data transmission delay between local robots,
edge nodes, and cloud data centres adversely affects the real-time interactions and impedes service
performance guarantee. Taking all these issues into account, this paper comprehensively surveys
the state-of-the-art on resource allocation and service provisioning in multi-agent cloud robotics.
The paper presents the application domains of multi-agent cloud robotics through explicit comparison
with the contemporary computing paradigms and identifies the specific research challenges. A
complete taxonomy on resource allocation is presented for the first time, together with the discussion
of resource pooling, computation offloading, and task scheduling for efficient service provisioning.
Furthermore, we highlight the research gaps from the learned lessons, and present future directions
deemed beneficial to further advance this emerging field.

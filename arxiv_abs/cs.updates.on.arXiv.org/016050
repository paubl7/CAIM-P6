The vision of the internet of things (IoT) is a reality now. IoT devices are getting cheaper, smaller.
They are becoming more and more computationally and energy-efficient. The global market of IoT-based
video analytics has seen significant growth in recent years and it is expected to be a growing market
segment. For any IoT-based video analytics application, few key points required, such as cost-effectiveness,
widespread use, flexible design, accurate scene detection, reusability of the framework. Video-based
smart doorbell system is one such application domain for video analytics where many commercial
offerings are available in the consumer market. However, such existing offerings are costly, monolithic,
and proprietary. Also, there will be a trade-off between accuracy and portability. To address the
foreseen problems, I'm proposing a distributed framework for video analytics with a use case of
a smart doorbell system. The proposed framework uses AWS cloud services as a base platform and to
meet the price affordability constraint, the system was implemented on affordable Raspberry Pi.
The smart doorbell will be able to recognize the known/unknown person with at most accuracy. The
smart doorbell system is also having additional detection functionalities such as harmful weapon
detection, noteworthy vehicle detection, animal/pet detection. An iOS application is specifically
developed for this implementation which can receive the notification from the smart doorbell in
real-time. Finally, the paper also mentions the classical approaches for video analytics, their
feasibility in implementing with this use-case, and comparative analysis in terms of accuracy
and time required to detect an object in the frame is carried out. Results conclude that AWS cloud-based
approach is worthy for this smart doorbell use case.

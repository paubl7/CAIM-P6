Climate change is a burning issue of our time, with the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 13 of the
United Nations demanding global climate action. Realizing the urgency, in 2015 in Paris, world
leaders signed an agreement committing to taking voluntary action to reduce carbon emissions.
However, the scale, magnitude, and climate action processes vary globally, especially between
developed and developing countries. Therefore, from parliament to social media, the debates and
discussions on climate change gather data from wide-ranging sources essential to the policy design
and implementation. The downside is that we do not currently have the mechanisms to pool the worldwide
dispersed knowledge emerging from the structured and unstructured data sources. The paper thematically
discusses how NLP techniques could be employed in climate policy research and contribute to society's
good at large. In particular, we exemplify symbiosis of NLP and Climate Policy Research via four
methodologies. The first one deals with the major topics related to climate policy using automated
content analysis. We investigate the opinions (sentiments) of major actors' narratives towards
climate policy in the second methodology. The third technique explores the climate actors' beliefs
towards pro or anti-climate orientation. Finally, we discuss developing a Climate Knowledge Graph.
The present theme paper further argues that creating a knowledge platform would help in the formulation
of a holistic climate policy and effective climate action. Such a knowledge platform would integrate
the policy actors' varied opinions from different social sectors like government, business, civil
society, and the scientific community. The research outcome will add value to effective climate
action because policymakers can make informed decisions by looking at the diverse public opinion
on a comprehensive platform.

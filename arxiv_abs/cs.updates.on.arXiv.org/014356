*The following abbreviates the abstract. Please refer to the thesis for the full abstract.* After
a disaster, locating and extracting victims quickly is critical because mortality rises rapidly
after the first two days. To assist search and rescue teams and improve response times, teams of camera-equipped
aerial robots can engage in tasks such as mapping buildings and locating victims. These sensing
tasks encapsulate difficult (NP-Hard) problems. One way to simplify planning for these tasks is
to focus on maximizing sensing performance over a short time horizon. Specifically, consider the
problem of how to select motions for a team of robots to maximize a notion of sensing quality (the sensing
objective) over the near future, say by maximizing the amount of unknown space in a map that robots
will observe over the next several seconds. By repeating this process regularly, the team can react
quickly to new observations as they work to complete the sensing task. In technical terms, this planning
and control process forms an example of receding-horizon control. Fortunately, common sensing
objectives benefit from well-known monotonicity properties (e.g. submodularity), and greedy
algorithms can exploit these monotonicity properties to solve the receding-horizon optimization
problems that we study near-optimally. However, greedy algorithms typically force robots to make
decisions sequentially so that planning time grows with the number of robots. Further, recent works
that investigate sequential greedy planning, have demonstrated that reducing the number of sequential
steps while retaining suboptimality guarantees can be hard or impossible. We demonstrate that
halting growth in planning time is sometimes possible. To do so, we introduce novel greedy algorithms
involving fixed numbers of sequential steps.

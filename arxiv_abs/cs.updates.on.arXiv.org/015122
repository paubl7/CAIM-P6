Mathematical optimization is one of the cornerstones of modern engineering research and practice.
Yet, throughout application domains, mathematical optimization is, for the most part, considered
to be a numerical discipline. Optimization problems are formulated to be solved numerically with
specific algorithms running on microprocessors. An emerging alternative is to view optimization
algorithms as dynamical systems. While this new perspective is insightful in itself, liberating
optimization methods from specific numerical and algorithmic aspects opens up new possibilities
to endow complex real-world systems with sophisticated self-optimizing behavior. Towards this
goal, it is necessary to understand how numerical optimization algorithms can be converted into
feedback controllers to enable robust "closed-loop optimization". In this article, we review
several research streams that have been pursued in this direction, including extremum seeking
and pertinent methods from model predictive and process control. However, our focus lies on recent
methods under the name of "feedback-based optimization". This research stream studies control
designs that directly implement optimization algorithms in closed loop with physical systems.
Such ideas are finding widespread application in the design and retrofit of control protocols for
communication networks and electricity grids. In addition to an overview over continuous-time
dynamical systems for optimization, our particular emphasis lies on closed-loop stability as
well as the enforcement of physical and operational constraints in closed-loop implementations.
We further illustrate these methods in the context of classical problems, namely congestion control
in communication networks and optimal frequency control in electricity grids, and we highlight
one potential future application in the form of autonomous reserve dispatch in power systems.

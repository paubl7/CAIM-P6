This year marks the eightieth anniversary of the invention of the finite element method (FEM). FEM
has become the computational workhorse for engineering design analysis and scientific modeling
of a wide range of physical processes, including material and structural mechanics, fluid flow
and heat conduction, various biological processes for medical diagnosis and surgery planning,
electromagnetics and semi-conductor circuit and chip design and analysis, additive manufacturing,
i.e. virtually every conceivable problem that can be described by partial differential equations
(PDEs). FEM has fundamentally revolutionized the way we do scientific modeling and engineering
design, ranging from automobiles, aircraft, marine structures, bridges, highways, and high-rise
buildings. Associated with the development of finite element methods has been the concurrent development
of an engineering science discipline called computational mechanics, or computational science
and engineering. In this paper, we present a historical perspective on the developments of finite
element methods mainly focusing on its applications and related developments in solid and structural
mechanics, with limited discussions to other fields in which it has made significant impact, such
as fluid mechanics, heat transfer, and fluid-structure interaction. To have a complete storyline,
we divide the development of the finite element method into four time periods: I. (1941-1965) Early
years of FEM; II. (1966-1991) Golden age of FEM; III. (1992-2017) Large scale, industrial applications
of FEM and development of material modeling, and IV (2018-) the state-of-the-art FEM technology
for the current and future eras of FEM research. Note that this paper may not strictly follow the chronological
order of FEM developments, because often time these developments were interwoven across different
time periods.

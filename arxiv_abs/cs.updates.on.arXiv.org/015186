Owning to the sub-standards being developed by IEEE Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) Task Group,
the traditional IEEE 802.1 Ethernet is enhanced to support real-time dependable communications
for future time- and safety-critical applications. Several sub-standards have been recently
proposed that introduce various traffic shapers (e.g., Time-Aware Shaper (TAS), Asynchronous
Traffic Shaper (ATS), Credit-Based Shaper (CBS), Strict Priority (SP)) for flow control mechanisms
of queuing and scheduling, targeting different application requirements. These shapers can be
used in isolation or in combination and there is limited work that analyzes, evaluates and compares
their performance, which makes it challenging for end-users to choose the right combination for
their applications. This paper aims at (i) quantitatively comparing various traffic shapers and
their combinations, (ii) summarizing, classifying and extending the architectures of individual
and combined traffic shapers and their Network calculus (NC)-based performance analysis methods
and (iii) filling the gap in the timing analysis research on handling two novel hybrid architectures
of combined traffic shapers, i.e., TAS+ATS+SP and TAS+ATS+CBS. A large number of experiments,
using both synthetic and realistic test cases, are carried out for quantitative performance comparisons
of various individual and combined traffic shapers, from the perspective of upper bounds of delay,
backlog and jitter. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to quantitatively compare the performance
of the main traffic shapers in TSN. The paper aims at supporting the researchers and practitioners
in the selection of suitable TSN sub-protocols for their use cases.

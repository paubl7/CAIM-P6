Nowadays, subsurface salt body localization and delineation, also called semantic segmentation
of salt bodies, are among the most challenging geophysicist tasks. Thus, identifying large salt
bodies is notoriously tricky and is crucial for identifying hydrocarbon reservoirs and drill path
planning. This work proposes a Data Augmentation method based on training two generative models
to augment the number of samples in a seismic image dataset for the semantic segmentation of salt
bodies. Our method uses deep learning models to generate pairs of seismic image patches and their
respective salt masks for the Data Augmentation. The first model is a Variational Autoencoder and
is responsible for generating patches of salt body masks. The second is a Conditional Normalizing
Flow model, which receives the generated masks as inputs and generates the associated seismic image
patches. We evaluate the proposed method by comparing the performance of ten distinct state-of-the-art
models for semantic segmentation, trained with and without the generated augmentations, in a dataset
from two synthetic seismic images. The proposed methodology yields an average improvement of 8.57%
in the IoU metric across all compared models. The best result is achieved by a DeeplabV3+ model variant,
which presents an IoU score of 95.17% when trained with our augmentations. Additionally, our proposal
outperformed six selected data augmentation methods, and the most significant improvement in
the comparison, of 9.77%, is achieved by composing our DA with augmentations from an elastic transformation.
At last, we show that the proposed method is adaptable for a larger context size by achieving results
comparable to the obtained on the smaller context size.

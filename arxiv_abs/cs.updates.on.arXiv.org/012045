The combinatorial auction (CA) is an efficient mechanism for resource allocation in different
fields, including cloud computing. It can obtain high economic efficiency and user flexibility
by allowing bidders to submit bids for combinations of different items instead of only for individual
items. However, the problem of allocating items among the bidders to maximize the auctioneers"
revenue, i.e., the winner determination problem (WDP), is NP-complete to solve and inapproximable.
Existing works for WDPs are generally based on mathematical optimization techniques and most of
them focus on the single-unit WDP, where each item only has one unit. On the contrary, few works consider
the multi-unit WDP in which each item may have multiple units. Given that the multi-unit WDP is more
complicated but prevalent in cloud computing, we propose leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques
to develop a novel low-complexity algorithm for solving this problem with negligible revenue loss.
Specifically, we model the multi-unit WDP as an augmented bipartite bid-item graph and use a graph
neural network (GNN) with half-convolution operations to learn the probability of each bid belonging
to the optimal allocation. To improve the sample generation efficiency and decrease the number
of needed labeled instances, we propose two different sample generation processes. We also develop
two novel graph-based post-processing algorithms to transform the outputs of the GNN into feasible
solutions. Through simulations on both synthetic instances and a specific virtual machine (VM)
allocation problem in a cloud computing platform, we validate that our proposed method can approach
optimal performance with low complexity and has good generalization ability in terms of problem
size and user-type distribution.

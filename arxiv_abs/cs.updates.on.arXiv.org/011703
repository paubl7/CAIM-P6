The objective of this analysis was to simulate the performance of three different ad-hoc protocols
for disruption-tolerant networking (DTN) - i.e. the transfer of information through a network
of nodes in contexts prone to signal interruption/signal degradation - and to perform a trade-off
analysis that will yield a recommendation of the best course of action (COA) for a user of a space-based
network to employ. This is important for space-based networks in particular since transmitting
information over long distances - e.g. from directly from the initial node to the destination node
- will result in the terminal signal being relatively weak, which is problematic in a high noise (disruption-prone)
environment since it will likely result in packet degradation or loss unless signal power is increased
to compensate. Given that changing signal power for each transmission is impractical when one's
network is located in space, optimization of the signal route is the best means of ensuring the transmitted
signal reaches its destination rapidly and with maximum fidelity. The recommended COA, as determined
at the end of the analysis, is one that optimizes performance in a fashion that minimizes error during
transmission and transmission time to the greatest extent possible. This analysis takes into consideration
the relative value of transmission time and transmission error for a user of space-based communication
systems (for instance, a scientific mission - the most likely type of user for a space-based relay
network - would prioritize data integrity much higher than transmission time since even though
a longer transmission time equals greater cost, a lower level of data integrity could result in the
mission's scientific objective being compromised) and provides a recommendation accordingly.

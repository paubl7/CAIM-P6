A boardroom election is an election with a small number of voters carried out with public communications.
We present BVOT, a self-tallying boardroom voting protocol with ballot secrecy, fairness (no tally
information is available before the polls close), and dispute-freeness (voters can observe that
all voters correctly followed the protocol). BVOT works by using a multiparty threshold homomorphic
encryption system in which each candidate is associated with a masked unique prime. Each voter engages
in an oblivious transfer with an untrusted distributor: the voter selects the index of a prime associated
with a candidate and receives the selected prime in masked form. The voter then casts their vote by
encrypting their masked prime and broadcasting it to everyone. The distributor does not learn the
voter's choice, and no one learns the mapping between primes and candidates until the audit phase.
By hiding the mapping between primes and candidates, BVOT provides voters with insufficient information
to carry out effective cheating. The threshold feature prevents anyone from computing any partial
tally---until everyone has voted. Multiplying all votes, their decryption shares, and the unmasking
factor yields a product of the primes each raised to the number of votes received. In contrast to some
existing boardroom voting protocols, BVOT does not rely on any zero-knowledge proof; instead,
it uses oblivious transfer to assure ballot secrecy and correct vote casting. Also, BVOT can handle
multiple candidates in one election. BVOT prevents cheating by hiding crucial information: an
attempt to increase the tally of one candidate might increase the tally of another candidate. After
all votes are cast, any party can tally the votes.

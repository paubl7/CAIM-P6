Modern top-performing object detectors depend heavily on backbone networks, whose advances bring
consistent performance gains through exploring more effective network structures. In this paper,
we propose a novel and flexible backbone framework, namely CBNetV2, to construct high-performance
detectors using existing open-sourced pre-trained backbones under the pre-training fine-tuning
paradigm. In particular, CBNetV2 architecture groups multiple identical backbones, which are
connected through composite connections. Specifically, it integrates the high- and low-level
features of multiple backbone networks and gradually expands the receptive field to more efficiently
perform object detection. We also propose a better training strategy with assistant supervision
for CBNet-based detectors. Without additional pre-training of the composite backbone, CBNetV2
can be adapted to various backbones (CNN-based vs. Transformer-based) and head designs of most
mainstream detectors (one-stage vs. two-stage, anchor-based vs. anchor-free-based). Experiments
provide strong evidence that, compared with simply increasing the depth and width of the network,
CBNetV2 introduces a more efficient, effective, and resource-friendly way to build high-performance
backbone networks. Particularly, our Dual-Swin-L achieves 59.4% box AP and 51.6% mask AP on COCO
test-dev under the single-model and single-scale testing protocol, which is significantly better
than the state-of-the-art result (57.7% box AP and 50.2% mask AP) achieved by Swin-L, while the training
schedule is reduced by 6$\times$. With multi-scale testing, we push the current best single model
result to a new record of 60.1% box AP and 52.3% mask AP without using extra training data. Code is available

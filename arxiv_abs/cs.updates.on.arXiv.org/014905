One of the main challenges in times of sanitary emergency is to quickly develop computer aided diagnosis
systems with a limited number of available samples due to the novelty, complexity of the case and
the urgency of its implementation. This is the case during the current pandemic of COVID-19. This
pathogen primarily infects the respiratory system of the afflicted, resulting in pneumonia and
in a severe case of acute respiratory distress syndrome. This results in the formation of different
pathological structures in the lungs that can be detected by the use of chest X-rays. Due to the overload
of the health services, portable X-ray devices are recommended during the pandemic, preventing
the spread of the disease. However, these devices entail different complications (such as capture
quality) that, together with the subjectivity of the clinician, make the diagnostic process more
difficult and suggest the necessity for computer-aided diagnosis methodologies despite the scarcity
of samples available to do so. To solve this problem, we propose a methodology that allows to adapt
the knowledge from a well-known domain with a high number of samples to a new domain with a significantly
reduced number and greater complexity. We took advantage of a pre-trained segmentation model from
brain magnetic resonance imaging of a unrelated pathology and performed two stages of knowledge
transfer to obtain a robust system able to segment lung regions from portable X-ray devices despite
the scarcity of samples and lesser quality. This way, our methodology obtained a satisfactory accuracy
of $0.9761 \pm 0.0100$ for patients with COVID-19, $0.9801 \pm 0.0104$ for normal patients and $0.9769
\pm 0.0111$ for patients with pulmonary diseases with similar characteristics as COVID-19 (such
as pneumonia) but not genuine COVID-19.

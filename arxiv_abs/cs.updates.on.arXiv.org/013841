Peer review is widely regarded as essential for advancing scientific research. However, reviewers
may be biased by authors' prestige or other characteristics. Double-blind peer review, in which
the authors' identities are masked from the reviewers, has been proposed as a way to reduce reviewer
bias. Although intuitive, evidence for the effectiveness of double-blind peer review in reducing
bias is limited and mixed. Here, we examine the effects of double-blind peer review on prestige bias
by analyzing the peer review files of 5027 papers submitted to the International Conference on Learning
Representations (ICLR), a top computer science conference that changed its reviewing policy from
single-blind peer review to double-blind peer review in 2018. We find that after switching to double-blind
review, the scores given to the most prestigious authors significantly decreased. However, because
many of these papers were above the threshold for acceptance, the change did not affect paper acceptance
decisions significantly. Nevertheless, we show that double-blind peer review may have improved
the quality of the selections by limiting other (non-author-prestige) biases. Specifically,
papers rejected in the single-blind format are cited more than those rejected under the double-blind
format, suggesting that double-blind review better identifies poorer quality papers. Interestingly,
an apparently unrelated change - the change of rating scale from 10 to 4 points - likely reduced prestige
bias significantly, to an extent that affected papers' acceptance. These results provide some
support for the effectiveness of double-blind review in reducing prestige bias, while opening
new research directions on the impact of peer review formats.

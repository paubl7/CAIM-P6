Low-code software development (LCSD) is an emerging paradigm that combines minimal source code
with interactive graphical interfaces to promote rapid application development. LCSD aims to
democratize application development to software practitioners with diverse backgrounds. Given
that LCSD is relatively a new paradigm, it is vital to learn about the challenges developers face
during their adoption of LCSD platforms. The online developer forum, Stack Overflow (SO), is popular
among software developers to ask for solutions to their technical problems. We observe a growing
body of posts in SO with discussions of LCSD platforms. In this paper, we present an empirical study
of around 5K SO posts (questions + accepted answers) that contain discussions of nine popular LCSD
platforms. We apply topic modeling on the posts to determine the types of topics discussed. We find
13 topics related to LCSD in SO. The 13 topics are grouped into four categories: Customization, Platform
Adoption, Database Management, and Third-Party Integration. More than 40% of the questions are
about customization, i.e., developers frequently face challenges with customizing user interfaces
or services offered by LCSD platforms. The topic "Dynamic Event Handling" under the "Customization"
category is the most popular (in terms of average view counts per question of the topic) as well as
the most difficult. It means that developers frequently search for customization solutions such
as how to attach dynamic events to a form in low-code UI, yet most (75.9%) of their questions remain
without an accepted answer. We manually label 900 questions from the posts to determine the prevalence
of the topics' challenges across LCSD phases. We find that most of the questions are related to the
development phase, and low-code developers also face challenges with automated testing.

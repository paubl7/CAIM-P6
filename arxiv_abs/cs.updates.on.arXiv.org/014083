Generative models are widely used for publishing synthetic datasets. Despite practical successes,
recent works have shown that generative models may leak privacy of the data that have been used during
training. Specifically, membership inference attacks aim to determine whether a sample has been
used in the training set given query access to the model API. However, many of the attacks designed
against generative models need to know very specific attributes from the learned models (e.g. discriminator
scores, generated images, etc.). Furthermore, many of these attacks are only heuristic-based
and do not provide effective bounds for privacy loss. In this work, we formally study the membership
privacy leakage risk of generative models and propose a membership privacy estimation framework.
We formulate membership privacy as a statistical divergence between training samples and hold-out
samples, and propose sample-based methods to estimate this divergence. Unlike previous works,
our proposed metric and estimators make realistic and flexible assumptions. First, we use a generalizable
metric as an alternative to accuracy, since practical model training often leads to imbalanced
train/hold-out splits. Second, our estimators are capable of estimating statistical divergence
using any scalar or vector valued attributes from the learned model instead of very specific attributes.
This allows our framework to provide data-driven certificates for trained generative models.
Finally, we show a connection to differential privacy which allows our proposed estimators to be
used to understand the privacy budget needed for differentially private generative models. We
demonstrate the utility of our framework through experimental demonstrations on different generative
models using various model attributes yielding some new insights about membership leakage and
vulnerabilities of models.

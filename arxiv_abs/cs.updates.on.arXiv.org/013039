Consider an input consisting of a set of $n$ disjoint triangular obstacles in $\mathbb{R}^3$ and
a target point $t$ in the free space, all enclosed by a large sphere $S$ of radius $R$ centered at $t$.
An articulated probe is modeled as two line segments $ab$ and $bc$ connected at point $b$. The length
of $ab$ can be equal to or greater than $R$, while $bc$ is of a given length $r \leq R$. The probe is initially
located outside $S$, assuming an unarticulated configuration, in which $ab$ and $bc$ are collinear
and $b \in ac$. The goal is to find a feasible (obstacle-avoiding) probe trajectory to reach $t$,
with the condition that the probe is constrained by the following sequence of moves -- a straight-line
insertion of the unarticulated probe into $S$, possibly followed by a rotation of $bc$ at $b$ for
at most $\pi/2$ radians, so that $c$ coincides with $t$. We prove that if there exists a feasible probe
trajectory, then a set of extremal feasible trajectories must be present. Through careful case
analysis, we show that these extremal trajectories can be represented by $O(n^4)$ combinatorial
events. We present a solution approach that enumerates and verifies these combinatorial events
for feasibility in overall $O(n^{4+\epsilon})$ time using $O(n^{4+\epsilon})$ space, for any
constant $\epsilon > 0$. The enumeration algorithm is highly parallel, considering that each combinatorial
event can be generated and verified for feasibility independently of the others. In the process
of deriving our solution, we design the first data structure for addressing a special instance of
circular sector emptiness queries among polyhedral obstacles in three dimensional space, and
provide a simplified data structure for the corresponding emptiness query problem in two dimensions.

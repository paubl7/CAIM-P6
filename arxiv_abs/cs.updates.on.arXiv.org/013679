Layer decomposition to separate an input image into base and detail layers has been steadily used
for image restoration. Existing residual networks based on an additive model require residual
layers with a small output range for fast convergence and visual quality improvement. However,
in inverse halftoning, homogenous dot patterns hinder a small output range from the residual layers.
Therefore, a new layer decomposition network based on the Gaussian convolution model (GCM) and
structure-aware deblurring strategy is presented to achieve residual learning for both the base
and detail layers. For the base layer, a new GCM-based residual subnetwork is presented. The GCM
utilizes a statistical distribution, in which the image difference between a blurred continuous-tone
image and a blurred halftoned image with a Gaussian filter can result in a narrow output range. Subsequently,
the GCM-based residual subnetwork uses a Gaussian-filtered halftoned image as input and outputs
the image difference as residual, thereby generating the base layer, i.e., the Gaussian-blurred
continuous-tone image. For the detail layer, a new structure-aware residual deblurring subnetwork
(SARDS) is presented. To remove the Gaussian blurring of the base layer, the SARDS uses the predicted
base layer as input and outputs the deblurred version. To more effectively restore image structures
such as lines and texts, a new image structure map predictor is incorporated into the deblurring
network to induce structure-adaptive learning. This paper provides a method to realize the residual
learning of both the base and detail layers based on the GCM and SARDS. In addition, it is verified
that the proposed method surpasses state-of-the-art methods based on U-Net, direct deblurring
networks, and progressively residual networks.

Medical imaging technologies, including computed tomography (CT) or chest X-Ray (CXR), are largely
employed to facilitate the diagnosis of the COVID-19. Since manual report writing is usually too
time-consuming, a more intelligent auxiliary medical system that could generate medical reports
automatically and immediately is urgently needed. In this article, we propose to use the medical
visual language BERT (Medical-VLBERT) model to identify the abnormality on the COVID-19 scans
and generate the medical report automatically based on the detected lesion regions. To produce
more accurate medical reports and minimize the visual-and-linguistic differences, this model
adopts an alternate learning strategy with two procedures that are knowledge pretraining and transferring.
To be more precise, the knowledge pretraining procedure is to memorize the knowledge from medical
texts, while the transferring procedure is to utilize the acquired knowledge for professional
medical sentences generations through observations of medical images. In practice, for automatic
medical report generation on the COVID-19 cases, we constructed a dataset of 368 medical findings
in Chinese and 1104 chest CT scans from The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University, Guangzhou,
China, and The Fifth Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University, Zhuhai, China. Besides, to
alleviate the insufficiency of the COVID-19 training samples, our model was first trained on the
large-scale Chinese CX-CHR dataset and then transferred to the COVID-19 CT dataset for further
fine-tuning. The experimental results showed that Medical-VLBERT achieved state-of-the-art
performances on terminology prediction and report generation with the Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset
and the CX-CHR dataset. The Chinese COVID-19 CT dataset is available at https://covid19ct.github.io/.

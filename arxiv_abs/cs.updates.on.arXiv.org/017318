A mass-conservative Lagrange--Galerkin scheme of second order in time for convection-diffusion
problems is presented, and convergence with optimal error estimates is proved in the framework
of $L^2$-theory. The introduced scheme maintains the advantages of the Lagrange--Galerkin method,
i.e., CFL-free robustness for convection-dominated problems and a symmetric and positive coefficient
matrix resulting from the discretization. In addition, the scheme conserves the mass on the discrete
level. Unconditional stability and error estimates of second order in time are proved by employing
two new key lemmas on the truncation error of the material derivative in conservative form and on
a discrete Gronwall inequality for multistep methods. The mass-conservation property is achieved
by the Jacobian multiplication technique introduced by Rui and Tabata in 2010, and the accuracy
of second order in time is obtained based on the idea of the multistep Galerkin method along characteristics
originally introduced by Ewing and Russel in 1981. For the first time step, the mass-conservative
scheme of first order in time by Rui and Tabata in 2010 is employed, which is efficient and does not
cause any loss of convergence order in the $\ell^\infty(L^2)$- and $\ell^2(H^1_0)$-norms. For
the time increment $\Delta t$, the mesh size $h$ and a conforming finite element space of polynomial
degree $k$, the convergence order is of $O(\Delta t^2 + h^k)$ in the $\ell^\infty(L^2)\cap \ell^2(H^1_0)$-norm
and of $O(\Delta t^2 + h^{k+1})$ in the $\ell^\infty(L^2)$-norm if the duality argument can be employed.
Error estimates of $O(\Delta t^{3/2}+h^k)$ in discrete versions of the $L^\infty(H^1_0)$- and
$H^1(L^2)$-norm are additionally proved. Numerical results confirm the theoretical convergence
orders in one, two and three dimensions.

Spear Phishing is a harmful cyber-attack facing business and individuals worldwide. Considerable
research has been conducted recently into the use of Machine Learning (ML) techniques to detect
spear-phishing emails. ML-based solutions may suffer from zero-day attacks; unseen attacks unaccounted
for in the training data. As new attacks emerge, classifiers trained on older data are unable to detect
these new varieties of attacks resulting in increasingly inaccurate predictions. Spear Phishing
detection also faces scalability challenges due to the growth of the required features which is
proportional to the number of the senders within a receiver mailbox. This differs from traditional
phishing attacks which typically perform only a binary classification between phishing and benign
emails. Therefore, we devise a possible solution to these problems, named RAIDER: Reinforcement
AIded Spear Phishing DEtectoR. A reinforcement-learning based feature evaluation system that
can automatically find the optimum features for detecting different types of attacks. By leveraging
a reward and penalty system, RAIDER allows for autonomous features selection. RAIDER also keeps
the number of features to a minimum by selecting only the significant features to represent phishing
emails and detect spear-phishing attacks. After extensive evaluation of RAIDER over 11,000 emails
and across 3 attack scenarios, our results suggest that using reinforcement learning to automatically
identify the significant features could reduce the dimensions of the required features by 55% in
comparison to existing ML-based systems. It also improves the accuracy of detecting spoofing attacks
by 4% from 90% to 94%. In addition, RAIDER demonstrates reasonable detection accuracy even against
a sophisticated attack named Known Sender in which spear-phishing emails greatly resemble those
of the impersonated sender.

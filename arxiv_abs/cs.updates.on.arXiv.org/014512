While the requirements for reliability increasing rapidly in distributed systems, byzantine
fault tolerance protocols have attracted more and more attention for the ability to tolerate arbitrary
failures. Although traditional BFT protocols have achieved significant performance improvements
after decades of research, they still cannot meet the increasing scalability requirements. Thanks
to the recent development of trusted execution environment, researchers have opportunities to
improve BFT protocols with hardware assistance, including increasing the ratio of byzantine nodes
that the system can tolerate and improving the scalability of the system. However, existing TEE-based
BFT protocols are mostly designed via improving traditional BFT protocols and using complex operations
to overcome security issues introduced by TEE, which makes the protocols difficult to understand
and implement. In fact, after introducing TEE, many byzantine failures can be eliminated naturally
so that the adversary assumption of TEE-based BFT is more similar to CFT rather than traditional
BFT. Therefore, it would be better to design a TEE-based BFT protocol on the basis of CFT protocols
to inherit the advantages of CFT, i.e., understandable and efficient. In this paper, we summarize
the key differences between TEE-based BFT and CFT protocols and propose four principles to help
bridge the gap between TEE-based BFT and CFT. Based on these principles, we present TBFT, a novel
TEE-based BFT protocol with inspirations from CFT protocols, which is simple and understandable
enough to be applied in practice. Besides, we make comprehensive improvements to TBFT for both performance
and security, including pipeline mechanisms, TEE-assisted secret sharing, and trusted leader
election. Our evaluation shows that TBFT has better performance and scalability compared to previous
protocols.

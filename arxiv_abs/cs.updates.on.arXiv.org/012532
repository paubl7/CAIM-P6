Modeling patient disease progression using Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is critical to assist
clinical decision making. While most of prior work has mainly focused on developing effective disease
progression models using EHRs collected from an individual medical system, relatively little
work has investigated building robust yet generalizable diagnosis models across different systems.
In this work, we propose a general domain adaptation (DA) framework that tackles two categories
of discrepancies in EHRs collected from different medical systems: one is caused by heterogeneous
patient populations (covariate shift) and the other is caused by variations in data collection
procedures (systematic bias). Prior research in DA has mainly focused on addressing covariate
shift but not systematic bias. In this work, we propose an adversarial domain separation framework
that addresses both categories of discrepancies by maintaining one globally-shared invariant
latent representation across all systems} through an adversarial learning process, while also
allocating a domain-specific model for each system to extract local latent representations that
cannot and should not be unified across systems. Moreover, our proposed framework is based on variational
recurrent neural network (VRNN) because of its ability to capture complex temporal dependencies
and handling missing values in time-series data. We evaluate our framework for early diagnosis
of an extremely challenging condition, septic shock, using two real-world EHRs from distinct medical
systems in the U.S. The results show that by separating globally-shared from domain-specific representations,
our framework significantly improves septic shock early prediction performance in both EHRs and
outperforms the current state-of-the-art DA models.

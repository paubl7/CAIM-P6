The application of microscopy in biomedical research has come a long way since Antonie van Leeuwenhoek
discovered unicellular organisms. Countless innovations have positioned light microscopy as
a cornerstone of modern biology and a method of choice for connecting omics datasets to their biological
and clinical correlates. Still, regardless of how convincing published imaging data looks, it
does not always convey meaningful information about the conditions in which it was acquired, processed,
and analyzed. Adequate record-keeping, reporting, and quality control are therefore essential
to ensure experimental rigor and data fidelity, allow experiments to be reproducibly repeated,
and promote the proper evaluation, interpretation, comparison, and re-use. To this end, microscopy
images should be accompanied by complete descriptions detailing experimental procedures, biological
samples, microscope hardware specifications, image acquisition parameters, and image analysis
procedures, as well as metrics accounting for instrument performance and calibration. However,
universal, community-accepted Microscopy Metadata standards and reporting specifications
that would result in Findable Accessible Interoperable and Reproducible (FAIR) microscopy data
have not yet been established. To understand this shortcoming and to propose a way forward, here
we provide an overview of the nature of microscopy metadata and its importance for fostering data
quality, reproducibility, scientific rigor, and sharing value in light microscopy. The proposal
for tiered Microscopy Metadata Specifications that extend the OME Data Model put forth by the 4D
Nucleome Initiative and by Bioimaging North America [1-3] as well as a suite of three complementary
and interoperable tools are being developed to facilitate the process of image data documentation
and are presented in related manuscripts [4-6].

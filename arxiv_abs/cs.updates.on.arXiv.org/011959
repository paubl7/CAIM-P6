In this paper, we study resource allocation algorithm design for multi-user orthogonal frequency
division multiple access (OFDMA) ultra-reliable low latency communication (URLLC) in mobile
edge computing (MEC) systems. To meet the stringent end-to-end delay and reliability requirements
of URLLC MEC systems, we propose joint uplink-downlink resource allocation and finite blocklength
transmission. Furthermore, we employ a partial time overlap between the uplink and downlink frames
to minimize the end-to-end delay, which introduces a new time causality constraint. The proposed
resource allocation algorithm is formulated as an optimization problem for minimization of the
total weighted power consumption of the network under a constraint on the number of URLLC user bits
computed within the maximum allowable computation time, i.e., the end-to-end delay of a computation
task. Despite the non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem, we develop a globally
optimal solution using a branch-and-bound approach based on discrete monotonic optimization
theory. The branch-and-bound algorithm minimizes an upper bound on the total power consumption
until convergence to the globally optimal value. Furthermore, to strike a balance between computational
complexity and performance, we propose two efficient suboptimal algorithms based on successive
convex approximation and second-order cone techniques. Our simulation results reveal that the
proposed resource allocation algorithm design facilitates URLLC in MEC systems, and yields significant
power savings compared to three baseline schemes. Moreover, our simulation results show that the
proposed suboptimal algorithms offer different trade-offs between performance and complexity
and attain a close-to-optimal performance at comparatively low complexity.

We propose a new machine-learning approach for fiber-optic communication systems whose signal
propagation is governed by the nonlinear Schr\"odinger equation (NLSE). Our main observation
is that the popular split-step method (SSM) for numerically solving the NLSE has essentially the
same functional form as a deep multi-layer neural network; in both cases, one alternates linear
steps and pointwise nonlinearities. We exploit this connection by parameterizing the SSM and viewing
the linear steps as general linear functions, similar to the weight matrices in a neural network.
The resulting physics-based machine-learning model has several advantages over "black-box"
function approximators. For example, it allows us to examine and interpret the learned solutions
in order to understand why they perform well. As an application, low-complexity nonlinear equalization
is considered, where the task is to efficiently invert the NLSE. This is commonly referred to as digital
backpropagation (DBP). Rather than employing neural networks, the proposed algorithm, dubbed
learned DBP (LDBP), uses the physics-based model with trainable filters in each step and its complexity
is reduced by progressively pruning filter taps during gradient descent. Our main finding is that
the filters can be pruned to remarkably short lengths-as few as 3 taps/step-without sacrificing
performance. As a result, the complexity can be reduced by orders of magnitude in comparison to prior
work. By inspecting the filter responses, an additional theoretical justification for the learned
parameter configurations is provided. Our work illustrates that combining data-driven optimization
with existing domain knowledge can generate new insights into old communications problems.

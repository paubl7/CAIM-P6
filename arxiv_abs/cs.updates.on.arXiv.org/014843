Lattice-Boltzmann methods are known for their simplicity, efficiency and ease of parallelization,
usually relying on uniform Cartesian meshes with a strong bond between spatial and temporal discretization.
This fact complicates the crucial issue of reducing the computational cost and the memory impact
by automatically coarsening the grid where a fine mesh is unnecessary, still ensuring the overall
quality of the numerical solution through error control. This work provides a possible answer to
this interesting question, by connecting, for the first time, the field of lattice-Boltzmann Methods
(LBM) to the adaptive multiresolution (MR) approach based on wavelets. To this end, we employ a MR
multi-scale transform to adapt the mesh as the solution evolves in time according to its local regularity.
The collision phase is not affected due to its inherent local nature and because we do not modify the
speed of the sound, contrarily to most of the LBM/Adaptive Mesh Refinement (AMR) strategies proposed
in literature, thus preserving the original structure of any LBM scheme. Besides, an original use
of the MR allows the scheme to resolve the proper physics by efficiently controlling the accuracy
of the transport phase. We carefully test our method to conclude on its adaptability to a wide family
of existing lattice Boltzmann schemes, treating both hyperbolic and parabolic systems of equation,
thus being less problem-dependent than the AMR approaches, which have a hard time granting an effective
control on the error. The ability of the method to yield a very efficient compression rate and thus
a computational cost reduction for solutions involving localized structures with loss of regularity
is also shown, while guaranteeing a precise control on the approximation error introduced by the
spatial adaptation of the mesh. The numerical strategy is implemented on a specific open-source
platform called SAMURAI with a dedicated data-structure relying on set algebra.

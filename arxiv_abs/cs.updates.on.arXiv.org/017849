The unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) has emerged as a promising solution to provide delivery and other
mobile services to customers rapidly, yet it drains its stored energy quickly when travelling on
the way and (even if solar-powered) it takes time for charging power on the way before reaching the
destination. To address this issue, existing works focus more on UAV's path planning with designated
system vehicles providing charging service. However, in some emergency cases and rural areas where
system vehicles are not available, public trucks can provide more feasible and cost-saving services
and hence a silver lining. In this paper, we explore how a single UAV can save flying distance by exploiting
public trucks, to minimize the travel time of the UAV. We give the first theoretical work studying
online algorithms for the problem, which guarantees a worst-case performance. We first consider
the offline problem knowing future truck trip information far ahead of time. By delicately transforming
the problem into a graph satisfying both time and power constraints, we present a shortest-path
algorithm that outputs the optimal solution of the problem. Then, we proceed to the online setting
where trucks appear in real-time and only inform the UAV of their trip information some certain time
$\Delta t$ beforehand. As a benchmark, we propose a well-constructed lower bound that an online
algorithm could achieve. We propose an online algorithm MyopicHitching that greedily takes truck
trips and an improved algorithm $\Delta t$-Adaptive that further tolerates a waiting time in taking
a ride. Our theoretical analysis shows that $\Delta t$-Adaptive is asymptotically optimal in the
sense that its ratio approaches the proposed lower bounds as $\Delta t$ increases.

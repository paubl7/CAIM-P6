Multivariate time-series data are used in many classification and regression predictive tasks,
and recurrent models have been widely used for such tasks. Most common recurrent models assume that
time-series data elements are of equal length and the ordered observations are recorded at regular
intervals. However, real-world time-series data have neither a similar length nor a same number
of observations. They also have missing entries, which hinders the performance of predictive tasks.
In this paper, we approach these issues by presenting a model for the combined task of imputing and
predicting values for the irregularly observed and varying length time-series data with missing
entries. Our proposed model (Bi-GAN) uses a bidirectional recurrent network in a generative adversarial
setting. The generator is a bidirectional recurrent network that receives actual incomplete data
and imputes the missing values. The discriminator attempts to discriminate between the actual
and the imputed values in the output of the generator. Our model learns how to impute missing elements
in-between (imputation) or outside of the input time steps (prediction), hence working as an effective
any-time prediction tool for time-series data. Our method has three advantages to the state-of-the-art
methods in the field: (a) single model can be used for both imputation and prediction tasks; (b) it
can perform prediction task for time-series of varying length with missing data; (c) it does not
require to know the observation and prediction time window during training which provides a flexible
length of prediction window for both long-term and short-term predictions. We evaluate our model
on two public datasets and on another large real-world electronic health records dataset to impute
and predict body mass index (BMI) values in children and show its superior performance in both settings.

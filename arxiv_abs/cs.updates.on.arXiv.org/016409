The Ebola virus and the disease in effect tend to randomly move individuals in the population around
susceptible, infected, quarantined, hospitalized, recovered, and dead sub-population. Motivated
by the effectiveness in propagating the disease through the virus, a new bio-inspired and population-based
optimization algorithm is proposed. This paper presents a novel metaheuristic algorithm named
Ebola optimization algorithm (EOSA). To correctly achieve this, this study models the propagation
mechanism of the Ebola virus disease, emphasising all consistent states of the propagation. The
model was further represented using a mathematical model based on first-order differential equations.
After that, the combined propagation and mathematical models were adapted for developing the new
metaheuristic algorithm. To evaluate the proposed method's performance and capability compared
with other optimization methods, the underlying propagation and mathematical models were first
investigated to determine how they successfully simulate the EVD. Furthermore, two sets of benchmark
functions consisting of forty-seven (47) classical and over thirty (30) constrained IEEE CEC-2017
benchmark functions are investigated numerically. The results indicate that the performance
of the proposed algorithm is competitive with other state-of-the-art optimization methods based
on scalability analysis, convergence analysis, and sensitivity analysis. Extensive simulation
results indicate that the EOSA outperforms other state-of-the-art popular metaheuristic optimization
algorithms such as the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm (PSO), Genetic Algorithm (GA), and
Artificial Bee Colony Algorithm (ABC) on some shifted, high dimensional and large search range
problems.

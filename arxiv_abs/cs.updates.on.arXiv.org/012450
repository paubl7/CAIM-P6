Broadcasting in wireless networks is vulnerable to adversarial jamming. To thwart such behavior,
\emph{resource competitive analysis} is proposed. In this framework, sending, listening, or
jamming on one channel for one time slot costs one unit of energy. The adversary can employ arbitrary
strategy to disrupt communication, but has a limited energy budget $T$. The honest nodes, on the
other hand, aim to accomplish broadcast while spending only $o(T)$. Previous work has shown, in
a $C$-channels network containing $n$ nodes, for large $T$ values, each node can receive the message
in $\tilde{O}(T/C)$ time, while spending only $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T/n})$ energy. However, these
multi-channel algorithms only work for certain values of $n$ and $C$, and can only tolerate an oblivious
adversary. In this work, we provide new upper and lower bounds for broadcasting in multi-channel
radio networks, from the perspective of resource competitiveness. Our algorithms work for arbitrary
$n,C$ values, require minimal prior knowledge, and can tolerate a powerful adaptive adversary.
More specifically, in our algorithms, for large $T$ values, each node's runtime is $O(T/C)$, and
each node's energy cost is $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{T/n})$. We also complement algorithmic results with
lower bounds, proving both the time complexity and the energy complexity of our algorithms are optimal
or near-optimal (within a poly-log factor). Our technical contributions lie in using "epidemic
broadcast" to achieve time efficiency and resource competitiveness, and employing coupling techniques
in the analysis to handle the adaptivity of the adversary. At the lower bound side, we first derive
a new energy complexity lower bound for 1-to-1 communication in the multi-channel setting, and
then apply simulation and reduction arguments to obtain the desired result.

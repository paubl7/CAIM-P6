Gamification has been used to motivate and engage participants in software engineering education
and practice activities. There is a significant demand for empirical studies for the understanding
of the impacts and efficacy of gamification. However, the lack of standard procedures and models
for the evaluation of gamification is a challenge for the design, comparison, and report of results
related to the assessment of gamification approaches and its effects. The goal of this study is to
identify models and strategies for the evaluation of gamification reported in the literature.
To achieve this goal, we conducted a systematic mapping study to investigate strategies for the
evaluation of gamification in the context of software engineering. We selected 100 primary studies
on gamification in software engineering (from 2011 to 2020). We categorized the studies regarding
the presence of evaluation procedures or models for the evaluation of gamification, the purpose
of the evaluation, the criteria used, the type of data, instruments, and procedures for data analysis.
Our results show that 64 studies report procedures for the evaluation of gamification. However,
only three studies actually propose evaluation models for gamification. We observed that the evaluation
of gamification focuses on two aspects: the evaluation of the gamification strategy itself, related
to the user experience and perceptions; and the evaluation of the outcomes and effects of gamification
on its users and context. The most recurring criteria for the evaluation are 'engagement', 'motivation',
'satisfaction', and 'performance'. Finally, the evaluation of gamification requires a mix of
subjective and objective inputs, and qualitative and quantitative data analysis approaches.
Depending of the focus of the evaluation (the strategy or the outcomes), there is a predominance
of a type of data and analysis.

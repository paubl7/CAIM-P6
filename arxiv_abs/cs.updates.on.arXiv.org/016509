Highly directional millimeter wave (mmWave) radios need to perform beam management to establish
and maintain reliable links. To do so, existing solutions mostly rely on explicit coordination
between the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX), which significantly reduces the airtime available
for communication and further complicates the network protocol design. This paper advances the
state of the art by presenting DeepBeam, a framework for beam management that does not require pilot
sequences from the TX, nor any beam sweeping or synchronization from the RX. This is achieved by inferring
(i) the Angle of Arrival (AoA) of the beam and (ii) the actual beam being used by the transmitter through
waveform-level deep learning on ongoing transmissions between the TX to other receivers. In this
way, the RX can associate Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (SNR) levels to beams without explicit coordination
with the TX. This is possible because different beam patterns introduce different impairments
to the waveform, which can be subsequently learned by a convolutional neural network (CNN). We conduct
an extensive experimental data collection campaign where we collect more than 4 TB of mmWave waveforms
with (i) 4 phased array antennas at 60.48 GHz, (ii) 2 codebooks containing 24 one-dimensional beams
and 12 two-dimensional beams; (iii) 3 receiver gains; (iv) 3 different AoAs; (v) multiple TX and
RX locations. Moreover, we collect waveform data with two custom-designed mmWave software-defined
radios with fully-digital beamforming architectures at 58 GHz. Results show that DeepBeam (i)
achieves accuracy of up to 96%, 84% and 77% with a 5-beam, 12-beam and 24-beam codebook, respectively;
(ii) reduces latency by up to 7x with respect to the 5G NR initial beam sweep in a default configuration
and with a 12-beam codebook. The waveform dataset and the full DeepBeam code repository are publicly
available.

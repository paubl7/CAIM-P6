One of the major problems writers and poets face is the writer's block. It is a condition in which an
author loses the ability to produce new work or experiences a creative slowdown. The problem is more
difficult in the context of poetry than prose, as in the latter case authors need not be very concise
while expressing their ideas, also the various aspects such as rhyme, poetic meters are not relevant
for prose. One of the most effective ways to overcome this writing block for poets can be, to have a
prompt system, which would help their imagination and open their minds for new ideas. A prompt system
can possibly generate one liner, two liner or full ghazals. The purpose of this work is to give an ode
to the Urdu, Hindi poets, and helping them start their next line of poetry, a couplet or a complete
ghazal considering various factors like rhymes, refrain, and meters. The result will help aspiring
poets to get new ideas and help them overcome writer's block by auto-generating pieces of poetry
using Deep Learning techniques. A concern with creative works like this, especially in the literary
context, is to ensure that the output is not plagiarized. This work also addresses the concern and
makes sure that the resulting odes are not exact match with input data using parameters like temperature
and manual plagiarism check against input corpus. To the best of our knowledge, although the automatic
text generation problem has been studied quite extensively in the literature, the specific problem
of Urdu, Hindi poetry generation has not been explored much. Apart from developing system to auto-generate
Urdu, Hindi poetry, another key contribution of our work is to create a cleaned and preprocessed
corpus of Urdu, Hindi poetry (derived from authentic resources) and making it freely available
for researchers in the area.

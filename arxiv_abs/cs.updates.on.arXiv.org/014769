Entities are at the center of how we represent and aggregate knowledge. For instance, Encyclopedias
such as Wikipedia are structured by entities (e.g., one per Wikipedia article). The ability to retrieve
such entities given a query is fundamental for knowledge-intensive tasks such as entity linking
and open-domain question answering. Current approaches can be understood as classifiers among
atomic labels, one for each entity. Their weight vectors are dense entity representations produced
by encoding entity meta information such as their descriptions. This approach has several shortcomings:
(i) context and entity affinity is mainly captured through a vector dot product, potentially missing
fine-grained interactions; (ii) a large memory footprint is needed to store dense representations
when considering large entity sets; (iii) an appropriately hard set of negative data has to be subsampled
at training time. In this work, we propose GENRE, the first system that retrieves entities by generating
their unique names, left to right, token-by-token in an autoregressive fashion. This mitigates
the aforementioned technical issues since: (i) the autoregressive formulation directly captures
relations between context and entity name, effectively cross encoding both; (ii) the memory footprint
is greatly reduced because the parameters of our encoder-decoder architecture scale with vocabulary
size, not entity count; (iii) the softmax loss is computed without subsampling negative data. We
experiment with more than 20 datasets on entity disambiguation, end-to-end entity linking and
document retrieval tasks, achieving new state-of-the-art or very competitive results while using
a tiny fraction of the memory footprint of competing systems. Finally, we demonstrate that new entities
can be added by simply specifying their names. Code and pre-trained models at https://github.com/facebookresearch/GENRE.

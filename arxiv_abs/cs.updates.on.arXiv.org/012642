In 2020, the SARS-CoV-2 virus causes a global pandemic of the new human coronavirus disease COVID-19.
This pathogen primarily infects the respiratory system of the afflicted, usually resulting in
pneumonia and in a severe case of acute respiratory distress syndrome. These disease developments
result in the formation of different pathological structures in the lungs, similar to those observed
in other viral pneumonias that can be detected by the use of chest X-rays. For this reason, the detection
and analysis of the pulmonary regions, the main focus of affection of COVID-19, becomes a crucial
part of both clinical and automatic diagnosis processes. Due to the overload of the health services,
portable X-ray devices are widely used, representing an alternative to fixed devices to reduce
the risk of cross-contamination. However, these devices entail different complications as the
image quality that, together with the subjectivity of the clinician, make the diagnostic process
more difficult. In this work, we developed a novel fully automatic methodology specially designed
for the identification of these lung regions in X-ray images of low quality as those from portable
devices. To do so, we took advantage of a large dataset from magnetic resonance imaging of a similar
pathology and performed two stages of transfer learning to obtain a robust methodology with a low
number of images from portable X-ray devices. This way, our methodology obtained a satisfactory
accuracy of $0.9761 \pm 0.0100$ for patients with COVID-19, $0.9801 \pm 0.0104$ for normal patients
and $0.9769 \pm 0.0111$ for patients with pulmonary diseases with similar characteristics as COVID-19
(such as pneumonia) but not genuine COVID-19.

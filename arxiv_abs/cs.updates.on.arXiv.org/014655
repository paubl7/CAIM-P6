The monitoring of rotating machinery is an essential task in today's production processes. Currently,
several machine learning and deep learning-based modules have achieved excellent results in fault
detection and diagnosis. Nevertheless, to further increase user adoption and diffusion of such
technologies, users and human experts must be provided with explanations and insights by the modules.
Another issue is related, in most cases, with the unavailability of labeled historical data that
makes the use of supervised models unfeasible. Therefore, a new approach for fault detection and
diagnosis in rotating machinery is here proposed. The methodology consists of three parts: feature
extraction, fault detection and fault diagnosis. In the first part, the vibration features in the
time and frequency domains are extracted. Secondly, in the fault detection, the presence of fault
is verified in an unsupervised manner based on anomaly detection algorithms. The modularity of
the methodology allows different algorithms to be implemented. Finally, in fault diagnosis, Shapley
Additive Explanations (SHAP), a technique to interpret black-box models, is used. Through the
feature importance ranking obtained by the model explainability, the fault diagnosis is performed.
Two tools for diagnosis are proposed, namely: unsupervised classification and root cause analysis.
The effectiveness of the proposed approach is shown on three datasets containing different mechanical
faults in rotating machinery. The study also presents a comparison between models used in machine
learning explainability: SHAP and Local Depth-based Feature Importance for the Isolation Forest
(Local- DIFFI). Lastly, an analysis of several state-of-art anomaly detection algorithms in rotating
machinery is included.

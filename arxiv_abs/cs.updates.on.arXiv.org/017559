This paper concerns designing distributed algorithms that are {\em singularly optimal}, i.e.,
algorithms that are {\em simultaneously} time and message {\em optimal}, for the fundamental leader
election problem in {\em asynchronous} networks. Kutten et al. (JACM 2015) presented a singularly
near optimal randomized leader election algorithm for general {\em synchronous} networks that
ran in $O(D)$ time and used $O(m \log n)$ messages (where $D$, $m$, and $n$ are the network's diameter,
number of edges and number of nodes, respectively) with high probability.\footnote{Throughout,
"with high probability" means "with probability at least $1-1/n^c$, for constant $c$."} Both bounds
are near optimal (up to a logarithmic factor), since $\Omega(D)$ and $\Omega(m)$ are the respective
lower bounds for time and messages for leader election even for synchronous networks and even for
(Monte-Carlo) randomized algorithms. On the other hand, for general asynchronous networks, leader
election algorithms are only known that are either time or message optimal, but not both. Kutten
et al. (DISC 2020) presented a randomized asynchronous leader election algorithm that is singularly
near optimal for \emph{complete networks}, but left open the problem for general networks. This
paper shows that singularly near optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) bounds can be achieved
for general {\em asynchronous} networks. We present a randomized singularly near optimal leader
election algorithm that runs in $O(D + \log^2n)$ time and $O(m\log^2 n)$ messages with high probability.
Our result is the first known distributed leader election algorithm for asynchronous networks
that is near optimal with respect to both time and message complexity and improves over a long line
of results including the classical results of Gallager et al. (ACM TOPLAS, 1983), Peleg (JPDC, 1989),
and Awerbuch (STOC 89).

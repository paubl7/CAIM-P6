Defects are unavoidable in casting production owing to the complexity of the casting process. While
conventional human-visual inspection of casting products is slow and unproductive in mass productions,
an automatic and reliable defect detection not just enhances the quality control process but positively
improves productivity. However, casting defect detection is a challenging task due to diversity
and variation in defects' appearance. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have been widely applied
in both image classification and defect detection tasks. Howbeit, CNNs with frequentist inference
require a massive amount of data to train on and still fall short in reporting beneficial estimates
of their predictive uncertainty. Accordingly, leveraging the transfer learning paradigm, we
first apply four powerful CNN-based models (VGG16, ResNet50, DenseNet121, and InceptionResNetV2)
on a small dataset to extract meaningful features. Extracted features are then processed by various
machine learning algorithms to perform the classification task. Simulation results demonstrate
that linear support vector machine (SVM) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP) show the finest performance
in defect detection of casting images. Secondly, to achieve a reliable classification and to measure
epistemic uncertainty, we employ an uncertainty quantification (UQ) technique (ensemble of MLP
models) using features extracted from four pre-trained CNNs. UQ confusion matrix and uncertainty
accuracy metric are also utilized to evaluate the predictive uncertainty estimates. Comprehensive
comparisons reveal that UQ method based on VGG16 outperforms others to fetch uncertainty. We believe
an uncertainty-aware automatic defect detection solution will reinforce casting productions
quality assurance.

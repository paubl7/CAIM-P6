This paper proposes a novel transmission policy for an intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) assisted
wireless powered sensor network (WPSN). An IRS is deployed to enhance the performance of wireless
energy transfer (WET) and wireless information transfer (WIT) by intelligently adjusting phase
shifts of each reflecting elements. To achieve its self-sustainability, the IRS needs to collect
energy from energy station to support its control circuit operation. Our proposed policy for the
considered WPSN is called IRS assisted harvest-then-transmit time switching, which is able to
schedule the transmission time slots by switching between energy collection and energy reflection
modes. We study the achievable sum throughput of the proposed transmission policy and investigate
a joint design of the transmission time slots, the power allocation, as well as the discrete phase
shifts of the WET and WIT. This formulates the problem as a mixed-integer non-linear program, which
is NP-hard and non-convex. We first relax it to one with continuous phase shifts, and then propose
a two-step approach and decompose the original problem into two sub-problems. We solve the first
sub-problem with respect to the phase shifts of the WIT in terms of closed-form expression. For the
second sub-problem, we consider a special case without the circuit power of each sensor node, the
Lagrange dual method and the KKT conditions are applied to derive the optimal closed-form transmission
time slots, power allocation, and phase shift of the WET. Then we generalise the case with the circuit
power of each sensor node, which can be solved via employing a semi-definite programming relaxation.
The optimal discrete phase shifts can be obtained by quantizing the continuous values. Numerical
results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed policy and validate the beneficial role
of the IRS in comparison to the benchmark schemes.

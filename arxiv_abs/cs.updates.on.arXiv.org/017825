There is currently a burgeoning demand for deploying deep learning (DL) models on ubiquitous edge
Internet of Things devices attributing to their low latency and high privacy preservation. However,
DL models are often large in size and require large-scale computation, which prevents them from
being placed directly onto IoT devices where resources are constrained and 32-bit floating-point
operations are unavailable. Model quantization is a pragmatic solution, which enables DL deployment
on mobile devices and embedded systems by effortlessly post-quantizing a large high-precision
model into a small low-precision model while retaining the model inference accuracy. This work
reveals that the standard quantization operation can be abused to activate a backdoor. We demonstrate
that a full-precision backdoored model that does not have any backdoor effect in the presence of
a trigger -- as the backdoor is dormant -- can be activated by the default TensorFlow-Lite quantization,
the only product-ready quantization framework to date. We ascertain that all trained float-32
backdoored models exhibit no backdoor effect even in the presence of trigger inputs. State-of-the-art
frontend detection approaches, such as Neural Cleanse and STRIP, fail to identify the backdoor
in the float-32 models. When each of the float-32 models is converted into an int-8 format model through
the standard TFLite post-training quantization, the backdoor is activated in the quantized model,
which shows a stable attack success rate close to 100% upon inputs with the trigger, while behaves
normally upon non-trigger inputs. This work highlights that a stealthy security threat occurs
when end users utilize the on-device post-training model quantization toolkits, informing security
researchers of cross-platform overhaul of DL models post quantization even if they pass frontend
inspections.

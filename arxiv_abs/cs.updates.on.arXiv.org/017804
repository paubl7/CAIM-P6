Efficient frequency-domain Full Waveform Inversion (FWI) of long-offset/wide-azimuth node
data can be designed with a few discrete frequencies. However, 3D frequency-domain seismic modeling
remains challenging since it requires solving a large and sparse linear indefinite system per frequency.
When such systems are solved with direct methods or hybrid direct/iterative solvers, based upon
domain decomposition preconditioner, finite-difference stencils on regular Cartesian grids
should be designed to conciliate compactness and accuracy, the former being necessary to mitigate
the fill-in induced by the Lower-Upper (LU) factorization. Compactness is classically implemented
by combining several second-order accurate stencils covering the eight cells surrounding the
collocation point, leading to the so-called 27-point stencil. Accuracy is obtained by applying
optimal weights on the different stiffness and consistent mass matrices such that numerical dispersion
is jointly minimized for several number of grid points per wavelength ($G$). However, with this
approach, the same weights are used at each collocation point, leading to suboptimal accuracy in
heterogeneous media. In this study, we propose a straightforward recipe to improve the accuracy
of the 27-point stencil. First, we finely tabulate the values of $G$ covering the range of wavelengths
spanned by the subsurface model and the frequency. Then, we estimate with a classical dispersion
analysis in homogeneous media the corresponding table of optimal weights that minimize dispersion
for each $G$ treated separately. We however apply a Tikhonov regularization to guarantee smooth
variation of the weights with $G$. Finally, we build the impedance matrix by selecting the optimal
weights at each collocation point according to the local wavelength, hence leading to a wavelength-adaptive
stencil.

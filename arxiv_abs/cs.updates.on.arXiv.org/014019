Contributions: The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK)-Jockey Club AI for the Future Project
(AI4Future) co-created an AI curriculum for pre-tertiary education and evaluated its efficacy.
While AI is conventionally taught in tertiary level education, our co-creation process successfully
developed the curriculum that has been used in secondary school teaching in Hong Kong and received
positive feedback. Background: AI4Future is a cross-sector project that engages five major partners
- CUHK Faculty of Engineering and Faculty of Education, Hong Kong secondary schools, the government
and the AI industry. A team of 14 professors with expertise in engineering and education collaborated
with 17 principals and teachers from 6 secondary schools to co-create the curriculum. This team
formation bridges the gap between researchers in engineering and education, together with practitioners
in education context. Research Questions: What are the main features of the curriculum content
developed through the co-creation process? Would the curriculum significantly improve the students
perceived competence in, as well as attitude and motivation towards AI? What are the teachers perceptions
of the co-creation process that aims to accommodate and foster teacher autonomy? Methodology:
This study adopted a mix of quantitative and qualitative methods and involved 335 student participants.
Findings: 1) two main features of learning resources, 2) the students perceived greater competence,
and developed more positive attitude to learn AI, and 3) the co-creation process generated a variety
of resources which enhanced the teachers knowledge in AI, as well as fostered teachers autonomy
in bringing the subject matter into their classrooms.

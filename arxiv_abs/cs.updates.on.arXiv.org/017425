With the development of end-to-end control based on deep learning, it is important to study new system
modeling techniques to realize dynamics modeling with high-dimensional inputs. In this paper,
a novel Koopman-based deep convolutional network, called CKNet, is proposed to identify latent
dynamics from raw pixels. CKNet learns an encoder and decoder to play the role of the Koopman eigenfunctions
and modes, respectively. The Koopman eigenvalues can be approximated by eigenvalues of the learned
state transition matrix. The deterministic convolutional Koopman network (DCKNet) and the variational
convolutional Koopman network (VCKNet) are proposed to span some subspace for approximating the
Koopman operator respectively. Because CKNet is trained under the constraints of the Koopman theory,
the identified latent dynamics is in a linear form and has good interpretability. Besides, the state
transition and control matrices are trained as trainable tensors so that the identified dynamics
is also time-invariant. We also design an auxiliary weight term for reducing multi-step linearity
and prediction losses. Experiments were conducted on two offline trained and four online trained
nonlinear forced dynamical systems with continuous action spaces in Gym and Mujoco environment
respectively, and the results show that identified dynamics are adequate for approximating the
latent dynamics and generating clear images. Especially for offline trained cases, this work confirms
CKNet from a novel perspective that we visualize the evolutionary processes of the latent states
and the Koopman eigenfunctions with DCKNet and VCKNet separately to each task based on the same episode
and results demonstrate that different approaches learn similar features in shapes.

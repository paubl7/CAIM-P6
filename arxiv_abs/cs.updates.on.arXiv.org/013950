Personalized gamification explores knowledge about the users to tailor gamification designs
to improve one-size-fits-all gamification. The tailoring process should simultaneously consider
user and contextual characteristics (e.g., activity to be done and geographic location), which
leads to several occasions to tailor. Consequently, tools for automating gamification personalization
are needed. The problems that emerge are that which of those characteristics are relevant and how
to do such tailoring are open questions, and that the required automating tools are lacking. We tackled
these problems in two steps. First, we conducted an exploratory study, collecting participants'
opinions on the game elements they consider the most useful for different learning activity types
(LAT) via survey. Then, we modeled opinions through conditional decision trees to address the aforementioned
tailoring process. Second, as a product from the first step, we implemented a recommender system
that suggests personalized gamification designs (which game elements to use), addressing the
problem of automating gamification personalization. Our findings i) present empirical evidence
that LAT, geographic locations, and other user characteristics affect users' preferences, ii)
enable defining gamification designs tailored to user and contextual features simultaneously,
and iii) provide technological aid for those interested in designing personalized gamification.
The main implications are that demographics, game-related characteristics, geographic location,
and LAT to be done, as well as the interaction between different kinds of information (user and contextual
characteristics), should be considered in defining gamification designs and that personalizing
gamification designs can be improved with aid from our recommender system.

With the unprecedented developments in deep learning, automatic segmentation of main abdominal
organs (i.e., liver, kidney, and spleen) seems to be a solved problem as the state-of-the-art (SOTA)
methods have achieved comparable results with inter-observer variability on existing benchmark
datasets. However, most of the existing abdominal organ segmentation benchmark datasets only
contain single-center, single-phase, single-vendor, or single-disease cases, thus, it is unclear
whether the excellent performance can generalize on more diverse datasets. In this paper, we present
a large and diverse abdominal CT organ segmentation dataset, termed as AbdomenCT-1K, with more
than 1000 (1K) CT scans from 11 countries, including multi-center, multi-phase, multi-vendor,
and multi-disease cases. Furthermore, we conduct a large-scale study for liver, kidney, spleen,
and pancreas segmentation, as well as reveal the unsolved segmentation problems of the SOTA method,
such as the limited generalization ability on distinct medical centers, phases, and unseen diseases.
To advance the unsolved problems, we build four organ segmentation benchmarks for fully supervised,
semi-supervised, weakly supervised, and continual learning, which are currently challenging
and active research topics. Accordingly, we develop a simple and effective method for each benchmark,
which can be used as out-of-the-box methods and strong baselines. We believe the introduction of
the AbdomenCT-1K dataset will promote future in-depth research towards clinical applicable abdominal
organ segmentation methods. Moreover, the datasets, codes, and trained models of baseline methods
will be publicly available at https://github.com/JunMa11/AbdomenCT-1K.

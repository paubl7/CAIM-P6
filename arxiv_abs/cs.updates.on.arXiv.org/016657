In this paper we present a benchmark dataset generated as part of a project for automatic identification
of misogyny within online content, which focuses in particular on memes. The benchmark here described
is composed of 800 memes collected from the most popular social media platforms, such as Facebook,
Twitter, Instagram and Reddit, and consulting websites dedicated to collection and creation of
memes. To gather misogynistic memes, specific keywords that refer to misogynistic content have
been considered as search criterion, considering different manifestations of hatred against
women, such as body shaming, stereotyping, objectification and violence. In parallel, memes with
no misogynist content have been manually downloaded from the same web sources. Among all the collected
memes, three domain experts have selected a dataset of 800 memes equally balanced between misogynistic
and non-misogynistic ones. This dataset has been validated through a crowdsourcing platform,
involving 60 subjects for the labelling process, in order to collect three evaluations for each
instance. Two further binary labels have been collected from both the experts and the crowdsourcing
platform, for memes evaluated as misogynistic, concerning aggressiveness and irony. Finally
for each meme, the text has been manually transcribed. The dataset provided is thus composed of the
800 memes, the labels given by the experts and those obtained by the crowdsourcing validation, and
the transcribed texts. This data can be used to approach the problem of automatic detection of misogynistic
content on the Web relying on both textual and visual cues, facing phenomenons that are growing every
day such as cybersexism and technology-facilitated violence.

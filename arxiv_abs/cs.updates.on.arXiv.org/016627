Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of adult death in the United States and worldwide,
and for which the coronary angiography procedure is the primary gateway for diagnosis and clinical
management decisions. The standard-of-care for interpretation of coronary angiograms depends
upon ad-hoc visual assessment by the physician operator. However, ad-hoc visual interpretation
of angiograms is poorly reproducible, highly variable and bias prone. Here we show for the first
time that fully-automated angiogram interpretation to estimate coronary artery stenosis is possible
using a sequence of deep neural network algorithms. The algorithmic pipeline we developed--called
CathAI--achieves state-of-the art performance across the sequence of tasks required to accomplish
automated interpretation of unselected, real-world angiograms. CathAI (Algorithms 1-2) demonstrated
positive predictive value, sensitivity and F1 score of >=90% to identify the projection angle overall
and >=93% for left or right coronary artery angiogram detection, the primary anatomic structures
of interest. To predict obstructive coronary artery stenosis (>=70% stenosis), CathAI (Algorithm
4) exhibited an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.862 (95% CI: 0.843-0.880).
When externally validated in a healthcare system in another country, CathAI AUC was 0.869 (95% CI:
0.830-0.907) to predict obstructive coronary artery stenosis. Our results demonstrate that multiple
purpose-built neural networks can function in sequence to accomplish the complex series of tasks
required for automated analysis of real-world angiograms. Deployment of CathAI may serve to increase
standardization and reproducibility in coronary stenosis assessment, while providing a robust
foundation to accomplish future tasks for algorithmic angiographic interpretation.

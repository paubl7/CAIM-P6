Research has shown that trust is an essential aspect of human-computer interaction directly determining
the degree to which the person is willing to use a system. An automatic prediction of the level of trust
that a user has on a certain system could be used to attempt to correct potential distrust by having
the system take relevant actions like, for example, apologizing or explaining its decisions. In
this work, we explore the feasibility of automatically detecting the level of trust that a user has
on a virtual assistant (VA) based on their speech. We developed a novel protocol for collecting speech
data from subjects induced to have different degrees of trust in the skills of a VA. The protocol consists
of an interactive session where the subject is asked to respond to a series of factual questions with
the help of a virtual assistant. In order to induce subjects to either trust or distrust the VA's skills,
they are first informed that the VA was previously rated by other users as being either good or bad;
subsequently, the VA answers the subjects' questions consistently to its alleged abilities. All
interactions are speech-based, with subjects and VAs communicating verbally, which allows the
recording of speech produced under different trust conditions. Using this protocol, we collected
a speech corpus in Argentine Spanish. We show clear evidence that the protocol effectively succeeded
in influencing subjects into the desired mental state of either trusting or distrusting the agent's
skills, and present results of a perceptual study of the degree of trust performed by expert listeners.
Finally, we found that the subject's speech can be used to detect which type of VA they were using,
which could be considered a proxy for the user's trust toward the VA's abilities, with an accuracy
up to 76%, compared to a random baseline of 50%.

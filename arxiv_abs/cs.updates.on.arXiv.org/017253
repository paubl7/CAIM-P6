Development of the intelligent autonomous robot technology presupposes its anticipated beneficial
effect on the individuals and societies. In the case of such disruptive emergent technology, not
only questions of how to build, but also why to build and with what consequences are important. The
field of ethics of intelligent autonomous robotic cars is a good example of research with actionable
practical value, where a variety of stakeholders, including the legal system and other societal
and governmental actors, as well as companies and businesses, collaborate bringing about shared
view of ethics and societal aspects of technology. It could be used as a starting platform for the
approaches to the development of intelligent autonomous robots in general, considering human-machine
interfaces in different phases of the life cycle of technology - the development, implementation,
testing, use and disposal. Drawing from our work on ethics of autonomous intelligent robocars,
and the existing literature on ethics of robotics, our contribution consists of a set of values and
ethical principles with identified challenges and proposed approaches for meeting them. This
may help stakeholders in the field of intelligent autonomous robotics to connect ethical principles
with their applications. Our recommendations of ethical requirements for autonomous cars can
be used for other types of intelligent autonomous robots, with the caveat for social robots that
require more research regarding interactions with the users. We emphasize that existing ethical
frameworks need to be applied in a context-sensitive way, by assessments in interdisciplinary,
multi-competent teams through multi-criteria analysis. Furthermore, we argue for the need of
a continuous development of ethical principles, guidelines, and regulations, informed by the
progress of technologies and involving relevant stakeholders.

Growth mindset interventions foster students' beliefs that their abilities can grow through effort
and appropriate strategies. However, not every student benefits from such interventions - yet
research identifying which student factors support growth mindset interventions is sparse. In
this study, we utilized machine learning methods to predict growth mindset effectiveness in a nationwide
experiment in the U.S. with over 10,000 students. These methods enable analysis of arbitrarily-complex
interactions between combinations of student-level predictor variables and intervention outcome,
defined as the improvement in grade point average (GPA) during the transition from high school.
We utilized two separate machine learning models: one to control for complex relationships between
51 student-level predictors and GPA, and one to predict the change in GPA due to the intervention.
We analyzed the trained models to discover which features influenced model predictions most, finding
that prior academic achievement, blocked navigations (attempting to navigate through the intervention
software too quickly), self-reported reasons for learning, and race/ethnicity were the most important
predictors in the model for predicting intervention effectiveness. As in previous research, we
found that the intervention was most effective for students with prior low academic achievement.
Unique to this study, we found that blocked navigations predicted an intervention effect as low
as 0.185 GPA points (on a 0-4 scale) less than the mean. This was a notable negative prediction given
that the mean intervention effect in our sample was just 0.026 GPA points, though few students (4.4%)
experienced a substantial number of blocked navigation events. We also found that some minoritized
students were predicted to benefit less (or even not at all) from the intervention.

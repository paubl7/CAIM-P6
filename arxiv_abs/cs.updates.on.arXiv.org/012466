Data privacy is a trending topic in the internet era. Given such importance, many challenges emerged
in order to collect, manage, process, and publish data. In this sense, personal data have got attention,
and many regulations emerged, such as GDPR in the European Union and LGPD in Brazil. This regulation
model aims to protect users' data from misusage and leakage and allow users to request an explanation
from companies when needed. In pandemic situations, such as the COVID-19 and Ebola outbreak, the
action related to sharing health data between different organizations is/ was crucial to develop
a significant movement to avoid the massive infection and decrease the number of deaths. However,
the data subject, i.e., the users, should have the right to request the purpose of data use, anonymization,
and data deletion. In this sense, permissioned blockchain technology emerges to empower users
to get their rights providing data ownership, transparency, and security through an immutable,
unified, and distributed database ruled by smart contracts. The governance model discussed in
blockchain applications is usually regarding the first layer governance, i.e., public and permissioned
models. However, this discussion is too superficial, and they do not cover compliance with the data
regulations. Therefore, in order to organize the relationship between data owners and the stakeholders,
i.e., companies and governmental entities, we developed a second layer data governance model for
permissioned blockchains based on the Governance Analytical Framework principles applied in
pandemic situations preserving the users' privacy and their duties. From the law perspective,
we based our model on the UE GDPR in regard to data privacy concerns.

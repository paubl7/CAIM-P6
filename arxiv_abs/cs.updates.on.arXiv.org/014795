Background: Blog posts are frequently used by software practitioners to share information about
their practice. Blog posts therefore provide a potential source of evidence for software engineering
(SE) research. The use of blog posts as evidence for research appears contentious amongst some SE
researchers. Objective: To better understand the actual and perceived value of blog posts as evidence
for SE research, and to develop guidance for SE researchers on the use of blog posts as evidence. Method:
We further analyse responses from a previously conducted attitudinal survey of 44 software engineering
researchers. We conduct a heatmap analysis, simple statistical analysis, and a thematic analysis.
Results: We find no clear consensus from respondents on researchers' attitudes to the credibility
of blog posts, or on a standard set of criteria to evaluate blog-post credibility. We show that some
of the responses to the survey exhibit characteristics similar to the content of blog posts, e.g.,
asserting prior beliefs as claims, with no citations and little supporting rationale. We illustrate
our insights with ~60 qualitative examples from the survey ~40% of the total responses. We complement
our quantitative and qualitative analyses with preliminary checklists to guide SE researchers.
Conclusion: Blog posts are relevant to research because they are written by software practitioners
describing their practice and experience. But evaluating the credibility of blog posts, so as to
select the higher-quality content, remains an ongoing challenge. The quantitative and qualitative
results, with the proposed checklists, are intended to stimulate reflection and action in the research
community on the role of blog posts as evidence in software engineering research. Finally, our findings
on researchers' attitudes to blog posts also provide more general insights into researchers' values
for SE research.

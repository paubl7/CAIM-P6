Linking clinical narratives to standardized vocabularies and coding systems is a key component
of unlocking the information in medical text for analysis. However, many domains of medical concepts
lack well-developed terminologies that can support effective coding of medical text. We present
a framework for developing natural language processing (NLP) technologies for automated coding
of under-studied types of medical information, and demonstrate its applicability via a case study
on physical mobility function. Mobility is a component of many health measures, from post-acute
care and surgical outcomes to chronic frailty and disability, and is coded in the International
Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF). However, mobility and other types
of functional activity remain under-studied in medical informatics, and neither the ICF nor commonly-used
medical terminologies capture functional status terminology in practice. We investigated two
data-driven paradigms, classification and candidate selection, to link narrative observations
of mobility to standardized ICF codes, using a dataset of clinical narratives from physical therapy
encounters. Recent advances in language modeling and word embedding were used as features for established
machine learning models and a novel deep learning approach, achieving a macro F-1 score of 84% on
linking mobility activity reports to ICF codes. Both classification and candidate selection approaches
present distinct strengths for automated coding in under-studied domains, and we highlight that
the combination of (i) a small annotated data set; (ii) expert definitions of codes of interest;
and (iii) a representative text corpus is sufficient to produce high-performing automated coding
systems. This study has implications for the ongoing growth of NLP tools for a variety of specialized
applications in clinical care and research.

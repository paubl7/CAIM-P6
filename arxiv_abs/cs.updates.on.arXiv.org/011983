For graphs $G,H$, a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ is an edge-preserving mapping from $V(G)$ to $V(H)$.
In the list homomorphism problem, denoted by \textsc{LHom}($H$), we are given a graph $G$ and lists
$L: V(G) \to 2^{V(H)}$, and we ask for a homomorphism from $G$ to $H$ which additionally respects
the lists $L$. Very recently Okrasa, Piecyk, and Rz\k{a}\.zewski [ESA 2020] defined an invariant
$i^*(H)$ and proved that under the SETH $\mathcal{O}^*\left (i^*(H)^{\textrm{tw}(G)}\right)$
is the tight complexity bound for \textsc{LHom}($H$), parameterized by the treewidth $\textrm{tw}(G)$
of the instance graph $G$. We study the complexity of the problem under dirretent parameterizations.
As the first result, we show that $i^*(H)$ is also the right complexity base if the parameter is the
size of a minimum feedback vertex set of $G$. Then we turn our attention to a parameterization by the
cutwidth $\textrm{ctw}(G)$ of $G$. Jansen and Nederlof~[ESA 2018] showed that \textsc{List $k$-Coloring}
(i.e., \textsc{LHom}($K_k$)) can be solved in time $\mathcal{O}^*\left (c^{\textrm{ctw}(G)}\right)$
where $c$ does not depend on $k$. Jansen asked if this behavior extends to graph homomorphisms. As
the main result of the paper, we answer the question in the negative. We define a new graph invariant
$mim^*(H)$ and prove that \textsc{LHom}($H$) problem cannot be solved in time $\mathcal{O}^*\left
((mim^*(H)-\varepsilon)^{\textrm{ctw}(G)}\right)$ for any $\varepsilon >0$, unless the SETH
fails. This implies that there is no $c$, such that for every odd cycle the non-list version of the
problem can be solved in time $\mathcal{O}^*\left (c^{\textrm{ctw}(G)} \right)$. Finally, we
generalize the algorithm of Jansen and Nederlof, so that it can be used to solve \textsc{LHom}($H$)
for every graph $H$; its complexity depends on $\textrm{ctw}(G)$ and another invariant of $H$,
which is constant for cliques.

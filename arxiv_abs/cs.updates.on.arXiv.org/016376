The latest advances in computer-assisted precision medicine are making it feasible to move from
population-wide models that are useful to discover aggregate patterns that hold for group-based
analysis to patient-specific models that can drive patient-specific decisions with regard to
treatment choices, and predictions of outcomes of treatment. Body Composition is recognized as
an important driver and risk factor for a wide variety of diseases, as well as a predictor of individual
patient-specific clinical outcomes to treatment choices or surgical interventions. 3D CT images
are routinely acquired in the oncological worklows and deliver accurate rendering of internal
anatomy and therefore can be used opportunistically to assess the amount of skeletal muscle and
adipose tissue compartments. Powerful tools of artificial intelligence such as deep learning
are making it feasible now to segment the entire 3D image and generate accurate measurements of all
internal anatomy. These will enable the overcoming of the severe bottleneck that existed previously,
namely, the need for manual segmentation, which was prohibitive to scale to the hundreds of 2D axial
slices that made up a 3D volumetric image. Automated tools such as presented here will now enable
harvesting whole-body measurements from 3D CT or MRI images, leading to a new era of discovery of
the drivers of various diseases based on individual tissue, organ volume, shape, and functional
status. These measurements were hitherto unavailable thereby limiting the field to a very small
and limited subset. These discoveries and the potential to perform individual image segmentation
with high speed and accuracy are likely to lead to the incorporation of these 3D measures into individual
specific treatment planning models related to nutrition, aging, chemotoxicity, surgery and survival
after the onset of a major disease such as cancer.

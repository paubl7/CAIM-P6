Anomaly detection has attracted considerable search attention. However, existing anomaly detection
databases encounter two major problems. Firstly, they are limited in scale. Secondly, training
sets contain only video-level labels indicating the existence of an abnormal event during the full
video while lacking annotations of precise time durations. To tackle these problems, we contribute
a new Large-scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database as the benchmark for anomaly detection in video
sequences, which is featured in two aspects. 1) It contains 2000 video sequences including normal
and abnormal video clips with 14 anomaly categories including crash, fire, violence, etc. with
large scene varieties, making it the largest anomaly analysis database to date. 2) It provides the
annotation data, including video-level labels (abnormal/normal video, anomaly type) and frame-level
labels (abnormal/normal video frame) to facilitate anomaly detection. Leveraging the above benefits
from the LAD database, we further formulate anomaly detection as a fully-supervised learning problem
and propose a multi-task deep neural network to solve it. We first obtain the local spatiotemporal
contextual feature by using an Inflated 3D convolutional (I3D) network. Then we construct a recurrent
convolutional neural network fed the local spatiotemporal contextual feature to extract the spatiotemporal
contextual feature. With the global spatiotemporal contextual feature, the anomaly type and score
can be computed simultaneously by a multi-task neural network. Experimental results show that
the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art anomaly detection methods on our database
and other public databases of anomaly detection. Codes are available at https://github.com/wanboyang/anomaly_detection_LAD2000.

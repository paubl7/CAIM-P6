We investigate molecular mechanisms of resistant or sensitive response of cancer drug combination
therapies in an inductive and interpretable manner. Though deep learning algorithms are widely
used in the drug synergy prediction problem, it is still an open problem to formulate the prediction
model with biological meaning to investigate the mysterious mechanisms of synergy (MoS) for the
human-AI collaboration in healthcare systems. To address the challenges, we propose a deep graph
neural network, IDSP (Interpretable Deep Signaling Pathways), to incorporate the gene-gene as
well as gene-drug regulatory relationships in synergic drug combination predictions. IDSP automatically
learns weights of edges based on the gene and drug node relations, i.e., signaling interactions,
by a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and aggregates information in an inductive manner. The proposed
architecture generates interpretable drug synergy prediction by detecting important signaling
interactions, and can be implemented when the underlying molecular mechanism encounters unseen
genes or signaling pathways. We test IDWSP on signaling networks formulated by genes from 46 core
cancer signaling pathways and drug combinations from NCI ALMANAC drug combination screening data.
The experimental results demonstrated that 1) IDSP can learn from the underlying molecular mechanism
to make prediction without additional drug chemical information while achieving highly comparable
performance with current state-of-art methods; 2) IDSP show superior generality and flexibility
to implement the synergy prediction task on both transductive tasks and inductive tasks. 3) IDSP
can generate interpretable results by detecting different salient signaling patterns (i.e. MoS)
for different cell lines.

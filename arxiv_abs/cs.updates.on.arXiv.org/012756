The Orienteering Problem with Time Windows (OPTW) is a combinatorial optimization problem where
the goal is to maximize the total scores collected from visited locations, under some time constraints.
Several heuristics have been proposed for the OPTW, yet in comparison with machine learning models,
a heuristic typically has a smaller potential for generalization and personalization. The application
of neural network models to combinatorial optimization has recently shown promising results in
similar problems like the Travelling Salesman Problem. A neural network allows learning solutions
using reinforcement learning or in a supervised way, depending on the available data. After learning,
it can potentially generalize and be quickly fine-tuned to further improve performance and personalization.
This is advantageous since, for real word applications, a solution's quality, personalization
and execution times are all important factors to be taken into account. Here we explore the use of
Pointer Network models trained with reinforcement learning for solving the OPTW problem. Among
its various applications, the OPTW can be used to model the Tourist Trip Design Problem (TTDP). We
train the Pointer Network with the TTDP problem in mind, by sampling variables that can change across
tourists for a particular instance-region: starting position, starting time, time available
and the scores of each point of interest. After a model-region is trained it can infer a solution for
a particular tourist using beam search. We evaluate our approach on several existing benchmark
OPTW instances. We show that it is able to generalize across different generated tourists for each
region and that it generally outperforms the most commonly used heuristic while computing the solution
in realistic times.

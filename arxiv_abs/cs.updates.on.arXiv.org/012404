Recent works on visible light communication (VLC) based vehicle localization methods using VLC
signals from head/tail LED lights for positioning report cm-level accuracy and near-kHz rates,
which can enable collision avoidance and platooning for safer autonomous driving. However, existing
analyses of these methods are not comparable and are inconclusive since they assume different system
models and consider limited simulations. In this paper, we analyze the theoretical performances
of four state-of-the-art (SoA) methods which measure physical VLC system parameters (e.g., propagation
distance) using phase-difference-of-arrival (PDoA), roundtrip-time-of-flight (RToF), and
single/dual receiver angle-of-arrival (AoA1/AoA2) characteristics of received signals respectively,
and estimate position based on these parameters and geometric relations (e.g., triangulation).
Specifically, we derive the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) on positioning accuracy for each method
with respect to measured parameters, simulate their parameter measurement procedures under realistic
driving scenarios, and evaluate their CRLBs using these simulated measurements. Results show
that the current SoA PDoA based method fails to provide cm-level accuracy under any realistic scenario
considering the <1 MHz bandwidth of current head/tail LED lights. The AoA1 method provides cm-level
accuracy for close range platooning, but its high-sensitivity geometry causes accuracy degradation
at high distances. RToF and AoA2 methods provide cm-level accuracy under low to moderate VLC channel
noise for all scenarios within 10 m distance, theoretically proving the feasibility of VLC based
vehicle localization for collision avoidance and platooning.

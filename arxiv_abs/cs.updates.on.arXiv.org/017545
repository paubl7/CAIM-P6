This paper aims at providing the summary of the Global Data Science Project (GDSC) for COVID-19.
as on May 31 2020. COVID-19 has largely impacted on our societies through both direct and indirect
effects transmitted by the policy measures to counter the spread of viruses. We quantitatively
analysed the multifaceted impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on our societies including people's
mobility, health, and social behaviour changes. People's mobility has changed significantly
due to the implementation of travel restriction and quarantine measurements. Indeed, the physical
distance has widened at international (cross-border), national and regional level. At international
level, due to the travel restrictions, the number of international flights has plunged overall
at around 88 percent during March. In particular, the number of flights connecting Europe dropped
drastically in mid of March after the United States announced travel restrictions to Europe and
the EU and participating countries agreed to close borders, at 84 percent decline compared to March
10th. Similarly, we examined the impacts of quarantine measures in the major city: Tokyo (Japan),
New York City (the United States), and Barcelona (Spain). Within all three cities, we found the significant
decline in traffic volume. We also identified the increased concern for mental health through the
analysis of posts on social networking services such as Twitter and Instagram. Notably, in the beginning
of April 2020, the number of post with #depression on Instagram doubled, which might reflect the
rise in mental health awareness among Instagram users. Besides, we identified the changes in a wide
range of people's social behaviors, as well as economic impacts through the analysis of Instagram
data and primary survey data.

Handwritten character recognition is a challenging research in the field of document image analysis
over many decades due to numerous reasons such as large writing styles variation, inherent noise
in data, expansive applications it offers, non-availability of benchmark databases etc. There
has been considerable work reported in literature about creation of the database for several Indic
scripts but the Tamil script is still in its infancy as it has been reported only in one database [5].
In this paper, we present the work done in the creation of an exhaustive and large unconstrained Tamil
Handwritten Character Database (uTHCD). Database consists of around 91000 samples with nearly
600 samples in each of 156 classes. The database is a unified collection of both online and offline
samples. Offline samples were collected by asking volunteers to write samples on a form inside a
specified grid. For online samples, we made the volunteers write in a similar grid using a digital
writing pad. The samples collected encompass a vast variety of writing styles, inherent distortions
arising from offline scanning process viz stroke discontinuity, variable thickness of stroke,
distortion etc. Algorithms which are resilient to such data can be practically deployed for real
time applications. The samples were generated from around 650 native Tamil volunteers including
school going kids, homemakers, university students and faculty. The isolated character database
will be made publicly available as raw images and Hierarchical Data File (HDF) compressed file.
With this database, we expect to set a new benchmark in Tamil handwritten character recognition
and serve as a launchpad for many avenues in document image analysis domain. Paper also presents
an ideal experimental set-up using the database on convolutional neural networks (CNN) with a baseline
accuracy of 88% on test data.

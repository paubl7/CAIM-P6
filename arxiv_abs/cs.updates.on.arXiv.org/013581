Topic Detection and Tracking (TDT) is a very active research question within the area of text mining,
generally applied to news feeds and Twitter datasets, where topics and events are detected. The
notion of "event" is broad, but typically it applies to occurrences that can be detected from a single
post or a message. Little attention has been drawn to what we call "micro-events", which, due to their
nature, cannot be detected from a single piece of textual information. The study investigates the
feasibility of micro-event detection on textual data using a sample of messages from the Stack Overflow
Q&A platform and Free/Libre Open Source Software (FLOSS) version releases from Libraries.io dataset.
We build pipelines for detection of micro-events using three different estimators whose parameters
are optimized using a grid search approach. We consider two feature spaces: LDA topic modeling with
sentiment analysis, and hSBM topics with sentiment analysis. The feature spaces are optimized
using the recursive feature elimination with cross validation (RFECV) strategy. In our experiments
we investigate whether there is a characteristic change in the topics distribution or sentiment
features before or after micro-events take place and we thoroughly evaluate the capacity of each
variant of our analysis pipeline to detect micro-events. Additionally, we perform a detailed statistical
analysis of the models, including influential cases, variance inflation factors, validation
of the linearity assumption, pseudo R squared measures and no-information rate. Finally, in order
to study limits of micro-event detection, we design a method for generating micro-event synthetic
datasets with similar properties to the real-world data, and use them to identify the micro-event
detectability threshold for each of the evaluated classifiers.

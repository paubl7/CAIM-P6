Novel Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an extremely contagious and quickly spreading Coronavirus
infestation. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS),
which outbreak in 2002 and 2011, and the current COVID-19 pandemic are all from the same family of
coronavirus. This work aims to classify COVID-19, SARS, and MERS chest X-ray (CXR) images using
deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). A unique database was created, so-called QU-COVID-family,
consisting of 423 COVID-19, 144 MERS, and 134 SARS CXR images. Besides, a robust COVID-19 recognition
system was proposed to identify lung regions using a CNN segmentation model (U-Net), and then classify
the segmented lung images as COVID-19, MERS, or SARS using a pre-trained CNN classifier. Furthermore,
the Score-CAM visualization method was utilized to visualize classification output and understand
the reasoning behind the decision of deep CNNs. Several Deep Learning classifiers were trained
and tested; four outperforming algorithms were reported. Original and preprocessed images were
used individually and all together as the input(s) to the networks. Two recognition schemes were
considered: plain CXR classification and segmented CXR classification. For plain CXRs, it was
observed that InceptionV3 outperforms other networks with a 3-channel scheme and achieves sensitivities
of 99.5%, 93.1%, and 97% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. In contrast,
for segmented CXRs, InceptionV3 outperformed using the original CXR dataset and achieved sensitivities
of 96.94%, 79.68%, and 90.26% for classifying COVID-19, MERS, and SARS images, respectively. All
networks showed high COVID-19 detection sensitivity (>96%) with the segmented lung images. This
indicates the unique radiographic signature of COVID-19 cases in the eyes of AI, which is often a
challenging task for medical doctors.

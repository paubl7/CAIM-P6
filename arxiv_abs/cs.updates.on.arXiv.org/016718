A moplex is a natural graph structure that arises when lifting Dirac's classical theorem from chordal
graphs to general graphs. However, while every non-complete graph has at least two moplexes, little
is known about structural properties of graphs with a bounded number of moplexes. The study of these
graphs is motivated by the parallel between moplexes in general graphs and simplicial modules in
chordal graphs: Unlike in the moplex setting, properties of chordal graphs with a bounded number
of simplicial modules are well understood. For instance, chordal graphs having at most two simplicial
modules are interval. In this work we initiate an investigation of $k$-moplex graphs, which are
defined as graphs containing at most $k$ moplexes. Of particular interest is the smallest nontrivial
case $k=2$, which forms a counterpart to the class of interval graphs. As our main structural result,
we show that the class of connected $2$-moplex graphs is sandwiched between the classes of proper
interval graphs and cocomparability graphs; moreover, both inclusions are tight for hereditary
classes. From a complexity theoretic viewpoint, this leads to the natural question of whether the
presence of at most two moplexes guarantees a sufficient amount of structure to efficiently solve
problems that are known to be intractable on cocomparability graphs, but not on proper interval
graphs. We develop new reductions that answer this question negatively for two prominent problems
fitting this profile, namely Graph Isomorphism and Max-Cut. On the other hand, we prove that every
connected $2$-moplex graph contains a Hamiltonian path, generalising the same property of connected
proper interval graphs. Furthermore, for graphs with a higher number of moplexes, we lift the previously
known result that graphs without asteroidal triples have at most two moplexes to the more general
setting of larger asteroidal sets.

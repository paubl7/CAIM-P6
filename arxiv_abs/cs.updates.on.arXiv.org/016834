Kalman filter is presumably one of the most important and extensively used filtering techniques
in modern control systems. Yet, nearly all current variants of Kalman filters are formulated in
the Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$, while many real-world systems (e.g., robotic systems) are
really evolving on manifolds. In this paper, we propose a method to develop Kalman filters for such
on-manifold systems. Utilizing $\boxplus$, $\boxminus$ operations and further defining an oplus
operation on the respective manifold, we propose a canonical representation of the on-manifold
system. Such a canonical form enables us to separate the manifold constraints from the system behaviors
in each step of the Kalman filter, ultimately leading to a generic and symbolic Kalman filter framework
that are naturally evolving on the manifold. Furthermore, the on-manifold Kalman filter is implemented
as a toolkit in $C$++ packages which enables users to implement an on-manifold Kalman filter just
like the normal one in $\mathbb{R}^n$: the user needs only to provide the system-specific descriptions,
and then call the respective filter steps (e.g., predict, update) without dealing with any of the
manifold constraints. The existing implementation supports full iterated Kalman filtering for
systems on any manifold composed of $\mathbb{R}^n$, $SO(3)$ and $\mathbb{S}^2$, and is extendable
to other types of manifold when necessary. The proposed symbolic Kalman filter and the developed
toolkit are verified by implementing a tightly-coupled lidar-inertial navigation system. Results
show that the developed toolkit leads to superior filtering performances and computation efficiency
comparable to hand-engineered counterparts. Finally, the toolkit is opened sourced at https://github.com/hku-mars/IKFoM
to assist practitioners to quickly deploy an on-manifold Kalman filter.

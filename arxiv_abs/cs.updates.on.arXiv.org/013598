Pneumothorax, a life threatening disease, needs to be diagnosed immediately and efficiently.
The prognosis in this case is not only time consuming but also prone to human errors. So an automatic
way of accurate diagnosis using chest X-rays is the utmost requirement. To-date, most of the available
medical images datasets have class-imbalance issue. The main theme of this study is to solve this
problem along with proposing an automated way of detecting pneumothorax. We first compare the existing
approaches to tackle the class-imbalance issue and find that data-level-ensemble (i.e. ensemble
of subsets of dataset) outperforms other approaches. Thus, we propose a novel framework named as
VDV model, which is a complex model-level-ensemble of data-level-ensembles and uses three convolutional
neural networks (CNN) including VGG16, VGG-19 and DenseNet-121 as fixed feature extractors. In
each data-level-ensemble features extracted from one of the pre-defined CNN are fed to support
vector machine (SVM) classifier, and output from each data-level-ensemble is calculated using
voting method. Once outputs from the three data-level-ensembles with three different CNN architectures
are obtained, then, again, voting method is used to calculate the final prediction. Our proposed
framework is tested on SIIM ACR Pneumothorax dataset and Random Sample of NIH Chest X-ray dataset
(RS-NIH). For the first dataset, 85.17% Recall with 86.0% Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic
curve (AUC) is attained. For the second dataset, 90.9% Recall with 95.0% AUC is achieved with random
split of data while 85.45% recall with 77.06% AUC is obtained with patient-wise split of data. For
RS-NIH, the obtained results are higher as compared to previous results from literature However,
for first dataset, direct comparison cannot be made, since this dataset has not been used earlier
for Pneumothorax classification.

Millions of RFID tags are pervasively used all around the globe to inexpensively identify a wide
variety of everyday-use objects. One of the key issues of RFID is that tags cannot use energy-hungry
cryptography. For this reason, radio fingerprinting (RFP) is a compelling approach that leverages
the unique imperfections in the tag's wireless circuitry to achieve large-scale RFID clone detection.
Recent work, however, has unveiled that time-varying channel conditions can significantly decrease
the accuracy of the RFP process. We propose the first large-scale investigation into RFP of RFID
tags with dynamic channel conditions. Specifically, we perform a massive data collection campaign
on a testbed composed by 200 off-the-shelf identical RFID tags and a software-defined radio (SDR)
tag reader. We collect data with different tag-reader distances in an over-the-air configuration.
To emulate implanted RFID tags, we also collect data with two different kinds of porcine meat inserted
between the tag and the reader. We use this rich dataset to train and test several convolutional neural
network (CNN)--based classifiers in a variety of channel conditions. Our investigation reveals
that training and testing on different channel conditions drastically degrades the classifier's
accuracy. For this reason, we propose a novel training framework based on federated machine learning
(FML) and data augmentation (DAG) to boost the accuracy. Extensive experimental results indicate
that (i) our FML approach improves accuracy by up to 48%; (ii) our DA approach improves the FML performance
by up to 31%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first paper experimentally demonstrating the
efficacy of FML and DA on a large device population. We are sharing with the research community our
fully-labeled 200-GB RFID waveform dataset, the entirety of our code and trained models.

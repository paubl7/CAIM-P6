Approach and landing accidents (ALAs) have resulted in a significant number of hull losses worldwide,
aside from runway excursion, hard landing, landing short. Technologies (e.g., instrument landing
system) and procedures (e.g., stabilized approach criteria) have been developed to reduce ALA
risks. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to learn and interpret flight's 4D approach
and landing parameters to facilitate comprehensible and actionable insights of landing dynamics
for aircrew and air traffic controller (ATCO) in real-time. Specifically, we develop a tunnel Gaussian
process (TGP) model to gain an insight into the landing dynamics of aircraft using advanced surface
movement guidance and control system (A-SMGCS) data, which then indicates the stability of flight.
TGP hybridizes the strengths of sparse variational Gaussian process and polar Gaussian process
to learn from a large amount of data in cylindrical coordinates. We examine TGP qualitatively and
quantitatively by synthesizing two complex trajectory datasets. Empirically, TGP reconstructed
the structure of the synthesized trajectories. When applied to operational A-SMGCS data, TGP provides
the probabilistic description of landing dynamics and interpretable 4D tunnel views of approach
and landing parameters. The 4D tunnel views can facilitate the analysis of procedure adherence
and augment existing aircrew and ATCO's display during the approach and landing procedures, enabling
necessary corrective actions. The proposed TGP model can also provide insights and aid the design
of landing procedures in complex runway configurations such as parallel approach. Moreover, the
extension of TGP model to the next generation of landing systems (e.g., GNSS landing system) is straight-forward.

In CS literature, the efforts can be divided into two groups: finding a measurement matrix that preserves
the compressed information at the maximum level, and finding a reconstruction algorithm for the
compressed information. In the traditional CS setup, the measurement matrices are selected as
random matrices, and optimization-based iterative solutions are used to recover the signals.
However, when we handle large signals, using random matrices become cumbersome especially when
it comes to iterative optimization-based solutions. Even though recent deep learning-based solutions
boost the reconstruction accuracy performance while speeding up the recovery, still jointly learning
the whole measurement matrix is a difficult process. In this work, we introduce a separable multi-linear
learning of the CS matrix by representing it as the summation of arbitrary number of tensors. For
a special case where the CS operation is set as a single tensor multiplication, the model is reduced
to the learning-based separable CS; while a dense CS matrix can be approximated and learned as the
summation of multiple tensors. Both cases can be used in CS of two or multi-dimensional signals e.g.,
images, multi-spectral images, videos, etc. Structural CS matrices can also be easily approximated
and learned in our multi-linear separable learning setup with structural tensor sum representation.
Hence, our learnable generalized tensor summation CS operation encapsulates most CS setups including
separable CS, non-separable CS (traditional vector-matrix multiplication), structural CS,
and CS of the multi-dimensional signals. For both gray-scale and RGB images, the proposed scheme
surpasses most state-of-the-art solutions, especially in lower measurement rates. Although
the performance gain remains limited from tensor to the sum of tensor representation for gray-scale
images, it becomes significant in the RGB case.

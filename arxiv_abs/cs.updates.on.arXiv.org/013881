We introduce a fast and robust algorithm for finding a plane $\Gamma$ with given normal $\vec{n}_\Gamma$,
which truncates an arbitrary polyhedron $\mathcal{P}$ such that the remaining sub-polyhedron
admits a given volume $\alpha|\mathcal{P}|$. In the literature, this is commonly referred to as
Volume-of-Fluid (VoF) interface positioning problem. The novelty of our work is twofold: firstly,
by recursive application of the Gaussian divergence theorem, the volume of a truncated polyhedron
can be computed at high efficiency, based on summation over quantities associated to the faces of
the polyhedron. One obtains a very convenient piecewise parametrization (within so-called brackets)
in terms of the signed distance s to the plane $\Gamma$. As an implication, one can restrain from the
costly necessity to establish topological connectivity, rendering the present approach most
suitable for the application to unstructured computational meshes. Secondly, in the vicinity
of the truncation position s, the volume can be expressed exactly, i.e. in terms of a cubic polynomial
of the normal distance to the PLIC plane. The local knowledge of derivatives enables to construct
a root-finding algorithm that pairs bracketing and higher-order approximation. The performance
is assessed by conducting an extensive set of numerical experiments, considering convex and non-convex
polyhedra of genus (i.e., number of holes) zero and one in combination with carefully selected volume
fractions $\alpha$ (including $\alpha\approx0$ and $\alpha\approx1$) and normal orientations
$\vec{n}_\Gamma$. For all configurations we obtain a significant reduction of the number of (computationally
costly) truncations required for the positioning: on average, our algorithm requires between
one and two polyhedron truncations to find the position of the plane $\Gamma$, outperforming existing
methods.

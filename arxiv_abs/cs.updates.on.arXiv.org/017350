The 3D reconstruction of objects is a prerequisite for many highly relevant applications of computer
vision such as mobile robotics or autonomous driving. To deal with the inverse problem of reconstructing
3D objects from their 2D projections, a common strategy is to incorporate prior object knowledge
into the reconstruction approach by establishing a 3D model and aligning it to the 2D image plane.
However, current approaches are limited due to inadequate shape priors and the insufficiency of
the derived image observations for a reliable alignment with the 3D model. The goal of this paper
is to show how 3D object reconstruction can profit from a more sophisticated shape prior and from
a combined incorporation of different observation types inferred from the images. We introduce
a subcategory-aware deformable vehicle model that makes use of a prediction of the vehicle type
for a more appropriate regularisation of the vehicle shape. A multi-branch CNN is presented to derive
predictions of the vehicle type and orientation. This information is also introduced as prior information
for model fitting. Furthermore, the CNN extracts vehicle keypoints and wireframes, which are well-suited
for model-to-image association and model fitting. The task of pose estimation and reconstruction
is addressed by a versatile probabilistic model. Extensive experiments are conducted using two
challenging real-world data sets on both of which the benefit of the developed shape prior can be
shown. A comparison to state-of-the-art methods for vehicle pose estimation shows that the proposed
approach performs on par or better, confirming the suitability of the developed shape prior and
probabilistic model for vehicle reconstruction.

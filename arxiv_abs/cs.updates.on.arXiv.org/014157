Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is a robust multiple access scheme for downlink multi-antenna
wireless networks. RSMA relies on multi-antenna Rate-Splitting (RS) strategies at the transmitter
and Successive Interference Cancellation (SIC) at the receivers. RSMA manages interference by
partially decoding interference and partially treating interference as noise. RSMA has been shown
to achieve significant gain in terms of spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, Quality-of-Service
enhancements, robustness to Channel State Information (CSI) imperfections due to imperfect channel
estimation and mobility, as well as feedback overhead and complexity reduction, in a wide range
of network loads (underloaded and overloaded regimes) and user deployments (with a diversity of
channel directions, channel strengths and qualities). In this work, we investigate a novel application
of RSMA for joint communications and jamming with a Multi-Carrier (MC) waveform in Multiple Input
Single Output (MISO) Broadcast Channel (BC). Our aim is to simultaneously communicate with Information
Users (IU) and jam Adversarial Users (AU) to disrupt their communications in a setting where all
users perform broadband communications by MC waveforms in their respective networks. We consider
the practical setting of imperfect CSI at transmitter (CSIT) for the IUs and statistical CSIT for
AUs. The optimal information and jamming precoders are designed to maximize the Sum-Rate (SR) under
jamming energy constraints on the pilot subcarriers of AUs, a jamming method considered to be among
the most destructive methods for MC waveforms under the considered system model. We compare the
SR performance of RSMA and Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA) schemes by numerical results to
demonstrate that RSMA achieves a significant SR gain compared to SDMA.

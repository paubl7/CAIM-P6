Publishing original scientific research is inherent to the work of a researcher. However, the pressure
to maintain productivity and scientific impact can lead to research group publishing excessively,
negatively affecting the mental health of a researcher. Ph.D. students and early career researchers
are particularly susceptible to this pressure due to the inherent vulnerability of their positions.
At present, there are no resources that concisely summarise the publication culture of a research
group to help the researcher make an informed decision before joining. In this article, we present
the 'Super Researcher' app, an R Shiny application(app) with a user-friendly interface. Using
text-mining methodology to extract publicly available author data from Scopus, this pilot app
has four fundamental functions to provide snapshot information that will help researchers grasp
the publication culture of a research group within minutes. The 'Super Researcher' app provides
information on: 1) institution data, 2) author's publication, 3) co-author network plots and 4)
publication journals. The 'Super Researcher' app is built on R shiny which provides an interactive
interface to users. This app utilizes the Big Data framework Apache Spark to mine relevant information
from a huge author information database. The author's information is stored and manipulated using
both SQL(SQLite) and NoSQL(HBase) databases. Hbase is used for local data storage and manipulation
while SQLite feeds data to the R Shiny interface. In this paper, we introduce these functionalities
and illustrate how this information can help guide a researcher to select a new Principle Investigator
(PI) with better compatibility in terms of publication attitude using a case study. Available:

Many applications in important problem domains such as machine learning and computer vision are
streaming applications that take a sequence of inputs over time. It is challenging to find knob settings
that optimize the run-time performance of such applications because the optimal knob settings
are usually functions of inputs, computing platforms, time as well as user's requirements, which
can be very diverse. Most prior works address this problem by offline profiling followed by training
models for control. However, profiling-based approaches incur large overhead before execution;
it is also difficult to redeploy them in other run-time configurations. In this paper, we propose
Sonic, a sampling-based online controller for long-running streaming applications that does
not require profiling ahead of time. Within each phase of a streaming application's execution,
Sonic utilizes the beginning portion to sample the knob space strategically and aims to pick the
optimal knob setting for the rest of the phase, given a user-specified constrained optimization
problem. A hybrid approach of machine learning regressions and Bayesian optimization are used
for better overall sampling choices. Sonic is implemented independent of application, device,
input, performance objective and constraints. We evaluate Sonic on traditional parallel benchmarks
as well as on deep learning inference benchmarks across multiple platforms. Our experiments show
that when using Sonic to control knob settings, application run-time performance is only 5.3% less
than if optimal knob settings were used, demonstrating that Sonic is able to find near-optimal knob
settings under diverse run-time configurations without prior knowledge quickly.

The rapidly expanding nature of the Internet of Things (IoT) networks is beginning to attract interest
across a range of applications, including smart homes, smart transportation, smart health, and
industrial contexts. This cutting-edge technology enables individuals to track and control their
integrated environment in real-time and remotely via a thousand IoT devices comprised of sensors
and actuators that actively participate in sensing, processing, storing, and sharing information.
Nonetheless, IoT devices are frequently deployed in hostile environments, wherein adversaries
attempt to capture and breach them in order to seize control of the entire network. One such example
of potentially malicious behaviour is the cloning of IoT devices, in which an attacker can physically
capture the devices, obtain some sensitive information, duplicate the devices, and intelligently
deploy them in desired locations to conduct various insider attacks. A device cloning attack on
IoT networks is a significant security concern since it allows for selective forwarding, sink-hole,
and black-hole attacks. To address this issue, this paper provides an efficient scheme for detecting
clone node attacks on IoT networks that makes use of semantic information about IoT devices known
as context information sensed from the deployed environment to locate them securely. We design
a location proof mechanism by combining location proofs and batch verification of the extended
elliptic curve digital signature technique to accelerate the verification process at selected
trusted nodes. We demonstrate the security of our scheme and its resilience to secure clone node
attack detection by conducting a comprehensive security analysis. The performance of our proposed
scheme provides a high degree of detection accuracy with minimal detection time and significantly
reduces the computation, communication and storage overhead.

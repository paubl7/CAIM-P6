Context: Software security patch management purports to support the process of patching known
software security vulnerabilities. Patching security vulnerabilities in large and complex systems
is a hugely challenging process that involves multiple stakeholders making several interdependent
technological and socio-technical decisions. Objective: This paper reports our work aimed at
systematically reviewing the state of the art of software security patch management to identify
the socio-technical challenges in this regard, reported solutions (i.e., approaches and associated
tools, and practices), the rigour of the evaluation and the industrial relevance of the reported
solutions, and to identify the gaps for the future research. Method: We conducted a systematic literature
review of 72 studies on software security patch management published from 2002 to March 2020, with
extended coverage until September 2020 through forward snowballing. Results: We identify 14 key
socio-technical challenges in security patch management with 6 common challenges encountered
throughout the process. Similarly, we provide a classification of the reported solutions mapped
onto the patch management process. The analysis also reveals that only 20.8% of the reported solutions
have been rigorously evaluated in industrial settings. Conclusion: Our results reveal that two-thirds
of the common challenges have not been directly addressed in the solutions and that most of them (37.5%)
address the challenges in one stage of the process. Based on the results that highlight the important
concerns in software security patch management and the lack of solutions, we recommend a list of
future research directions. This research study also provides useful insights into different
opportunities for practitioners to adopt new solutions and understand the variations of their
practical utility.

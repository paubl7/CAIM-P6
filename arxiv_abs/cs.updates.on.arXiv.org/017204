Robust physics discovery is of great interest for many scientific and engineering fields. Inspired
by the principle that a representative model is the one simplest possible, a new model selection
criteria considering both model's Parsimony and Sparsity is proposed. A Parsimony Enhanced Sparse
Bayesian Learning (PeSBL) method is developed for discovering the governing Partial Differential
Equations (PDEs) of nonlinear dynamical systems. Compared with the conventional Sparse Bayesian
Learning (SBL) method, the PeSBL method promotes parsimony of the learned model in addition to its
sparsity. In this method, the parsimony of model terms is evaluated using their locations in the
prescribed candidate library, for the first time, considering the increased complexity with the
power of polynomials and the order of spatial derivatives. Subsequently, the model parameters
are updated through Bayesian inference with the raw data. This procedure aims to reduce the error
associated with the possible loss of information in data preprocessing and numerical differentiation
prior to sparse regression. Results of numerical case studies indicate that the governing PDEs
of many canonical dynamical systems can be correctly identified using the proposed PeSBL method
from highly noisy data (up to 50% in the current study). Next, the proposed methodology is extended
for stochastic PDE learning where all parameters and modeling error are considered as random variables.
Hierarchical Bayesian Inference (HBI) is integrated with the proposed framework for stochastic
PDE learning from a population of observations. Finally, the proposed PeSBL is demonstrated for
system response prediction with uncertainties and anomaly diagnosis. Codes of all demonstrated
examples in this study are available on the website: https://github.com/ymlasu.

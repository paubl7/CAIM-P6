Background and Objectives: Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPGs) represent the foremost methodology
for sharing state-of-the-art research findings in the healthcare domain with medical practitioners
to limit practice variations, reduce clinical cost, improve the quality of care, and provide evidence
based treatment. However, extracting relevant knowledge from the plethora of CPGs is not feasible
for already burdened healthcare professionals, leading to large gaps between clinical findings
and real practices. It is therefore imperative that state-of-the-art Computing research, especially
machine learning is used to provide artificial intelligence based solution for extracting the
knowledge from CPGs and reducing the gap between healthcare research/guidelines and practice.
Methods: This research presents a novel methodology for knowledge extraction from CPGs to reduce
the gap and turn the latest research findings into clinical practice. First, our system classifies
the CPG sentences into four classes such as condition-action, condition-consequences, action,
and not-applicable based on the information presented in a sentence. We use deep learning with state-of-the-art
word embedding, improved word vectors technique in classification process. Second, it identifies
qualifier terms in the classified sentences, which assist in recognizing the condition and action
phrases in a sentence. Finally, the condition and action phrase are processed and transformed into
plain rule If Condition(s) Then Action format. Results: We evaluate the methodology on three different
domains guidelines including Hypertension, Rhinosinusitis, and Asthma. The deep learning model
classifies the CPG sentences with an accuracy of 95%. While rule extraction was validated by user-centric
approach, which achieved a Jaccard coefficient of 0.6, 0.7, and 0.4 with three human experts extracted
rules, respectively.

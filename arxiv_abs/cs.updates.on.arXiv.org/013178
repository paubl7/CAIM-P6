The transition from mild cognitive impairment (MCI) to Alzheimer's disease (AD) is of great interest
to clinical researchers. This phenomenon also serves as a valuable data source for quantitative
methodological researchers developing new approaches for classification. However, the growth
of machine learning (ML) approaches for classification may falsely lead many clinical researchers
to underestimate the value of logistic regression (LR), yielding equivalent or superior classification
accuracy over other ML methods. Further, in applications with many features that could be used for
classifying the transition, clinical researchers are often unaware of the relative value of different
selection procedures. In the present study, we sought to investigate the use of automated and theoretically-guided
feature selection techniques, and as well as the L-1 norm when applying different classification
techniques for predicting conversion from MCI to AD in a highly characterized and studied sample
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). We propose an alternative pre-selection
technique that utilizes an efficient feature selection based on clinical knowledge of brain regions
involved in AD. The present findings demonstrate how similar performance can be achieved using
user-guided pre-selection versus algorithmic feature selection techniques. Finally, we compare
the performance of a support vector machine (SVM) with that of logistic regression on multi-modal
data from ADNI. The present findings show that although SVM and other ML techniques are capable of
relatively accurate classification, similar or higher accuracy can often be achieved by LR, mitigating
SVM's necessity or value for many clinical researchers.

Black-box optimization is a very active area of research, with many new algorithms being developed
every year. This variety is needed, on the one hand, since different algorithms are most suitable
for different types of optimization problems. But the variety also poses a meta-problem: which
algorithm to choose for a given problem at hand? Past research has shown that per-instance algorithm
selection based on exploratory landscape analysis (ELA) can be an efficient mean to tackle this
meta-problem. Existing approaches, however, require the approximation of problem features based
on a significant number of samples, which are typically selected through uniform sampling or Latin
Hypercube Designs. The evaluation of these points is costly, and the benefit of an ELA-based algorithm
selection over a default algorithm must therefore be significant in order to pay off. One could hope
to by-pass the evaluations for the feature approximations by using the samples that a default algorithm
would anyway perform, i.e., by using the points of the default algorithm's trajectory. We analyze
in this paper how well such an approach can work. Concretely, we test how accurately trajectory-based
ELA approaches can predict the final solution quality of the CMA-ES after a fixed budget of function
evaluations. We observe that the loss of trajectory-based predictions can be surprisingly small
compared to the classical global sampling approach, if the remaining budget for which solution
quality shall be predicted is not too large. Feature selection, in contrast, did not show any advantage
in our experiments and rather led to worsened prediction accuracy. The inclusion of state variables
of CMA-ES only has a moderate effect on the prediction accuracy.

Context: Research at the intersection of cybersecurity, Machine Learning (ML), and Software Engineering
(SE) has recently taken significant steps in proposing countermeasures for detecting sophisticated
data exfiltration attacks. It is important to systematically review and synthesize the ML-based
data exfiltration countermeasures for building a body of knowledge on this important topic. Objective:
This paper aims at systematically reviewing ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures to identify
and classify ML approaches, feature engineering techniques, evaluation datasets, and performance
metrics used for these countermeasures. This review also aims at identifying gaps in research on
ML-based data exfiltration countermeasures. Method: We used a Systematic Literature Review (SLR)
method to select and review {92} papers. Results: The review has enabled us to (a) classify the ML
approaches used in the countermeasures into data-driven, and behaviour-driven approaches, (b)
categorize features into six types: behavioural, content-based, statistical, syntactical,
spatial and temporal, (c) classify the evaluation datasets into simulated, synthesized, and real
datasets and (d) identify 11 performance measures used by these studies. Conclusion: We conclude
that: (i) the integration of data-driven and behaviour-driven approaches should be explored;
(ii) There is a need of developing high quality and large size evaluation datasets; (iii) Incremental
ML model training should be incorporated in countermeasures; (iv) resilience to adversarial learning
should be considered and explored during the development of countermeasures to avoid poisoning
attacks; and (v) the use of automated feature engineering should be encouraged for efficiently
detecting data exfiltration attacks.

Minimization of deterministic automata on finite words results in a {\em canonical\/} automaton.
For deterministic automata on infinite words, no canonical minimal automaton exists, and a language
may have different minimal deterministic B\"uchi (DBW) or co-B\"uchi (DCW) automata. In recent
years, researchers have studied {\em good-for-games\/} (GFG) automata -- nondeterministic automata
that can resolve their nondeterministic choices in a way that only depends on the past. Several applications
of automata in formal methods, most notably synthesis, that are traditionally based on deterministic
automata, can instead be based on GFG automata. The {\em minimization\/} problem for DBW and DCW
is NP-complete, and it stays NP-complete for GFG B\"uchi and co-B\"uchi automata. On the other hand,
minimization of GFG co-B\"uchi automata with {\em transition-based\/} acceptance (GFG-tNCWs)
can be solved in polynomial time. In these automata, acceptance is defined by a set $\alpha$ of transitions,
and a run is accepting if it traverses transitions in $\alpha$ only finitely often. This raises the
question of canonicity of minimal deterministic and GFG automata with transition-based acceptance.
In this paper we study this problem. We start with GFG-tNCWs and show that the safe components (that
is, these obtained by restricting the transitions to these not in $\alpha$) of all minimal GFG-tNCWs
are isomorphic, and that by saturating the automaton with transitions in $\alpha$ we get isomorphism
among all minimal GFG-tNCWs. Thus, a canonical form for minimal GFG-tNCWs can be obtained in polynomial
time. We continue to DCWs with transition-based acceptance (tDCWs), and their dual tDBWs. We show
that here, while no canonical form for minimal automata exists, restricting attention to the safe
components is useful, and implies that the only minimal tDCWs that have no canonical form are these
for which the transition to the GFG model results in strictly smaller automaton, which do have a canonical
minimal form.

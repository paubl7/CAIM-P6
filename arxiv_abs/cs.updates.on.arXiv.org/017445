Reconfigurable architectures, such as FPGAs, enable the execution of code at the electronics level,
avoiding the assumptions imposed by the general purpose black-box micro-architectures of CPUs
and GPUs. Such tailored execution can result in increased performance and power efficiency, and
as the HPC community moves towards exascale an important question is the role such hardware technologies
can play in future supercomputers. In this paper we explore the porting of the PW advection kernel,
an important code component used in a variety of atmospheric simulations and accounting for around
40\% of the runtime of the popular Met Office NERC Cloud model (MONC). Building upon previous work
which ported this kernel to an older generation of Xilinx FPGA, we target latest generation Xilinx
Alveo U280 and Intel Stratix 10 FPGAs. Exploring the development of a dataflow design which is performance
portable between vendors, we then describe implementation differences between the tool chains
and compare kernel performance between FPGA hardware. This is followed by a more general performance
comparison, scaling up the number of kernels on the Xilinx Alveo and Intel Stratix 10, against a 24
core Xeon Platinum Cascade Lake CPU and NVIDIA Tesla V100 GPU. When overlapping the transfer of data
to and from the boards with compute, the FPGA solutions considerably outperform the CPU and, whilst
falling short of the GPU in terms of performance, demonstrate power usage benefits, with the Alveo
being especially power efficient. The result of this work is a comparison and set of design techniques
that apply both to this specific atmospheric advection kernel on Xilinx and Intel FPGAs, and that
are also of interest more widely when looking to accelerate HPC codes on a variety of reconfigurable
architectures.

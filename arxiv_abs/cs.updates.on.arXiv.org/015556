The most effective data-driven methods for human activities recognition (HAR) are based on supervised
learning applied to the continuous stream of sensors data. However, these methods perform well
on restricted sets of activities in domains for which there is a fully labeled dataset. It is still
a challenge to cope with the intra- and inter-variability of activity execution among different
subjects in large scale real world deployment. Semi-supervised learning approaches for HAR have
been proposed to address the challenge of acquiring the large amount of labeled data that is necessary
in realistic settings. However, their centralised architecture incurs in the scalability and
privacy problems when the process involves a large number of users. Federated Learning (FL) is a
promising paradigm to address these problems. However, the FL methods that have been proposed for
HAR assume that the participating users can always obtain labels to train their local models. In
this work, we propose FedHAR: a novel hybrid method for HAR that combines semi-supervised and federated
learning. Indeed, FedHAR combines active learning and label propagation to semi-automatically
annotate the local streams of unlabeled sensor data, and it relies on FL to build a global activity
model in a scalable and privacy-aware fashion. FedHAR also includes a transfer learning strategy
to personalize the global model on each user. We evaluated our method on two public datasets, showing
that FedHAR reaches recognition rates and personalization capabilities similar to state-of-the-art
FL supervised approaches. As a major advantage, FedHAR only requires a very limited number of annotated
data to populate a pre-trained model and a small number of active learning questions that quickly
decrease while using the system, leading to an effective and scalable solution for the data scarcity
problem of HAR.

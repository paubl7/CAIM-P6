Cervical cancer is a malignant tumor that seriously threatens women's health, and is one of the most
common that affects women worldwide. For its early detection, colposcopic images of the cervix
are used for searching for possible injuries or abnormalities. An inherent characteristic of these
images is the presence of specular reflections (brightness) that make it difficult to observe some
regions, which might imply misdiagnosis. In this paper, a new strategy based on neural networks
is introduced for eliminating specular reflections and estimating the unobserved anatomical
cervix portion under the bright zones. For overcoming the fact that the ground truth corresponding
to the specular reflection regions is always unknown, the new strategy proposes the supervised
training of a neural network to learn how to restore any hidden regions of colposcopic images. Once
the specular reflections are identified, they are removed from the image, and the previously trained
network is used to fulfill these deleted areas. The quality of the processed images was evaluated
quantitatively and qualitatively. In 21 of the 22 evaluated images, the detected specular reflections
were eliminated, whereas, in the remaining one, these reflections were almost completely eliminated.
The distribution of the colors and the content of the restored images are similar to those of the originals.
The evaluation carried out by a specialist in Cervix Pathology concluded that, after eliminating
the specular reflections, the anatomical and physiological elements of the cervix are observable
in the restored images, which facilitates the medical diagnosis of cervical pathologies. Our method
has the potential to improve the early detection of cervical cancer.

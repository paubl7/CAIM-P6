English has a convoluted relationship between its pronunciation and spelling, which obscures
its phonological structure for early literacy learners. This convoluted relationship has implications
for early literacy software, particularly for open-ended, child-driven designs. A tempting way
to bypass this issue is to use manipulables (blocks) that are directly tied to phonemes. However,
creating phoneme-based blocks leads to two design challenges: (a) how to represent phonemes visually
in a child-accessible way and (b) how to account for context-dependent spelling. In the present
work, we approached these challenges by developing a set of animated, onomatopoeia-based mnemonic
characters, one per phoneme, that can take the shape of different graphemes.We applied the characters
to a construction-based literacy app to simplify independent word-building for literacy beginners.
We tested the app during a 13-week-long period with 4- to 5-year-olds in kindergarten classrooms.
Children showed visible interest in the characters and properly grasped the principles of their
functioning. However, the blocks were not sufficient to scaffold independent word building, leading
children to rely on other scaffolding mechanisms. To test the characters' efficiency as mnemonics,
we evaluated their effect on the speed and accuracy of finding phonemes on a keyboard. The results
suggest that there were both children who benefitted from the characters in this task and those who
performed better without them. The factors that differentiated these two categories are currently
unclear. To help further research on phonetic mnemonics in literacy learning software, we are making
the characters available to the research community.

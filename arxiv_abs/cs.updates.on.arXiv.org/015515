Objective: Machine learning algorithms are now widely used in predicting acute events for clinical
applications. While most of such prediction applications are developed to predict the risk of a
particular acute event at one hospital, few efforts have been made in extending the developed solutions
to other events or to different hospitals. We provide a scalable solution to extend the process of
clinical risk prediction model development of multiple diseases and their deployment in different
Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems. Materials and Methods: We defined a generic process for
clinical risk prediction model development. A calibration tool has been created to automate the
model generation process. We applied the model calibration process at four hospitals, and generated
risk prediction models for delirium, sepsis and acute kidney injury (AKI) respectively at each
of these hospitals. Results: The delirium risk prediction models achieved area under the receiver-operating
characteristic curve (AUROC) ranging from 0.82 to 0.95 over different stages of a hospital stay
on the test datasets of the four hospitals. The sepsis models achieved AUROC ranging from 0.88 to
0.95, and the AKI models achieved AUROC ranging from 0.85 to 0.92. Discussion: The scalability discussed
in this paper is based on building common data representations (syntactic interoperability) between
EHRs stored in different hospitals. Semantic interoperability, a more challenging requirement
that different EHRs share the same meaning of data, e.g. a same lab coding system, is not mandated
with our approach. Conclusions: Our study describes a method to develop and deploy clinical risk
prediction models in a scalable way. We demonstrate its feasibility by developing risk prediction
models for three diseases across four hospitals.

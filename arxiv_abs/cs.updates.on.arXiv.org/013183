A primary goal of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Warn-on-Forecast
(WoF) project is to provide rapidly updating probabilistic guidance to human forecasters for short-term
(e.g., 0-3 h) severe weather forecasts. Maximizing the usefulness of probabilistic severe weather
guidance from an ensemble of convection-allowing model forecasts requires calibration. In this
study, we compare the skill of a simple method using updraft helicity against a series of machine
learning (ML) algorithms for calibrating WoFS severe weather guidance. ML models are often used
to calibrate severe weather guidance since they leverage multiple variables and discover useful
patterns in complex datasets. \indent Our dataset includes WoF System (WoFS) ensemble forecasts
available every 5 minutes out to 150 min of lead time from the 2017-2019 NOAA Hazardous Weather Testbed
Spring Forecasting Experiments (81 dates). Using a novel ensemble storm track identification
method, we extracted three sets of predictors from the WoFS forecasts: intra-storm state variables,
near-storm environment variables, and morphological attributes of the ensemble storm tracks.
We then trained random forests, gradient-boosted trees, and logistic regression algorithms to
predict which WoFS 30-min ensemble storm tracks will correspond to a tornado, severe hail, and/or
severe wind report. For the simple method, we extracted the ensemble probability of 2-5 km updraft
helicity (UH) exceeding a threshold (tuned per severe weather hazard) from each ensemble storm
track. The three ML algorithms discriminated well for all three hazards and produced more reliable
probabilities than the UH-based predictions. Overall, the results suggest that ML-based calibrations
of dynamical ensemble output can improve short term, storm-scale severe weather probabilistic
guidance

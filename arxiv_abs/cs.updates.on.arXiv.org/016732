The utilization of computer technology to solve problems in medical scenarios has attracted considerable
attention in recent years, which still has great potential and space for exploration. Among them,
machine learning has been widely used in the prediction, diagnosis and even treatment of Sepsis.
However, state-of-the-art methods require large amounts of labeled medical data for supervised
learning. In real-world applications, the lack of labeled data will cause enormous obstacles if
one hospital wants to deploy a new Sepsis detection system. Different from the supervised learning
setting, we need to use known information (e.g., from another hospital with rich labeled data) to
help build a model with acceptable performance, i.e., transfer learning. In this paper, we propose
a semi-supervised optimal transport with self-paced ensemble framework for Sepsis early detection,
called SPSSOT, to transfer knowledge from the other that has rich labeled data. In SPSSOT, we first
extract the same clinical indicators from the source domain (e.g., hospital with rich labeled data)
and the target domain (e.g., hospital with little labeled data), then we combine the semi-supervised
domain adaptation based on optimal transport theory with self-paced under-sampling to avoid a
negative transfer possibly caused by covariate shift and class imbalance. On the whole, SPSSOT
is an end-to-end transfer learning method for Sepsis early detection which can automatically select
suitable samples from two domains respectively according to the number of iterations and align
feature space of two domains. Extensive experiments on two open clinical datasets demonstrate
that comparing with other methods, our proposed SPSSOT, can significantly improve the AUC values
with only 1% labeled data in the target domain in two transfer learning scenarios, MIMIC $rightarrow$
Challenge and Challenge $rightarrow$ MIMIC.

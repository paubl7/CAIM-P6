Approximate computing is an emerging paradigm to improve power and performance efficiency for
error-resilient application. Recent approximate adders have significantly extended the design
space of accuracy-power configurable approximate adders, and find optimal designs by exploring
the design space. In this paper, a new energy-efficient heterogeneous block-based approximate
adder (HBBA) is proposed; which is a generic/configurable model that can be transformed to a particular
adder by defining some configurations. An HBBA, in general, is composed of heterogeneous sub-adders,
where each sub-adder can have a different configuration. A set of configurations of all the sub-adders
in an HBBA defines its configuration. The block-based adders are approximated through inexact
logic configuration and truncated carry chains. HBBA increases design space providing additional
design points that fall on the Pareto-front and offer better power-accuracy trade-off compared
to other configurations. Furthermore, to avoid Mont-Carlo simulations, we propose an analytical
modelling technique to evaluate the probability of error and Probability Mass Function (PMF) of
error value. Moreover, the estimation method estimates delay, area and power of heterogeneous
block-based approximate adders. Thus, based on the analytical model and estimation method, the
optimal configuration under a given error constraint can be selected from the whole design space
of the proposed adder model by exhaustive search. The simulation results show that our HBBA provides
improved accuracy in terms of error metrics compared to some state-of-the-art approximate adders.
HBBA with 32 bits length serves about 15% reduction in area and up to 17% reduction in energy compared
to state-of-the-art approximate adders.

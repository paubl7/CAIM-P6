Advances in vehicular communication technologies are expected to facilitate cooperative driving.
Connected and Automated Vehicles (CAVs) are able to collaboratively plan and execute driving maneuvers
by sharing their perceptual knowledge and future plans. In this paper, an architecture for autonomous
navigation of tight multi-lane platoons travelling on public roads is presented. Using the proposed
approach, CAVs are able to form single or multi-lane platoons of various geometrical configurations.
They are able to reshape and adjust their configurations according to changes in the environment.
The proposed architecture consists of two main components: an offline motion planner system and
an online hierarchical control system. The motion planner uses an optimization-based approach
for cooperative formation and reconfiguration in tight spaces. A constrained optimization scheme
is used to plan smooth, dynamically feasible and collision-free trajectories for all the vehicles
within the platoon. The paper addresses online computation limitations by employing a family of
maneuvers precomputed offline and stored on a look-up table on the vehicles. The online hierarchical
control system is composed of three levels: a traffic operation system (TOS), a decision-maker,
and a path-follower. The TOS determines the desired platoon reconfiguration. The decision-maker
checks the feasibility of the reconfiguration plan. The reconfiguration maneuver is executed
by a low-level path-following feedback controller in real-time. The effectiveness of the approach
is demonstrated through simulations of three case studies: 1) formation reconfiguration 2) obstacle
avoidance, and 3) benchmarking against behavior-based planning in which the desired formation
is achieved using a sequence of motion primitives. Videos and software can be found online https://github.com/RoyaFiroozi/Centralized-Planning.

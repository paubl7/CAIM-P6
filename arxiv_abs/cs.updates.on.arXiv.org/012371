The purpose of this study was to develop a fully-automated segmentation algorithm, robust to various
density enhancing lung abnormalities, to facilitate rapid quantitative analysis of computed
tomography images. A polymorphic training approach is proposed, in which both specifically labeled
left and right lungs of humans with COPD, and nonspecifically labeled lungs of animals with acute
lung injury, were incorporated into training a single neural network. The resulting network is
intended for predicting left and right lung regions in humans with or without diffuse opacification
and consolidation. Performance of the proposed lung segmentation algorithm was extensively evaluated
on CT scans of subjects with COPD, confirmed COVID-19, lung cancer, and IPF, despite no labeled training
data of the latter three diseases. Lobar segmentations were obtained using the left and right lung
segmentation as input to the LobeNet algorithm. Regional lobar analysis was performed using hierarchical
clustering to identify radiographic subtypes of COVID-19. The proposed lung segmentation algorithm
was quantitatively evaluated using semi-automated and manually-corrected segmentations in
87 COVID-19 CT images, achieving an average symmetric surface distance of $0.495 \pm 0.309$ mm and
Dice coefficient of $0.985 \pm 0.011$. Hierarchical clustering identified four radiographical
phenotypes of COVID-19 based on lobar fractions of consolidated and poorly aerated tissue. Lower
left and lower right lobes were consistently more afflicted with poor aeration and consolidation.
However, the most severe cases demonstrated involvement of all lobes. The polymorphic training
approach was able to accurately segment COVID-19 cases with diffuse consolidation without requiring
COVID-19 cases for training.

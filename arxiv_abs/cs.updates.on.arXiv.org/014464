Bayesian methods have been widely used in the last two decades to infer statistical properties of
spatially variable coefficients in partial differential equations from measurements of the solutions
of these equations. Yet, in many cases the number of variables used to parameterize these coefficients
is large, and obtaining meaningful statistics of their values is difficult using simple sampling
methods such as the basic Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm -- in particular if the inverse problem
is ill-conditioned or ill-posed. As a consequence, many advanced sampling methods have been described
in the literature that converge faster than MH, for example by exploiting hierarchies of statistical
models or hierarchies of discretizations of the underlying differential equation. At the same
time, it remains difficult for the reader of the literature to quantify the advantages of these algorithms
because there is no commonly used benchmark. This paper presents a benchmark for the Bayesian inversion
of inverse problems -- namely, the determination of a spatially-variable coefficient, discretized
by 64 values, in a Poisson equation, based on point measurements of the solution -- that fills the
gap between widely used simple test cases (such as superpositions of Gaussians) and real applications
that are difficult to replicate for developers of sampling algorithms. We provide a complete description
of the test case, and provide an open source implementation that can serve as the basis for further
experiments. We have also computed $2\times 10^{11}$ samples, at a cost of some 30 CPU years, of the
posterior probability distribution from which we have generated detailed and accurate statistics
against which other sampling algorithms can be tested.

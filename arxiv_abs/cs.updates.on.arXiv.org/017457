Frozen sectioning (FS) is the preparation method of choice for microscopic evaluation of tissues
during surgical operations. The high speed of the procedure allows pathologists to rapidly assess
the key microscopic features, such as tumour margins and malignant status to guide surgical decision-making
and minimise disruptions to the course of the operation. However, FS is prone to introducing many
misleading artificial structures (histological artefacts), such as nuclear ice crystals, compression,
and cutting artefacts, hindering timely and accurate diagnostic judgement of the pathologist.
Additional training and prolonged experience is often required to make highly effective and time-critical
diagnosis on frozen sections. On the other hand, the gold standard tissue preparation technique
of formalin-fixation and paraffin-embedding (FFPE) provides significantly superior image quality,
but is a very time-consuming process (12-48 hours), making it unsuitable for intra-operative use.
In this paper, we propose an artificial intelligence (AI) method that improves FS image quality
by computationally transforming frozen-sectioned whole-slide images (FS-WSIs) into whole-slide
FFPE-style images in minutes. AI-FFPE rectifies FS artefacts with the guidance of an attention
mechanism that puts a particular emphasis on artefacts while utilising a self-regularization
mechanism established between FS input image and synthesized FFPE-style image that preserves
clinically relevant features. As a result, AI-FFPE method successfully generates FFPE-style
images without significantly extending tissue processing time and consequently improves diagnostic
accuracy. We demonstrate the efficacy of AI-FFPE on lung and brain frozen sections using a variety
of different qualitative and quantitative metrics including visual Turing tests from 20 board
certified pathologists.

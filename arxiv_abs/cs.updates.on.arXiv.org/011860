Unpaired image-to-image translation has been applied successfully to natural images but has received
very little attention for manifold-valued data such as in diffusion tensor imaging (DTI). The non-Euclidean
nature of DTI prevents current generative adversarial networks (GANs) from generating plausible
images and has mainly limited their application to diffusion MRI scalar maps, such as fractional
anisotropy (FA) or mean diffusivity (MD). Even if these scalar maps are clinically useful, they
mostly ignore fiber orientations and therefore have limited applications for analyzing brain
fibers. Here, we propose a manifold-aware CycleGAN that learns the generation of high-resolution
DTI from unpaired T1w images. We formulate the objective as a Wasserstein distance minimization
problem of data distributions on a Riemannian manifold of symmetric positive definite 3x3 matrices
SPD(3), using adversarial and cycle-consistency losses. To ensure that the generated diffusion
tensors lie on the SPD(3) manifold, we exploit the theoretical properties of the exponential and
logarithm maps of the Log-Euclidean metric. We demonstrate that, unlike standard GANs, our method
is able to generate realistic high-resolution DTI that can be used to compute diffusion-based metrics
and potentially run fiber tractography algorithms. To evaluate our model's performance, we compute
the cosine similarity between the generated tensors principal orientation and their ground-truth
orientation, the mean squared error (MSE) of their derived FA values and the Log-Euclidean distance
between the tensors. We demonstrate that our method produces 2.5 times better FA MSE than a standard
CycleGAN and up to 30% better cosine similarity than a manifold-aware Wasserstein GAN while synthesizing
sharp high-resolution DTI.

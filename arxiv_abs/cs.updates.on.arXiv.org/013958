For multilayer structures, interfacial failure is one of the most important elements related to
device reliability. For cohesive zone modelling, traction-separation relations represent the
adhesive interactions across interfaces. However, existing theoretical models do not currently
capture traction-separation relations that have been extracted using direct methods, particularly
under mixed-mode conditions. Given the complexity of the problem, models derived from the neural
network approach are attractive. Although they can be trained to fit data along the loading paths
taken in a particular set of mixed-mode fracture experiments, they may fail to obey physical laws
for paths not covered by the training data sets. In this paper, a thermodynamically consistent neural
network (TCNN) approach is established to model the constitutive behavior of interfaces when faced
with sparse training data sets. Accordingly, three conditions are examined and implemented here:
(i) thermodynamic consistency, (ii) maximum energy dissipation path control and (iii) J-integral
conservation. These conditions are treated as constraints and are implemented as such in the loss
function. The feasibility of this approach is demonstrated by comparing the modeling results with
a range of physical constraints. Moreover, a Bayesian optimization algorithm is then adopted to
optimize the weight factors associated with each of the constraints in order to overcome convergence
issues that can arise when multiple constraints are present. The resultant numerical implementation
of the ideas presented here produced well-behaved, mixed-mode traction separation surfaces that
maintained the fidelity of the experimental data that was provided as input. The proposed approach
heralds a new autonomous, point-to-point constitutive modeling concept for interface mechanics.

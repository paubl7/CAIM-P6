Optimization is at the heart of machine learning, statistics and many applied scientific disciplines.
It also has a long history in physics, ranging from the minimal action principle to finding ground
states of disordered systems such as spin glasses. Proximal algorithms form a class of methods that
are broadly applicable and are particularly well-suited to nonsmooth, constrained, large-scale,
and distributed optimization problems. There are essentially five proximal algorithms currently
known: Forward-backward splitting, Tseng splitting, Douglas-Rachford, alternating direction
method of multipliers, and the more recent Davis-Yin. These methods sit on a higher level of abstraction
compared to gradient-based ones, with deep roots in nonlinear functional analysis. We show that
all of these methods are actually different discretizations of a single differential equation,
namely, the simple gradient flow which dates back to Cauchy (1847). An important aspect behind many
of the success stories in machine learning relies on "accelerating" the convergence of first-order
methods. We show that similar discretization schemes applied to Newton's equation with an additional
dissipative force, which we refer to as accelerated gradient flow, allow us to obtain accelerated
variants of all these proximal algorithms -- the majority of which are new although some recover
known cases in the literature. Furthermore, we extend these methods to stochastic settings, allowing
us to make connections with Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations. Similar ideas apply to gradient
descent, heavy ball, and Nesterov's method which are simpler. Our results therefore provide a unified
framework from which several important optimization methods are nothing but simulations of classical
dissipative systems.

The Bluetooth sensor embedded in mobile phones provides an unobtrusive, continuous, and cost-efficient
means to capture individuals' proximity information, such as the nearby Bluetooth devices count
(NBDC). The continuous NBDC data can partially reflect individuals' behaviors and status, such
as social connections and interactions, working status, mobility, and social isolation and loneliness,
which were found to be significantly associated with depression by previous survey-based studies.
This paper aims to explore the NBDC data's value in predicting depressive symptom severity as measured
via the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8). The data used in this paper included 2,886
bi-weekly PHQ-8 records collected from 316 participants recruited from three study sites in the
Netherlands, Spain, and the UK as part of the EU RADAR-CNS study. From the NBDC data two weeks prior
to each PHQ-8 score, we extracted 49 Bluetooth features, including statistical features and nonlinear
features for measuring periodicity and regularity of individuals' life rhythms. Linear mixed-effect
models were used to explore associations between Bluetooth features and the PHQ-8 score. We then
applied hierarchical Bayesian linear regression models to predict the PHQ-8 score from the extracted
Bluetooth features. A number of significant associations were found between Bluetooth features
and depressive symptom severity. Compared with commonly used machine learning models, the proposed
hierarchical Bayesian linear regression model achieved the best prediction metrics, R2= 0.526,
and root mean squared error (RMSE) of 3.891. Bluetooth features can explain an extra 18.8% of the
variance in the PHQ-8 score relative to the baseline model without Bluetooth features (R2=0.338,
RMSE = 4.547).

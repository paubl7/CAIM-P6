Video predictive understanding encompasses a wide range of efforts that are concerned with the
anticipation of the unobserved future from the current as well as historical video observations.
Action prediction is a major sub-area of video predictive understanding and is the focus of this
review. This sub-area has two major subdivisions: early action recognition and future action prediction.
Early action recognition is concerned with recognizing an ongoing action as soon as possible. Future
action prediction is concerned with the anticipation of actions that follow those previously observed.
In either case, the \textbf{\textit{causal}} relationship between the past, current, and potential
future information is the main focus. Various mathematical tools such as Markov Chains, Gaussian
Processes, Auto-Regressive modeling, and Bayesian recursive filtering are widely adopted jointly
with computer vision techniques for these two tasks. However, these approaches face challenges
such as the curse of dimensionality, poor generalization, and constraints from domain-specific
knowledge. Recently, structures that rely on deep convolutional neural networks and recurrent
neural networks have been extensively proposed for improving the performance of existing vision
tasks, in general, and action prediction tasks, in particular. However, they have their own shortcomings,
\eg reliance on massive training data and lack of strong theoretical underpinnings. In this survey,
we start by introducing the major sub-areas of the broad area of video predictive understanding,
which recently have received intensive attention and proven to have practical value. Next, a thorough
review of various early action recognition and future action prediction algorithms are provided
with suitably organized divisions. Finally, we conclude our discussion with future research directions.

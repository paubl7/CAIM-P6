Deep convolutional neural networks have achieved remarkable improvements in facial recognition
performance. Similar kinds of developments, e.g. deconvolutional neural networks, have shown
impressive results for reconstructing face images from their corresponding embeddings in the
latent space. This poses a severe security risk which necessitates the protection of stored deep
face embeddings in order to prevent from misuse, e.g. identity fraud. In this work, an unlinkable
improved deep face fuzzy vault-based template protection scheme is presented. To this end, a feature
transformation method is introduced which maps fixed-length real-valued deep face embeddings
to integer-valued feature sets. As part of said feature transformation, a detailed analysis of
different feature quantisation and binarisation techniques is conducted using features extracted
with a state-of-the-art deep convolutional neural network trained with the additive angular margin
loss (ArcFace). At key binding, obtained feature sets are locked in an unlinkable improved fuzzy
vault. For key retrieval, the efficiency of different polynomial reconstruction techniques is
investigated. The proposed feature transformation method and template protection scheme are
agnostic of the biometric characteristic and, thus, can be applied to virtually any biometric features
computed by a deep neural network. For the best configuration, a false non-match rate below 1% at
a false match rate of 0.01%, is achieved in cross-database experiments on the FERET and FRGCv2 face
databases. On average, a security level of up to approximately 28 bits is obtained. This work presents
the first effective face-based fuzzy vault scheme providing privacy protection of facial reference
data as well as digital key derivation from face.

Taking the deep learning-based algorithms into account has become a crucial way to boost object
detection performance in aerial images. While various neural network representations have been
developed, previous works are still inefficient to investigate the noise-resilient performance,
especially on aerial images with noise taken by the cameras with telephoto lenses, and most of the
research is concentrated in the field of denoising. Of course, denoising usually requires an additional
computational burden to obtain higher quality images, while noise-resilient is more of a description
of the robustness of the network itself to different noises, which is an attribute of the algorithm
itself. For this reason, the work will be started by analyzing the noise-resilient performance
of the neural network, and then propose two hypotheses to build a noise-resilient structure. Based
on these hypotheses, we compare the noise-resilient ability of the Oct-ResNet with frequency division
processing and the commonly used ResNet. In addition, previous feature pyramid networks used for
aerial object detection tasks are not specifically designed for the frequency division feature
maps of the Oct-ResNet, and they usually lack attention to bridging the semantic gap between diverse
feature maps from different depths. On the basis of this, a novel octave convolution-based semantic
attention feature pyramid network (OcSaFPN) is proposed to get higher accuracy in object detection
with noise. The proposed algorithm tested on three datasets demonstrates that the proposed OcSaFPN
achieves a state-of-the-art detection performance with Gaussian noise or multiplicative noise.
In addition, more experiments have proved that the OcSaFPN structure can be easily added to existing
algorithms, and the noise-resilient ability can be effectively improved.

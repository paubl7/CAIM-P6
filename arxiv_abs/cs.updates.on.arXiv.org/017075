Due to its open-source nature, Android operating system has been the main target of attackers to
exploit. Malware creators always perform different code obfuscations on their apps to hide malicious
activities. Features extracted from these obfuscated samples through program analysis contain
many useless and disguised features, which leads to many false negatives. To address the issue,
in this paper, we demonstrate that obfuscation-resilient malware analysis can be achieved through
contrastive learning. We take the Android malware classification as an example to demonstrate
our analysis. The key insight behind our analysis is that contrastive learning can be used to reduce
the difference introduced by obfuscation while amplifying the difference between malware and
benign apps (or other types of malware). Based on the proposed analysis, we design a system that can
achieve robust and interpretable classification of Android malware. To achieve robust classification,
we perform contrastive learning on malware samples to learn an encoder that can automatically extract
robust features from malware samples. To achieve interpretable classification, we transform
the function call graph of a sample into an image by centrality analysis. Then the corresponding
heatmaps are obtained by visualization techniques. These heatmaps can help users understand why
the malware is classified as this family. We implement IFDroid and perform extensive evaluations
on two widely used datasets. Experimental results show that IFDroid is superior to state-of-the-art
Android malware familial classification systems. Moreover, IFDroid is capable of maintaining
98.2% true positive rate on classifying 8,112 obfuscated malware samples.

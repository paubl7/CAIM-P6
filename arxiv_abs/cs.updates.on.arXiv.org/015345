Several researches and evidence show the increasing likelihood of pandemics (large-scale outbreaks
of infectious disease) which has far reaching sequels in all aspects of human lives ranging from
rapid mortality rates to economic and social disruption across the world. In the recent time, COVID-19
(Coronavirus Disease 2019) pandemic disrupted normal human lives, and motivated by the urgent
need of combating COVID-19, researchers have put significant efforts in modelling and analysing
the disease spread patterns for effective preventive measures (in addition to developing pharmaceutical
solutions, like vaccine). In this regards, it is absolutely necessary to develop an analytics framework
by extracting and incorporating the knowledge of heterogeneous datasources to deliver insights
in improving administrative policy and enhance the preparedness to combat the pandemic. Specifically,
human mobility, travel history and other transport statistics have significant impacts on the
spread of any infectious disease. In this direction, this paper proposes a spatio-temporal knowledge
mining framework, named STOPPAGE to model the impact of human mobility and other contextual information
over large geographic area in different temporal scales. The framework has two major modules: (i)
Spatio-temporal data and computing infrastructure using fog/edge based architecture; and (ii)
Spatio-temporal data analytics module to efficiently extract knowledge from heterogeneous data
sources. Typically, we develop a Pandemic-knowledge graph to discover correlations among mobility
information and disease spread, a deep learning architecture to predict the next hot-spot zones;
and provide necessary support in home-health monitoring utilizing Femtolet and fog/edge based
solutions. The experimental evaluations on real-life datasets related to COVID-19 in India illustrate
the efficacy of the proposed methods.

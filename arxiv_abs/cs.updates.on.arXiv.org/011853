The Learning with Errors (LWE) problem is an $\mathcal{NP}$-hard problem that lies the foundation
of several cryptographic algorithms. Generalizing this principle, several cryptosystems based
on the closely related Ring Learning with Errors (RLWE) problem have been proposed within the NIST
PQC standardization process, e.g., the systems LAC and NewHope. The combination of encryption
and decryption for these kinds of algorithms can be interpreted as data transmission over noisy
channels. To the best of our knowledge this paper is the first work that analyzes the capacity of this
channel. In particular, we present lower bounds on the capacity, which show that the transmission
rate can be significantly increased compared to standard proposals in the literature. Furthermore,
under the assumption of stochastically independent coefficient failures we give achievability
bounds as well as concrete code constructions achieving a decryption failure rate (DFR) less than
$2^{-112}$ for LAC and less than $2^{-216}$ for NewHope for their highest proposed security levels.
Our results show that the data rate of the encryption scheme is significantly increased for NewHope,
namely by factor of $7$ and for LAC by a factor of $2$. This is partly based on choosing larger alphabet
sizes. Furthermore we show how to significantly decrease the decryption failure rate compared
to the original proposals while achieving the same bit rate. We also show that the measures we take
to achieve these results have no negative impact on the security level. Thus, by means of our constructions,
we can either increase the total bit rate while guaranteeing the same DFR or for the same bit rate,
we can significantly reduce the DFR (e.g., for NewHope from $2^{-216}$ to $2^{-12764}$).

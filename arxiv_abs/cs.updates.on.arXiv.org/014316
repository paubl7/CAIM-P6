Aims: Our Gulf War Illness (GWI) study conducts combinatorial screening of many interactive neural
and humoral biomarkers in order to establish predictive, diagnostic, and therapeutic targets.
We encounter obstacles at every stage of the biomarker discovery process, from sample acquisition,
bio-marker extraction to multi-aspect, multi-way interaction analysis, due to the study complexity
and lack of support for complex data problem solutions. We introduce a novel data platform, named
ROSALIND, to overcome the challenges, foster healthy and vital collaborations and advance scientific
inquiries. Main methods: ROSALIND is a researcher-centered, study-specific data platform. It
provides vital support of individual creativity and effort in collaborative research. We follow
the principles etched in the platform name - ROSALIND stands for resource organisms with self-governed
accessibility, linkability, integrability, neutrality, and dependability. We translate, encode
and implement the principles in the platform with novel use of advanced concepts and techniques
to ensure and protect data integrity and research integrity. From a researcher's vantage point,
ROSALIND embodies nuance utilities and advanced functionalities in one system, beyond conventional
storage, archive and data management. Key findings: The deployment of ROSALIND in our GWI study
in recent 12 months has accelerated the pace of data experiment and analysis, removed numerous error
sources, and increased research quality and productivity. Significance: ROSALIND seems the first
to address data integrity and research integrity in tandem with digital measures and means. It also
promises a new type of distributed research networks with individualized data platforms connected
in various self-organized collaboration configurations.

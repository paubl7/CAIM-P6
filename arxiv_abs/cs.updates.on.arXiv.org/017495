Tiny Machine Learning (TML) is a new research area whose goal is to design machine and deep learning
techniques able to operate in Embedded Systems and IoT units, hence satisfying the severe technological
constraints on memory, computation, and energy characterizing these pervasive devices. Interestingly,
the related literature mainly focused on reducing the computational and memory demand of the inference
phase of machine and deep learning models. At the same time, the training is typically assumed to
be carried out in Cloud or edge computing systems (due to the larger memory and computational requirements).
This assumption results in TML solutions that might become obsolete when the process generating
the data is affected by concept drift (e.g., due to periodicity or seasonality effect, faults or
malfunctioning affecting sensors or actuators, or changes in the users' behavior), a common situation
in real-world application scenarios. For the first time in the literature, this paper introduces
a Tiny Machine Learning for Concept Drift (TML-CD) solution based on deep learning feature extractors
and a k-nearest neighbors classifier integrating a hybrid adaptation module able to deal with concept
drift affecting the data-generating process. This adaptation module continuously updates (in
a passive way) the knowledge base of TML-CD and, at the same time, employs a Change Detection Test
to inspect for changes (in an active way) to quickly adapt to concept drift by removing the obsolete
knowledge. Experimental results on both image and audio benchmarks show the effectiveness of the
proposed solution, whilst the porting of TML-CD on three off-the-shelf micro-controller units
shows the feasibility of what is proposed in real-world pervasive systems.

Active fire detection in satellite imagery is of critical importance to the management of environmental
conservation policies, supporting decision-making and law enforcement. This is a well established
field, with many techniques being proposed over the years, usually based on pixel or region-level
comparisons involving sensor-specific thresholds and neighborhood statistics. In this paper,
we address the problem of active fire detection using deep learning techniques. In recent years,
deep learning techniques have been enjoying an enormous success in many fields, but their use for
active fire detection is relatively new, with open questions and demand for datasets and architectures
for evaluation. This paper addresses these issues by introducing a new large-scale dataset for
active fire detection, with over 150,000 image patches (more than 200 GB of data) extracted from
Landsat-8 images captured around the world in August and September 2020, containing wildfires
in several locations. The dataset was split in two parts, and contains 10-band spectral images with
associated outputs, produced by three well known handcrafted algorithms for active fire detection
in the first part, and manually annotated masks in the second part. We also present a study on how different
convolutional neural network architectures can be used to approximate these handcrafted algorithms,
and how models trained on automatically segmented patches can be combined to achieve better performance
than the original algorithms - with the best combination having 87.2% precision and 92.4% recall
on our manually annotated dataset. The proposed dataset, source codes and trained models are available
on Github (https://github.com/pereira-gha/activefire), creating opportunities for further
advances in the field

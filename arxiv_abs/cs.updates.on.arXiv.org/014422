Physical photographs now can be conveniently scanned by smartphones and stored forever as a digital
version, but the scanned photos are not restored well. One solution is to train a supervised deep
neural network on many digital photos and the corresponding scanned photos. However, human annotation
costs a huge resource leading to limited training data. Previous works create training pairs by
simulating degradation using image processing techniques. Their synthetic images are formed
with perfectly scanned photos in latent space. Even so, the real-world degradation in smartphone
photo scanning remains unsolved since it is more complicated due to real lens defocus, lighting
conditions, losing details via printing, various photo materials, and more. To solve these problems,
we propose a Deep Photo Scan (DPScan) based on semi-supervised learning. First, we present the way
to produce real-world degradation and provide the DIV2K-SCAN dataset for smartphone-scanned
photo restoration. Second, by using DIV2K-SCAN, we adopt the concept of Generative Adversarial
Networks to learn how to degrade a high-quality image as if it were scanned by a real smartphone, then
generate pseudo-scanned photos for unscanned photos. Finally, we propose to train on the scanned
and pseudo-scanned photos representing a semi-supervised approach with a cycle process as: high-quality
images --> real-/pseudo-scanned photos --> reconstructed images. The proposed semi-supervised
scheme can balance between supervised and unsupervised errors while optimizing to limit imperfect
pseudo inputs but still enhance restoration. As a result, the proposed DPScan quantitatively and
qualitatively outperforms its baseline architecture, state-of-the-art academic research,
and industrial products in smartphone photo scanning.

Unmanned aerial vehicles are rapidly evolving within the field of robotics. However, their performance
is often limited by payload capacity, operational time, and robustness to impact and collision.
These limitations of aerial vehicles become more acute for missions in challenging environments
such as subterranean structures which may require extended autonomous operation in confined spaces.
While software solutions for aerial robots are developing rapidly, improvements to hardware are
critical to applying advanced planners and algorithms in large and dangerous environments where
the short range and high susceptibility to collisions of most modern aerial robots make applications
in realistic subterranean missions infeasible. To provide such hardware capabilities, one needs
to design and implement a hardware solution that takes into the account the Size, Weight, and Power
(SWaP) constraints. This work focuses on providing a robust and versatile hybrid platform that
improves payload capacity, operation time, endurance, and versatility. The Bi-modal Aerial and
Terrestrial hybrid vehicle (BAXTER) is a solution that provides two modes of operation, aerial
and terrestrial. BAXTER employs two novel hardware mechanisms: the M-Suspension and the Decoupled
Transmission which together provide resilience during landing and crashes and efficient terrestrial
operation. Extensive flight tests were conducted to characterize the vehicle's capabilities,
including robustness and endurance. Additionally, we propose Agile Mode Transfer (AMT), a transition
from aerial to terrestrial operation that seeks to minimize impulses during impact to the ground
which is a quick and simple transition process that exploits BAXTER's resilience to impact.

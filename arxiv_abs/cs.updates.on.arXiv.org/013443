Annually the gaming industry spends approximately $15 billion in marketing reinvestment. However,
this amount is spent without any consideration for the skill and luck of the player. For a casino,
an unskilled player could fetch ~4 times more revenue than a skilled player. This paper describes
a video recognition system that is based on an extension of the Mask R-CNN model. Our system digitizes
the game of blackjack by detecting cards and player bets in real-time and processes decisions they
took in order to create accurate player personas. Our proposed supervised learning approach consists
of a specialized three-stage pipeline that takes images from two viewpoints of the casino table
and does instance segmentation to generate masks on proposed regions of interest. These predicted
masks along with derivative features are used to classify image attributes that are passed onto
the next stage to assimilate the gameplay understanding. Our end-to-end model yields an accuracy
of ~95% for the main bet detection and ~97% for card detection in a controlled environment trained
using transfer learning approach with 900 training examples. Our approach is generalizable and
scalable and shows promising results in varied gaming scenarios and test data. Such granular level
gathered data, helped in understanding player's deviation from optimum strategy and thereby separate
the skill of the player from the luck of the game. Our system also assesses the likelihood of card counting
by correlating the player's betting pattern to the deck's scaled count. Such a system lets casinos
flag fraudulent activity and calculate expected personalized profitability for each player and
tailor their marketing reinvestment decisions.

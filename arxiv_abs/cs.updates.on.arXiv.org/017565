Computational Workflows are widely used in data analysis, enabling innovation and decision-making.
In many domains (bioinformatics, image analysis, & radio astronomy) the analysis components are
numerous and written in multiple different computer languages by third parties. However, many
competing workflow systems exist, severely limiting portability of such workflows, thereby hindering
the transfer of workflows between different systems, between different projects and different
settings, leading to vendor lock-ins and limiting their generic re-usability. Here we present
the Common Workflow Language (CWL) project which produces free and open standards for describing
command-line tool based workflows. The CWL standards provide a common but reduced set of abstractions
that are both used in practice and implemented in many popular workflow systems. The CWL language
is declarative, which allows expressing computational workflows constructed from diverse software
tools, executed each through their command-line interface. Being explicit about the runtime environment
and any use of software containers enables portability and reuse. Workflows written according
to the CWL standards are a reusable description of that analysis that are runnable on a diverse set
of computing environments. These descriptions contain enough information for advanced optimization
without additional input from workflow authors. The CWL standards support polylingual workflows,
enabling portability and reuse of such workflows, easing for example scholarly publication, fulfilling
regulatory requirements, collaboration in/between academic research and industry, while reducing
implementation costs. CWL has been taken up by a wide variety of domains, and industries and support
has been implemented in many major workflow systems.

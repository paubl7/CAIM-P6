Background: Accurate diagnosis of skull base tumors is essential for providing personalized surgical
treatment strategies. Intraoperative diagnosis can be challenging due to tumor diversity and
lack of intraoperative pathology resources. Objective: To develop an independent and parallel
intraoperative pathology workflow that can provide rapid and accurate skull base tumor diagnoses
using label-free optical imaging and artificial intelligence (AI). Method: We used a fiber laser-based,
label-free, non-consumptive, high-resolution microscopy method ($<$ 60 sec per 1 $\times$ 1 mm$^\text{2}$),
called stimulated Raman histology (SRH), to image a consecutive, multicenter cohort of skull base
tumor patients. SRH images were then used to train a convolutional neural network (CNN) model using
three representation learning strategies: cross-entropy, self-supervised contrastive learning,
and supervised contrastive learning. Our trained CNN models were tested on a held-out, multicenter
SRH dataset. Results: SRH was able to image the diagnostic features of both benign and malignant
skull base tumors. Of the three representation learning strategies, supervised contrastive learning
most effectively learned the distinctive and diagnostic SRH image features for each of the skull
base tumor types. In our multicenter testing set, cross-entropy achieved an overall diagnostic
accuracy of 91.5%, self-supervised contrastive learning 83.9%, and supervised contrastive learning
96.6%. Our trained model was able to identify tumor-normal margins and detect regions of microscopic
tumor infiltration in whole-slide SRH images. Conclusion: SRH with AI models trained using contrastive
representation learning can provide rapid and accurate intraoperative diagnosis of skull base
tumors.

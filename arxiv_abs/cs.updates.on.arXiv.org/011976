With computer vision reaching an inflection point in the past decade, face recognition technology
has become pervasive in policing, intelligence gathering, and consumer applications. Recently,
face recognition technology has been deployed on bodyworn cameras to keep officers safe, enabling
situational awareness and providing evidence for trial. However, limited academic research has
been conducted on this topic using traditional techniques on datasets with small sample size. This
paper aims to bridge the gap in the state-of-the-art face recognition using bodyworn cameras (BWC).
To this aim, the contribution of this work is two-fold: (1) collection of a dataset called BWCFace
consisting of a total of 178K facial images of 132 subjects captured using the body-worn camera in
in-door and daylight conditions, and (2) open-set evaluation of the latest deep-learning-based
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures combined with five different loss functions
for face identification, on the collected dataset. Experimental results on our BWCFace dataset
suggest a maximum of 33.89% Rank-1 accuracy obtained when facial features are extracted using SENet-50
trained on a large scale VGGFace2 facial image dataset. However, performance improved up to a maximum
of 99.00% Rank-1 accuracy when pretrained CNN models are fine-tuned on a subset of identities in
our BWCFace dataset. Equivalent performances were obtained across body-worn camera sensor models
used in existing face datasets. The collected BWCFace dataset and the pretrained/ fine-tuned algorithms
are publicly available to promote further research and development in this area. A downloadable

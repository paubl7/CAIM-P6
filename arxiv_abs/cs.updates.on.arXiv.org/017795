Physical photographs now can be conveniently scanned by smartphones and stored forever as a digital
version, yet the scanned photos are not restored well. One solution is to train a supervised deep
neural network on many digital photos and the corresponding scanned photos. However, it requires
a high labor cost, leading to limited training data. Previous works create training pairs by simulating
degradation using image processing techniques. Their synthetic images are formed with perfectly
scanned photos in latent space. Even so, the real-world degradation in smartphone photo scanning
remains unsolved since it is more complicated due to lens defocus, lighting conditions, losing
details via printing. Besides, locally structural misalignment still occurs in data due to distorted
shapes captured in a 3-D world, reducing restoration performance and the reliability of the quantitative
evaluation. To solve these problems, we propose a semi-supervised Deep Photo Scan (DPScan). First,
we present a way of producing real-world degradation and provide the DIV2K-SCAN dataset for smartphone-scanned
photo restoration. Also, Local Alignment is proposed to reduce the minor misalignment remaining
in data. Second, we simulate many different variants of the real-world degradation using low-level
image transformation to gain a generalization in smartphone-scanned image properties, then train
a degradation network to generalize all styles of degradation and provide pseudo-scanned photos
for unscanned images as if they were scanned by a smartphone. Finally, we propose a Semi-Supervised
Learning that allows our restoration network to be trained on both scanned and unscanned images,
diversifying training image content. As a result, the proposed DPScan quantitatively and qualitatively
outperforms its baseline architecture, state-of-the-art academic research, and industrial
products in smartphone photo scanning.

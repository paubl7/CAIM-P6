Tracking locations is practical and speditive with smartphones, as they are omnipresent devices,
relatively cheap, and have the necessary sensors for positioning and networking integrated in
the same box. Nowadays recent models have GNSS antennas capable of receiving multiple constellations.
In the proposed work we test the hypothesis that GNSS positions directly recorded by smartphones
can be a valid solution for spatial analysis of people's behaviour in an urban garden. Particular
behaviours can be linked to therapeutic spots that promote health and well-being of visitors. Three
parts are reported: (i) assessment of the accuracy of the positions relative to a reference track,
(ii) implementation of a framework for automating transmission and processing of the location
information, (iii) analysis of preferred spots via spatial analytics. Different devices were
used to survey at different times and with different methods, i.e. in the pocket of the owner or on
a rigid frame. Accuracy was estimated using distance of each located point to the reference track,
and precision was estimated with static multiple measures. A chat-bot through the Telegram application
was implemented to allow users to send their data to a centralized computing environment thus automating
the spatial analysis. Results report a horizontal accuracy below ~2.3 m at 95% confidence level,
without significant difference between surveys, and very little differences between devices.
GNSS-only and assisted navigation with telephone cells also did not show significant difference.
Autocorrelation of the residuals over time and space showed strong consistency of the residuals,
thus proving a valid solution for spatial analysis of walking behaviour.

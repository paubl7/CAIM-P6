With the consolidation of deep learning in drug discovery, several novel algorithms for learning
molecular representations have been proposed. Despite the interest of the community in developing
new methods for learning molecular embeddings and their theoretical benefits, comparing molecular
embeddings with each other and with traditional representations is not straightforward, which
in turn hinders the process of choosing a suitable representation for QSAR modeling. A reason behind
this issue is the difficulty of conducting a fair and thorough comparison of the different existing
embedding approaches, which requires numerous experiments on various datasets and training scenarios.
To close this gap, we reviewed the literature on methods for molecular embeddings and reproduced
three unsupervised and two supervised molecular embedding techniques recently proposed in the
literature. We compared these five methods concerning their performance in QSAR scenarios using
different classification and regression datasets. We also compared these representations to
traditional molecular representations, namely molecular descriptors and fingerprints. As opposed
to the expected outcome, our experimental setup consisting of over 25,000 trained models and statistical
tests revealed that the predictive performance using molecular embeddings did not significantly
surpass that of traditional representations. While supervised embeddings yielded competitive
results compared to those using traditional molecular representations, unsupervised embeddings
tended to perform worse than traditional representations. Our results highlight the need for conducting
a careful comparison and analysis of the different embedding techniques prior to using them in drug
design tasks, and motivate a discussion about the potential of molecular embeddings in computer-aided
drug design.

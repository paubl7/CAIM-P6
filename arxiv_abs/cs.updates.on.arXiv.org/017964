Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) technology is a promising solution for providing high-quality mobile
services to ground users, where a UAV with limited service coverage travels among multiple geographical
user locations (e.g., hotspots) for servicing their demands locally. How to dynamically determine
a UAV swarm's cooperative path planning to best meet many users' spatio-temporally distributed
demands is an important question but is unaddressed in the literature. To our best knowledge, this
paper is the first to design and analyze cooperative path planning algorithms of a large UAV swarm
for optimally servicing many spatial locations, where ground users' demands are released dynamically
in the long time horizon. Regarding a single UAV's path planning design, we manage to substantially
simplify the traditional dynamic program and propose an optimal algorithm of low computation complexity,
which is only polynomial with respect to both the numbers of spatial locations and user demands.
After coordinating a large number $K$ of UAVs, this simplified dynamic optimization problem becomes
intractable and we alternatively present a fast iterative cooperation algorithm with provable
approximation ratio $1-(1-\frac{1}{K})^{K}$ in the worst case, which is proved to obviously outperform
the traditional approach of partitioning UAVs to serve different location clusters separately.
To relax UAVs' battery capacity limit for sustainable service provisioning, we further allow UAVs
to travel to charging stations in the mean time and thus jointly design UAVs' path planning over users'
locations and charging stations. Despite of the problem difficulty, for the optimal solution,
we successfully transform the problem to an integer linear program by creating novel directed acyclic
graph of the UAV-state transition diagram, and propose an iterative algorithm with constant approximation
ratio.

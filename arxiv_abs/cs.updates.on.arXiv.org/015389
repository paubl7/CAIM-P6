3D delineation of anatomical structures is a cardinal goal in medical imaging analysis. Prior to
deep learning, statistical shape models that imposed anatomical constraints and produced high
quality surfaces were a core technology. Prior to deep learning, statistical shape models that
imposed anatomical constraints and produced high quality surfaces were a core technology. Today
fully-convolutional networks (FCNs), while dominant, do not offer these capabilities. We present
deep implicit statistical shape models (DISSMs), a new approach to delineation that marries the
representation power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the robustness of SSMs. DISSMs
use a deep implicit surface representation to produce a compact and descriptive shape latent space
that permits statistical models of anatomical variance. To reliably fit anatomically plausible
shapes to an image, we introduce a novel rigid and non-rigid pose estimation pipeline that is modelled
as a Markov decision process(MDP). We outline a training regime that includes inverted episodic
training and a deep realization of marginal space learning (MSL). Intra-dataset experiments on
the task of pathological liver segmentation demonstrate that DISSMs can perform more robustly
than three leading FCN models, including nnU-Net: reducing the mean Hausdorff distance (HD) by
7.7-14.3mm and improving the worst case Dice-Sorensen coefficient (DSC) by 1.2-2.3%. More critically,
cross-dataset experiments on a dataset directly reflecting clinical deployment scenarios demonstrate
that DISSMs improve the mean DSC and HD by 3.5-5.9% and 12.3-24.5mm, respectively, and the worst-case
DSC by 5.4-7.3%. These improvements are over and above any benefits from representing delineations
with high-quality surface.

Addendum: The generalized Box-M\"uller algorithm provides a methodology for generating q-Gaussian
random variates. The parameter $-\infty<q\leq3$ is related to the shape of the tail decay; $q<1$
for compact-support including parabola $(q=0)$; $1<q\leq3$ for heavy-tail including Cauchy
$(q=2)$. This addendum clarifies the transformation $q'=((3q-1)/(q+1))$ within the algorithm
is due to a difference in the dimensions d of the generalized logarithm and the generalized distribution.
The transformation is clarified by the decomposition of $q=1+2\kappa/(1+d\kappa)$, where the
shape parameter $-1<\kappa\leq\infty$ quantifies the magnitude of the deformation from exponential.
A simpler specification for the generalized Box- M\"uller algorithm is provided using the shape
of the tail decay. Original: The q-Gaussian distribution is known to be an attractor of certain correlated
systems, and is the distribution which, under appropriate constraints, maximizes the entropy
Sq, basis of nonextensive statistical mechanics. This theory is postulated as a natural extension
of the standard (Boltzmann-Gibbs) statistical mechanics, and may explain the ubiquitous appearance
of heavy-tailed distributions in both natural and man-made systems. The q-Gaussian distribution
is also used as a numerical tool, for example as a visiting distribution in Generalized Simulated
Annealing. We develop and present a simple, easy to implement numerical method for generating random
deviates from a q-Gaussian distribution based upon a generalization of the well known Box-Muller
method. Our method is suitable for a larger range of q values, q<3, than has previously appeared in
the literature, and can generate deviates from q-Gaussian distributions of arbitrary width and
center. MATLAB code showing a straightforward implementation is also included.

The sequential fully implicit (SFI) scheme was introduced (Jenny et al. 2006) for solving coupled
flow and transport problems. Each time step for SFI consists of an outer loop, in which there are inner
Newton loops to implicitly and sequentially solve the pressure and transport sub-problems. In
standard SFI, the sub-problems are usually solved with tight tolerances at every outer iteration.
This can result in wasted computations that contribute little progress towards the coupled solution.
The issue is known as `over-solving'. Our objective is to minimize the cost of inner solvers while
maintaining the convergence rate of SFI. We first extended a nonlinear-acceleration (NA) framework
(Jiang and Tchelepi 2019) to multi-component compositional models, for ensuring robust outer-loop
convergence. We then developed inexact-type methods that alleviate `over-solving'. It is found
that there is no need for one sub-problem to strive for perfection, while the coupled (outer) residual
remains high due to the other sub-problem. The new SFI solver was tested using several complex cases.
The problems involve multi-phase and EoS-based compositional fluid systems. We compared different
strategies such as fixed relaxations on absolute and relative tolerances for the inner solvers,
as well as an adaptive approach. The results show that the basic SFI method is quite inefficient.
Away from a coupled solution, additional accuracy achieved in inner solvers is wasted, contributing
to little or no reduction of the overall outer residual. By comparison, the adaptive inexact method
provides relative tolerances adequate for the current convergence state of the sub-problems.
We show across a wide range of flow conditions that the new solver can effectively resolve the over-solving
issue, and thus greatly improve the overall efficiency.

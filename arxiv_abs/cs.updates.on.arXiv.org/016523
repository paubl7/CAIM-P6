Suitable composable data center networks (DCNs) are essential to support the disaggregation of
compute components in highly efficient next generation data centers (DCs). However, designing
such composable DCNs can be challenging. A composable DCN that adopts a full mesh backplane between
disaggregated compute components within a rack and employs dedicated interfaces on each point-to-point
link is wasteful and expensive. In this paper, we propose and describe two (i.e., electrical, and
electrical-optical) variants of a network for composable DC (NetCoD). NetCoD adopts a targeted
design to reduce the number of transceivers required when a mesh physical backplane is deployed
between disaggregated compute components in the same rack. The targeted design leverages optical
communication techniques and components to achieve this with minimal or no network performance
degradation. We formulate a MILP model to evaluate the performance of both variants of NetCoD in
rack-scale composable DCs that implement different forms of disaggregation. The electrical-optical
variant of NetCoD achieves similar performance as a reference network while utilizing fewer transceivers
per compute node. The targeted adoption of optical technologies by both variants of NetCoD achieves
greater (4 - 5 times greater) utilization of available network throughput than the reference network
which implements a generic design. Under the various forms of disaggregation considered, both
variant of NetCoD achieve near-optimal compute energy efficiency in the composable DC while satisfying
both compute and network constraints. This is because marginal concession of optimal compute energy
efficiency is often required to achieve overall optimal energy efficiency in composable DCs.

In this study, we address three important challenges related to the COVID-19 pandemic, namely,
(a) providing an early warning to likely exposed individuals, (b) identifying asymptomatic individuals,
and (c) prescription of optimal testing when testing capacity is limited. First, we present a dynamic-graph
based SEIR epidemiological model in order to describe the dynamics of the disease transmission.
Our model considers a dynamic graph/network that accounts for the interactions between individuals
over time, such as the ones obtained by manual or automated contact tracing, and uses a diffusion-reaction
mechanism to describe the state dynamics. This dynamic graph model helps identify likely exposed/infected
individuals to whom we can provide early warnings, even before they display any symptoms. When COVID-19
testing capacity is limited compared to the population size, reliable estimation of individual's
health state and disease transmissibility using epidemiological models is extremely challenging.
Thus, estimation of state uncertainty is paramount for both eminent risk assessment, as well as
for closing the tracing-testing loop by optimal testing prescription. Therefore, we propose the
use of arbitrary Polynomial Chaos Expansion, a popular technique used for uncertainty quantification,
to represent the states, and quantify the uncertainties in the dynamic model. This design enables
us to assign uncertainty of the state of each individual, and consequently optimize the testing
as to reduce the overall uncertainty given a constrained testing budget. We present a few simulation
results that illustrate the performance of the proposed framework, and estimate the impact of incomplete
contact tracing data.

The well-known secretary problem in sequential analysis and optimal stopping theory asks one to
maximize the probability of finding the optimal candidate in a sequentially examined list under
the constraint that accept/reject decisions are made in real-time. The problem has received significant
interest in the mathematics community and is related to practical questions arising in online search,
data streaming, daily purchase modeling and multi-arm bandit mechanisms. A version of the problem
is the so-called postdoc problem, for which the question of interest is to devise a strategy that
identifies the second-best candidate with highest possible probability of success. We solve the
postdoc problem for the untraditional setting where the candidates are not presented uniformly
at random but rather according to permutations drawn from the Mallows distribution. The Mallows
distribution represents the counterpart of a Gaussian distribution for rankings. To address the
problem, we extend the work in [1] for the secretary setting and introduce a number of new proof techniques.
Our results reveal that the optimal stopping criteria depends on the choice of the Mallows model
parameter t: For t>1, the optimal strategy is to reject the first k'(t) candidates and then accept
the next left-to-right (abbreviated as l-r) second-best candidate. This coincides with the optimal
strategy for the classical postdoc problem derived in [3,2]. For 0<t<=1/2, the optimal strategy
is to reject the first k"(t) candidates and then accept the next l-r best candidate; if no selection
is made before the last candidate, then the last candidate is accepted. The most interesting strategy
arises for 1/2<t<1, the optimal strategy is to reject the first k_1(t) candidates and then accept
the next l-r maximum, or reject the first k_2(t)>=k_1(t) candidates and then accept the next l-r
second maximum, whichever comes first.

State-of-the-art motorized hand prostheses are endowed with actuators able to provide independent
and proportional control of as many as six degrees of freedom (DOFs). The control signals are derived
from residual electromyographic (EMG) activity, recorded concurrently from relevant forearm
muscles. Nevertheless, the functional mapping between forearm EMG activity and hand kinematics
is only known with limited accuracy. Therefore, no robust method exists for the reliable computation
of control signals for the independent and proportional actuation of more than two DOFs. A common
approach to deal with this limitation is to pre-program the prostheses for the execution of a restricted
number of behaviors (e.g., pinching, grasping, and wrist rotation) that are activated by the detection
of specific EMG activation patterns. However, this approach severely limits the range of activities
users can perform with the prostheses during their daily living. In this work, we introduce a novel
method, based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to continuously map forearm EMG activity
onto hand kinematics. Critically, unlike previous work, which often focuses on simple and highly
controlled motor tasks, we tested our method on a dataset of activities of daily living (ADLs): the
KIN-MUS UJI dataset. To the best of our knowledge, ours is the first reported work on the prediction
of hand kinematics that uses this challenging dataset. Remarkably, we show that our network is able
to generalize to novel untrained ADLs. Our results suggest that the presented method is suitable
for the generation of control signals for the independent and proportional actuation of the multiple
DOFs of state-of-the-art hand prostheses.

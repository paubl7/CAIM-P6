Extreme Learning Machine is a powerful classification method very competitive existing classification
methods. It is extremely fast at training. Nevertheless, it cannot perform face verification tasks
properly because face verification tasks require comparison of facial images of two individuals
at the same time and decide whether the two faces identify the same person. The structure of Extreme
Leaning Machine was not designed to feed two input data streams simultaneously, thus, in 2-input
scenarios Extreme Learning Machine methods are normally applied using concatenated inputs. However,
this setup consumes two times more computational resources and it is not optimized for recognition
tasks where learning a separable distance metric is critical. For these reasons, we propose and
develop a Siamese Extreme Learning Machine (SELM). SELM was designed to be fed with two data streams
in parallel simultaneously. It utilizes a dual-stream Siamese condition in the extra Siamese layer
to transform the data before passing it along to the hidden layer. Moreover, we propose a Gender-Ethnicity-Dependent
triplet feature exclusively trained on a variety of specific demographic groups. This feature
enables learning and extracting of useful facial features of each group. Experiments were conducted
to evaluate and compare the performances of SELM, Extreme Learning Machine, and DCNN. The experimental
results showed that the proposed feature was able to perform correct classification at 97.87% accuracy
and 99.45% AUC. They also showed that using SELM in conjunction with the proposed feature provided
98.31% accuracy and 99.72% AUC. They outperformed the well-known DCNN and Extreme Leaning Machine
methods by a wide margin.

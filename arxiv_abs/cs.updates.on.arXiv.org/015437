In order to optimally design materials, it is crucial to understand the structure-property relations
in the material by analyzing the effect of microstructure parameters on the macroscopic properties.
In computational homogenization, the microstructure is thus explicitly modeled inside the macrostructure,
leading to a coupled two-scale formulation. Unfortunately, the high computational costs of such
multiscale simulations often render the solution of design, optimization, or inverse problems
infeasible. To address this issue, we propose in this work a non-intrusive reduced basis method
to construct inexpensive surrogates for parametrized microscale problems; the method is specifically
well-suited for multiscale simulations since the coupled simulation is decoupled into two independent
problems: (1) solving the microscopic problem for different (loading or material) parameters
and learning a surrogate model from the data; and (2) solving the macroscopic problem with the learned
material model. The proposed method has three key features. First, the microscopic stress field
can be fully recovered. Second, the method is able to accurately predict the stress field for a wide
range of material parameters; furthermore, the derivatives of the effective stress with respect
to the material parameters are available and can be readily utilized in solving optimization problems.
Finally, it is more data efficient, i.e. requiring less training data, as compared to directly performing
a regression on the effective stress. For the microstructures in the two test problems considered,
the mean approximation error of the effective stress is as low as 0.1% despite using a relatively
small training dataset. Embedded into the macroscopic problem, the reduced order model leads to
an online speed up of approximately three orders of magnitude while maintaining a high accuracy
as compared to the FE$^2$ solver.

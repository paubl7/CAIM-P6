Models related to the Euler's elastica energy have proven to be useful for many applications including
image processing. Extending elastica models to color images and multi-channel data is a challenging
task, as stable and consistent numerical solvers for these geometric models often involve high
order derivatives. Like the single channel Euler's elastica model and the total variation (TV)
models, geometric measures that involve high order derivatives could help when considering image
formation models that minimize elastic properties. In the past, the Polyakov action from high energy
physics has been successfully applied to color image processing. Here, we introduce an addition
to the Polyakov action for color images that minimizes the color manifold curvature. The color image
curvature is computed by applying of the Laplace-Beltrami operator to the color image channels.
When reduced to gray-scale images, while selecting appropriate scaling between space and color,
the proposed model minimizes the Euler's elastica operating on the image level sets. Finding a minimizer
for the proposed nonlinear geometric model is a challenge we address in this paper. Specifically,
we present an operator-splitting method to minimize the proposed functional. The non-linearity
is decoupled by introducing three vector-valued and matrix-valued variables. The problem is then
converted into solving for the steady state of an associated initial-value problem. The initial-value
problem is time-split into three fractional steps, such that each sub-problem has a closed form
solution, or can be solved by fast algorithms. The efficiency and robustness of the proposed method
are demonstrated by systematic numerical experiments.

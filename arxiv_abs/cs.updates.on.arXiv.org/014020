In this paper we give fast distributed graph algorithms for detecting and listing small subgraphs,
and for computing or approximating the girth. Our algorithms improve upon the state of the art by
polynomial factors, and for girth, we obtain an constant-time algorithm for additive +1 approximation
in the Congested Clique, and the first parametrized algorithm for exact computation in CONGEST.
In the Congested Clique, we develop a technique for learning small neighborhoods, and apply it to
obtain an $O(1)$-round algorithm that computes the girth with only an additive +1 error. Next, we
introduce a new technique (the partition tree technique) allowing for efficiently and deterministically
listing all copies of any subgraph, improving upon the state-of the-art for non-dense graphs. We
give two applications of this technique: First we show that for constant $k$, $C_{2k}$-detection
can be solved in $O(1)$ rounds in the Congested Clique, improving on prior work which used matrix
multiplication and had polynomial round complexity. Second, we show that in triangle-free graphs,
the girth can be exactly computed in time polynomially faster than the best known bounds for general
graphs. In CONGEST, we describe a new approach for finding cycles, and apply it in two ways: first
we show a fast parametrized algorithm for girth with round complexity $\tilde{O}(\min(g\cdot
n^{1-1/\Theta(g)},n))$ for any girth $g$; and second, we show how to find small even-length cycles
$C_{2k}$ for $k = 3,4,5$ in $O(n^{1-1/k})$ rounds, which is a polynomial improvement upon the previous
running times. Finally, using our improved $C_6$-freeness algorithm and the barrier on proving
lower bounds on triangle-freeness of Eden et al., we show that improving the current $\tilde\Omega(\sqrt{n})$
lower bound for $C_6$-freeness of Korhonen et al. by any polynomial factor would imply strong circuit
complexity lower bounds.

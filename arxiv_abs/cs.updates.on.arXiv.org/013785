Computing devices are vital to all areas of modern life and permeate every aspect of our society.
The ubiquity of computing and our reliance on it has been accelerated and amplified by the COVID-19
pandemic. From education to work environments to healthcare to defense to entertainment - it is
hard to imagine a segment of modern life that is not touched by computing. The security of computers,
systems, and applications has been an active area of research in computer science for decades. However,
with the confluence of both the scale of interconnected systems and increased adoption of artificial
intelligence, there are many research challenges the community must face so that our society can
continue to benefit and risks are minimized, not multiplied. Those challenges range from security
and trust of the information ecosystem to adversarial artificial intelligence and machine learning.
Along with basic research challenges, more often than not, securing a system happens after the design
or even deployment, meaning the security community is routinely playing catch-up and attempting
to patch vulnerabilities that could be exploited any minute. While security measures such as encryption
and authentication have been widely adopted, questions of security tend to be secondary to application
capability. There needs to be a sea-change in the way we approach this critically important aspect
of the problem: new incentives and education are at the core of this change. Now is the time to refocus
research community efforts on developing interconnected technologies with security "baked in
by design" and creating an ecosystem that ensures adoption of promising research developments.
To realize this vision, two additional elements of the ecosystem are necessary - proper incentive
structures for adoption and an educated citizenry that is well versed in vulnerabilities and risks.

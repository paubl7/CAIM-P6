The Database field is undergoing significant changes. Although relational systems are still predominant,
the interest in NoSQL systems is continuously increasing. In this scenario, polyglot persistence
is envisioned as the database architecture to be prevalent in the future. Multi-model database
tools normally use a generic or unified metamodel to represent schemas of the data model that they
support. Such metamodels facilitate developing utilities, as they can be built on a common representation.
Also, the number of mappings required to migrate databases from a data model to another is reduced,
and integrability is favored. In this paper, we present the U-Schema unified metamodel able to represent
logical schemas for the four most popular NoSQL paradigms (columnar, document, key-value, and
graph) as well as relational schemas. We will formally define the mappings between U-Schema and
the data model defined for each paradigm. How these mappings have been implemented and validated
will be discussed, and some applications of U-Schema will be shown. To achieve flexibility to respond
to data changes, most of NoSQL systems are "schema-on-write," and the declaration of schemas is
not required. Such an absence of schema declaration makes structural variability possible, i.e.,
stored data of the same entity type can have different structure. Moreover, data relationships
supported by each data model are different. We will show how all these issues have been tackled in
our approach. Our metamodel goes beyond the existing proposals by distinguishing entity types
and relationship types, representing aggregation and reference relationships, and including
the notion of structural variability. Our contributions also include developing schema extraction
strategies for schemaless systems of each NoSQL data model, and tackling performance and scalability
in the implementation for each store.

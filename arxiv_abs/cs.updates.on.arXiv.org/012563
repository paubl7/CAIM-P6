Deep learning had a remarkable impact in different scientific disciplines during the last years.
This was demonstrated in numerous tasks, where deep learning algorithms were able to outperform
the state-of-art methods, also in image processing and analysis. Moreover, deep learning delivers
good results in tasks like autonomous driving, which could not have been performed automatically
before. There are even applications where deep learning outperformed humans, like object recognition
or games. Another field in which this development is showing a huge potential is the medical domain.
With the collection of large quantities of patient records and data, and a trend towards personalized
treatments, there is a great need for an automatic and reliable processing and analysis of this information.
Patient data is not only collected in clinical centres, like hospitals, but it relates also to data
coming from general practitioners, healthcare smartphone apps or online websites, just to name
a few. This trend resulted in new, massive research efforts during the last years. In Q2/2020, the
search engine PubMed returns already over 11.000 results for the search term $'$deep learning$'$,
and around 90% of these publications are from the last three years. Hence, a complete overview of
the field of $'$medical deep learning$'$ is almost impossible to obtain and getting a full overview
of medical sub-fields gets increasingly more difficult. Nevertheless, several review and survey
articles about medical deep learning have been presented within the last years. They focused, in
general, on specific medical scenarios, like the analysis of medical images containing specific
pathologies. With these surveys as foundation, the aim of this contribution is to provide a very
first high-level, systematic meta-review of medical deep learning surveys.

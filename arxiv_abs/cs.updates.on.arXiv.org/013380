Understanding real-world networks has been a core research endeavor throughout the last two decades.
Network Creation Games are a promising approach for this from a game-theoretic perspective. In
these games, selfish agents corresponding to nodes in a network strategically decide which links
to form to optimize their centrality. Many versions have been introduced and analyzed, but none
of them fits to modeling the evolution of social networks. In real-world social networks, connections
are often established by recommendations from common acquaintances or by a chain of such recommendations.
Thus establishing and maintaining a contact with a friend of a friend is easier than connecting to
complete strangers. This explains the high clustering, i.e., the abundance of triangles, in real-world
social networks. We propose and analyze a network creation model inspired by real-world social
networks. Edges are formed in our model via bilateral consent of both endpoints and the cost for establishing
and maintaining an edge is proportional to the distance of the endpoints before establishing the
connection. We provide results for generic cost functions, which essentially only must be convex
functions in the distance of the endpoints without the respective edge. For this broad class of cost
functions, we provide many structural properties of equilibrium networks and prove (almost) tight
bounds on the diameter, the Price of Anarchy and the Price of Stability. Moreover, as a proof-of-concept
we show via experiments that the created equilibrium networks of our model indeed closely mimics
real-world social networks. We observe degree distributions that seem to follow a power-law, high
clustering, and low diameters. This can be seen as a promising first step towards game-theoretic
network creation models that predict networks featuring all core real-world properties.

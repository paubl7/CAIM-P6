Face recognition is one of the most fundamental and long-standing topics in computer vision community.
With the recent developments of deep convolutional neural networks and large-scale datasets,
deep face recognition has made remarkable progress and been widely used in the real-world applications.
Given a natural image or video frame as input, an end-to-end deep face recognition system outputs
the face feature for recognition. To achieve this, the whole system is generally built with three
key elements: face detection, face alignment, and face representation. The face detection locates
faces in the image or frame. Then, the face alignment is proceeded to calibrate the faces to a canonical
view and crop them to a normalized pixel size. Finally, in the stage of face representation, the discriminative
features are extracted from the preprocessed faces for recognition. All of the three elements are
fulfilled by deep convolutional neural networks. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey
about the recent advances of every element of the end-to-end deep face recognition, since the thriving
deep learning techniques have greatly improved the capability of them. To start with, we introduce
an overview of the end-to-end deep face recognition, which, as mentioned above, includes face detection,
face alignment, and face representation. Then, we review the deep learning based advances of each
element, respectively, covering many aspects such as the up-to-date algorithm designs, evaluation
metrics, datasets, performance comparison, existing challenges, and promising directions for
future research. We hope this survey could bring helpful thoughts to one for better understanding
of the big picture of end-to-end face recognition and deeper exploration in a systematic way.

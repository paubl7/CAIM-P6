Team semantics is the mathematical basis of modern logics of dependence and independence. In contrast
to classical Tarski semantics, a formula is evaluated not for a single assignment of values to the
free variables, but on a set of such assignments, called a team. Team semantics is appropriate for
a purely logical understanding of dependency notions, where only the presence or absence of data
matters, but based on sets, it does not take into account multiple occurrences of data values. It
is therefore insufficient in scenarios where such multiplicities matter, in particular for reasoning
about probabilities and statistical independencies. Therefore, an extension from teams to multiteams
(i.e. multisets of assignments) has been proposed by several authors. In this paper we aim at a systematic
development of logics of dependence and independence based on multiteam semantics. We study atomic
dependency properties of finite multiteams and discuss the appropriate meaning of logical operators
to extend the atomic dependencies to full-fledged logics for reasoning about dependence properties
in a multiteam setting. We explore properties and expressive power of a wide spectrum of different
multiteam logics and compare them to logics with team semantics. We also study the relationship
of logics with multiteam semantics with existential second-order logic for a specific class of
metafinite structures. It turns out that inclusion-exclusion logic can be characterised in a precise
sense by the Presburger fragment of this logic, but for capturing independence, we need to go beyond
it and add some form of multiplication. Finally we also consider multiteams with weights in the reals
and study the expressive power of formulae by means of topological properties.

The objectives of this study are understanding the requirements of a CSA education app, identifying
the limitations of existing apps, and providing a guideline for better app design. An electronic
search across three major app stores(Google Play, Apple, and Microsoft) is conducted and the selected
apps are rated by three independent raters. Total 191 apps are found and finally, 14 apps are selected
for review based on defined inclusion and exclusion criteria. An app rating scale for CSA education
apps is devised by modifying existing scales and used to evaluate the selected 14 apps. Our rating
scale evaluates essential features, criteria, and software quality characteristics that are
necessary for CSA education apps, and determined their effectiveness for potential use as CSA education
programs for children. The internal consistency of the rating scale and the inter and intra-rater
reliability among the raters are also calculated. User comments from the app stores are collected
and analyzed to understand their expectations and views. After analyzing the feasibility of reviewed
apps, CSA app design considerations are proposed that highlight game-based teaching approaches.
Evaluation results showed that most of the reviewed apps are not suitable for being used as CSA education
programs. While a few may be able to teach children and parents individually, only the apps "Child
Abuse Prevention" (rate 3.89 out of 5) and "Orbit Rescue" (rate 3.92 out of 5) could be deemed suitable
for a school-based CSA education program. However, all those apps need to be improved both their
software qualities and CSA-specific features for being considered as potential CSA education
programs. This study provides the necessary knowledge to developers and individuals regarding
essential features and software quality characteristics for designing and developing CSA education
apps.

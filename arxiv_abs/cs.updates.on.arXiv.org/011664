Recent outbreak of COVID-19 has led a rapid global spread around the world. Many countries have implemented
timely intensive suppression to minimize the infections, but resulted in high case fatality rate
(CFR) due to critical demand of health resources. Other country-based factors such as sociocultural
issues, ageing population etc., has also influenced practical effectiveness of taking interventions
to improve morality in early phase. To better understand the relationship of these factors across
different countries with COVID-19 CFR is of primary importance to prepare for potentially second
wave of COVID-19 infections. In the paper, we propose a novel regularized multi-task learning based
factor analysis approach for quantifying country-based factors affecting CFR in early phase of
COVID-19 epidemic. We formulate the prediction of CFR progression as a ML regression problem with
observed CFR and other countries-based factors. In this formulation, all CFR related factors were
categorized into 6 sectors with 27 indicators. We proposed a hybrid feature selection method combining
filter, wrapper and tree-based models to calibrate initial factors for a preliminary feature interaction.
Then we adopted two typical single task model (Ridge and Lasso regression) and one state-of-the-art
MTFL method (fused sparse group lasso) in our formulation. The fused sparse group Lasso (FSGL) method
allows the simultaneous selection of a common set of country-based factors for multiple time points
of COVID-19 epidemic and also enables incorporating temporal smoothness of each factor over the
whole early phase period. Finally, we proposed one novel temporal voting feature selection scheme
to balance the weight instability of multiple factors in our MTFL model.

The ReLU activation function (AF) has been extensively applied in deep neural networks, in particular
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), for image classification despite its unresolved dying ReLU
problem, which poses challenges to reliable applications. This issue has obvious important implications
for critical applications, such as those in healthcare. Recent approaches are just proposing variations
of the activation function within the same unresolved dying ReLU challenge. This contribution
reports a different research direction by investigating the development of an innovative quantum
approach to the ReLU AF that avoids the dying ReLU problem by disruptive design. The Leaky ReLU was
leveraged as a baseline on which the two quantum principles of entanglement and superposition were
applied to derive the proposed Quantum ReLU (QReLU) and the modified-QReLU (m-QReLU) activation
functions. Both QReLU and m-QReLU are implemented and made freely available in TensorFlow and Keras.
This original approach is effective and validated extensively in case studies that facilitate
the detection of COVID-19 and Parkinson Disease (PD) from medical images. The two novel AFs were
evaluated in a two-layered CNN against nine ReLU-based AFs on seven benchmark datasets, including
images of spiral drawings taken via graphic tablets from patients with Parkinson Disease and healthy
subjects, and point-of-care ultrasound images on the lungs of patients with COVID-19, those with
pneumonia and healthy controls. Despite a higher computational cost, results indicated an overall
higher classification accuracy, precision, recall and F1-score brought about by either quantum
AFs on five of the seven bench-mark datasets, thus demonstrating its potential to be the new benchmark
or gold standard AF in CNNs and aid image classification tasks involved in critical applications,
such as medical diagnoses of COVID-19 and PD.

Infant motility assessment using intelligent wearables is a promising new approach for assessment
of infant neurophysiological development, and where efficient signal analysis plays a central
role. This study investigates the use of different end-to-end neural network architectures for
processing infant motility data from wearable sensors. We focus on the performance and computational
burden of alternative sensor encoder and time-series modelling modules and their combinations.
In addition, we explore the benefits of data augmentation methods in ideal and non-ideal recording
conditions. The experiments are conducted using a data-set of multi-sensor movement recordings
from 7-month-old infants, as captured by a recently proposed smart jumpsuit for infant motility
assessment. Our results indicate that the choice of the encoder module has a major impact on classifier
performance. For sensor encoders, the best performance was obtained with parallel 2-dimensional
convolutions for intra-sensor channel fusion with shared weights for all sensors. The results
also indicate that a relatively compact feature representation is obtainable for within-sensor
feature extraction without a drastic loss to classifier performance. Comparison of time-series
models revealed that feed-forward dilated convolutions with residual and skip connections outperformed
all RNN-based models in performance, training time, and training stability. The experiments also
indicate that data augmentation improves model robustness in simulated packet loss or sensor dropout
scenarios. In particular, signal- and sensor-dropout-based augmentation strategies provided
considerable boosts to performance without negatively affecting the baseline performance. Overall
the results provide tangible suggestions on how to optimize end-to-end neural network training
for multi-channel movement sensor data.

Bayesian Networks (BNs) have become a powerful technology for reasoning under uncertainty, particularly
in areas that require causal assumptions that enable us to simulate the effect of intervention.
The graphical structure of these models can be determined by causal knowledge, learnt from data,
or a combination of both. While it seems plausible that the best approach in constructing a causal
graph involves combining knowledge with machine learning, this approach remains underused in
practice. We implement and evaluate 10 knowledge approaches with application to different case
studies and BN structure learning algorithms available in the open-source Bayesys structure learning
system. The approaches enable us to specify pre-existing knowledge that can be obtained from heterogeneous
sources, to constrain or guide structure learning. Each approach is assessed in terms of structure
learning effectiveness and efficiency, including graphical accuracy, model fitting, complexity,
and runtime; making this the first paper that provides a comparative evaluation of a wide range of
knowledge approaches for BN structure learning. Because the value of knowledge depends on what
data are available, we illustrate the results both with limited and big data. While the overall results
show that knowledge becomes less important with big data due to higher learning accuracy rendering
knowledge less important, some of the knowledge approaches are actually found to be more important
with big data. Amongst the main conclusions is the observation that reduced search space obtained
from knowledge does not always imply reduced computational complexity, perhaps because the relationships
implied by the data and knowledge are in tension.

We consider demand and supply which arise i.i.d. uniformly in the unit hypercube [0,1]^d in d dimensions,
and need to be matched with each other while minimizing the expected average distance between matched
pairs (the "cost"). We characterize the scaling behavior of the achievable cost in three models
as a function of the dimension d: (i) Static matching of N demand units with N+M supply units. (ii)
A semi-dynamic model where N+M supply units are present beforehand and N demand units arrive sequentially
and must be matched immediately. (iii) A fully dynamic model where there are always m supply units
present in the system, one supply and one demand unit arrive in each period, and the demand must be
matched immediately. We show that one can achieve nearly the same cost under the semi-dynamic model
as under the static model, despite uncertainty about the future, and that, under these two models,
d=1 is the only case where cost far exceeds distance to the nearest neighbor (which is \Theta(1/N^{1/d}))
and where adding excess supply M substantially reduces cost (by smoothing stochastic fluctuations
at larger spatial length scales). In the fully dynamic model, we show that, remarkably, for all d
we can achieve a cost only slightly more than the optimistic distance to the nearest neighbor \Theta(1/m^{1/d}).
Thus, excess supply m reduces cost in the fully dynamic model for all $d$ by reducing the distance
to the nearest neighbor. This is a fundamentally different phenomenon than that seen in the other
two models, where excess supply reduces cost while leaving the distance to the nearest neighbor
unchanged, only for d=1. Our achievability results are based on analysis of a certain "Hierarchical
Greedy" algorithm which separately handles stochastic fluctuations at different length scales.

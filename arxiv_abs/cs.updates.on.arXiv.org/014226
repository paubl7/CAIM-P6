Consider the family of bounded degree graphs in any minor-closed family (such as planar graphs).
Let d be the degree bound and n be the number of vertices of such a graph. Graphs in these classes have
hyperfinite decompositions, where, for a sufficiently small \e > 0, one removes \edn edges to get
connected components of size independent of n. An important tool for sublinear algorithms and property
testing for such classes is the partition oracle, introduced by the seminal work of Hassidim-Kelner-Nguyen-Onak
(FOCS 2009). A partition oracle is a local procedure that gives consistent access to a hyperfinite
decomposition, without any preprocessing. Given a query vertex v, the partition oracle outputs
the component containing v in time independent of n. All the answers are consistent with a single
hyperfinite decomposition. The partition oracle of Hassidim et al. runs in time d^poly(d/\e) per
query. They pose the open problem of whether poly(d/\e)-time partition oracles exist. Levi-Ron
(ICALP 2013) give a refinement of the previous approach, to get a partition oracle that runs in time
d^{\log(d/\e)-per query. In this paper, we resolve this open problem and give \poly(d/\e)-time
partition oracles for bounded degree graphs in any minor-closed family. Unlike the previous line
of work based on combinatorial methods, we employ techniques from spectral graph theory. We build
on a recent spectral graph theoretical toolkit for minor-closed graph families, introduced by
the authors to develop efficient property testers. A consequence of our result is a poly(d/\e)-query
tester for any monotone and additive property of minor-closed families (such as bipartite planar
graphs). Our result also gives poly(d/\e)-query algorithms for additive {\e}n-approximations
for problems such as maximum matching, minimum vertex cover, maximum independent set, and minimum
dominating set for these graph families.

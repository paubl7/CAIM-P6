Being a crucial task of autonomous driving, Stereo matching has made great progress in recent years.
Existing stereo matching methods estimate disparity instead of depth. They treat the disparity
errors as the evaluation metric of the depth estimation errors, since the depth can be calculated
from the disparity according to the triangulation principle. However, we find that the error of
the depth depends not only on the error of the disparity but also on the depth range of the points. Therefore,
even if the disparity error is low, the depth error is still large, especially for the distant points.
In this paper, a novel Direct Depth Learning Network (DDL-Net) is designed for stereo matching.
DDL-Net consists of two stages: the Coarse Depth Estimation stage and the Adaptive-Grained Depth
Refinement stage, which are all supervised by depth instead of disparity. Specifically, Coarse
Depth Estimation stage uniformly samples the matching candidates according to depth range to construct
cost volume and output coarse depth. Adaptive-Grained Depth Refinement stage performs further
matching near the coarse depth to correct the imprecise matching and wrong matching. To make the
Adaptive-Grained Depth Refinement stage robust to the coarse depth and adaptive to the depth range
of the points, the Granularity Uncertainty is introduced to Adaptive-Grained Depth Refinement
stage. Granularity Uncertainty adjusts the matching range and selects the candidates' features
according to coarse prediction confidence and depth range. We verify the performance of DDL-Net
on SceneFlow dataset and DrivingStereo dataset by different depth metrics. Results show that DDL-Net
achieves an average improvement of 25% on the SceneFlow dataset and $12\%$ on the DrivingStereo
dataset comparing the classical methods. More importantly, we achieve state-of-the-art accuracy
at a large distance.

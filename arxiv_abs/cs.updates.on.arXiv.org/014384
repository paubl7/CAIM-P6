We present a topology-based method for mesh-partitioning in three-dimensional discrete fracture
network (DFN) simulations that take advantage of the intrinsic multi-level nature of a DFN. DFN
models are used to simulate flow and transport through low-permeability fractured media in the
subsurface by explicitly representing fractures as discrete entities. The governing equations
for flow and transport are numerically integrated on computational meshes generated on the interconnected
fracture networks. Modern high-fidelity DFN simulations require high-performance computing
on multiple processors where performance and scalability depend partially on obtaining a high-quality
partition of the mesh to balance work-loads and minimize communication across all processors.
The discrete structure of a DFN naturally lends itself to various graph representations. We develop
two applications of the multilevel graph partitioning algorithm to partition the mesh of a DFN.
In the first, we project a partition of the graph based on the DFN topology onto the mesh of the DFN and
in the second, this projection is used as the initial condition for further partitioning refinement
of the mesh. We compare the performance of these methods with standard multi-level graph partitioning
using graph-based metrics (cut, imbalance, partitioning time), computational-based metrics
(FLOPS, iterations, solver time), and total run time. The DFN-based and the mesh-based partitioning
methods are comparable in terms of the graph-based metrics, but the time required to obtain the partition
is several orders of magnitude faster using the DFN-based partitions. In combination, these partitions
are several orders of magnitude faster than the mesh-based partition. In turn, this hybrid method
outperformed both of the other methods in terms of the total run time.

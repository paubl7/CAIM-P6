Introduction: Real-world data generated from clinical practice can be used to analyze the real-world
evidence (RWE) of COVID-19 pharmacotherapy and validate the results of randomized clinical trials
(RCTs). Machine learning (ML) methods are being used in RWE and are promising tools for precision-medicine.
In this study, ML methods are applied to study the efficacy of therapies on COVID-19 hospital admissions
in the Valencian Region in Spain. Methods: 5244 and 1312 COVID-19 hospital admissions - dated between
January 2020 and January 2021 from 10 health departments, were used respectively for training and
validation of separate treatment-effect models (TE-ML) for remdesivir, corticosteroids, tocilizumab,
lopinavir-ritonavir, azithromycin and chloroquine/hydroxychloroquine. 2390 admissions from
2 additional health departments were reserved as an independent test to analyze retrospectively
the survival benefits of therapies in the population selected by the TE-ML models using cox-proportional
hazard models. TE-ML models were adjusted using treatment propensity scores to control for pre-treatment
confounding variables associated to outcome and further evaluated for futility. ML architecture
was based on boosted decision-trees. Results: In the populations identified by the TE-ML models,
only Remdesivir and Tocilizumab were significantly associated with an increase in survival time,
with hazard ratios of 0.41 (P = 0.04) and 0.21 (P = 0.001), respectively. No survival benefits from
chloroquine derivatives, lopinavir-ritonavir and azithromycin were demonstrated. Tools to
explain the predictions of TE-ML models are explored at patient-level as potential tools for personalized
decision making and precision medicine. Conclusion: ML methods are suitable tools toward RWE analysis
of COVID-19 pharmacotherapies. Results obtained reproduce published results on RWE and validate
the results from RCTs.

Digital proximity tracing (DPT) for Sars-CoV-2 pandemic mitigation is a complex intervention
with the primary goal to notify app users about possible risk exposures to infected persons. Policymakers
and DPT operators need to know whether their system works as expected in terms of speed or yield (performance)
and whether DPT is making an effective contribution to pandemic mitigation (also in comparison
to and beyond established mitigation measures, particularly manual contact tracing). Thereby,
performance and effectiveness are not to be confused. Not only are there conceptual differences
but also diverse data requirements. This article describes differences between performance and
effectiveness measures and attempts to develop a terminology and classification system for DPT
evaluation. We discuss key aspects for critical assessments of whether the integration of additional
data measurements into DPT apps - beyond what is required to fulfill its primary notification role
- may facilitate an understanding of performance and effectiveness of planned and deployed DPT
apps. Therefore, the terminology and a classification matrix may offer some guidance to DPT system
operators regarding which measurements to prioritize. DPT developers and operators may also make
conscious decisions to integrate measures for epidemic monitoring but should be aware that this
introduces a secondary purpose to DPT that is not part of the original DPT design. Ultimately, the
integration of further information for epidemic monitoring into DPT involves a trade-off between
data granularity and linkage on the one hand, and privacy on the other. Decision-makers should be
aware of the trade-off and take it into account when planning and developing DPT notification and
monitoring systems or intending to assess the added value of DPT relative to existing contact tracing
systems.

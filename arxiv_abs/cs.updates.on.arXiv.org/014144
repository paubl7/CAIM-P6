Surveillance scenarios are prone to several problems since they usually involve low-resolution
footage, and there is no control of how far the subjects may be from the camera in the first place. This
situation is suitable for the application of upsampling (super-resolution) algorithms since
they may be able to recover the discriminant properties of the subjects involved. While general
super-resolution approaches were proposed to enhance image quality for human-level perception,
biometrics super-resolution methods seek the best "computer perception" version of the image
since their focus is on improving automatic recognition performance. Convolutional neural networks
and deep learning algorithms, in general, have been applied to computer vision tasks and are now
state-of-the-art for several sub-domains, including image classification, restoration, and
super-resolution. However, no work has evaluated the effects that the latest proposed super-resolution
methods may have upon the accuracy and face verification performance in low-resolution "in-the-wild"
data. This project aimed at evaluating and adapting different deep neural network architectures
for the task of face super-resolution driven by face recognition performance in real-world low-resolution
images. The experimental results in a real-world surveillance and attendance datasets showed
that general super-resolution architectures might enhance face verification performance of
deep neural networks trained on high-resolution faces. Also, since neural networks are function
approximators and can be trained based on specific objective functions, the use of a customized
loss function optimized for feature extraction showed promising results for recovering discriminant
features in low-resolution face images.

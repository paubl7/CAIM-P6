Flying ad hoc network (FANET) provides portable and flexible communication for many applications
and possesses several unique design challenges; a key one is the successful delivery of messages
to the destination, reliably. For reliable communication, routing plays an important role, which
establishes a path between source and destination on the basis of certain criteria. Conventional
routing protocols of FANET generally use a minimum hop count criterion to find the best route between
source and destination, which results in lower latency with the consideration that there is single
source/destination network environment. However, in a network with multiple sources, the minimum
hop count routing criterion along with the 1-Hop HELLO messages broadcasted by each node in the network
may deteriorate the network performance in terms of high End-to-End (ETE) delay and decrease in
the lifetime of the network. This research work proposes a Reliable link-adaptive position-based
routing protocol (RLPR) for FANET. It uses relative speed, signal strength, and energy of the nodes
along with the geographic distance towards the destination using a forwarding angle. This angle
is used to determine the forwarding zone that decreases the undesirable control messages in the
network in order to discover the route. RLPR enhances the network performance by selecting those
relay nodes which are in the forwarding zone and whose geographic movement is towards the destination.
Additionally, RLPR selects the next hop with better energy level and uses signal strength and relative
speed of the nodes to achieve high connectivity-level. Based on the performance evaluation performed
in the Network simulator (ns-2.35), it has been analysed that RLPR outperforms the Robust and reliable
predictive based routing (RARP) and Ad hoc on-demand distance vector (AODV) protocols in different
scenarios.

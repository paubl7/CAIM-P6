Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) leverages distributed and non-dedicated sensing concepts by utilizing
sensors imbedded in a large number of mobile smart devices. However, the openness and distributed
nature of MCS leads to various vulnerabilities and consequent challenges to address. A malicious
user submitting fake sensing tasks to an MCS platform may be attempting to consume resources from
any number of participants' devices; as well as attempting to clog the MCS server. In this paper,
a novel approach that is based on horizontal federated learning is proposed to identify fake tasks
that contain a number of independent detection devices and an aggregation entity. Detection devices
are deployed to operate in parallel with each device equipped with a machine learning (ML) module,
and an associated training dataset. Furthermore, the aggregation module collects the prediction
results from individual devices and determines the final decision with the objective of minimizing
the prediction loss. Loss measurement considers the lost task values with respect to misclassification,
where the final decision utilizes a risk-aware approach where the risk is formulated as a function
of the utility loss. Experimental results demonstrate that using federated learning-driven illegitimate
task detection with a risk aware aggregation function improves the detection performance of the
traditional centralized framework. Furthermore, the higher performance of detection and lower
loss of utility can be achieved by the proposed framework. This scheme can even achieve 100%detection
accuracy using small training datasets distributed across devices, while achieving slightly
over an 8% increase in detection improvement over traditional approaches.

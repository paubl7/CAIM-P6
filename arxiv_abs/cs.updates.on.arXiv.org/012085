All Italian consonants affected by gemination, that is affricates, fricatives, liquids, nasals,
and stops, were analyzed within a project named GEMMA that lasted over a span of about 25 years. Results
of the analysis on stops, as published in (Esposito, A., and Di Benedetto, M. G. (1999). "Acoustic
and Perceptual Study of Gemination in Italian Stops," The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America,
ASA, Vol. 30, pp. 175-185) showed that the main acoustic cue to gemination in Italian was closure
duration, while frequency and energy domain parameters were not significantly affected by gemination.
This paper - the first of a set of two covering all remaining consonants - addresses nasals and liquids;
its companion paper addresses affricates and fricatives. Results on nasals and liquids confirm
the findings on stops, in particular that the primary acoustic cue to gemination in Italian is durational
in nature and corresponds to a lengthened consonant duration. Results also show an inverse correlation
between consonant and pre-consonant vowel durations which is, however, also present when considering
singleton vs. geminate word sets separately, indicating a sort of duration compensation between
these segments to eventually preserve rhythmical structures; this inverse correlation is reinforced
when considering singleton and geminate sets combined. Classification tests of singleton vs.
geminate consonants show that, for both nasals and liquids, best classification scores are obtained
when consonant duration is used as a classification parameter. Although slightly less performing,
the ratio between consonant and pre-consonant vowel durations is also a potential good candidate
for automatic classification of geminate vs singleton nasals and liquids in Italian.

Real-time state estimation and forecasting is critical for efficient operation of power grids.
In this paper, a physics-informed Gaussian process regression (PhI-GPR) method is presented and
used for probabilistic forecasting and estimating the phase angle, angular speed, and wind mechanical
power of a three-generator power grid system using sparse measurements. In standard data-driven
Gaussian process regression (GPR), parameterized models for the prior statistics are fit by maximizing
the marginal likelihood of observed data, whereas in PhI-GPR, we compute the prior statistics by
solving stochastic equations governing power grid dynamics. The short-term forecast of a power
grid system dominated by wind generation is complicated by the stochastic nature of the wind and
the resulting uncertain mechanical wind power. Here, we assume that the power-grid dynamic is governed
by the swing equations, and we treat the unknown terms in the swing equations (specifically, the
mechanical wind power) as random processes, which turns these equations into stochastic differential
equations. We solve these equations for the mean and variance of the power grid system using the Monte
Carlo simulations method. We demonstrate that the proposed PhI-GPR method can accurately forecast
and estimate both observed and unobserved states, including the mean behavior and associated uncertainty.
For observed states, we show that PhI-GPR provides a forecast comparable to the standard data-driven
GPR, with both forecasts being significantly more accurate than the autoregressive integrated
moving average (ARIMA) forecast. We also show that the ARIMA forecast is much more sensitive to observation
frequency and measurement errors than the PhI-GPR forecast.

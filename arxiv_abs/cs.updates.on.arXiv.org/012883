Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) are more and more competitive due to their increasing performances
and decreasing costs. Although certain battery storage technologies may be mature and reliable
from a technological perspective, with further cost reductions expected, the economic concern
of battery systems is still a major barrier to be overcome before BESS can be fully utilized as a mainstream
storage solution in the energy sector. Since the investment costs for deploying BESS are significant,
one of the most crucial issues is to optimally size the battery system to balance the trade-off between
using BESS to improve energy system performance and to achieve profitable investment. Determining
the optimal BESS size for a specific application is a complex task because it relies on many factors,
depending on the application itself, on the technical characteristics of the battery system and
on the business model framework. This paper describes a generic simulation-based analytical method
which has been developed to determine the BESS optimal size by taking into account both the application
and the storage performance over its lifetime. Its implementation and the associated results are
presented for two different BESS use cases: A smoothing and peak shaving application for PV injection
and an off-grid hybrid microgrid case. In order to provide a better understanding of the most influencing
drivers to consider during a BESS sizing procedure, several sensitivity analyses have been carried
out on these two illustrative cases. The use of comparative scenarios led to quantify the degree
of impact on optimal sizing results of several factors among the following topics: control strategy,
forecast quality, degradation of battery performance due to ageing, precision of technical modelling.

Time series research has gathered lots of interests in the last decade, especially for Time Series
Classification (TSC) and Time Series Forecasting (TSF). Research in TSC has greatly benefited
from the University of California Riverside and University of East Anglia (UCR/UEA) Time Series
Archives. On the other hand, the advancement in Time Series Forecasting relies on time series forecasting
competitions such as the Makridakis competitions, NN3 and NN5 Neural Network competitions, and
a few Kaggle competitions. Each year, thousands of papers proposing new algorithms for TSC and TSF
have utilized these benchmarking archives. These algorithms are designed for these specific problems,
but may not be useful for tasks such as predicting the heart rate of a person using photoplethysmogram
(PPG) and accelerometer data. We refer to this problem as Time Series Extrinsic Regression (TSER),
where we are interested in a more general methodology of predicting a single continuous value, from
univariate or multivariate time series. This prediction can be from the same time series or not directly
related to the predictor time series and does not necessarily need to be a future value or depend heavily
on recent values. To the best of our knowledge, research into TSER has received much less attention
in the time series research community and there are no models developed for general time series extrinsic
regression problems. Most models are developed for a specific problem. Therefore, we aim to motivate
and support the research into TSER by introducing the first TSER benchmarking archive. This archive
contains 19 datasets from different domains, with varying number of dimensions, unequal length
dimensions, and missing values. In this paper, we introduce the datasets in this archive and did
an initial benchmark on existing models.

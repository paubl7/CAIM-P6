Healthcare is an essential application of e-services, where for diagnostic testing, medical imaging
acquiring, processing, analysis, storage, and protection are used. Image ciphering during storage
and transmission over the networks used has seen implemented using many types of ciphering algorithms
for security purpose. Current cyphering algorithms are classified into two types: traditional
classical cryptography using standard algorithms (DES, AES, IDEA, RC5, RSA, ...) and chaos cryptography
using continuous (Chau, Rossler, Lorenz, ...) or discreet (Logistics, Henon, ...) algorithms.
The traditional algorithms have struggled to combat image data as compared to regular textual data.
Whereas, the chaotic algorithms are more efficient for image ciphering. The Significance characteristics
of chaos are its extreme sensitivity to initial conditions and algorithm parameters. In this paper,
medical image security based on hybrid/mixed chaotic algorithms is proposed. The proposed method
is implemented using MATLAB. Where the image of the Retina of the Eye to detect Blood Vessels is ciphered.
The Pseudo-Random Numbers Generators (PRNGs) from the different chaotic algorithms are implemented,
and their statistical properties are evaluated using the National Institute of Standards and Technology
NIST and other statistical test-suits. Then, these algorithms are used to secure the data, where
the statistical properties of the cipher-text are also tested. We propose two PRNGs to increase
the complexity of the PRNGs and to allow many of the NIST statistical tests to be passed: one based
on two-hybrid mixed chaotic logistic maps and one based on two-hybrid mixed chaotic Henon maps,
where each chaotic algorithm runs side-by-side and starts with random initial conditions and parameters
(encryption keys). The resulting hybrid PRNGs passed many of the NIST statistical test suits.

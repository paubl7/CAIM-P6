Intent driven networks are an essential stepping stone in the evolution of network and service management
towards a truly autonomous paradigm. User centric intents provide an abstracted means of impacting
the design, provisioning, deployment and assurance of network infrastructure and services with
the help of service level agreements and minimum network capability exposure. The concept of Intent-based
networking (IBN) poses several challenges in terms of the contextual definition of intents, role
of different stakeholders, and a generalized architecture. In this review, we provide a comprehensive
analysis of the state-of-the-art in IBN including the intent description models, intent lifecycle
management, significance of IBN and a generalized architectural framework along with challenges
and prospects for IBN in future networks. An analytical study is performed on the data collected
from relevant studies primarily focusing on the inter-working of IBN with softwarized networking
based on NFV/SDN infrastructures. Critical functions required in the IBN management and service
model design are explored with different abstract modeling techniques and a converged architectural
framework is proposed. The key findings include: 1) benefits and role of IBN in autonomous networking,
2) improvements needed to integrate intents as fundamental policies for service modeling and network
management, 3) need for appropriate representation models for intents in domain agnostic abstract
manner, and 4) need to include learning as a fundamental function in autonomous networks. These
observations provide the basis for in-depth investigation and standardization efforts for IBN
as a fundamental network management paradigm in beyond 5G networks.

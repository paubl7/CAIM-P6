Deciding what's next? is a fundamental problem in robotics and Artificial Intelligence. Under
belief space planning (BSP), in a partially observable setting, it involves calculating the expected
accumulated belief-dependent reward, where the expectation is with respect to all future measurements.
Since solving this general un-approximated problem quickly becomes intractable, state of the
art approaches turn to approximations while still calculating planning sessions from scratch.
In this work we propose a novel paradigm, Incremental BSP (iX-BSP), based on the key insight that
calculations across planning sessions are similar in nature and can be appropriately re-used.
We calculate the expectation incrementally by utilizing Multiple Importance Sampling techniques
for selective re-sampling and re-use of measurement from previous planning sessions. The formulation
of our approach considers general distributions and accounts for data association aspects. We
demonstrate how iX-BSP could benefit existing approximations of the general problem, introducing
iML-BSP, which re-uses calculations across planning sessions under the common Maximum Likelihood
assumption. We evaluate both methods and demonstrate a substantial reduction in computation time
while statistically preserving accuracy. The evaluation includes both simulation and real-world
experiments considering autonomous vision-based navigation and SLAM. As a further contribution,
we introduce to iX-BSP the non-integral wildfire approximation, allowing one to trade accuracy
for computational performance by averting from updating re-used beliefs when they are "close enough".
We evaluate iX-BSP under wildfire demonstrating a substantial reduction in computation time while
controlling the accuracy sacrifice. We also provide analytical and empirical bounds of the effect
wildfire holds over the objective value.

Climate change is global, yet its concrete impacts can strongly vary between different locations
in the same region. Seasonal weather forecasts currently operate at the mesoscale (> 1 km). For more
targeted mitigation and adaptation, modelling impacts to < 100 m is needed. Yet, the relationship
between driving variables and Earth's surface at such local scales remains unresolved by current
physical models. Large Earth observation datasets now enable us to create machine learning models
capable of translating coarse weather information into high-resolution Earth surface forecasts.
Here, we define high-resolution Earth surface forecasting as video prediction of satellite imagery
conditional on mesoscale weather forecasts. Video prediction has been tackled with deep learning
models. Developing such models requires analysis-ready datasets. We introduce EarthNet2021,
a new, curated dataset containing target spatio-temporal Sentinel 2 satellite imagery at 20 m resolution,
matched with high-resolution topography and mesoscale (1.28 km) weather variables. With over
32000 samples it is suitable for training deep neural networks. Comparing multiple Earth surface
forecasts is not trivial. Hence, we define the EarthNetScore, a novel ranking criterion for models
forecasting Earth surface reflectance. For model intercomparison we frame EarthNet2021 as a challenge
with four tracks based on different test sets. These allow evaluation of model validity and robustness
as well as model applicability to extreme events and the complete annual vegetation cycle. In addition
to forecasting directly observable weather impacts through satellite-derived vegetation indices,
capable Earth surface models will enable downstream applications such as crop yield prediction,
forest health assessments, coastline management, or biodiversity monitoring. Find data, code,

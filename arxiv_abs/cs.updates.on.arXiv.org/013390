In this paper we explain a process of super-resolution reconstruction allowing to increase the
resolution of an image.The need for high-resolution digital images exists in diverse domains,
for example the medical and spatial domains. The obtaining of high-resolution digital images can
be made at the time of the shooting, but it is often synonymic of important costs because of the necessary
material to avoid such costs, it is known how to use methods of super-resolution reconstruction,
consisting from one or several low resolution images to obtain a high-resolution image. The american
patent US 9208537 describes such an algorithm. A zone of one low-resolution image is isolated and
categorized according to the information contained in pixels forming the borders of the zone. The
category of it zone determines the type of interpolation used to add pixels in aforementioned zone,
to increase the neatness of the images. It is also known how to reconstruct a low-resolution image
there high-resolution image by using a model of super-resolution reconstruction whose learning
is based on networks of neurons and on image or a picture library. The demand of chinese patent CN 107563965
and the scientist publication "Pixel Recursive Super Resolution", R. Dahl, M. Norouzi, J. Shlens
propose such methods. The aim of this paper is to demonstrate that it is possible to reconstruct coherent
human faces from very degraded pixelated images with a very fast algorithm, more faster than compressed
sensing (CS), easier to compute and without deep learning, so without important technology resources,
i.e. a large database of thousands training images (see arXiv:2003.13063). This technological
breakthrough has been patented in 2018 with the demand of French patent FR 1855485 (https://patents.google.com/patent/FR3082980A1,

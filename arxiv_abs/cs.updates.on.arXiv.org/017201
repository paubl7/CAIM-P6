This article is devoted to the construction of a new class of semi-Lagrangian (SL) schemes with implicit-explicit
(IMEX) Runge-Kutta (RK) time stepping for PDEs involving multiple space-time scales. The semi-Lagrangian
(SL) approach fully couples the space and time discretization, thus making the use of RK strategies
particularly difficult to be combined with. First, a simple scalar advection-diffusion equation
is considered as a prototype PDE for the development of a high order formulation of the semi-Lagrangian
IMEX algorithms. The advection part of the PDE is discretized explicitly at the aid of a SL technique,
while an implicit discretization is employed for the diffusion terms. Second, the SL-IMEX approach
is extended to deal with hyperbolic systems with multiple scales, including balance laws, that
involve shock waves and other discontinuities. A novel SL technique is proposed, which is based
on the integration of the governing equations over the space-time control volume which arises from
the motion of each grid point. High order of accuracy is ensured by the usage of IMEX RK schemes combined
with a Cauchy-Kowalevskaya procedure that provides a predictor solution within each space-time
element. The one-dimensional shallow water equations (SWE) are chosen to validate the new conservative
SL-IMEX schemes, where convection and pressure fluxes are treated explicitly and implicitly,
respectively. The asymptotic-preserving (AP) property of the novel schemes is also studied considering
a relaxation PDE system for the SWE. A large suite of convergence studies for both the non-conservative
and the conservative version of the novel class of methods demonstrates that the formal order of
accuracy is achieved and numerical evidences about the conservation property are shown. The AP
property for the corresponding relaxation system is also investigated.

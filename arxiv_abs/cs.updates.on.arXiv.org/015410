On Stack Overflow, users reuse 11,926,354 external links to share the resources hosted outside
the Stack Overflow website. The external links connect to the existing programming-related knowledge
and extend the crowdsourced knowledge on Stack Overflow. Some of the external links, so-called
as repeated external links, can be shared for multiple times. We observe that 82.5% of the link sharing
activities (i.e., sharing links in any question, answer, or comment) on Stack Overflow share external
resources, and 57.0% of the occurrences of the external links are sharing the repeated external
links. However, it is still unclear what types of external resources are repeatedly shared. To help
users manage their knowledge, we wish to investigate the characteristics of the repeated external
links in knowledge sharing on Stack Overflow. In this paper, we analyze the repeated external links
on Stack Overflow. We observe that external links that point to the text resources (hosted in documentation
websites, tutorial websites, etc.) are repeatedly shared the most. We observe that: 1) different
users repeatedly share the same knowledge in the form of repeated external links, thus increasing
the maintenance effort of knowledge (e.g., update invalid links in multiple posts), 2) the same
users can repeatedly share the external links for the purpose of promotion, and 3) external links
can point to webpages with an overload of information that is difficult for users to retrieve relevant
information. Our findings provide insights to Stack Overflow moderators and researchers. For
example, we encourage Stack Overflow to centrally manage the commonly occurring knowledge in the
form of repeated external links in order to better maintain the crowdsourced knowledge on Stack
Overflow.

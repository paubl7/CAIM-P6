Data privacy has become an increasingly important issue in machine learning. Many approaches have
been developed to tackle this issue, e.g., cryptography (Homomorphic Encryption, Differential
Privacy, etc.) and collaborative training (Secure Multi-Party Computation, Distributed Learning
and Federated Learning). These techniques have a particular focus on data encryption or secure
local computation. They transfer the intermediate information to the third-party to compute the
final result. Gradient exchanging is commonly considered to be a secure way of training a robust
model collaboratively in deep learning. However, recent researches have demonstrated that sensitive
information can be recovered from the shared gradient. Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN),
in particular, have shown to be effective in recovering those information. However, GAN based techniques
require additional information, such as class labels which are generally unavailable for privacy
persevered learning. In this paper, we show that, in Federated Learning (FL) system, image-based
privacy data can be easily recovered in full from the shared gradient only via our proposed Generative
Regression Neural Network (GRNN). We formulate the attack to be a regression problem and optimise
two branches of the generative model by minimising the distance between gradients. We evaluate
our method on several image classification tasks. The results illustrate that our proposed GRNN
outperforms state-of-the-art methods with better stability, stronger robustness, and higher
accuracy. It also has no convergence requirement to the global FL model. Moreover, we demonstrate
information leakage using face re-identification. Some defense strategies are also discussed
in this work.

The current development of the vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented. However, little is known
about the fine-grained public opinions on the coming vaccines. Using more than 40,000 rigorously
selected tweets (from over six million tweets collected using keywords) posted by over 20,000 distinct
Twitter users, we adopt a human-guided machine learning framework to capture the public opinions
on the potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 and classify them into three groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant,
and anti-vaccine. To investigate the scope and causes of public opinions, we compare the demographics,
social capitals, income, religious statuses as well as the political affiliations of these three
groups and find significant differences. A lower acceptance level for the potential COVID-19 vaccines
is observed among the socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. We further aggregate the opinions
at the state and country levels, and find that the percentage of the pro-vaccine group is lower in
the Southeast part of the United States. Interestingly, the major changes in the percentages of
different opinion groups roughly correspond to the major pandemic-related events. Next, by conducting
counterfactual analyses, we find that the U.S. public is most concerned about the safety, effectiveness,
and political issues with regards to the potential vaccines for COVID-19. In particular, we also
investigate the public opinions about the newly emerged mRNA vaccines and find the opinions vary
significantly across the religious beliefs: There are proportionally more religious people in
the anti-vaccine group. To our best knowledge, this is the first large-scale social media-based
study to analyze the public opinions on the potential COVID-19 vaccines that can inform more effective
vaccine distribution policies and strategies.

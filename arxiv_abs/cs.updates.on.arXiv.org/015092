Residual Dipolar Couplings (RDCs) acquired by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy
can be an indispensable source of information in investigation of molecular structures and dynamics.
Here we present a complete strategy for structure calculation and reconstruction of discrete state
dynamics from RDC data. Our method utilizes the previously presented REDCRAFT software package
and its dynamic-profile analysis to complete the task of fragmented structure determination and
identification of the onset of dynamics from RDC data. Fragmented structure determination was
used to demonstrate successful structure calculation of static and dynamic domains for several
models of dynamics. We provide a mechanism of producing an ensemble of conformations for the dynamical
regions that describe any observed order tensor discrepancies between the static and dynamic domains
within a protein. In addition, the presented method is capable of approximating relative occupancy
of each conformational state. The developed methodology has been evaluated on simulated RDC data
with 1Hz of error from an 83 residue {\alpha} protein (PDBID 1A1Z), and a 213 residue {\alpha}/\b{eta}
protein DGCR8 (PDBID 2YT4). Using 1A1Z, various models of arc and complex two and three discrete-state
dynamics were simulated. MD simulation was used to generate a 2-state dynamics for DGCR8. In both
instances our method reproduced structure of the protein including the conformational ensemble
to within less than 2{\AA}. Based on our investigations, arc motions with more than 30{\deg} of rotation
are recognized as internal dynamics and are reconstructed with sufficient accuracy. Furthermore,
states with relative occupancies above 20% are consistently recognized and reconstructed successfully.
Arc motions with magnitude of 15{\deg} or relative occupancy of less than 10% are consistently unrecognizable
as dynamical regions.

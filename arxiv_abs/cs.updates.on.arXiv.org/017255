Industrial standards for developing medical device software provide requirements that conforming
devices must meet. A number of reference software architectures have been proposed to develop such
software. The ISO/IEC 25010:2011 family of standards provides a comprehensive software product
quality model, including characteristics that are highly desirable in medical devices. Furthermore,
frameworks like 4+1 Views provide a robust framework to develop the software architecture or high
level design for any software, including for medical devices. However, the alignment between industrial
standards and reference architectures for medical device software, on one hand, and ISO/IEC 25010:2011
and 4+1 Views, on the other, is not well understood. This paper aims to explore how ISO/IEC 25010:2011
and 4+1 Views are supported by current standards, namely ISO 13485:2016, ISO 14971:2012, IEC 62304:2006
and IEC 62366:2015, and current reference architectures for medical device software. We classified
requirements from medical devices standards into qualities from ISO/IEC 25010:2011 and architectural
views from 4+1 Views. A systematic literature review (SLR) method was followed to review current
references software architectures and a mapping of their support for the identified ISO/IEC 25010:2011
qualities in the previous step was carried out. Our results show that ISO/IEC 25010:2011 qualities
like functional suitability, portability, maintainability, usability, security, reliability
and compatibility are highly emphasised in medical device standards. Furthermore, we show that
current reference architectures only partially support these qualities. This paper can help medical
device developers identify focus areas for developing standards-compliant software. A wider
study involving under-development medical devices can help improve the accuracy of our findings
in the future.

In computer vision, reference datasets have been highly successful in promoting algorithmic development
in stereo reconstruction. Surgical scenes gives rise to specific problems, including the lack
of clear corner features, highly specular surfaces and the presence of blood and smoke. Publicly
available datasets have been produced using CT and either phantom images or biological tissue samples
covering a relatively small region of the endoscope field-of-view. We present a stereo-endoscopic
reconstruction validation dataset based on CT (SERV-CT). Two {\it ex vivo} small porcine full torso
cadavers were placed within the view of the endoscope with both the endoscope and target anatomy
visible in the CT scan. Orientation of the endoscope was manually aligned to the stereoscopic view.
Reference disparities and occlusions were calculated for 8 stereo pairs from each sample. For the
second sample an RGB surface was acquired to aid alignment of smooth, featureless surfaces. Repeated
manual alignments showed an RMS disparity accuracy of ~2 pixels and a depth accuracy of ~2mm. The
reference dataset includes endoscope image pairs with corresponding calibration, disparities,
depths and occlusions covering the majority of the endoscopic image and a range of tissue types.
Smooth specular surfaces and images with significant variation of depth are included. We assessed
the performance of various stereo algorithms from online available repositories. There is a significant
variation between algorithms, highlighting some of the challenges of surgical endoscopic images.
The SERV-CT dataset provides an easy to use stereoscopic validation for surgical applications
with smooth reference disparities and depths with coverage over the majority of the endoscopic
images. This complements existing resources well and we hope will aid the development of surgical
endoscopic anatomical reconstruction algorithms.

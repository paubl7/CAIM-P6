The acquisition of non-proprietary and proprietary learning management system has provided a
richer learning experience to users and raised interest among education providers. This study
aims to assess student adoption of Canvas as a new learning management system and its potential as
a web-based platform in the e-learning programme of the University of the East. This study also assessed
student readiness in using Canvas. A survey was administered to 214 students of the University of
the East through snowball sampling. An Exploratory Factor Analysis was conducted to examine the
validity of the model. A Confirmatory Factory Analysis was used to validate the Exploratory Factor
Analysis results and analyse the correlation of the constructs. A Structural Equation Modelling
was conducted to analyse the relationships between the constructs, which were evaluated using
fit indices. Adopted from the Technology Acceptance Model, the constructs perceived ease of use,
perceived usefulness, and attitude were studied. The study reveals that students perceived usefulness
and attitude towards using Canvas in a web-based platform have direct and significant effects on
their intention to use Canvas. The students perceived ease of use has a significant effect on their
perceived usefulness but has no significant effects on their attitude towards the use of Canvas.
The students technological maturity and prior experience in using a learning management system
influenced their beliefs on the adaptation of similar technology. Exploring the potential benefits
of Canvas and factors affecting the students adoption amplifies access to quality education to
fulfil educational directives. Furthermore, educational institutions should explore technological
migration related to teaching and learning processes.

Objective assessment of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scans of osteoarthritis (OA) can address
the limitation of the current OA assessment. Segmentation of bone, cartilage, and joint fluid is
necessary for the OA objective assessment. Most of the proposed segmentation methods are not performing
instance segmentation and suffer from class imbalance problems. This study deployed Mask R-CNN
instance segmentation and improved it (improved-Mask R-CNN (iMaskRCNN)) to obtain a more accurate
generalized segmentation for OA-associated tissues. Training and validation of the method were
performed using 500 MRI knees from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) dataset and 97 MRI scans
of patients with symptomatic hip OA. Three modifications to Mask R-CNN yielded the iMaskRCNN: adding
a 2nd ROIAligned block, adding an extra decoder layer to the mask-header, and connecting them by
a skip connection. The results were assessed using Hausdorff distance, dice score, and coefficients
of variation (CoV). The iMaskRCNN led to improved bone and cartilage segmentation compared to Mask
RCNN as indicated with the increase in dice score from 95% to 98% for the femur, 95% to 97% for tibia,
71% to 80% for femoral cartilage, and 81% to 82% for tibial cartilage. For the effusion detection,
dice improved with iMaskRCNN 72% versus MaskRCNN 71%. The CoV values for effusion detection between
Reader1 and Mask R-CNN (0.33), Reader1 and iMaskRCNN (0.34), Reader2 and Mask R-CNN (0.22), Reader2
and iMaskRCNN (0.29) are close to CoV between two readers (0.21), indicating a high agreement between
the human readers and both Mask R-CNN and iMaskRCNN. Mask R-CNN and iMaskRCNN can reliably and simultaneously
extract different scale articular tissues involved in OA, forming the foundation for automated
assessment of OA. The iMaskRCNN results show that the modification improved the network performance
around the edges.

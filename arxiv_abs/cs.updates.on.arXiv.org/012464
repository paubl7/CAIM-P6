Researchers often treat data-driven and theory-driven models as two disparate or even conflicting
methods in travel behavior analysis. However, the two methods are highly complementary because
data-driven methods are more predictive but less interpretable and robust, while theory-driven
methods are more interpretable and robust but less predictive. Using their complementary nature,
this study designs a theory-based residual neural network (TB-ResNet) framework, which synergizes
discrete choice models (DCMs) and deep neural networks (DNNs) based on their shared utility interpretation.
The TB-ResNet framework is simple, as it uses a ($\delta$, 1-$\delta$) weighting to take advantage
of DCMs' simplicity and DNNs' richness, and to prevent underfitting from the DCMs and overfitting
from the DNNs. This framework is also flexible: three instances of TB-ResNets are designed based
on multinomial logit model (MNL-ResNets), prospect theory (PT-ResNets), and hyperbolic discounting
(HD-ResNets), which are tested on three data sets. Compared to pure DCMs, the TB-ResNets provide
greater prediction accuracy and reveal a richer set of behavioral mechanisms owing to the utility
function augmented by the DNN component in the TB-ResNets. Compared to pure DNNs, the TB-ResNets
can modestly improve prediction and significantly improve interpretation and robustness, because
the DCM component in the TB-ResNets stabilizes the utility functions and input gradients. Overall,
this study demonstrates that it is both feasible and desirable to synergize DCMs and DNNs by combining
their utility specifications under a TB-ResNet framework. Although some limitations remain,
this TB-ResNet framework is an important first step to create mutual benefits between DCMs and DNNs
for travel behavior modeling, with joint improvement in prediction, interpretation, and robustness.

Side-channel attacks are an unpredictable risk factor in cryptography. Therefore, continuous
observations of physical leakages are essential to minimise vulnerabilities associated with
cryptographic functions. Lightweight cryptography is a novel approach in progress towards internet-of-things
(IoT) security. Thus, it would provide sufficient data and privacy protection in such a constrained
ecosystem. IoT devices are resource-limited in terms of data rates (in kbps), power maintainability
(battery) as well as hardware and software footprints (physical size, internal memory, RAM/ROM).
Due to the difficulty in handling conventional cryptographic algorithms, lightweight ciphers
consist of small key sizes, block sizes and few operational rounds. Unlike in the past, affordability
to perform side-channel attacks using inexpensive electronic circuitries is becoming a reality.
Hence, cryptanalysis of physical leakage in these emerging ciphers is crucial. Among existing
studies, power analysis seems to have enough attention in research, whereas other aspects such
as electromagnetic, timing, cache and optical attacks continue to be appropriately evaluated
to play a role in forensic analysis. As a result, we started analysing electromagnetic emission
leakage of an ultra-lightweight block cipher, PRESENT. According to the literature, PRESENT promises
to be adequate for IoT devices, and there still seems not to exist any work regarding correlation
electromagnetic analysis (CEMA) of it. Firstly, we conducted simple electromagnetic analysis
in both time and frequency domains and then proceeded towards CEMA attack modelling. This paper
provides a summary of the related literature (IoT, lightweight cryptography, side-channel attacks
and EMA), our methodology, current outcomes and future plans for the optimised results.

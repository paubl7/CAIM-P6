The amount of interest in Virtual Reality (VR) research has significantly increased over the past
few years, both in academia and industry. The release of commercial VR Head-Mounted Displays (HMDs)
has been a major contributing factor. However, there is still much to be learned, especially how
views and input techniques, as well as their interaction, affect the VR experience. There is little
work done on First-Person Shooter (FPS) games in VR, and those few studies have focused on a single
aspect of VR FPS. They either focused on the view, e.g., comparing VR to a typical 2D display or on the
controller types. To the best of our knowledge, there are no studies investigating variations of
2D/3D views in HMDs, controller types, and their interactions. As such, it is challenging to distinguish
findings related to the controller type from those related to the view. If a study does not control
for the input method and finds that 2D displays lead to higher performance than VR, we cannot generalize
the results because of the confounding variables. To understand their interaction, we propose
to analyze in more depth, whether it is the view (2D vs. 3D) or the way it is controlled that gives the
platforms their respective advantages. To study the effects of the 2D/3D views, we created a 2D visual
technique, PlaneFrame, that was applied inside the VR headset. Our results show that the controller
type can have a significant positive impact on performance, immersion, and simulator sickness
when associated with a 2D view. They further our understanding of the interactions that controllers
and views have and demonstrate that comparisons are highly dependent on how both factors go together.
Further, through a series of three experiments, we developed a technique that can lead to a substantial
performance, a good level of immersion, and can minimize the level of simulator sickness.

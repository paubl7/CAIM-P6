In this contribution, we predict the wellhead protection area (WHPA, target), the shape and extent
of which is influenced by the distribution of hydraulic conductivity (K), from a small number of
tracing experiments (predictor). Our first objective is to make stochastic predictions of the
WHPA within the Bayesian Evidential Learning (BEL) framework, which aims to find a direct relationship
between predictor and target using machine learning. This relationship is learned from a small
set of training models (400) sampled from the prior distribution of K. The associated 400 pairs of
simulated predictors and targets are obtained through forward modelling. Newly collected field
data can then be directly used to predict the approximate posterior distribution of the corresponding
WHPA. The uncertainty range of the posterior WHPA distribution is affected by the number and position
of data sources (injection wells). Our second objective is to extend BEL to identify the optimal
design of data source locations that minimizes the posterior uncertainty of the WHPA. This can be
done explicitly, without averaging or approximating because once trained, the BEL model allows
the computation of the posterior uncertainty corresponding to any new input data. We use the Modified
Hausdorff Distance and the Structural Similarity index metrics to estimate the posterior uncertainty
range of the WHPA. Increasing the number of injection wells effectively reduces the derived posterior
WHPA uncertainty. Our approach can also estimate which injection wells are more informative than
others, as validated through a k-fold cross-validation procedure. Overall, the application of
BEL to experimental design makes it possible to identify the data sources maximizing the information
content of any measurement data.

Mobility-as-a-Service (MaaS) is emerging mobility trend driven by the concept of "Everything-as-a-Service"
and enabled through mobile internet technologies. In the context of economic deregulation, a MaaS
system consists of a typical two-sided market, where travelers and transportation service providers
(TSPs) are two groups of agents interacting with each other through a MaaS platform. In this study,
we propose a modeling and optimization framework for the regulation of two-sided MaaS markets.
We consider a double-auction mechanism where travelers submit purchase-bids to accommodate their
travel demand via MaaS, and TSPs submit sell-bids to supply mobility resources for the MaaS platform
in exchange for payments. We cast this problem as a single-leader multi-follower game (SLMFG) where
the leader is the MaaS regulator and two groups of follower problems represent the travelers and
the TSPs. The MaaS regulator makes the operating decisions to maximize its profits. In response
to the MaaS regulator's decisions, travelers (resp. TSPs) decide the participation levels of joining
the MaaS platform to minimize their travel costs (resp. maximize their profits). We formulate SLMFGs
without and with network effects leading to mixed-integer linear bilevel programming and mixed-integer
quadratic bilevel programming problems, respectively. We propose customized branch-and-bound
algorithms based on strong duality reformulations to solve the SLMFGs. Extensive numerical experiments
conducted on large scale simulation instances generated from realistic mobility data highlight
that the performance of the proposed algorithms is significantly superior to a benchmarking approach
and provide meaningful insights for the regulation of two-sided MaaS markets.

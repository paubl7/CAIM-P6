The algorithmic fairness of predictive analytic tools in the public sector has increasingly become
a topic of rigorous exploration. While instruments pertaining to criminal recidivism and academic
admissions, for example, have garnered much attention, the predictive instruments of Child Welfare
jurisdictions have received considerably less attention. This is in part because comparatively
few such instruments exist and because even fewer have been scrutinized through the lens of algorithmic
fairness. In this work, we seek to address both of these gaps. To this end, a novel classification
algorithm for predicting reunification success within Oregon Child Welfare is presented, including
all of the relevant details associated with building such an instrument. The purpose of this tool
is to maximize the number of stable reunifications and identify potentially unstable reunifications
which may require additional resources and scrutiny. Additionally, because the algorithmic fairness
of the resulting tool, if left unaltered, is unquestionably lacking, the utilized procedure for
mitigating such unfairness is presented, along with the rationale behind each difficult and unavoidable
choice. This procedure, though similar to other post-processing group-specific thresholding
methods, is novel in its use of a penalized optimizer and contextually requisite subsampling. These
novel methodological components yield a rich and informative empirical understanding of the trade-off
continuum between fairness and accuracy. As the developed procedure is generalizable across a
variety of group-level definitions of algorithmic fairness, as well as across an arbitrary number
of protected attribute levels and risk thresholds, the approach is broadly applicable both within
and beyond Child Welfare.

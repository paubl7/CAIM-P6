Bitcoin and its underlying blockchain protocol have recently received significant attention
in the context of building distributed systems and foundations of the consensus problem. At the
same time, the rapid development in quantum computing makes the threats to cryptography more and
more concerning. In this work, we revisit the formal security of the core of the Bitcoin consensus
protocol, called the Bitcoin backbone (Eurocrypt 2015), in the presence of quantum adversaries
-- i.e. adversaries equipped with quantum computers. We show that the security of the Bitcoin backbone
holds under a quantum analogue of the ``honest majority'' assumption that we develop. The critical
ingredient of proving security of the blockchain is to analyzing the quantum query complexity of
a Chain-of-Proofs-of-Work search problem. This problem in turn reduces to a problem we call multi-solution
Bernoulli search, for which we establish its quantum query complexity. This can be viewed as an extension
of a threshold direct product theorem to an average-case unstructured search problem. Our proof,
adding to active recent efforts, simplifies and generalizes the powerful recording technique
due to Zhandry (Crypto 2019). Our analysis indicates that the security of the Bitcoin backbone protocol
is guaranteed provided that the number of adversarial quantum queries is bounded so that each quantum
query is worth $O(p^{-1/2})$ classical ones, where $p$ is the probability of success of a single
classical query to the protocol's underlying hash function. Perhaps surprisingly, the wait time
for safe settlement of transactions in the case of quantum adversaries matches (up to a constant)
the safe settlement time in the classical case and thus does not result in any further overhead.

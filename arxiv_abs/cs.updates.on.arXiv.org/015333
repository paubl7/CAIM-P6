To reduce Operation and Maintenance (O&M) costs on offshore wind farms, wherein 80% of the O&M cost
relates to deploying personnel, the offshore wind sector looks to Robotics and Artificial Intelligence
(RAI) for solutions. Barriers to Beyond Visual Line of Sight (BVLOS) robotics include operational
safety compliance and resilience, inhibiting the commercialization of autonomous services offshore.
To address safety and resilience challenges we propose a Symbiotic System Of Systems Approach (SSOSA);
reflecting the lifecycle learning and co-evolution with knowledge sharing for mutual gain of robotic
platforms and remote human operators. Our novel methodology enables the run-time verification
of safety, reliability and resilience during autonomous missions. To achieve this, a Symbiotic
Digital Architecture (SDA) was developed to synchronize digital models of the robot, environment
and infrastructure and integrate front-end analytics and bidirectional communication for autonomous
adaptive mission planning and situation reporting to a remote operator. A reliability ontology
for the deployed robot, based on our holistic hierarchical-relational model, supports computationally
efficient platform data analysis. We demonstrate an asset inspection mission within a confined
space through collaborative governance (internal and external symbiosis) via decision-making
processes and the associated structures. We create a hyper enabled human interaction capability
to analyze the mission status, diagnostics of critical sub-systems within the robot to provide
automatic updates to our AI-driven run-time reliability ontology. This enables faults to be translated
into failure modes for decision making during the mission. We also increase situational awareness
with foresight sensing, based on robust, opaque environment compliant sensing to monitor unforeseen
ambient risks.

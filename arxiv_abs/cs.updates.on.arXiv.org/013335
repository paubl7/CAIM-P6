Quantum Computing is considered as the next frontier in computing, and it is attracting a lot of attention
from the current scientific community. This kind of computation provides to researchers with a
revolutionary paradigm for addressing complex optimization problems, offering a significant
speed advantage and an efficient search ability. Anyway, despite hopes placed in this field are
high, Quantum Computing is still in an incipient stage of development. For this reason, present
architectures show certain limitations in terms of computational capabilities and performance.
These limitations have motivated the carrying out of this paper. With this paper, we contribute
to the field introducing a novel solving scheme coined as hybrid Quantum Computing - Tabu Search
Algorithm. Main pillars of operation of the proposed method are a greater control over the access
to quantum resources, and a considerable reduction of non-profitable accesses. For assessing
the quality of our method, we have used the well-known TSP as benchmarking problem. Furthermore,
the performance of QTA has been compared with QBSolv -- a state-of-the-art decomposing solver --
on a set of 7 different TSP instances. The obtained experimental outcomes support the preliminary
conclusion that QTA is an approach which offers promising results for solving partitioning problems,
while it drastically reduces the access to QC resources. Furthermore, we also contribute in this
paper to the field of Transfer Optimization by developing and using a evolutionary multiform multitasking
algorithm as initialization method for the introduced hybrid Quantum Computing - Tabu Search Algorithm.
Concretely, the evolutionary multitasking algorithm implemented is a multiform variant of the
recently published Coevolutionary Variable Neighborhood Search Algorithm for Discrete Multitasking.

Camera traps are used worldwide to monitor wildlife. Despite the increasing availability of Deep
Learning (DL) models, the effective usage of this technology to support wildlife monitoring is
limited. This is mainly due to the complexity of DL technology and high computing requirements.
This paper presents the implementation of the light-weight and state-of-the-art YOLOv5 architecture
for automated labeling of camera trap images of mammals in the Bialowieza Forest (BF), Poland. The
camera trapping data were organized and harmonized using TRAPPER software, an open source application
for managing large-scale wildlife monitoring projects. The proposed image recognition pipeline
achieved an average accuracy of 85% F1-score in the identification of the 12 most commonly occurring
medium-size and large mammal species in BF using a limited set of training and testing data (a total
2659 images with animals). Based on the preliminary results, we concluded that the YOLOv5 object
detection and classification model is a promising light-weight DL solution after the adoption
of transfer learning technique. It can be efficiently plugged in via an API into existing web-based
camera trapping data processing platforms such as e.g. TRAPPER system. Since TRAPPER is already
used to manage and classify (manually) camera trapping datasets by many research groups in Europe,
the implementation of AI-based automated species classification may significantly speed up the
data processing workflow and thus better support data-driven wildlife monitoring and conservation.
Moreover, YOLOv5 developers perform better performance on edge devices which may open a new chapter
in animal population monitoring in real time directly from camera trap devices.

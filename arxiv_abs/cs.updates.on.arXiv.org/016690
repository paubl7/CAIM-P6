By encoding computing tasks, coded computing can not only mitigate straggling problems in federated
learning (FL), but also preserve privacy of sensitive data uploaded/contributed by participating
mobile users (MUs) to the centralized server, owned by a mobile application provider (MAP). However,
these advantages come with extra coding cost/complexity and communication overhead (referred
to as \emph{privacy cost}) that must be considered given the limited computing/communications
resources at MUs/MAP, the rationality and incentive competition among MUs in contributing data
to the MAP. This article proposes a novel coded FL-based framework for a privacy-aware mobile application
service to address these challenges. In particular, the MAP first determines a set of the best MUs
for the FL process based on MUs' provided information/features. Then, each selected MU can propose
a contract to the MAP according to its expected trainable local data and privacy-protected coded
data. To find the optimal contracts that can maximize utilities of the MAP and all the participating
MUs while maintaining high learning quality of the whole system, we first develop a multi-principal
one-agent contract-based problem leveraging coded FL-based multiple utility functions under
the MUs' privacy cost, the MAP's limited computing resource, and asymmetric information between
the MAP and MUs. Then, we transform the problem into an equivalent low-complexity problem and develop
an iterative algorithm to solve it. Experiments with a real-world dataset show that our framework
can speed up training time up to 49% and improve prediction accuracy up to 4.6 times while enhancing
network's social welfare, i.e., total utility of all participating entities, up to 114% under the
privacy cost consideration compared with those of baseline methods.

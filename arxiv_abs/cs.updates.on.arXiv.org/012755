During the COVID-19 pandemic, a massive number of attempts on the predictions of the number of cases
and the other future trends of this pandemic have been made. However, they fail to predict, in a reliable
way, the medium and long term evolution of fundamental features of COVID-19 outbreak within acceptable
accuracy. This paper gives an explanation for the failure of machine learning models in this particular
forecasting problem. The paper shows that simple linear regression models provide high prediction
accuracy values reliably but only for a 2-weeks period and that relatively complex machine learning
models, which have the potential of learning long term predictions with low errors, cannot achieve
to obtain good predictions with possessing a high generalization ability. It is suggested in the
paper that the lack of a sufficient number of samples is the source of low prediction performance
of the forecasting models. The reliability of the forecasting results about the active cases is
measured in terms of the cross-validation prediction errors, which are used as expectations for
the generalization errors of the forecasters. To exploit the information, which is of most relevant
with the active cases, we perform feature selection over a variety of variables. We apply different
feature selection methods, namely the Pairwise Correlation, Recursive Feature Selection, and
feature selection by using the Lasso regression and compare them to each other and also with the models
not employing any feature selection. Furthermore, we compare Linear Regression, Multi-Layer
Perceptron, and Long-Short Term Memory models each of which is used for prediction active cases
together with the mentioned feature selection methods. Our results show that the accurate forecasting
of the active cases with high generalization ability is possible up to 3 days only because of the small
sample size of COVID-19 data.

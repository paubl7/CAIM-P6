Colorectal cancer is one of the most common and lethal cancers and colorectal cancer liver metastases
(CRLM) is the major cause of death in patients with colorectal cancer. Multifocality occurs frequently
in CRLM, but is relatively unexplored in CRLM outcome prediction. Most existing clinical and imaging
biomarkers do not take the imaging features of all multifocal lesions into account. In this paper,
we present an end-to-end autoencoder-based multiple instance neural network (AMINN) for the prediction
of survival outcomes in multifocal CRLM patients using radiomic features extracted from contrast-enhanced
MRIs. Specifically, we jointly train an autoencoder to reconstruct input features and a multiple
instance network to make predictions by aggregating information from all tumour lesions of a patient.
In addition, we incorporate a two-step normalization technique to improve the training of deep
neural networks, built on the observation that the distributions of radiomic features are almost
always severely skewed. Experimental results empirically validated our hypothesis that incorporating
imaging features of all lesions improves outcome prediction for multifocal cancer. The proposed
ADMINN framework achieved an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.70, which is 19.5% higher than baseline
methods. We built a risk score based on the outputs of our network and compared it to other clinical
and imaging biomarkers. Our risk score is the only one that achieved statistical significance in
univariate and multivariate cox proportional hazard modeling in our cohort of multifocal CRLM
patients. The effectiveness of incorporating all lesions and applying two-step normalization
is demonstrated by a series of ablation studies. Our code will be released after the peer-review
process.

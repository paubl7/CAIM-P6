Once integrated into clinical care, patient risk stratification models may perform worse compared
to their retrospective performance. To date, it is widely accepted that performance will degrade
over time due to changes in care processes and patient populations. However, the extent to which
this occurs is poorly understood, in part because few researchers report prospective validation
performance. In this study, we compare the 2020-2021 ('20-'21) prospective performance of a patient
risk stratification model for predicting healthcare-associated infections to a 2019-2020 ('19-'20)
retrospective validation of the same model. We define the difference in retrospective and prospective
performance as the performance gap. We estimate how i) "temporal shift", i.e., changes in clinical
workflows and patient populations, and ii) "infrastructure shift", i.e., changes in access, extraction
and transformation of data, both contribute to the performance gap. Applied prospectively to 26,864
hospital encounters during a twelve-month period from July 2020 to June 2021, the model achieved
an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.767 (95% confidence interval
(CI): 0.737, 0.801) and a Brier score of 0.189 (95% CI: 0.186, 0.191). Prospective performance decreased
slightly compared to '19-'20 retrospective performance, in which the model achieved an AUROC of
0.778 (95% CI: 0.744, 0.815) and a Brier score of 0.163 (95% CI: 0.161, 0.165). The resulting performance
gap was primarily due to infrastructure shift and not temporal shift. So long as we continue to develop
and validate models using data stored in large research data warehouses, we must consider differences
in how and when data are accessed, measure how these differences may affect prospective performance,
and work to mitigate those differences.

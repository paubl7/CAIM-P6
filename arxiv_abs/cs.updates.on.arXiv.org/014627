We develop new approximation algorithms for classical graph and set problems in the RAM model under
space constraints. As one of our main results, we devise an algorithm for d-Hitting Set that runs
in time n^{O(d^2 + d/\epsilon})}, uses O((d^2 + d/\epsilon) log n) bits of space, and achieves an
approximation ratio of O((d/{\epsilon}) n^{\epsilon}) for any positive \epsilon \leq 1 and any
natural number d. In particular, this yields a factor-O(log n) approximation algorithm which runs
in time n^{O(log n)} and uses O(log^2 n) bits of space (for constant d). As a corollary, we obtain similar
bounds for Vertex Cover and several graph deletion problems. For bounded-multiplicity problem
instances, one can do better. We devise a factor-2 approximation algorithm for Vertex Cover on graphs
with maximum degree \Delta, and an algorithm for computing maximal independent sets which both
run in time n^{O(\Delta)} and use O(\Delta log n) bits of space. For the more general d-Hitting Set
problem, we devise a factor-d approximation algorithm which runs in time n^{O(d {\delta}^2)} and
uses O(d {\delta}^2 log n) bits of space on set families where each element appears in at most \delta
sets. For Independent Set restricted to graphs with average degree d, we give a factor-(2d) approximation
algorithm which runs in polynomial time and uses O(log n) bits of space. We also devise a factor-O(d^2)
approximation algorithm for Dominating Set on d-degenerate graphs which runs in time n^{O(log
n)} and uses O(log^2 n) bits of space. For d-regular graphs, we show how a known randomized factor-O(log
d) approximation algorithm can be derandomized to run in time n^{O(1)} and use O(log n) bits of space.
Our results use a combination of ideas from the theory of kernelization, distributed algorithms
and randomized algorithms.

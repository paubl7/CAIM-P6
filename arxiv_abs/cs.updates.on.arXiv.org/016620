This work considers a novel information design problem and studies how the craft of payoff-relevant
environmental signals solely can influence the behaviors of intelligent agents. The agents' strategic
interactions are captured by a Markov game, in which each agent first selects one external signal
from multiple signal sources as additional payoff-relevant information and then takes an action.
There is a rational information designer (principal) who possesses one signal source and aims to
influence the equilibrium behaviors of the agents by designing the information structure of her
signals sent to the agents. We propose a direct information design approach that incentivizes each
agent to select the signal sent by the principal, such that the design process avoids the predictions
of the agents' strategic selection behaviors. We then introduce the design protocol given a goal
of the designer which we refer to as obedient implementability (OIL) and characterize the OIL in
a class of obedient sequential Markov perfect equilibria (O-SMPE). A design regime is proposed
based on an approach which we refer to as the fixed-point alignment that incentivizes the agents
to choose the signal sent by the principal, guarantees that the agents' policy profile of taking
actions is the policy component of an O-SMPE and the principal's goal is achieved. We then formulate
the principal's optimal goal selection problem in terms of information design and characterize
the optimization problem by minimizing the fixed-point misalignments. The proposed approach
can be applied to elicit desired behaviors of multi-agent systems in competing as well as cooperating
settings and be extended to heterogeneous stochastic games in the complete- and the incomplete-information
environments.

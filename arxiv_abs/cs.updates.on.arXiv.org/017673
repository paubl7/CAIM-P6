The frequency-based method is the most commonly used method for measuring cable tension. However,
the calculation formulas for the conventional frequency-based method are generally based on the
ideally hinged or fixed boundary conditions without a comprehensive consideration of the inclination
angle, sag-extensibility, and flexural stiffness of cables, leading to a significant error in
cable tension identification. This study aimed to propose a frequency-based method of cable tension
identification considering the complex boundary conditions at the two ends of cables using the
particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. First, the refined stay cable model was established
considering the inclination angle, flexural stiffness, and sag-extensibility, as well as the
rotational constraint stiffness and lateral support stiffness for the unknown boundaries of cables.
The vibration mode equation of the stay cable model was discretized and solved using the finite difference
method. Then, a multiparameter identification method based on the PSO algorithm was proposed.
This method was able to identify the tension, flexural stiffness, axial stiffness, boundary rotational
constraint stiffness, and boundary lateral support stiffness according to the measured multiorder
frequencies in a synchronous manner. The feasibility and accuracy of this method were validated
through numerical cases. Finally, the proposed approach was applied to the tension identification
of the anchor span strands of a suspension bridge (Jindong Bridge) in China. The results of cable
tension identification using the proposed method and the existing methods discussed in previous
studies were compared with the on-site pressure ring measurement results. The comparison showed
that the proposed approach had a high accuracy in cable tension identification.

Virtual reality (VR) head-mounted displays (HMD) appear to be effective research tools, which
may address the problem of ecological validity in neuropsychological testing. However, their
widespread implementation is hindered by VR induced symptoms and effects (VRISE) and the lack of
skills in VR software development. This study offers guidelines for the development of VR software
in cognitive neuroscience and neuropsychology, by describing and discussing the stages of the
development of Virtual Reality Everyday Assessment Lab (VR-EAL), the first neuropsychological
battery in immersive VR. Techniques for evaluating cognitive functions within a realistic storyline
are discussed. The utility of various assets in Unity, software development kits, and other software
are described so that cognitive scientists can overcome challenges pertinent to VRISE and the quality
of the VR software. In addition, this pilot study attempts to evaluate VR-EAL in accordance with
the necessary criteria for VR software for research purposes. The VR neuroscience questionnaire
(VRNQ; Kourtesis et al., 2019b) was implemented to appraise the quality of the three versions of
VR-EAL in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game assistance, and VRISE. Twenty-five
participants aged between 20 and 45 years with 12-16 years of full-time education evaluated various
versions of VR-EAL. The final version of VR-EAL achieved high scores in every sub-score of the VRNQ
and exceeded its parsimonious cut-offs. It also appeared to have better in-game assistance and
game mechanics, while its improved graphics substantially increased the quality of the user experience
and almost eradicated VRISE. The results substantially support the feasibility of the development
of effective VR research and clinical software without the presence of VRISE during a 60-minute
VR session.

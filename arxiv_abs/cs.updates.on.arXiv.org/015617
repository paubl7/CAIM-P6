Real-world time series data often present recurrent or repetitive patterns and it is often generated
in real time, such as transportation passenger volume, network traffic, system resource consumption,
energy usage, and human gait. Detecting anomalous events based on machine learning approaches
in such time series data has been an active research topic in many different areas. However, most
machine learning approaches require labeled datasets, offline training, and may suffer from high
computation complexity, consequently hindering their applicability. Providing a lightweight
self-adaptive approach that does not need offline training in advance and meanwhile is able to detect
anomalies in real time could be highly beneficial. Such an approach could be immediately applied
and deployed on any commodity machine to provide timely anomaly alerts. To facilitate such an approach,
this paper introduces SALAD, which is a Self-Adaptive Lightweight Anomaly Detection approach
based on a special type of recurrent neural networks called Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Instead
of using offline training, SALAD converts a target time series into a series of average absolute
relative error (AARE) values on the fly and predicts an AARE value for every upcoming data point based
on short-term historical AARE values. If the difference between a calculated AARE value and its
corresponding forecast AARE value is higher than a self-adaptive detection threshold, the corresponding
data point is considered anomalous. Otherwise, the data point is considered normal. Experiments
based on two real-world open-source time series datasets demonstrate that SALAD outperforms five
other state-of-the-art anomaly detection approaches in terms of detection accuracy. In addition,
the results also show that SALAD is lightweight and can be deployed on a commodity machine.

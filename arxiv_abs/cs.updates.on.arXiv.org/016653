Digitalization offers a large number of promising tools for large internal combustion engines
such as condition monitoring or condition-based maintenance. This includes the status evaluation
of key engine components such as cylinder liners, whose inner surfaces are subject to constant wear
due to their movement relative to the pistons. Existing state-of-the-art methods for quantifying
wear require disassembly and cutting of the examined liner followed by a high-resolution microscopic
surface depth measurement that quantitatively evaluates wear based on bearing load curves (also
known as Abbott-Firestone curves). Such reference methods are destructive, time-consuming and
costly. The goal of the research presented here is to develop nondestructive yet reliable methods
for quantifying the surface condition. A deep-learning framework is proposed that allows computation
of the bearing load curves from reflection RGB images of the liner surface that can be collected with
a wide variety of simple imaging devices, without the need to remove and destroy the investigated
liner. For this purpose, a convolutional neural network is trained to predict the bearing load curve
of the corresponding depth profile from the collected RGB images, which in turn can be used for further
wear evaluation. Training of the network is performed using a custom-built database containing
depth profiles and reflection images of liner surfaces of large gas engines. The results of the proposed
method are visually examined and quantified considering several probabilistic distance metrics
and comparison of roughness indicators between ground truth and model predictions. The observed
success of the proposed method suggests its great potential for quantitative wear assessment on
engines during service directly on site.

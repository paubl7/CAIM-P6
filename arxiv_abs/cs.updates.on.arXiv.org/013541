Existing deepfake detection methods have reported promising in-distribution results, by accessing
published large-scale dataset. However, due to the non-smooth synthesis method, the fake samples
in this dataset may expose obvious artifacts (e.g., stark visual contrast, non-smooth boundary),
which were heavily relied on by most of the frame-level detection methods above. As these artifacts
do not come up in real media forgeries, the above methods can suffer from a large degradation when
applied to fake images that close to reality. To improve the robustness for high-realism fake data,
we propose the Invariant Texture Learning (InTeLe) framework, which only accesses the published
dataset with low visual quality. Our method is based on the prior that the microscopic facial texture
of the source face is inevitably violated by the texture transferred from the target person, which
can hence be regarded as the invariant characterization shared among all fake images. To learn such
an invariance for deepfake detection, our InTeLe introduces an auto-encoder framework with different
decoders for pristine and fake images, which are further appended with a shallow classifier in order
to separate out the obvious artifact-effect. Equipped with such a separation, the extracted embedding
by encoder can capture the texture violation in fake images, followed by the classifier for the final
pristine/fake prediction. As a theoretical guarantee, we prove the identifiability of such an
invariance texture violation, i.e., to be precisely inferred from observational data. The effectiveness
and utility of our method are demonstrated by promising generalization ability from low-quality
images with obvious artifacts to fake images with high realism.

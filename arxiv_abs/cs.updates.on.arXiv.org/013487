In this paper we focus on the empirical variable-selection peformance of subsample-ordered least
angle regression (Solar) -- a novel ultrahigh dimensional redesign of lasso -- on the empirical
data with complicated dependence structures and, hence, severe multicollinearity and grouping
effect issues. Previous researches show that Solar largely alleviates several known high-dimensional
issues with least-angle regression and $\mathcal{L}_1$ shrinkage. Also, With the same computation
load, solar yields substantiali mprovements over two lasso solvers (least-angle regression for
lasso and coordinate-descent) in terms of the sparsity (37-64\% reduction in the average number
of selected variables), stability and accuracy of variable selection. Simulations also demonstrate
that solar enhances the robustness of variable selection to different settings of the irrepresentable
condition and to variations in the dependence structures assumed in regression analysis. To confirm
that the improvements are also available for empirical researches, we choose the prostate cancer
data and the Sydney house price data and apply two lasso solvers, elastic net and Solar on them for
comparison. The results shows that (i) lasso is affected by the grouping effect and randomly drop
variables with high correlations, resulting unreliable and uninterpretable results; (ii) elastic
net is more robust to grouping effect; however, it completely lose variable-selection sparsity
when the dependence structure of the data is complicated; (iii) solar demonstrates its superior
robustness to complicated dependence structures and grouping effect, returning variable-selection
results with better stability and sparsity. The code can be found at https://github.com/isaac2math/solar_application

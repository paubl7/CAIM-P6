Current discussions on the sixth Generation (6G) of wireless communications are envisioning future
networks as a unified communication, sensing, and computing platform that intelligently enables
diverse services, ranging from immersive to mission critical applications. The recently conceived
concept of the smart radio environment, enabled by Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs),
contributes towards this intelligent networking trend, offering programmable propagation of
information-bearing signals, which can be jointly optimized with transceiver operations. Typical
RIS implementations include metasurfaces with nearly passive meta-atoms, allowing to solely
reflect the incident wave in an externally controllable way. However, this purely reflective nature
induces significant challenges in the RIS orchestration from the wireless network. For example,
channel estimation, which is essential for coherent communications in RIS-empowered wireless
networks, is quite challenging with the available RIS designs. This article introduces the concept
of Hybrid reflecting and sensing RISs (HRISs), which enables metasurfaces to reflect the impinging
signal in a controllable manner, while simultaneously sense a portion of it. The sensing capability
of HRISs facilitates various network management functionalities, including channel estimation
and localization. We discuss a hardware design for HRISs and detail a full-wave proof-of-concept.
We highlight their distinctive properties in comparison to reflective RISs and active relays,
and present a simulation study evaluating the HRIS capability for performing channel estimation.
Future research challenges and opportunities arising from the concept of HRISs are presented.

We present a novel multi-stage 3D computer-aided detection and diagnosis (CAD) model for automated
localization of clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) in bi-parametric MR imaging (bpMRI).
Deep attention mechanisms drive its detection network, targeting multi-resolution, salient
structures and highly discriminative feature dimensions, in order to accurately identify csPCa
lesions from indolent cancer and the wide range of benign pathology that can afflict the prostate
gland. In parallel, a decoupled residual classifier is used to achieve consistent false positive
reduction, without sacrificing high sensitivity or computational efficiency. In addition, a
probabilistic anatomical prior, which captures the spatial prevalence and zonal distinction
of csPCa, is computed and encoded into the CNN architecture to guide model generalization with domain-specific
clinical knowledge. We hypothesize that such CNN-based models can be trained to detect biopsy-confirmed
malignancies in an independent cohort, using a large dataset of 1950 prostate bpMRI paired with
radiologically-estimated annotations. For 486 institutional testing scans, the 3D CAD system
achieves $83.69\pm5.22\%$ and $93.19\pm2.96\%$ detection sensitivity at $0.50$ and $1.46$ false
positive(s) per patient, respectively, and $0.882$ AUROC in patient-based diagnosis --significantly
outperforming four state-of-the-art baseline architectures (U-SEResNet, UNet++, nnU-Net,
Attention U-Net) from recent literature. For 296 external testing scans, the ensembled CAD system
shares moderate agreement with a consensus of expert radiologists ($76.69\%$; $kappa=0.51\pm0.04$)
and independent pathologists ($81.08\%$; $kappa=0.56\pm0.06$); demonstrating strong generalization
to histologically-confirmed csPCa diagnosis.

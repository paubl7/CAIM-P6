Consensus protocols have traditionally been studied in a setting where all participants are known
to each other from the start of the protocol execution. In the parlance of the 'blockchain' literature,
this is referred to as the permissioned setting. What differentiates Bitcoin from these previously
studied protocols is that it operates in a permissionless setting, i.e. it is a protocol for establishing
consensus over an unknown network of participants that anybody can join, with as many identities
as they like in any role. The arrival of this new form of protocol brings with it many questions. Beyond
Bitcoin, what can we prove about permissionless protocols in a general sense? How does recent work
on permissionless protocols in the blockchain literature relate to the well-developed history
of research on permissioned protocols in distributed computing? To answer these questions, we
describe a formal framework for the analysis of both permissioned and permissionless systems.
Our framework allows for "apples-to-apples" comparisons between different categories of protocols
and, in turn, the development of theory to formally discuss their relative merits. A major benefit
of the framework is that it facilitates the application of a rich history of proofs and techniques
in distributed computing to problems in blockchain and the study of permissionless systems. Within
our framework, we then address the questions above. We consider the Byzantine Generals Problem
as a formalisation of the problem of reaching consensus, and address a programme of research that
asks, "Under what adversarial conditions, and for what types of permissionless protocol, is consensus
possible?" We prove a number of results for this programme, our main result being that deterministic
consensus is not possible for decentralised permissionless protocols. To close, we give a list
of seven open questions.

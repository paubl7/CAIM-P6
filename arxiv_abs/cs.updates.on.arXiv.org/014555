Most recent person re-identification approaches are based on the use of deep convolutional neural
networks (CNNs). These networks, although effective in multiple tasks such as classification
or object detection, tend to focus on the most discriminative part of an object rather than retrieving
all its relevant features. This behavior penalizes the performance of a CNN for the re-identification
task, since it should identify diverse and fine grained features. It is then essential to make the
network learn a wide variety of finer characteristics in order to make the re-identification process
of people effective and robust to finer changes. In this article, we introduce Deep Miner, a method
that allows CNNs to "mine" richer and more diverse features about people for their re-identification.
Deep Miner is specifically composed of three types of branches: a Global branch (G-branch), a Local
branch (L-branch) and an Input-Erased branch (IE-branch). G-branch corresponds to the initial
backbone which predicts global characteristics, while L-branch retrieves part level resolution
features. The IE-branch for its part, receives partially suppressed feature maps as input thereby
allowing the network to "mine" new features (those ignored by G-branch) as output. For this special
purpose, a dedicated suppression procedure for identifying and removing features within a given
CNN is introduced. This suppression procedure has the major benefit of being simple, while it produces
a model that significantly outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) re-identification methods.
Specifically, we conduct experiments on four standard person re-identification benchmarks and
witness an absolute performance gain up to 6.5% mAP compared to SOTA.

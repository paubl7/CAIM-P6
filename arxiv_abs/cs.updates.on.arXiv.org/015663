We study the complexity of a range of propositional proof systems which allow inference rules of
the form: from a set of clauses $\Gamma$ derive the set of clauses $\Gamma \cup \{ C \}$ where, due to
some syntactic condition, $\Gamma \cup \{ C \}$ is satisfiable if $\Gamma$ is, but where $\Gamma$
does not necessarily imply $C$. These inference rules include BC, RAT, SPR and PR (respectively
short for blocked clauses, resolution asymmetric tautologies, subset propagation redundancy
and propagation redundancy), which arose from work in satisfiability (SAT) solving. We introduce
a new, more general rule SR (substitution redundancy). If the new clause $C$ is allowed to include
new variables then the systems based on these rules are all equivalent to extended resolution. We
focus on restricted systems that do not allow new variables. The systems with deletion, where we
can delete a clause from our set at any time, are denoted DBC${}^-$, DRAT${}^-$, DSPR${}^-$, DPR${}^-$
and DSR${}^-$. The systems without deletion are BC${}^-$, RAT${}^-$, SPR${}^-$, PR${}^-$ and
SR${}^-$. With deletion, we show that DRAT${}^-$, DSPR${}^-$ and DPR${}^-$ are equivalent. By
earlier work of Kiesl, Rebola-Pardo and Heule, they are also equivalent to DBC${}^-$. Without deletion,
we show that SPR${}^-$ can simulate PR${}^-$ provided only short clauses are inferred by SPR inferences.
We also show that many of the well-known "hard" principles have small SPR${}^-$ refutations. These
include the pigeonhole principle, bit pigeonhole principle, parity principle, Tseitin tautologies
and clique-coloring tautologies. SPR${}^-$ can also handle or-fication and xor-ification, and
lifting with an index gadget. Our final result is an exponential size lower bound for RAT${}^-$ refutations,
giving exponential separations between RAT${}^-$ and both DRAT${}^-$ and SPR${}^-$.

In online advertising, auto-bidding has become an essential tool for advertisers to optimize their
preferred ad performance metrics by simply expressing the high-level campaign objectives and
constraints. Previous works consider the design of auto-bidding agents from the single-agent
view without modeling the mutual influence between agents. In this paper, we instead consider this
problem from the perspective of a distributed multi-agent system, and propose a general Multi-Agent
reinforcement learning framework for Auto-Bidding, namely MAAB, to learn the auto-bidding strategies.
First, we investigate the competition and cooperation relation among auto-bidding agents, and
propose temperature-regularized credit assignment for establishing a mixed cooperative-competitive
paradigm. By carefully making a competition and cooperation trade-off among the agents, we can
reach an equilibrium state that guarantees not only individual advertiser's utility but also the
system performance (social welfare). Second, due to the observed collusion behaviors of bidding
low prices underlying the cooperation, we further propose bar agents to set a personalized bidding
bar for each agent, and then to alleviate the degradation of revenue. Third, to deploy MAAB to the
large-scale advertising system with millions of advertisers, we propose a mean-field approach.
By grouping advertisers with the same objective as a mean auto-bidding agent, the interactions
among advertisers are greatly simplified, making it practical to train MAAB efficiently. Extensive
experiments on the offline industrial dataset and Alibaba advertising platform demonstrate that
our approach outperforms several baseline methods in terms of social welfare and guarantees the
ad platform's revenue.

The use of computer-aided diagnosis in the reliable and fast detection of coronavirus disease (COVID-19)
has become a necessity to prevent the spread of the virus during the pandemic to ease the burden on
the medical infrastructure. Chest X-ray (CXR) imaging has several advantages over other imaging
techniques as it is cheap, easily accessible, fast and portable. This paper explores the effect
of various popular image enhancement techniques and states the effect of each of them on the detection
performance. We have compiled the largest X-ray dataset called COVQU-20, consisting of 18,479
normal, non-COVID lung opacity and COVID-19 CXR images. To the best of our knowledge, this is the
largest public COVID positive database. Ground glass opacity is the common symptom reported in
COVID-19 pneumonia patients and so a mixture of 3616 COVID-19, 6012 non-COVID lung opacity, and
8851 normal chest X-ray images were used to create this dataset. Five different image enhancement
techniques: histogram equalization, contrast limited adaptive histogram equalization, image
complement, gamma correction, and Balance Contrast Enhancement Technique were used to improve
COVID-19 detection accuracy. Six different Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) were investigated
in this study. Gamma correction technique outperforms other enhancement techniques in detecting
COVID-19 from standard and segmented lung CXR images. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, f1-score,
and specificity in the detection of COVID-19 with gamma correction on CXR images were 96.29%, 96.28%,
96.29%, 96.28% and 96.27% respectively. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, F1-score, and
specificity were 95.11 %, 94.55 %, 94.56 %, 94.53 % and 95.59 % respectively for segmented lung images.
The proposed approach with very high and comparable performance will boost the fast and robust COVID-19
detection using chest X-ray images.

As news organizations embrace transparency practices on their websites to distinguish themselves
from those spreading misinformation, HCI designers have the opportunity to help them effectively
utilize the ideals of transparency to build trust. How can we utilize transparency to promote trust
in news? We examine this question through a qualitative lens by interviewing journalists and news
consumers---the two stakeholders in a news system. We designed a scenario to demonstrate transparency
features using two fundamental news attributes that convey the trustworthiness of a news article:
source and message. In the interviews, our news consumers expressed the idea that news transparency
could be best shown by providing indicators of objectivity in two areas (news selection and framing)
and by providing indicators of evidence in four areas (presence of source materials, anonymous
sourcing, verification, and corrections upon erroneous reporting). While our journalists agreed
with news consumers' suggestions of using evidence indicators, they also suggested additional
transparency indicators in areas such as the news reporting process and personal/organizational
conflicts of interest. Prompted by our scenario, participants offered new design considerations
for building trustworthy news platforms, such as designing for easy comprehension, presenting
appropriate details in news articles (e.g., showing the number and nature of corrections made to
an article), and comparing attributes across news organizations to highlight diverging practices.
Comparing the responses from our two stakeholder groups reveals conflicting suggestions with
trade-offs between them. Our study has implications for HCI designers in building trustworthy
news systems.

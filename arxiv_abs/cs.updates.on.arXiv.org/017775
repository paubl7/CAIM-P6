Over-the-Air (OTA) computation is the problem of computing functions of distributed data without
transmitting the entirety of the data to a central point. By avoiding such costly transmissions,
OTA computation schemes can achieve a better-than-linear (depending on the function, often logarithmic
or even constant) scaling of the communication cost as the number of transmitters grows. Among the
most common functions computed OTA are linear functions such as weighted sums. In this work, we propose
and analyze an analog OTA computation scheme for a class of functions that contains linear functions
as well as some nonlinear functions such as $p$-norms of vectors. We prove error bound guarantees
that are valid for fast-fading channels and all distributions of fading and noise contained in the
class of sub-Gaussian distributions. This class includes Gaussian distributions, but also many
other practically relevant cases such as Class A Middleton noise and fading with dominant line-of-sight
components. In addition, there can be correlations in the fading and noise so that the presented
results also apply to, for example, block fading channels and channels with bursty interference.
We do not rely on any stochastic characterization of the distributed arguments of the OTA computed
function; in particular, there is no assumption that these arguments are drawn from identical or
independent probability distributions. Our analysis is nonasymptotic and therefore provides
error bounds that are valid for a finite number of channel uses. OTA computation has a huge potential
for reducing communication cost in applications such as Machine Learning (ML)-based distributed
anomaly detection in large wireless sensor networks. We illustrate this potential through extensive
numerical simulations.

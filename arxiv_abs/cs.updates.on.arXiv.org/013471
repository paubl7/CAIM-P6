Identifying the direction of emotional influence in a dyadic dialogue is of increasing interest
in the psychological sciences with applications in psychotherapy, analysis of political interactions,
or interpersonal conflict behavior. Facial expressions are widely described as being automatic
and thus hard to overtly influence. As such, they are a perfect measure for a better understanding
of unintentional behavior cues about social-emotional cognitive processes. With this view, this
study is concerned with the analysis of the direction of emotional influence in dyadic dialogue
based on facial expressions only. We exploit computer vision capabilities along with causal inference
theory for quantitative verification of hypotheses on the direction of emotional influence, i.e.,
causal effect relationships, in dyadic dialogues. We address two main issues. First, in a dyadic
dialogue, emotional influence occurs over transient time intervals and with intensity and direction
that are variant over time. To this end, we propose a relevant interval selection approach that we
use prior to causal inference to identify those transient intervals where causal inference should
be applied. Second, we propose to use fine-grained facial expressions that are present when strong
distinct facial emotions are not visible. To specify the direction of influence, we apply the concept
of Granger causality to the time series of facial expressions over selected relevant intervals.
We tested our approach on newly, experimentally obtained data. Based on the quantitative verification
of hypotheses on the direction of emotional influence, we were able to show that the proposed approach
is most promising to reveal the causal effect pattern in various instructed interaction conditions.

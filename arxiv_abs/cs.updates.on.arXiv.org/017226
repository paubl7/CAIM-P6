We present an Expectation-Maximization (EM) Regularized Deep Learning (EMReDL) model for weakly
supervised tumor segmentation. The proposed framework is tailored to glioblastoma, a type of malignant
tumor characterized by its diffuse infiltration into the surrounding brain tissue, which poses
significant challenge to treatment target and tumor burden estimation using conventional structural
MRI. Although physiological MRI provides more specific information regarding tumor infiltration,
the relatively low resolution hinders a precise full annotation. This has motivated us to develop
a weakly supervised deep learning solution that exploits the partial labelled tumor regions. EMReDL
contains two components: a physiological prior prediction model and EM-regularized segmentation
model. The physiological prior prediction model exploits the physiological MRI by training a classifier
to generate a physiological prior map. This map is passed to the segmentation model for regularization
using the EM algorithm. We evaluated the model on a glioblastoma dataset with the pre-operative
multiparametric and recurrence MRI available. EMReDL showed to effectively segment the infiltrated
tumor from the partially labelled region of potential infiltration. The segmented core tumor and
infiltrated tumor demonstrated high consistency with the tumor burden labelled by experts. The
performance comparisons showed that EMReDL achieved higher accuracy than published state-of-the-art
models. On MR spectroscopy, the segmented region displayed more aggressive features than other
partial labelled region. The proposed model can be generalized to other segmentation tasks that
rely on partial labels, with the CNN architecture flexible in the framework.

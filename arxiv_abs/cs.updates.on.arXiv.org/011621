This paper presents the first study in a series of proxemics experiments concerned with the role
of personal spatial zones in human-robot interaction. In the study 40 participants approached
a NAO robot positioned approximately at participants' eye level and entered different social zones
around the robot (personal and intimate space). When the robot perceived the approaching person
entering its personal space, it started gazing at the participant, and upon the intrusion of its
intimate space it leaned back. Our research questions were: (1) given the small size of the robot
(58 cm tall), will people expect its social zones to shrink by its size? (2) Will the robot behaviors
be interpreted as appropriate social behaviors? We found that the average approach distance of
the participants was 48 cm, which represents the inner limit of the human-size personal zone (45-120
cm), but is outside of the personal zone scaled to robot size (16-42 cm). This suggests that most participants
did not (fully) scale down the extent of these zones to the robot size. We also found that the leaning
back behavior of the robot was correctly interpreted by most participants as the robot's reaction
to the intrusion of its personal space; however, our implementation of the behavior was often perceived
as "unfriendly". We will discuss this and other limitations of the study in detail. Additionally
we found positive correlations between participants' personality traits, Godspeed Questionnaire
subscales, and the average approach distance. The technical contribution of this work is the real-time
perception of 25 keypoints on the human body using a single compact RGB-D camera and the use of these
points for accurate interpersonal distance estimation and as gazing targets for the robot.

The state-of-the-art driving automation system demands extreme computational resources to meet
rigorous accuracy and latency requirements. Though emerging driving automation computing platforms
are based on ASIC to provide better performance and power guarantee, building such an accelerator-based
computing platform for driving automation still present challenges. First, the workloads mix
and performance requirements exposed to driving automation system present significant variability.
Second, with more cameras/sensors integrated in a future fully autonomous driving vehicle, a heterogeneous
multi-accelerator architecture substrate is needed that requires a design space exploration
for a new form of parallelism. In this work, we aim to extensively explore the above system design
challenges and these challenges motivate us to propose a comprehensive framework that synergistically
handles the heterogeneous hardware accelerator design principles, system design criteria, and
task scheduling mechanism. Specifically, we propose a novel heterogeneous multi-core AI accelerator
(HMAI) to provide the hardware substrate for the driving automation tasks with variability. We
also define system design criteria to better utilize hardware resources and achieve increased
throughput while satisfying the performance and energy restrictions. Finally, we propose a deep
reinforcement learning (RL)-based task scheduling mechanism FlexAI, to resolve task mapping
issue. Experimental results show that with FlexAI scheduling, basically 100% tasks in each driving
route can be processed by HMAI within their required period to ensure safety, and FlexAI can also
maximally reduce the breaking distance up to 96% as compared to typical heuristics and guided random-search-based
algorithms.

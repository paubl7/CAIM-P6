Machine learning is completely changing the trends in the fashion industry. From big to small every
brand is using machine learning techniques in order to improve their revenue, increase customers
and stay ahead of the trend. People are into fashion and they want to know what looks best and how they
can improve their style and elevate their personality. Using Deep learning technology and infusing
it with Computer Vision techniques one can do so by utilizing Brain-inspired Deep Networks, and
engaging into Neuroaesthetics, working with GANs and Training them, playing around with Unstructured
Data,and infusing the transformer architecture are just some highlights which can be touched with
the Fashion domain. Its all about designing a system that can tell us information regarding the fashion
aspect that can come in handy with the ever growing demand. Personalization is a big factor that impacts
the spending choices of customers.The survey also shows remarkable approaches that encroach the
subject of achieving that by divulging deep into how visual data can be interpreted and leveraged
into different models and approaches. Aesthetics play a vital role in clothing recommendation
as users' decision depends largely on whether the clothing is in line with their aesthetics, however
the conventional image features cannot portray this directly. For that the survey also highlights
remarkable models like tensor factorization model, conditional random field model among others
to cater the need to acknowledge aesthetics as an important factor in Apparel recommendation.These
AI inspired deep models can pinpoint exactly which certain style resonates best with their customers
and they can have an understanding of how the new designs will set in with the community. With AI and
machine learning your businesses can stay ahead of the fashion trends.

Salient object detection (SOD) is a long-standing research topic in computer vision and has drawn
an increasing amount of research interest in the past decade. This paper provides the first comprehensive
review and benchmark for SOD on light field, which has long been lacking in the saliency community.
Firstly, we introduce the preliminary knowledge of light field including theory and data forms,
and then review existing studies on light field SOD, covering ten traditional models, six deep learning-based
models, one comparative study, and one brief review. Existing datasets for light field SOD are summarized
with detailed information and statistical analysis. Secondly, we benchmark seven representative
light field SOD models together with several cutting-edge RGB-D SOD models on four widely used light
field datasets, from which insightful discussions and analyses including the comparison between
light field SOD and RGB-D SOD models are achieved. Besides, due to the inconsistency of datasets
in their current forms, we further generate complete data and supplement focal stacks, depth maps
and multi-view images for the inconsistent datasets, making them consistent and unified. Our supplemented
data makes a universal benchmark possible. Lastly, because light field SOD is a quite special problem
attributed to its diverse data representations and high dependency on acquisition hardware, making
it differ greatly from other saliency detection tasks, we provide nine hints into the challenges
and future directions, and outline several open issues. We hope our review and benchmarking could
serve as a catalyst to advance research in this field. All the materials including collected models,
datasets, benchmarking results, and supplemented light field datasets will be publicly available
at our project site.

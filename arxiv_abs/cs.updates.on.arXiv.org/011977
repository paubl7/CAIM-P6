Cybersecurity tools are increasingly automated with artificial intelligent (AI) capabilities
to match the exponential scale of attacks, compensate for the relatively slower rate of training
new cybersecurity talents, and improve of the accuracy and performance of both tools and users.
However, the safe and appropriate usage of autonomous cyber attack tools - especially at the development
stages for these tools - is still largely an unaddressed gap. Our survey of current literature and
tools showed that most of the existing cyber range designs are mostly using manual tools and have
not considered augmenting automated tools or the potential security issues caused by the tools.
In other words, there is still room for a novel cyber range design which allow security researchers
to safely deploy autonomous tools and perform automated tool testing if needed. In this paper, we
introduce Pandora, a safe testing environment which allows security researchers and cyber range
users to perform experiments on automated cyber attack tools that may have strong potential of usage
and at the same time, a strong potential for risks. Unlike existing testbeds and cyber ranges which
have direct compatibility with enterprise computer systems and the potential for risk propagation
across the enterprise network, our test system is intentionally designed to be incompatible with
enterprise real-world computing systems to reduce the risk of attack propagation into actual infrastructure.
Our design also provides a tool to convert in-development automated cyber attack tools into to executable
test binaries for validation and usage realistic enterprise system environments if required.
Our experiments tested automated attack tools on our proposed system to validate the usability
of our proposed environment. Our experiments also proved the safety of our environment by compatibility
testing using simple malicious code.

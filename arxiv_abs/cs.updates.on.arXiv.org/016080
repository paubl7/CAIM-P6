Objective Although social and environmental factors are central to provider patient interactions,
the data that reflect these factors can be incomplete, vague, and subjective. We sought to create
a conceptual framework to describe and classify data about presence, the domain of interpersonal
connection in medicine. Methods Our top down approach for ontology development based on the concept
of relationality included 1) broad survey of social sciences literature and systematic literature
review of more than 20,000 articles around interpersonal connection in medicine, 3) relational
ethnography of clinical encounters (5 pilot, 27 full) and 4) interviews about relational work with
40 medical and nonmedical professionals. We formalized the model using the Web Ontology Language
in the Protege ontology editor. We iteratively evaluated and refined the Presence Ontology through
manual expert review and automated annotation of literature. Results and Discussion The Presence
Ontology facilitates the naming and classification of concepts that would otherwise be vague.
Our model categorizes contributors to healthcare encounters and factors such as Communication,
Emotions, Tools, and Environment. Ontology evaluation indicated that Cognitive Models (both
patients explanatory models and providers caregiving approaches) influenced encounters and
were subsequently incorporated. We show how ethnographic methods based in relationality can aid
the representation of experiential concepts (e.g., empathy, trust). Our ontology could support
informatics applications to improve healthcare such annotation of videotaped encounters, clinical
instruments to measure presence, or EHR based reminders for providers. Conclusion The Presence
Ontology provides a model for using ethnographic approaches to classify interpersonal data.

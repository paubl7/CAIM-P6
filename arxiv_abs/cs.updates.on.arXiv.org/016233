Cytology is a low-cost and non-invasive diagnostic procedure employed to support the diagnosis
of a broad range of pathologies. Computer Vision technologies, by automatically generating quantitative
and objective descriptions of examinations' contents, can help minimize the chances of misdiagnoses
and shorten the time required for analysis. To identify the state-of-art of computer vision techniques
currently applied to cytology, we conducted a Systematic Literature Review. We analyzed papers
published in the last 5 years. The initial search was executed in September 2020 and resulted in 431
articles. After applying the inclusion/exclusion criteria, 157 papers remained, which we analyzed
to build a picture of the tendencies and problems present in this research area, highlighting the
computer vision methods, staining techniques, evaluation metrics, and the availability of the
used datasets and computer code. As a result, we identified that the most used methods in the analyzed
works are deep learning-based (70 papers), while fewer works employ classic computer vision only
(101 papers). The most recurrent metric used for classification and object detection was the accuracy
(33 papers and 5 papers), while for segmentation it was the Dice Similarity Coefficient (38 papers).
Regarding staining techniques, Papanicolaou was the most employed one (130 papers), followed
by H&E (20 papers) and Feulgen (5 papers). Twelve of the datasets used in the papers are publicly available,
with the DTU/Herlev dataset being the most used one. We conclude that there still is a lack of high-quality
datasets for many types of stains and most of the works are not mature enough to be applied in a daily
clinical diagnostic routine. We also identified a growing tendency towards adopting deep learning-based
approaches as the methods of choice.

In this paper, we investigate the recommendation task in the most common scenario with implicit
feedback (e.g., clicks, purchases). State-of-the-art methods in this direction usually cast
the problem as to learn a personalized ranking on a set of items (e.g., webpages, products). The top-N
results are then provided to users as recommendations, where the N is usually a fixed number pre-defined
by the system according to some heuristic criteria (e.g., page size, screen size). There is one major
assumption underlying this fixed-number recommendation scheme, i.e., there are always sufficient
relevant items to users' preferences. Unfortunately, this assumption may not always hold in real-world
scenarios. In some applications, there might be very limited candidate items to recommend, and
some users may have very high relevance requirement in recommendation. In this way, even the top-1
ranked item may not be relevant to a user's preference. Therefore, we argue that it is critical to
provide a dynamic-K recommendation, where the K should be different with respect to the candidate
item set and the target user. We formulate this dynamic-K recommendation task as a joint learning
problem with both ranking and classification objectives. The ranking objective is the same as existing
methods, i.e., to create a ranking list of items according to users' interests. The classification
objective is unique in this work, which aims to learn a personalized decision boundary to differentiate
the relevant items from irrelevant items. Based on these ideas, we extend two state-of-the-art
ranking-based recommendation methods, i.e., BPRMF and HRM, to the corresponding dynamic-K versions,
namely DK-BPRMF and DK-HRM. Our experimental results on two datasets show that the dynamic-K models
are more effective than the original fixed-N recommendation methods.

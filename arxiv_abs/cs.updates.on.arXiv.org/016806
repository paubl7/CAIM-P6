The huge amount of data made available by the massive usage of social media has opened up the unprecedented
possibility to carry out a data-driven study of political processes. While particular attention
has been paid to phenomena like elite and mass polarization during online debates and echo-chambers
formation, the interplay between online partisanship and framing practices, jointly sustaining
adversarial dynamics, still remains overlooked. With the present paper, we carry out a socio-semantic
analysis of the debate about migration policies observed on the Italian Twittersphere, across
the period May-November 2019. As regards the social analysis, our methodology allows us to extract
relevant information about the political orientation of the communities of users - hereby called
partisan communities - without resorting upon any external information. Remarkably, our community
detection technique is sensitive enough to clearly highlight the dynamics characterizing the
relationship among different political forces.As regards the semantic analysis, our networks
of hashtags display a mesoscale structure organized in a core-periphery fashion, across the entire
observation period. Taken altogether, our results point at different, yet overlapping, trajectories
of conflict played out using migration issues as a backdrop. A first line opposes communities discussing
substantively of migration to communities approaching this issue just to fuel hostility against
political opponents; within the second line, a mechanism of distancing between partisan communities
reflects shifting political alliances within the governmental coalition. Ultimately, our results
contribute to shed light on the complexity of the Italian political context characterized by multiple
poles of partisan alignment.

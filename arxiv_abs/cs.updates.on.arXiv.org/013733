OODIDA (On-board/Off-board Distributed Data Analytics) is a platform for distributed real-time
analytics, targeting fleets of reference vehicles in the automotive industry. Its users are data
analysts. The bulk of the data analytics tasks are performed by clients (on-board), while a central
cloud server performs supplementary tasks (off-board). OODIDA can be automatically packaged
and deployed, which necessitates restarting parts of the system, or all of it. As this is potentially
disruptive, we added the ability to execute user-defined Python modules on clients as well as the
server. These modules can be replaced without restarting any part of the system; they can even be
replaced between iterations of an ongoing assignment. This feature is referred to as active-code
replacement. It facilitates use cases such as iterative A/B testing of machine learning algorithms
or modifying experimental algorithms on-the-fly. Consistency of results is achieved by majority
vote, which prevents tainted state. Active-code replacement can be done in less than a second in
an idealized setting whereas a standard deployment takes many orders of magnitude more time. The
main contribution of this paper is the description of a relatively straightforward approach to
active-code replacement that is very user-friendly. It enables a data analyst to quickly execute
custom code on the cloud server as well as on client devices. Sensible safeguards and design decisions
ensure that this feature can be used by non-specialists who are not familiar with the implementation
of OODIDA in general or this feature in particular. As a consequence of adding the active-code replacement
feature, OODIDA is now very well-suited for rapid prototyping.

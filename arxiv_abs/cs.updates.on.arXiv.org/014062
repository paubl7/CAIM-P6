Insurers are increasingly adopting more demand-based strategies to incorporate the indirect
effect of premium changes on their policyholders' willingness to stay. However, since in practice
both insurers' renewal premia and customers' responses to these premia typically depend on the
customer's level of risk, it remains challenging in these strategies to determine how to properly
control for this confounding. We therefore consider a causal inference approach in this paper to
account for customer price sensitivities and to deduce optimal, multi-period profit maximizing
premium renewal offers. More specifically, we extend the discrete treatment framework of Guelman
and Guill\'en (2014) by Extreme Gradient Boosting, or XGBoost, and by multiple imputation to better
account for the uncertainty in the counterfactual responses. We additionally introduce the continuous
treatment framework with XGBoost to the insurance literature to allow identification of the exact
optimal renewal offers and account for any competition in the market by including competitor offers.
The application of the two treatment frameworks to a Dutch automobile insurance portfolio suggests
that a policy's competitiveness in the market is crucial for a customer's price sensitivity and
that XGBoost is more appropriate to describe this than the traditional logistic regression. Moreover,
an efficient frontier of both frameworks indicates that substantially more profit can be gained
on the portfolio than realized, also already with less churn and in particular if we allow for continuous
rate changes. A multi-period renewal optimization confirms these findings and demonstrates that
the competitiveness enables temporal feedback of previous rate changes on future demand.

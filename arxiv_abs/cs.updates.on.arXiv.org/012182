The influence maximization paradigm has been used by researchers in various fields in order to study
how information spreads in social networks. While previously the attention was mostly on efficiency,
more recently fairness issues have been taken into account in this scope. In this paper, we propose
to use randomization as a mean for achieving fairness. Similar to previous works like Fish et al.
(WWW '19) and Tsang et al. (IJCAI '19), we study the maximin criterion for (group) fairness. In contrast
to their work however, we model the problem in such a way that, when choosing the seed sets, probabilistic
strategies are possible rather than only deterministic ones. We introduce two different variants
of this probabilistic problem, one that entails probabilistic strategies over nodes (node-based
problem) and a second one that entails probabilistic strategies over sets of nodes (set-based problem).
While the original deterministic problem involving the maximin criterion has been shown to be inapproximable,
interestingly, we show that both probabilistic variants permit approximation algorithms that
achieve a constant multiplicative factor of 1-1/e plus an additive arbitrarily small error that
is due to the simulation of the information spread. For an experimental study, we provide implementations
of multiplicative-weight routines for both problems and compare the achieved fairness values
to existing methods. Maybe non-surprisingly, we show that the ex-ante values of the computed probabilistic
strategies are significantly larger than the (ex-post) fairness values of previous methods. This
indicates that studying fairness via randomization is a worthwhile path to follow. Interestingly
and maybe more surprisingly, we observe that even the ex-post fairness values computed by our routines,
dominate over the fairness achieved by previous methods on most of the instances tested.

Objective: Temporal electronic health records (EHRs) can be a wealth of information for secondary
uses, such as clinical events prediction or chronic disease management. However, challenges exist
for temporal data representation. We therefore sought to identify these challenges and evaluate
novel methodologies for addressing them through a systematic examination of deep learning solutions.
Methods: We searched five databases (PubMed, EMBASE, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics
Engineers [IEEE] Xplore Digital Library, the Association for Computing Machinery [ACM] digital
library, and Web of Science) complemented with hand-searching in several prestigious computer
science conference proceedings. We sought articles that reported deep learning methodologies
on temporal data representation in structured EHR data from January 1, 2010, to August 30, 2020.
We summarized and analyzed the selected articles from three perspectives: nature of time series,
methodology, and model implementation. Results: We included 98 articles related to temporal data
representation using deep learning. Four major challenges were identified, including data irregularity,
data heterogeneity, data sparsity, and model opacity. We then studied how deep learning techniques
were applied to address these challenges. Finally, we discuss some open challenges arising from
deep learning. Conclusion: Temporal EHR data present several major challenges for clinical prediction
modeling and data utilization. To some extent, current deep learning solutions can address these
challenges. Future studies can consider designing comprehensive and integrated solutions. Moreover,
researchers should incorporate additional clinical domain knowledge into study designs and enhance
the interpretability of the model to facilitate its implementation in clinical practice.

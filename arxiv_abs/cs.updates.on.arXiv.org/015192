Sampling-Based Optimal(SBO) path planning has been mainly used for robotic arm manipulation tasks.
Several research works have been carried out in order to evaluate performances of various SBO planners
for arm manipulation. However, not much of work is available that highlights performances of SBO
planners in context of mobile robot navigation in outdoor 3D environments. This paper evaluates
performances of major SBO planners in Open Motion Planning Library(OMPL) for that purpose. Due
to large number of existing SBO planners, experimenting and selecting a proper planner for a planning
problem can be burdensome and ambiguous. SBO planner's probabilistic nature can also add a bias
to this procedure. To address this, we evaluate performances of all available SBO planners in OMPL
with a randomized planning problem generation method iteratively. Evaluations are done in various
state spaces suiting for different differential constraints of mobile robots. The planning setups
are focused for navigation of mobile robots in outdoor environments. The outdoor environment representation
is done with prebuilt OctoMaps, collision checks are performed between a 3D box representing robot
body and OctoMap for validation of sampled states. Several evaluation metrics such as resulting
path's length, smoothness and status of acquired final solutions are selected. According to selected
metrics, performances from different SBO planners are presented comparatively. Experimental
results shows the significance of parallel computing towards quicker convergence rates for optimal
solutions. Several SBO methods that takes advantage of parallel computing produced better results
consistently in all state spaces for different planning inquiries.

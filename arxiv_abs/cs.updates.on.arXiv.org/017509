Proportional-integral-derivative (PID) control, the most common control strategy in the industry,
always suffers from health problems resulting from external disturbances, improper tuning, etc.
Therefore, there have been many studies on control performance assessment (CPA) and optimal tuning.
Minimum output variance (MOV) is used as a benchmark for CPA of PID, but it is difficult to be found
due to the associated non-convex optimization problem. For the optimal tuning, many different
objective functions have been proposed, but few consider the stochastic disturbance rejection.
In this paper, a multi-objective function simultaneously considering integral of absolute error
(IAE) and MOV is proposed to optimize PID for better disturbance rejection. The non-convex problem
and multi-objective problem are solved by teaching-learning-based optimization (TLBO). This
stochastic optimization algorithm can guarantee a tighter lower bound for MOV due to the excellent
capability of local optima avoidance and needs less calculation time due to the low complexity.
Furthermore, CPA and the tuning method are extended to the PI/P cascade case. The results of several
numerical examples of CPA problems show that TLBO can generate better MOV than existing methods
within one second on most examples. The simulation results of the tuning method applied to two temperature
control systems reveal that the weight of the multi-objective function can compromise other performance
criteria such as overshoot and settling time to improve the disturbance rejection. It also indicates
that the tuning method can be utilized to multi-stage PID control strategy to resolve the contradiction
between disturbance rejection and other performance criteria.

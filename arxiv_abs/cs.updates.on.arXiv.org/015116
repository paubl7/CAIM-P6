Semantic segmentation, which refers to pixel-wise classification of an image, is a fundamental
topic in computer vision owing to its growing importance in robot vision and autonomous driving
industries. It provides rich information about objects in the scene such as object boundary, category,
and location. Recent methods for semantic segmentation often employ an encoder-decoder structure
using deep convolutional neural networks. The encoder part extracts feature of the image using
several filters and pooling operations, whereas the decoder part gradually recovers the low-resolution
feature maps of the encoder into a full input resolution feature map for pixel-wise prediction.
However, the encoder-decoder variants for semantic segmentation suffer from severe spatial information
loss, caused by pooling operations or convolutions with stride, and does not consider the context
in the scene. In this paper, we propose a dense upsampling convolution method based on guided filtering
to effectively preserve the spatial information of the image in the network. We further propose
a novel local context convolution method that not only covers larger-scale objects in the scene
but covers them densely for precise object boundary delineation. Theoretical analyses and experimental
results on several benchmark datasets verify the effectiveness of our method. Qualitatively,
our approach delineates object boundaries at a level of accuracy that is beyond the current excellent
methods. Quantitatively, we report a new record of 82.86% and 81.62% of pixel accuracy on ADE20K
and Pascal-Context benchmark datasets, respectively. In comparison with the state-of-the-art
methods, the proposed method offers promising improvements.

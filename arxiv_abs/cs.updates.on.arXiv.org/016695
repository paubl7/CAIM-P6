The current trends towards vehicle-sharing, electrification, and autonomy are predicted to transform
mobility. Combined appropriately, they have the potential of significantly improving urban mobility.
However, what will come after most vehicles are shared, electric, and autonomous remains an open
question, especially regarding the interactions between vehicles and how these interactions
will impact system-level behaviour. Inspired by nature and supported by swarm robotics and vehicle
platooning models, this paper proposes a future mobility in which shared, electric, and autonomous
vehicles behave as a bio-inspired collaborative system. The collaboration between vehicles will
lead to a system-level behaviour analogous to natural swarms. Natural swarms can divide tasks,
cluster, build together, or transport cooperatively. In this future mobility, vehicles will cluster
by connecting either physically or virtually, which will enable the possibility of sharing energy,
data or computational power, provide services or transfer cargo, among others. Vehicles will collaborate
either with vehicles that are part of the same fleet, or with any other vehicle on the road, by finding
mutualistic relationships that benefit both parties. The field of swarm robotics has already translated
some of the behaviours from natural swarms to artificial systems and, if we further translate these
concepts into urban mobility, exciting ideas emerge. Within mobility-related research, the coordinated
movement proposed in vehicle platooning models can be seen as a first step towards collaborative
mobility. This paper contributes with the proposal of a framework for future mobility that integrates
current research and mobility trends in a novel and unique way.

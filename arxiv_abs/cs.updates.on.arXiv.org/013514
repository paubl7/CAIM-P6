COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory infection that has affected a large population across
the world and continues with its devastating consequences. It is imperative to detect COVID-19
at the earliest to limit the span of infection. In this work, a new classification technique CB-STM-RENet
based on deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Channel Boosting is proposed for the screening
of COVID-19 in chest X-Rays. In this connection, to learn the COVID-19 specific radiographic patterns,
a new convolution block based on split-transform-merge (STM) is developed. This new block systematically
incorporates region and edge-based operations at each branch to capture the diverse set of features
at various levels, especially those related to region homogeneity, textural variations, and boundaries
of the infected region. The learning and discrimination capability of the proposed CNN architecture
is enhanced by exploiting the Channel Boosting idea that concatenates the auxiliary channels along
with the original channels. The auxiliary channels are generated from the pre-trained CNNs using
Transfer Learning. The effectiveness of the proposed technique CB-STM-RENet is evaluated on three
different datasets of chest X-Rays namely CoV-Healthy-6k, CoV-NonCoV-10k, and CoV-NonCoV-15k.
The performance comparison of the proposed CB-STM-RENet with the existing techniques exhibits
high performance both in discriminating COVID-19 chest infections from Healthy, as well as, other
types of chest infections. CB-STM-RENet provides the highest performance on all these three datasets;
especially on the stringent CoV-NonCoV-15k dataset. The good detection rate (97%), and high precision
(93%) of the proposed technique suggest that it can be adapted for the diagnosis of COVID-19 infected
patients. The test code is available at https://github.com/PRLAB21/COVID-19-Detection-System-using-Chest-X-Ray-Images.

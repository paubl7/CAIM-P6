Contextuality is a key signature of quantum non-classicality, which has been shown to play a central
role in enabling quantum advantage for a wide range of information-processing and computational
tasks. We study the logic of contextuality from a structural point of view, in the setting of partial
Boolean algebras introduced by Kochen and Specker in their seminal work. These contrast with traditional
quantum logic \`a la Birkhoff and von Neumann in that operations such as conjunction and disjunction
are partial, only being defined in the domain where they are physically meaningful. We study how
this setting relates to current work on contextuality such as the sheaf-theoretic and graph-theoretic
approaches. We introduce a general free construction extending the commeasurability relation
on a partial Boolean algebra, i.e. the domain of definition of the binary logical operations. This
construction has a surprisingly broad range of uses. We apply it in the study of a number of issues,
including: - establishing the connection between the abstract measurement scenarios studied
in the contextuality literature and the setting of partial Boolean algebras; - formulating various
contextuality properties in this setting, including probabilistic contextuality as well as the
strong, state-independent notion of contextuality given by Kochen-Specker paradoxes, which
are logically contradictory statements validated by partial Boolean algebras, specifically
those arising from quantum mechanics; - investigating a Logical Exclusivity Principle, and its
relation to the Probabilistic Exclusivity Principle widely studied in recent work on contextuality
as a step towards closing in on the set of quantum-realisable correlations; - developing some work
towards a logical presentation of the Hilbert space tensor product, using logical exclusivity
to capture some of its salient quantum features.

An important problem in terrain analysis is modeling how water flows across a terrain creating floods
by forming channels and filling depressions. In this paper we study a number of \emph{flow-query}
related problems: Given a terrain $\Sigma$, represented as a triangulated $xy$-monotone surface
with $n$ vertices, a rain distribution $R$ which may vary over time, determine how much water is flowing
over a given edge as a function of time. We develop internal-memory as well as I/O-efficient algorithms
for flow queries. This paper contains four main results: (i) We present an internal-memory algorithm
that preprocesses $\Sigma$ into a linear-size data structure that for a (possibly time varying)
rain distribution $R$ can return the flow-rate functions of all edges of $\Sigma$ in $O(\rho k+|\phi|
\log n)$ time, where $\rho$ is the number of sinks in $\Sigma$, $k$ is the number of times the rain distribution
changes, and $|\phi|$ is the total complexity of the flow-rate functions that have non-zero values;
(ii) We also present an I/O-efficient algorithm for preprocessing $\Sigma$ into a linear-size
data structure so that for a rain distribution $R$, it can compute the flow-rate function of all edges
using $O(\text{Sort}(|\phi|))$ I/Os and $O(|\phi| \log |\phi|)$ internal computation time.
(iii) $\Sigma$ can be preprocessed into a linear-size data structure so that for a given rain distribution
$R$, the flow-rate function of an edge $(q,r) \in \Sigma$ under the single-flow direction (SFD)
model can be computed more efficiently. (iv) We present an algorithm for computing the two-dimensional
channel along which water flows using Manning's equation; a widely used empirical equation that
relates the flow-rate of water in an open channel to the geometry of the channel along with the height
of water in the channel.

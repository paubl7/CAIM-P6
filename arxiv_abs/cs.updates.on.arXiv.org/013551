Large machine learning models based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with rapidly increasing
number of parameters, trained with massive amounts of data, are being deployed in a wide array of
computer vision tasks from self-driving cars to medical imaging. The insatiable demand for computing
resources required to train these models is fast outpacing the advancement of classical computing
hardware, and new frameworks including Optical Neural Networks (ONNs) and quantum computing are
being explored as future alternatives. In this work, we report a novel quantum computing based deep
learning model, the Quantum Optical Convolutional Neural Network (QOCNN), to alleviate the computational
bottleneck in future computer vision applications. Using the popular MNIST dataset, we have benchmarked
this new architecture against a traditional CNN based on the seminal LeNet model. We have also compared
the performance with previously reported ONNs, namely the GridNet and ComplexNet, as well as a Quantum
Optical Neural Network (QONN) that we built by combining the ComplexNet with quantum based sinusoidal
nonlinearities. In essence, our work extends the prior research on QONN by adding quantum convolution
and pooling layers preceding it. We have evaluated all the models by determining their accuracies,
confusion matrices, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, and Matthews Correlation
Coefficients. The performance of the models were similar overall, and the ROC curves indicated
that the new QOCNN model is robust. Finally, we estimated the gains in computational efficiencies
from executing this novel framework on a quantum computer. We conclude that switching to a quantum
computing based approach to deep learning may result in comparable accuracies to classical models,
while achieving unprecedented boosts in computational performances and drastic reduction in
power consumption.

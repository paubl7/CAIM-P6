Multiscale models of materials, consisting of upscaling discrete simulations to continuum models,
are unique in their capability to simulate complex materials behavior. The fundamental limitation
in multiscale models is the presence of uncertainty in the computational predictions delivered
by them. In this work, a sequential multiscale model has been developed, incorporating discrete
dislocation dynamics (DDD) simulations and a strain gradient plasticity (SGP) model to predict
the size effect in plastic deformations of metallic micro-pillars. The DDD simulations include
uniaxial compression of micro-pillars with different sizes and over a wide range of initial dislocation
densities and spatial distributions of dislocations. An SGP model is employed at the continuum
level that accounts for the size-dependency of flow stress and hardening rate. Sequences of uncertainty
analyses have been performed to assess the predictive capability of the multiscale model. The variance-based
global sensitivity analysis determines the effect of parameter uncertainty on the SGP model prediction.
The multiscale model is then constructed by calibrating the continuum model using the data furnished
by the DDD simulations. A Bayesian calibration method is implemented to quantify the uncertainty
due to microstructural randomness in discrete dislocation simulations (density and spatial distributions
of dislocations) on the macroscopic continuum model prediction (size effect in plastic deformation).
The outcomes of this study indicate that the discrete-continuum multiscale model can accurately
simulate the plastic deformation of micro-pillars, despite the significant uncertainty in the
DDD results. Additionally, depending on the macroscopic features represented by the DDD simulations,
the SGP model can reliably predict the size effect in plasticity responses of the micropillars with
below 10% of error

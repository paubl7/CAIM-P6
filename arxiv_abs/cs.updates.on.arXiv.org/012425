Mining frequent episodes aims at recovering sequential patterns from temporal data sequences,
which can then be used to predict the occurrence of related events in advance. On the other hand, gradual
patterns that capture co-variation of complex attributes in the form of " when X increases/decreases,
Y increases/decreases" play an important role in many real world applications where huge volumes
of complex numerical data must be handled. Recently, these patterns have received attention from
the data mining community exploring temporal data who proposed methods to automatically extract
gradual patterns from temporal data. However, to the best of our knowledge, no method has been proposed
to extract gradual patterns that regularly appear at identical time intervals in many sequences
of temporal data, despite the fact that such patterns may add knowledge to certain applications,
such as e-commerce. In this paper, we propose to extract co-variations of periodically repeating
attributes from the sequences of temporal data that we call seasonal gradual patterns. For this
purpose, we formulate the task of mining seasonal gradual patterns as the problem of mining periodic
patterns in multiple sequences and then we exploit periodic pattern mining algorithms to extract
seasonal gradual patterns. We discuss specific features of these patterns and propose an approach
for their extraction based on mining periodic frequent patterns common to multiple sequences.
We also propose a new anti-monotonous support definition associated to these seasonal gradual
patterns. The illustrative results obtained from some real world data sets show that the proposed
approach is efficient and that it can extract small sets of patterns by filtering numerous nonseasonal
patterns to identify the seasonal ones.

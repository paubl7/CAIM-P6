The problem of optimization of the rolling dynamics model is considered. That providing safe movement
at high frequency when interacting with the railway. Moreover, allowing to evaluate the dynamic
parameters when designing new and modernizing existing locomotives. The object of this research
is a rail transport dynamic system model. The article's purpose is to increase the efficiency of
the digital hardware in the rolling stock loop model by optimizing the organization of the computing
process. The mathematical model analysis of the object made it possible to attribute it to the class
of hard real-time systems. The computation of the model phase variables with different frequencies
is necessary to optimize the simulation time of the train movements and is performed by splitting
the original algorithm into parallel threads. The developed planning algorithm and the cyclic
schedule implementation for the model of a dynamic real-time object consider microarchitecture
solutions of symmetric multiprocessor systems with shared memory and methods for optimizing software
tools. The experiments confirmed the operability of the optimized model. Also, allow us to recommend
it for practical use in studying objects and determine the dynamic force of trolley structural elements
during operation. Analysis of the optimized model simulation results, using cyclic schedules
shows the correspondence of the obtained simulation results to the standard. The main advantage
of the model is the increase in productivity when performing data processing by reducing the processor
time. The optimized cyclic schedule algorithm of the semi-natural modeling platform is used for
the subsequent development of the control system in real and accelerated time scales.

Intelligent city transportation systems are one of the core infrastructures of a smart city. The
true ingenuity of such an infrastructure lies in providing the commuters with real-time information
about citywide transports like public buses, allowing her to pre-plan the travel. However, providing
prior information for transportation systems like public buses in real-time is inherently challenging
because of the diverse nature of different stay-locations that a public bus stops. Although straightforward
factors stay duration, extracted from unimodal sources like GPS, at these locations look erratic,
a thorough analysis of public bus GPS trails for 720km of bus travels at the city of Durgapur, a semi-urban
city in India, reveals that several other fine-grained contextual features can characterize these
locations accurately. Accordingly, we develop BuStop, a system for extracting and characterizing
the stay locations from multi-modal sensing using commuters' smartphones. Using this multi-modal
information BuStop extracts a set of granular contextual features that allow the system to differentiate
among the different stay-location types. A thorough analysis of BuStop using the collected dataset
indicates that the system works with high accuracy in identifying different stay locations like
regular bus stops, random ad-hoc stops, stops due to traffic congestion stops at traffic signals,
and stops at sharp turns. Additionally, we also develop a proof-of-concept setup on top of BuStop
to analyze the potential of the framework in predicting expected arrival time, a critical piece
of information required to pre-plan travel, at any given bus stop. Subsequent analysis of the PoC
framework, through simulation over the test dataset, shows that characterizing the stay-locations
indeed helps make more accurate arrival time predictions with deviations less than 60s from the
ground-truth arrival time.

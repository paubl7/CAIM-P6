In this paper, we address the problem of autonomous multi-robot mapping, exploration and navigation
in unknown, GPS-denied indoor or urban environments using a swarm of robots equipped with directional
sensors with limited sensing capabilities and limited computational resources. The robots have
no a priori knowledge of the environment and need to rapidly explore and construct a map in a distributed
manner using existing landmarks, the presence of which can be detected using onboard senors, although
little to no metric information (distance or bearing to the landmarks) is available. In order to
correctly and effectively achieve this, the presence of a necessary density/distribution of landmarks
is ensured by design of the urban/indoor environment. We thus address this problem in two phases:
1) During the design/construction of the urban/indoor environment we can ensure that sufficient
landmarks are placed within the environment. To that end we develop a filtration-based approach
for designing strategic placement of landmarks in an environment. 2) We develop a distributed algorithm
using which a team of robots, with no a priori knowledge of the environment, can explore such an environment,
construct a topological map requiring no metric/distance information, and use that map to navigate
within the environment. This is achieved using a topological representation of the environment
(called a Landmark Complex), instead of constructing a complete metric/pixel map. The representation
is built by the robot as well as used by them for navigation through a balance between exploration
and exploitation. We use tools from homology theory for identifying "holes" in the coverage/exploration
of the unknown environment and hence guiding the robots towards achieving a complete exploration
and mapping of the environment.

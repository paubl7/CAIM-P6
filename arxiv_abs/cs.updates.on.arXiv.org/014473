As the COVID-19 pandemic emerged in early 2020, a number of malicious actors have started capitalizing
the topic. Although a few media reports mentioned the existence of coronavirus-themed mobile malware,
the research community lacks the understanding of the landscape of the coronavirus-themed mobile
malware. In this paper, we present the first systematic study of coronavirus-themed Android malware.
We first make efforts to create a daily growing COVID-19 themed mobile app dataset, which contains
4,322 COVID-19 themed apk samples (2,500 unique apps) and 611 potential malware samples (370 unique
malicious apps) by the time of mid-November, 2020. We then present an analysis of them from multiple
perspectives including trends and statistics, installation methods, malicious behaviors and
malicious actors behind them. We observe that the COVID-19 themed apps as well as malicious ones
began to flourish almost as soon as the pandemic broke out worldwide. Most malicious apps are camouflaged
as benign apps using the same app identifiers (e.g., app name, package name and app icon). Their main
purposes are either stealing users' private information or making profit by using tricks like phishing
and extortion. Furthermore, only a quarter of the COVID-19 malware creators are habitual developers
who have been active for a long time, while 75% of them are newcomers in this pandemic. The malicious
developers are mainly located in US, mostly targeting countries including English-speaking countries,
China, Arabic countries and Europe. To facilitate future research, we have publicly released all
the well-labelled COVID-19 themed apps (and malware) to the research community. Till now, over
30 research institutes around the world have requested our dataset for COVID-19 themed research.

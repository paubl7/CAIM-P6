Departing from the postulate that Voynich Manuscript is not a hoax but rather encodes authentic
contents, our article presents an evolutionary algorithm which aims to find the most optimal mapping
between voynichian glyphs and candidate phonemic values. Core component of the decoding algorithm
is a process of maximization of a fitness function which aims to find most optimal set of substitution
rules allowing to transcribe the part of the manuscript -- which we call the Calendar -- into lists
of feminine names. This leads to sets of character subsitution rules which allow us to consistently
transcribe dozens among three hundred calendar tokens into feminine names: a result far surpassing
both ``popular'' as well as "state of the art" tentatives to crack the manuscript. What's more, by
using name lists stemming from different languages as potential cribs, our ``adaptive'' method
can also be useful in identification of the language in which the manuscript is written. As far as
we can currently tell, results of our experiments indicate that the Calendar part of the manuscript
contains names from baltoslavic, balkanic or hebrew language strata. Two further indications
are also given: primo, highest fitness values were obtained when the crib list contains names with
specific infixes at token's penultimate position as is the case, for example, for slavic \textbf{feminine
diminutives} (i.e. names ending with -ka and not -a). In the most successful scenario, 240 characters
contained in 35 distinct Voynichese tokens were successfully transcribed. Secundo, in case of
crib stemming from Hebrew language, whole adaptation process converges to significantly better
fitness values when transcribing voynichian tokens whose order of individual characters have
been reversed, and when lists feminine and not masculine names are used as the crib.

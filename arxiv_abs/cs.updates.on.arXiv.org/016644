We consider the classic problem of computing the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of two strings
of length $n$. While a simple quadratic algorithm has been known for the problem for more than 40 years,
no faster algorithm has been found despite an extensive effort. The lack of progress on the problem
has recently been explained by Abboud, Backurs, and Vassilevska Williams [FOCS'15] and Bringmann
and K\"unnemann [FOCS'15] who proved that there is no subquadratic algorithm unless the Strong
Exponential Time Hypothesis fails. This has led the community to look for subquadratic approximation
algorithms for the problem. Yet, unlike the edit distance problem for which a constant-factor approximation
in almost-linear time is known, very little progress has been made on LCS, making it a notoriously
difficult problem also in the realm of approximation. For the general setting, only a naive $O(n^{\varepsilon/2})$-approximation
algorithm with running time $\tilde{O}(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ has been known, for any constant
$0 < \varepsilon \le 1$. Recently, a breakthrough result by Hajiaghayi, Seddighin, Seddighin,
and Sun [SODA'19] provided a linear-time algorithm that yields a $O(n^{0.497956})$-approximation
in expectation; improving upon the naive $O(\sqrt{n})$-approximation for the first time. In this
paper, we provide an algorithm that in time $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$ computes an $\tilde{O}(n^{2\varepsilon/5})$-approximation
with high probability, for any $0 < \varepsilon \le 1$. Our result (1) gives an $\tilde{O}(n^{0.4})$-approximation
in linear time, improving upon the bound of Hajiaghayi, Seddighin, Seddighin, and Sun, (2) provides
an algorithm whose approximation scales with any subquadratic running time $O(n^{2-\varepsilon})$,
improving upon the naive bound of $O(n^{\varepsilon/2})$ for any $\varepsilon$, and (3) instead
of only in expectation, succeeds with high probability.

In 2014, a union of German research organisations established Projekt DEAL, a national-level project
to negotiate licensing agreements with large scientific publishers. Negotiations between DEAL
and Elsevier began in 2016, and broke down without a successful agreement in 2018; in this time, around
200 German research institutions cancelled their license agreements with Elsevier, leading Elsevier
to restrict journal access at those institutions from July 2018 onwards. We investigated the effect
of these access restrictions on researchers' publishing and citing behaviours from a bibliometric
perspective, using a dataset of ~410,000 articles published by researchers at the affected DEAL
institutions between 2012-2020. We further investigated these effects with respect to the timing
of contract cancellations with Elsevier, research disciplines, collaboration patterns, and
article open-access status. We find evidence for a decrease in Elsevier's market share of articles
from DEAL institutions, from a peak of 25.3% in 2015 to 20.6% in 2020, with the largest year-on-year
market share decreases occurring in 2019 (-1.1%) and 2020 (-1.6%) following the implementation
of access restrictions. We also observe year-on-year decreases in the proportion of citations
made from articles published by authors at DEAL institutions to articles in Elsevier journals post-2018,
although the decrease is smaller (-0.4% in 2019 and -0.6% in 2020) than changes in publishing volume.
We conclude that Elsevier access restrictions have led to some reduced willingness of researchers
at DEAL institutions to publish their research in Elsevier journals, but that researchers are not
strongly affected in their ability to cite Elsevier articles, with the implication that researchers
use a variety of other methods (e.g. interlibrary loans, sharing between colleagues, or "shadow
libraries") to access scientific literature.

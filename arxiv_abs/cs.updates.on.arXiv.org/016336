In package recommendations, a set of items is regarded as a unified package towards a single common
goal, whereas conventional recommender systems treat items independently. For example, for music
playlist recommendations, each package (i.e., playlist) should be consistent with respect to
the genres. In group recommendations, items are recommended to a group of users, whereas conventional
recommender systems recommend items to an individual user. Different from the conventional settings,
it is difficult to measure the utility of group recommendations because it involves more than one
user. In particular, fairness is crucial in group recommendations. Even if some members in a group
are substantially satisfied with a recommendation, it is undesirable if other members are ignored
to increase the total utility. Various methods for evaluating and applying the fairness of group
recommendations have been proposed in the literature. However, all these methods maximize the
score and output only a single package. This is in contrast to conventional recommender systems,
which output several (e.g., top-$K$) candidates. This can be problematic because a group can be
dissatisfied with the recommended package owing to some unobserved reasons, even if the score is
high. In particular, each fairness measure is not absolute, and users may call for different fairness
criteria than the one adopted in the recommender system in operation. To address this issue, we propose
a method to enumerate fair packages so that a group can select their favorite packages from the list.
Our proposed method can enumerate fair packages efficiently, and users can search their favorite
packages by various filtering queries. We confirm that our algorithm scales to large datasets and
can balance several aspects of the utility of the packages.

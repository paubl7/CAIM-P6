The age of acceleration is taking place, driven by the revolutionary digital transformation creating
basically a digital version of our physical world and the currency in that digital space is data.
Massive amount of data has been generated ranging from wearable devices monitoring our physical
health every single millisecond to autonomous vehicles generating roughly 5Tb hourly to even astronomical
activities producing an order of Exabytes on daily basis and then ultra-broadband Internet comes
into play, moving such data to the cloud. Internet traffic therefore has been experiencing explosive
growth and in this context, optical transport networks forming the backbone of the Internet are
pushed for transformation in system capacity. While the intuitive solution of deploying multiple
fibers can address the pressing demand for increased capacity, doing so does not bring improvement
in economic of scales in terms of cost, power consumption and spectral efficiency. This necessitates
for a different approach so that the fiber capacity could be utilized in a more efficient manner.
In this paper, we focus on innovative techniques, that is, network coding and partial protection,
to reduce the effective traffic load in order to achieve greater capacity efficiency for optical
transport networks. Specifically, the application of network coding is examined by upgrading
the functionalities of intermediate nodes with processing (i.e., encoding and decoding) capabilities.
Besides, partial protection relying on the premise of providing just enough bandwidth in case of
failure events is investigated for saving the redundant protection capacity. What is more interesting
arises when combining both network coding and partial protection and we present insights on how
to derive compounding gains in such unique prospect.

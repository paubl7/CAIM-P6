Extending computational harmonic analysis tools from the classical setting of regular lattices
to the more general setting of graphs and networks is very important and much research has been done
recently. The Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (GHWT) developed by Irion and Saito (2014) is a
multiscale transform for signals on graphs, which is a generalization of the classical Haar and
Walsh-Hadamard Transforms. We propose the extended Generalized Haar-Walsh Transform (eGHWT),
which is a generalization of the adapted time-frequency tilings of Thiele and Villemoes (1996).
The eGHWT examines not only the efficiency of graph-domain partitions but also that of "sequency-domain"
partitions simultaneously. Consequently, the eGHWT and its associated best-basis selection
algorithm for graph signals significantly improve the performance of the previous GHWT with the
similar computational cost, $O(N \log N)$, where $N$ is the number of nodes of an input graph. While
the GHWT best-basis algorithm seeks the most suitable orthonormal basis for a given task among more
than $(1.5)^N$ possible orthonormal bases in $\mathbb{R}^N$, the eGHWT best-basis algorithm
can find a better one by searching through more than $0.618\cdot(1.84)^N$ possible orthonormal
bases in $\mathbb{R}^N$. This article describes the details of the eGHWT best-basis algorithm
and demonstrates its superiority using several examples including genuine graph signals as well
as conventional digital images viewed as graph signals. Furthermore, we also show how the eGHWT
can be extended to 2D signals and matrix-form data by viewing them as a tensor product of graphs generated
from their columns and rows and demonstrate its effectiveness on applications such as image approximation.

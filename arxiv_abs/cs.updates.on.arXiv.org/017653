Due to the explosive growth in the number of wireless devices and diverse wireless services, such
as virtual/augmented reality and Internet-of-Everything, next generation wireless networks
face unprecedented challenges caused by heterogeneous data traffic, massive connectivity, and
ultra-high bandwidth efficiency and ultra-low latency requirements. To address these challenges,
advanced multiple access schemes are expected to be developed, namely next generation multiple
access (NGMA), which are capable of supporting massive numbers of users in a more resource- and complexity-efficient
manner than existing multiple access schemes. As the research on NGMA is in a very early stage, in
this paper, we explore the evolution of NGMA with a particular focus on non-orthogonal multiple
access (NOMA), i.e., the transition from NOMA to NGMA. In particular, we first review the fundamental
capacity limits of NOMA, elaborate the new requirements for NGMA, and discuss several possible
candidate techniques. Moreover, given the high compatibility and flexibility of NOMA, we provide
an overview of current research efforts on multi-antenna techniques for NOMA, promising future
application scenarios of NOMA, and the interplay between NOMA and other emerging physical layer
techniques. Furthermore, we discuss advanced mathematical tools for facilitating the design
of NOMA communication systems, including conventional optimization approaches and new machine
learning techniques. Next, we propose a unified framework for NGMA based on multiple antennas and
NOMA, where both downlink and uplink transmission are considered, thus setting the foundation
for this emerging research area. Finally, several practical implementation challenges for NGMA
are highlighted as motivation for future work.

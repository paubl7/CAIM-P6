Accurate subsurface scattering solutions require the integration of optical material properties
along many complicated light paths. We present a method that learns a simple geometric approximation
of random paths in a homogeneous volume of translucent material. The generated representation
allows determining the absorption along the path as well as a direct lighting contribution, which
is representative of all scattering events along the path. A sequence of conditional variational
auto-encoders (CVAEs) is trained to model the statistical distribution of the photon paths inside
a spherical region in presence of multiple scattering events. A first CVAE learns to sample the number
of scattering events, occurring on a ray path inside the sphere, which effectively determines the
probability of the ray being absorbed. Conditioned on this, a second model predicts the exit position
and direction of the light particle. Finally, a third model generates a representative sample of
photon position and direction along the path, which is used to approximate the contribution of direct
illumination due to in-scattering. To accelerate the tracing of the light path through the volumetric
medium toward the solid boundary, we employ a sphere-tracing strategy that considers the light
absorption and is able to perform statistically accurate next-event estimation. We demonstrate
efficient learning using shallow networks of only three layers and no more than 16 nodes. In combination
with a GPU shader that evaluates the CVAEs' predictions, performance gains can be demonstrated
for a variety of different scenarios. A quality evaluation analyzes the approximation error that
is introduced by the data-driven scattering simulation and sheds light on the major sources of error
in the accelerated path tracing process.

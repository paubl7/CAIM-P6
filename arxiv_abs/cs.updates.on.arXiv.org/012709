Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) is an emerging technology that is able to reconfigure the
wireless channel via tunable passive signal reflection and thereby enhance the spectral and energy
efficiency of wireless networks cost-effectively. In this paper, we study an IRS-aided multiuser
multiple-input single-output (MISO) wireless system and adopt the two-timescale (TTS) transmission
to reduce the signal processing complexity and channel training overhead as compared to the existing
schemes based on the instantaneous channel state information (I-CSI), and at the same time, exploit
the multiuser channel diversity in transmission scheduling. Specifically, the long-term passive
beamforming is designed based on the statistical CSI (S-CSI) of all links, while the short-term
active beamforming is designed to cater to the I-CSI of all users' reconfigured channels with optimized
IRS phase shifts. We aim to minimize the average transmit power at the access point (AP), subject
to the users' individual quality of service (QoS) constraints. The formulated stochastic optimization
problem is non-convex and difficult to solve since the long-term and short-term design variables
are complicatedly coupled in the QoS constraints. To tackle this problem, we propose an efficient
algorithm, called the primal-dual decomposition based TTS joint active and passive beamforming
(PDD-TJAPB), where the original problem is decomposed into a long-term problem and a family of short-term
problems, and the deep unfolding technique is employed to extract gradient information from the
short-term problems to construct a convex surrogate problem for the long-term problem. The proposed
algorithm is proved to converge to a stationary solution of the original problem almost surely.
Simulation results are presented which demonstrate the advantages and effectiveness of the proposed
algorithm as compared to benchmark schemes.

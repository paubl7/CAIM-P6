Two-dimensional thin plates are widely used in many applications. Shunt damping is a promising
way for the attenuation of vibration of these electromechanical systems. It enables a compact vibration
damping method without adding significant mass and volumetric occupancy. Analyzing the dynamics
of such electromechanical systems requires precise modeling tools that properly consider the
coupling between the piezoelectric elements and the host structure. Although the concept of shunt
damping has been studied extensively in the literature, most of the studies do not provide a formulation
for modeling the multiple piezoelectric patches that are scattered on the host structure and shunted
separately. This paper presents a methodology and a formulation for separately shunted piezoelectric
patches for achieving higher performance on vibration attenuation. The Rayleigh-Ritz method
is used for performing modal analysis and obtaining the frequency response functions of the electro-mechanical
system. The developed model includes mass and stiffness contribution of the piezoelectric patches
as well as the electromechanical coupling effect. In this study, the piezoelectric patches are
shunted via separate electrical circuits and compared with the ones those are shunted via interconnected
electrical circuits. For verification, system-level finite element simulations are performed
in ANSYS software and compared with the analytical model results. An experimental setup is also
built to validate the performance of the separately shunted piezoelectric patches. The effectiveness
of the method is investigated for a broader range of frequencies and it was shown that separately
shunted piezoelectric patches are more effective compared to connected for a wide range of frequencies.

CONTRIBUTION: This paper presents an empirical study of an introductory-level programming course
with students using multiple monitors and compares their performance and self-reported experiences
versus students using a single monitor. BACKGROUND: Professional-level programming in many technological
fields often employs multiple-monitors stations, however, some education laboratories employ
single-monitor stations. This is unrepresentative of what students will encounter in practice
and experiential learning. RESEARCH QUESTIONS: This study aims to answer three research questions.
The questions include discovering the experiential observations of the students, contrasting
the performance of the students using one monitor versus those using two monitors, and an investigation
of the ways in which multiple monitors were employed by the students. METHODOLOGY: Half of the students
in the study had access to multiple monitors. This was the only difference between the two study groups.
This study contrasts grade medians and conducts median-test evaluation. Additionally, an experience
survey facilitated likert-scale values and open-ended feedback questions facilitated textual
analysis. Limitations of the study include the small sample size (86 students) and lack of control
of participant composition. FINDINGS: Students reacted very favorably in rating their experience
using the intervention. Overall, the multiple-monitor group had a slight performance improvement.
Most improvement was in software-design and graphics assignments. Performance increased statistically
significantly on the interfaces-and-hierarchies labs. Students used multiple-monitors in different
ways including reference guides, assignment specifications, and more.

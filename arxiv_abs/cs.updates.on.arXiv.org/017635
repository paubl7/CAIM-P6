Edge and Fog computing paradigms overcome the limitations of cloud-centric execution for different
latency-sensitive Internet of Things (IoT) applications by offering computing resources closer
to the data sources. Small single-board computers (SBCs) like Raspberry Pis (RPis) are widely used
as computing nodes in both paradigms. These devices are usually equipped with moderate speed processors
and provide support for peripheral interfacing and networking, making them well-suited to deal
with IoT-driven operations such as data sensing, analysis, and actuation. However, these small
Edge devices are constrained in facilitating multi-tenancy and resource sharing. The management
of computing and peripheral resources through centralized entities further degrades their performance
and service quality significantly. To address these issues, a fully distributed framework, named
Con-Pi, is proposed in this work to manage resources at the Edge or Fog environments. Con-Pi exploits
the concept of containerization and harnesses Docker containers to run IoT applications as micro-services.
%Moreover, Con-Pi operates in a distributed manner across multiple RPis and enables them to share
resources. The software system of the proposed framework also provides a scope to integrate different
IoT applications, resource and energy management policies for Edge and Fog computing. Its performance
is compared with the state-of-the-art frameworks through real-world experiments. The experimental
results show that Con-Pi outperforms others in enhancing response time and managing energy usage
and computing resources through its distributed offloading model. Further, we have developed
an automated pest bird deterrent system using Con-Pi to demonstrate its suitability in developing
practical solutions for various IoT-enabled use cases, including smart agriculture.

Recent works demonstrated the promise of using resistive random access memory (ReRAM) as an emerging
technology to perform inherently parallel analog domain in-situ matrix-vector multiplication
-- the intensive and key computation in DNNs. With weights stored in the ReRAM crossbar cells as conductance,
when the input vector is applied to word lines, the matrix-vector multiplication results can be
generated as the current in bit lines. A key problem is that the weight can be either positive or negative,
but the in-situ computation assumes all cells on each crossbar column with the same sign. The current
architectures either use two ReRAM crossbars for positive and negative weights, or add an offset
to weights so that all values become positive. Neither solution is ideal: they either double the
cost of crossbars, or incur extra offset circuity. To better solve this problem, this paper proposes
FORMS, a fine-grained ReRAM-based DNN accelerator with polarized weights. Instead of trying to
represent the positive/negative weights, our key design principle is to enforce exactly what is
assumed in the in-situ computation -- ensuring that all weights in the same column of a crossbar have
the same sign. It naturally avoids the cost of an additional crossbar. Such weights can be nicely
generated using alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) regularized optimization,
which can exactly enforce certain patterns in DNN weights. To achieve high accuracy, we propose
to use fine-grained sub-array columns, which provide a unique opportunity for input zero-skipping,
significantly avoiding unnecessary computations. It also makes the hardware much easier to implement.
Putting all together, with the same optimized models, FORMS achieves significant throughput improvement
and speed up in frame per second over ISAAC with similar area cost.

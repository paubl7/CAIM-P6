Demand for electric vehicles (EVs), and thus EV charging, has steadily increased over the last decade.
However, there is limited fast-charging infrastructure in most parts of the world to support EV
travel, especially long-distance trips. The goal of this study is to develop a stochastic dynamic
simulation modeling framework of a regional system of EV fast-charging stations for real-time
management and strategic planning (i.e., capacity allocation) purposes. To model EV user behavior,
specifically fast-charging station choices, the framework incorporates a multinomial logit
station choice model that considers charging prices, expected wait times, and detour distances.
To capture the dynamics of supply and demand at each fast-charging station, the framework incorporates
a multi-server queueing model in the simulation. The study assumes that multiple fast-charging
stations are managed by a single entity and that the demand for these stations are interrelated.
To manage the system of stations, the study proposes and tests dynamic demand-responsive price
adjustment (DDRPA) schemes based on station queue lengths. The study applies the modeling framework
to a system of EV fast-charging stations in Southern California. The results indicate that DDRPA
strategies are an effective mechanism to balance charging demand across fast-charging stations.
Specifically, compared to the no DDRPA scheme case, the quadratic DDRPA scheme reduces average
wait time by 26%, increases charging station revenue (and user costs) by 5.8%, while, most importantly,
increasing social welfare by 2.7% in the base scenario. Moreover, the study also illustrates that
the modeling framework can evaluate the allocation of EV fast-charging station capacity, to identify
stations that require additional chargers and areas that would benefit from additional fast-charging
stations.

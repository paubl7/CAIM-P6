We propose a novel framework to learn the spatiotemporal variability in longitudinal 3D shape data
sets, which contain observations of objects that evolve and deform over time. This problem is challenging
since surfaces come with arbitrary parameterizations and thus, they need to be spatially registered.
Also, different deforming objects, also called 4D surfaces, evolve at different speeds and thus
they need to be temporally aligned. We solve this spatiotemporal registration problem using a Riemannian
approach. We treat a 3D surface as a point in a shape space equipped with an elastic Riemannian metric
that measures the amount of bending and stretching that the surfaces undergo. A 4D surface can then
be seen as a trajectory in this space. With this formulation, the statistical analysis of 4D surfaces
can be cast as the problem of analyzing trajectories embedded in a nonlinear Riemannian manifold.
However, performing the spatiotemporal registration, and subsequently computing statistics,
on such nonlinear spaces is not straightforward as they rely on complex nonlinear optimizations.
Our core contribution is the mapping of the surfaces to the space of Square-Root Normal Fields where
the L2 metric is equivalent to the partial elastic metric in the space of surfaces. Thus, by solving
the spatial registration in the SRNF space, the problem of analyzing 4D surfaces becomes the problem
of analyzing trajectories embedded in the SRNF space, which has a Euclidean structure. In this paper,
we develop the building blocks that enable such analysis. These include: (1) the spatiotemporal
registration of arbitrarily parameterized 4D surfaces in the presence of large elastic deformations
and large variations in their execution rates; (2) the computation of geodesics between 4D surfaces;
(3) the computation of statistical summaries; and (4) the synthesis of random 4D surfaces.

Late blight disease is one of the most destructive diseases in potato crop, leading to serious yield
losses globally. Accurate diagnosis of the disease at early stage is critical for precision disease
control and management. Current farm practices in crop disease diagnosis are based on manual visual
inspection, which is costly, time consuming, subject to individual bias. Recent advances in imaging
sensors (e.g. RGB, multiple spectral and hyperspectral cameras), remote sensing and machine learning
offer the opportunity to address this challenge. Particularly, hyperspectral imagery (HSI) combining
with machine learning/deep learning approaches is preferable for accurately identifying specific
plant diseases because the HSI consists of a wide range of high-quality reflectance information
beyond human vision, capable of capturing both spectral-spatial information. The proposed method
considers the potential disease specific reflectance radiation variance caused by the canopy
structural diversity, introduces the multiple capsule layers to model the hierarchical structure
of the spectral-spatial disease attributes with the encapsulated features to represent the various
classes and the rotation invariance of the disease attributes in the feature space. We have evaluated
the proposed method with the real UAV-based HSI data under the controlled field conditions. The
effectiveness of the hierarchical features has been quantitatively assessed and compared with
the existing representative machine learning/deep learning methods. The experiment results
show that the proposed model significantly improves the accuracy performance when considering
hierarchical-structure of spectral-spatial features, comparing to the existing methods only
using spectral, or spatial or spectral-spatial features without consider hierarchical-structure
of spectral-spatial features.

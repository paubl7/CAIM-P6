Recently, round-trip time (RTT) measured by a fine-timing measurement protocol has received great
attention in the area of WiFi positioning. It provides an acceptable ranging accuracy in favorable
environments when a line-of-sight (LOS) path exists. Otherwise, a signal is detoured along with
non-LOS paths, making the resultant ranging results different from the ground-truth, called an
RTT bias, which is the main reason for poor positioning performance. To address it, we aim at leveraging
the user mobility trajectory detected by a smartphone's inertial measurement units, called pedestrian
dead reckoning (PDR). Specifically, PDR provides the geographic relation among adjacent locations,
guiding the resultant positioning estimates' sequence not to deviate from the user trajectory.
To this end, we describe their relations as multiple geometric equations, enabling us to render
a novel positioning algorithm with acceptable accuracy. Depending on the mobility pattern being
linear or arbitrary, we develop different algorithms divided into two phases. First, we can jointly
estimate an RTT bias of each AP and the user's step length by leveraging the geometric relation mentioned
above. It enables us to construct a user's relative trajectory defined on the concerned AP's local
coordinate system. Second, we align every AP's relative trajectory into a single one, called trajectory
alignment, equivalent to transformation to the global coordinate system. As a result, we can estimate
the sequence of the user's absolute locations from the aligned trajectory. Various field experiments
extensively verify the proposed algorithm's effectiveness that the average positioning error
is approximately 0.369 (m) and 1.705 (m) in LOS and NLOS environments, respectively.

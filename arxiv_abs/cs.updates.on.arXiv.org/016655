In the last few years, deep learning classifiers have shown promising results in image-based medical
diagnosis. However, interpreting the outputs of these models remains a challenge. In cancer diagnosis,
interpretability can be achieved by localizing the region of the input image responsible for the
output, i.e. the location of a lesion. Alternatively, segmentation or detection models can be trained
with pixel-wise annotations indicating the locations of malignant lesions. Unfortunately, acquiring
such labels is labor-intensive and requires medical expertise. To overcome this difficulty, weakly-supervised
localization can be utilized. These methods allow neural network classifiers to output saliency
maps highlighting the regions of the input most relevant to the classification task (e.g. malignant
lesions in mammograms) using only image-level labels (e.g. whether the patient has cancer or not)
during training. When applied to high-resolution images, existing methods produce low-resolution
saliency maps. This is problematic in applications in which suspicious lesions are small in relation
to the image size. In this work, we introduce a novel neural network architecture to perform weakly-supervised
segmentation of high-resolution images. The proposed model selects regions of interest via coarse-level
localization, and then performs fine-grained segmentation of those regions. We apply this model
to breast cancer diagnosis with screening mammography, and validate it on a large clinically-realistic
dataset. Measured by Dice similarity score, our approach outperforms existing methods by a large
margin in terms of localization performance of benign and malignant lesions, relatively improving
the performance by 39.6% and 20.0%, respectively. Code and the weights of some of the models are available

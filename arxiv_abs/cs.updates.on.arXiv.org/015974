Real-world imaging systems acquire measurements that are degraded by noise, optical aberrations,
and other imperfections that make image processing for human viewing and higher-level perception
tasks challenging. Conventional cameras address this problem by compartmentalizing imaging
from high-level task processing. As such, conventional imaging involves processing the RAW sensor
measurements in a sequential pipeline of steps, such as demosaicking, denoising, deblurring,
tone-mapping and compression. This pipeline is optimized to obtain a visually pleasing image.
High-level processing, on the other hand, involves steps such as feature extraction, classification,
tracking, and fusion. While this siloed design approach allows for efficient development, it also
dictates compartmentalized performance metrics, without knowledge of the higher-level task
of the camera system. For example, today's demosaicking and denoising algorithms are designed
using perceptual image quality metrics but not with domain-specific tasks such as object detection
in mind. We propose an end-to-end differentiable architecture that jointly performs demosaicking,
denoising, deblurring, tone-mapping, and classification. The architecture learns processing
pipelines whose outputs differ from those of existing ISPs optimized for perceptual quality, preserving
fine detail at the cost of increased noise and artifacts. We demonstrate on captured and simulated
data that our model substantially improves perception in low light and other challenging conditions,
which is imperative for real-world applications. Finally, we found that the proposed model also
achieves state-of-the-art accuracy when optimized for image reconstruction in low-light conditions,
validating the architecture itself as a potentially useful drop-in network for reconstruction
and analysis tasks beyond the applications demonstrated in this work.

In 2020, Brazil was the leading country in COVID-19 cases in Latin America, and capital cities were
the most severely affected by the outbreak. Climates vary in Brazil due to the territorial extension
of the country, its relief, geography, and other factors. Since the most common COVID-19 symptoms
are related to the respiratory system, many researchers have studied the correlation between the
number of COVID-19 cases with meteorological variables like temperature, humidity, rainfall,
etc. Also, due to its high transmission rate, some researchers have analyzed the impact of human
mobility on the dynamics of COVID-19 transmission. There is a dearth of literature that considers
these two variables when predicting the spread of COVID-19 cases. In this paper, we analyzed the
correlation between the number of COVID-19 cases and human mobility, and meteorological data in
Brazilian capitals. We found that the correlation between such variables depends on the regions
where the cities are located. We employed the variables with a significant correlation with COVID-19
cases to predict the number of COVID-19 infections in all Brazilian capitals and proposed a prediction
method combining the Ensemble Empirical Mode Decomposition (EEMD) method with the Autoregressive
Integrated Moving Average Exogenous inputs (ARIMAX) method, which we called EEMD-ARIMAX. After
analyzing the results poor predictions were further investigated using a signal processing-based
anomaly detection method. Computational tests showed that EEMD-ARIMAX achieved a forecast 26.73%
better than ARIMAX. Moreover, an improvement of 30.69% in the average root mean squared error (RMSE)
was noticed when applying the EEMD-ARIMAX method to the data normalized after the anomaly detection.

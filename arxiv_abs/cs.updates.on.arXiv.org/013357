Malaria, a life-threatening disease, infects millions of people every year throughout the world
demanding faster diagnosis for proper treatment before any damages occur. In this paper, an end-to-end
deep learning-based approach is proposed for faster diagnosis of malaria from thin blood smear
images by making efficient optimizations of features extracted from diversified receptive fields.
Firstly, an efficient, highly scalable deep neural network, named as DilationNet, is proposed
that incorporates features from a large spectrum by varying dilation rates of convolutions to extract
features from different receptive areas. Next, the raw images are resampled to various resolutions
to introduce variations in the receptive fields that are used for independently optimizing different
forms of DilationNet scaled for different resolutions of images. Afterward, a feature fusion scheme
is introduced with the proposed DeepFusionNet architecture for jointly optimizing the feature
space of these individually trained networks operating on different levels of observations. All
the convolutional layers of various forms of DilationNets that are optimized to extract spatial
features from different resolutions of images are directly transferred to provide a variegated
feature space from any image. Later, joint optimization of these spatial features is carried out
in the DeepFusionNet to extract the most relevant representation of the sample image. This scheme
offers the opportunity to explore the feature space extensively by varying the observation level
to accurately diagnose the abnormality. Intense experimentations on a publicly available dataset
show outstanding performance with accuracy over 99.5% outperforming other state-of-the-art
approaches.

Logic locking aims to protect the intellectual property (IP) of integrated circuit (IC) designs
throughout the globalized supply chain. The SAIL attack, based on tailored machine learning (ML)
models, circumvents combinational logic locking with high accuracy and is amongst the most potent
attacks as it does not require a functional IC acting as an oracle. In this work, we propose UNSAIL,
a logic locking technique that inserts key-gate structures with the specific aim to confuse ML models
like those used in SAIL. More specifically, UNSAIL serves to prevent attacks seeking to resolve
the structural transformations of synthesis-induced obfuscation, which is an essential step
for logic locking. Our approach is generic; it can protect any local structure of key-gates against
such ML-based attacks in an oracle-less setting. We develop a reference implementation for the
SAIL attack and launch it on both traditionally locked and UNSAIL-locked designs. In SAIL, a change-prediction
model is used to determine which key-gate structures to restore using a reconstruction model. Our
study on benchmarks ranging from the ISCAS-85 and ITC-99 suites to the OpenRISC Reference Platform
System-on-Chip (ORPSoC) confirms that UNSAIL degrades the accuracy of the change-prediction
model and the reconstruction model by an average of 20.13 and 17 percentage points (pp) respectively.
When the aforementioned models are combined, which is the most powerful scenario for SAIL, UNSAIL
reduces the attack accuracy of SAIL by an average of 11pp. We further demonstrate that UNSAIL thwarts
other oracle-less attacks, i.e., SWEEP and the redundancy attack, indicating the generic nature
and strength of our approach. Detailed layout-level evaluations illustrate that UNSAIL incurs
minimal area and power overheads of 0.26% and 0.61%, respectively, on the million-gate ORPSoC design.

We propose a 3D neural network with specific loss functions for quantitative computed tomography
(QCT) noise reduction to compute micro-structural parameters such as tissue mineral density (TMD)
and bone volume ratio (BV/TV) with significantly higher accuracy than using no or standard noise
reduction filters. The vertebra-phantom study contained high resolution peripheral and clinical
CT scans with simulated in vivo CT noise and nine repetitions of three different tube currents (100,
250 and 360 mAs). Five-fold cross validation was performed on 20466 purely spongy pairs of noisy
and ground-truth patches. Comparison of training and test errors revealed high robustness against
over-fitting. While not showing effects for the assessment of BMD and voxel-wise densities, the
filter improved thoroughly the computation of TMD and BV/TV with respect to the unfiltered data.
Root-mean-square and accuracy errors of low resolution TMD and BV/TV decreased to less than 17%
of the initial values. Furthermore filtered low resolution scans revealed still more TMD- and BV/TV-relevant
information than high resolution CT scans, either unfiltered or filtered with two state-of-the-art
standard denoising methods. The proposed architecture is threshold and rotational invariant,
applicable on a wide range of image resolutions at once, and likely serves for an accurate computation
of further micro-structural parameters. Furthermore, it is less prone for over-fitting than neural
networks that compute structural parameters directly. In conclusion, the method is potentially
important for the diagnosis of osteoporosis and other bone diseases since it allows to assess relevant
3D micro-structural information from standard low exposure CT protocols such as 100 mAs and 120
kVp.

Uncertain graphs have been widely used to model complex linked data in many real-world applications,
such as guaranteed-loan networks and power grids, where a node or edge may be associated with a probability.
In these networks, a node usually has a certain chance of default or breakdown due to self-factors
or the influence from upstream nodes. For regulatory authorities and companies, it is critical
to efficiently identify the vulnerable nodes, i.e., nodes with high default risks, such that they
could pay more attention to these nodes for the purpose of risk management. In this paper, we propose
and investigate the problem of top-$k$ vulnerable nodes detection in uncertain graphs. We formally
define the problem and prove its hardness. To identify the $k$ most vulnerable nodes, a sampling-based
approach is proposed. Rigorous theoretical analysis is conducted to bound the quality of returned
results. Novel optimization techniques and a bottom-$k$ sketch based approach are further developed
in order to scale for large networks. In the experiments, we demonstrate the performance of proposed
techniques on 3 real financial networks and 5 benchmark networks. The evaluation results show that
the proposed methods can achieve up to 2 orders of magnitudes speedup compared with the baseline
approach. Moreover, to further verify the advantages of our model in real-life scenarios, we integrate
the proposed techniques with our current loan risk control system, which is deployed in the collaborated
bank, for more evaluation. Particularly, we show that our proposed new model has superior performance
on real-life guaranteed-loan network data, which can better predict the default risks of enterprises
compared to the state-of-the-art techniques.

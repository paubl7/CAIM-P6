Quantum error mitigation techniques are at the heart of quantum computation. Conventional quantum
error correction codes are promising solutions, while they become infeasible in the noisy intermediate
scale quantum (NISQ) era, hurdled by the required expensive resources. The variational quantum
learning scheme (VQLS), which is composed of trainable quantum circuits and a gradient-based classical
optimizer, could partially adapt the noise affect by tuning the trainable parameters. However,
both empirical and theoretical results have shown that for most variational quantum algorithms,
noise can deteriorate their performances evidently when the problem size scales. Furthermore,
VQLS suffers from the barren plateau phenomenon. Here we devise a resource and runtime efficient
scheme, i.e., quantum architecture search scheme (QAS), to better improve the robustness and trainability
of VQLS. Particularly, given a learning task, QAS actively seeks an optimal architecture among
all possible circuit architectures to balance benefits and side-effects brought by adding quantum
gates, where more quantum operations enable a stronger expressive power of the quantum model but
introduce a larger amount of noise and more serious barren plateau scenario. To this end, QAS implicitly
learns a rule that can well suppress the influence of quantum noise and the barren plateau. We implement
QAS on both the numerical simulator and real quantum hardware via the IBM cloud to accomplish the
data classification and the quantum ground state approximation tasks. Numerical and experimental
results exhibit that QAS outperforms conventional variational quantum algorithms with heuristic
circuit architectures. Our work provides guidance for developing advanced learning based quantum
error mitigation techniques on near-term quantum devices.

Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and millimeter wave (mmWave) are two key enabling technologies
for the fifth-generation (5G) mobile networks and beyond. In this paper, we consider uplink communications
with a hybrid beamforming structure and focus on improving the spectral efficiency (SE) and energy
efficiency (EE) of mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)-NOMA systems with enhanced
user grouping and power allocation. Exploiting the directionality feature of mmWave channels,
we first propose a novel initial agglomerative nesting (AGNES) based user grouping algorithm by
taking advantage of the channel correlations. It is noted that the optimization of the SE/EE is a
challenging task due to the non-linear programming nature of the corresponding problem involving
user grouping, beam selection, and power allocation. Our idea is to decompose the overall optimization
problem into a mixed integer problem comprising of user grouping and beam selection only, followed
by a continuous problem involving power allocation and digital beamforming design. To avoid the
prohibitively high complexity of the brute-force search approach, we propose two suboptimal low-complexity
user grouping and beam selection schemes, the direct AGNES (DIR-AGNES) scheme and the successive
AGNES (SUC-AGNES) scheme. We also introduce the quadratic transform (QT) to recast the non-convex
power allocation optimization problem into a convex one subject to a minimum required data rate
of each user. The continuous problem is solved by iteratively optimizing the power and the digital
beamforming. Extensive simulation results have shown that our proposed mmWave-NOMA design outperforms
the conventional orthogonal multiple access (OMA) scenario and the state-of-art NOMA schemes.

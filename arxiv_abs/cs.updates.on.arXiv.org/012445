There has been empirical evidence of presence of non-linearity and chaos at the level of single neurons
in biological neural networks. The properties of chaotic neurons inspires us to employ them in artificial
learning systems. Here, we propose a Neurochaos Learning (NL) architecture, where the neurons
used to extract features from data are 1D chaotic maps. ChaosFEX+SVM, an instance of this NL architecture,
is proposed as a hybrid combination of chaos and classical machine learning algorithm. We formally
prove that a single layer of NL with a finite number of 1D chaotic neurons satisfies the Universal
Approximation Theorem with an exact value for the number of chaotic neurons needed to approximate
a discrete real valued function with finite support. This is made possible due to the topological
transitivity property of chaos and the existence of uncountably infinite number of dense orbits
for the chosen 1D chaotic map. The chaotic neurons in NL get activated under the presence of an input
stimulus (data) and output a chaotic firing trajectory. From such chaotic firing trajectories
of individual neurons of NL, we extract Firing Time, Firing Rate, Energy and Entropy that constitute
ChaosFEX features. These ChaosFEX features are then fed to a Support Vector Machine with linear
kernel for classification. The effectiveness of chaotic feature engineering performed by NL (ChaosFEX+SVM)
is demonstrated for synthetic and real world datasets in the low and high training sample regimes.
Specifically, we consider the problem of classification of genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 from
other coronaviruses (SARS-CoV-1, MERS-CoV and others). With just one training sample per class
for 1000 random trials of training, we report an average macro F1-score > 0.99 for the classification
of SARS-CoV-2 from SARS-CoV-1 genome sequences. Robustness of ChaosFEX features to additive noise
is also demonstrated.

Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) are characterized by their ability to integrate the physical and information
or cyber worlds. Their deployment in critical infrastructure have demonstrated a potential to
transform the world. However, harnessing this potential is limited by their critical nature and
the far reaching effects of cyber attacks on human, infrastructure and the environment. An attraction
for cyber concerns in CPS rises from the process of sending information from sensors to actuators
over the wireless communication medium, thereby widening the attack surface. Traditionally,
CPS security has been investigated from the perspective of preventing intruders from gaining access
to the system using cryptography and other access control techniques. Most research work have therefore
focused on the detection of attacks in CPS. However, in a world of increasing adversaries, it is becoming
more difficult to totally prevent CPS from adversarial attacks, hence the need to focus on making
CPS resilient. Resilient CPS are designed to withstand disruptions and remain functional despite
the operation of adversaries. One of the dominant methodologies explored for building resilient
CPS is dependent on machine learning (ML) algorithms. However, rising from recent research in adversarial
ML, we posit that ML algorithms for securing CPS must themselves be resilient. This paper is therefore
aimed at comprehensively surveying the interactions between resilient CPS using ML and resilient
ML when applied in CPS. The paper concludes with a number of research trends and promising future
research directions. Furthermore, with this paper, readers can have a thorough understanding
of recent advances on ML-based security and securing ML for CPS and countermeasures, as well as research
trends in this active research area.

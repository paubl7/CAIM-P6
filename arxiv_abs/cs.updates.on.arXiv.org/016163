In this work, we propose three pilot assignment schemes to reduce the effect of pilot contamination
in cell-free massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Our first algorithm, which
is based on the idea of random sequential adsorption (RSA) process from the statistical physics
literature, can be implemented in a distributed and scalable manner while ensuring a minimum distance
among the co-pilot users. Further, leveraging the rich literature of the RSA process, we present
an approximate analytical approach to accurately determine the density of the co-pilot users as
well as the pilot assignment probability for the typical user in this network. We also develop two
optimization-based centralized pilot allocation schemes with the primary goal of benchmarking
the RSA-based scheme. The first centralized scheme is based only on the user locations (just like
the RSA-based scheme) and partitions the users into sets of co-pilot users such that the minimum
distance between two users in a partition is maximized. The second centralized scheme takes both
user and remote radio head (RRH) locations into account and provides a near-optimal solution in
terms of sum-user spectral efficiency (SE). The general idea is to first cluster the users with similar
propagation conditions with respect to the RRHs using spectral graph theory and then ensure that
the users in each cluster are assigned different pilots using the branch and price (BnP) algorithm.
Our simulation results demonstrate that despite admitting distributed implementation, the RSA-based
scheme has a competitive performance with respect to the first centralized scheme in all regimes
as well as to the near-optimal second scheme when the density of RRHs is high.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced governments worldwide to impose movement restrictions on their
citizens. Although critical to reducing the virus' reproduction rate, these restrictions come
with far-reaching social and economic consequences. In this paper, we investigate the impact of
these restrictions on an individual level among software engineers who were working from home.
Although software professionals are accustomed to working with digital tools, but not all of them
remotely, in their day-to-day work, the abrupt and enforced work-from-home context has resulted
in an unprecedented scenario for the software engineering community. In a two-wave longitudinal
study (N=192), we covered over 50 psychological, social, situational, and physiological factors
that have previously been associated with well-being or productivity. Examples include anxiety,
distractions, coping strategies, psychological and physical needs, office set-up, stress, and
work motivation. This design allowed us to identify the variables that explained unique variance
in well-being and productivity. Results include (1) the quality of social contacts predicted positively,
and stress predicted an individual's well-being negatively when controlling for other variables
consistently across both waves; (2) boredom and distractions predicted productivity negatively;
(3) productivity was less strongly associated with all predictor variables at time two compared
to time one, suggesting that software engineers adapted to the lockdown situation over time; and
(4) longitudinal analyses did not provide evidence that any predictor variable causal explained
variance in well-being and productivity. Overall, we conclude that working from home was per se
not a significant challenge for software engineers.

A primary goal of remote collaboration tools is to provide effective and inclusive meetings for
all participants. To study meeting effectiveness and meeting inclusiveness, we first conducted
a large-scale email survey (N=4,425; after filtering N=3,290) at a large technology company (pre-COVID-19);
using this data we derived a multivariate model of meeting effectiveness and show how it correlates
with meeting inclusiveness, participation, and feeling comfortable to contribute. We believe
this is the first such model of meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness. The large size of the data
provided the opportunity to analyze correlations that are specific to sub-populations such as
the impact of video. The model shows the following factors are correlated with inclusiveness, effectiveness,
participation, and feeling comfortable to contribute in meetings: sending a pre-meeting communication,
sending a post-meeting summary, including a meeting agenda, attendee location, remote-only meeting,
audio/video quality and reliability, video usage, and meeting size. The model and survey results
give a quantitative understanding of how and where to improve meeting effectiveness and inclusiveness
and what the potential returns are. Motivated by the email survey results, we implemented a post-meeting
survey into a leading computer-mediated communication (CMC) system to directly measure meeting
effectiveness and inclusiveness (during COVID-19). Using initial results based on internal flighting
we created a similar model of effectiveness and inclusiveness, with many of the same findings as
the email survey. This shows a method of measuring and understanding these metrics which are both
practical and useful in a commercial CMC system.

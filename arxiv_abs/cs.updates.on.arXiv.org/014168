Fibrin is a structural protein key for processes such as wound healing and thrombus formation. At
the macroscale, fibrin forms a gel and has a mechanical response that is dictated by the mechanics
of a microscale fiber network. Hence, accurate description of fibrin gels can be achieved using
representative volume elements (RVE) that explicitly model the discrete fiber networks of the
microscale. These RVE models, however, cannot be efficiently used to model the macroscale due to
the challenges and computational demands of multiscale coupling. Here, we propose the use of an
artificial, fully connected neural network (FCNN) to efficiently capture the behavior of the RVE
models. The FCNN was trained on 1100 fiber networks subjected to 121 biaxial deformations. The stress
data from the RVE, together with the total energy on the fibers and the condition of incompressibility
of the surrounding matrix, were used to determine the derivatives of an unknown strain energy function
with respect to the deformation invariants. During training, the loss function was modified to
ensure convexity of the strain energy function and symmetry of its Hessian. A general FCNN model
was coded into a user material subroutine (UMAT) in the software Abaqus. The UMAT implementation
takes in the structure and parameters of an arbitrary FCNN as material parameters from the input
file. The inputs to the FCNN include the first two isochoric invariants of the deformation. The FCNN
outputs the derivatives of the strain energy with respect to the isochoric invariants. In this work,
the FCNN trained on the discrete fiber network data was used in finite element simulations of fibrin
gels using our UMAT. We anticipate that this work will enable further integration of machine learning
tools with computational mechanics. It will also improve computational modeling of biological
materials characterized by a multiscale structure.

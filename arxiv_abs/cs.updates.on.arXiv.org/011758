The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic continues to have a tremendous impact on patients
and healthcare systems around the world. In the fight against this novel disease, there is a pressing
need for rapid and effective screening tools to identify patients infected with COVID-19, and to
this end CT imaging has been proposed as one of the key screening methods which may be used as a complement
to RT-PCR testing, particularly in situations where patients undergo routine CT scans for non-COVID-19
related reasons, patients with worsening respiratory status or developing complications that
require expedited care, and patients suspected to be COVID-19-positive but have negative RT-PCR
test results. Motivated by this, in this study we introduce COVIDNet-CT, a deep convolutional neural
network architecture that is tailored for detection of COVID-19 cases from chest CT images via a
machine-driven design exploration approach. Additionally, we introduce COVIDx-CT, a benchmark
CT image dataset derived from CT imaging data collected by the China National Center for Bioinformation
comprising 104,009 images across 1,489 patient cases. Furthermore, in the interest of reliability
and transparency, we leverage an explainability-driven performance validation strategy to investigate
the decision-making behaviour of COVIDNet-CT, and in doing so ensure that COVIDNet-CT makes predictions
based on relevant indicators in CT images. Both COVIDNet-CT and the COVIDx-CT dataset are available
to the general public in an open-source and open access manner as part of the COVID-Net initiative.
While COVIDNet-CT is not yet a production-ready screening solution, we hope that releasing the
model and dataset will encourage researchers, clinicians, and citizen data scientists alike to
leverage and build upon them.

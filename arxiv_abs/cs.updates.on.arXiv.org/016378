Shared control in teleoperation for providing robot assistance to accomplish object manipulation,
called telemanipulation, is a new promising yet challenging problem. This has unique challenges--on
top of teleoperation challenges in general--due to difficulties of physical discrepancy between
human hands and robot hands as well as the fine motion constraints to constitute task success. We
present an intuitive shared-control strategy where the focus is on generating robotic grasp poses
which are better suited for human perception of successful teleoperated object manipulation and
feeling of being in control of the robot, rather than developing objective stable grasp configurations
for task success or following the human motion. The former is achieved by understanding human intent
and autonomously taking over control on that inference. The latter is achieved by considering human
inputs as hard motion constraints which the robot must abide. An arbitration of these two enables
a trade-off for the subsequent robot motion to balance accomplishing the inferred task and motion
constraints imposed by the operator. The arbitration framework adapts to the level of physical
discrepancy between the human and different robot structures, enabling the assistance to indicate
and appear to intuitively follow the user. To understand how users perceive good arbitration in
object telemanipulation, we have conducted a user study with a hands-free telemanipulation setup
to analyze the effect of factors including task predictability, perceived following, and user
preference. The hands-free telemanipulation scene is chosen as the validation platform due to
its more urgent need of intuitive robotics assistance for task success.

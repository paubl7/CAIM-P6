This paper introduces a novel approach of utilizing the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)
for joint data modulation and signal beamforming in a multi-user downlink cellular network by leveraging
the idea of backscatter communication. We present a general framework in which the RIS, referred
to as modulating intelligent surface (MIS) in this paper, is used to: i) beamform the signals for
a set of users whose data modulation is already performed by the base station (BS), and at the same
time, ii) embed the data of a different set of users by passively modulating the deliberately sent
carrier signals from the BS to the RIS. To maximize each user's spectral efficiency, a joint non-convex
optimization problem is formulated under the sum minimum mean-square error (MMSE) criterion.
Alternating optimization is used to divide the original joint problem into two tasks of: i) separately
optimizing the MIS phase-shifts for passive beamforming along with data embedding for the BS- and
MIS-served users, respectively, and ii) jointly optimizing the active precoder and the receive
scaling factor for the BS- and MIS-served users, respectively. While the solution to the latter
joint problem is found in closed-form using traditional optimization techniques, the optimal
phase-shifts at the MIS are obtained by deriving the appropriate optimization-oriented vector
approximate message passing (OOVAMP) algorithm. Moreover, the original joint problem is solved
under both ideal and practical constraints on the MIS phase shifts, namely, the unimodular constraint
and assuming each MIS element to be terminated by a variable reactive load. The proposed MIS-assisted
scheme is compared against state-of-the-art RIS-assisted wireless communication schemes and
simulation results reveal that it brings substantial improvements in terms of system throughput
while supporting a much higher number of users.

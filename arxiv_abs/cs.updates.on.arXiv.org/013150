In this Phd thesis discusses modern methods for constructing MET QC-LDPC codes with a given error
correction ("waterfall, error-floor") and complexity (parallelism level according circulant
size plus scheduler orthogonality of checks) profiles: 1. weight enumerators optimization, protograph
construction using Density Evolution, MI (P/Exit-chart) and it approximation: Gaussian Approximation,
Reciprocal-channel approximation and etc; 2. Covariance evolution and it approximation; 3. Lifting
methods for QC codes construction:PEG, Guest-and-Test, Hill-Climbing with girth, EMD, ACE optimization;
4. Upper and lower bounds on code distance estimation and its parallel implementation using CPU/GPU;
5. Brouwer-Zimmerman and Number Geometry code distance estimation methods; 6. Importance Sampling
for error-floor estimation; 7. Length and rate adaption methods for QC codes based on cyclic group
decomposition; 8. Methods for interaction screening which allow to improve performance (decorrelate
variables) under BP and it's approximation. We proposed several state-of-the-art methods: Simulated
Annealing lifting for MET QC-LDPC codes construction; fast EMD and code distance estimation; floor
scale modular lifting for lenght adaption; fast finite-length covariance evolution rate penalty
from threshold for code construction and it hardware friendly compression for fast decoder's LLRs
unbiasing due SNR's estimation error. We found topology reason's of efficient of such methods using
topology thickening (homotopy of continuous and discrete curvature) under matched metric space
which allow to generalize this idea to a class of nonlinear codes for Signal Processing and Machine
Learning. Using the proposed algorithms several generations of WDM Long-Haul error-correction
codes were built. It was applied for "5G eMBB" 3GPP TS38.212 and other applications like Flash storage,
Compressed sensing measurement matrix.

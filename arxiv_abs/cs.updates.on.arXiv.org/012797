The quality of healthcare provided by hospitals is subject to considerable variability. Consequently,
accurate measurements of hospital performance are essential for various decision-makers, including
patients, hospital managers and health insurers. Hospital performance is assessed via the health
outcomes of their patients. However, as the risk profiles of patients between hospitals vary, measuring
hospital performance requires adjustment for patient risk. This task is formalized in the state-of-the-art
procedure through a hierarchical generalized linear model, that isolates hospital fixed-effects
from the effect of patient risk on health outcomes. Due to the linear nature of this approach, any
non-linear relations or interaction terms between risk variables are neglected. In this work,
we propose a novel method for measuring hospital performance adjusted for patient risk. This method
captures non-linear relationships as well as interactions among patient risk variables, specifically
the effect of co-occurring health conditions on health outcomes. For this purpose, we develop a
tailored neural network architecture that is partially interpretable: a non-linear part is used
to encode risk factors, while a linear structure models hospital fixed-effects, such that the risk-adjusted
hospital performance can be estimated. We base our evaluation on more than 13 million patient admissions
across almost 1,900 US hospitals as provided by the Nationwide Readmissions Database. Our model
improves the ROC-AUC over the state-of-the-art by 4.1 percent. These findings demonstrate that
a large portion of the variance in health outcomes can be attributed to non-linear relationships
between patient risk variables and implicate that the current approach of measuring hospital performance
should be expanded.

We present Arianna+, a framework to design networks of ontologies for representing knowledge enabling
smart homes to perform human activity recognition online. In the network, nodes are ontologies
allowing for various data contextualisation, while edges are general-purpose computational
procedures elaborating data. Arianna+ provides a flexible interface between the inputs and outputs
of procedures and statements, which are atomic representations of ontological knowledge. Arianna+
schedules procedures on the basis of events by employing logic-based reasoning, i.e., by checking
the classification of certain statements in the ontologies. Each procedure involves input and
output statements that are differently contextualised in the ontologies based on specific prior
knowledge. Arianna+ allows to design networks that encode data within multiple contexts and, as
a reference scenario, we present a modular network based on a spatial context shared among all activities
and a temporal context specialised for each activity to be recognised. In the paper, we argue that
a network of small ontologies is more intelligible and has a reduced computational load than a single
ontology encoding the same knowledge. Arianna+ integrates in the same architecture heterogeneous
data processing techniques, which may be better suited to different contexts. Thus, we do not propose
a new algorithmic approach to activity recognition, instead, we focus on the architectural aspects
for accommodating logic-based and data-driven activity models in a context-oriented way. Also,
we discuss how to leverage data contextualisation and reasoning for activity recognition, and
to support an iterative development process driven by domain experts.

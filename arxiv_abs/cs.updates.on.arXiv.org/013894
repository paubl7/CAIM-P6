Data privacy is an important issue for organizations and enterprises to securely outsource data
storage, sharing, and computation on clouds / fogs. However, data encryption is complicated in
terms of the key management and distribution; existing secure computation techniques are expensive
in terms of computational / communication cost and therefore do not scale to big data computation.
Tensor network decomposition and distributed tensor computation have been widely used in signal
processing and machine learning for dimensionality reduction and large-scale optimization.
However, the potential of distributed tensor networks for big data privacy preservation have not
been considered before, this motivates the current study. Our primary intuition is that tensor
network representations are mathematically non-unique, unlinkable, and uninterpretable; tensor
network representations naturally support a range of multilinear operations for compressed and
distributed / dispersed computation. Therefore, we propose randomized algorithms to decompose
big data into randomized tensor network representations and analyze the privacy leakage for 1D
to 3D data tensors. The randomness mainly comes from the complex structural information commonly
found in big data; randomization is based on controlled perturbation applied to the tensor blocks
prior to decomposition. The distributed tensor representations are dispersed on multiple clouds
/ fogs or servers / devices with metadata privacy, this provides both distributed trust and management
to seamlessly secure big data storage, communication, sharing, and computation. Experiments
show that the proposed randomization techniques are helpful for big data anonymization and efficient
for big data storage and computation.

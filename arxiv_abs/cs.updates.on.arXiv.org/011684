One aim of data mining is the identification of interesting structures in data. For better analytical
results, the basic properties of an empirical distribution, such as skewness and eventual clipping,
i.e. hard limits in value ranges, need to be assessed. Of particular interest is the question of whether
the data originate from one process or contain subsets related to different states of the data producing
process. Data visualization tools should deliver a clear picture of the univariate probability
density distribution (PDF) for each feature. Visualization tools for PDFs typically use kernel
density estimates and include both the classical histogram, as well as the modern tools like ridgeline
plots, bean plots and violin plots. If density estimation parameters remain in a default setting,
conventional methods pose several problems when visualizing the PDF of uniform, multimodal, skewed
distributions and distributions with clipped data, For that reason, a new visualization tool called
the mirrored density plot (MD plot), which is specifically designed to discover interesting structures
in continuous features, is proposed. The MD plot does not require adjusting any parameters of density
estimation, which is what may make the use of this plot compelling particularly to non-experts.
The visualization tools in question are evaluated against statistical tests with regard to typical
challenges of explorative distribution analysis. The results of the evaluation are presented
using bimodal Gaussian, skewed distributions and several features with already published PDFs.
In an exploratory data analysis of 12 features describing quarterly financial statements, when
statistical testing poses a great difficulty, only the MD plots can identify the structure of their
PDFs. In sum, the MD plot outperforms the above mentioned methods.

Suppose we wish to predict the behaviour of a physical system. We may choose to represent the system
by model structure $S$ (a set of related mathematical models defined by parametric relationships
between system variables), and a parameter set $\Theta$. Each parameter vector in $\Theta$ is associated
with a completely specified model in $S$. We use $S$ with system observations in estimating the "true"
(unknown) parameter vector. Inconveniently, multiple parameter vectors may cause $S$ to approximate
the data equally well. If we cannot distinguish between such alternatives, and these lead to dissimilar
predictions, we cannot confidently use $S$ in decision making. This result may render efforts in
data collection and modelling fruitless. This outcome occurs when $S$ lacks the property of structural
global identifiability (SGI). Fortunately, we can test various classes of structures for SGI prior
to data collection. A non-SGI result may guide changes to our structure or experimental design towards
obtaining a better outcome. We aim to assist the testing of structures for SGI through bespoke Maple
2020 procedures. We consider continuous-time, uncontrolled, linear time-invariant state-space
structures. Here, the time evolution of the state-variable vector ${\bf x}$ is modelled by a system
of constant-coefficient, ordinary differential equations. We utilise the "transfer function"
approach, which is also applicable to the "compartmental" subclass (mass is conserved). Our use
of Maple's "Explore" enables an interactive consideration of a parent structure and its variants,
obtained as the user changes which components of ${\bf x}$ are observed, or have non-zero initial
conditions. Such changes may influence the information content of the idealised output available
for the SGI test, and hence, its result. Our approach may inform the interactive analysis of structures
from other classes.

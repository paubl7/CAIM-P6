Fruit tree pruning and fruit thinning require a powerful vision system that can provide high resolution
segmentation of the fruit trees and their branches. However, recent works only consider the dormant
season, where there are minimal occlusions on the branches or fit a polynomial curve to reconstruct
branch shape and hence, losing information about branch thickness. In this work, we apply two state-of-the-art
supervised learning models U-Net and DeepLabv3, and a conditional Generative Adversarial Network
Pix2Pix (with and without the discriminator) to segment partially occluded 2D-open-V apple trees.
Binary accuracy, Mean IoU, Boundary F1 score and Occluded branch recall were used to evaluate the
performances of the models. DeepLabv3 outperforms the other models at Binary accuracy, Mean IoU
and Boundary F1 score, but is surpassed by Pix2Pix (without discriminator) and U-Net in Occluded
branch recall. We define two difficulty indices to quantify the difficulty of the task: (1) Occlusion
Difficulty Index and (2) Depth Difficulty Index. We analyze the worst 10 images in both difficulty
indices by means of Branch Recall and Occluded Branch Recall. U-Net outperforms the other two models
in the current metrics. On the other hand, Pix2Pix (without discriminator) provides more information
on branch paths, which are not reflected by the metrics. This highlights the need for more specific
metrics on recovering occluded information. Furthermore, this shows the usefulness of image-transfer
networks for hallucination behind occlusions. Future work is required to further enhance the models
to recover more information from occlusions such that this technology can be applied to automating
agricultural tasks in a commercial environment.

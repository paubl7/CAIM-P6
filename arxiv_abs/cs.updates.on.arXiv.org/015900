One salient feature of cooperative formation tracking is its distributed nature that relies on
localized control and information sharing over a sparse communication network. That is, a distributed
control manner could be prone to malicious attacks and unreliable communication that deteriorate
the formation tracking performance or even destabilize the whole multi-agent system. This paper
studies a safe and reliable time-varying output formation tracking problem of linear multi-agent
systems, where an attacker adversely injects any unbounded time-varying signals (false data injection
(FDI) attacks), while an interruption of communication channels between the agents is caused by
an unreliable network. Both characteristics improve the practical relevance of the problem to
be addressed, which poses some technical challenges to the distributed algorithm design and stability
analysis. To mitigate the adverse effect, a novel resilient distributed control architecture
is established to guarantee time-varying output formation tracking exponentially. The key features
of the proposed framework are threefold: 1) an observer-based identifier is integrated to compensate
for adverse effects; 2) a reliable distributed algorithm is proposed to deal with time-varying
topologies caused by unreliable communication; and 3) in contrast to the existing remedies that
deal with attacks as bounded disturbances/faults with known knowledge, we propose resilience
strategies to handle unknown and unbounded attacks for exponential convergence of dynamic formation
tracking errors, whereas most of existing results achieve uniformly ultimately boundedness (UUB)
results. Numerical simulations are given to show the effectiveness of the proposed design.

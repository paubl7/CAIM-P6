In the fields of co-simulation and component-based modelling, designers import models as building
blocks to create a composite model that provides more complex functionalities. Modelling tools
perform instantaneous cycle detection (ICD) on the composite models having feedback loops to reject
the models if the loops are mathematically unsound and to improve simulation performance. In this
case, the analysis relies heavily on the availability of dependency information from the imported
models. However, the cycle detection problem becomes harder when the model's input to output dependencies
are mode-dependent, i.e. changes for certain events generated internally or externally as inputs.
The number of possible modes created by composing such models increases significantly and unknown
factors such as environmental inputs make the offline (statical) ICD a difficult task. In this paper,
an online ICD method is introduced to address this issue for the models used in cyber-physical systems.
The method utilises an oracle as a central source of information that can answer whether the individual
models can make mode transition without creating instantaneous cycles. The oracle utilises three
types of data-structures created offline that are adaptively chosen during online (runtime) depending
on the frequency as well as the number of models that make mode transitions. During the analysis,
the models used online are stalled from running, resulting in the discrepancy with the physical
system. The objective is to detect an absence of the instantaneous cycle while minimising the stall
time of the model simulation that is induced from the analysis. The benchmark results show that our
method is an adequate alternative to the offline analysis methods and significantly reduces the
analysis time.

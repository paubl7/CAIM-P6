Evolutionary Computation is a group of biologically inspired algorithms used to solve complex
optimisation problems. It can be split into Evolutionary Algorithms, which take inspiration from
genetic inheritance, and Swarm Intelligence algorithms, that take inspiration from cultural
inheritance. However, recent developments have focused on computational or mathematical adaptions,
leaving their biological roots behind. This has left much of the modern evolutionary literature
relatively unexplored. To understand which evolutionary mechanisms have been considered, and
which have been overlooked, this paper breaks down successful bio-inspired algorithms under a
contemporary biological framework based on the Extended Evolutionary Synthesis, an extension
of the classical, genetics focussed, Modern Synthesis. The analysis shows that Darwinism and the
Modern Synthesis have been incorporated into Evolutionary Computation but that the Extended Evolutionary
Synthesis has been broadly ignored beyond:cultural inheritance, incorporated in the sub-set
of Swarm Intelligence algorithms, evolvability, through CMA-ES, and multilevel selection, through
Multi-Level Selection Genetic Algorithm. The framework shows a missing gap in epigenetic inheritance
for Evolutionary Computation, despite being a key building block in modern interpretations of
how evolution occurs. Epigenetic inheritance can explain fast adaptation, without changes in
an individual's genotype, by allowing biological organisms to self-adapt quickly to environmental
cues, which, increases the speed of convergence while maintaining stability in changing environments.
This leaves a diverse range of biologically inspired mechanisms as low hanging fruit that should
be explored further within Evolutionary Computation.

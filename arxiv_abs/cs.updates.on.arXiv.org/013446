Anomaly detection is necessary for proper and safe operation of large-scale systems consisting
of multiple devices, networks, and/or plants. Those systems are often characterized by a pair of
multivariate datasets. To detect anomaly in such a system and localize element(s) associated with
anomaly, one would need to estimate scores that quantify anomalousness of the entire system as well
as its elements. However, it is not trivial to estimate such scores by considering changes of relationships
between the elements, which strongly correlate with each other. Moreover, it is necessary to estimate
the scores for the entire system and its elements from a single framework, in order to identify relationships
among the scores for localizing elements associated with anomaly. Here, we developed a new method
to quantify anomalousness of an entire system and its elements simultaneously. The purpose of this
paper is threefold. The first one is to propose a new anomaly detection method: Double Kernelized
Scoring (DKS). DKS is a unified framework for entire-system anomaly scoring and element-wise anomaly
scoring. Therefore, DKS allows for conducting simultaneously 1) anomaly detection for the entire
system and 2) localization for identifying faulty elements responsible for the system anomaly.
The second purpose is to propose a new kernel function: Matrix Kernel. The Matrix Kernel is defined
between general matrices, which might have different dimensions, allowing for conducting anomaly
detection on systems where the number of elements change over time. The third purpose is to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed method experimentally. We evaluated the proposed method with
synthetic and real time series data. The results demonstrate that DKS is able to detect anomaly and
localize the elements associated with it successfully.

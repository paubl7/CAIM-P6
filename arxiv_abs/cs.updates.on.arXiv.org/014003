Mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps) have gained significant popularity over the last
few years due to its tremendous benefits, such as lowering healthcare cost and increasing patient
awareness. However, the sensitivity of healthcare data makes the security of mHealth apps a serious
concern. In this review, we aim to identify and analyse the reported challenges that the developers
of mHealth apps face concerning security. Additionally, our study aimed to develop a conceptual
framework with the challenges faced by mHealth apps development organization for developing secure
apps. The knowledge of such challenges can help to reduce the risk of developing insecure mHealth
apps. We followed the Systematic Literature Review method for this review. We selected studies
that have been published between January 2008 and October 2020. We selected 32 primary studies using
predefined criteria and used thematic analysis method for analysing the extracted data. We identified
nine challenges that can affect the development of secure mHealth apps. Such as 1) lack of security
guidelines and regulations for developing secure mHealth apps, 2) developers lack of knowledge
and expertise for secure mHealth app development, 3) lack of stakeholders involvement during mHealth
app development, etc . Based on our analysis, we have presented a conceptual framework which highlights
the correlation between the identified challenges. We conclude that our findings can help them
identify their weaknesses and improve their security practices. Similarly, mHealth apps developers
can identify the challenges they face to develop mHealth apps that do not pose security risks for
users. Our review is a step towards providing insights into the development of secure mHealth apps.
Our proposed conceptual framework can act as a practice guideline for practitioners to enhance
secure mHealth apps development.

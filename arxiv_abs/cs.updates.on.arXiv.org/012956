We prove that a sufficiently strong parallel repetition theorem for a special case of multiplayer
(multiprover) games implies super-linear lower bounds for multi-tape Turing machines with advice.
To the best of our knowledge, this is the first connection between parallel repetition and lower
bounds for time complexity and the first major potential implication of a parallel repetition theorem
with more than two players. Along the way to proving this result, we define and initiate a study of
block rigidity, extending Valiant's notion of rigidity. While rigidity was originally defined
for matrices, or, equivalently, for (multi-output) linear functions, we extend and study both
rigidity and block rigidity for general (multi-output) functions. Using techniques of Paul, Pippenger,
Szemer\'edi and Trotter, we show that a block-rigid function cannot be computed by multi-tape Turing
machines that run in linear (or slightly super-linear) time, even in the non-uniform setting, where
the machine gets an arbitrary advice tape. We then describe a class of multiplayer games, such that,
a sufficiently strong parallel repetition theorem for that class of games implies an explicit block-rigid
function. The games in that class have the following property that may be of independent interest:
for every random string for the verifier (which, in particular, determines the vector of queries
to the players), there is a unique correct answer for each of the players, and the verifier accepts
if and only if all answers are correct. We refer to such games as independent games. The theorem that
we need is that parallel repetition reduces the value of games in this class from $v$ to $v^{\Omega(n)}$,
where $n$ is the number of repetitions. As another application of block rigidity, we show conditional
size-depth tradeoffs for boolean circuits, where the gates compute arbitrary functions over large
sets.

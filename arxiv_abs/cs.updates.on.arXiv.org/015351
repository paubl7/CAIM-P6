Reshaping accurate and realistic 3D human bodies from anthropometric parameters (e.g., height,
chest size, etc.) poses a fundamental challenge for person identification, online shopping and
virtual reality. Existing approaches for creating such 3D shapes often suffer from complex measurement
by range cameras or high-end scanners, which either involve heavy expense cost or result in low quality.
However, these high-quality equipments limit existing approaches in real applications, because
the equipments are not easily accessible for common users. In this paper, we have designed a 3D human
body reshaping system by proposing a novel feature-selection-based local mapping technique,
which enables automatic anthropometric parameter modeling for each body facet. Note that the proposed
approach can leverage limited anthropometric parameters (i.e., 3-5 measurements) as input, which
avoids complex measurement, and thus better user-friendly experience can be achieved in real scenarios.
Specifically, the proposed reshaping model consists of three steps. First, we calculate full-body
anthropometric parameters from limited user inputs by imputation technique, and thus essential
anthropometric parameters for 3D body reshaping can be obtained. Second, we select the most relevant
anthropometric parameters for each facet by adopting relevance masks, which are learned offline
by the proposed local mapping technique. Third, we generate the 3D body meshes by mapping matrices,
which are learned by linear regression from the selected parameters to mesh-based body representation.
We conduct experiments by anthropomorphic evaluation and a user study from 68 volunteers. Experiments
show the superior results of the proposed system in terms of mean reconstruction error against the
state-of-the-art approaches.

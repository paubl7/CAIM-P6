Since the first reports of a novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019, over 33 million people
have been infected worldwide and approximately 1 million people worldwide have died from the disease
caused by this virus, COVID-19. In the US alone, there have been approximately 7 million cases and
over 200,000 deaths. This outbreak has placed an enormous strain on healthcare systems and workers.
Severe cases require hospital care, and 8.5\% of patients require mechanical ventilation in an
intensive care unit (ICU). One major challenge is the necessity for clinical care personnel to don
and doff cumbersome personal protective equipment (PPE) in order to enter an ICU unit to make simple
adjustments to ventilator settings. Although future ventilators and other ICU equipment may be
controllable remotely through computer networks, the enormous installed base of existing ventilators
do not have this capability. This paper reports the development of a simple, low cost telerobotic
system that permits adjustment of ventilator settings from outside the ICU. The system consists
of a small Cartesian robot capable of operating a ventilator touch screen with camera vision control
via a wirelessly connected tablet master device located outside the room. Engineering system tests
demonstrated that the open-loop mechanical repeatability of the device was 7.5\,mm, and that the
average positioning error of the robotic finger under visual servoing control was 5.94\,mm. Successful
usability tests in a simulated ICU environment were carried out and are reported. In addition to
enabling a significant reduction in PPE consumption, the prototype system has been shown in a preliminary
evaluation to significantly reduce the total time required for a respiratory therapist to perform
typical setting adjustments on a commercial ventilator, including donning and doffing PPE, from
271 seconds to 109 seconds.

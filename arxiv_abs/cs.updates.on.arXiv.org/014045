This paper studies the energy efficiency of composable datacentre (DC) infrastructures over network
topologies. Using a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model, we compare the performance
of disaggregation at rack-scale and pod-scale over selected electrical, optical and hybrid network
topologies relative to a traditional DC. Relative to a pod-scale DC, the results show that physical
disaggregation at rack-scale is sufficient for optimal efficiency when the optical network topology
is adopted and resource components are allocated in a suitable manner. The optical network topology
also enables optimal energy efficiency in composable DCs. The paper also studies logical disaggregation
of traditional DC servers over an optical network topology. Relative to physical disaggregation
at rack-scale, logical disaggregation of server resources within each rack enables marginal fall
in the total DC power consumption (TDPC) due to improved resource demands placement. Hence, an adaptable
composable infrastructure that can support both in memory (access) latency sensitive and insensitive
workloads is enabled. We also conduct a study of the adoption of micro-service architecture in both
traditional and composable DCs. Our results show that increasing the modularity of workloads improves
the energy efficiency in traditional DCs, but disproportionate utilization of DC resources persists.
A combination of disaggregation and micro-services achieved up to 23% reduction in the TDPC of the
traditional DC by enabling optimal resources utilization and energy efficiencies. Finally, we
propose a heuristic for energy efficient placement of workloads in composable DCs which replicates
the trends produced by the MILP model formulated in this paper.

3D point cloud registration is a fundamental problem in computer vision and robotics. There has
been extensive research in this area, but existing methods meet great challenges in situations
with a large proportion of outliers and time constraints, but without good transformation initialization.
Recently, a series of learning-based algorithms have been introduced and show advantages in speed.
Many of them are based on correspondences between the two point clouds, so they do not rely on transformation
initialization. However, these learning-based methods are sensitive to outliers, which lead
to more incorrect correspondences. In this paper, we propose a novel deep graph matchingbased framework
for point cloud registration. Specifically, we first transform point clouds into graphs and extract
deep features for each point. Then, we develop a module based on deep graph matching to calculate
a soft correspondence matrix. By using graph matching, not only the local geometry of each point
but also its structure and topology in a larger range are considered in establishing correspondences,
so that more correct correspondences are found. We train the network with a loss directly defined
on the correspondences, and in the test stage the soft correspondences are transformed into hard
one-to-one correspondences so that registration can be performed by singular value decomposition.
Furthermore, we introduce a transformer-based method to generate edges for graph construction,
which further improves the quality of the correspondences. Extensive experiments on registering
clean, noisy, partial-to-partial and unseen category point clouds show that the proposed method
achieves state-of-the-art performance. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/fukexue/RGM.

Background. In Italy, in recent years, vaccination coverage for key immunizations as MMR has been
declining to worryingly low levels. In 2017, the Italian Gov't expanded the number of mandatory
immunizations introducing penalties to unvaccinated children's families. During the 2018 general
elections campaign, immunization policy entered the political debate with the Gov't in charge
blaming oppositions for fuelling vaccine scepticism. A new Gov't established in 2018 temporarily
relaxed penalties. Objectives and Methods. Using a sentiment analysis on tweets posted in Italian
during 2018, we aimed to: (i) characterize the temporal flow of vaccines communication on Twitter
(ii) evaluate the polarity of vaccination opinions and usefulness of Twitter data to estimate vaccination
parameters, and (iii) investigate whether the contrasting announcements at the highest political
level might have originated disorientation amongst the Italian public. Results. Vaccine-relevant
tweeters interactions peaked in response to main political events. Out of retained tweets, 70.0%
resulted favourable to vaccination, 16.5% unfavourable, and 13.6% undecided, respectively.
The smoothed time series of polarity proportions exhibit frequent large changes in the favourable
proportion, enhanced by an up and down trend synchronized with the switch between gov't suggesting
evidence of disorientation among the public. Conclusion. The reported evidence of disorientation
documents that critical immunization topics, should never be used for political consensus. This
is especially true given the increasing role of online social media as information source, which
might yield to social pressures eventually harmful for vaccine uptake, and is worsened by the lack
of institutional presence on Twitter, calling for efforts to contrast misinformation and the ensuing
spread of hesitancy.

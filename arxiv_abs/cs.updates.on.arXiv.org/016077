This paper considers joint learning of multiple sparse Granger graphical models to discover underlying
common and differential Granger causality (GC) structures across multiple time series. This can
be applied to drawing group-level brain connectivity inferences from a homogeneous group of subjects
or discovering network differences among groups of signals collected under heterogeneous conditions.
By recognizing that the GC of a single multivariate time series can be characterized by common zeros
of vector autoregressive (VAR) lag coefficients, a group sparse prior is included in joint regularized
least-squares estimations of multiple VAR models. Group-norm regularizations based on group-
and fused-lasso penalties encourage a decomposition of multiple networks into a common GC structure,
with other remaining parts defined in individual-specific networks. Prior information about
sparseness and sparsity patterns of desired GC networks are incorporated as relative weights,
while a non-convex group norm in the penalty is proposed to enhance the accuracy of network estimation
in low-sample settings. Extensive numerical results on simulations illustrated our method's
improvements over existing sparse estimation approaches on GC network sparsity recovery. Our
methods were also applied to available resting-state fMRI time series from the ADHD-200 data sets
to learn the differences of causality mechanisms, called effective brain connectivity, between
adolescents with ADHD and typically developing children. Our analysis revealed that parts of the
causality differences between the two groups often resided in the orbitofrontal region and areas
associated with the limbic system, which agreed with clinical findings and data-driven results
in previous studies.

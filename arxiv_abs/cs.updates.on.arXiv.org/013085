Genome assembly is a fundamental problem in Bioinformatics, requiring to reconstruct a source
genome from an assembly graph built from a set of reads (short strings sequenced from the genome).
A notion of genome assembly solution is that of an arc-covering walk of the graph. Since assembly
graphs admit many solutions, the goal is to find what is definitely present in all solutions, or what
is safe. Most practical assemblers are based on heuristics having at their core unitigs, namely
paths whose internal nodes have unit in-degree and out-degree, and which are clearly safe. The long-standing
open problem of finding all the safe parts of the solutions was recently solved by a major theoretical
result [RECOMB'16]. This safe and complete genome assembly algorithm was followed by other works
improving the time bounds, as well as extending the results for different notions of assembly solution.
But it remained open whether one can be complete also for models of genome assembly of practical applicability.
In this paper we present a universal framework for obtaining safe and complete algorithms which
unify the previous results, while also allowing for easy generalizations to assembly problems
including many practical aspects. This is based on a novel graph structure, called the hydrostructure
of a walk, which highlights the reachability properties of the graph from the perspective of the
walk. The hydrostructure allows for simple characterizations of the existing safe walks, and of
their new practical versions. Almost all of our characterizations are directly adaptable to optimal
verification algorithms, and simple enumeration algorithms. Most of these algorithms are also
improved to optimality using an incremental computation procedure and a previous optimal algorithm
of a specific model.

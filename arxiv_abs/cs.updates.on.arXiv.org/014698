Many problems in interprocedural program analysis can be modeled as the context-free language
(CFL) reachability problem on graphs and can be solved in cubic time. Despite years of efforts, there
are no known truly sub-cubic algorithms for this problem. We study the related certification task:
given an instance of CFL reachability, are there small and efficiently checkable certificates
for the existence and for the non-existence of a path? We show that, in both scenarios, there exist
succinct certificates ($O(n^2)$ in the size of the problem) and these certificates can be checked
in subcubic (matrix multiplication) time. The certificates are based on grammar-based compression
of paths (for positive instances) and on invariants represented as matrix constraints (for negative
instances). Thus, CFL reachability lies in nondeterministic and co-nondeterministic subcubic
time. A natural question is whether faster algorithms for CFL reachability will lead to faster algorithms
for combinatorial problems such as Boolean satisfiability (SAT). As a consequence of our certification
results, we show that there cannot be a fine-grained reduction from SAT to CFL reachability for a
conditional lower bound stronger than $n^\omega$, unless the nondeterministic strong exponential
time hypothesis (NSETH) fails. Our results extend to related subcubic equivalent problems: pushdown
reachability and two-way nondeterministic pushdown automata (2NPDA) language recognition.
For example, we describe succinct certificates for pushdown non-reachability (inductive invariants)
and observe that they can be checked in matrix multiplication time. We also extract a new hardest
2NPDA language, capturing the "hard core" of all these problems.

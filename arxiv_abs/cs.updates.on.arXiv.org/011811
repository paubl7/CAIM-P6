In mobile Internet ecosystem, Mobile Users (MUs) purchase wireless data services from Internet
Service Provider (ISP) to access to Internet and acquire the interested content services (e.g.,
online game) from Content Provider (CP). The popularity of intelligent functions (e.g., AI and
3D modeling) increases the computation-intensity of the content services, leading to a growing
computation pressure for the MUs' resource-limited devices. To this end, edge computing service
is emerging as a promising approach to alleviate the MUs' computation pressure while keeping their
quality-of-service, via offloading some computation tasks of MUs to edge (computing) servers
deployed at the local network edge. Thus, Edge Service Provider (ESP), who deploys the edge servers
and offers the edge computing service, becomes an upcoming new stakeholder in the ecosystem. In
this work, we study the economic interactions of MUs, ISP, CP, and ESP in the new ecosystem with edge
computing service, where MUs can acquire the computation-intensive content services (offered
by CP) and offload some computation tasks, together with the necessary raw input data, to edge servers
(deployed by ESP) through ISP. We first study the MU's Joint Content Acquisition and Task Offloading
(J-CATO) problem, which aims to maximize his long-term payoff. We derive the off-line solution
with crucial insights, based on which we design an online strategy with provable performance. Then,
we study the ESP's edge service monetization problem. We propose a pricing policy that can achieve
a constant fraction of the ex-post optimal revenue with an extra constant loss for the ESP. Numerical
results show that the edge computing service can stimulate the MUs' content acquisition and improve
the payoffs of MUs, ISP, and CP.

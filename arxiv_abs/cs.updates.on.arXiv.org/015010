Machine learning (ML) models are constructed by expert ML practitioners using various coding languages,
in which they tune and select models hyperparameters and learning algorithms for a given problem
domain. They also carefully design an objective function or loss function (often with multiple
objectives) that captures the desired output for a given ML task such as classification, regression,
etc. In multi-objective optimization, conflicting objectives and constraints is a major area
of concern. In such problems, several competing objectives are seen for which no single optimal
solution is found that satisfies all desired objectives simultaneously. In the past VA systems
have allowed users to interactively construct objective functions for a classifier. In this paper,
we extend this line of work by prototyping a technique to visualize multi-objective objective functions
either defined in a Jupyter notebook or defined using an interactive visual interface to help users
to: (1) perceive and interpret complex mathematical terms in it and (2) detect and resolve conflicting
objectives. Visualization of the objective function enlightens potentially conflicting objectives
that obstructs selecting correct solution(s) for the desired ML task or goal. We also present an
enumeration of potential conflicts in objective specification in multi-objective objective
functions for classifier selection. Furthermore, we demonstrate our approach in a VA system that
helps users in specifying meaningful objective functions to a classifier by detecting and resolving
conflicting objectives and constraints. Through a within-subject quantitative and qualitative
user study, we present results showing that our technique helps users interactively specify meaningful
objective functions by resolving potential conflicts for a classification task.

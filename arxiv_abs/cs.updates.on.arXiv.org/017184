Image super-resolution (SR) methods can generate remote sensing images with high spatial resolution
without increasing the cost, thereby providing a feasible way to acquire high-resolution remote
sensing images, which are difficult to obtain due to the high cost of acquisition equipment and complex
weather. Clearly, image super-resolution is a severe ill-posed problem. Fortunately, with the
development of deep learning, the powerful fitting ability of deep neural networks has solved this
problem to some extent. In this paper, we propose a network based on the generative adversarial network
(GAN) to generate high resolution remote sensing images, named the multi-attention generative
adversarial network (MA-GAN). We first designed a GAN-based framework for the image SR task. The
core to accomplishing the SR task is the image generator with post-upsampling that we designed.
The main body of the generator contains two blocks; one is the pyramidal convolution in the residual-dense
block (PCRDB), and the other is the attention-based upsample (AUP) block. The attentioned pyramidal
convolution (AttPConv) in the PCRDB block is a module that combines multi-scale convolution and
channel attention to automatically learn and adjust the scaling of the residuals for better results.
The AUP block is a module that combines pixel attention (PA) to perform arbitrary multiples of upsampling.
These two blocks work together to help generate better quality images. For the loss function, we
design a loss function based on pixel loss and introduce both adversarial loss and feature loss to
guide the generator learning. We have compared our method with several state-of-the-art methods
on a remote sensing scene image dataset, and the experimental results consistently demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed MA-GAN.

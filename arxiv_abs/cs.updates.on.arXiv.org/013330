As we are moving towards the new era of 5G supported verticals and their services, there is a surge
in the mobile network investments and equipment deployments. The traditional monolithic mobile
network radio access equipment, generally called as the base station (BS), houses radio units (RU),
processors and accelerators along with proprietary software. With the advances in cloud technologies,
disaggregated Radio Access Network (RAN) architectures emerged in the past decade, where Network
Functions (NFs) are ripped away from specialized hardware and placed on bare metal servers. Although
the concept of RAN evolution has been around for some time starting from Cloud Radio Access Networks
(C-RANs), continuing with Virtual Radio Access Networks (vRANs) and most recently Open Radio Access
Networks (ORANs), we are seeing commercial implementations and tests of disaggregated, virtualized
and open RANs only since the beginning of 2020. One unique aspect that motivates this paper is the
availability of new opportunities that arise from applying machine learning to optimize the RAN
in closed-loop, i.e. without human intervention, where the complexity of disaggregation and virtualization
makes well-known Self-Organized Networking (SON) solutions inadequate. In particular, Multi-agent
systems (MASs) is expected to play an essential role in the control and coordination of near-real-time
and nonreal-time RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC). In this visionary article, we first present
the state-of-the-art research in multiagent systems and team learning, then we provide an overview
of the landscape in RAN disaggregation, virtualization, as well as ORAN which emphasizes the open
interfaces introduced by the O-RAN Alliance. We present a case study for ML-based disaggregation,
and finally, we identify challenges and open issues to provide a roadmap for researchers.

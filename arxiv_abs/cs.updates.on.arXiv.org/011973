Petrographic analysis based on microfacies identification in thin sections is widely used in sedimentary
environment interpretation and paleoecological reconstruction. Fossil recognition from microfacies
is an essential procedure for petrographers to complete this task. Distinguishing the morphological
and microstructural diversity of skeletal fragments requires extensive prior knowledge of fossil
morphotypes in microfacies and long training sessions under the microscope. This requirement
engenders certain challenges for sedimentologists and paleontologists, especially novices.
However, a machine classifier can help address this challenge. We collected a microfacies image
dataset comprising both public data from 1,149 references and our own materials (including a total
of 30,815 images of 22 fossil and abiotic grain groups). We employed a high-performance workstation
to implement four classic deep convolutional neural networks (DCNNs), which have proven to be highly
efficient in computer vision over the last several years. Our framework uses a transfer learning
technique, which reuses the pre-trained parameters that are trained on a larger ImageNet dataset
as initialization for the network to achieve high accuracy with low computing costs. We obtained
up to 95% of the top one and 99% of the top three test accuracies in the Inception ResNet v2 architecture.
The machine classifier exhibited 0.99 precision on minerals, such as dolomite and pyrite. Although
it had some difficulty on samples having similar morphologies, such as the bivalve, brachiopod,
and ostracod, it nevertheless obtained 0.88 precision. Our machine learning framework demonstrated
high accuracy with reproducibility and bias avoidance that was comparable to those of human classifiers.
Its application can thus eliminate much of the tedious, manually intensive efforts by human experts
conducting routine identification.

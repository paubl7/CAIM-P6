A collaborative network is a social network that is comprised of experts who cooperate with each
other to fulfill a special goal. Analyzing this network yields meaningful information about the
expertise of these experts and their subject areas. To perform the analysis, graph embedding techniques
have emerged as an effective and promising tool. Graph embedding attempts to represent graph nodes
as low-dimensional vectors. In this paper, we propose a graph embedding method, called ExEm, that
uses dominating-set theory and deep learning approaches to capture node representations. ExEm
finds dominating nodes of the collaborative network and constructs intelligent random walks that
comprise of at least two dominating nodes. One dominating node should appear at the beginning of
each path sampled to characterize the local neighborhoods. Moreover, the second dominating node
reflects the global structure information. To learn the node embeddings, ExEm exploits three embedding
methods including Word2vec, fastText and the concatenation of these two. The final result is the
low-dimensional vectors of experts, called expert embeddings. The extracted expert embeddings
can be applied to many applications. In order to extend these embeddings into the expert recommendation
system, we introduce a novel strategy that uses expert vectors to calculate experts' scores and
recommend experts. At the end, we conduct extensive experiments to validate the effectiveness
of ExEm through assessing its performance over the multi-label classification, link prediction,
and recommendation tasks on common datasets and our collected data formed by crawling the vast author
Scopus profiles. The experiments show that ExEm outperforms the baselines especially in dense
networks.

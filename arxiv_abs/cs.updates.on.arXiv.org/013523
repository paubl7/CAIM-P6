Computation Tree Logic of Knowledge (CTLK) can specify many design requirements of privacy and
security of multi-agent systems (MAS). In our conference paper, we defined Knowledge-oriented
Petri Nets (KPN) to model MAS and proposed Reachability Graphs with Equivalence Relations (RGER)
to verify CTLK. In this paper, we use the technique of Ordered Binary Decision Diagrams (OBDD) to
encode RGER in order to alleviate the state explosion problem and enhance the verification efficiency.
We propose a heuristic method to order those variables in OBDD, which can well improve the time and
space performance of producing, encoding and exploring a huge state space. More importantly, our
method does not produce and encode any transition or equivalence relation of states when producing
and encoding an RGER, and in fact it dynamically produces those transition or equivalence relations
that are required in the verification process of CTLK formulas. This policy can save a lot of time
and space since the number of transition or equivalence relations of states is much greater than
the number of states themselves. We design symbolic model checking algorithms, develop a tool and
apply them to two famous examples: Alice-Bob Protocol and Dining Cryptographers Protocol. We compare
our tool with MCMAS which is the state-of-the-art model checker of verifying CTLK. The experimental
results illustrate the advantages of our model and method. Our tool running in a general PC can totally
spend less than 14 hours to verify Dining Cryptographers Protocol with 1200 concurrent cryptographers
where there are about $10^{1080}$ states and the two verified CTLK formulas have more than 6000 atomic
propositions and more than 3600 operators. These good performances are owed to a combination of
the OBDD technique and the structure characteristics of KPN.

This paper presents a novel spatio-temporal LSTM (SPATIAL) architecture for time series forecasting
applied to environmental datasets. The framework was evaluated across multiple sensors and for
three different oceanic variables: current speed, temperature, and dissolved oxygen. Network
implementation proceeded in two directions that are nominally separated but connected as part
of a natural environmental system -- across the spatial (between individual sensors) and temporal
components of the sensor data. Data from four sensors sampling current speed, and eight measuring
both temperature and dissolved oxygen evaluated the framework. Results were compared against
RF and XGB baseline models that learned on the temporal signal of each sensor independently by extracting
the date-time features together with the past history of data using sliding window matrix. Results
demonstrated ability to accurately replicate complex signals and provide comparable performance
to state-of-the-art benchmarks. Notably, the novel framework provided a simpler pre-processing
and training pipeline that handles missing values via a simple masking layer. Enabling learning
across the spatial and temporal directions, this paper addresses two fundamental challenges of
ML applications to environmental science: 1) data sparsity and the challenges and costs of collecting
measurements of environmental conditions such as ocean dynamics, and 2) environmental datasets
are inherently connected in the spatial and temporal directions while classical ML approaches
only consider one of these directions. Furthermore, sharing of parameters across all input steps
makes SPATIAL a fast, scalable, and easily-parameterized forecasting framework.

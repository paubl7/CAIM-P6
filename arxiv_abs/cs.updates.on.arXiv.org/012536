In this paper, we introduce a generalization of graphlets to heterogeneous networks called typed
graphlets. Informally, typed graphlets are small typed induced subgraphs. Typed graphlets generalize
graphlets to rich heterogeneous networks as they explicitly capture the higher-order typed connectivity
patterns in such networks. To address this problem, we describe a general framework for counting
the occurrences of such typed graphlets. The proposed algorithms leverage a number of combinatorial
relationships for different typed graphlets. For each edge, we count a few typed graphlets, and
with these counts along with the combinatorial relationships, we obtain the exact counts of the
other typed graphlets in o(1) constant time. Notably, the worst-case time complexity of the proposed
approach matches the time complexity of the best known untyped algorithm. In addition, the approach
lends itself to an efficient lock-free and asynchronous parallel implementation. While there
are no existing methods for typed graphlets, there has been some work that focused on computing a
different and much simpler notion called colored graphlet. The experiments confirm that our proposed
approach is orders of magnitude faster and more space-efficient than methods for computing the
simpler notion of colored graphlet. Unlike these methods that take hours on small networks, the
proposed approach takes only seconds on large networks with millions of edges. Notably, since typed
graphlet is more general than colored graphlet (and untyped graphlets), the counts of various typed
graphlets can be combined to obtain the counts of the much simpler notion of colored graphlets. The
proposed methods give rise to new opportunities and applications for typed graphlets.

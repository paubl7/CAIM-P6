Sleep staging plays an important role on the diagnosis of sleep disorders. In general, experts classify
sleep stages manually based on polysomnography (PSG), which is quite time-consuming. Meanwhile,
the acquisition process of multiple signals is much complex, which can affect the subject's sleep.
Therefore, the use of single-channel electroencephalogram (EEG) for automatic sleep staging
has become a popular research topic. In the literature, a large number of sleep staging methods based
on single-channel EEG have been proposed with promising results and achieve the preliminary automation
of sleep staging. However, the performance for most of these methods in the N1 stage do not satisfy
the needs of the diagnosis. In this paper, we propose a deep learning model multi scale dual attention
network(MSDAN) based on raw EEG, which utilizes multi-scale convolution to extract features in
different waveforms contained in the EEG signal, connects channel attention and spatial attention
mechanisms in series to filter and highlight key information, and uses soft thresholding to remove
redundant information. Experiments were conducted using two datasets with 5-fold cross-validation
and hold-out validation method. The final average accuracy, overall accuracy, macro F1 score and
Cohen's Kappa coefficient of the model reach 96.70%, 91.74%, 0.8231 and 0.8723 on the Sleep-EDF
dataset, 96.14%, 90.35%, 0.7945 and 0.8284 on the Sleep-EDFx dataset. Significantly, our model
performed superiorly in the N1 stage, with F1 scores of 54.41% and 52.79% on the two datasets respectively.
The results show the superiority of our network over the existing methods, reaching a new state-of-the-art.
In particular, the proposed method achieves excellent results in the N1 sleep stage compared to
other methods.

Objective: We formed community structure based on web page credibility and we measured the types
of information for characterizing communities of tweeter users who posted about tweets related
to vaccine. Methods: We performed the experiment on only Twitter data (tweets) regarding vaccine.
The duration of data collection was between 17 January 2017 and 14 March 2018. We formulated cluster
based on the information on its contents and sources it resides (i.e., website domains). We only
focused the topics which were related to vaccine. To detect the structure and network of community,
we applied Louvain community algorithm along with Random walks called Info map method over vaccines
related tweeter user. We defined the communities based on various measures derived from the information
shared by Twitter users. Representations and visualizations of the communities based on these
derived measures help the public health organization to make understand the possible cause of the
rejecting the safety and efficacy of vaccines. Results: To analyse people perception over social
media, we downloaded 6,591,566 tweets. We distinguished 1,860,662 users who were posting related
to vaccine. We applied Louvain community detection algorithm along with DMM values and we found
192 communities. It also produced higher alignment values as long as the number of topics were low.
With the increase of topics number, the alignment becomes lower. The total tweets were divided into
two parts based on their characterizes. The first category contained 163,148 (57.16%) tweets which
were based as evidence and advocacy and the second category contained 6244 (2.19%) tweets which
were based on the experiences and opinion. We observed 4548 users were posting about experiential
tweets about vaccine and of them 3449 users (75.84%) were posted evidence and advocacy related.

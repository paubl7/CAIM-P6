Novelty detection in discrete sequences is a challenging task, since deviations from the process
generating the normal data are often small or intentionally hidden. Novelties can be detected by
modeling normal sequences and measuring the deviations of a new sequence from the model predictions.
However, in many applications data is generated by several distinct processes so that models trained
on all the data tend to over-generalize and novelties remain undetected. We propose to approach
this challenge through decomposition: by clustering the data we break down the problem, obtaining
simpler modeling task in each cluster which can be modeled more accurately. However, this comes
at a trade-off, since the amount of training data per cluster is reduced. This is a particular problem
for discrete sequences where state-of-the-art models are data-hungry. The success of this approach
thus depends on the quality of the clustering, i.e., whether the individual learning problems are
sufficiently simpler than the joint problem. While clustering discrete sequences automatically
is a challenging and domain-specific task, it is often easy for human domain experts, given the right
tools. In this paper, we adapt a state-of-the-art visual analytics tool for discrete sequence clustering
to obtain informed clusters from domain experts and use LSTMs to model each cluster individually.
Our extensive empirical evaluation indicates that this informed clustering outperforms automatic
ones and that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art novelty detection methods for discrete
sequences in three real-world application scenarios. In particular, decomposition outperforms
a global model despite less training data on each individual cluster.

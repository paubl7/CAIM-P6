The two leading hypotheses for the Galactic Center Excess (GCE) in the $\textit{Fermi}$ data are
an unresolved population of faint millisecond pulsars (MSPs) and dark-matter (DM) annihilation.
The dichotomy between these explanations is typically reflected by modeling them as two separate
emission components. However, point-sources (PSs) such as MSPs become statistically degenerate
with smooth Poisson emission in the ultra-faint limit (formally where each source is expected to
contribute much less than one photon on average), leading to an ambiguity that can render questions
such as whether the emission is PS-like or Poissonian in nature ill-defined. We present a conceptually
new approach that describes the PS and Poisson emission in a unified manner and only afterwards derives
constraints on the Poissonian component from the so obtained results. For the implementation of
this approach, we leverage deep learning techniques, centered around a neural network-based method
for histogram regression that expresses uncertainties in terms of quantiles. We demonstrate that
our method is robust against a number of systematics that have plagued previous approaches, in particular
DM / PS misattribution. In the $\textit{Fermi}$ data, we find a faint GCE described by a median source-count
distribution (SCD) peaked at a flux of $\sim4 \times 10^{-11} \ \text{counts} \ \text{cm}^{-2}
\ \text{s}^{-1}$ (corresponding to $\sim3 - 4$ expected counts per PS), which would require $N \sim
\mathcal{O}(10^4)$ sources to explain the entire excess (median value $N = \text{29,300}$ across
the sky). Although faint, this SCD allows us to derive the constraint $\eta_P \leq 66\%$ for the Poissonian
fraction of the GCE flux $\eta_P$ at 95% confidence, suggesting that a substantial amount of the
GCE flux is due to PSs.

One of the obstacles hindering the scaling-up of the initial successes of machine learning in practical
engineering applications is the dependence of the accuracy on the size of the database that "drives"
the algorithms. Incorporating the already-known physical laws into the training process can significantly
reduce the size of the required database. In this study, we establish a neural network-based computational
framework to characterize the finite deformation of elastic plates, which in classic theories
is described by the F\"oppl--von K\'arm\'an (FvK) equations with a set of boundary conditions (BCs).
A neural network is constructed by taking the spatial coordinates as the input and the displacement
field as the output to approximate the exact solution of the FvK equations. The physical information
(PDEs, BCs, and potential energies) is then incorporated into the loss function, and a pseudo dataset
is sampled without knowing the exact solution to finally train the neural network. The prediction
accuracy of the modeling framework is carefully examined by applying it to four different loading
cases: in-plane tension with non-uniformly distributed stretching forces, in-plane central-hole
tension, out-of-plane deflection, and buckling under compression. Two ways of formulating the
loss function are compared, one based on the PDEs and BCs, and the other based on the total potential
energy of the plate. Through the comparison with the finite element simulation results, it is found
that our computational framework is capable of characterizing the elastic deformation of plates
with a satisfactory accuracy. Compared with incorporating the PDEs and BCs in the loss, using the
total potential energy is a better way in terms of training accuracy and efficiency.

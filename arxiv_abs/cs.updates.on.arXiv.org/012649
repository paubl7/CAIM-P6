In spite of a growing body of scientific evidence on the effectiveness of individual face mask usage
for reducing transmission rates, individual face mask usage has become a highly polarized topic
within the United States. A series of policy shifts by various governmental bodies have been speculated
to have contributed to the polarization of face masks. A typical method to investigate the effects
of these policy shifts is to use surveys. However, survey-based approaches have multiple limitations:
biased responses, limited sample size, badly crafted questions may skew responses and inhibit
insight, and responses may prove quickly irrelevant as opinions change in response to a dynamic
topic. We propose a novel approach to 1) accurately gauge public sentiment towards face masks in
the United States during COVID-19 using a multi-modal demographic inference framework with topic
modeling and 2) determine whether face mask policy shifts contributed to polarization towards
face masks using offline change point analysis on Twitter data. First, we infer several key demographics
of individual Twitter users such as their age, gender, and whether they are a college student using
a multi-modal demographic prediction framework and analyze the average sentiment for each respective
demographic. Next, we conduct topic analysis using latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA). Finally,
we conduct offline change point discovery on our sentiment time series data using the Pruned Exact
Linear Time (PELT) search algorithm. Experimental results on a large corpus of Twitter data reveal
multiple insights regarding demographic sentiment towards face masks that agree with existing
surveys. Furthermore, we find two key policy-shift events contributed to statistically significant
changes in sentiment for both Republicans and Democrats.

The design of permissioned blockchains places an access control requirement for members to read,
access, and write information over the blockchains. In this paper, we study a hierarchical scenario
to include three types of participants: providers, collectors, and governors. To be specific,
providers forward transactions, collected from terminals, to collectors; collectors upload
received transactions to governors after verifying and labeling them; and governors validate
a part of received labeled transactions, pack valid ones into a block, and append a new block on the
ledger. Collectors in the hierarchical model play a crucial role in the design: they have connections
with both providers and governors, and are responsible for collecting, verifying, and uploading
transactions. However, collectors are rational and some of them may behave maliciously (not necessarily
for their own benefits). In this paper, we introduce a reputation protocol as a measure of the reliability
of collectors in the permissioned blockchain environment. Its objective is to encourage collectors
to behave truthfully and, in addition, to reduce the verification cost. The verification cost on
provider $p$ is defined as the total number of invalid transactions provided by $p$ and checked by
governors. Through theoretical analysis, our protocol with the reputation mechanism has a significant
improvement in efficiency. Specifically, the verification loss that governors suffer is proved
to be asymptotically $O(\sqrt{T_{total}})$ ($T_{total}$, representing the number of transactions
verified by governors and provided by $p$), as long as there exists at least one collector who behaves
well. At last, two typical cases where our model can be well applied are also demonstrated.

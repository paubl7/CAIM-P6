Point signature, a representation describing the structural neighborhood of a point in 3D shapes,
can be applied to establish correspondences between points in 3D shapes. Conventional methods
apply a weight-sharing network, e.g., any kind of graph neural networks, across all neighborhoods
to directly generate point signatures and gain the generalization ability by extensive training
over a large amount of training samples from scratch. However, these methods lack the flexibility
in rapidly adapting to unseen neighborhood structures and thus generalizes poorly on new point
sets. In this paper, we propose a novel meta-learning based 3D point signature model, named 3Dmetapointsignature
(MEPS) network, that is capable of learning robust point signatures in 3D shapes. By regarding each
point signature learning process as a task, our method obtains an optimized model over the best performance
on the distribution of all tasks, generating reliable signatures for new tasks, i.e., signatures
of unseen point neighborhoods. Specifically, the MEPS consists of two modules: a base signature
learner and a meta signature learner. During training, the base-learner is trained to perform specific
signature learning tasks. In the meantime, the meta-learner is trained to update the base-learner
with optimal parameters. During testing, the meta-learner that is learned with the distribution
of all tasks can adaptively change parameters of the base-learner, accommodating to unseen local
neighborhoods. We evaluate the MEPS model on two datasets, e.g., FAUST and TOSCA, for dense 3Dshape
correspondence. Experimental results demonstrate that our method not only gains significant
improvements over the baseline model and achieves state-of-the-art results, but also is capable
of handling unseen 3D shapes.

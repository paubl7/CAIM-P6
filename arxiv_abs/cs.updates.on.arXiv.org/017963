Both NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and the JAXA/NASA Hinode mission include spectropolarimetric
instruments designed to measure the photospheric magnetic field. SDO's Helioseismic and Magnetic
Imager (HMI) emphasizes full-disk high-cadence and good spatial resolution data acquisition
while Hinode's Solar Optical Telescope Spectro-Polarimeter (SOT-SP) focuses on high spatial
resolution and spectral sampling at the cost of a limited field of view and slower temporal cadence.
This work introduces a deep-learning system named SynthIA (Synthetic Inversion Approximation),
that can enhance both missions by capturing the best of each instrument's characteristics. We use
SynthIA to produce a new magnetogram data product, SynodeP (Synthetic Hinode Pipeline), that mimics
magnetograms from the higher spectral resolution Hinode/SOT-SP pipeline, but is derived from
full-disk, high-cadence, and lower spectral-resolution SDO/HMI Stokes observations. Results
on held-out data show that SynodeP has good agreement with the Hinode/SOT-SP pipeline inversions,
including magnetic fill fraction, which is not provided by the current SDO/HMI pipeline. SynodeP
further shows a reduction in the magnitude of the 24-hour oscillations present in the SDO/HMI data.
To demonstrate SynthIA's generality, we show the use of SDO/AIA data and subsets of the HMI data as
inputs, which enables trade-offs between fidelity to the Hinode/SOT-SP inversions, number of
observations used, and temporal artifacts. We discuss possible generalizations of SynthIA and
its implications for space weather modeling. This work is part of the NASA Heliophysics DRIVE Science
Center (SOLSTICE) at the University of Michigan under grant NASA 80NSSC20K0600E, and will be open-sourced.

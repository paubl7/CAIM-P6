Nowadays, deep learning methods, especially the Graph Convolutional Network (GCN), have shown
impressive performance in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. However, the current GCN-based
methods treat graph construction and image classification as two separate tasks, which often results
in suboptimal performance. Another defect of these methods is that they mainly focus on modeling
the local pairwise importance between graph nodes while lack the capability to capture the global
contextual information of HSI. In this paper, we propose a Multi-level GCN with Automatic Graph
Learning method (MGCN-AGL) for HSI classification, which can automatically learn the graph information
at both local and global levels. By employing attention mechanism to characterize the importance
among spatially neighboring regions, the most relevant information can be adaptively incorporated
to make decisions, which helps encode the spatial context to form the graph information at local
level. Moreover, we utilize multiple pathways for local-level graph convolution, in order to leverage
the merits from the diverse spatial context of HSI and to enhance the expressive power of the generated
representations. To reconstruct the global contextual relations, our MGCN-AGL encodes the long
range dependencies among image regions based on the expressive representations that have been
produced at local level. Then inference can be performed along the reconstructed graph edges connecting
faraway regions. Finally, the multi-level information is adaptively fused to generate the network
output. In this means, the graph learning and image classification can be integrated into a unified
framework and benefit each other. Extensive experiments have been conducted on three real-world
hyperspectral datasets, which are shown to outperform the state-of-the-art methods.

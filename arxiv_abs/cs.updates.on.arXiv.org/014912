We consider a novel formulation of the dynamic pricing and demand learning problem, where the evolution
of demand in response to posted prices is governed by a stochastic variant of the popular Bass model
with parameters $\alpha, \beta$ that are linked to the so-called "innovation" and "imitation"
effects. Unlike the more commonly used i.i.d. and contextual demand models, in this model the posted
price not only affects the demand and the revenue in the current round but also the future evolution
of demand, and hence the fraction of potential market size $m$ that can be ultimately captured. In
this paper, we consider the more challenging incomplete information problem where dynamic pricing
is applied in conjunction with learning the unknown parameters, with the objective of optimizing
the cumulative revenues over a given selling horizon of length $T$. Equivalently, the goal is to
minimize the regret which measures the revenue loss of the algorithm relative to the optimal expected
revenue achievable under the stochastic Bass model with market size $m$ and time horizon $T$. Our
main contribution is the development of an algorithm that satisfies a high probability regret guarantee
of order $\tilde O(m^{2/3})$; where the market size $m$ is known a priori. Moreover, we show that
no algorithm can incur smaller order of loss by deriving a matching lower bound. Unlike most regret
analysis results, in the present problem the market size $m$ is the fundamental driver of the complexity;
our lower bound in fact, indicates that for any fixed $\alpha, \beta$, most non-trivial instances
of the problem have constant $T$ and large $m$. We believe that this insight sets the problem of dynamic
pricing under the Bass model apart from the typical i.i.d. setting and multi-armed bandit based
models for dynamic pricing, which typically focus only on the asymptotics with respect to time horizon
$T$.

Utilities around the world are reported to invest a total of around 30 billion over the next few years
for installation of more than 300 million smart meters, replacing traditional analog meters [1].
By mid-decade, with full country wide deployment, there will be almost 1.3 billion smart meters
in place [1]. Collection of fine grained energy usage data by these smart meters provides numerous
advantages such as energy savings for customers with use of demand optimization, a billing system
of higher accuracy with dynamic pricing programs, bidirectional information exchange ability
between end-users for better consumer-operator interaction, and so on. However, all these perks
associated with fine grained energy usage data collection threaten the privacy of users. With this
technology, customers' personal data such as sleeping cycle, number of occupants, and even type
and number of appliances stream into the hands of the utility companies and can be subject to misuse.
This research paper addresses privacy violation of consumers' energy usage data collected from
smart meters and provides a novel solution for the privacy protection while allowing benefits of
energy data analytics. First, we demonstrate the successful application of occupancy detection
attacks using a deep neural network method that yields high accuracy results. We then introduce
Adversarial Machine Learning Occupancy Detection Avoidance with Blockchain (AMLODA-B) framework
as a counter-attack by deploying an algorithm based on the Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) model into
the standardized smart metering infrastructure to prevent leakage of consumers personal information.
Our privacy-aware approach protects consumers' privacy without compromising the correctness
of billing and preserves operational efficiency without use of authoritative intermediaries.

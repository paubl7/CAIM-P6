We propose a visualization application, designed for the exploration of human spine simulation
data. Our goal is to support research in biomechanical spine simulation and advance efforts to implement
simulation-backed analysis in surgical applications. Biomechanical simulation is a state-of-the-art
technique for analyzing load distributions of spinal structures. Through the inclusion of patient-specific
data, such simulations may facilitate personalized treatment and customized surgical interventions.
Difficulties in spine modelling and simulation can be partly attributed to poor result representation,
which may also be a hindrance when introducing such techniques into a clinical environment. Comparisons
of measurements across multiple similar anatomical structures and the integration of temporal
data make commonly available diagrams and charts insufficient for an intuitive and systematic
display of results. Therefore, we facilitate methods such as multiple coordinated views, abstraction
and focus and context to display simulation outcomes in a dedicated tool. By linking the result data
with patient-specific anatomy, we make relevant parameters tangible for clinicians. Furthermore,
we introduce new concepts to show the directions of impact force vectors, which were not accessible
before. We integrated our toolset into a spine segmentation and simulation pipeline and evaluated
our methods with both surgeons and biomechanical researchers. When comparing our methods against
standard representations that are currently in use, we found increases in accuracy and speed in
data exploration tasks. In a qualitative review, domain experts deemed the tool highly useful when
dealing with simulation result data, which typically combines time-dependent patient movement
and the resulting force distributions on spinal structures.

Cellular and molecular imaging techniques and models have been developed to characterize single
stages of viral proliferation after focal infection of cells in vitro. The fast and automatic classification
of cell imaging data may prove helpful prior to any further comparison of representative experimental
data to mathematical models of viral propagation in host cells. Here, we use computer generated
images drawn from a reproduction of an imaging model from a previously published study of experimentally
obtained cell imaging data representing progressive viral particle proliferation in host cell
monolayers. Inspired by experimental time-based imaging data, here in this study viral particle
increase in time is simulated by a one-by-one increase, across images, in black or gray single pixels
representing dead or partially infected cells, and hypothetical remission by a one-by-one increase
in white pixels coding for living cells in the original image model. The image simulations are submitted
to unsupervised learning by a Self-Organizing Map (SOM) and the Quantization Error in the SOM output
(SOM-QE) is used for automatic classification of the image simulations as a function of the represented
extent of viral particle proliferation or cell recovery. Unsupervised classification by SOM-QE
of 160 model images, each with more than three million pixels, is shown to provide a statistically
reliable, pixel precise, and fast classification model that outperforms human computer-assisted
image classification by RGB image mean computation. The automatic classification procedure proposed
here provides a powerful approach to understand finely tuned mechanisms in the infection and proliferation
of virus in cell lines in vitro or other cells.

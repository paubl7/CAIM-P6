Data-driven fault diagnostics of safety-critical systems often faces the challenge of a complete
lack of labeled data associated with faulty system conditions (i.e., fault types) at training time.
Since an unknown number and nature of fault types can arise during deployment, data-driven fault
diagnostics in this scenario is an open-set learning problem. Most of the algorithms for open-set
diagnostics are one-class classification and unsupervised algorithms that do not leverage all
the available labeled and unlabeled data in the learning algorithm. As a result, their fault detection
and segmentation performance (i.e., identifying and separating faults of different types) are
sub-optimal. With this work, we propose training a variational autoencoder (VAE) with labeled
and unlabeled samples while inducing implicit supervision on the latent representation of the
healthy conditions. This, together with a modified sampling process of VAE, creates a compact and
informative latent representation that allows good detection and segmentation of unseen fault
types using existing one-class and clustering algorithms. We refer to the proposed methodology
as "knowledge induced variational autoencoder with adaptive sampling" (KIL-AdaVAE). The fault
detection and segmentation capabilities of the proposed methodology are demonstrated in a new
simulated case study using the Advanced Geared Turbofan 30000 (AGTF30) dynamical model under real
flight conditions. In an extensive comparison, we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms
other learning strategies (supervised learning, supervised learning with embedding and semi-supervised
learning) and deep learning algorithms, yielding significant performance improvements on fault
detection and fault segmentation.

OBJECTIVE: Leverage existing biomedical NLP tools and DS domain terminology to produce a novel
and comprehensive knowledge graph containing dietary supplement (DS) information for discovering
interactions between DS and drugs, or Drug-Supplement Interactions (DSI). MATERIALS AND METHODS:
We created SemRepDS (an extension of SemRep), capable of extracting semantic relations from abstracts
by leveraging a DS-specific terminology (iDISK) containing 28,884 DS terms not found in the UMLS.
PubMed abstracts were processed using SemRepDS to generate semantic relations, which were then
filtered using a PubMedBERT-based model to remove incorrect relations before generating our knowledge
graph (SuppKG). Two pathways are used to identify potential DS-Drug interactions which are then
evaluated by medical professionals for mechanistic plausibility. RESULTS: Comparison analysis
found that SemRepDS returned 206.9% more DS relations and 158.5% more DS entities than SemRep. The
fine-tuned BERT model obtained an F1 score of 0.8605 and removed 43.86% of the relations, improving
the precision of the relations by 26.4% compared to pre-filtering. SuppKG consists of 2,928 DS-specific
nodes. Manual review of findings identified 44 (88%) proposed DS-Gene-Drug and 32 (64%) proposed
DS-Gene1-Function-Gene2-Drug pathways to be mechanistically plausible. DISCUSSION: The additional
relations extracted using SemRepDS generated SuppKG that was used to find plausible DSI not found
in the current literature. By the nature of the SuppKG, these interactions are unlikely to have been
found using SemRep without the expanded DS terminology. CONCLUSION: We successfully extend SemRep
to include DS information and produce SuppKG which can be used to find potential DS-Drug interactions.

The world is going through a challenging phase due to the disastrous effect caused by the COVID-19
pandemic on the healthcare system and the economy. The rate of spreading, post-COVID-19 symptoms,
and the occurrence of new strands of COVID-19 have put the healthcare systems in disruption across
the globe. Due to this, the task of accurately screening COVID-19 cases has become of utmost priority.
Since the virus infects the respiratory system, Chest X-Ray is an imaging modality that is adopted
extensively for the initial screening. We have performed a comprehensive study that uses CXR images
to identify COVID-19 cases and realized the necessity of having a more generalizable model. We utilize
MobileNetV2 architecture as the feature extractor and integrate it into Capsule Networks to construct
a fully automated and lightweight model termed as MobileCaps. MobileCaps is trained and evaluated
on the publicly available dataset with the model ensembling and Bayesian optimization strategies
to efficiently classify CXR images of patients with COVID-19 from non-COVID-19 pneumonia and healthy
cases. The proposed model is further evaluated on two additional RT-PCR confirmed datasets to demonstrate
the generalizability. We also introduce MobileCaps-S and leverage it for performing severity
assessment of CXR images of COVID-19 based on the Radiographic Assessment of Lung Edema (RALE) scoring
technique. Our classification model achieved an overall recall of 91.60, 94.60, 92.20, and a precision
of 98.50, 88.21, 92.62 for COVID-19, non-COVID-19 pneumonia, and healthy cases, respectively.
Further, the severity assessment model attained an R$^2$ coefficient of 70.51. Owing to the fact
that the proposed models have fewer trainable parameters than the state-of-the-art models reported
in the literature, we believe our models will go a long way in aiding healthcare systems in the battle
against the pandemic.

The newly discovered Corona virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) has been globally spreading and causing
hundreds of thousands of deaths around the world as of its first emergence in late 2019. Computed
tomography (CT) scans have shown distinctive features and higher sensitivity compared to other
diagnostic tests, in particular the current gold standard, i.e., the Reverse Transcription Polymerase
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR) test. Current deep learning-based algorithms are mainly developed based
on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to identify COVID-19 pneumonia cases. CNNs, however,
require extensive data augmentation and large datasets to identify detailed spatial relations
between image instances. Furthermore, existing algorithms utilizing CT scans, either extend
slice-level predictions to patient-level ones using a simple thresholding mechanism or rely on
a sophisticated infection segmentation to identify the disease. In this paper, we propose a two-stage
fully-automated CT-based framework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases referred to
as the "COVID-FACT". COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks and is,
therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to make the proposed COVID-FACT
independent from sophisticated segmentation of the area of infection, slices demonstrating infection
are detected at the first stage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into
COVID and non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies positive
COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia,
and normal cases. Based on our experiments, COVID-FACT achieves an accuracy of 90.82%, a sensitivity
of 94.55%, a specificity of 86.04%, and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.98, while depending on far
less supervision and annotation, in comparison to its counterparts.

It has been an exciting journey since the mobile communications and artificial intelligence were
conceived 37 years and 64 years ago. While both fields evolved independently and profoundly changed
communications and computing industries, the rapid convergence of 5G and deep learning is beginning
to significantly transform the core communication infrastructure, network management and vertical
applications. The paper first outlines the individual roadmaps of mobile communications and artificial
intelligence in the early stage, with a concentration to review the era from 3G to 5G when AI and mobile
communications started to converge. With regard to telecommunications artificial intelligence,
the paper further introduces in detail the progress of artificial intelligence in the ecosystem
of mobile communications. The paper then summarizes the classifications of AI in telecom ecosystems
along with its evolution paths specified by various international telecommunications standardization
bodies. Towards the next decade, the paper forecasts the prospective roadmap of telecommunications
artificial intelligence. In line with 3GPP and ITU-R timeline of 5G & 6G, the paper further explores
the network intelligence following 3GPP and ORAN routes respectively, experience and intention
driven network management and operation, network AI signalling system, intelligent middle-office
based BSS, intelligent customer experience management and policy control driven by BSS and OSS
convergence, evolution from SLA to ELA, and intelligent private network for verticals. The paper
is concluded with the vision that AI will reshape the future B5G or 6G landscape and we need pivot our
R&D, standardizations, and ecosystem to fully take the unprecedented opportunities.

Autonomous navigation consists in an agent being able to navigate without human intervention or
supervision, it affects both high level planning and low level control. Navigation is at the crossroad
of multiple disciplines, it combines notions of computer vision, robotics and control. This work
aimed at creating, in a simulation, a navigation pipeline whose transfer to the real world could
be done with as few efforts as possible. Given the limited time and the wide range of problematic to
be tackled, absolute navigation performances while important was not the main objective. The emphasis
was rather put on studying the sim2real gap which is one the major bottlenecks of modern robotics
and autonomous navigation. To design the navigation pipeline four main challenges arise; environment,
localization, navigation and planning. The iGibson simulator is picked for its photo-realistic
textures and physics engine. A topological approach to tackle space representation was picked
over metric approaches because they generalize better to new environments and are less sensitive
to change of conditions. The navigation pipeline is decomposed as a localization module, a planning
module and a local navigation module. These modules utilize three different networks, an image
representation extractor, a passage detector and a local policy. The laters are trained on specifically
tailored tasks with some associated datasets created for those specific tasks. Localization is
the ability for the agent to localize itself against a specific space representation. It must be
reliable, repeatable and robust to a wide variety of transformations. Localization is tackled
as an image retrieval task using a deep neural network trained on an auxiliary task as a feature descriptor
extractor. The local policy is trained with behavioral cloning from expert trajectories gathered
with ROS navigation stack.

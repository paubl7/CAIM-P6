In a traditional $(H, r)$ combination network, each user is connected to a unique set of $r$ relays.
However, few research efforts to consider $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network problem
where each $u$ users are connected to a unique set of $r$ relays. A naive strategy to obtain a coded
caching scheme for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is by $u$ times repeated application
of a coded caching scheme for a traditional $(H, r)$ combination network. Obviously, the transmission
load for each relay of this trivial scheme is exactly $u$ times that of the original scheme, which
implies that as the number of users multiplies, the transmission load for each relay will also multiply.
Therefore, it is very meaningful to design a coded caching scheme for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination
network with lower transmission load for each relay. In this paper, by directly applying the well
known coding method (proposed by Zewail and Yener) for $(H, r)$ combination network, a coded caching
scheme (ZY scheme) for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is obtained. However, the subpacketization
of this scheme has exponential order with the number of users, which leads to a high implementation
complexity. In order to reduce the subpacketization, a direct construction of a coded caching scheme
for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is proposed by means of Combinational Design Theory,
where the parameter $u$ must be a combinatorial number. For arbitrary parameter $u$, a hybrid construction
of a coded caching scheme for $(H, r, u)$ multiaccess combination network is proposed based on our
direct construction. Theoretical and numerical analysis show that our last two schemes have smaller
transmission load for each relay compared with the trivial scheme, and have much lower subpacketization
compared with ZY scheme.

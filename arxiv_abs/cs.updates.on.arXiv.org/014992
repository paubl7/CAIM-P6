Digital twins are emerging in many industries, typically consisting of simulation models and data
associated with a specific physical system. One of the main reasons for developing a digital twin,
is to enable the simulation of possible consequences of a given action, without the need to interfere
with the physical system itself. Physical systems of interest, and the environments they operate
in, do not always behave deterministically. Moreover, information about the system and its environment
is typically incomplete or imperfect. Probabilistic representations of systems and environments
may therefore be called for, especially to support decisions in application areas where actions
may have severe consequences. In this paper we introduce the probabilistic digital twin (PDT).
We will start by discussing how epistemic uncertainty can be treated using measure theory, by modelling
epistemic information via $\sigma$-algebras. Based on this, we give a formal definition of how
epistemic uncertainty can be updated in a PDT. We then study the problem of optimal sequential decision
making. That is, we consider the case where the outcome of each decision may inform the next. Within
the PDT framework, we formulate this optimization problem. We discuss how this problem may be solved
(at least in theory) via the maximum principle method or the dynamic programming principle. However,
due to the curse of dimensionality, these methods are often not tractable in practice. To mend this,
we propose a generic approximate solution using deep reinforcement learning together with neural
networks defined on sets. We illustrate the method on a practical problem, considering optimal
information gathering for the estimation of a failure probability.

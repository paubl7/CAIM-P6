Automated inspection plays an important role in monitoring large-scale photovoltaic power plants.
Commonly, electroluminescense measurements are used to identify various types of defects on solar
modules but have not been used to determine the power of a module. However, knowledge of the power
at maximum power point is important as well, since drops in the power of a single module can affect
the performance of an entire string. By now, this is commonly determined by measurements that require
to discontact or even dismount the module, rendering a regular inspection of individual modules
infeasible. In this work, we bridge the gap between electroluminescense measurements and the power
determination of a module. We compile a large dataset of 719 electroluminescense measurementsof
modules at various stages of degradation, especially cell cracks and fractures, and the corresponding
power at maximum power point. Here,we focus on inactive regions and cracks as the predominant type
of defect. We set up a baseline regression model to predict the power from electroluminescense measurements
with a mean absolute error of 9.0+/-3.7$W_P$ (4.0+/-8.4%). Then, we show that deep-learning can
be used to train a model that performs significantly better (7.3+/-2.7$W_P$ or 3.2+/-6.5%) and
propose a variant of class activation maps to obtain the per cell power loss, as predicted by the model.
With this work, we aim to open a new research topic. Therefore, we publicly release the dataset, the
code and trained models to empower other researchers to compare against our results. Finally, we
present a thorough evaluation of certain boundary conditions like the dataset size and an automated
preprocessing pipeline for on-site measurements showing multiple modules at once.

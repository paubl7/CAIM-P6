Context. Requirements engineering remains a discipline that is faced with a large number of challenges,
including the implementation of a requirements elicitation process in industry. Although several
proposals have been suggested by researchers and academics, little is known of the practices that
are actually followed in industry. Objective. We investigate the SoTA with respect to requirements
elicitation, examining practitioners' practices. We focus on the techniques, the roles involved,
and the challenges associated to the process. Method. We conducted an interview-based survey study
involving 24 practitioners from 12 different Swedish IT companies. Results. We found that group
interaction techniques, including meetings and workshops, are the most popular type of elicitation
techniques that are employed by the practitioners, except in the case of small projects. We noted
that customers are frequently involved in the elicitation process, except in the case of market-driven
organizations. Technical staff (for example, developers and architects) are more frequently
involved in the elicitation process compared to the involvement of business- or strategic staff.
Finally, we identified a number of challenges with respect to stakeholders. These challenges include
difficulties in understanding and prioritizing their needs. Further, it was noted that requirements
instability (i.e., caused by changing needs or priorities) was a predominant challenge. These
observations need to be interpreted in the context of the study. Conclusion. The relevant observations
regarding the survey participants' experiences should be of interest to the industry; experiences
that should be analyzed in the practitioners' context. Researchers may find evidence for the use
of academic results in practice, thereby inspiring future theoretical work, as well as further
empirical studies in the same area.

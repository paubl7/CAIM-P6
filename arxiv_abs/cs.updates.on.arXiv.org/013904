IFOSMONDI iterative algorithm for implicit co-simulation of coupled physical systems (introduced
by the authors in july 2019 during the Simultech conference, p.176-186) enables us to solve the nonlinear
coupling function while keeping the smoothness of interfaces without introducing a delay. Moreover,
it automatically adapts the size of the steps between data exchanges among the systems according
to the difficulty of the solving of the coupling constraint. The latter was solved by a fixed-point
algorithm in the original implementation whereas this paper introduces the JFM version (standing
for Jacobian-Free Methods). Most implementations of Newton-like methods require a jacobian matrix
which can be difficult to compute in the co-simulation context, except in the case where the interfaces
are represented by a Zero-Order-Hold (ZOH). As far as IFOSMONDI coupling algorithm uses Hermite
interpolation for smoothness enhancement (up to Third-Order-Hold), we propose hereafter a new
formulation of the non-linear coupling function including both the values and the time-derivatives
of the coupling variables. This formulation is well designed for solving the coupling through jacobian-free
Newton type methods. Consequently, successive function evaluations consist in multiple simulations
of the systems on a co-simulation time step using rollback. The orchestrator-workers structure
of the algorithm enables us to combine the PETSc framework on the orchestrator side for the non-linear
Newton-type solvers with the parallel integrations of the systems on the workers side thanks to
MPI processes. Different nonlinear methods will be compared to one another and to the original fixed-point
implementation on a newly proposed 2-systems academic test-case (mass-spring-damper type) with
direct feedthrough on both sides.

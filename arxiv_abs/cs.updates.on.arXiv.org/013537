We study the coarse-grained selection module in retrieval-based chatbot. Coarse-grained selection
is a basic module in a retrieval-based chatbot, which constructs a rough candidate set from the whole
database to speed up the interaction with customers. So far, there are two kinds of approaches for
coarse-grained selection module: (1) sparse representation; (2) dense representation. To the
best of our knowledge, there is no systematic comparison between these two approaches in retrieval-based
chatbots, and which kind of method is better in real scenarios is still an open question. In this paper,
we first systematically compare these two methods from four aspects: (1) effectiveness; (2) index
stoarge; (3) search time cost; (4) human evaluation. Extensive experiment results demonstrate
that dense representation method significantly outperforms the sparse representation, but costs
more time and storage occupation. In order to overcome these fatal weaknesses of dense representation
method, we propose an ultra-fast, low-storage, and highly effective Deep Semantic Hashing Coarse-grained
selection method, called DSHC model. Specifically, in our proposed DSHC model, a hashing optimizing
module that consists of two autoencoder models is stacked on a trained dense representation model,
and three loss functions are designed to optimize it. The hash codes provided by hashing optimizing
module effectively preserve the rich semantic and similarity information in dense vectors. Extensive
experiment results prove that, our proposed DSHC model can achieve much faster speed and lower storage
than sparse representation, with limited performance loss compared with dense representation.
Besides, our source codes have been publicly released for future research.

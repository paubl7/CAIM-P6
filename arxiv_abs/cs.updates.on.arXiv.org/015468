In agreements among anonymous users, smart contract eliminate the need for a trusted intermediary
and enforce its terms when the conditions set by the parties are met. Smart contracts can also have
access to real-world data through oracle services, an emerging feature of smart contract systems.
This means that anonymous users can bet on an event and the financial benefit gives them the incentive
to contribute to that event occurrence. More specifically, a smart contract stimulates new forms
of trustless collaboration through betting. This encourages collaborative work in the context
of distributed digital service, e.g., content distribution or file storage but it can be used for
collaborative attacks (e.g., DDoS) since users need neither trust anybody nor reveal their identity.
In this paper, we present a collaboration framework based on an incentive mechanism implemented
in a smart contract. To explore the feasibility of malicious collaboration, we the case of a collaborative
distributed denial of service attack in which multiple minibotnet bet on a sponsored DDoS attack.
The attackers' interaction is formulated as a game and it's shown that the attackers will collaborate
in proportion to the amount of their bets. There is a possibility that a user pretends to be several
parties, it is hard to know the exact number of bidding users or the amount of their bids, which are
essential for predicting the attack result. We model the proposed smart contract as an incentive
mechanism and prove that users will not misrepresent the amount of their bets. So based on each user's
amount of bet and the attack result (reported by the oracle), each user's share of reward is calculated.
The numerical simulations show that if the attack-target uses the attack details to prepare and
defend, by increasing the cost of producing effective attack traffic, they can change the result
and so prevent such attack.

Brain connectivity networks, derived from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), non-invasively
quantify the relationship in function, structure, and morphology between two brain regions of
interest (ROIs) and give insights into gender-related connectional differences. However, to
the best of our knowledge, studies on gender differences in brain connectivity were limited to investigating
pairwise (i.e., low-order) relationship ROIs, overlooking the complex high-order interconnectedness
of the brain as a network. To address this limitation, brain multiplexes have been introduced to
model the relationship between at least two different brain networks. However, this inhibits their
application to datasets with single brain networks such as functional networks. To fill this gap,
we propose the first work on predicting brain multiplexes from a source network to investigate gender
differences. Recently, generative adversarial networks (GANs) submerged the field of medical
data synthesis. However, although conventional GANs work well on images, they cannot handle brain
networks due to their non-Euclidean topological structure. Differently, in this paper, we tap
into the nascent field of geometric-GANs (G-GAN) to design a deep multiplex prediction architecture
comprising (i) a geometric source to target network translator mimicking a U-Net architecture
with skip connections and (ii) a conditional discriminator which classifies predicted target
intra-layers by conditioning on the multiplex source intra-layers. Such architecture simultaneously
learns the latent source network representation and the deep non-linear mapping from the source
to target multiplex intra-layers. Our experiments on a large dataset demonstrated that predicted
multiplexes significantly boost gender classification accuracy compared with source networks
and identifies both low and high-order gender-specific multiplex connections.

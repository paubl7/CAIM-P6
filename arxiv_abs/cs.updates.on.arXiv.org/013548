Tree based ensembles such as Breiman's random forest (RF) and Gradient Boosted Trees (GBT) can be
interpreted as implicit kernel generators, where the ensuing proximity matrix represents the
data-driven tree ensemble kernel. Kernel perspective on the RF has been used to develop a principled
framework for theoretical investigation of its statistical properties. Recently, it has been
shown that the kernel interpretation is germane to other tree-based ensembles e.g. GBTs. However,
practical utility of the links between kernels and the tree ensembles has not been widely explored
and systematically evaluated. Focus of our work is investigation of the interplay between kernel
methods and the tree based ensembles including the RF and GBT. We elucidate the performance and properties
of the RF and GBT based kernels in a comprehensive simulation study comprising of continuous and
binary targets. We show that for continuous targets, the RF/GBT kernels are competitive to their
respective ensembles in higher dimensional scenarios, particularly in cases with larger number
of noisy features. For the binary target, the RF/GBT kernels and their respective ensembles exhibit
comparable performance. We provide the results from real life data sets for regression and classification
to show how these insights may be leveraged in practice. Overall, our results support the tree ensemble
based kernels as a valuable addition to the practitioner's toolbox. Finally, we discuss extensions
of the tree ensemble based kernels for survival targets, interpretable prototype and landmarking
classification and regression. We outline future line of research for kernels furnished by Bayesian
counterparts of the frequentist tree ensembles.

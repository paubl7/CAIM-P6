We analyse the impact of the selective pressure for the global optimisation capabilities of steady-state
EAs. For the standard bimodal benchmark function \twomax we rigorously prove that using uniform
parent selection leads to exponential runtimes with high probability to locate both optima for
the standard ($\mu$+1)~EA and ($\mu$+1)~RLS with any polynomial population sizes. On the other
hand, we prove that selecting the worst individual as parent leads to efficient global optimisation
with overwhelming probability for reasonable population sizes. Since always selecting the worst
individual may have detrimental effects for escaping from local optima, we consider the performance
of stochastic parent selection operators with low selective pressure for a function class called
\textsc{TruncatedTwoMax} where one slope is shorter than the other. An experimental analysis
shows that the EAs equipped with inverse tournament selection, where the loser is selected for reproduction
and small tournament sizes, globally optimise \textsc{TwoMax} efficiently and effectively escape
from local optima of \textsc{TruncatedTwoMax} with high probability. Thus they identify both
optima efficiently while uniform (or stronger) selection fails in theory and in practice. We then
show the power of inverse selection on function classes from the literature where populations are
essential by providing rigorous proofs or experimental evidence that it outperforms uniform selection
equipped with or without a restart strategy. We conclude the paper by confirming our theoretical
insights with an empirical analysis of the different selective pressures on standard benchmarks
of the classical MaxSat and Multidimensional Knapsack Problems.

A significant portion of the data available today is found within tables. Therefore, it is necessary
to use automated table extraction to obtain thorough results when data-mining. Today's popular
state-of-the-art methods for table extraction struggle to adequately extract tables with machine-readable
text and structural data. To make matters worse, many tables do not have machine-readable data,
such as tables saved as images, making most extraction methods completely ineffective. In order
to address these issues, a novel, general format table extractor tool, Tablext, is proposed. This
tool uses a combination of computer vision techniques and machine learning methods to efficiently
and effectively identify and extract data from tables. Tablext begins by using a custom Convolutional
Neural Network (CNN) to identify and separate all potential tables. The identification process
is optimized by combining the custom CNN with the YOLO object detection network. Then, the high-level
structure of each table is identified with computer vision methods. This high-level, structural
meta-data is used by another CNN to identify exact cell locations. As a final step, Optical Characters
Recognition (OCR) is performed on every individual cell to extract their content without needing
machine-readable text. This multi-stage algorithm allows for the neural networks to focus on completing
complex tasks, while letting image processing methods efficiently complete the simpler ones.
This leads to the proposed approach to be general-purpose enough to handle a large batch of tables
regardless of their internal encodings or their layout complexity. Additionally, it becomes accurate
enough to outperform competing state-of-the-art table extractors on the ICDAR 2013 table dataset.

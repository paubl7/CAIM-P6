In the author's PhD thesis (2019) universal envelopes were introduced as a tool for studying the
continuously obtainable information on discontinuous functions. To any function $f \colon X \to
Y$ between $\operatorname{qcb}_0$-spaces one can assign a so-called universal envelope which,
in a well-defined sense, encodes all continuously obtainable information on the function. A universal
envelope consists of two continuous functions $F \colon X \to L$ and $\xi_L \colon Y \to L$ with values
in a $\Sigma$-split injective space $L$. Any continuous function with values in an injective space
whose composition with the original function is again continuous factors through the universal
envelope. However, it is not possible in general to uniformly compute this factorisation. In this
paper we propose the notion of uniform envelopes. A uniform envelope is additionally endowed with
a map $u_L \colon L \to \mathcal{O}^2(Y)$ that is compatible with the multiplication of the double
powerspace monad $\mathcal{O}^2$ in a certain sense. This yields for every continuous map with
values in an injective space a choice of uniformly computable extension. Under a suitable condition
which we call uniform universality, this extension yields a uniformly computable solution for
the above factorisation problem. Uniform envelopes can be endowed with a composition operation.
We establish criteria that ensure that the composition of two uniformly universal envelopes is
again uniformly universal. These criteria admit a partial converse and we provide evidence that
they cannot be easily improved in general. Not every function admits a uniformly universal uniform
envelope. We can however assign to every function a canonical envelope that is in some sense as close
as possible to a uniform envelope. We obtain a composition theorem similar to the uniform case.

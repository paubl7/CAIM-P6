We propose a variational model with diffeomorphic optimal transportation for joint image reconstruction
and motion estimation. The proposed model is a production of assembling the Wasserstein distance
with the Benamou--Brenier formula in optimal transportation and the flow of diffeomorphisms involved
in large deformation diffeomorphic metric mapping, which is suitable for the scenario of spatiotemporal
imaging with large diffeomorphic and mass-preserving deformations. Specifically, we first use
the Benamou--Brenier formula to characterize the optimal transport cost among the flow of mass-preserving
images, and restrict the velocity field into the admissible Hilbert space to guarantee the generated
deformation flow being diffeomorphic. We then gain the ODE-constrained equivalent formulation
for Benamou--Brenier formula. We finally obtain the proposed model with ODE constraint following
the framework that presented in our previous work. We further get the equivalent PDE-constrained
optimal control formulation. The proposed model is compared against several existing alternatives
theoretically. The alternating minimization algorithm is presented for solving the time-discretized
version of the proposed model with ODE constraint. Several important issues on the proposed model
and associated algorithms are also discussed. Particularly, we present several potential models
based on the proposed diffeomorphic optimal transportation. Under appropriate conditions, the
proposed algorithm also provides a new scheme to solve the models using quadratic Wasserstein distance.
The performance is finally evaluated by several numerical experiments in space-time tomography,
where the data is measured from the concerned sequential images with sparse views and/or various
noise levels.

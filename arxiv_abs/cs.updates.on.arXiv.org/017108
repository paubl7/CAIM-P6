Predicting drug-target interactions (DTI) via reliable computational methods is an effective
and efficient way to mitigate the enormous costs and time of the drug discovery process. Structure-based
drug similarities and sequence-based target protein similarities are the commonly used information
for DTI prediction. Among numerous computational methods, neighborhood-based chemogenomic
approaches that leverage drug and target similarities to perform predictions directly are simple
but promising ones. However, existing similarity-based methods need to be re-trained to predict
interactions for any new drugs or targets and cannot directly perform predictions for both new drugs,
new targets, and new drug-target pairs. Furthermore, a large amount of missing (undetected) interactions
in current DTI datasets hinders most DTI prediction methods. To address these issues, we propose
a new method denoted as Weighted k-Nearest Neighbor with Interaction Recovery (WkNNIR). Not only
can WkNNIR estimate interactions of any new drugs and/or new targets without any need of re-training,
but it can also recover missing interactions (false negatives). In addition, WkNNIR exploits local
imbalance to promote the influence of more reliable similarities on the interaction recovery and
prediction processes. We also propose a series of ensemble methods that employ diverse sampling
strategies and could be coupled with WkNNIR as well as any other DTI prediction method to improve
performance. Experimental results over five benchmark datasets demonstrate the effectiveness
of our approaches in predicting drug-target interactions. Lastly, we confirm the practical prediction
ability of proposed methods to discover reliable interactions that were not reported in the original
benchmark datasets.

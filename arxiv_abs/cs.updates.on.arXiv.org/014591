Many animals live in societies where individuals frequently interact socially with each other.
The social structures of these systems can be studied in depth by means of network analysis. A large
number of studies on animal social networks in many species have in recent years been carried out
in the biological research field of animal behaviour and have provided new insights into behaviour,
ecology, and social evolution. This line of research is currently not so well connected to the field
of complex systems as could be expected. The purpose of this paper is to provide an introduction to
animal social networks for complex systems scientists and highlight areas of synergy. We believe
that an increased integration of animal social networks with the interdisciplinary field of complex
systems and networks would be beneficial for various reasons. Increased collaboration between
researchers in this field and biologists studying animal social systems could be valuable in solving
challenges that are of importance to animal social network research. Furthermore, animal social
networks provide the opportunity to investigate hypotheses about complex systems across a range
of natural real-world social systems. In this paper, we describe what animal social networks are
and main research themes where they are studied; we give an overview of the methods commonly used
to study animal social networks; we highlight challenges in the study of animal social networks
where complex systems expertise may be particularly valuable; and we consider aspects of animal
social networks that may be of particular interest to complex systems researchers. We hope that
this will help to facilitate further interdisciplinary collaborations involving animal social
networks, and further integration of these networks into the field of complex systems.

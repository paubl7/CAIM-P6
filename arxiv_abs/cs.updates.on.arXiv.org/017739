Unobserved confounding is a fundamental obstacle to establishing valid causal conclusions from
observational data. Two complementary types of approaches have been developed to address this
obstacle. An extensive line of work is based on taking advantage of fortuitous external aids (such
as the presence of an instrumental variable or other proxy), along with additional assumptions
to ensure identification. A recent line of work of proximal causal inference (Miao et al., 2018a)
has aimed to provide a novel approach to using proxies to deal with unobserved confounding without
relying on stringent parametric assumptions. On the other hand, a complete characterization of
identifiability of a large class of causal parameters in arbitrary causal models with hidden variables
has been developed using the language of graphical models, resulting in the ID algorithm and related
extensions (Tian and Pearl, 2002; Shpitser and Pearl, 2006a,b). Celebrated special cases of this
approach, such as the front-door model, are able to obtain non-parametric identification in seemingly
counter-intuitive situations when a treatment and an outcome share an arbitrarily complicated
unobserved common cause. In this paper we aim to develop a synthesis of the proximal and graphical
approaches to identification in causal inference to yield the most general identification algorithm
in multi- variate systems currently known - the proximal ID algorithm. In addition to being able
to obtain non-parametric identification in all cases where the ID algorithm succeeds, our approach
allows us to systematically exploit proxies to adjust for the presence of unobserved confounders
that would have otherwise prevented identification. In addition, we outline a class of estimation
strategies for causal parameters identified by our method in an important special case. We illustration
our approach by simulation studies.

Human vision is often adversely affected by complex environmental factors, especially in night
vision scenarios. Thus, infrared cameras are often leveraged to help enhance the visual effects
via detecting infrared radiation in the surrounding environment, but the infrared videos are undesirable
due to the lack of detailed semantic information. In such a case, an effective video-to-video translation
method from the infrared domain to the visible light counterpart is strongly needed by overcoming
the intrinsic huge gap between infrared and visible fields. To address this challenging problem,
we propose an infrared-to-visible (I2V) video translation method I2V-GAN to generate fine-grained
and spatial-temporal consistent visible light videos by given unpaired infrared videos. Technically,
our model capitalizes on three types of constraints: 1)adversarial constraint to generate synthetic
frames that are similar to the real ones, 2)cyclic consistency with the introduced perceptual loss
for effective content conversion as well as style preservation, and 3)similarity constraints
across and within domains to enhance the content and motion consistency in both spatial and temporal
spaces at a fine-grained level. Furthermore, the current public available infrared and visible
light datasets are mainly used for object detection or tracking, and some are composed of discontinuous
images which are not suitable for video tasks. Thus, we provide a new dataset for I2V video translation,
which is named IRVI. Specifically, it has 12 consecutive video clips of vehicle and monitoring scenes,
and both infrared and visible light videos could be apart into 24352 frames. Comprehensive experiments
validate that I2V-GAN is superior to the compared SOTA methods in the translation of I2V videos with
higher fluency and finer semantic details. The code and IRVI dataset are available at https://github.com/BIT-DA/I2V-GAN.

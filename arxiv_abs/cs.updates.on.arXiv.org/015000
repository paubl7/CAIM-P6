Quality-of-Service prediction of web service is an integral part of services computing due to its
diverse applications in the various facets of a service life cycle, such as service composition,
service selection, service recommendation. One of the primary objectives of designing a QoS prediction
algorithm is to achieve satisfactory prediction accuracy. However, accuracy is not the only criteria
to meet while developing a QoS prediction algorithm. The algorithm has to be faster in terms of prediction
time so that it can be integrated into a real-time recommendation or composition system. The other
important factor to consider while designing the prediction algorithm is scalability to ensure
that the prediction algorithm can tackle large-scale datasets. The existing algorithms on QoS
prediction often compromise on one goal while ensuring the others. In this paper, we propose a semi-offline
QoS prediction model to achieve three important goals simultaneously: higher accuracy, faster
prediction time, scalability. Here, we aim to predict the QoS value of service that varies across
users. Our framework consists of multi-phase prediction algorithms: preprocessing-phase prediction,
online prediction, and prediction using the pre-trained model. In the preprocessing phase, we
first apply multi-level clustering on the dataset to obtain correlated users and services. We then
preprocess the clusters using collaborative filtering to remove the sparsity of the given QoS invocation
log matrix. Finally, we create a two-staged, semi-offline regression model using neural networks
to predict the QoS value of service to be invoked by a user in real-time. Our experimental results
on four publicly available WS-DREAM datasets show the efficiency in terms of accuracy, scalability,
fast responsiveness of our framework as compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

Language is a powerful tool if used in the correct manner. It is the major mode of communication, and
using the correct choice of words and styles can serve to have a long-lasting impact. Stylistics
is the study of the use of various language styles in communication to pass a message with a bigger
impact or to communicate indirectly. Stylistic analysis, therefore, is the study of the use of linguistic
styles in texts to determine how a style has been used, what is communicated and how it is communicated.
Honest deception is the use of a choice of words to imply something different from the literal meaning.
A person listening or reading a text where honest deception has been used and with a literal understanding
may completely miss out on the point. This is because the issue of honesty and falsehood arises. However,
it would be better to understand that honest deception is used with the intention of having a lasting
impact rather than to deceive the readers, viewers or listeners. The major styles used in honest
deception are hyperboles, litotes, irony and sarcasm. The Seinfeld Sitcom TV series was a situational

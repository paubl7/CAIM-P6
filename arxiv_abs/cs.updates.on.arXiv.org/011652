Advancements in distributed ledger technologies are rapidly driving the rise of decentralized
crowdsourcing systems on top of open smart contract platforms like Ethereum. While decentralized
blockchain-based crowdsourcing provides numerous benefits compared to centralized solutions,
current implementations of decentralized crowdsourcing suffer from fundamental scalability
limitations by requiring all participants to pay a small transaction fee every time they interact
with the blockchain. This increases the cost of using decentralized crowdsourcing solutions,
resulting in a total payment that could be even higher than the price charged by centralized crowdsourcing
platforms. This paper proposes a novel suite of protocols called NF-Crowd that resolves the scalability
issue by reducing the lower bound of the total cost of a decentralized crowdsourcing project to O(1).
NF-Crowd is a highly reliable solution for scaling decentralized crowdsourcing. We prove that
as long as participants of a project powered by NF-Crowd are rational, the O(1) lower bound of cost
could be reached regardless of the scale of the crowd. We also demonstrate that as long as at least
one participant of a project powered by NF-Crowd is honest, the project cannot be aborted and the
results are guaranteed to be correct. We design NF-Crowd protocols for a representative type of
project named crowdsourcing contest with open community review (CC-OCR). We implement the protocols
over the Ethereum official test network. Our results demonstrate that NF-Crowd protocols can reduce
the cost of running a CC-OCR project to less than $2 regardless of the scale of the crowd, providing
a significant cost benefits in adopting decentralized crowdsourcing solutions.

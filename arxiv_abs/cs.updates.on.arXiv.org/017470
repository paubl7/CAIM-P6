More and more observational studies exploit the achievements of mobile technology to ease the overall
implementation procedure. Many strategies like digital phenotyping, ecological momentary assessments
or mobile crowdsensing are used in this context. Recently, an increasing number of intervention
studies makes use of mobile technology as well. For the chronic disorder tinnitus, only few long-running
intervention studies exist, which use mobile technology in a larger setting. Tinnitus is characterized
by its heterogeneous patient's symptom profiles, which complicates the development of general
treatments. In the UNITI project, researchers from different European countries try to unify existing
treatments and interventions to cope with this heterogeneity. One study arm (UNITI Mobile) exploits
mobile technology to investigate newly implemented interventions types, especially within the
pan-European setting. The goals are to learn more about the validity and usefulness of mobile technology
in this context. Furthermore, differences among the countries shall be investigated. Practically,
two native intervention apps have been developed for UNITI and the mobile study arm, which pose features
not presented so far in other apps of the authors. Along the implementation procedure, it is discussed
whether these features might leverage similar types of studies in future. Since instruments like
the mHealth evidence reporting and assessment checklist (mERA), developed by the WHO mHealth technical
evidence review group, indicate that aspects shown for UNITI Mobile are important in the context
of health interventions using mobile phones, our findings may be of a more general interest and are
therefore being discussed in the work at hand.

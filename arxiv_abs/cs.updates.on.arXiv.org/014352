Error-state Kalman filter is an elegant and effective filtering technique for robotic systems
operating on manifolds. To avoid the tedious and repetitive derivations for implementing an error-state
Kalman filter for a certain system, this paper proposes a generic symbolic representation for error-state
Kalman filters on manifolds. Utilizing the $\boxplus\backslash\boxminus$ operations and further
defining a $\oplus$ operation on the respective manifold, we propose a canonical representation
of the robotic system, which enables us to separate the manifold structures from the system descriptions
in each step of the Kalman filter, ultimately leading to a generic, symbolic and manifold-embedding
Kalman filter framework. This proposed Kalman filter framework can be used by only casting the system
model into the canonical form without going through the cumbersome hand-derivation of the on-manifold
Kalman filter. This is particularly useful when the robotic system is of high dimension. Furthermore,
the manifold-embedding Kalman filter is implemented as a toolkit in $C$++, with which an user needs
only to define the system, and call the respective filter steps (e.g., propagation, update) according
to the events (e.g., reception of input, reception of measurement). The existing implementation
supports full iterated Kalman filtering for systems on manifold $\mathcal{S} = \mathbb{R}^m \times
SO(3) \times \cdots \times SO(3) \times \mathbb{S}^2 \times \cdots \times \mathbb{S}^2 $ or any
of its sub-manifolds, and is extendable to other types of manifold when necessary. The proposed
symbolic Kalman filter and the developed toolkit are verified by implementing a tightly-coupled
lidar-inertial navigation system. Results show superior filtering performances and computation
efficiency comparable to hand-engineered counterparts. Finally, the toolkit is opened sourced

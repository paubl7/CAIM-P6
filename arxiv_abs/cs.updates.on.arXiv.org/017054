Coastal water quality management is a public health concern, as poor coastal water quality can harbor
pathogens that are dangerous to human health. Tourism-oriented countries need to actively monitor
the condition of coastal water at tourist popular sites during the summer season. In this study,
routine monitoring data of $Escherichia\ Coli$ and enterococci across 15 public beaches in the
city of Rijeka, Croatia, were used to build machine learning models for predicting their levels
based on environmental parameters as well as to investigate their relationships with environmental
stressors. Gradient Boosting (Catboost, Xgboost), Random Forests, Support Vector Regression
and Artificial Neural Networks were trained with measurements from all sampling sites and used
to predict $E.\ Coli$ and enterococci values based on environmental features. The evaluation of
stability and generalizability with 10-fold cross validation analysis of the machine learning
models, showed that the Catboost algorithm performed best with R$^2$ values of 0.71 and 0.68 for
predicting $E.\ Coli$ and enterococci, respectively, compared to other evaluated ML algorithms
including Xgboost, Random Forests, Support Vector Regression and Artificial Neural Networks.
We also use the SHapley Additive exPlanations technique to identify and interpret which features
have the most predictive power. The results show that site salinity measured is the most important
feature for forecasting both $E.\ Coli$ and enterococci levels. Finally, the spatial and temporal
accuracy of both ML models were examined at sites with the lowest coastal water quality. The spatial
$E. Coli$ and enterococci models achieved strong R$^2$ values of 0.85 and 0.83, while the temporal
models achieved R$^2$ values of 0.74 and 0.67. The temporal model also achieved moderate R$^2$ values
of 0.44 and 0.46 at a site with high coastal water quality.

Modeling human mobility has a wide range of applications from urban planning to simulations of disease
spread. It is well known that humans spend 80% of their time indoors but modeling indoor human mobility
is challenging due to three main reasons: (i) the absence of easily acquirable, reliable, low-cost
indoor mobility datasets, (ii) high prediction space in modeling the frequent indoor mobility,
and (iii) multi-scalar periodicity and correlations in mobility. To deal with all these challenges,
we propose WiFiMod, a Transformer-based, data-driven approach that models indoor human mobility
at multiple spatial scales using WiFi system logs. WiFiMod takes as input enterprise WiFi system
logs to extract human mobility trajectories from smartphone digital traces. Next, for each extracted
trajectory, we identify the mobility features at multiple spatial scales, macro, and micro, to
design a multi-modal embedding Transformer that predicts user mobility for several hours to an
entire day across multiple spatial granularities. Multi-modal embedding captures the mobility
periodicity and correlations across various scales while Transformers capture long-term mobility
dependencies boosting model prediction performance. This approach significantly reduces the
prediction space by first predicting macro mobility, then modeling indoor scale mobility, micro-mobility,
conditioned on the estimated macro mobility distribution, thereby using the topological constraint
of the macro-scale. Experimental results show that WiFiMod achieves a prediction accuracy of at
least 10% points higher than the current state-of-art models. Additionally, we present 3 real-world
applications of WiFiMod - (i) predict high-density hot pockets for policy-making decisions for
COVID19 or ILI, (ii) generate a realistic simulation of indoor mobility, (iii) design personal
assistants.

A novel class of implicit Milstein type methods is devised and analyzed in the present work for stochastic
differential equations (SDEs) with non-globally Lipschitz drift and diffusion coefficients.
By incorporating a pair of method parameters $\theta, \eta \in [0, 1]$ into both the drift and diffusion
parts, the new schemes can be viewed as a kind of double implicit methods, which also work for non-commutative
noise driven SDEs. Within a general framework, we offer upper mean-square error bounds for the proposed
schemes, based on certain error terms only getting involved with the exact solution processes.
Such error bounds help us to easily analyze mean-square convergence rates of the schemes, without
relying on a priori high-order moment estimates of numerical approximations. Putting further
globally polynomial growth condition, we successfully recover the expected mean-square convergence
rate of order one for the considered schemes with $\theta \in [\tfrac12, 1]$, solving general SDEs
in various circumstances. As applications, some of the proposed schemes are also applied to solve
two scalar SDE models arising in mathematical finance and evolving in the positive domain $(0, \infty)$.
More specifically, the particular drift-diffusion implicit Milstein method ($ \theta = \eta =
1 $) is utilized to approximate the Heston $\tfrac32$-volatility model and the semi-implicit Milstein
method ($\theta =1, \eta = 0$) is used to solve the Ait-Sahalia interest rate model. With the aid of
the previously obtained error bounds, we reveal a mean-square convergence rate of order one of the
positivity preserving schemes for the first time under more relaxed conditions, compared with
existing relevant results for first order schemes in the literature. Numerical examples are finally
reported to confirm the previous findings.

Non-invasive radiological-based lesion characterization and identification, e.g., to differentiate
cancer subtypes, has long been a major aim to enhance oncological diagnosis and treatment procedures.
Here we study a specific population of human subjects, with the hope of reducing the need for invasive
surgical biopsies of liver cancer patients, which can cause many harmful side-effects. To this
end, we propose a fully-automated and multi-stage liver tumor characterization framework designed
for dynamic contrast computed tomography (CT). Our system comprises four sequential processes
of tumor proposal detection, tumor harvesting, primary tumor site selection, and deep texture-based
tumor characterization. Our main contributions are that, (1) we propose a 3D non-isotropic anchor-free
detection method for liver lesions; (2) we present and validate spatially adaptivedeep texture
(SaDT) learning, which allows for more precise characterization of liver lesions; (3) using a semi-automatic
process, we bootstrap off of 200 gold standard annotations to curate another 1001 patients. Experimental
evaluations demonstrate that our new data curation strategy, combined with the SaDT deep dynamic
texture analysis, can effectively improve the mean F1 scores by >8.6% compared with baselines,
in differentiating four major liver lesion types. Our F1 score of (hepatocellular carcinoma versus
remaining subclasses) is 0.763, which is higher than reported human observer performance using
dynamic CT and comparable to an advanced magnetic resonance imagery protocol. Apart from demonstrating
the benefits of our data curation approach and physician-inspired workflow, these results also
indicate that analyzing texture features, instead of standard object-based analysis, is a promising
strategy for lesion differentiation.

To interpret information visualizations, observers must determine how visual features map onto
concepts. First and foremost, this ability depends on perceptual discriminability; e.g., observers
must be able to see the difference between different colors for those colors to communicate different
meanings. However, the ability to interpret visualizations also depends on semantic discriminability,
the degree to which observers can infer a unique mapping between visual features and concepts, based
on the visual features and concepts alone (i.e., without help from verbal cues such as legends or
labels). Previous evidence suggested that observers were better at interpreting encoding systems
that maximized semantic discriminability (maximizing association strength between assigned
colors and concepts while minimizing association strength between unassigned colors and concepts),
compared to a system that only maximized color-concept association strength. However, increasing
semantic discriminability also resulted in increased perceptual distance, so it is unclear which
factor was responsible for improved performance. In the present study, we conducted two experiments
that tested for independent effects of semantic distance and perceptual distance on semantic discriminability
of bar graph data visualizations. Perceptual distance was large enough to ensure colors were more
than just noticeably different. We found that increasing semantic distance improved performance,
independent of variation in perceptual distance, and when these two factors were uncorrelated,
responses were dominated by semantic distance. These results have implications for navigating
trade-offs in color palette design optimization for visual communication.

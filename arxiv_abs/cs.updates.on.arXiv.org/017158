Machine Learning algorithms often prompt individuals to strategically modify their observable
attributes to receive more favorable predictions. As a result, the distribution the predictive
model is trained on may differ from the one it operates on in deployment. While such distribution
shifts, in general, hinder accurate predictions, our work identifies a unique opportunity associated
with shifts due to strategic responses: We show that we can use strategic responses effectively
to recover causal relationships between the observable features and outcomes we wish to predict.
More specifically, we study a game-theoretic model in which a principal deploys a sequence of models
to predict an outcome of interest (e.g., college GPA) for a sequence of strategic agents (e.g., college
applicants). In response, strategic agents invest efforts and modify their features for better
predictions. In such settings, unobserved confounding variables can influence both an agent's
observable features (e.g., high school records) and outcomes. Therefore, standard regression
methods generally produce biased estimators. In order to address this issue, our work establishes
a novel connection between strategic responses to machine learning models and instrumental variable
(IV) regression, by observing that the sequence of deployed models can be viewed as an instrument
that affects agents' observable features but does not directly influence their outcomes. Therefore,
two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression can recover the causal relationships between observable
features and outcomes. Beyond causal recovery, we can build on our 2SLS method to address two additional
relevant optimization objectives: agent outcome maximization and predictive risk minimization.
Finally, our numerical simulations on semi-synthetic data show that our methods significantly
outperform OLS regression in causal relationship estimation.

Wine counterfeiting has been posing significant challenges to wine industry, and has undermined
the international wine trading market and the global economy hugely. The situation of counterfeiting
has even been exacerbating in wine industry and global supply chain. There has been a number of anti-counterfeiting
approaches which have been proposed and adopted utilizing different authentication technologies,
in response to growing threats of counterfeiting to wine industry. The proposed NFC-Enabled Anti-Counterfeiting
System (NAS) is developed for luxury-good industry such as wine industry, aiming at upholding provenance
and authenticity of wine products from counterfeits via the product pedigree, transaction records
and supply chain integrity maintained along the supply chain. Consumers can therefore safeguard
their stake by authenticating a specific wine product with their NFC-enabled smartphones before
purchasing at the retail points. NAS utilizes Near-field Communication (NFC), which has emerged
as a promising technology and communication protocol for developing innovative alternatives,
to facilitate the wine record processing of wine products and in turn combat wine and spirit counterfeiting.
The integrated NAS is consisted of a wide range of hardware and software components, and the best
combination of settings, parameters and deployments will therefore be identified. Other possible
implementation issues, such as tag selection, tag programming and encryption, setup of back-end
database servers and the design of NFC mobile application will also be discussed in this project.
The critical design of NAS is vital not only to the key of product anti-counterfeiting of wine industry,
but also to the strong foundation for other innovative supply chain solutions, such as the NFC-enabled
purchasing system, developed on top of NAS with improved and integrated anti-counterfeiting functionalities.

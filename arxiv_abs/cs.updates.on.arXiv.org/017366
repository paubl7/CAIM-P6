We propose and analyze computationally a new fictitious domain method, based on higher order space-time
finite element discretizations, for the simulation of the nonstationary, incompressible Navier-Stokes
equations on evolving domains. The physical domain is embedded into a fixed computational mesh
such that arbitrary intersections of the moving domain's boundaries with the background mesh occur.
The potential of such cut finite element techniques for higher order space-time finite element
methods has rarely been studied in the literature so far and deserves further elucidation. The key
ingredients of the approach are the weak formulation of Dirichlet boundary conditions by Nitsche's
method, the flexible and efficient integration over all types of intersections of cells by moving
boundaries and the spatial extension of the discrete physical quantities to the entire computational
background mesh including fictitious (ghost) subdomains of fluid flow. Thereby, an expensive
remeshing and adaptation of the sparse matrix data structure are avoided and the computations are
accelerated. To prevent spurious oscillations caused by irregular intersections of mesh cells,
a penalization, defining also implicitly the extension to ghost domains, is added. These techniques
are embedded in an arbitrary order, discontinuous Galerkin discretization of the time variable
and an inf-sup stable discretization of the spatial variables. The parallel implementation of
the matrix assembly is described. The optimal order convergence properties of the algorithm are
illustrated in a numerical experiment for an evolving domain. The well-known 2d benchmark of flow
around a cylinder as well as flow around moving obstacles with arising cut cells and fictitious domains
are considered further.

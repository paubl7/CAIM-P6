In spite that Federated Learning (FL) is well known for its privacy protection when training machine
learning models among distributed clients collaboratively, recent studies have pointed out that
the naive FL is susceptible to gradient leakage attacks. In the meanwhile, Differential Privacy
(DP) emerges as a promising countermeasure to defend against gradient leakage attacks. However,
the adoption of DP by clients in FL may significantly jeopardize the model accuracy. It is still an
open problem to understand the practicality of DP from a theoretic perspective. In this paper, we
make the first attempt to understand the practicality of DP in FL through tuning the number of conducted
iterations. Based on the FedAvg algorithm, we formally derive the convergence rate with DP noises
in FL. Then, we theoretically derive: 1) the conditions for the DP based FedAvg to converge as the
number of global iterations (GI) approaches infinity; 2) the method to set the number of local iterations
(LI) to minimize the negative influence of DP noises. By further substituting the Laplace and Gaussian
mechanisms into the derived convergence rate respectively, we show that: 3) The DP based FedAvg
with the Laplace mechanism cannot converge, but the divergence rate can be effectively prohibited
by setting the number of LIs with our method; 4) The learning error of the DP based FedAvg with the Gaussian
mechanism can converge to a constant number finally if we use a fixed number of LIs per GI. To verify
our theoretical findings, we conduct extensive experiments using two real-world datasets. The
results not only validate our analysis results, but also provide useful guidelines on how to optimize
model accuracy when incorporating DP into FL

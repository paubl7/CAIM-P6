Efficiently finding an occluded object with lateral access arises in many contexts such as warehouses,
retail, healthcare, shipping, and homes. We introduce LAX-RAY (Lateral Access maXimal Reduction
of occupancY support Area), a system to automate the mechanical search for occluded objects on shelves.
For such lateral access environments, LAX-RAY couples a perception pipeline predicting a target
object occupancy support distribution with a mechanical search policy that sequentially selects
occluding objects to push to the side to reveal the target as efficiently as possible. Within the
context of extruded polygonal objects and a stationary target with a known aspect ratio, we explore
three lateral access search policies: Distribution Area Reduction (DAR), Distribution Entropy
Reduction (DER), and Distribution Entropy Reduction over Multiple Time Steps (DER-MT) utilizing
the support distribution and prior information. We evaluate these policies using the First-Order
Shelf Simulator (FOSS) in which we simulate 800 random shelf environments of varying difficulty,
and in a physical shelf environment with a Fetch robot and an embedded PrimeSense RGBD Camera. Average
simulation results of 87.3% success rate demonstrate better performance of DER-MT with 2 prediction
steps. When deployed on the robot, results show a success rate of at least 80% for all policies, suggesting
that LAX-RAY can efficiently reveal the target object in reality. Both results show significantly
better performance of the three proposed policies compared to a baseline policy with uniform probability
distribution assumption in non-trivial cases, showing the importance of distribution prediction.

The state of the art in video super-resolution (SR) are techniques based on deep learning, but they
perform poorly on real-world videos (see Figure 1). The reason is that training image-pairs are
commonly created by downscaling a high-resolution image to produce a low-resolution counterpart.
Deep models are therefore trained to undo downscaling and do not generalize to super-resolving
real-world images. Several recent publications present techniques for improving the generalization
of learning-based SR, but are all ill-suited for real-time application. We present a novel approach
to synthesizing training data by simulating two digital-camera image-capture processes at different
scales. Our method produces image-pairs in which both images have properties of natural images.
Training an SR model using this data leads to far better generalization to real-world images and
videos. In addition, deep video-SR models are characterized by a high operations-per-pixel count,
which prohibits their application in real-time. We present an efficient CNN architecture, which
enables real-time application of video SR on low-power edge-devices. We split the SR task into two
sub-tasks: a control-flow which estimates global properties of the input video and adapts the weights
and biases of a processing-CNN that performs the actual processing. Since the process-CNN is tailored
to the statistics of the input, its capacity kept low, while retaining effectivity. Also, since
video-statistics evolve slowly, the control-flow operates at a much lower rate than the video frame-rate.
This reduces the overall computational load by as much as two orders of magnitude. This framework
of decoupling the adaptivity of the algorithm from the pixel processing, can be applied in a large
family of real-time video enhancement applications, e.g., video denoising, local tone-mapping,
stabilization, etc.

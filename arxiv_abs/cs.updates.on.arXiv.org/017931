Anomalies represent rare observations (e.g., data records or events) that deviate significantly
from others. Over several decades, the burst of information has attracted more attention on anomalies
because of their significance in a wide range of disciplines Anomaly detection, which aims to identify
rare observations, is among the most vital tasks in the world, and has shown its power in preventing
detrimental events, such as financial fraud, network intrusion, and social spam. The detection
task is typically solved by identifying outlying data points in the feature space and inherently
overlooks the relational information in real-world data. Graphs have been prevalently used to
represent the structural information, which raises the graph anomaly detection problem - identifying
anomalous graph objects (i.e., nodes, edges and sub-graphs) in a single graph, or anomalous graphs
in a database/set of graphs. However, conventional anomaly detection techniques cannot tackle
this problem well because of the complexity of graph data. For the advent of deep learning, graph
anomaly detection with deep learning has received a growing attention recently. In this survey,
we aim to provide a systematic and comprehensive review of the contemporary deep learning techniques
for graph anomaly detection. We compile open-sourced implementations, public datasets, and commonly-used
evaluation metrics to provide affluent resources for future studies. More importantly, we highlight
twelve extensive future research directions according to our survey results covering unsolved
and emerging research problems and real-world applications. With this survey, our goal is to create
a "one-stop-shop" that provides a unified understanding of the problem categories and existing
approaches, publicly available hands-on resources, and high-impact open challenges for graph
anomaly detection using deep learning.

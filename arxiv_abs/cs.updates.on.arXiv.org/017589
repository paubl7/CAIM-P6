Quantum computing offers the potential of exponential speedups for certain classical computations.
Over the last decade, many quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms have been proposed as candidates
for such exponential improvements. However, two issues unravel the hope of exponential speedup
for some of these QML algorithms: the data-loading problem and, more recently, the stunning dequantization
results of Tang et al. A third issue, namely the fault-tolerance requirements of most QML algorithms,
has further hindered their practical realization. The quantum topological data analysis (QTDA)
algorithm of Lloyd, Garnerone and Zanardi was one of the first QML algorithms that convincingly
offered an expected exponential speedup. From the outset, it did not suffer from the data-loading
problem. A recent result has also shown that the generalized problem solved by this algorithm is
likely classically intractable, and would therefore be immune to any dequantization efforts.
However, the QTDA algorithm of Lloyd et~al. has a time complexity of $O(n^4/(\epsilon^2 \delta))$
(where $n$ is the number of data points, $\epsilon$ is the error tolerance, and $\delta$ is the smallest
nonzero eigenvalue of the restricted Laplacian) and requires fault-tolerant quantum computing,
which has not yet been achieved. In this paper, we completely overhaul the QTDA algorithm to achieve
an improved exponential speedup and depth complexity of $O(n\log(1/(\delta\epsilon)))$. Our
approach includes three key innovations: (a) an efficient realization of the combinatorial Laplacian
as a sum of Pauli operators; (b) a quantum rejection sampling approach to restrict the superposition
to the simplices in the complex; and (c) a stochastic rank estimation method to estimate the Betti
numbers. We present a theoretical error analysis, and the circuit and computational time and depth
complexities for Betti number estimation.

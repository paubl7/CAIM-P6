Electromyography (EMG) refers to a biomedical signal indicating neuromuscular activity and muscle
morphology. Experts accurately diagnose neuromuscular disorders using this time series. Modern
data analysis techniques have recently led to introducing novel approaches for mapping time series
data to graphs and complex networks with applications in diverse fields, including medicine. The
resulting networks develop a completely different visual acuity that can be used to complement
physician findings of time series. This can lead to a more enriched analysis, reduced error, more
accurate diagnosis of the disease, and increased accuracy and speed of the treatment process. The
mapping process may cause the loss of essential data from the time series and not retain all the time
series features. As a result, achieving an approach that can provide a good representation of the
time series while maintaining essential features is crucial. This paper proposes a new approach
to network development named GraphTS to overcome the limited accuracy of existing methods through
EMG time series using the visibility graph method. For this purpose, EMG signals are pre-processed
and mapped to a complex network by a standard visibility graph algorithm. The resulting networks
can differentiate between healthy and patient samples. In the next step, the properties of the developed
networks are given in the form of a feature matrix as input to classifiers after extracting optimal
features. Performance evaluation of the proposed approach with deep neural network shows 99.30%
accuracy for training data and 99.18% for test data. Therefore, in addition to enriched network
representation and covering the features of time series for healthy, myopathy, and neuropathy
EMG, the proposed technique improves accuracy, precision, recall, and F-score.

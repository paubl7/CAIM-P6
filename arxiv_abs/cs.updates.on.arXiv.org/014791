The use of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can advance the Agricultural Business
sector, particularly in a country seeking opportunities to explore the sector. There is evidence
that ICT has made significant contributions to agribusiness because it allows enterprises to manage
their operations, and it has major impacts on the business. However, the critical factors that motivate
the adoption of new innovative technology by agribusiness enterprises are underexplored. The
literature has indicated ICT adoption among small-scale agribusiness enterprises in Somalia
is not fully understood. Nevertheless, this study addresses this gap by investigating the adoption
of ICT among small-scale agribusiness enterprises in Somalia. The paper reports the use of the Technology,
Organization, Environment (TOE) framework. An online survey has been conducted with random sampling
for data collection, with 107 respondents. The respondents are from agribusiness staff and farmers
from various agricultural companies in Somalia. After quantitative data analysis, the results
indicated that relative advantage, complexity, top management support, and competitive pressure
factors are significant contributors to ICT adoption in Somalian agribusiness enterprises, while
ICT costs and vendor support are not significantly related to the adoption of ICT in agricultural
business. This study concludes that ICT adoption in Somalia is inspired by insight and motivation
rather than financial and external support. Understanding these factors leads to a better understanding
of ICT adoption in Somalia. Additionally, it enriches the literature about the agriculture business

Context: In seeking to better understand the impact of various human factors in software development,
and how teams' attitudes relate to their performance, increasing attention is being given to the
study of team-related artefacts. In particular, researchers have conducted numerous studies
on a range of team communication channels to explore links between developers' language use and
the incidence of software bugs in the products they delivered. Comparatively limited attention
has been paid, however, to the full range of software tasks that are commonly performed during the
development and delivery of software systems, in spite of compelling evidence pointing to the need
to understand teams' attitudes more widely. Objective: We were therefore motivated to study the
relationships between task type and team attitudes, and how attitudes expressed in teams' communications
might be related to their task completion performance when undertaking a range of activities. Method:
Our investigation involved artefacts from 474 IBM Jazz practitioners assembled in 149 teams working
on around 30,000 software development tasks over a three-year period. We applied linguistic analysis,
standard statistical techniques and directed content analysis to address our research objective.
Results: Our evidence revealed that teams expressed different attitudes when working on various
forms of software tasks, and they were particularly emotional when working to remedy defects. That
said, teams' expression of attitudes was not found to be a strong predictor of their task completion
performance. Conclusion: Efforts aimed at reducing bug incidence may positively limit teams'
emotional disposition when resolving bugs, thereby reducing the otherwise high demand for emotionally
stable members. (Abridged)

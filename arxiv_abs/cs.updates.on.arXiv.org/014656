Promise Constraint Satisfaction Problems (PCSPs) are a generalization of Constraint Satisfaction
Problems (CSPs) where each predicate has a strong and a weak form and given a CSP instance, the objective
is to distinguish if the strong form can be satisfied vs. even the weak form cannot be satisfied. Since
their formal introduction by Austrin, Guruswami, and H\aa stad, there has been a flurry of works
on PCSPs [BBKO19,KO19,WZ20]. The key tool in studying PCSPs is the algebraic framework developed
in the context of CSPs where the closure properties of the satisfying solutions known as the polymorphisms
are analyzed. The polymorphisms of PCSPs are much richer than CSPs. In the Boolean case, we still
do not know if dichotomy for PCSPs exists analogous to Schaefer's dichotomy result for CSPs. In this
paper, we study a special case of Boolean PCSPs, namely Boolean Ordered PCSPs where the Boolean PCSPs
have the predicate $x \leq y$. In the algebraic framework, this is the special case of Boolean PCSPs
when the polymorphisms are monotone functions. We prove that Boolean Ordered PCSPs exhibit a computational
dichotomy assuming the Rich 2-to-1 Conjecture [BKM21] which is a perfect completeness surrogate
of the Unique Games Conjecture. Assuming the Rich 2-to-1 Conjecture, we prove that a Boolean Ordered
PCSP can be solved in polynomial time if for every $\epsilon>0$, it has polymorphisms where each
coordinate has Shapley value at most $\epsilon$, else it is NP-hard. The algorithmic part of our
dichotomy is based on a structural lemma that Boolean monotone functions with each coordinate having
low Shapley value have arbitrarily large threshold functions as minors. The hardness part proceeds
by showing that the Shapley value is consistent under a uniformly random 2-to-1 minor. Of independent
interest, we show that the Shapley value can be inconsistent under an adversarial 2-to-1 minor.

Cloud computing is considered as the one of the most dominant paradigm in field of information technology
which offers on demand cost effective services such as Software as a service (SAAS), Infrastructure
as a service (IAAS) and Platform as a service (PAAS).Promising all these services as it is, this cloud
computing paradigm still associates number of challenges such as data security, abuse of cloud
services, malicious insider and cyber-attacks. Among all these security requirements of cloud
computing access control is the one of the fundamental requirement in order to avoid unauthorized
access to a system and organizational assets. Main purpose of this research is to review the existing
methods of cloud access control models and their variants pros and cons and to identify further related
research directions for developing an improved access control model for public cloud data storage.
We have presented detailed access control requirement analysis for cloud computing and have identified
important gaps, which are not fulfilled by conventional access control models. As the outcome of
the study we have come up with an improved access control model with hybrid cryptographic schema
and hybrid cloud architecture and practical implementation of it. We have tested our model for security
implications, performance, functionality and data integrity to prove the validity. We have used
AES and RSA cryptographic algorithms to implement the cryptographic schema and used public and
private cloud to enforce our access control security and reliability.By validating and testing
we have proved that our model can withstand against most of the cyber attacks in real cloud environment.
Hence it has improved capabilities compared with other previous access control models that we have
reviewed through literature.

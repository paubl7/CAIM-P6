Diffractive optical networks unify wave optics and deep learning to all-optically compute a given
machine learning or computational imaging task as the light propagates from the input to the output
plane. Here, we report the design of diffractive optical networks for the classification and reconstruction
of spatially overlapping, phase-encoded objects. When two different phase-only objects spatially
overlap, the individual object functions are perturbed since their phase patterns are summed up.
The retrieval of the underlying phase images from solely the overlapping phase distribution presents
a challenging problem, the solution of which is generally not unique. We show that through a task-specific
training process, passive diffractive networks composed of successive transmissive layers can
all-optically and simultaneously classify two different randomly-selected, spatially overlapping
phase images at the input. After trained with ~550 million unique combinations of phase-encoded
handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset, our blind testing results reveal that the diffractive
network achieves an accuracy of >85.8% for all-optical classification of two overlapping phase
images of new handwritten digits. In addition to all-optical classification of overlapping phase
objects, we also demonstrate the reconstruction of these phase images based on a shallow electronic
neural network that uses the highly compressed output of the diffractive network as its input (with
e.g., ~20-65 times less number of pixels) to rapidly reconstruct both of the phase images, despite
their spatial overlap and related phase ambiguity. The presented phase image classification and
reconstruction framework might find applications in e.g., computational imaging, microscopy
and quantitative phase imaging fields.

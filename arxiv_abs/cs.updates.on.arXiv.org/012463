Time-sensitive parcel deliveries, shipments requested for delivery in a day or less, are an increasingly
important research subject. It is challenging to deal with these deliveries from a carrier perspective
since it entails additional planning constraints, preventing an efficient consolidation of deliveries
which is possible when demand is well known in advance. Furthermore, such time-sensitive deliveries
are requested to a wider spatial scope than retail centers, including homes and offices. Therefore,
an increase in such deliveries is considered to exacerbate negative externalities such as congestion
and emissions. One of the solutions is to leverage spare capacity in passenger transport modes.
This concept is often denominated as cargo-hitching. While there are various possible system designs,
it is crucial that such solution does not deteriorate the quality of service of passenger trips.
This research aims to evaluate the use of Mobility-On-Demand services to perform same-day parcel
deliveries. For this purpose, we use SimMobility, a high-resolution agent-based simulation platform
of passenger and freight flows, applied in Singapore. E-commerce demand carrier data are used to
characterize simulated parcel delivery demand. Operational scenarios that aim to minimize the
adverse effect of fulfilling deliveries with Mobility-On-Demand vehicles on Mobility-On-Demand
passenger flows (fulfillment, wait and travel times) are explored. Results indicate that the Mobility-On-Demand
services have potential to fulfill a considerable amount of parcel deliveries and decrease freight
vehicle traffic and total vehicle-kilometers-travelled without compromising the quality of
Mobility On-Demand for passenger travel.

The private simultaneous messages model is a non-interactive version of the multiparty secure
computation, which has been intensively studied to examine the communication cost of the secure
computation. We consider its quantum counterpart, the private simultaneous quantum messages
(PSQM) model, and examine the advantages of quantum communication and prior entanglement of this
model. In the PSQM model, $k$ parties $P_1,\ldots,P_k$ initially share a common random string (or
entangled states in a stronger setting), and they have private classical inputs $x_1,\ldots, x_k$.
Every $P_i$ generates a quantum message from the private input $x_i$ and the shared random string
(entangled states), and then sends it to the referee $R$. Receiving the messages, $R$ computes $F(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$.
Then, $R$ learns nothing except for $F(x_1,\ldots,x_k)$ as the privacy condition. We obtain the
following results for this PSQM model. (1) We demonstrate that the privacy condition inevitably
increases the communication cost in the two-party PSQM model as well as in the classical case presented
by Applebaum, Holenstein, Mishra, and Shayevitz. In particular, we prove a lower bound $(3-o(1))n$
of the communication complexity in PSQM protocols with a shared random string for random Boolean
functions of $2n$-bit input, which is larger than the trivial upper bound $2n$ of the communication
complexity without the privacy condition. (2) We demonstrate a factor two gap between the communication
complexity of PSQM protocols with shared entangled states and with shared random strings by designing
a multiparty PSQM protocol with shared entangled states for a total function that extends the two-party
equality function. (3) We demonstrate an exponential gap between the communication complexity
of PSQM protocols with shared entangled states and with shared random strings for a two-party partial
function.

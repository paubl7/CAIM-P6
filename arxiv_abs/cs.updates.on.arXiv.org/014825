This paper analyzes the joint assessment of quality, spatial and social presence, empathy, attitude,
and attention in three conditions: (A)visualizing and rating the quality of contents in a Head-Mounted
Display (HMD), (B)visualizing the contents in an HMD,and (C)visualizing the contents in an HMD
where participants can see their hands and take notes. The experiment simulates an immersive communication
where participants attend conversations of different genres and from different acquisition perspectives
in the context of international experiences. Video quality is evaluated with Single-Stimulus
Discrete Quality Evaluation (SSDQE) methodology. Spatial and social presence are evaluated with
questionnaires adapted from the literature. Initial empathy is assessed with Interpersonal Reactivity
Index(IRI) and a questionnaire is designed to evaluate attitude. Attention is evaluated with 3
questions that had pass/fail answers. 54 participants were evenly distributed among A, B, and C
conditions taking into account their international experience backgrounds, obtaining a diverse
sample of participants. The results from the subjective test validate the proposed methodology
in VR communications, showing that video quality experiments can be adapted to conditions imposed
by experiments focused on the evaluation of socioemotional features in terms of contents of long-duration,
actor and observer acquisition perspectives, and genre. In addition, the positive results related
to the sense of presence imply that technology can be relevant in the analyzed use case. The acquisition
perspective greatly influences social presence and all the contents have a positive impact on all
participants on their attitude towards international experiences. The annotated dataset, Student
Experiences Around the World dataset (SEAW-dataset), obtained from the experiment is made publicly
available.

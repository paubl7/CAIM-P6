The Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) paradigm is becoming mainstream in multiple clinical trials
and healthcare procedures. It relies on novel very accurate and compact sensing devices and communication
infrastructures, opening previously unmatched possibilities of implementing data collection
and continuous patient monitoring. Nevertheless, to fully exploit the potential of this technology,
some steps forwards are needed. First, the edge-computing paradigm must be added to the picture.
A certain level of near-sensor processing has to be enabled, to improve the scalability, portability,
reliability, responsiveness of the IoMT nodes. Second, novel, increasingly accurate, data analysis
algorithms, such as those based on artificial intelligence and Deep Learning, must be exploited.
To reach these objectives, designers, programmers of IoMT nodes, have to face challenging optimization
tasks, in order to execute fairly complex computing tasks on low-power wearable and portable processing
systems, with tight power and battery lifetime budgets. In this work, we explore the implementation
of cognitive data analysis algorithm on resource-constrained computing platforms. To minimize
power consumption, we add an adaptivity layer that dynamically manages the hardware and software
configuration of the device to adapt it at runtime to the required operating mode. We have assessed
our approach on a use-case using a convolutional neural network to classify electrocardiogram
(ECG) traces on a low-power microcontroller. Our experimental results show that adapting the node
setup to the workload at runtime can save up to 50% power consumption and a quantized neural network
reaches an accuracy value higher than 98% for arrhythmia disorders detection on MIT-BIH Arrhythmia
dataset.

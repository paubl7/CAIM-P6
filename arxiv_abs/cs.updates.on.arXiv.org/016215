Applying chaos theory for secure digital communications is promising and it is well acknowledged
that in such applications the underlying chaotic systems should be carefully chosen. However,
the requirements imposed on the chaotic systems are usually heuristic, without theoretic guarantee
for the resultant communication scheme. Among all the primitives for secure communications, it
is well-accepted that (pseudo) random numbers are most essential. Taking the well-studied two-dimensional
coupled map lattice (2D CML) as an example, this paper performs a theoretical study towards pseudo-random
number generation with the 2D CML. In so doing, an analytical expression of the Lyapunov exponent
(LE) spectrum of the 2D CML is first derived. Using the LEs, one can configure system parameters to
ensure the 2D CML only exhibits complex dynamic behavior, and then collect pseudo-random numbers
from the system orbits. Moreover, based on the observation that least significant bit distributes
more evenly in the (pseudo) random distribution, an extraction algorithm E is developed with the
property that, when applied to the orbits of the 2D CML, it can squeeze uniform bits. In implementation,
if fixed-point arithmetic is used in binary format with a precision of $z$ bits after the radix point,
E can ensure that the deviation of the squeezed bits is bounded by $2^{-z}$ . Further simulation results
demonstrate that the new method not only guide the 2D CML model to exhibit complex dynamic behavior,
but also generate uniformly distributed independent bits. In particular, the squeezed pseudo
random bits can pass both NIST 800-22 and TestU01 test suites in various settings. This study thereby
provides a theoretical basis for effectively applying the 2D CML to secure communications.

Dynamic networks -- networks that change over time -- can be categorized into two types: offline
dynamic networks, where all states of the network are known, and online dynamic networks, where
only the past states of the network are known. Research on staging animated transitions in dynamic
networks has focused more on offline data, where rendering strategies can take into account past
and future states of the network. Rendering online dynamic networks is a more challenging problem
since it requires a balance between timeliness for monitoring tasks -- so that the animations do
not lag too far behind the events -- and clarity for comprehension tasks -- to minimize simultaneous
changes that may be difficult to follow. To illustrate the challenges placed by these requirements,
we explore three strategies to stage animations for online dynamic networks: time-based, event-based,
and a new hybrid approach that we introduce by combining the advantages of the first two. We illustrate
the advantages and disadvantages of each strategy in representing low- and high-throughput data
and conduct a user study involving monitoring and comprehension of dynamic networks. We also conduct
a follow-up, a think-aloud study combining monitoring and comprehension with experts in dynamic
network visualization. Our findings show that animation staging strategies that emphasize comprehension
do better for participant response times and accuracy. However, the notion of ``comprehension''
is not always clear when it comes to complex changes in highly dynamic networks, requiring some iteration
in staging that the hybrid approach affords. Based on our results, we make recommendations for balancing
event-based and time-based parameters for our hybrid approach.

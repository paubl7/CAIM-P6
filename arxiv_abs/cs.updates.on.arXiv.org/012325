Record linkage is the process of bringing together the same entity from overlapping data sources
while removing duplicates. Huge amounts of data are now being collected by public or private organizations
as well as by researchers and individuals. Linking and analysing relevant information from this
massive data reservoir can provide new insights into society. However, this increase in the amount
of data may also increase the likelihood of incorrectly linked records among databases. It has become
increasingly important to have effective and efficient methods for linking data from different
sources. Therefore, it becomes necessary to assess the ability of a linking method to achieve high
accuracy or to compare between methods with respect to accuracy. In this paper, we improve on a Markov
Chain based Monte Carlo simulation approach (MaCSim) for assessing a linking method. MaCSim utilizes
two linked files that have been previously linked on similar types of data to create an agreement
matrix and then simulates the matrix using a proposed algorithm developed to generate re-sampled
versions of the agreement matrix. A defined linking method is used in each simulation to link the
files and the accuracy of the linking method is assessed. The improvement proposed here involves
calculation of a similarity weight for every linking variable value for each record pair, which
allows partial agreement of the linking variable values. A threshold is calculated for every linking
variable based on adjustable parameter "tolerance" for that variable. To assess the accuracy of
linking method, correctly linked proportions are investigated for each record. The extended MaCSim
approach is illustrated using a synthetic dataset provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics
(ABS) based on realistic data settings. Test results show higher accuracy of the assessment of linkages.

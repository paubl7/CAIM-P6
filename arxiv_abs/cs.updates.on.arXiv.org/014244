This article provides the motivation and overview of the Collective Knowledge framework (CK or
cKnowledge). The CK concept is to decompose research projects into reusable components that encapsulate
research artifacts and provide unified application programming interfaces (APIs), command-line
interfaces (CLIs), meta descriptions and common automation actions for related artifacts. The
CK framework is used to organize and manage research projects as a database of such components. Inspired
by the USB "plug and play" approach for hardware, CK also helps to assemble portable workflows that
can automatically plug in compatible components from different users and vendors (models, datasets,
frameworks, compilers, tools). Such workflows can build and run algorithms on different platforms
and environments in a unified way using the universal CK program pipeline with software detection
plugins and the automatic installation of missing packages. This article presents a number of industrial
projects in which the modular CK approach was successfully validated in order to automate benchmarking,
auto-tuning and co-design of efficient software and hardware for machine learning (ML) and artificial
intelligence (AI) in terms of speed, accuracy, energy, size and various costs. The CK framework
also helped to automate the artifact evaluation process at several computer science conferences
as well as to make it easier to reproduce, compare and reuse research techniques from published papers,
deploy them in production, and automatically adapt them to continuously changing datasets, models
and systems. The long-term goal is to accelerate innovation by connecting researchers and practitioners
to share and reuse all their knowledge, best practices, artifacts, workflows and experimental
results in a common, portable and reproducible format at https://cKnowledge.io .

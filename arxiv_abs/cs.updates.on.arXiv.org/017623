Nowadays, artificial neural networks are widely used for users' online travel planning. Personalized
travel planning has many real applications and is affected by various factors, such as transportation
type, intention destination estimation, budget limit and crowdness prediction. Among those factors,
users' intention destination prediction is an essential task in online travel platforms. The reason
is that, the user may be interested in the travel plan only when the plan matches his real intention
destination. Therefore, in this paper, we focus on predicting users' intention destinations in
online travel platforms. In detail, we act as online travel platforms (such as Fliggy and Airbnb)
to recommend travel plans for users, and the plan consists of various vacation items including hotel
package, scenic packages and so on. Predicting the actual intention destination in travel planning
is challenging. Firstly, users' intention destination is highly related to their travel status
(e.g., planning for a trip or finishing a trip). Secondly, users' actions (e.g. clicking, searching)
over different product types (e.g. train tickets, visa application) have different indications
in destination prediction. Thirdly, users may mostly visit the travel platforms just before public
holidays, and thus user behaviors in online travel platforms are more sparse, low-frequency and
long-period. Therefore, we propose a Deep Multi-Sequences fused neural Networks (DMSN) to predict
intention destinations from fused multi-behavior sequences. Real datasets are used to evaluate
the performance of our proposed DMSN models. Experimental results indicate that the proposed DMSN
models can achieve high intention destination prediction accuracy.

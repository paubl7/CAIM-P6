Machine learning (ML) has demonstrated promising results in the identification of clinical markers
for Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS) from electronic health records (EHR). In the past, the ACS was
perceived as a health problem mainly for men and women were under-represented in clinical trials,
which led to both sexes receiving the same clinical attention. Although some approaches have emphasized
the importance of distinguishing markers, these distinctions remain unclear. This study aims
at exploiting ML methods for identifying in-hospital mortality markers by sex and age-group for
patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and the Non-ST-elevation myocardial
infarction (NSTEMI) from EHR. From the MIMIC-III database, we extracted 1,299 patients with STEMI
and 2,820 patients with NSTEMI. We trained and validated mortality prediction models with different
hyperparameters, clinical sets, and ML methods. Using the best performing model and a game-theoretic
approach to interpret predictions, we identified risk markers for patients with STEMI and NSTEMI
separately. The models based on Extreme Gradient Boosting achieved the highest performance: AUC=0.92
(95\% CI:0.87-0.98) for STEMI and AUC=0.87 (95\% CI:0.80-0.93) for NSTEMI. For STEMI, the top markers
for both sexes are the presence of hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis. More specific markers
for women are acute kidney failure, and age>75 years, while for men are chronic kidney failure, and
age>70 years. In contrast, for NSTEMI, the top markers for both sexes are advanced age, and intubation
procedures. The specific markers for women are low creatinine levels and age>60 years, whilst,
for men are damage to the left atrium and age>70 years. We consider that distinguishing markers for
sexes could lead to more appropriate treatment strategies, thus improving clinical outcomes.

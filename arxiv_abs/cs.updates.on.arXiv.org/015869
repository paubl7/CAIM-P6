It is well-known that GPS is vulnerable to signal spoofing attacks. Although several spoofing detection
techniques exist, they are incapable of mitigation and recovery from stealthy attackers. In this
work, we present SemperFi, a single antenna GPS receiver capable of tracking legitimate GPS satellite
signals and estimating the true location even during a spoofing attack. The main challenge in building
SemperFi is, unlike most wireless systems where \emph{the data} contained in the wireless signals
is important, GPS relies on the time of arrival (ToA) of satellite signals. SemperFi is capable of
distinguishing spoofing signals and recovering legitimate GPS signals that are even completely
overshadowed by a strong adversary. We exploit the short-term stability of inertial sensors to
identify the spoofing signal and extend the successive interference cancellation algorithm to
preserve the legitimate signal's ToA. We implement SemperFi in GNSS-SDR, an open-source software-defined
GNSS receiver, and evaluate its performance using UAV simulators, real drones, a variety of real-world
GPS datasets, and various embedded platforms. Our evaluation results indicate that in many scenarios,
SemperFi can identify adversarial peaks by executing flight patterns that are less than 50 m long
and recover the true location within 10 seconds (Jetson Xavier). We show that our receiver is secure
against stealthy attackers who exploit inertial sensor errors and execute seamless takeover attacks.
We design SemperFi as a pluggable module capable of generating a spoofer-free GPS signal for processing
on any commercial-off-the-shelf GPS receiver available today. Finally, we release our implementation
to the community for usage and further research.

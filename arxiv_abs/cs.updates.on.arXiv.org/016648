Many meta-learning methods are proposed for few-shot detection. However, previous most methods
have two main problems, poor detection APs, and strong bias because of imbalance and insufficient
datasets. Previous works mainly alleviate these issues by additional datasets, multi-relation
attention mechanisms and sub-modules. However, they require more cost. In this work, for meta-learning,
we find that the main challenges focus on related or irrelevant semantic features between categories.
Therefore, based on semantic features, we propose a Top-C classification loss (i.e., TCL-C) for
classification task and a category-based grouping mechanism for category-based meta-features
obtained by the meta-model. The TCL-C exploits the true-label prediction and the most likely C-1
false classification predictions to improve detection performance on few-shot classes. According
to similar appearance (i.e., visual appearance, shape, and limbs etc.) and environment in which
objects often appear, the category-based grouping mechanism splits categories into disjoint
groups to make similar semantic features more compact between categories within a group and obtain
more significant difference between groups, alleviating the strong bias problem and further improving
detection APs. The whole training consists of the base model and the fine-tuning phases. According
to grouping mechanism, we group the meta-features vectors obtained by meta-model, so that the distribution
difference between groups is obvious, and the one within each group is less. Extensive experiments
on Pascal VOC dataset demonstrate that ours which combines the TCL-C with category-based grouping
significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods for few-shot detection. Compared
with previous competitive baseline, ours improves detection APs by almost 4% for few-shot detection.

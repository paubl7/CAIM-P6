Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model has been widely used for prototyping data centers. Evolving
it to high-fidelity {\em digital twin} is desirable for the management and operations of large-scale
data centers. Manually calibrating CFD model parameters to achieve twin-class fidelity by specially
trained domain expert is tedious and labor-intensive. To reduce manual efforts, existing automatic
calibration approaches developed for various computational models apply heuristics to search
model configurations within an empirically defined parameter bound. However, in the context of
CFD, each search step requires long-lasting CFD model's iterated solving, rendering these approaches
impractical with increased model complexity. This paper presents Kalibre, a knowledge-based
neural surrogate approach that performs CFD model calibration by iterating four key steps of i)
training a neural surrogate model based on CFD-generated data, ii) finding the optimal parameters
at the moment through neural surrogate retraining based on sensor-measured data, iii) configuring
the found parameters back to the CFD model, and iv) validating the CFD model using sensor-measured
data as the ground truth. Thus, the parameter search is offloaded to the neural surrogate which is
ultra-faster than CFD model's iterated solving. To speed up the convergence of Kalibre, we integrate
prior knowledge of the twinned data center's thermophysics into the neural surrogate design to
improve its learning efficiency. With about five hours computation on a 32-core processor, Kalibre
achieves mean absolute errors (MAEs) of $0.81^o$C and $0.75^o$C in calibrating two CFD models for
two production data halls hosting thousands of servers each while requires fewer CFD solving processes
than existing baseline approaches.

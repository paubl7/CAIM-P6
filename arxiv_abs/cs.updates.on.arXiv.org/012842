In recent years, edge computing has become a popular choice for latency-sensitive applications
like facial recognition and augmented reality because it is closer to the end users compared to the
cloud. Although infrastructure providers are working toward creating managed edge networks,
personal devices such as laptops and tablets, which are widely available and are underutilized,
can also be used as potential edge devices. We call such devices Unmanaged Edge Devices (UEDs). Scheduling
application tasks on such an unmanaged edge system is not straightforward because of three fundamental
reasons-heterogeneity in the computational capacity of the UEDs, uncertainty in the availability
of the UEDs (due to devices leaving the system), and interference among multiple tasks sharing a
UED. In this paper, we present I-BOT, an interference-based orchestration scheme for latency-sensitive
tasks on an Unmanaged Edge Platform (UEP). It minimizes the completion time of applications and
is bandwidth efficient. I-BOT brings forth three innovations. First, it profiles and predicts
the interference patterns of the tasks to make scheduling decisions. Second, it uses a feedback
mechanism to adjust for changes in the computational capacity of the UEDs and a prediction mechanism
to handle their sporadic exits. Third, it accounts for input dependence of tasks in its scheduling
decision (such as, two tasks requiring the same input data). To evaluate I-BOT, we run end-to-end
simulations with applications representing autonomous driving, composed of multiple tasks.
We compare to two basic baselines (random and round-robin) and two state-of-the-arts, Lavea [SEC-2017]
and Petrel [MSN-2018]. Compared to these baselines, I-BOT significantly reduces the average service
time of application tasks. This reduction is more pronounced in dynamic heterogeneous environments,
which would be the case in a UEP.

The challenge of learning a new concept, object, or a new medical disease recognition without receiving
any examples beforehand is called Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL). One of the major issues in deep learning
based methodologies such as in Medical Imaging and other real-world applications is the requirement
of large annotated datasets prepared by clinicians or experts to train the model. ZSL is known for
having minimal human intervention by relying only on previously known or trained concepts plus
currently existing auxiliary information. This makes the ZSL applicable in many real-world scenarios,
from unknown object detection in autonomous vehicles to medical imaging and unforeseen diseases
such as COVID-19 Chest X-Ray (CXR) based diagnosis. We introduce a novel and broaden solution called
Few/one-shot learning, and present the definition of the ZSL problem as an extreme case of the few-shot
learning. We review over fundamentals and the challenging steps of Zero-Shot Learning, including
state-of-the-art categories of solutions, as well as our recommended solution, motivations behind
each approach, their advantages over each category to guide both clinicians and AI researchers
to proceed with the best techniques and practices based on their applications. We then review through
different datasets inducing medical and non-medical images, the variety of splits, and the evaluation
protocols proposed so far. Finally, we discuss the recent applications and future directions of
ZSL. We aim to convey a useful intuition through this paper towards the goal of handling complex learning
tasks more similar to the way humans learn. We mainly focus on two applications in the current modern
yet challenging era: coping with an early and fast diagnosis of COVID-19 cases, and also encouraging
the readers to develop other similar AI-based automated detection/recognition systems using
ZSL.

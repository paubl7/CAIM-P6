Most of existing outlier detection methods assume that the outlier factors (i.e., outlierness
scoring measures) of data entities (e.g., feature values and data objects) are Independent and
Identically Distributed (IID). This assumption does not hold in real-world applications where
the outlierness of different entities is dependent on each other and/or taken from different probability
distributions (non-IID). This may lead to the failure of detecting important outliers that are
too subtle to be identified without considering the non-IID nature. The issue is even intensified
in more challenging contexts, e.g., high-dimensional data with many noisy features. This work
introduces a novel outlier detection framework and its two instances to identify outliers in categorical
data by capturing non-IID outlier factors. Our approach first defines and incorporates distribution-sensitive
outlier factors and their interdependence into a value-value graph-based representation. It
then models an outlierness propagation process in the value graph to learn the outlierness of feature
values. The learned value outlierness allows for either direct outlier detection or outlying feature
selection. The graph representation and mining approach is employed here to well capture the rich
non-IID characteristics. Our empirical results on 15 real-world data sets with different levels
of data complexities show that (i) the proposed outlier detection methods significantly outperform
five state-of-the-art methods at the 95%/99% confidence level, achieving 10%-28% AUC improvement
on the 10 most complex data sets; and (ii) the proposed feature selection methods significantly
outperform three competing methods in enabling subsequent outlier detection of two different
existing detectors.

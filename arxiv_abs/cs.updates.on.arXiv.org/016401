To mitigate the spread of COVID-19 pandemic, decision-makers and public authorities have announced
various non-pharmaceutical policies. Analyzing the causal impact of these policies in reducing
the spread of COVID-19 is important for future policy-making. The main challenge here is the existence
of unobserved confounders (e.g., vigilance of residents). Besides, as the confounders may be time-varying
during COVID-19 (e.g., vigilance of residents changes in the course of the pandemic), it is even
more difficult to capture them. In this paper, we study the problem of assessing the causal effects
of different COVID-19 related policies on the outbreak dynamics in different counties at any given
time period. To this end, we integrate data about different COVID-19 related policies (treatment)
and outbreak dynamics (outcome) for different United States counties over time and analyze them
with respect to variables that can infer the confounders, including the covariates of different
counties, their relational information and historical information. Based on these data, we develop
a neural network based causal effect estimation framework which leverages above information in
observational data and learns the representations of time-varying (unobserved) confounders.
In this way, it enables us to quantify the causal impact of policies at different granularities,
ranging from a category of policies with a certain goal to a specific policy type in this category.
Besides, experimental results also indicate the effectiveness of our proposed framework in capturing
the confounders for quantifying the causal impact of different policies. More specifically, compared
with several baseline methods, our framework captures the outbreak dynamics more accurately,
and our assessment of policies is more consistent with existing epidemiological studies of COVID-19.

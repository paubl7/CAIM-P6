Modern scientific and technological advances are allowing botanists to use computer vision-based
approaches for plant identification tasks. These approaches have their own challenges. Leaf classification
is a computer-vision task performed for the automated identification of plant species, a serious
challenge due to variations in leaf morphology, including its size, texture, shape, and venation.
Researchers have recently become more inclined toward deep learning-based methods rather than
conventional feature-based methods due to the popularity and successful implementation of deep
learning methods in image analysis, object recognition, and speech recognition. In this paper,
a botanist's behavior was modeled in leaf identification by proposing a highly-efficient method
of maximum behavioral resemblance developed through three deep learning-based models. Different
layers of the three models were visualized to ensure that the botanist's behavior was modeled accurately.
The first and second models were designed from scratch.Regarding the third model, the pre-trained
architecture MobileNetV2 was employed along with the transfer-learning technique. The proposed
method was evaluated on two well-known datasets: Flavia and MalayaKew. According to a comparative
analysis, the suggested approach was more accurate than hand-crafted feature extraction methods
and other deep learning techniques in terms of 99.67% and 99.81% accuracy. Unlike conventional
techniques that have their own specific complexities and depend on datasets, the proposed method
required no hand-crafted feature extraction, and also increased accuracy and distributability
as compared with other deep learning techniques. It was further considerably faster than other
methods because it used shallower networks with fewer parameters and did not use all three models
recurrently.

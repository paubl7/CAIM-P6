Small target motion detection within complex natural environments is an extremely challenging
task for autonomous robots. Surprisingly, the visual systems of insects have evolved to be highly
efficient in detecting mates and tracking prey, even though targets are as small as a few pixels in
their visual fields. The excellent sensitivity to small target motion relies on a class of specialized
neurons called small target motion detectors (STMDs). However, existing STMD-based models are
heavily dependent on visual contrast and perform poorly in complex natural environments where
small targets generally exhibit extremely low contrast against neighbouring backgrounds. In
this paper, we develop an attention and prediction guided visual system to overcome this limitation.
The developed visual system comprises three main subsystems, namely, an attention module, an STMD-based
neural network, and a prediction module. The attention module searches for potential small targets
in the predicted areas of the input image and enhances their contrast against complex background.
The STMD-based neural network receives the contrast-enhanced image and discriminates small moving
targets from background false positives. The prediction module foresees future positions of the
detected targets and generates a prediction map for the attention module. The three subsystems
are connected in a recurrent architecture allowing information to be processed sequentially to
activate specific areas for small target detection. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed visual system for detecting
small, low-contrast moving targets against complex natural environments.

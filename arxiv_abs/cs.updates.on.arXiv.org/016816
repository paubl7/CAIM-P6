Real-time remote sensing applications like search and rescue missions, military target detection,
environmental monitoring, hazard prevention and other time-critical applications require onboard
real time processing capabilities or autonomous decision making. Some unmanned remote systems
like satellites are physically remote from their operators, and all control of the spacecraft and
data returned by the spacecraft must be transmitted over a wireless radio link. This link may not
be available for extended periods when the satellite is out of line of sight of its ground station.
Therefore, lightweight, small size and low power consumption hardware is essential for onboard
real time processing systems. With increasing dimensionality, size and resolution of recent hyperspectral
imaging sensors, additional challenges are posed upon remote sensing processing systems and more
capable computing architectures are needed. Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) emerged as promising
architecture for light weight high performance computing that can address these computational
requirements for onboard systems. The goal of this study is to build high performance methods for
onboard hyperspectral analysis. We propose accelerated methods for the well-known recursive
hierarchical segmentation (RHSEG) clustering method, using GPUs, hybrid multicore CPU with a
GPU and hybrid multi-core CPU/GPU clusters. RHSEG is a method developed by the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration (NASA), which is designed to provide rich classification information
with several output levels. The achieved speedups by parallel solutions compared to CPU sequential
implementations are 21x for parallel single GPU and 240x for hybrid multi-node computer clusters
with 16 computing nodes. The energy consumption is reduced to 74% using a single GPU compared to the
equivalent parallel CPU cluster.

Video streaming platforms such as Youtube, Twitch, and DLive allow users to live-stream video content
for viewers who can optionally express their appreciation through monetary donations. DLive is
one of the smaller and lesser-known streaming platforms, and historically has had fewer content
moderation practices. It has thus become a popular place for violent extremists and other clandestine
groups to earn money and propagandize. What is the financial structure of the DLive streaming ecosystem
and how much money is changing hands? In the past it has been difficult to understand how far-right
extremists fundraise via podcasts and video streams because of the secretive nature of the activity
and because of the difficulty of getting data from social media platforms. This paper describes
a novel experiment to collect and analyze data from DLive's publicly available ledgers of transactions
in order to understand the financial structure of the clandestine, extreme far-right video streaming
community. The main findings of this paper are, first, that the majority of donors are using micropayments
in varying frequencies, but a small handful of donors spend large amounts of money to finance their
favorite streamers. Next, the timing of donations to high-profile far-right streamers follows
a fairly predictable pattern that is closely tied to a broadcast schedule. Finally, the far-right
video streaming financial landscape is divided into separate cliques which exhibit very little
crossover in terms of sizable donations. This work will be important to technology companies, policymakers,
and researchers who are trying to understand how niche social media services, including video platforms,
are being exploited by extremists to propagandize and fundraise.

Accurate characterisation of visual attributes such as spiculation, lobulation, and calcification
of lung nodules is critical in cancer management. The characterisation of these attributes is often
subjective, which may lead to high inter- and intra-observer variability. Furthermore, lung nodules
are often heterogeneous in the cross-sectional image slices of a 3D volume. Current state-of-the-art
methods that score multiple attributes rely on deep learning-based multi-task learning (MTL)
schemes. These methods, however, extract shared visual features across attributes and then examine
each attribute without explicitly leveraging their inherent intercorrelations. Furthermore,
current methods either treat each slice with equal importance without considering their relevance
or heterogeneity, which limits performance. In this study, we address these challenges with a new
convolutional neural network (CNN)-based MTL model that incorporates multiple attention-based
learning modules to simultaneously score 9 visual attributes of lung nodules in computed tomography
(CT) image volumes. Our model processes entire nodule volumes of arbitrary depth and uses a slice
attention module to filter out irrelevant slices. We also introduce cross-attribute and attribute
specialisation attention modules that learn an optimal amalgamation of meaningful representations
to leverage relationships between attributes. We demonstrate that our model outperforms previous
state-of-the-art methods at scoring attributes using the well-known public LIDC-IDRI dataset
of pulmonary nodules from over 1,000 patients. Our model also performs competitively when repurposed
for benign-malignant classification. Our attention modules also provide easy-to-interpret
weights that offer insights into the predictions of the model.

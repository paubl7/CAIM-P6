Sparse code multiple access (SCMA), as a codebook-based non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA)
technique, has received research attention in recent years. The codebook design problem for SCMA
has also been studied to some extent since codebook choices are highly related to the system's error
rate performance. In this paper, we approach the SCMA codebook design problem by formulating an
optimization problem to maximize the minimum Euclidean distance (MED) of superimposed codewords
under power constraints. While SCMA codebooks with a larger MED are expected to obtain a better BER
performance, no optimal SCMA codebook in terms of MED maximization, to the authors' best knowledge,
has been reported in the SCMA literature yet. In this paper, a new iterative algorithm based on alternating
maximization with exact penalty is proposed for the MED maximization problem. The proposed algorithm,
when supplied with appropriate initial points and parameters, achieves a set of codebooks of all
users whose MED is larger than any previously reported results. A Lagrange dual problem is derived
which provides an upper bound of MED of any set of codebooks. Even though there is still a nonzero gap
between the achieved MED and the upper bound given by the dual problem, simulation results demonstrate
clear advantages in error rate performances of the proposed set of codebooks over all existing ones
not only in AWGN channels but also in some downlink scenarios that fit in 5G/NR applications, making
it a good codebook candidate thereof. The proposed set of SCMA codebooks, however, are not shown
to outperform existing ones in uplink channels or in the case where non-consecutive OFDMA subcarriers
are used. The correctness and accuracy of error curves in the simulation results are further confirmed
by the coincidences with the theoretical upper bounds of error rates derived for any given set of
codebooks.

Over three decades ago, Karp, Vazirani and Vazirani (STOC'90) introduced the online bipartite
matching problem. They observed that deterministic algorithms' competitive ratio for this problem
is no greater than $1/2$, and proved that randomized algorithms can do better. A natural question
thus arises: \emph{how random is random}? i.e., how much randomness is needed to outperform deterministic
algorithms? The \textsc{ranking} algorithm of Karp et al.~requires $\tilde{O}(n)$ random bits,
which, ignoring polylog terms, remained unimproved. On the other hand, Pena and Borodin (TCS'19)
established a lower bound of $(1-o(1))\log\log n$ random bits for any $1/2+\Omega(1)$ competitive
ratio. We close this doubly-exponential gap, proving that, surprisingly, the lower bound is tight.
In fact, we prove a \emph{sharp threshold} of $(1\pm o(1))\log\log n$ random bits for the randomness
necessary and sufficient to outperform deterministic algorithms for this problem, as well as its
vertex-weighted generalization. This implies the same threshold for the advice complexity (nondeterminism)
of these problems. Similar to recent breakthroughs in the online matching literature, for edge-weighted
matching (Fahrbach et al.~FOCS'20) and adwords (Huang et al.~FOCS'20), our algorithms break the
barrier of $1/2$ by randomizing matching choices over two neighbors. Unlike these works, our approach
does not rely on the recently-introduced OCS machinery, nor the more established randomized primal-dual
method. Instead, our work revisits a highly-successful online design technique, which was nonetheless
under-utilized in the area of online matching, namely (lossless) online rounding of fractional
algorithms. While this technique is known to be hopeless for online matching in general, we show
that it is nonetheless applicable to carefully designed fractional algorithms with additional
(non-convex) constraints.

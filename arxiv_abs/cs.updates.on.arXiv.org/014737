We are recently witnessing an increased adoption of microservice architectures by the industry
for achieving scalability by functional decomposition, fault-tolerance by deployment of small
and independent services, and polyglot persistence by the adoption of different database technologies
specific to the needs of each service. Despite the accelerating industrial adoption and the extensive
research on microservices, there is a lack of thorough investigation on the state of the practice
and the major challenges faced by practitioners with regard to data management. To bridge this gap,
this paper presents a detailed investigation of data management in microservices. Our exploratory
study is based on the following methodology: we conducted a systematic literature review of articles
reporting the adoption of microservices in industry, where more than 300 articles were filtered
down to 11 representative studies; we analyzed a set of 9 popular open-source microservice-based
applications, selected out of more than 20 open-source projects; furthermore, to strengthen our
evidence, we conducted an online survey that we then used to cross-validate the findings of the previous
steps with the perceptions and experiences of over 120 practitioners and researchers. Through
this process, we were able to categorize the state of practice and reveal several principled challenges
that cannot be solved by software engineering practices, but rather need system-level support
to alleviate the burden of practitioners. Based on the observations we also identified a series
of research directions to achieve this goal. Fundamentally, novel database systems and data management
tools that support isolation for microservices, which include fault isolation, performance isolation,
data ownership, and independent schema evolution across microservices must be built to address
the needs of this growing architectural style.

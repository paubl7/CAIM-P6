Stochastic flows of an advective-diffusive nature are ubiquitous in physical sciences. Of particular
interest is the problem to reconcile observed marginal distributions with a given prior posed by
E. Schrodinger in 1932/32 and known as the Schrodinger Bridge Problem (SBP). Due to its fundamental
significance, interest in SBP has in recent years enticed a broad spectrum of disciplines. Yet,
while the mathematics and applications of SBP have been developing at a considerable pace, accounting
for marginals of unequal mass has received scant attention; the problem to interpolate between
unbalanced marginals has been approached by introducing source/sink terms in an Adhoc manner.
Nevertheless, losses are inherent in many physical processes and, thereby, models that account
for lossy transport may also need to be reconciled with observed marginals following Schrodinger's
dictum; that is, to adjust the probability of trajectories of particles, including those that do
not make it to the terminal observation point, so that the updated law represents the most likely
way that particles may have been transported, or vanished, at some intermediate point. Thus, the
purpose of this work is to develop such a natural generalization of the SBP for stochastic evolution
with losses, whereupon particles are "killed" according to a probabilistic law. Through a suitable
embedding, we turn the problem into an SBP for stochastic processes that combine diffusive and jump
characteristics. Then, following a large-deviations formalism, given a prior law that allows
for losses, we ask for the most probable evolution of particles along with the most likely killing
rate as the particles transition between the specified marginals. Our approach differs sharply
from previous work involving a Feynman-Kac multiplicative reweighing of the reference measure:
The latter, as we argue, is far from Schrodinger's quest.

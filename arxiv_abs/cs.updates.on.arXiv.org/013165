Background: MRI is the modality of choice for cartilage imaging; however, its diagnostic performance
is variable and significantly lower than the gold standard diagnostic knee arthroscopy. In recent
years, deep learning has been used to automatically interpret medical images to improve diagnostic
accuracy and speed. Purpose: The primary purpose of this study was to evaluate whether deep learning
applied to the interpretation of knee MRI images can be utilized to identify cartilage defects accurately.
Methods: We analyzed data from patients who underwent knee MRI evaluation and consequently had
arthroscopic knee surgery (207 with cartilage defect, 90 without cartilage defect). Patients'
arthroscopic findings were compared to preoperative MRI images to verify the presence or absence
of isolated tibiofemoral cartilage defects. We developed three convolutional neural networks
(CNNs) to analyze the MRI images and implemented image-specific saliency maps to visualize the
CNNs' decision-making process. To compare the CNNs' performance against human interpretation,
the same test dataset images were provided to an experienced orthopaedic surgeon and an orthopaedic
resident. Results: Saliency maps demonstrated that the CNNs learned to focus on the clinically
relevant areas of the tibiofemoral articular cartilage on MRI images during the decision-making
processes. One CNN achieved higher performance than the orthopaedic surgeon, with two more accurate
diagnoses made by the CNN. All the CNNs outperformed the orthopaedic resident. Conclusion: CNN
can be used to enhance the diagnostic performance of MRI in identifying isolated tibiofemoral cartilage
defects and may replace diagnostic knee arthroscopy in certain cases in the future.

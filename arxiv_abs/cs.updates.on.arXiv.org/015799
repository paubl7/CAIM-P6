The leakage of security-critical information has become an ever-increasing problem for cryptographic
systems. Profiled side-channel analysis (SCA) leverages this leakage to extract sensitive data
(e.g., the secret key) from cryptographic implementations. When combined with advanced methods
in neural networks (NNs), profiled SCA can successfully attack even those crypto-cores assumed
to be protected against SCA. Nevertheless and despite the rise in the number of studies devoted to
NN-based SCA, a range of questions remain unanswered, namely: how to choose an NN with an adequate
size, how to tune hyperparameters in the NN, when to stop the training, and how to explain the performance
of the NN model in quantitative terms, in the context of SCA. Our proposed approach, "InfoNEAT,"
tackles these issues in a natural way. InfoNEAT relies on the concept of evolution of NNs (both the
network architecture and parameters, so-called nueroevolution), enhanced by incorporating
information-theoretic metrics to guide the evolution, halt it with a novel stopping criteria,
and improve the time-complexity and memory footprint of it. Interestingly enough, our approach
can be employed in various domains, although InfoNEAT, as presented in this paper, is tailored to
the specific requirements of SCA. The performance of InfoNEAT is evaluated by applying that against
publicly available datasets composed of real side-channel measurements. According to our assessment
and on the basis of our results, InfoNEAT achieves the same performance (in terms of key recovery)
as the state-of-the-art NN-based SCA. In addition to the considerable advantages regarding the
automated configuration of NNs, InfoNEAT also demonstrates significant improvements over other
approaches: the number of epochs and width of the NN (i.e., the number of nodes in a layer) is reduced
at least by factor 1.25, and 6.66, respectively.

Specularity prediction is essential to many computer vision applications by giving important
visual cues that could be used in Augmented Reality (AR), Simultaneous Localisation and Mapping
(SLAM), 3D reconstruction and material modeling, thus improving scene understanding. However,
it is a challenging task requiring numerous information from the scene including the camera pose,
the geometry of the scene, the light sources and the material properties. Our previous work have
addressed this task by creating an explicit model using an ellipsoid whose projection fits the specularity
image contours for a given camera pose. These ellipsoid-based approaches belong to a family of models
called JOint-LIght MAterial Specularity (JOLIMAS), where we have attempted to gradually remove
assumptions on the scene such as the geometry of the specular surfaces. However, our most recent
approach is still limited to uniformly curved surfaces. This paper builds upon these methods by
generalising JOLIMAS to any surface geometry while improving the quality of specularity prediction,
without sacrificing computation performances. The proposed method establishes a link between
surface curvature and specularity shape in order to lift the geometric assumptions from previous
work. Contrary to previous work, our new model is built from a physics-based local illumination
model namely Torrance-Sparrow, providing a better model reconstruction. Specularity prediction
using our new model is tested against the most recent JOLIMAS version on both synthetic and real sequences
with objects of varying shape curvatures. Our method outperforms previous approaches in specularity
prediction, including the real-time setup, as shown in the supplementary material using videos.

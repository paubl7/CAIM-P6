Blood vessels of the brain are providing the human brain with the required nutrients and oxygen.
As a vulnerable part of the cerebral blood supply, pathology of small vessels can cause serious problems
such as Cerebral Small Vessel Diseases (CSVD). It has also been shown that CSVD is related to neurodegeneration,
such as in Alzheimer's disease. With the advancement of 7 Tesla MRI systems, higher spatial image
resolution can be achieved, enabling the depiction of very small vessels in the brain. Non-Deep
Learning based approaches for vessel segmentation, e.g. Frangi's vessel enhancement with subsequent
thresholding are capable of segmenting medium to large vessels but often fail to segment small vessels.
The sensitivity of these methods to small vessels can be increased by extensive parameter tuning
or by manual corrections, albeit making them time-consuming, laborious, and not feasible for larger
datasets. This paper proposes a deep learning architecture to automatically segment small vessels
in 7 Tesla 3D Time-of-Flight (ToF) Magnetic Resonance Angiography (MRA) data. The algorithm was
trained and evaluated on a small imperfect semi-automatically segmented dataset of only 11 subjects;
using six for training, two for validation and three for testing. Deep learning model based on U-Net
Multi-Scale Supervision was trained using the training subset and were made equivariant to elastic
deformations in a self-supervised manner using deformation-aware learning to improve the generalisation
performance. The proposed technique was evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively against
the test set and achieved a dice score of 80.44$\pm$0.83. Furthermore, the result of the proposed
method was compared against a selected manually segmented region (62.07 resultant dice) and has
shown a considerable improvement (18.98%) with deformation-aware learning.

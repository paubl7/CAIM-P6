Early diagnosis of lung cancer is a key intervention for the treatment of lung cancer computer aided
diagnosis (CAD) can play a crucial role. However, most published CAD methods treat lung cancer diagnosis
as a lung nodule classification problem, which does not reflect clinical practice, where clinicians
diagnose a patient based on a set of images of nodules, instead of one specific nodule. Besides, the
low interpretability of the output provided by these methods presents an important barrier for
their adoption. In this article, we treat lung cancer diagnosis as a multiple instance learning
(MIL) problem in order to better reflect the diagnosis process in the clinical setting and for the
higher interpretability of the output. We chose radiomics as the source of input features and deep
attention-based MIL as the classification algorithm.The attention mechanism provides higher
interpretability by estimating the importance of each instance in the set for the final diagnosis.In
order to improve the model's performance in a small imbalanced dataset, we introduce a new bag simulation
method for MIL.The results show that our method can achieve a mean accuracy of 0.807 with a standard
error of the mean (SEM) of 0.069, a recall of 0.870 (SEM 0.061), a positive predictive value of 0.928
(SEM 0.078), a negative predictive value of 0.591 (SEM 0.155) and an area under the curve (AUC) of
0.842 (SEM 0.074), outperforming other MIL methods.Additional experiments show that the proposed
oversampling strategy significantly improves the model's performance. In addition, our experiments
show that our method provides an indication of the importance of each nodule in determining the diagnosis,
which combined with the well-defined radiomic features, make the results more interpretable and
acceptable for doctors and patients.

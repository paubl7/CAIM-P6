Ranking functions are an integral component of web searching, and are thus subject to link spamming.
Quite a lot of practical and theoretical knowledge has accumulated about which types of ranking
functions are susceptible to which types of spam attacks, but there is no general characterization
of the class of spam attacks nor of the susceptibility of a ranking function to arbitrary spam attacks.
Our first contribution is a characterization of the class of spam attacks and a definition of the
spam resistance of a ranking function against all possible link-spam attacks. We show how this formal
notion of spam resistance matches the intuition of practitioners. This definition allows us to
evaluate novel ranking functions. A natural way to resist spam is to design a ranking function that
heavily favors trusted nodes, which are nodes known not be compromised by the spammer. However,
this introduces local distortions into the ranking function. We formalize this notion of distortion
and show that it matches the intuitive notion used by practitioners. We know of no ranking functions
in the literature that combine high spam resistance and low distortion; we consider several well-known
ranking functions (including the original form of PageRank) and show that they fail on one or both
counts. Finally, we introduce a new form of PageRank known as Min-PPR. We prove that Min-PPR has low
distortion and high spam resistance. A secondary benefit is that Min-PPR comes with an explicit
cost function on nodes that shows how important they are to the spammer; thus a ranker can focus their
spam-detection capacity on these vulnerable nodes. Both Min-PPR and its associated cost function
are straightforward to compute.

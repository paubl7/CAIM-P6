In the literature, a large body of work advocates the use of log-ratio transformation for multivariate
statistical analysis of compositional data. In contrast, few studies have looked at how data transformation
changes the efficacy of machine learning classifiers within geoscience. This letter presents
experiment results and empirical observations to further explore this issue. The objective is
to study the effects of data transformation on geozone classification performance when machine
learning (ML) classifiers/estimators are trained using geochemical data. The training input
consists of exploration hole assay samples obtained from a Pilbara iron-ore deposit in Western
Australia, and geozone labels assigned based on stratigraphic units, the absence or presence and
type of mineralization. The ML techniques considered are multinomial logistic regression, Gaussian
na\"{i}ve Bayes, kNN, linear support vector classifier, RBF-SVM, gradient boosting and extreme
GB, random forest (RF) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). The transformations examined include
isometric log-ratio (ILR), center log-ratio (CLR) coupled with principal component analysis
(PCA) or independent component analysis (ICA), and a manifold learning approach based on local
linear embedding (LLE). The results reveal that different ML classifiers exhibit varying sensitivity
to these transformations, with some clearly more advantageous or deleterious than others. Overall,
the best performing candidate is ILR which is unsurprising considering the compositional nature
of the data. The performance of pairwise log-ratio (PWLR) transformation is better than ILR for
ensemble and tree-based learners such as boosting and RF; but worse for MLP, SVM and other classifiers.

Research with AI and ML technologies lives in a variety of settings with often asynchronous goals
and timelines: academic labs and government organizations pursue open-ended research focusing
on discoveries with long-term value, while research in industry is driven by commercial pursuits
and hence focuses on short-term timelines and return on investment. The journey from research to
product is often tacit or ad hoc, resulting in technology transition failures, further exacerbated
when research and development is interorganizational and interdisciplinary. Even more, much
of the ability to produce results remains locked in the private repositories and know-how of the
individual researcher, slowing the impact on future research by others and contributing to the
ML community's challenges in reproducibility. With research organizations focused on an exploding
array of fields, opportunities for the handover and maturation of interdisciplinary research
reduce. With these tensions, we see an emerging need to measure the correctness, impact, and relevance
of research during its development to enable better collaboration, improved reproducibility,
faster progress, and more trusted outcomes. We perform a case study of the Frontier Development
Lab (FDL), an AI accelerator under a public-private partnership from NASA and ESA. FDL research
follows principled practices that are grounded in responsible development, conduct, and dissemination
of AI research, enabling FDL to churn successful interdisciplinary and interorganizational research
projects, measured through NASA's Technology Readiness Levels. We also take a look at the SpaceML
Open Source Research Program, which helps accelerate and transition FDL's research to deployable
projects with wide spread adoption amongst citizen scientists.

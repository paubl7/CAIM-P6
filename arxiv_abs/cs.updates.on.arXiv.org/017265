For smooth finite fields $F_q$ (i.e., when $q-1$ factors into small primes) the Fast Fourier Transform
(FFT) leads to the fastest known algebraic algorithms for many basic polynomial operations, such
as multiplication, division, interpolation and multi-point evaluation. However, the same operations
over fields with no smooth order root of unity suffer from an asymptotic slowdown. The classical
algorithm of Schonhage and Strassen incurred a multiplicative slowdown factor of $\log \log n$
on top of the smooth case. Recent remarkable results of Harvey, van der Hoeven and Lecerf dramatically
reduced this multiplicative overhead to $\exp(\log^* (n))$. We introduce a new approach to fast
algorithms for polynomial operations over all large finite fields. The key idea is to replace the
group of roots of unity with a set of points $L \subset F$ suitably related to a well-chosen elliptic
curve group (the set $L$ itself is not a group). The key advantage of this approach is that elliptic
curve groups can be of any size in the Hasse-Weil interval $[q+1 \pm 2\sqrt{q}]$ and thus can have
subgroups of large, smooth order, which an FFT-like divide and conquer algorithm can exploit. Compare
this with multiplicative subgroups over whose order must divide $q-1$. For polynomials represented
by their evaluation over subsets of $L$, we show that multiplication, division, degree-computation,
interpolation, evaluation and Reed-Solomon encoding (also known as low-degree extension) with
fixed evaluation points can all be computed with arithmetic circuits of size similar to what is achievable
with the classical FFTs when the field size is special. For several problems, this yields the asymptotically
smallest known arithmetic circuits even in the standard monomial representation of polynomials.

Research suggests that the duration of a VR session modulates the presence and intensity of VRISE,
but there are no suggestions regarding the appropriate maximum duration of VR sessions. The implementation
of high-end VR HMDs in conjunction with ergonomic VR software seems to mitigate the presence of VRISE
substantially. However, a brief tool does not currently exist to appraise and report both the quality
of software features and VRISE intensity quantitatively. The VRNQ was developed to assess the quality
of VR software in terms of user experience, game mechanics, in-game assistance, and VRISE. Forty
participants aged between 28 and 43 years were recruited (18 gamers and 22 non-gamers) for the study.
They participated in 3 different VR sessions until they felt weary or discomfort and subsequently
filled in the VRNQ. Our results demonstrated that VRNQ is a valid tool for assessing VR software as
it has good convergent, discriminant, and construct validity. The maximum duration of VR sessions
should be between 55-70 minutes when the VR software meets or exceeds the parsimonious cut-offs
of the VRNQ and the users are familiarized with the VR system. Also. the gaming experience does not
seem to affect how long VR sessions should last. Also, while the quality of VR software substantially
modulates the maximum duration of VR sessions, age and education do not. Finally, deeper immersion,
better quality of graphics and sound, and more helpful in-game instructions and prompts were found
to reduce VRISE intensity. The VRNQ facilitates the brief assessment and reporting of the quality
of VR software features and/or the intensity of VRISE, while its minimum and parsimonious cut-offs
may appraise the suitability of VR software. The findings of this study contribute to the establishment
of rigorous VR methods that are crucial for the viability of immersive VR as a research and clinical
tool.

Frequent temporal patterns discovered in time-interval-based multivariate data, although syntactically
correct, might be non-transparent: For some pattern instances, there might exist intervals for
the same entity that contradict the pattern's usual meaning. We conjecture that non-transparent
patterns are also less useful as classification or prediction features. We propose a new pruning
constraint during a frequent temporal-pattern discovery process, the Semantic Adjacency Criterion
[SAC], which exploits domain knowledge to filter out patterns that contain potentially semantically
contradictory components. We have defined three SAC versions, and tested their effect in three
medical domains. We embedded these criteria in a frequent-temporal-pattern discovery framework.
Previously, we had informally presented the SAC principle and showed that using it to prune patterns
enhances the repeatability of their discovery in the same clinical domain. Here, we define formally
the semantics of three SAC variations, and compare the use of the set of pruned patterns to the use
of the complete set of discovered patterns, as features for classification and prediction tasks
in three different medical domains. We induced four classifiers for each task, using four machine-learning
methods: Random Forests, Naive Bayes, SVM, and Logistic Regression. The features were frequent
temporal patterns discovered in each data set. SAC-based temporal pattern-discovery reduced
by up to 97% the number of discovered patterns and by up to 98% the discovery runtime. But the classification
and prediction performance of the reduced SAC-based pattern-based features set, was as good as
when using the complete set. Using SAC can significantly reduce the number of discovered frequent
interval-based temporal patterns, and the corresponding computational effort, without losing
classification or prediction performance.

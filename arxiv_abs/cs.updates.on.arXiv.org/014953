[...] We argue that the traditional grasp modeling theory assumes a complexity that most robotic
hands do not possess and is therefore of limited applicability to the robotic hands commonly used
today. We discuss these limitations of the existing grasp modeling literature and set out to develop
our own tools for the analysis of passive effects in robotic grasping. We show that problems of this
kind are difficult to solve due to the non-convexity of the Maximum Dissipation Principle (MDP),
which is part of the Coulomb friction law. We show that for planar grasps the MDP can be decomposed
into a number of piecewise convex problems, which can be solved for efficiently. [...] Thus, we present
the first polynomial runtime algorithm for the determination of passive stability of planar grasps.
For the spacial case we [...] describe a convex relaxation of the Coulomb friction law and a successive
hierarchical tightening approach that allows us to find solutions to the exact problem including
the maximum dissipation principle. [...] The generality of our grasp model allows us to solve a wide
variety of problems such as the computation of optimal actuator commands. This makes our framework
a valuable tool for practical manipulation applications. Our work is relevant beyond robotic manipulation
as it applies to the stability of any assembly of rigid bodies with frictional contacts, unilateral
constraints and externally applied wrenches. Finally, we argue that with the advent of data-driven
methods as well as the emergence of a new generation of highly sensorized hands there are opportunities
for the application of the traditional grasp modeling theory to fields such as robotic in-hand manipulation
through model-free reinforcement learning. We present a method that applies traditional grasp
models to maintain quasi-static stability throughout a nominally model-free reinforcement learning
task. [...]

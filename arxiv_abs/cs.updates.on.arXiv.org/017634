The current development of vaccines for SARS-CoV-2 is unprecedented. Little is known, however,
about the nuanced public opinions on the vaccines on social media. We adopt a human-guided machine
learning framework using more than six million tweets from almost two million unique Twitter users
to capture public opinions on the potential vaccines for SARS-CoV-2, classifying them into three
groups: pro-vaccine, vaccine-hesitant, and anti-vaccine. We aggregate opinions at the state
and country levels, and find that the major changes in the percentages of different opinion groups
roughly correspond to the major pandemic-related events. Interestingly, the percentage of the
pro-vaccine group is lower in the Southeast part of the United States. Using multinomial logistic
regression, we compare demographics, social capital, income, religious status, political affiliations,
geo-locations, sentiment of personal pandemic experience and non-pandemic experience, and county-level
pandemic severity perception of these three groups to investigate the scope and causes of public
opinions on vaccines. We find that socioeconomically disadvantaged groups are more likely to hold
polarized opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines. People who have the worst personal pandemic
experience are more likely to hold the anti-vaccine opinion. Next, by conducting counterfactual
analyses, we find that the U.S. public is most concerned about the safety, effectiveness, and political
issues regarding potential vaccines for COVID-19, and improving personal pandemic experience
increases the vaccine acceptance level. We believe this is the first large-scale social media-based
study to analyze public opinions on potential COVID-19 vaccines that can inform more effective
vaccine distribution policies and strategies.

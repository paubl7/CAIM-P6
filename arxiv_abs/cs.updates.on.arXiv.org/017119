Public blockchains have spurred the growing popularity of decentralized transactions and smart
contracts, but they exhibit limitations on the transaction throughput, storage, and computation.
To avoid transaction gridlock, public blockchains impose large fees and per-block resource limits,
making it difficult to accommodate the ever-growing transaction demand. Previous research endeavors
to improve the scalability of blockchain through various technologies, such as side-chaining,
sharding, secured off-chain computation, communication network optimizations, and efficient
consensus protocols. However, these approaches have not attained a widespread adoption due to
their inability in delivering a cloud-like performance, in terms of the scalability in transaction
throughput, storage, and compute capacity. In this work, we determine that the major obstacle to
public blockchain scalability is their underlying unstructured P2P networks. We further show
that a centralized network can support the deployment of decentralized smart contracts. We propose
a novel approach for achieving scalable decentralization: instead of trying to make blockchain
scalable, we deliver decentralization to already scalable cloud by using an Ethereum smart contract.
We introduce Blockumulus, a framework that can deploy decentralized cloud smart contract environments
using a novel technique called overlay consensus. Through experiments, we demonstrate that Blockumulus
is scalable in all three dimensions: computation, data storage, and transaction throughput. Besides
eliminating the current code execution and storage restrictions, Blockumulus delivers a transaction
latency between 2 and 5 seconds under normal load. Moreover, the stress test of our prototype reveals
the ability to execute 20,000 simultaneous transactions under 26 seconds, which is on par with the
average throughput of worldwide credit card transactions.

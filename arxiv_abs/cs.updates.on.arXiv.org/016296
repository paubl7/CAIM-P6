Since the start of Indian cinema, a number of films have been made where a particular song is based
on a certain raga. These songs have been taking a major role in spreading the essence of classical
music to the common people, who have no formal exposure to classical music. In this paper, we look
to explore what are the particular features of a certain raga which make it understandable to common
people and enrich the song to a great extent. For this, we chose two common ragas of Hindustani classical
music, namely "Bhairav" and "Mian ki Malhar" which are known to have widespread application in popular
film music. We have taken 3 minute clips of these two ragas from the renderings of two eminent maestros
of Hindustani classical music. 3 min clips of ten (10) widely popular songs of Bollywood films were
selected for analysis. These were analyzed with the help of a latest non linear analysis technique
called Multifractal Detrended Cross correlation Analysis (MFDXA). With this technique, all parts
of the Film music and the renderings from the eminent maestros are analyzed to find out a cross correlation
coefficient ({\gamma}x) which gives the degree of correlation between these two signals. We hypothesize
that the parts which have the highest degree of cross correlation are the parts in which that particular
raga is established in the song. Also the variation of cross correlation coefficient in the different
parts of the two samples gives a measure of the modulation that is executed by the singer. Thus, in
nutshell we try to study scientifically the amount of correlation that exists between the raga and
the same raga being utilized in Film music. This will help in generating an automated algorithm through
which a na\"ive listener will relish the flavor of a particular raga in a popular film song. The results
are discussed in detail.

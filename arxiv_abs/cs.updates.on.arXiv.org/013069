As it follows from G\"odel's incompleteness theorems, any consistent formal system of axioms and
rules of inference should imply a true unprovable statement. Actually, this fundamental principle
can be efficiently applicable in computational mathematics and complexity theory concerning
the computational complexity of problems from the class NP, particularly and especially the NP-complete
ones. While there is a wide set of algorithms for these problems that we call heuristic, the correctness
or/and complexity of each concrete algorithm (or the probability of its correct and polynomial-time
work) on a class of instances is often too difficult to determine, although we may also assume the
existence of a variety of algorithms for NP-complete problems that are both correct and polynomial-time
on all the instances from a given class (where the given problem remains NP-complete), but whose
correctness or/and polynomial-time complexity on the class is impossible to prove as an example
for G\"odel's theorems. However, supposedly such algorithms should possess a certain complicatedness
of processing the input data and treat it in a certain algebraically "entangled" manner. The same
algorithmic analysis in fact concerns all the other significant problems and subclasses of NP,
such as the graph isomorphism problem and its associated complexity class GI. The following short
article offers a couple of algebraically entangled polynomial-time algorithms for the graph isomorphism
and clique problems whose correctness is yet to be determined either empirically or through attempting
to find proofs. The authors are grateful to Prof. Anuj Dawar (University of Cambridge) for kindly
endorsing the present article for publishing in arXiv.

Background: Oral histories from 9/11 responders to the World Trade Center (WTC) attacks provide
rich narratives about distress and resilience. Artificial Intelligence (AI) models promise to
detect psychopathology in natural language, but they have been evaluated primarily in non-clinical
settings using social media. This study sought to test the ability of AI-based language assessments
to predict PTSD symptom trajectories among responders. Methods: Participants were 124 responders
whose health was monitored at the Stony Brook WTC Health and Wellness Program who completed oral
history interviews about their initial WTC experiences. PTSD symptom severity was measured longitudinally
using the PTSD Checklist (PCL) for up to 7 years post-interview. AI-based indicators were computed
for depression, anxiety, neuroticism, and extraversion along with dictionary-based measures
of linguistic and interpersonal style. Linear regression and multilevel models estimated associations
of AI indicators with concurrent and subsequent PTSD symptom severity (significance adjusted
by false discovery rate). Results: Cross-sectionally, greater depressive language (beta=0.32;
p=0.043) and first-person singular usage (beta=0.31; p=0.044) were associated with increased
symptom severity. Longitudinally, anxious language predicted future worsening in PCL scores
(beta=0.31; p=0.031), whereas first-person plural usage (beta=-0.37; p=0.007) and longer words
usage (beta=-0.36; p=0.007) predicted improvement. Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate
the value of AI in understanding PTSD in a vulnerable population. Future studies should extend this
application to other trauma exposures and to other demographic groups, especially under-represented
minorities.

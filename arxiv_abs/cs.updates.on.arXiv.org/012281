Large software organizations handle many customer support issues every day in the form of bug reports,
feature requests, and general misunderstandings as submitted by customers. Strategies to gather,
analyze, and negotiate requirements are complemented by efforts to manage customer input after
products have been deployed. For the latter, support tickets are key in allowing customers to submit
their issues, bug reports, and feature requests. Whenever insufficient attention is given to support
issues, there is a chance customers will escalate their issues, and escalation to management is
time-consuming and expensive, especially for large organizations managing hundreds of customers
and thousands of support tickets. This thesis provides a step towards simplifying the job for support
analysts and managers, particularly in predicting the risk of escalating support tickets. In a
field study at our large industrial partner, IBM, a design science methodology was employed to characterize
the support process and data available to IBM analysts in managing escalations. Through iterative
cycles of design and evaluation, support analysts' expert knowledge about their customers was
translated into features of a support ticket model to be implemented into a Machine Learning model
to predict support ticket escalations. The Machine Learning model was trained and evaluated on
over 2.5 million support tickets and 10,000 escalations, obtaining a recall of 79.9% and an 80.8%
reduction in the workload for support analysts looking to identify support tickets at risk of escalation.
The features developed in the Support Ticket Model are designed to serve as a starting place for organizations
interested in implementing the model to predict support ticket escalations, and for future researchers
to build on to advance research in Escalation Prediction.

Lobar cerebral microbleeds (CMBs) and localized non-hemorrhage iron deposits in the basal ganglia
have been associated with brain aging, vascular disease and neurodegenerative disorders. Particularly,
CMBs are small lesions and require multiple neuroimaging modalities for accurate detection. Quantitative
susceptibility mapping (QSM) derived from in vivo magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is necessary
to differentiate between iron content and mineralization. We set out to develop a deep learning-based
segmentation method suitable for segmenting both CMBs and iron deposits. We included a convenience
sample of 24 participants from the MESA cohort and used T2-weighted images, susceptibility weighted
imaging (SWI), and QSM to segment the two types of lesions. We developed a protocol for simultaneous
manual annotation of CMBs and non-hemorrhage iron deposits in the basal ganglia. This manual annotation
was then used to train a deep convolution neural network (CNN). Specifically, we adapted the U-Net
model with a higher number of resolution layers to be able to detect small lesions such as CMBs from
standard resolution MRI. We tested different combinations of the three modalities to determine
the most informative data sources for the detection tasks. In the detection of CMBs using single
class and multiclass models, we achieved an average sensitivity and precision of between 0.84-0.88
and 0.40-0.59, respectively. The same framework detected non-hemorrhage iron deposits with an
average sensitivity and precision of about 0.75-0.81 and 0.62-0.75, respectively. Our results
showed that deep learning could automate the detection of small vessel disease lesions and including
multimodal MR data (particularly QSM) can improve the detection of CMB and non-hemorrhage iron
deposits with sensitivity and precision that is compatible with use in large-scale research studies.

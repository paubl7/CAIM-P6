Accurate extraction of breast cancer patients' phenotypes is important for clinical decision
support and clinical research. Current models do not take full advantage of cancer domain-specific
corpus, whether pre-training Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformer model
on cancer-specific corpus could improve the performances of extracting breast cancer phenotypes
from texts data remains to be explored. The objective of this study is to develop and evaluate the
CancerBERT model for extracting breast cancer phenotypes from clinical texts in electronic health
records. This data used in the study included 21,291 breast cancer patients diagnosed from 2010
to 2020, patients' clinical notes and pathology reports were collected from the University of Minnesota
Clinical Data Repository (UMN). Results: About 3 million clinical notes and pathology reports
in electronic health records for 21,291 breast cancer patients were collected to train the CancerBERT
model. 200 pathology reports and 50 clinical notes of breast cancer patients that contain 9,685
sentences and 221,356 tokens were manually annotated by two annotators. 20% of the annotated data
was used as a test set. Our CancerBERT model achieved the best performance with macro F1 scores equal
to 0.876 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) for exact match and 0.904 (95% CI, 0.896-0.902) for the lenient match.
The NER models we developed would facilitate the automated information extraction from clinical
texts to further help clinical decision support. Conclusions and Relevance: In this study, we focused
on the breast cancer-related concepts extraction from EHR data and obtained a comprehensive annotated
dataset that contains 7 types of breast cancer-related concepts. The CancerBERT model with customized
vocabulary could significantly improve the performance for extracting breast cancer phenotypes
from clinical texts.

Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarm control has applications including target tracking, surveillance,
terrain mapping, and precision agriculture. Decentralized control methods are particularly
useful when the swarm is large, as centralized methods (a single command center controlling the
UAVs) suffer from exponential computational complexity, i.e., the computing time to obtain the
optimal control for the UAVs grow exponentially with the number of UAVs in the swarm in centralized
approaches. Although many centralized control methods exist, literature lacks decentralized
control frameworks with broad applicability. To address this knowledge gap, we present a novel
decentralized UAV swarm control strategy using a decision-theoretic framework called decentralized
Markov decision process (Dec-MDP). We build these control strategies in the context of two case
studies: a) swarm formation control problem; b) swarm control for multitarget tracking. As most
decision theoretic formulations suffer from the curse of dimensionality, we adapt an approximate
dynamic programming method called nominal belief-state optimization (NBO) to solve the decentralized
control problems approximately in both the case studies. In the formation control case study, the
objective is to drive the swarm from a geographical region to another geographical region where
the swarm must form a certain geometrical shape (e.g., selected location on the surface of a sphere).
The motivation for studying such problems comes from data fusion applications with UAV swarms where
the fusion performance depends on the strategic relative separation of the UAVs from each other.
In the target tracking case study, the objective is the control the motion of the UAVs in a decentralized
manner while maximizing the overall target tracking performance. Motivation for this case study
comes from the surveillance applications using UAV swarms.

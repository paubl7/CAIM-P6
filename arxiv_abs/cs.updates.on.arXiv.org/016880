Driving behavior modeling is of great importance for designing safe, smart, and personalized autonomous
driving systems. In this paper, an internal reward function-based driving model that emulates
the human's decision-making mechanism is utilized. To infer the reward function parameters from
naturalistic human driving data, we propose a structural assumption about human driving behavior
that focuses on discrete latent driving intentions. It converts the continuous behavior modeling
problem to a discrete setting and thus makes maximum entropy inverse reinforcement learning (IRL)
tractable to learn reward functions. Specifically, a polynomial trajectory sampler is adopted
to generate candidate trajectories considering high-level intentions and approximate the partition
function in the maximum entropy IRL framework. An environment model considering interactive behaviors
among the ego and surrounding vehicles is built to better estimate the generated trajectories.
The proposed method is applied to learn personalized reward functions for individual human drivers
from the NGSIM highway driving dataset. The qualitative results demonstrate that the learned reward
functions are able to explicitly express the preferences of different drivers and interpret their
decisions. The quantitative results reveal that the learned reward functions are robust, which
is manifested by only a marginal decline in proximity to the human driving trajectories when applying
the reward function in the testing conditions. For the testing performance, the personalized modeling
method outperforms the general modeling approach, significantly reducing the modeling errors
in human likeness (a custom metric to gauge accuracy), and these two methods deliver better results
compared to other baseline methods.

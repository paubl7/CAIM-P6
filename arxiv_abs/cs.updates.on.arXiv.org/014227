The performance of wireless networks is fundamentally limited by the aggregate interference,
which depends on the spatial distributions of the interferers, channel conditions, and user traffic
patterns (or queueing dynamics). These factors usually exhibit spatial and temporal correlations
and thus make the performance of large-scale networks environment-dependent (i.e., dependent
on network topology, locations of the blockages, etc.). The correlation can be exploited in protocol
designs (e.g., spectrum-, load-, location-, energy-aware resource allocations) to provide efficient
wireless services. For this, accurate system-level performance characterization and evaluation
with spatio-temporal correlation are required. In this context, stochastic geometry models and
random graph techniques have been used to develop analytical frameworks to capture the spatio-temporal
interference correlation in large-scale wireless networks. The objective of this article is to
provide a tutorial on the stochastic geometry analysis of large-scale wireless networks that captures
the spatio-temporal interference correlation (and hence the signal-to-interference ratio (SIR)
correlation). We first discuss the importance of spatio-temporal performance analysis, different
parameters affecting the spatio-temporal correlation in the SIR, and the different performance
metrics for spatio-temporal analysis. Then we describe the methodologies to characterize spatio-temporal
SIR correlations for different network configurations (independent, attractive, repulsive
configurations), shadowing scenarios, user locations, queueing behavior, relaying, retransmission,
and mobility. We conclude by outlining future research directions in the context of spatio-temporal
analysis of emerging wireless communications scenarios.

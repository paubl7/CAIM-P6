The theme of human mobility is transversal to multiple fields of study and applications, from ad-hoc
networks to smart cities, from transportation planning to recommendation systems on social networks.
Despite the considerable efforts made by a few scientific communities and the relevant results
obtained so far, there are still many issues only partially solved, that ask for general and quantitative
methodologies to be addressed. A prominent aspect of scientific and practical relevance is how
to characterize the mobility behavior of individuals. In this article, we look at the problem from
a location-centric perspective: we investigate methods to extract, classify and quantify the
symbolic locations specified in telco trajectories, and use such measures to feature user mobility.
A major contribution is a novel trajectory summarization technique for the extraction of the locations
of interest, i.e. attractive, from symbolic trajectories. The method is built on a density-based
trajectory segmentation technique tailored to telco data, which is proven to be robust against
noise. To inspect the nature of those locations, we combine the two dimensions of location attractiveness
and frequency into a novel location taxonomy, which allows for a more accurate classification of
the visited places. Another major contribution is the selection of suitable entropy-based metrics
for the characterization of single trajectories, based on the diversity of the locations of interest.
All these components are integrated in a framework utilized for the analysis of 100,000+ telco trajectories.
The experiments show how the framework manages to dramatically reduce data complexity, provide
high-quality information on the mobility behavior of people and finally succeed in grasping the
nature of the locations visited by individuals.

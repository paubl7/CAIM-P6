Manual or automatic delineation of the esophageal tumor in CT images is known to be very challenging.
This is due to the low contrast between the tumor and adjacent tissues, the anatomical variation
of the esophagus, as well as the occasional presence of foreign bodies (e.g. feeding tubes). Physicians
therefore usually exploit additional knowledge such as endoscopic findings, clinical history,
additional imaging modalities like PET scans. Achieving his additional information is time-consuming,
while the results are error-prone and might lead to non-deterministic results. In this paper we
aim to investigate if and to what extent a simplified clinical workflow based on CT alone, allows
one to automatically segment the esophageal tumor with sufficient quality. For this purpose, we
present a fully automatic end-to-end esophageal tumor segmentation method based on convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). The proposed network, called Dilated Dense Attention Unet (DDAUnet),
leverages spatial and channel attention gates in each dense block to selectively concentrate on
determinant feature maps and regions. Dilated convolutional layers are used to manage GPU memory
and increase the network receptive field. We collected a dataset of 792 scans from 288 distinct patients
including varying anatomies with \mbox{air pockets}, feeding tubes and proximal tumors. Repeatability
and reproducibility studies were conducted for three distinct splits of training and validation
sets. The proposed network achieved a $\mathrm{DSC}$ value of $0.79 \pm 0.20$, a mean surface distance
of $5.4 \pm 20.2mm$ and $95\%$ Hausdorff distance of $14.7 \pm 25.0mm$ for 287 test scans, demonstrating
promising results with a simplified clinical workflow based on CT alone. Our code is publicly available

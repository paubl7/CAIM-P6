With the advance in user-friendly and powerful video editing tools, anyone can easily manipulate
videos without leaving prominent visual traces. Frame-rate up-conversion (FRUC), a representative
temporal-domain operation, increases the motion continuity of videos with a lower frame-rate
and is used by malicious counterfeiters in video tampering such as generating fake frame-rate video
without improving the quality or mixing temporally spliced videos. FRUC is based on frame interpolation
schemes and subtle artifacts that remain in interpolated frames are often difficult to distinguish.
Hence, detecting such forgery traces is a critical issue in video forensics. This paper proposes
a frame-rate conversion detection network (FCDNet) that learns forensic features caused by FRUC
in an end-to-end fashion. The proposed network uses a stack of consecutive frames as the input and
effectively learns interpolation artifacts using network blocks to learn spatiotemporal features.
This study is the first attempt to apply a neural network to the detection of FRUC. Moreover, it can
cover the following three types of frame interpolation schemes: nearest neighbor interpolation,
bilinear interpolation, and motion-compensated interpolation. In contrast to existing methods
that exploit all frames to verify integrity, the proposed approach achieves a high detection speed
because it observes only six frames to test its authenticity. Extensive experiments were conducted
with conventional forensic methods and neural networks for video forensic tasks to validate our
research. The proposed network achieved state-of-the-art performance in terms of detecting the
interpolated artifacts of FRUC. The experimental results also demonstrate that our trained model
is robust for an unseen dataset, unlearned frame-rate, and unlearned quality factor.

Beamforming methods for sound source localization are usually based on free-field Green's functions
to model the sound propagation between source and microphone. This assumption is known to be incorrect
for many industrial applications and the beamforming results can suffer from this inconsistency
regarding both, accuracy of source power estimation, and accuracy of source localisation. The
aim of this paper is to investigate whether the use of numerically calculated Green's functions
can improve the results of beamforming measurements. The current test cases of numerical and experimental
investigations consists of sources placed in a short rectangular duct. The measurement is performed
outside the duct in a semi-anechoic chamber. A typical example for this kind of installation is a
fan with a heat exchanger. The Green's functions for this test case are calculated numerically using
the boundary element method. These tailored Green's functions are used to calculate the corresponding
beamforming steering vectors. The weighting of the Green's functions in the steering vectors has
a decisive influence on the beamforming results. A generalization of the common steering vector
formulations is given based on two scalars. It is shown that arbitrary differentiable Green's functions
can be used to find the correct source position or source power level by using the appropriate steering
vector formulations. Beamforming measurements are performed using a loudspeaker as a reference
source at different positions in the heat exchanger duct. The measurements are evaluated in the
frequency domain and by means of different validation criteria it can be shown that the results with
the numerical calculated Green's function are improved compared to free field beamforming especially
at low frequencies.

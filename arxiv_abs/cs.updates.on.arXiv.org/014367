Context: Security and performance (S&P) are critical non-functional requirements on software
systems. Therefore, verification activities should be included in the development process to
identify related defects and avoiding S&P failures after deployment. However, the state of the
practice of S&P verification is unclear, challenging academia to offer solutions for real-world
problems faced by the S&P verification practitioners. Thus, identifying factors moderating the
S&P verification helps software development organizations improve the S&P verification, releasing
software that meets security and performance requirements. Objective: To present moderator factors
influencing S&P verification activities and actions to promote S&P moderator factors. Method:
Multiple case study using qualitative analysis of observational data to identify S&P moderators
factors. Literature Rapid Reviews with Snowballing to strengthen confidence in the identified
S&P moderators factors. Practitioners Survey to classify the S&P moderator factors regarding
their relevance. Results: Identification of eight S&P moderator factors regarding organizational
awareness, crossfunctional team, S&P requirements, support tools, verification environment,
verification methodology, verification planning, and reuse practices. The literature reviews
allowed us to confirm the identified S&P moderator factors and identify a set of actions to promote
each of them. A survey with 37 valid participants allowed us to classify the identified S&P moderators
factors and their actions relevant to S&P verification activities. Conclusions: The S&P moderator
factors can be considered key points in which software development organizations should invest
to implement or improve S&P verification activities.

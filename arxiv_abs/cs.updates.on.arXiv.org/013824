Simulations, along with other similar applications like virtual worlds and video games, require
computational models of intelligence that generate realistic and credible behavior for the participating
synthetic characters. Cognitive architectures, which are models of the fixed structure underlying
intelligent behavior in both natural and artificial systems, provide a conceptually valid common
basis, as evidenced by the current efforts towards a standard model of the mind, to generate human-like
intelligent behavior for these synthetic characters. Sigma is a cognitive architecture and system
that strives to combine what has been learned from four decades of independent work on symbolic cognitive
architectures, probabilistic graphical models, and more recently neural models, under its graphical
architecture hypothesis. Sigma leverages an extended form of factor graphs towards a uniform grand
unification of not only traditional cognitive capabilities but also key non-cognitive aspects,
creating unique opportunities for the construction of new kinds of cognitive models that possess
a Theory-of-Mind and that are perceptual, autonomous, interactive, affective, and adaptive.
In this paper, we will introduce Sigma along with its diverse capabilities and then use three distinct
proof-of-concept Sigma models to highlight combinations of these capabilities: (1) Distributional
reinforcement learning models in; (2) A pair of adaptive and interactive agent models that demonstrate
rule-based, probabilistic, and social reasoning; and (3) A knowledge-free exploration model
in which an agent leverages only architectural appraisal variables, namely attention and curiosity,
to locate an item while building up a map in a Unity environment.

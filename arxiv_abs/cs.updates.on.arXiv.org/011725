We study the communication complexity of computing functions $F:\{0,1\}^n\times \{0,1\}^n \rightarrow
\{0,1\}$ in the memoryless communication model. Here, Alice is given $x\in \{0,1\}^n$, Bob is given
$y\in \{0,1\}^n$ and their goal is to compute F(x,y) subject to the following constraint: at every
round, Alice receives a message from Bob and her reply to Bob solely depends on the message received
and her input x; the same applies to Bob. The cost of computing F in this model is the maximum number
of bits exchanged in any round between Alice and Bob (on the worst case input x,y). In this paper, we
also consider variants of our memoryless model wherein one party is allowed to have memory, the parties
are allowed to communicate quantum bits, only one player is allowed to send messages. We show that
our memoryless communication model capture the garden-hose model of computation by Buhrman et
al. (ITCS'13), space bounded communication complexity by Brody et al. (ITCS'13) and the overlay
communication complexity by Papakonstantinou et al. (CCC'14). Thus the memoryless communication
complexity model provides a unified framework to study space-bounded communication models. We
establish the following: (1) We show that the memoryless communication complexity of F equals the
logarithm of the size of the smallest bipartite branching program computing F (up to a factor 2);
(2) We show that memoryless communication complexity equals garden-hose complexity; (3) We exhibit
various exponential separations between these memoryless communication models. We end with an
intriguing open question: can we find an explicit function F and universal constant c>1 for which
the memoryless communication complexity is at least $c \log n$? Note that $c\geq 2+\varepsilon$
would imply a $\Omega(n^{2+\varepsilon})$ lower bound for general formula size, improving upon
the best lower bound by Ne\v{c}iporuk in 1966.

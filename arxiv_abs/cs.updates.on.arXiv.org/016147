The 4th edition of the Montreal AI Ethics Institute's The State of AI Ethics captures the most relevant
developments in the field of AI Ethics since January 2021. This report aims to help anyone, from machine
learning experts to human rights activists and policymakers, quickly digest and understand the
ever-changing developments in the field. Through research and article summaries, as well as expert
commentary, this report distills the research and reporting surrounding various domains related
to the ethics of AI, with a particular focus on four key themes: Ethical AI, Fairness & Justice, Humans
& Tech, and Privacy. In addition, The State of AI Ethics includes exclusive content written by world-class
AI Ethics experts from universities, research institutes, consulting firms, and governments.
Opening the report is a long-form piece by Edward Higgs (Professor of History, University of Essex)
titled "AI and the Face: A Historian's View." In it, Higgs examines the unscientific history of facial
analysis and how AI might be repeating some of those mistakes at scale. The report also features chapter
introductions by Alexa Hagerty (Anthropologist, University of Cambridge), Marianna Ganapini
(Faculty Director, Montreal AI Ethics Institute), Deborah G. Johnson (Emeritus Professor, Engineering
and Society, University of Virginia), and Soraj Hongladarom (Professor of Philosophy and Director,
Center for Science, Technology and Society, Chulalongkorn University in Bangkok). This report
should be used not only as a point of reference and insight on the latest thinking in the field of AI
Ethics, but should also be used as a tool for introspection as we aim to foster a more nuanced conversation
regarding the impacts of AI on the world.

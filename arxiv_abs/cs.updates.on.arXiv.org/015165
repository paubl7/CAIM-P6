Generative modelling has been a topic at the forefront of machine learning research for a substantial
amount of time. With the recent success in the field of machine learning, especially in deep learning,
there has been an increased interest in explainable and interpretable machine learning. The ability
to model distributions and provide insight in the density estimation and exact data likelihood
is an example of such a feature. Normalizing Flows (NFs), a relatively new research field of generative
modelling, has received substantial attention since it is able to do exactly this at a relatively
low cost whilst enabling competitive generative results. While the generative abilities of NFs
are typically explored, we focus on exploring the data distribution modelling for Out-of-Distribution
(OOD) detection. Using one of the state-of-the-art NF models, GLOW, we attempt to detect OOD examples
in the ISIC dataset. We notice that this model under performs in conform related research. To improve
the OOD detection, we explore the masking methods to inhibit co-adaptation of the coupling layers
however find no substantial improvement. Furthermore, we utilize Wavelet Flow which uses wavelets
that can filter particular frequency components, thus simplifying the modeling process to data-driven
conditional wavelet coefficients instead of complete images. This enables us to efficiently model
larger resolution images in the hopes that it would capture more relevant features for OOD. The paper
that introduced Wavelet Flow mainly focuses on its ability of sampling high resolution images and
did not treat OOD detection. We present the results and propose several ideas for improvement such
as controlling frequency components, using different wavelets and using other state-of-the-art
NF architectures.

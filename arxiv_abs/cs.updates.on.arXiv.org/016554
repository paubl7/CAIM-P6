Technological advances in information sharing have raised concerns about data protection. Privacy
policies contain privacy-related requirements about how the personal data of individuals will
be handled by an organization or a software system (e.g., a web service or an app). In Europe, privacy
policies are subject to compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). A prerequisite
for GDPR compliance checking is to verify whether the content of a privacy policy is complete according
to the provisions of GDPR. Incomplete privacy policies might result in large fines on violating
organization as well as incomplete privacy-related software specifications. Manual completeness
checking is both time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we propose AI-based automation
for the completeness checking of privacy policies. Through systematic qualitative methods, we
first build two artifacts to characterize the privacy-related provisions of GDPR, namely a conceptual
model and a set of completeness criteria. Then, we develop an automated solution on top of these artifacts
by leveraging a combination of natural language processing and supervised machine learning. Specifically,
we identify the GDPR-relevant information content in privacy policies and subsequently check
them against the completeness criteria. To evaluate our approach, we collected 234 real privacy
policies from the fund industry. Over a set of 48 unseen privacy policies, our approach detected
300 of the total of 334 violations of some completeness criteria correctly, while producing 23 false
positives. The approach thus has a precision of 92.9% and recall of 89.8%. Compared to a baseline
that applies keyword search only, our approach results in an improvement of 24.5% in precision and
38% in recall.

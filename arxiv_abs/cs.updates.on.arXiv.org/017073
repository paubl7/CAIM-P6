Choiceless Polynomial Time (CPT) is currently the only candidate logic for capturing PTIME (that
is, it is contained in PTIME and has not been separated from it). A prominent example of a decision
problem in PTIME that is not known to be CPT-definable is the isomorphism problem on unordered Cai-F\"urer-Immerman
graphs (the CFI-query). We study the expressive power of CPT with respect to this problem and develop
a partial characterisation of solvable instances in terms of properties of symmetric XOR-circuits
over the CFI-graphs: The CFI-query is CPT-definable on a given class of graphs only if: For each graph
$G$, there exists an XOR-circuit $C$, whose input gates are labelled with edges of $G$, such that
$C$ is sufficiently symmetric with respect to the automorphisms of $G$ and satisfies certain other
circuit properties. We also give a sufficient condition for CFI being solvable in CPT and develop
a new CPT-algorithm for the CFI-query. It takes as input structures which contain, along with the
CFI-graph, an XOR-circuit with suitable properties. The strongest known CPT-algorithm for this
problem can solve instances equipped with a preorder with colour classes of logarithmic size. Our
result implicitly extends this to preorders with colour classes of polylogarithmic size (plus
some unordered additional structure). Finally, our work provides new insights regarding a much
more general problem: The existence of a solution to an unordered linear equation system $A \cdot
x = b$ over a finite field is CPT-definable if the matrix $A$ has at most logarithmic rank (with respect
to the size of the structure that encodes the equation system). This is another example that separates
CPT from fixed-point logic with counting.

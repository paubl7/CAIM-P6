Change detection, which aims to distinguish surface changes based on bi-temporal images, plays
a vital role in ecological protection and urban planning. Since high resolution (HR) images cannot
be typically acquired continuously over time, bi-temporal images with different resolutions
are often adopted for change detection in practical applications. Traditional subpixel-based
methods for change detection using images with different resolutions may lead to substantial error
accumulation when HR images are employed; this is because of intraclass heterogeneity and interclass
similarity. Therefore, it is necessary to develop a novel method for change detection using images
with different resolutions, that is more suitable for HR images. To this end, we propose a super-resolution-based
change detection network (SRCDNet) with a stacked attention module. The SRCDNet employs a super
resolution (SR) module containing a generator and a discriminator to directly learn SR images through
adversarial learning and overcome the resolution difference between bi-temporal images. To enhance
the useful information in multi-scale features, a stacked attention module consisting of five
convolutional block attention modules (CBAMs) is integrated to the feature extractor. The final
change map is obtained through a metric learning-based change decision module, wherein a distance
map between bi-temporal features is calculated. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority
of the proposed method, which not only outperforms all baselines -with the highest F1 scores of 87.40%
on the building change detection dataset and 92.94% on the change detection dataset -but also obtains
the best accuracies on experiments performed with images having a 4x and 8x resolution difference.

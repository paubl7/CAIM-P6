As the quantity and complexity of information processed by software systems increase, large-scale
software systems have an increasing requirement for high-performance distributed computing
systems. With the acceleration of the Internet in Web 2.0, Cloud computing as a paradigm to provide
dynamic, uncertain and elastic services has shown superiorities to meet the computing needs dynamically.
Without an appropriate scheduling approach, extensive Cloud computing may cause high energy consumptions
and high cost, in addition that high energy consumption will cause massive carbon dioxide emissions.
Moreover, inappropriate scheduling will reduce the service life of physical devices as well as
increase response time to users' request. Hence, efficient scheduling of resource or optimal allocation
of request, that usually a NP-hard problem, is one of the prominent issues in emerging trends of Cloud
computing. Focusing on improving quality of service (QoS), reducing cost and abating contamination,
researchers have conducted extensive work on resource scheduling problems of Cloud computing
over years. Nevertheless, growing complexity of Cloud computing, that the super-massive distributed
system, is limiting the application of scheduling approaches. Machine learning, a utility method
to tackle problems in complex scenes, is used to resolve the resource scheduling of Cloud computing
as an innovative idea in recent years. Deep reinforcement learning (DRL), a combination of deep
learning (DL) and reinforcement learning (RL), is one branch of the machine learning and has a considerable
prospect in resource scheduling of Cloud computing. This paper surveys the methods of resource
scheduling with focus on DRL-based scheduling approaches in Cloud computing, also reviews the
application of DRL as well as discusses challenges and future directions of DRL in scheduling of
Cloud computing.

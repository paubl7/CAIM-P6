Pathfinding in Euclidean space is a common problem faced in robotics and computer games. For long-distance
navigation on the surface of the earth or in outer space however, approximating the geometry as Euclidean
can be insufficient for real-world applications such as the navigation of spacecraft, aeroplanes,
drones and ships. This article describes an any-angle pathfinding algorithm for calculating the
shortest path between point pairs over the surface of a sphere. Introducing several novel adaptations,
it is shown that Anya as described by (Harabor & Grastien, 2013) for Euclidean space can be extended
to Spherical geometry. There, where the shortest-distance line between coordinates is defined
instead by a great-circle path, the optimal solution is typically a curved line in Euclidean space.
In addition the turning points for optimal paths in Spherical geometry are not necessarily corner
points as they are in Euclidean space, as will be shown, making further substantial adaptations
to Anya necessary. Spherical Anya returns the optimal path on the sphere, given these different
properties of world maps defined in Spherical geometry. It preserves all primary benefits of Anya
in Euclidean geometry, namely the Spherical Anya algorithm always returns an optimal path on a sphere
and does so entirely on-line, without any preprocessing or large memory overheads. Performance
benchmarks are provided for several game maps including Starcraft and Warcraft III as well as for
sea navigation on Earth using the NOAA bathymetric dataset. Always returning the shorter path compared
with the Euclidean approximation yielded by Anya, Spherical Anya is shown to be faster than Anya
for the majority of sea routes and slower for Game Maps and Random Maps.

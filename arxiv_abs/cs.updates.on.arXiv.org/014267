We propose an algorithm for the blind separation of single-channel audio signals. It is based on
a parametric model that describes the spectral properties of the sounds of musical instruments
independently of pitch. We develop a novel sparse pursuit algorithm that can match the discrete
frequency spectra from the recorded signal with the continuous spectra delivered by the model.
We first use this algorithm to convert an STFT spectrogram from the recording into a novel form of
log-frequency spectrogram whose resolution exceeds that of the mel spectrogram. We then make use
of the pitch-invariant properties of that representation in order to identify the sounds of the
instruments via the same sparse pursuit method. As the model parameters which characterize the
musical instruments are not known beforehand, we train a dictionary that contains them, using a
modified version of Adam. Applying the algorithm on various audio samples, we find that it is capable
of producing high-quality separation results when the model assumptions are satisfied and the
instruments are clearly distinguishable, but combinations of instruments with similar spectral
characteristics pose a conceptual difficulty. While a key feature of the model is that it explicitly
models inharmonicity, its presence can also still impede performance of the sparse pursuit algorithm.
In general, due to its pitch-invariance, our method is especially suitable for dealing with spectra
from acoustic instruments, requiring only a minimal number of hyperparameters to be preset. Additionally,
we demonstrate that the dictionary that is constructed for one recording can be applied to a different
recording with similar instruments without additional training.

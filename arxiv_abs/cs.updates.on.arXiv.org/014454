It is a long-term goal to transfer biological processing principles as well as the power of human
recognition into machine vision and engineering systems. One of such principles is visual attention,
a smart human concept which focuses processing on a part of a scene. In this contribution, we utilize
attention to improve the automatic detection of defect patterns for wafers within the domain of
semiconductor manufacturing. Previous works in the domain have often utilized classical machine
learning approaches such as KNNs, SVMs, or MLPs, while a few have already used modern approaches
like deep neural networks (DNNs). However, one problem in the domain is that the faults are often
very small and have to be detected within a larger size of the chip or even the wafer. Therefore, small
structures in the size of pixels have to be detected in a vast amount of image data. One interesting
principle of the human brain for solving this problem is visual attention. Hence, we employ here
a biologically plausible model of visual attention for automatic visual inspection. We propose
a hybrid system of visual attention and a deep neural network. As demonstrated, our system achieves
among other decisive advantages an improvement in accuracy from 81% to 92%, and an increase in accuracy
for detecting faults from 67% to 88%. Hence, the error rates are reduced from 19% to 8%, and notably
from 33% to 12% for detecting a fault in a chip. These results show that attention can greatly improve
the performance of visual inspection systems. Furthermore, we conduct a broad evaluation, identifying
specific advantages of the biological attention model in this application, and benchmarks standard
deep learning approaches as an alternative with and without attention. This work is an extended
arXiv version of the original conference article published in "IECON 2020", which has been extended
regarding visual attention.

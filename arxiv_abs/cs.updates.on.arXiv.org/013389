Agreement tests are a generalization of low degree tests that capture a local-to-global phenomenon,
which forms the combinatorial backbone of most PCP constructions. In an agreement test, a function
is given by an ensemble of local restrictions. The agreement test checks that the restrictions agree
when they overlap, and the main question is whether average agreement of the local pieces implies
that there exists a global function that agrees with most local restrictions. There are very few
structures that support agreement tests, essentially either coming from algebraic low degree
tests or from direct product tests (and recently also from high-dimensional expanders). In this
work, we prove a new agreement theorem which extends direct product tests to higher dimensions,
analogous to how low degree tests extend linearity testing. As a corollary of our main theorem, it
follows that an ensemble of small graphs on overlapping sets of vertices can be glued together to
one global graph assuming they agree with each other on average. We prove the agreement theorem by
(re)proving the agreement theorem for dimension 1, and then generalizing it to higher dimensions
(with the dimension 1 case being the direct product test, and dimension 2 being the graph case). A
key technical step in our proof is the reverse union bound, which allows us to treat dependent events
as if they are disjoint, and may be of independent interest. An added benefit of the reverse union
bound is that it can be used to show that the "majority decoded" function also serves as a global function
that explains the local consistency of the agreement theorem, a fact that was not known even in the
direct product setting (dimension 1) prior to our work.

[Context] Open Source Software (OSS) is nowadays used and integrated in most of the commercial products.
However, the selection of OSS projects for integration is not a simple process, mainly due to a of
lack of clear selection models and lack of information from the OSS portals. [Objective] We investigated
the current factors and measures that practitioners are currently considering when selecting
OSS, the source of information and portals that can be used to assess the factors, and the possibility
to automatically get this information with APIs. [Method] We elicited the factors and the measures
adopted to assess and compare OSS performing a survey among 23 experienced developers who often
integrate OSS in the software they develop. Moreover, we investigated the APIs of the portals adopted
to assess OSS extracting information for the most starred 100K projects in GitHub. [Result] We identified
a set consisting of 8 main factors and 74 sub-factors, together with 170 related metrics that companies
can use to select OSS to be integrated in their software projects. Unexpectedly, only a small part
of the factors can be evaluated automatically, and out of 170 metrics, only 40 are available, of which
only 22 returned information for all the 100K projects. [Conclusion.] OSS selection can be partially
automated, by extracting the information needed for the selection from portal APIs. OSS producers
can benefit from our results by checking if they are providing all the information commonly required
by potential adopters. Developers can benefit from our results, using the list of factors we selected
as a checklist during the selection of OSS, or using the APIs we developed to automatically extract
the data from OSS projects.

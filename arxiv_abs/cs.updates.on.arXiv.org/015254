Semi-implicit time-stepping schemes for atmosphere and ocean models require elliptic solvers
that work efficiently on modern supercomputers. This paper reports our study of the potential computational
savings when using mixed precision arithmetic in the elliptic solvers. The essential components
of a representative elliptic solver are run at precision levels as low as half (16 bits), and accompanied
with a detailed evaluation of the impact of reduced precision on the solver convergence and the solution
quality. A detailed inquiry into reduced precision requires a model configuration that is meaningful
but cheaper to run and easier to evaluate than full atmosphere/ocean models. This study is therefore
conducted in the context of a novel semi-implicit shallow-water model on the sphere, purposely
designed to mimic numerical intricacies of modern all-scale weather and climate (W&C) models with
the numerical stability independent on celerity of all wave motions. The governing algorithm of
the shallow-water model is based on the non-oscillatory MPDATA methods for geophysical flows,
whereas the resulting elliptic problem employs a strongly preconditioned non-symmetric Krylov-subspace
solver GCR, proven in advanced atmospheric applications. The classical longitude/latitude grid
is deliberately chosen to retain the stiffness of global W&C models posed in thin spherical shells
as well as to better understand the performance of reduced-precision arithmetic in the vicinity
of grid singularities. Precision reduction is done on a software level, using an emulator. The reduced-precision
experiments are conducted for established dynamical-core test-cases, like the Rossby-Haurwitz
wave number 4 and a zonal orographic flow. The study shows that selected key components of the elliptic
solver, most prominently the preconditioning, can be performed at the level of half precision.

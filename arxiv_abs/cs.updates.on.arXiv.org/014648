A recent strand of research in structural proof theory aims at exploring the notion of analytic calculi
(i.e. those calculi that support general and modular proof-strategies for cut elimination), and
at identifying classes of logics that can be captured in terms of these calculi. In this context,
Wansing introduced the notion of proper display calculi as one possible design framework for proof
calculi in which the analiticity desiderata are realized in a particularly transparent way. Recently,
the theory of properly displayable logics (i.e. those logics that can be equivalently presented
with some proper display calculus) has been developed in connection with generalized Sahlqvist
theory (aka unified correspondence). Specifically, properly displayable logics have been syntactically
characterized as those axiomatized by analytic inductive axioms, which can be equivalently and
algorithmically transformed into analytic structural rules so that the resulting proper display
calculi enjoy a set of basic properties: soundness, completeness, conservativity, cut elimination
and subformula property. In this context, the proof that the given calculus is complete w.r.t. the
original logic is usually carried out syntactically, i.e. by showing that a (cut free) derivation
exists of each given axiom of the logic in the basic system to which the analytic structural rules
algorithmically generated from the given axiom have been added. However, so far this proof strategy
for syntactic completeness has been implemented on a case-by-case base, and not in general. In this
paper, we address this gap by proving syntactic completeness for properly displayable logics in
any normal (distributive) lattice expansion signature. Specifically, we show that for every analytic
inductive axiom a cut free derivation can be effectively generated which has a specific shape, referred
to as pre-normal form.

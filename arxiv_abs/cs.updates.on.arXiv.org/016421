The diagnosis of prostate cancer faces a problem with overdiagnosis that leads to damaging side
effects due to unnecessary treatment. Research has shown that the use of multi-parametric magnetic
resonance images to conduct biopsies can drastically help to mitigate the overdiagnosis, thus
reducing the side effects on healthy patients. This study aims to investigate the use of deep learning
techniques to explore computer-aid diagnosis based on MRI as input. Several diagnosis problems
ranging from classification of lesions as being clinically significant or not to the detection
and segmentation of lesions are addressed with deep learning based approaches. This thesis tackled
two main problems regarding the diagnosis of prostate cancer. Firstly, XmasNet was used to conduct
two large experiments on the classification of lesions. Secondly, detection and segmentation
experiments were conducted, first on the prostate and afterward on the prostate cancer lesions.
The former experiments explored the lesions through a two-dimensional space, while the latter
explored models to work with three-dimensional inputs. For this task, the 3D models explored were
the 3D U-Net and a pretrained 3D ResNet-18. A rigorous analysis of all these problems was conducted
with a total of two networks, two cropping techniques, two resampling techniques, two crop sizes,
five input sizes and data augmentations experimented for lesion classification. While for segmentation
two models, two input sizes and data augmentations were experimented. However, while the binary
classification of the clinical significance of lesions and the detection and segmentation of the
prostate already achieve the desired results (0.870 AUC and 0.915 dice score respectively), the
classification of the PIRADS score and the segmentation of lesions still have a large margin to improve
(0.664 accuracy and 0.690 dice score respectively).

Synthetic medical image generation has a huge potential for improving healthcare through many
applications, from data augmentation for training machine learning systems to preserving patient
privacy. Conditional Adversarial Generative Networks (cGANs) use a conditioning factor to generate
images and have shown great success in recent years. Intuitively, the information in an image can
be divided into two parts: 1) content which is presented through the conditioning vector and 2) style
which is the undiscovered information missing from the conditioning vector. Current practices
in using cGANs for medical image generation, only use a single variable for image generation (i.e.,
content) and therefore, do not provide much flexibility nor control over the generated image. In
this work we propose a methodology to learn from the image itself, disentangled representations
of style and content, and use this information to impose control over the generation process. In
this framework, style is learned in a fully unsupervised manner, while content is learned through
both supervised learning (using the conditioning vector) and unsupervised learning (with the
inference mechanism). We undergo two novel regularization steps to ensure content-style disentanglement.
First, we minimize the shared information between content and style by introducing a novel application
of the gradient reverse layer (GRL); second, we introduce a self-supervised regularization method
to further separate information in the content and style variables. We show that in general, two
latent variable models achieve better performance and give more control over the generated image.
We also show that our proposed model (DRAI) achieves the best disentanglement score and has the best
overall performance.

The advancement in technology and accessibility of internet to each individual is revolutionizing
the real time information. The liberty to express your thoughts without passing through any credibility
check is leading to dissemination of fake content in the ecosystem. It can have disastrous effects
on both individuals and society as a whole. The amplification of fake news is becoming rampant in
India too. Debunked information often gets republished with a replacement description, claiming
it to depict some different incidence. To curb such fabricated stories, it is necessary to investigate
such deduplicates and false claims made in public. The majority of studies on automatic fact-checking
and fake news detection is restricted to English only. But for a country like India where only 10%
of the literate population speak English, role of regional languages in spreading falsity cannot
be undermined. In this paper, we introduce FactDRIL: the first large scale multilingual Fact-checking
Dataset for Regional Indian Languages. We collect an exhaustive dataset across 7 months covering
11 low-resource languages. Our propose dataset consists of 9,058 samples belonging to English,
5,155 samples to Hindi and remaining 8,222 samples are distributed across various regional languages,
i.e. Bangla, Marathi, Malayalam, Telugu, Tamil, Oriya, Assamese, Punjabi, Urdu, Sinhala and Burmese.
We also present the detailed characterization of three M's (multi-lingual, multi-media, multi-domain)
in the FactDRIL accompanied with the complete list of other varied attributes making it a unique
dataset to study. Lastly, we present some potential use cases of the dataset. We expect this dataset
will be a valuable resource and serve as a starting point to fight proliferation of fake news in low
resource languages.

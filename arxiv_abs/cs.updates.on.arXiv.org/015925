The new generation of cloud data warehouses (CDWs) brings large amounts of data and compute power
closer to users in enterprises. The ability to directly access the warehouse data, interactively
analyze and explore it at scale can empower users to improve their decision making cycles. However,
existing tools for analyzing data in CDWs are either limited in ad-hoc transformations or difficult
to use for business users, the largest user segment in enterprises. Here we introduce Sigma Worksheet,
a new interactive system that enables users to easily perform ad-hoc visual analysis of data in CDWs
at scale. For this, Sigma Worksheet provides an accessible spreadsheet-like interface for data
analysis through direct manipulation. Sigma Worksheet dynamically constructs matching SQL queries
from user interactions on this familiar interface, building on the versatility and expressivity
of SQL. Sigma Worksheet executes constructed queries directly on CDWs, leveraging the superior
characteristics of the new generation CDWs, including scalability. To evaluate Sigma Worksheet,
we first demonstrate its expressivity through two real life use cases, cohort analysis and sessionization.
We then measure the performance of the Worksheet generated queries with a set of experiments using
the TPC-H benchmark. Results show the performance of our compiled SQL queries is comparable to that
of the reference queries of the benchmark. Finally, to assess the usefulness of Sigma Worksheet
in deployment, we elicit feedback through a 100-person survey followed by a semi-structured interview
study with 70 participants. We find that Sigma Worksheet is easier to use and learn, improving the
productivity of users. Our findings also suggest Sigma Worksheet can further improve user experience
by providing guidance to users at various steps of data analysis.

We consider the uncapacitated three-level lot-sizing and replenishment problem with a distribution
structure. In this NP-hard problem, a single production plant sends the produced items to replenish
warehouses from where they are dispatched to the retailers in order to satisfy their demands over
a finite planning horizon. The goal of the problem is to determine an integrated production and distribution
plan minimizing the total costs, which comprehends fixed production and transportation setup
as well as variable inventory holding costs. We describe new valid inequalities both in the space
of a standard mixed integer programming (MIP) formulation and in that of a new alternative extended
MIP formulation. We show that using such extended formulation, valid inequalities having similar
structures to those in the standard one allow achieving tighter linear relaxation bounds. Furthermore,
we propose a preprocessing approach to reduce the size of a multi-commodity MIP formulation and
a multi-start randomized bottom-up dynamic programming based heuristic. Computational experiments
indicate that the use of the valid inequalities in a branch-and-cut approach significantly increase
the ability of a MIP solver to solve instances to optimality. Additionally, the valid inequalities
for the extended formulation outperform those for the standard one in terms of number of solved instances,
running time and number of enumerated nodes. Moreover, the proposed heuristic is able to generate
solutions with considerably low optimality gaps within very short computational times even for
large instances. Combining the preprocessing approach with the heuristic, one can achieve an increase
in the number of solutions solved to optimality within the time limit together with significant
reductions on the average times for solving them.

A unified treatment for fast and spectrally accurate evaluation of electrostatic potentials subject
to periodic boundary conditions in any or none of the three spatial dimensions is presented. Ewald
decomposition is used to split the problem into a real-space and a Fourier-space part, and the FFT-based
Spectral Ewald (SE) method is used to accelerate the computation of the latter. A key component in
the unified treatment is an FFT-based solution technique for the free-space Poisson problem in
three, two or one dimensions, depending on the number of non-periodic directions. The computational
cost is furthermore reduced by employing an adaptive FFT for the doubly and singly periodic cases,
allowing for different local upsampling factors. The SE method will always be most efficient for
the triply periodic case as the cost of computing FFTs will then be the smallest, whereas the computational
cost of the rest of the algorithm is essentially independent of periodicity. We show that the cost
of removing periodic boundary conditions from one or two directions out of three will only moderately
increase the total runtime. Our comparisons also show that the computational cost of the SE method
in the free-space case is around four times that of the triply periodic case. The Gaussian window
function previously used in the SE method, is here compared to a piecewise polynomial approximation
of the Kaiser-Bessel window function. With a carefully tuned shape parameter that is selected based
on an error estimate for this new window function, runtimes for the SE method can be further reduced.
Furthermore, we consider different methods for computing the force, and compare the runtime of
the SE method with that of the Fast Multipole Method.

In recent years, several online platforms have seen a rapid increase in the number of review systems
that request users to provide aspect-level feedback. Document-level Multi-aspect Sentiment
Classification (DMSC), where the goal is to predict the ratings/sentiment from a review at an individual
aspect level, has become a challenging and imminent problem. To tackle this challenge, we propose
a deliberate self-attention-based deep neural network model, namely FEDAR, for the DMSC problem,
which can achieve competitive performance while also being able to interpret the predictions made.
FEDAR is equipped with a highway word embedding layer to transfer knowledge from pre-trained word
embeddings, an RNN encoder layer with output features enriched by pooling and factorization techniques,
and a deliberate self-attention layer. In addition, we also propose an Attention-driven Keywords
Ranking (AKR) method, which can automatically discover aspect keywords and aspect-level opinion
keywords from the review corpus based on the attention weights. These keywords are significant
for rating predictions by FEDAR. Since crowdsourcing annotation can be an alternate way to recover
missing ratings of reviews, we propose a LEcture-AuDience (LEAD) strategy to estimate model uncertainty
in the context of multi-task learning, so that valuable human resources can focus on the most uncertain
predictions. Our extensive set of experiments on five different open-domain DMSC datasets demonstrate
the superiority of the proposed FEDAR and LEAD models. We further introduce two new DMSC datasets
in the healthcare domain and benchmark different baseline models and our models on them. Attention
weights visualization results and visualization of aspect and opinion keywords demonstrate the
interpretability of our model and the effectiveness of our AKR method.

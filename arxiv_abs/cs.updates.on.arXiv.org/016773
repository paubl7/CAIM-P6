Data assimilation (DA) is widely used to combine physical knowledge and observations. It is nowadays
commonly used in geosciences to perform parametric calibration. In a context of climate change,
old calibrations can not necessarily be used for new scenarios. This raises the question of DA computational
cost, as costly physics-based numerical models need to be reanalyzed. Reduction and metamodelling
represent therefore interesting perspectives, for example proposed in recent contributions
as hybridization between ensemble and variational methods, to combine their advantages (efficiency,
non-linear framework). They are however often based on Monte Carlo (MC) type sampling, which often
requires considerable increase of the ensemble size for better efficiency, therefore representing
a computational burden in ensemble-based methods as well. To address these issues, two methods
to replace the complex model by a surrogate are proposed and confronted : (i) PODEn3DVAR directly
inspired from PODEn4DVAR, relies on an ensemble-based joint parameter-state Proper Orthogonal
Decomposition (POD), which provides a linear metamodel ; (ii) POD-PCE-3DVAR, where the model states
are POD reduced then learned using Polynomial Chaos Expansion (PCE), resulting in a non-linear
metamodel. Both metamodels allow to write an approximate cost function whose minimum can be analytically
computed, or deduced by a gradient descent at negligible cost. Furthermore, adapted metamodelling
error covariance matrix is given for POD-PCE-3DVAR, allowing to substantially improve the metamodel-based
DA analysis. Proposed methods are confronted on a twin experiment, and compared to classical 3DVAR
on a measurement-based problem. Results are promising, in particular superior with POD-PCE-3DVAR,
showing good convergence to classical 3DVAR and robustness to noise.

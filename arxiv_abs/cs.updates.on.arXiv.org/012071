The ODE method has been a workhorse for algorithm design and analysis since the introduction of the
stochastic approximation. It is now understood that convergence theory amounts to establishing
robustness of Euler approximations for ODEs, while theory of rates of convergence requires finer
probabilistic analysis. This paper sets out to extend this theory to quasi-stochastic approximation,
based on algorithms in which the "noise" is based on deterministic signals. The main results are
obtained under minimal assumptions: the usual Lipschitz conditions for ODE vector fields, and
it is assumed that there is a well defined linearization near the optimal parameter $\theta^*$,
with Hurwitz linearization matrix. The main contributions are as follows: (i) If the algorithm
gain is $a_t=g/(1+t)^\rho$ with $g>0$ and $\rho\in(0,1)$, then the rate of convergence of the algorithm
is $1/t^\rho$. There is also a well defined "finite-$t$" approximation: \[ a_t^{-1}\{\ODEstate_t-\theta^*\}=\bar{Y}+\XiI_t+o(1)
\] where $\bar{Y}\in\Re^d$ is a vector identified in the paper, and $\{\XiI_t\}$ is bounded with
zero temporal mean. (ii) With gain $a_t = g/(1+t)$ the results are not as sharp: the rate of convergence
$1/t$ holds only if $I + g A^*$ is Hurwitz. (iii) Based on the Ruppert-Polyak averaging technique
of stochastic approximation, one would expect that a convergence rate of $1/t$ can be obtained by
averaging: \[ \ODEstate^{\text{RP}}_T=\frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^T \ODEstate_t\,dt \] where the
estimates $\{\ODEstate_t\}$ are obtained using the gain in (i). The preceding sharp bounds imply
that averaging results in $1/t$ convergence rate if and only if $\bar{Y}=\Zero$. This condition
holds if the noise is additive, but appears to fail in general. (iv) The theory is illustrated with
applications to gradient-free optimization and policy gradient algorithms for reinforcement
learning.

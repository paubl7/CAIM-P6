Various German and European research projects created several isolated solutions for intelligent
transportation systems (ITS) infrastructure. As a matter of fact, a lot of those solutions are temporary.
The backend architecture provided by those systems is mostly focused on only supporting test and
evaluation of topics in the context of vehicular based application and communication. There have
been a couple of research projects, which have evaluated the different communication paths between
ITS roadside or central stations and vehicle stations. The current approach of the research community
is to combine multiple ways of communication to provide the greatest benefit. Two of the most promising
technologies are cellular communication and Car-to-Car communication. As there have already
been research projects which evaluate the possibilities of one of those communication paths, few
research projects have evaluated how those paths could complement each other. The structure of
the Car2X Systems Network will be based on the Internet, in which different and independent participants
are working equally together over standardized interfaces and protocols. However, the Car2X Systems
Network needs some special solutions, as the concepts of the Internet are not entirely applicable
to the requirements of the ITS world. Especially the strict security and privacy considerations
of ITS environments are not or only insufficiently addressed in current state-of-the-art internet
services. Furthermore, network requirements like Quality of Service needs also to be considered.
Thus, the Car2X Systems Network aims to provide open, standardized, secure and interchangeable
interfaces for each possible participant of the ITS environment.

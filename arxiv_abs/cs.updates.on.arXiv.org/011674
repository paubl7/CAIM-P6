Git metadata contains rich information for developers to understand the overall context of a large
software development project. Thus it can help new developers, managers, and testers understand
the history of development without needing to dig into a large pile of unfamiliar source code. However,
the current tools for Git visualization are not adequate to analyze and explore the metadata: They
focus mainly on improving the usability of Git commands instead of on helping users understand the
development history. Furthermore, they do not scale for large and complex Git commit graphs, which
can play an important role in understanding the overall development history. In this paper, we present
Githru, an interactive visual analytics system that enables developers to effectively understand
the context of development history through the interactive exploration of Git metadata. We design
an interactive visual encoding idiom to represent a large Git graph in a scalable manner while preserving
the topological structures in the Git graph. To enable scalable exploration of a large Git commit
graph, we propose novel techniques (graph reconstruction, clustering, and Context-Preserving
Squash Merge (CSM) methods) to abstract a large-scale Git commit graph. Based on these Git commit
graph abstraction techniques, Githru provides an interactive summary view to help users gain an
overview of the development history and a comparison view in which users can compare different clusters
of commits. The efficacy of Githru has been demonstrated by case studies with domain experts using
real-world, in-house datasets from a large software development team at a major international
IT company. A controlled user study with 12 developers comparing Githru to previous tools also confirms
the effectiveness of Githru in terms of task completion time.

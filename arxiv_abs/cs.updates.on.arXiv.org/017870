While data sharing is crucial for knowledge development, privacy concerns and strict regulation
(e.g., European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)) unfortunately limits its full effectiveness.
Synthetic tabular data emerges as an alternative to enable data sharing while fulfilling regulatory
and privacy constraints. The state-of-the-art tabular data synthesizers draw methodologies
from Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN). In this thesis, we develop CTAB-GAN, a novel conditional
table GAN architecture that can effectively model diverse data types with complex distributions.
CTAB-GAN is extensively evaluated with the state of the art GANs that generate synthetic tables,
in terms of data similarity and analysis utility. The results on five datasets show that the synthetic
data of CTAB-GAN remarkably resembles the real data for all three types of variables and results
in higher accuracy for five machine learning algorithms, by up to 17%. Additionally, to ensure greater
security for training tabular GANs against malicious privacy attacks, differential privacy (DP)
is studied and used to train CTAB-GAN with strict privacy guarantees. DP-CTAB-GAN is rigorously
evaluated using state-of-the-art DP-tabular GANs in terms of data utility and privacy robustness
against membership and attribute inference attacks. Our results on three datasets indicate that
strict theoretical differential privacy guarantees come only after severely affecting data utility.
However, it is shown empirically that these guarantees help provide a stronger defence against
privacy attacks. Overall, it is found that DP-CTABGAN is capable of being robust to privacy attacks
while maintaining the highest data utility as compared to prior work, by up to 18% in terms of the average
precision score.

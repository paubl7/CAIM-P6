The H-frame (also known as H-Bot) architecture is a simple and elegant two-axis parallel positioning
system used to construct the XY stage of 3D printers. It holds potential for high speed and excellent
dynamic performance due to the use of frame-mounted motors that reduce the moving mass of the printer
while allowing for the use of (heavy) higher torque motors. However, the H-frame's dynamic accuracy
is limited during high-acceleration and high-speed motion due to racking -- i.e., parasitic torsional
motions of the printer's gantry due to a force couple. Mechanical solutions to the racking problem
are either costly or detract from the simplicity of the H-frame. In this paper, we introduce a feedforward
software compensation algorithm, based on the filtered B-splines (FBS) method, that rectifies
errors due to racking. The FBS approach expresses the motion command to the machine as a linear combination
of B-splines. The B-splines are filtered through an identified model of the machine dynamics and
the control points of the B-spline based motion command are optimized such that the tracking error
is minimized. To compensate racking using the FBS algorithm, an accurate frequency response function
of the racking motion is obtained and coupled to the H-frame's x- and y-axis dynamics with a kinematic
model. The result is a coupled linear parameter varying model of the H-frame that is utilized in the
FBS framework to compensate racking. An approximation of the proposed racking compensation algorithm,
that decouples the x- and y-axis compensation, is developed to significantly improve its computational
efficiency with almost no loss of compensation accuracy. Experiments on an H-frame 3D printer demonstrate
a 43 percent improvement in the shape accuracy of a printed part using the proposed algorithm compared
to the standard FBS approach without racking compensation.

The exponential growth of distributed energy resources is enabling the transformation of traditional
consumers in the smart grid into prosumers. Such transition presents a promising opportunity for
sustainable energy trading. Yet, the integration of prosumers in the energy market imposes new
considerations in designing unified and sustainable frameworks for efficient use of the power
and communication infrastructure. Furthermore, several issues need to be tackled to adequately
promote the adoption of decentralized renewable-oriented systems, such as communication overhead,
data privacy, scalability, and sustainability. In this article, we present the different aspects
and challenges to be addressed for building efficient energy trading markets in relation to communication
and smart decision-making. Accordingly, we propose a multi-level pro-decision framework for
prosumer communities to achieve collective goals. Since the individual decisions of prosumers
are mainly driven by individual self-sufficiency goals, the framework prioritizes the individual
prosumers' decisions and relies on 5G wireless network for fast coordination among community members.
In fact, each prosumer predicts energy production and consumption to make proactive trading decisions
as a response to collective-level requests. Moreover, the collaboration of the community is further
extended by including the collaborative training of prediction models using Federated Learning,
assisted by edge servers and prosumer home-area equipment. In addition to preserving prosumers'
privacy, we show through evaluations that training prediction models using Federated Learning
yields high accuracy for different energy resources while reducing the communication overhead.

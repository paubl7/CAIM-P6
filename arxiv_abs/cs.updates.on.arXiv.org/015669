Peripheral Arterial Disease (PAD) is a common form of arterial occlusive disease that is challenging
to evaluate at the point-of-care. Hand-held dopplers are the most ubiquitous device used to evaluate
circulation and allows providers to audibly "listen" to the blood flow. Providers use the audible
feedback to subjectively assess whether the sound characteristics are consistent with Monophasic,
Biphasic, or Triphasic waveforms. Subjective assessment of doppler sounds raises suspicion of
PAD and leads to further testing, often delaying definitive treatment. Misdiagnoses are also possible
with subjective interpretation of doppler waveforms. This paper presents a Deep Learning system
that has the ability to predict waveform phasicity through analysis of hand-held doppler sounds.
We collected 268 four-second recordings on an iPhone taken during a formal vascular lab study in
patients with cardiovascular disease. Our end-to-end system works by converting input sound into
a spectrogram which visually represents frequency changes in temporal patterns. This conversion
enables visual differentiation between the phasicity classes. With these changes present, a custom
trained Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used for prediction through learned feature extraction.
The performance of the model was evaluated via calculation of the F1 score and accuracy metrics.
The system received an F1 score of 90.57% and an accuracy of 96.23%. Our Deep Learning system is not
computationally expensive and has the ability for integration within several applications. When
used in a clinic, this system has the capability of preventing misdiagnosis and gives practitioners
a second opinion that can be useful in the evaluation of PAD.

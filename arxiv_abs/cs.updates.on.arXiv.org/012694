By virtue of technology and benefit advantages, cloud computing has increasingly attracted a large
number of potential cloud consumers (PCC) plan to migrate traditional business to the cloud service.
However, trust has become one of the most challenging issues that prevent the PCC from adopting cloud
services, especially in trustworthy cloud service selection. In addition, due to the diversity
and dynamic of quality of service (QoS) in cloud environment, the existing trust assessment methods
based on the single constant value of QoS attribute and the subjective weight assignment are not
good enough to provides an effective solution for PCCs to identify and select a trustworthy cloud
service among a wide range of functionally-equivalent cloud service providers (CSP). To address
the challenge, a novel assessment and selection framework for trustworthy cloud service, FASTCloud,
is proposed in this study. This framework facilitate PCCs to select a trustworthy cloud service
based on their actual QoS requirements. In order to accurately and efficiently assess the trust
level of cloud services, a QoS-based trust assessment model is proposed. This model represents
a trust level assessment method based on the interval multiple attributes with a objective weight
assignment method based on the deviation maximization to adaptively determine the trust level
of different cloud services provisioned by candidate CSPs. The advantage of proposed trust level
assessment method in time complexity is demonstrated by the performance analysis and comparison.The
experimental result of a case study with an open source dataset shows that the trust model is efficient
in cloud service trust assessment and the FASTCloud can effectively help PCCs select a trustworthy
cloud service.

While analytical solutions of critical (phase) transitions in physical systems are abundant for
simple nonlinear systems, such analysis remains intractable for real-life dynamical systems.
A key example of such a physical system is thermoacoustic instability in combustion, where prediction
or early detection of an onset of instability is a hard technical challenge, which needs to be addressed
to build safer and more energy-efficient gas turbine engines powering aerospace and energy industries.
The instabilities arising in combustion chambers of engines are mathematically too complex to
model. To address this issue in a data-driven manner instead, we propose a novel deep learning architecture
called 3D convolutional selective autoencoder (3D-CSAE) to detect the evolution of self-excited
oscillations using spatiotemporal data, i.e., hi-speed videos taken from a swirl-stabilized
combustor (laboratory surrogate of gas turbine engine combustor). 3D-CSAE consists of filters
to learn, in a hierarchical fashion, the complex visual and dynamic features related to combustion
instability. We train the 3D-CSAE on frames of videos obtained from a limited set of operating conditions.
We select the 3D-CSAE hyper-parameters that are effective for characterizing hierarchical and
multiscale instability structure evolution by utilizing the dynamic information available in
the video. The proposed model clearly shows performance improvement in detecting the precursors
of instability. The machine learning-driven results are verified with physics-based off-line
measures. Advanced active control mechanisms can directly leverage the proposed online detection
capability of 3D-CSAE to mitigate the adverse effects of combustion instabilities on the engine
operating under various stringent requirements and conditions.

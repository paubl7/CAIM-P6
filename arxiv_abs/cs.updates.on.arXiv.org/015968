Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) is a blood cell cancer characterized by numerous immature lymphocytes.
Even though automation in ALL prognosis is an essential aspect of cancer diagnosis, it is challenging
due to the morphological correlation between malignant and normal cells. The traditional ALL classification
strategy demands experienced pathologists to carefully read the cell images, which is arduous,
time-consuming, and often suffers inter-observer variations. This article has automated the
ALL detection task from microscopic cell images, employing deep Convolutional Neural Networks
(CNNs). We explore the weighted ensemble of different deep CNNs to recommend a better ALL cell classifier.
The weights for the ensemble candidate models are estimated from their corresponding metrics,
such as accuracy, F1-score, AUC, and kappa values. Various data augmentations and pre-processing
are incorporated for achieving a better generalization of the network. We utilize the publicly
available C-NMC-2019 ALL dataset to conduct all the comprehensive experiments. Our proposed weighted
ensemble model, using the kappa values of the ensemble candidates as their weights, has outputted
a weighted F1-score of 88.6 %, a balanced accuracy of 86.2 %, and an AUC of 0.941 in the preliminary
test set. The qualitative results displaying the gradient class activation maps confirm that the
introduced model has a concentrated learned region. In contrast, the ensemble candidate models,
such as Xception, VGG-16, DenseNet-121, MobileNet, and InceptionResNet-V2, separately produce
coarse and scatter learned areas for most example cases. Since the proposed kappa value-based weighted
ensemble yields a better result for the aimed task in this article, it can experiment in other domains
of medical diagnostic applications.

The nonlocal models of peridynamics have successfully predicted fractures and deformations for
a variety of materials. In contrast to local mechanics, peridynamic boundary conditions must be
defined on a finite volume region outside the body. Therefore, theoretical and numerical challenges
arise in order to properly formulate Dirichlet-type nonlocal boundary conditions, while connecting
them to the local counterparts. While a careless imposition of local boundary conditions leads
to a smaller effective material stiffness close to the boundary and an artificial softening of the
material, several strategies were proposed to avoid this unphysical surface effect. In this work,
we study convergence of solutions to nonlocal state-based linear elastic model to their local counterparts
as the interaction horizon vanishes, under different formulations and smoothness assumptions
for nonlocal Dirichlet-type boundary conditions. Our results provide explicit rates of convergence
that are sensitive to the compatibility of the nonlocal boundary data and the extension of the solution
for the local model. In particular, under appropriate assumptions, constant extensions yield
$\frac{1}{2}$ order convergence rates and linear extensions yield $\frac{3}{2}$ order convergence
rates. With smooth extensions, these rates are improved to quadratic convergence. We illustrate
the theory for any dimension $d\geq 2$ and numerically verify the convergence rates with a number
of two dimensional benchmarks, including linear patch tests, manufactured solutions, and domains
with curvilinear surfaces. Numerical results show a first order convergence for constant extensions
and second order convergence for linear extensions, which suggests a possible room of improvement
in the future convergence analysis.

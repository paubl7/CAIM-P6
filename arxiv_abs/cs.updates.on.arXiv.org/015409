Face recognition technology related to recognizing identities is widely adopted in intelligence
gathering, law enforcement, surveillance, and consumer applications. Recently, this technology
has been ported to smartphones and body-worn cameras (BWC). Face recognition technology in body-worn
cameras is used for surveillance, situational awareness, and keeping the officer safe. Only a handful
of academic studies exist in face recognition using the body-worn camera. A recent study has assembled
BWCFace facial image dataset acquired using a body-worn camera and evaluated the ResNet-50 model
for face identification. However, for real-time inference in resource constraint body-worn cameras
and privacy concerns involving facial images, on-device face recognition is required. To this
end, this study evaluates lightweight MobileNet-V2, EfficientNet-B0, LightCNN-9 and LightCNN-29
models for face identification using body-worn camera. Experiments are performed on a publicly
available BWCface dataset. The real-time inference is evaluated on three mobile devices. The comparative
analysis is done with heavy-weight VGG-16 and ResNet-50 models along with six hand-crafted features
to evaluate the trade-off between the performance and model size. Experimental results suggest
the difference in maximum rank-1 accuracy of lightweight LightCNN-29 over best-performing ResNet-50
is \textbf{1.85\%} and the reduction in model parameters is \textbf{23.49M}. Most of the deep models
obtained similar performances at rank-5 and rank-10. The inference time of LightCNNs is 2.1x faster
than other models on mobile devices. The least performance difference of \textbf{14\%} is noted
between LightCNN-29 and Local Phase Quantization (LPQ) descriptor at rank-1. In most of the experimental
settings, lightweight LightCNN models offered the best trade-off between accuracy and the model
size in comparison to most of the models.

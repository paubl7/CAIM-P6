COVID-19 is a highly contagious respiratory infection that has affected a large population across
the world and continues with its devastating consequences. It is imperative to detect COVID-19
at the earliest to limit the span of infection. In this work, a new classification technique CB-STM-RENet
based on deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Channel Boosting is developed for the detection
of COVID-19 from chest X-Rays. In this connection, to learn the COVID-19 specific radiographic
patterns, a new convolution block based on split-transform-merge (STM) is developed. This new
block systematically incorporates region and edge base operations at each branch to capture the
diverse set of features at various levels, especially those related to region homogeneity, textural
variations, and boundaries of the infected region. We further enhanced the learning and discrimination
capability of the proposed CNN architecture by exploiting the Channel Boosting idea that concatenates
the auxiliary channels along with the original channels. The auxiliary channels are generated
by employing Transfer Learning-based domain adaption of the pre-trained CNN architectures. The
effectiveness of the proposed technique CB-STM-RENet is evaluated on three different datasets
containing CoV-Healthy-6k, CoV-NonCoV-10k, and CoV-NonCoV-15k Chest X-Ray images, respectively.
The performance comparison of the proposed deep CB-STM-RENet with the existing techniques exhibits
high classification performance both in discriminating COVID-19 chest infections from healthy,
as well as, other types of chest infections. CB-STM-RENet provides the highest performance on all
these three datasets; especially on the stringent CoV-NonCoV-15k dataset. The good detection
rate (97%), and high precision (93%) of the proposed technique suggest that it can be adapted for
the diagnosis of COVID-19 infected patients.

The article presents the possibilities of using game simulator Sotware Inc in the training of future
software engineer in higher education. Attention is drawn to some specific settings that need to
be taken into account when training in the course of training future software engineers. More and
more educational institutions are introducing new teaching methods, which result in the use of
engineering students, in particular, future software engineers, to deal with real professional
situations in the learning process. The use of modern ICT, including game simulators, in the educational
process, allows to improve the quality of educational material and to enhance the educational effects
from the use of innovative pedagogical programs and methods, as it gives teachers additional opportunities
for constructing individual educational trajectories of students. The use of ICT allows for a differentiated
approach to students with different levels of readiness to study. A feature of any software engineer
is the need to understand the related subject area for which the software is being developed. An important
condition for the preparation of a highly qualified specialist is the independent fulfillment
by the student of scientific research, the generation, and implementation of his idea into a finished
commercial product. In the process of research, students gain knowledge, skills of the future IT
specialist and competences of the legal protection of the results of intellectual activity, technological
audit, marketing, product realization in the market of innovations. Note that when the real-world
practice is impossible for students, game simulators that simulate real software development
processes are an alternative.

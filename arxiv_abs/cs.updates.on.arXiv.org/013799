Green communications have always been a target for the information industry to alleviate energy
overhead and reduce fossil fuel usage. In current 5G and future 6G era, there is no doubt that the volume
of network infrastructure and the number of connected terminals will keep exponentially increasing,
which results in the surging energy cost. It becomes growing important and urgent to drive the development
of green communications. However, 6G will inevitably have increasingly stringent and diversified
requirements for Quality of Service (QoS), security, flexibility, and even intelligence, all
of which challenge the improvement of energy efficiency. Moreover, the dynamic energy harvesting
process, which will be adopted widely in 6G, further complicates the power control and network management.
To address these challenges and reduce human intervene, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been
widely recognized and acknowledged as the only solution. Academia and industry have conducted
extensive research to alleviate energy demand, improve energy efficiency, and manage energy harvesting
in various communication scenarios. In this paper, we present the main considerations for green
communications and survey the related research on AI-based green communications. We focus on how
AI techniques are adopted to manage the network and improve energy harvesting toward the green era.
We analyze how state-of-the-art Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques can cooperate
with conventional AI methods and mathematical models to reduce the algorithm complexity and optimize
the accuracy rate to accelerate the applications in 6G. Finally, we discuss the existing problems
and envision the challenges for these emerging techniques in 6G.

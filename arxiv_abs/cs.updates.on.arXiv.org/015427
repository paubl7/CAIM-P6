The betweenness centrality of a graph vertex measures how often this vertex is visited on shortest
paths between other vertices of the graph. In the analysis of many real-world graphs or networks,
betweenness centrality of a vertex is used as an indicator for its relative importance in the network.
In particular, it is among the most popular tools in social network analysis. In recent years, a growing
number of real-world networks is modeled as temporal graphs, where we have a fixed set of vertices
and there is a finite discrete set of time steps and every edge might be present only at some time steps.
While shortest paths are straightforward to define in static graphs, temporal paths can be considered
"optimal" with respect to many different criteria, including length, arrival time, and overall
travel time (shortest, foremost, and fastest paths). This leads to different concepts of temporal
betweenness centrality and we provide a systematic study of temporal betweenness variants based
on various concepts of optimal temporal paths. Computing the betweenness centrality for vertices
in a graph is closely related to counting the number of optimal paths between vertex pairs. We show
that counting foremost and fastest paths is computationally intractable (#P-hard) and hence the
computation of the corresponding temporal betweenness values is intractable as well. For shortest
paths and two selected special cases of foremost paths, we devise polynomial-time algorithms for
temporal betweenness computation. Moreover, we also explore the distinction between strict (ascending
time labels) and non-strict (non-descending time labels) time labels in temporal paths. In our
experiments with established real-world temporal networks, we demonstrate the practical effectiveness
of our algorithms, compare the various betweenness concepts, and derive recommendations on their
practical use.

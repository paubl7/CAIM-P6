The non-linear binary Kerdock codes are known to be Gray images of certain extended cyclic codes
of length $N = 2^m$ over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. We show that exponentiating these $\mathbb{Z}_4$-valued
codewords by $\imath \triangleq \sqrt{-1}$ produces stabilizer states, that are quantum states
obtained using only Clifford unitaries. These states are also the common eigenvectors of commuting
Hermitian matrices forming maximal commutative subgroups (MCS) of the Pauli group. We use this
quantum description to simplify the derivation of the classical weight distribution of Kerdock
codes. Next, we organize the stabilizer states to form $N+1$ mutually unbiased bases and prove that
automorphisms of the Kerdock code permute their corresponding MCS, thereby forming a subgroup
of the Clifford group. When represented as symplectic matrices, this subgroup is isomorphic to
the projective special linear group PSL($2,N$). We show that this automorphism group acts transitively
on the Pauli matrices, which implies that the ensemble is Pauli mixing and hence forms a unitary $2$-design.
The Kerdock design described here was originally discovered by Cleve et al. (arXiv:1501.04592),
but the connection to classical codes is new which simplifies its description and translation to
circuits significantly. Sampling from the design is straightforward, the translation to circuits
uses only Clifford gates, and the process does not require ancillary qubits. Finally, we also develop
algorithms for optimizing the synthesis of unitary $2$-designs on encoded qubits, i.e., to construct
logical unitary $2$-designs. Software implementations are available at https://github.com/nrenga/symplectic-arxiv18a,
which we use to provide empirical gate complexities for up to $16$ qubits.

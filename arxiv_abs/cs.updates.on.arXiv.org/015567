Mental fatigue increases the risk of operator error in language comprehension tasks. In order to
prevent operator performance degradation, we used EEG signals to assess the mental fatigue of operators
in human-computer systems. This study presents an experimental design for fatigue detection in
language comprehension tasks. We obtained EEG signals from a 14-channel wireless EEG detector
in 15 healthy participants. Each participant was given a cognitive test of a language comprehension
task, in the form of multiple choice questions, in which pronoun references were selected between
nominal and surrogate sentences. In this paper, the 2400 EEG fragments collected are divided into
three data sets according to different utilization rates, namely 1200s data set with 50% utilization
rate, 1500s data set with 62.5% utilization rate, and 1800s data set with 75% utilization rate. In
the aspect of feature extraction, different EEG features were extracted, including time domain
features, frequency domain features and entropy features, and the effects of different features
and feature combinations on classification accuracy were explored. In terms of classification,
we introduced the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) method as the preferred method, It was compared
with Least Squares Support Vector Machines(LSSVM),Support Vector Machines(SVM),Logistic Regression
(LR), Random Forest(RF), Naive Bayes (NB), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) and Decision Tree(DT).According
to the results, the classification accuracy of convolutional neural network (CNN) is higher than
that of other classification methods. The classification results show that the classification
accuracy of 1200S dataset is higher than the other two datasets. The combination of Frequency and
entropy feature and CNN has the highest classification accuracy, which is 85.34%.

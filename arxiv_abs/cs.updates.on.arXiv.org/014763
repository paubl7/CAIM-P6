"The output of a computerised system can only be as accurate as the information entered into it."
This rather trivial statement is the basis behind one of the driving concepts in biometric recognition:
biometric quality. Quality is nowadays widely regarded as the number one factor responsible for
the good or bad performance of automated biometric systems. It refers to the ability of a biometric
sample to be used for recognition purposes and produce consistent, accurate, and reliable results.
Such a subjective term is objectively estimated by the so-called biometric quality metrics. These
algorithms play nowadays a pivotal role in the correct functioning of systems, providing feedback
to the users and working as invaluable audit tools. In spite of their unanimously accepted relevance,
some of the most used and deployed biometric characteristics are lacking behind in the development
of these methods. This is the case of face recognition. After a gentle introduction to the general
topic of biometric quality and a review of past efforts in face quality metrics, in the present work,
we address the need for better face quality metrics by developing FaceQnet. FaceQnet is a novel open-source
face quality assessment tool, inspired and powered by deep learning technology, which assigns
a scalar quality measure to facial images, as prediction of their recognition accuracy. Two versions
of FaceQnet have been thoroughly evaluated both in this work and also independently by NIST, showing
the soundness of the approach and its competitiveness with respect to current state-of-the-art
metrics. Even though our work is presented here particularly in the framework of face biometrics,
the proposed methodology for building a fully automated quality metric can be very useful and easily
adapted to other artificial intelligence tasks.

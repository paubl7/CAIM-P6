With the proliferation of Android malware, the demand for an effective and efficient malware detection
system is on the rise. The existing device-end learning based solutions tend to extract limited
syntax features (e.g., permissions and API calls) to meet a certain time constraint of mobile devices.
However, syntax features lack the semantics which can represent the potential malicious behaviors
and further result in more robust model with high accuracy for malware detection. In this paper,
we propose an efficient Android malware detection system, named SeqMobile, which adopts behavior-based
sequence features and leverages customized deep neural networks on mobile devices instead of the
server. Different from the traditional sequence-based approaches on server, to meet the performance
demand, SeqMobile accepts three effective performance optimization methods to reduce the time
cost. To evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of our system, we conduct experiments from the
following aspects 1) the detection accuracy of different recurrent neural networks; 2) the feature
extraction performance on different mobile devices, 3) the detection accuracy and prediction
time cost of different sequence lengths. The results unveil that SeqMobile can effectively detect
malware with high accuracy. Moreover, our performance optimization methods have proven to improve
the performance of training and prediction by at least twofold. Additionally, to discover the potential
performance optimization from the SOTA TensorFlow model optimization toolkit for our approach,
we also provide an evaluation on the toolkit, which can serve as a guidance for other systems leveraging
on sequence-based learning approach. Overall, we conclude that our sequence-based approach,
together with our performance optimization methods, enable us to detect malware under the performance
demands of mobile devices.

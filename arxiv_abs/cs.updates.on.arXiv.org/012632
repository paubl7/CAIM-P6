In this paper, we present the first study that compares different models of Bayesian Neural Networks
(BNNs) to predict the posterior distribution of the cosmological parameters directly from the
Cosmic Microwave Background temperature and polarization maps. We focus our analysis on four different
methods to sample the weights of the network during training: Dropout, DropConnect, Reparameterization
Trick (RT), and Flipout. We find out that Flipout outperforms all other methods regardless of the
architecture used, and provides tighter constraints for the cosmological parameters. Moreover
we compare with MCMC posterior analysis obtaining comparable error correlation among parameters,
with BNNs being orders of magnitude faster in inference, although less accurate. Thanks to the speed
of the inference process with BNNs, the posterior distribution, outcome of the neural network,
can be used as the initial proposal for the Markov Chain. We show that this combined approach increases
the acceptance rate in the Metropolis-Hasting algorithm and accelerates the convergence of the
MCMC, while reaching the same final accuracy. In the second part of the paper, we present a guide to
the training and calibration of a successful multi-channel BNN for the CMB temperature and polarization
map. We show how tuning the regularization parameter for the standard deviation of the approximate
posterior on the weights in Flipout and RT we can produce unbiased and reliable uncertainty estimates,
i.e., the regularizer acts like a hyperparameter analogous to the dropout rate in Dropout. Finally,
we show how polarization, when combined with the temperature in a unique multi-channel tensor fed
to a single BNN, helps to break degeneracies among parameters and provides stringent constraints.

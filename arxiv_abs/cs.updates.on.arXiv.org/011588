Various studies have shown that immune system inspired hypermutation operators can allow artificial
immune systems (AIS) to be very efficient at escaping local optima of multimodal optimisation problems.
However, this efficiency comes at the expense of considerably slower runtimes during the exploitation
phase compared to standard evolutionary algorithms. We propose modifications to the traditional
`hypermutations with mutation potential' (HMP) that allow them to be efficient at exploitation
as well as maintaining their effective explorative characteristics. Rather than deterministically
evaluating fitness after each bit-flip of a hypermutation, we sample the fitness function stochastically
with a `parabolic' distribution which allows the `stop at first constructive mutation' (FCM) variant
of HMP to reduce the linear amount of wasted function evaluations when no improvement is found to
a constant. The stochastic distribution also allows the removal of the FCM mechanism altogether
as originally desired in the design of the HMP operators. We rigorously prove the effectiveness
of the proposed operators for all the benchmark functions where the performance of HMP is rigorously
understood in the literature and validating the gained insights to show linear speed-ups for the
identification of high quality approximate solutions to classical NP-Hard problems from combinatorial
optimisation. We then show the superiority of the HMP operators to the traditional ones in an analysis
of the complete standard Opt-IA AIS, where the stochastic evaluation scheme allows HMP and ageing
operators to work in harmony. Through a comparative performance study of other `fast mutation'
operators from the literature, we conclude that a power-law distribution for the parabolic evaluation
scheme is the best compromise in black box scenarios where little problem knowledge is available.

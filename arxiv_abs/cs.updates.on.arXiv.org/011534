Mechanical metamaterials feature engineered microstructures designed to exhibit exotic, and
often counter-intuitive, effective behaviour. Such a behaviour is often achieved through instability-induced
transformations of the underlying periodic microstructure into one or multiple patterning modes.
Due to a strong kinematic coupling of individual repeating microstructural cells, non-local behaviour
and size effects emerge, which cannot easily be captured by classical homogenization schemes.
In addition, the individual patterning modes can mutually interact in space as well as in time, while
at the engineering scale the entire structure can buckle globally. For efficient numerical macroscale
predictions, a micromorphic computational homogenization scheme has recently been developed.
Although this framework is in principle capable of accounting for spatial and temporal interactions
between individual patterning modes, its implementation relied on a gradient-based quasi-Newton
solution technique. This solver is suboptimal because (i) it has sub-quadratic convergence, and
(ii) the absence of Hessians does not allow for proper bifurcation analyses. Given that mechanical
metamaterials often rely on controlled instabilities, these limitations are serious. To address
them, a full Newton method is provided in detail in this paper. The construction of the macroscopic
tangent operator is not straightforward due to specific model assumptions on the decomposition
of the underlying displacement field pertinent to the micromorphic framework, involving orthogonality
constraints. Analytical expressions for the first and second variation of the total potential
energy are given, and the complete algorithm is listed. The developed methodology is demonstrated
with two examples in which a competition between local and global buckling exists and where multiple
patterning modes emerge.

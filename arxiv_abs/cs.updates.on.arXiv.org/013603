Identifying cause-effect relation among variables is a key step in the decision-making process.
While causal inference requires randomized experiments, researchers and policymakers are increasingly
using observational studies to test causal hypotheses due to the wide availability of observational
data and the infeasibility of experiments. The matching method is the most used technique to make
causal inference from observational data. However, the pair assignment process in one-to-one
matching creates uncertainty in the inference because of different choices made by the experimenter.
Recently, discrete optimization models are proposed to tackle such uncertainty. Although a robust
inference is possible with discrete optimization models, they produce nonlinear problems and
lack scalability. In this work, we propose greedy algorithms to solve the robust causal inference
test instances from observational data with continuous outcomes. We propose a unique framework
to reformulate the nonlinear binary optimization problems as feasibility problems. By leveraging
the structure of the feasibility formulation, we develop greedy schemes that are efficient in solving
robust test problems. In many cases, the proposed algorithms achieve global optimal solution.
We perform experiments on three real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
algorithms and compare our result with the state-of-the-art solver. Our experiments show that
the proposed algorithms significantly outperform the exact method in terms of computation time
while achieving the same conclusion for causal tests. Both numerical experiments and complexity
analysis demonstrate that the proposed algorithms ensure the scalability required for harnessing
the power of big data in the decision-making process.

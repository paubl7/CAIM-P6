StarCraft, one of the most difficult esport games with long-standing history of professional tournaments,
has attracted generations of players and fans, and also, intense attentions in artificial intelligence
research. Recently, Google's DeepMind announced AlphaStar, a grandmaster level AI in StarCraft
II that can play with humans using comparable action space and operations. In this paper, we introduce
a new AI agent, named TStarBot-X, that is trained under orders of less computations and can play competitively
with expert human players. TStarBot-X takes advantage of important techniques introduced in AlphaStar,
and also benefits from substantial innovations including new league training methods, novel multi-agent
roles, rule-guided policy search, stabilized policy improvement, lightweight neural network
architecture, and importance sampling in imitation learning, etc. We show that with orders of less
computation scale, a faithful reimplementation of AlphaStar's methods can not succeed and the
proposed techniques are necessary to ensure TStarBot-X's competitive performance. We reveal
all technical details that are complementary to those mentioned in AlphaStar, showing the most
sensitive parts in league training, reinforcement learning and imitation learning that affect
the performance of the agents. Most importantly, this is an open-sourced study that all codes and
resources (including the trained model parameters) are publicly accessible via \url{https://github.com/tencent-ailab/tleague_projpage}.
We expect this study could be beneficial for both academic and industrial future research in solving
complex problems like StarCraft, and also, might provide a sparring partner for all StarCraft II
players and other AI agents.

To build a robust and practical content-based image retrieval (CBIR) system that is applicable
to a clinical brain MRI database, we propose a new framework -- Disease-oriented image embedding
with pseudo-scanner standardization (DI-PSS) -- that consists of two core techniques, data harmonization
and a dimension reduction algorithm. Our DI-PSS uses skull stripping and CycleGAN-based image
transformations that map to a standard brain followed by transformation into a brain image taken
with a given reference scanner. Then, our 3D convolutioinal autoencoders (3D-CAE) with deep metric
learning acquires a low-dimensional embedding that better reflects the characteristics of the
disease. The effectiveness of our proposed framework was tested on the T1-weighted MRIs selected
from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative and the Parkinson's Progression Markers
Initiative. We confirmed that our PSS greatly reduced the variability of low-dimensional embeddings
caused by different scanner and datasets. Compared with the baseline condition, our PSS reduced
the variability in the distance from Alzheimer's disease (AD) to clinically normal (CN) and Parkinson
disease (PD) cases by 15.8-22.6% and 18.0-29.9%, respectively. These properties allow DI-PSS
to generate lower dimensional representations that are more amenable to disease classification.
In AD and CN classification experiments based on spectral clustering, PSS improved the average
accuracy and macro-F1 by 6.2% and 10.7%, respectively. Given the potential of the DI-PSS for harmonizing
images scanned by MRI scanners that were not used to scan the training data, we expect that the DI-PSS
is suitable for application to a large number of legacy MRIs scanned in heterogeneous environments.

Currently, unmanned aerial vehicles, such as drones, are becoming a part of our lives and reaching
out to many areas of society, including the industrialized world. A common alternative to control
the movements and actions of the drone is through unwired tactile interfaces, for which different
remote control devices can be found. However, control through such devices is not a natural, human-like
communication interface, which sometimes is difficult to master for some users. In this work, we
present a domain-based speech recognition architecture to effectively control an unmanned aerial
vehicle such as a drone. The drone control is performed using a more natural, human-like way to communicate
the instructions. Moreover, we implement an algorithm for command interpretation using both Spanish
and English languages, as well as to control the movements of the drone in a simulated domestic environment.
The conducted experiments involve participants giving voice commands to the drone in both languages
in order to compare the effectiveness of each of them, considering the mother tongue of the participants
in the experiment. Additionally, different levels of distortion have been applied to the voice
commands in order to test the proposed approach when facing noisy input signals. The obtained results
show that the unmanned aerial vehicle is capable of interpreting user voice instructions achieving
an improvement in speech-to-action recognition for both languages when using phoneme matching
in comparison to only using the cloud-based algorithm without domain-based instructions. Using
raw audio inputs, the cloud-based approach achieves 74.81% and 97.04% accuracy for English and
Spanish instructions respectively, whereas using our phoneme matching approach the results are
improved achieving 93.33% and 100.00% accuracy for English and Spanish languages.

By adhering to the dictum, "No causation without manipulation (treatment, intervention)", cause
and effect data analysis represents changes in observed data in terms of changes in the causal factors.
When causal factors are not amenable for active manipulation in the real world due to current technological
limitations or ethical considerations, a counterfactual approach performs an intervention on
the model of data formation. In the case of object representation or activity (temporal object)
representation, varying object parts is generally unfeasible whether they be spatial and/or temporal.
Multilinear algebra, the algebra of higher-order tensors, is a suitable and transparent framework
for disentangling the causal factors of data formation. Learning a part-based intrinsic causal
factor representations in a multilinear framework requires applying a set of interventions on
a part-based multilinear model. We propose a unified multilinear model of wholes and parts. We derive
a hierarchical block multilinear factorization, the M-mode Block SVD, that computes a disentangled
representation of the causal factors by optimizing simultaneously across the entire object hierarchy.
Given computational efficiency considerations, we introduce an incremental bottom-up computational
alternative, the Incremental M-mode Block SVD, that employs the lower-level abstractions, the
part representations, to represent the higher level of abstractions, the parent wholes. This incremental
computational approach may also be employed to update the causal model parameters when data becomes
available incrementally. The resulting object representation is an interpretable combinatorial
choice of intrinsic causal factor representations related to an object's recursive hierarchy
of wholes and parts that renders object recognition robust to occlusion and reduces training data
requirements.

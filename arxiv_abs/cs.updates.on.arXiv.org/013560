Federated learning (FL) is a new paradigm for large-scale learning tasks across mobile devices.
However, practical FL deployment over resource constrained mobile devices confronts multiple
challenges. For example, it is not clear how to establish an effective wireless network architecture
to support FL over mobile devices. Besides, as modern machine learning models are more and more complex,
the local on-device training/intermediate model update in FL is becoming too power hungry/radio
resource intensive for mobile devices to afford. To address those challenges, in this paper, we
try to bridge another recent surging technology, 5G, with FL, and develop a wireless transmission
and weight quantization co-design for energy efficient FL over heterogeneous 5G mobile devices.
Briefly, the 5G featured high data rate helps to relieve the severe communication concern, and the
multi-access edge computing (MEC) in 5G provides a perfect network architecture to support FL.
Under MEC architecture, we develop flexible weight quantization schemes to facilitate the on-device
local training over heterogeneous 5G mobile devices. Observed the fact that the energy consumption
of local computing is comparable to that of the model updates via 5G transmissions, we formulate
the energy efficient FL problem into a mixed-integer programming problem to elaborately determine
the quantization strategies and allocate the wireless bandwidth for heterogeneous 5G mobile devices.
The goal is to minimize the overall FL energy consumption (computing + 5G transmissions) over 5G
mobile devices while guaranteeing learning performance and training latency. Generalized Benders'
Decomposition is applied to develop feasible solutions and extensive simulations are conducted
to verify the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.

Because of the explosive growth of face photos as well as their widespread dissemination and easy
accessibility in social media, the security and privacy of personal identity information becomes
an unprecedented challenge. Meanwhile, the convenience brought by advanced identity-agnostic
computer vision technologies is attractive. Therefore, it is important to use face images while
taking careful consideration in protecting people's identities. Given a face image, face de-identification,
also known as face anonymization, refers to generating another image with similar appearance and
the same background, while the real identity is hidden. Although extensive efforts have been made,
existing face de-identification techniques are either insufficient in photo-reality or incapable
of well-balancing privacy and utility. In this paper, we focus on tackling these challenges to improve
face de-identification. We propose IdentityDP, a face anonymization framework that combines
a data-driven deep neural network with a differential privacy (DP) mechanism. This framework encompasses
three stages: facial representations disentanglement, $\epsilon$-IdentityDP perturbation
and image reconstruction. Our model can effectively obfuscate the identity-related information
of faces, preserve significant visual similarity, and generate high-quality images that can be
used for identity-agnostic computer vision tasks, such as detection, tracking, etc. Different
from the previous methods, we can adjust the balance of privacy and utility through the privacy budget
according to pratical demands and provide a diversity of results without pre-annotations. Extensive
experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generalization ability of our proposed anonymization
framework.

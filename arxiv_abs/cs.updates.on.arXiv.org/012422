This paper proposes a novel, unsupervised super-resolution (SR) approach for performing the SR
of a clinical CT into the resolution level of a micro CT ($\mu$CT). The precise non-invasive diagnosis
of lung cancer typically utilizes clinical CT data. Due to the resolution limitations of clinical
CT (about $0.5 \times 0.5 \times 0.5$ mm$^3$), it is difficult to obtain enough pathological information
such as the invasion area at alveoli level. On the other hand, $\mu$CT scanning allows the acquisition
of volumes of lung specimens with much higher resolution ($50 \times 50 \times 50 \mu {\rm m}^3$ or
higher). Thus, super-resolution of clinical CT volume may be helpful for diagnosis of lung cancer.
Typical SR methods require aligned pairs of low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) images
for training. Unfortunately, obtaining paired clinical CT and $\mu$CT volumes of human lung tissues
is infeasible. Unsupervised SR methods are required that do not need paired LR and HR images. In this
paper, we create corresponding clinical CT-$\mu$CT pairs by simulating clinical CT images from
$\mu$CT images by modified CycleGAN. After this, we use simulated clinical CT-$\mu$CT image pairs
to train an SR network based on SRGAN. Finally, we use the trained SR network to perform SR of the clinical
CT images. We compare our proposed method with another unsupervised SR method for clinical CT images
named SR-CycleGAN. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method can successfully
perform SR of clinical CT images of lung cancer patients with $\mu$CT level resolution, and quantitatively
and qualitatively outperformed conventional method (SR-CycleGAN), improving the SSIM (structure
similarity) form 0.40 to 0.51.

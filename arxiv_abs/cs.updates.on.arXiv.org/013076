In the last few decades, building regression models for non-scalar variables, including time series,
text, image, and video, has attracted increasing interests of researchers from the data analytic
community. In this paper, we focus on a multivariate time series regression problem. Specifically,
we aim to learn mathematical mappings from multiple chronologically measured numerical variables
within a certain time interval S to multiple numerical variables of interest over time interval
T. Prior arts, including the multivariate regression model, the Seq2Seq model, and the functional
linear models, suffer from several limitations. The first two types of models can only handle regularly
observed time series. Besides, the conventional multivariate regression models tend to be biased
and inefficient, as they are incapable of encoding the temporal dependencies among observations
from the same time series. The sequential learning models explicitly use the same set of parameters
along time, which has negative impacts on accuracy. The function-on-function linear model in functional
data analysis (a branch of statistics) is insufficient to capture complex correlations among the
considered time series and suffer from underfitting easily. In this paper, we propose a general
functional mapping that embraces the function-on-function linear model as a special case. We then
propose a non-linear function-on-function model using the fully connected neural network to learn
the mapping from data, which addresses the aforementioned concerns in the existing approaches.
For the proposed model, we describe in detail the corresponding numerical implementation procedures.
The effectiveness of the proposed model is demonstrated through the application to two real-world
problems.

Fact checking by professionals is viewed as a vital defense in the fight against misinformation.While
fact checking is important and its impact has been significant, fact checks could have limited visibility
and may not reach the intended audience, such as those deeply embedded in polarized communities.
Concerned citizens (i.e., the crowd), who are users of the platforms where misinformation appears,
can play a crucial role in disseminating fact-checking information and in countering the spread
of misinformation. To explore if this is the case, we conduct a data-driven study of misinformation
on the Twitter platform, focusing on tweets related to the COVID-19 pandemic, analyzing the spread
of misinformation, professional fact checks, and the crowd response to popular misleading claims
about COVID-19.In this work, we curate a dataset of false claims and statements that seek to challenge
or refute them. We train a classifier to create a novel dataset of 155,468 COVID-19-related tweets,
containing 33,237 false claims and 33,413 refuting arguments.Our findings show that professional
fact-checking tweets have limited volume and reach. In contrast, we observe that the surge in misinformation
tweets results in a quick response and a corresponding increase in tweets that refute such misinformation.
More importantly, we find contrasting differences in the way the crowd refutes tweets, some tweets
appear to be opinions, while others contain concrete evidence, such as a link to a reputed source.
Our work provides insights into how misinformation is organically countered in social platforms
by some of their users and the role they play in amplifying professional fact checks.These insights
could lead to development of tools and mechanisms that can empower concerned citizens in combating
misinformation. The code and data can be found in this http URL

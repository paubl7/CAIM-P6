Large-scale decentralized systems of autonomous agents interacting via asynchronous communication
often experience the following self-healing dilemma: fault detection inherits network uncertainties
making a remote faulty process indistinguishable from a slow process. In the case of a slow process
without fault, fault correction is undesirable as it can trigger new faults that could be prevented
with fault tolerance that is a more proactive system maintenance. But in the case of an actual faulty
process, fault tolerance alone without eventually correcting persistent faults can make systems
underperforming. Measuring, understanding and resolving such self-healing dilemmas is a timely
challenge and critical requirement given the rise of distributed ledgers, edge computing, the
Internet of Things in several energy, transport and health applications. This paper contributes
a novel and general-purpose modeling of fault scenarios during system runtime. They are used to
accurately measure and predict inconsistencies generated by the undesirable outcomes of fault
correction and fault tolerance as the means to improve self-healing of large-scale decentralized
systems at the design phase. A rigorous experimental methodology is designed that evaluates 696
experimental settings of different fault scales, fault profiles and fault detection thresholds
in a prototyped decentralized network of 3000 nodes. Almost 9 million measurements of inconsistencies
were collected in a network, where each node monitors the health status of another node, while both
can defect. The prediction performance of the modeled fault scenarios is validated in a challenging
application scenario of decentralized and dynamic in-network data aggregation using real-world
data from a Smart Grid pilot project. Findings confirm the origin of inconsistencies at design phase.

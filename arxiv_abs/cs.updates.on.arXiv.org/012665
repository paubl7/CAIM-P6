Independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA) is the state-of-the-art algorithm for blind source
separation (BSS) in the determined situation (the number of microphones is greater than or equal
to that of source signals). ILRMA achieves a great separation performance by modeling the power
spectrograms of the source signals via the nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF). Such a highly
developed source model can solve the permutation problem of the frequency-domain BSS to a large
extent, which is the reason for the excellence of ILRMA. In this paper, we further improve the separation
performance of ILRMA by additionally considering the general structure of spectrograms, which
is called consistency, and hence we call the proposed method Consistent ILRMA. Since a spectrogram
is calculated by an overlapping window (and a window function induces spectral smearing called
main- and side-lobes), the time-frequency bins depend on each other. In other words, the time-frequency
components are related to each other via the uncertainty principle. Such co-occurrence among the
spectral components can function as an assistant for solving the permutation problem, which has
been demonstrated by a recent study. On the basis of these facts, we propose an algorithm for realizing
Consistent ILRMA by slightly modifying the original algorithm. Its performance was extensively
evaluated through experiments performed with various window lengths and shift lengths. The results
indicated several tendencies of the original and proposed ILRMA that include some topics not fully
discussed in the literature. For example, the proposed Consistent ILRMA tends to outperform the
original ILRMA when the window length is sufficiently long compared to the reverberation time of
the mixing system.

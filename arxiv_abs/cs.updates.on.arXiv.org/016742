Human personality traits are the key drivers behind our decision-making, influencing our life
path on a daily basis. Inference of personality traits, such as Myers-Briggs Personality Type,
as well as an understanding of dependencies between personality traits and users' behavior on various
social media platforms is of crucial importance to modern research and industry applications.
The emergence of diverse and cross-purpose social media avenues makes it possible to perform user
personality profiling automatically and efficiently based on data represented across multiple
data modalities. However, the research efforts on personality profiling from multi-source multi-modal
social media data are relatively sparse, and the level of impact of different social network data
on machine learning performance has yet to be comprehensively evaluated. Furthermore, there is
not such dataset in the research community to benchmark. This study is one of the first attempts towards
bridging such an important research gap. Specifically, in this work, we infer the Myers-Briggs
Personality Type indicators, by applying a novel multi-view fusion framework, called "PERS" and
comparing the performance results not just across data modalities but also with respect to different
social network data sources. Our experimental results demonstrate the PERS's ability to learn
from multi-view data for personality profiling by efficiently leveraging on the significantly
different data arriving from diverse social multimedia sources. We have also found that the selection
of a machine learning approach is of crucial importance when choosing social network data sources
and that people tend to reveal multiple facets of their personality in different social media avenues.
Our released social multimedia dataset facilitates future research on this direction.

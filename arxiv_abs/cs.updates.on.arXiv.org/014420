Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) is a promising in silico technique that integrates computational
methods into drug design. An extensively used method in SBVS is molecular docking. However, the
docking process can hardly be computationally efficient and accurate simultaneously because
classic mechanics scoring function is used to approximate, but hardly reach, the quantum mechanics
precision in this method. In order to reduce the computational cost of the protein-ligand scoring
process and use data driven approach to boost the scoring function accuracy, we introduce a docking-based
SBVS method and, furthermore, a deep learning non-docking-based method that is able to avoid the
computational cost of the docking process. Then, we try to integrate these two methods into an easy-to-use
framework, ParaVS, that provides both choices for researchers. Graph neural network (GNN) is employed
in ParaVS, and we explained how our in-house GNN works and how to model ligands and molecular targets.
To verify our approaches, cross validation experiments are done on two datasets, an open dataset
Directory of Useful Decoys: Enhanced (DUD.E) and an in-house proprietary dataset without computational
generated artificial decoys (NoDecoy). On DUD.E we achieved a state-of-the-art AUC of 0.981 and
a state-of-the-art enrichment factor at 2% of 36.2; on NoDecoy we achieved an AUC of 0.974. We further
finish inference of an open database, Enamine REAL Database (RDB), that comprises over 1.36 billion
molecules in 4050 core-hours using our ParaVS non-docking method (ParaVS-ND). The inference speed
of ParaVS-ND is about 3.6e5 molecule / core-hour, while this number of a conventional docking-based
method is around 20, which is about 16000 times faster. The experiments indicate that ParaVS is accurate,
computationally efficient and can be generalized to different molecular.

Cartograms are map-based data visualizations in which the area of each map region is proportional
to an associated numeric data value (e.g., population or gross domestic product). A cartogram is
called contiguous if it conforms to this area principle while also keeping neighboring regions
connected. Because of their distorted appearance, contiguous cartograms have been criticized
as difficult to read. Some authors have suggested that cartograms may be more legible if they are
accompanied by interactive features (e.g., animations, linked brushing, or infotips). We conducted
an experiment to evaluate this claim. Participants had to perform visual analysis tasks with interactive
and noninteractive contiguous cartograms. The task types covered various aspects of cartogram
readability, ranging from elementary lookup tasks to synoptic tasks (i.e., tasks in which participants
had to summarize high-level differences between two cartograms). Elementary tasks were carried
out equally well with and without interactivity. Synoptic tasks, by contrast, were more difficult
without interactive features. With access to interactivity, however, most participants answered
even synoptic questions correctly. In a subsequent survey, participants rated the interactive
features as "easy to use" and "helpful." Our study suggests that interactivity has the potential
to make contiguous cartograms accessible even for those readers who are unfamiliar with interactive
computer graphics or do not have a prior affinity to working with maps. Among the interactive features,
animations had the strongest positive effect, so we recommend them as a minimum of interactivity
when contiguous cartograms are displayed on a computer screen.

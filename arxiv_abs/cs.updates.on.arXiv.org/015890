We present HyperMorph, a learning-based strategy for deformable image registration that removes
the need to tune important registration hyperparameters during training. Classical registration
methods solve an optimization problem to find a set of spatial correspondences between two images,
while learning-based methods leverage a training dataset to learn a function that generates these
correspondences. The quality of the results for both types of techniques depends greatly on the
choice of hyperparameters. Unfortunately, hyperparameter tuning is time-consuming and typically
involves training many separate models with various hyperparameter values, potentially leading
to suboptimal results. To address this inefficiency, we introduce amortized hyperparameter learning
for image registration, a novel strategy to learn the effects of hyperparameters on deformation
fields. The proposed framework learns a hypernetwork that takes in an input hyperparameter and
modulates a registration network to produce the optimal deformation field for that hyperparameter
value. In effect, this strategy trains a single, rich model that enables rapid, fine-grained discovery
of hyperparameter values from a continuous interval at test-time. We demonstrate that this approach
can be used to optimize multiple hyperparameters considerably faster than existing search strategies,
leading to a reduced computational and human burden as well as increased flexibility. We also show
several important benefits, including increased robustness to initialization and the ability
to rapidly identify optimal hyperparameter values specific to a registration task, dataset, or
even a single anatomical region, all without retraining the HyperMorph model. Our code is publicly

Modeling and inferring spatial relationships and predicting missing values of environmental
data are some of the main tasks of geospatial statisticians. These routine tasks are accomplished
using multivariate geospatial models and the cokriging technique. The latter requires the evaluation
of the expensive Gaussian log-likelihood function, which has impeded the adoption of multivariate
geospatial models for large multivariate spatial datasets. However, this large-scale cokriging
challenge provides a fertile ground for supercomputing implementations for the geospatial statistics
community as it is paramount to scale computational capability to match the growth in environmental
data coming from the widespread use of different data collection technologies. In this paper, we
develop and deploy large-scale multivariate spatial modeling and inference on parallel hardware
architectures. To tackle the increasing complexity in matrix operations and the massive concurrency
in parallel systems, we leverage low-rank matrix approximation techniques with task-based programming
models and schedule the asynchronous computational tasks using a dynamic runtime system. The proposed
framework provides both the dense and the approximated computations of the Gaussian log-likelihood
function. It demonstrates accuracy robustness and performance scalability on a variety of computer
systems. Using both synthetic and real datasets, the low-rank matrix approximation shows better
performance compared to exact computation, while preserving the application requirements in
both parameter estimation and prediction accuracy. We also propose a novel algorithm to assess
the prediction accuracy after the online parameter estimation. The algorithm quantifies prediction
performance and provides a benchmark for measuring the efficiency and accuracy of several approximation
techniques in multivariate spatial modeling.

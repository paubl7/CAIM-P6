In an input-queued switch, a crossbar schedule, or a matching between the input ports and the output
ports needs to be computed in each switching cycle, or time slot. Designing switching algorithms
with very low computational complexity, that lead to high throughput and small delay is a challenging
problem. There appears to be a fundamental tradeoff between the computational complexity of the
switching algorithm and the resultants throughput and delay. Parallel maximal matching algorithms
(adapted for switching) appear to have stricken a sweet spot in this tradeoff, and prior work has
shown the following performance guarantees. Using maximal matchings in every time slot results
in at least 50% switch throughput and order-optimal (i.e., independent of the switch size N) average
delay bounds for various traffic arrival processes. On the other hand, their computational complexity
can be as low as $O(log^2N)$ per port/processor, which is much lower than those of the algorithms
such as maximum weighted matching which ensures better throughput performance. In this work, we
propose QPS-r, a parallel iterative switching algorithm that has the lowest possible computational
complexity: O(1) per port. Using Lyapunov stability analysis, we show that the throughput and delay
performance is identical to that of maximal matching algorithm. Although QPS-r builds upon an existing
technique called Queue-Proportional Sampling (QPS), in this paper, we provide analytical guarantees
on its throughput and delay under i.i.d. traffic as well as a Markovian traffic model which can model
many realistic traffic patterns. We also demonstrate that QPS-3 (running 3 iterations) has comparable
empirical throughput and delay performances as iSLIP (running $log_2 N$ iterations), a refined
and optimized representative maximal matching algorithm adapted for switching.

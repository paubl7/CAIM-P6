Sentiment analysis of user-generated reviews or comments on products and services on social media
can help enterprises to analyze the feedback from customers and take corresponding actions for
improvement. To mitigate large-scale annotations, domain adaptation (DA) provides an alternate
solution by learning a transferable model from another labeled source domain. Since the labeled
data may be from multiple sources, multi-source domain adaptation (MDA) would be more practical
to exploit the complementary information from different domains. Existing MDA methods might fail
to extract some discriminative features in the target domain that are related to sentiment, neglect
the correlations of different sources as well as the distribution difference among different sub-domains
even in the same source, and cannot reflect the varying optimal weighting during different training
stages. In this paper, we propose an instance-level multi-source domain adaptation framework,
named curriculum cycle-consistent generative adversarial network (C-CycleGAN). Specifically,
C-CycleGAN consists of three components: (1) pre-trained text encoder which encodes textual input
from different domains into a continuous representation space, (2) intermediate domain generator
with curriculum instance-level adaptation which bridges the gap across source and target domains,
and (3) task classifier trained on the intermediate domain for final sentiment classification.
C-CycleGAN transfers source samples at an instance-level to an intermediate domain that is closer
to target domain with sentiment semantics preserved and without losing discriminative features.
Further, our dynamic instance-level weighting mechanisms can assign the optimal weights to different
source samples in each training stage. We conduct extensive experiments on three benchmark datasets
and achieve substantial gains over state-of-the-art approaches.

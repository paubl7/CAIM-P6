With the large-scale deployment of industrial internet of things (IIoT) devices, the number of
vulnerabilities that threaten IIoT security is also growing dramatically, including a mass of
undisclosed IIoT vulnerabilities that lack mitigation measures. Coordination Vulnerabilities
Disclosure (CVD) is one of the most popular vulnerabilities sharing solutions, in which some security
workers (SWs) can develop undisclosed vulnerabilities patches together. However, CVD assumes
that sharing participants (SWs) are all honest, and thus offering chances for dishonest SWs to leak
undisclosed IIoT vulnerabilities. To combat such threats, we propose an Undisclosed IIoT Vulnerabilities
Trusted Sharing Protection (UIV-TSP) scheme with dynamic token. In this article, a dynamic token
is an implicit access credential for an SW to acquire an undisclosed vulnerability information,
which is only held by the system and constantly updated as the SW access. Meanwhile, the latest updated
token can be stealthily sneaked into the acquired information as the traceability token. Once the
undisclosed vulnerability information leaves the SW host, the embedded self-destruct program
will be automatically triggered to prevent leaks since the destination MAC address in the traceability
token has changed. To quickly distinguish dishonest SWs, trust mechanism is adopted to evaluate
the trust value of SWs. Moreover, we design a blockchain-assisted continuous logs storage method
to achieve the tamper-proofing of dynamic token and the transparency of undisclosed IIoT vulnerabilities
sharing. The simulation results indicate that our proposed scheme is resilient to suppress dishonest
SWs and protect the IoT undisclosed vulnerabilities effectively.

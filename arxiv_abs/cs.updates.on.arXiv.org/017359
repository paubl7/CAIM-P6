Background: There is a growing awareness of the importance of human values (e.g., inclusiveness,
privacy) in software systems. However, there are no practical tools to support the integration
of human values during software development. We argue that a tool that can identify human values
from software development artefacts and present them to varying software development roles can
(partially) address this gap. We refer to such a tool as human values dashboard. Further to this,
our understanding of such a tool is limited. Aims: This study aims to (1) investigate the possibility
of using a human values dashboard to help address human values during software development, (2)
identify possible benefits of using a human values dashboard, and (3) elicit practitioners' needs
from a human values dashboard. Method: We conducted an exploratory study by interviewing 15 software
practitioners. A dashboard prototype was developed to support the interview process. We applied
thematic analysis to analyse the collected data. Results: Our study finds that a human values dashboard
would be useful for the development team (e.g., project manager, developer, tester). Our participants
acknowledge that development artefacts, especially requirements documents and issue discussions,
are the most suitable source for identifying values for the dashboard. Our study also yields a set
of high-level user requirements for a human values dashboard (e.g., it shall allow determining
values priority of a project). Conclusions: Our study suggests that a values dashboard is potentially
used to raise awareness of values and support values-based decision-making in software development.
Future work will focus on addressing the requirements and using issue discussions as potential
artefacts for the dashboard.

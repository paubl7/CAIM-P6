Parts fabricated by additive manufacturing (AM) are often fabricated first as a near-net shape,
a combination of intended nominal geometry and sacrificial support structures, which need to be
removed in a subsequent post-processing stage using subtractive manufacturing (SM). In this paper,
we present a framework for optimizing the build orientation with respect to removability of support
structures. In particular, given a general multi-axis machining setup and sampled build orientations,
we define a Pareto-optimality criterion based on the total support volume and the "secluded" support
volume defined as the support volume that is not accessible by a given set of machining tools. Since
total support volume mainly depends on the build orientation and the secluded volume is dictated
by the machining setup, in many cases the two objectives are competing and their trade-off needs
to be taken into account. The accessibility analysis relies on the inaccessibility measure field
(IMF), which is a continuous field in the Euclidean space that quantifies the inaccessibility of
each point given a collection of tools and fixturing devices. The value of IMF at each point indicates
the minimum possible volumetric collision between objects in relative motion including the part,
fixtures, and the tools, over all possible tool orientations and sharp points on the tool. We also
propose an automated support removal planning algorithm based on IMF, where a sequence of actions
are provided in terms of the fixturing devices, cutting tools, and tool orientation at each step.
In our approach, each step is chosen based on the maximal removable volume to iteratively remove
accessible supports. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through benchmark
examples in 2D and realistic examples in 3D.

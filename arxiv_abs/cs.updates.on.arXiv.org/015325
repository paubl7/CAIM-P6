To date, formal models of collective intelligence have lacked a plausible mathematical description
of the relationship between local-scale interactions between highly autonomous sub-system components
(individuals) and global-scale behavior of the composite system (the collective). In this paper
we use the Active Inference Formulation (AIF), a framework for explaining the behavior of any non-equilibrium
steady state system at any scale, to posit a minimal agent-based model that simulates the relationship
between local individual-level interaction and collective intelligence (operationalized as
system-level performance). We explore the effects of providing baseline AIF agents (Model 1) with
specific cognitive capabilities: Theory of Mind (Model 2); Goal Alignment (Model 3), and Theory
of Mind with Goal Alignment (Model 4). These stepwise transitions in sophistication of cognitive
ability are motivated by the types of advancements plausibly required for an AIF agent to persist
and flourish in an environment populated by other AIF agents, and have also recently been shown to
map naturally to canonical steps in human cognitive ability. Illustrative results show that stepwise
cognitive transitions increase system performance by providing complementary mechanisms for
alignment between agents' local and global optima. Alignment emerges endogenously from the dynamics
of interacting AIF agents themselves, rather than being imposed exogenously by incentives to agents'
behaviors (contra existing computational models of collective intelligence) or top-down priors
for collective behavior (contra existing multiscale simulations of AIF). These results shed light
on the types of generic information-theoretic patterns conducive to collective intelligence
in human and other complex adaptive systems.

Electrical energy is a vital part of modern life, and expectations for grid resilience to allow a
continuous and reliable energy supply has tremendously increased even during adverse events (e.g.,
Ukraine cyber-attack, Hurricane Maria). The global pandemic COVID-19 has raised the electric
energy reliability risk due to potential workforce disruptions, supply chain interruptions,
and increased possible cybersecurity threats. The pandemic introduces a significant degree of
uncertainly to the grid operation in the presence of other extreme events like natural disasters,
unprecedented outages, aging power grids, high proliferation of distributed generation, and
cyber-attacks. This situation increases the need for measures for the resiliency of power grids
to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic as well as simultaneous extreme events. Solutions to manage
such an adverse scenario will be multi-fold: a) emergency planning and organizational support,
b) following safety protocol, c) utilizing enhanced automation and sensing for situational awareness,
and d) integration of advanced technologies and data points for ML-driven enhanced decision support.
Enhanced digitalization and automation resulted in better network visibility at various levels,
including generation, transmission, and distribution. These data or information can be utilized
to take advantage of advanced machine learning techniques for automation and increased power grid
resilience. In this paper, a) we review the impact of COVID-19 on power grid operations and actions
taken by operators/organizations to minimize the impact of COVID-19, and b) we have presented the
recently developed tool and concepts using natural language processing (NLP) in the domain of machine
learning and artificial intelligence that can be used for increasing resiliency of power systems
in normal and in extreme scenarios such as COVID-19 pandemics.

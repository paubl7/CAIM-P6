The emergence of multiple sensory devices on or near a human body is uncovering new dynamics of extreme
edge computing. In this, a powerful and resource-rich edge device such as a smartphone or a Wi-Fi
gateway is transformed into a personal edge, collaborating with multiple devices to offer remarkable
sensory al eapplications, while harnessing the power of locality, availability, and proximity.
Naturally, this transformation pushes us to rethink how to construct accurate, robust, and efficient
sensory systems at personal edge. For instance, how do we build a reliable activity tracker with
multiple on-body IMU-equipped devices? While the accuracy of sensing models is improving, their
runtime performance still suffers, especially under this emerging multi-device, personal edge
environments. Two prime caveats that impact their performance are device and data variabilities,
contributed by several runtime factors, including device availability, data quality, and device
placement. To this end, we present SensiX, a personal edge platform that stays between sensor data
and sensing models, and ensures best-effort inference under any condition while coping with device
and data variabilities without demanding model engineering. SensiX externalises model execution
away from applications, and comprises of two essential functions, a translation operator for principled
mapping of device-to-device data and a quality-aware selection operator to systematically choose
the right execution path as a function of model accuracy. We report the design and implementation
of SensiX and demonstrate its efficacy in developing motion and audio-based multi-device sensing
systems. Our evaluation shows that SensiX offers a 7-13% increase in overall accuracy and up to 30%
increase across different environment dynamics at the expense of 3mW power overhead.

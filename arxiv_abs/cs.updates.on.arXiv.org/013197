Existing prognostic tools mainly focus on predicting the risk of mortality among patients with
coronavirus disease 2019. However, clinical evidence suggests that COVID-19 can result in non-mortal
complications that affect patient prognosis. To support patient risk stratification, we aimed
to develop a prognostic system that predicts complications common to COVID-19. In this retrospective
study, we used data collected from 3,352 COVID-19 patient encounters admitted to 18 facilities
between April 1 and April 30, 2020, in Abu Dhabi (AD), UAE. The hospitals were split based on geographical
proximity to assess for our proposed system's learning generalizability, AD Middle region and
AD Western & Eastern regions, A and B, respectively. Using data collected during the first 24 hours
of admission, the machine learning-based prognostic system predicts the risk of developing any
of seven complications during the hospital stay. The complications include secondary bacterial
infection, AKI, ARDS, and elevated biomarkers linked to increased patient severity, including
d-dimer, interleukin-6, aminotransferases, and troponin. During training, the system applies
an exclusion criteria, hyperparameter tuning, and model selection for each complication-specific
model. The system achieves good accuracy across all complications and both regions. In test set
A (587 patient encounters), the system achieves 0.91 AUROC for AKI and >0.80 AUROC for most of the
other complications. In test set B (225 patient encounters), the respective system achieves 0.90
AUROC for AKI, elevated troponin, and elevated interleukin-6, and >0.80 AUROC for most of the other
complications. The best performing models, as selected by our system, were mainly gradient boosting
models and logistic regression. Our results show that a data-driven approach using machine learning
can predict the risk of such complications with high accuracy.

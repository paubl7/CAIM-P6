Context: DevOps has become one of the fastest-growing software development paradigms in the industry.
However, this trend has presented the challenge of ensuring secure software delivery while maintaining
the agility of DevOps. The efforts to integrate security in DevOps have resulted in the DevSecOps
paradigm, which is gaining significant interest from both industry and academia. However, the
adoption of DevSecOps in practice is proving to be a challenge. Objective: This study aims to systemize
the knowledge about the challenges faced by practitioners when adopting DevSecOps and the proposed
solutions reported in the literature. We also aim to identify the areas that need further research
in the future. Method: We conducted a Systematic Literature Review of 54 peer-reviewed studies.
The thematic analysis method was applied to analyze the extracted data. Results: We identified
21 challenges related to adopting DevSecOps, 31 specific solutions, and the mapping between these
findings. We also determined key gap areas in this domain by holistically evaluating the available
solutions against the challenges. The results of the study were classified into four themes: People,
Practices, Tools, and Infrastructure. Our findings demonstrate that tool-related challenges
and solutions were the most frequently reported, driven by the need for automation in this paradigm.
Shift-left security and continuous security assessment were two key practices recommended for
DevSecOps. Conclusions: We highlight the need for developer-centered application security testing
tools that target the continuous practices in DevSecOps. More research is needed on how the traditionally
manual security practices can be automated to suit rapid software deployment cycles. Finally,
achieving a suitable balance between the speed of delivery and security is a significant issue practitioners
face in the DevSecOps paradigm.

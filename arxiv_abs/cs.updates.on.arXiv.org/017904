Delivering broadband connectivity to unconnected areas is extremely challenging. The emergence
of Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite systems has been seen as a potential solution for connecting remote
areas. Despite the hype around these new technologies, we still lack an open-source modeling framework
for assessing the techno-economics of satellite broadband connectivity which is therefore the
purpose of this paper. Firstly, a generalizable techno-economic model is presented to assess the
engineering-economics of satellite constellations. Secondly, the approach is applied to assess
the three main competing LEO constellations which include Starlink, OneWeb and Kuiper. This involves
simulating the impact on coverage, capacity and cost as both the number of satellites and quantity
of subscribers increases. Finally, a global assessment is undertaken visualizing the potential
capacity and cost per user via different subscriber scenarios. The results demonstrate how limited
the capacity will be once resources are spread across users in each satellite coverage area. For
example, if there is 1 user per 10 km^2 we estimate a mean per user capacity of 24.94 Mbps, 1.01 Mbps
and 10.30 Mbps for Starlink, OneWeb and Kuiper respectively in the busiest hour of the day. But if
the subscriber density increases to 1 user per km^2, then the mean per user capacity drops significantly
to 2.49 Mbps, 0.10 Mbps and 1.02 Mbps for Starlink, OneWeb and Kuiper respectively. LEO broadband
will be an essential part of the connectivity toolkit, but the results reveal that these mega-constellations
will most likely have to operate below 0.1 users per km^2 to provide a service that outcompetes other
broadband connectivity options. The open-source codebase which the paper contributes is provided
with the hope that other engineers will access, use, and further develop the satellite assessment
capability.

Classifying and analyzing human cells is a lengthy procedure, often involving a trained professional.
In an attempt to expedite this process, an active area of research involves automating cell classification
through use of deep learning-based techniques. In practice, a large amount of data is required to
accurately train these deep learning models. However, due to the sparse human cell datasets currently
available, the performance of these models is typically low. This study investigates the feasibility
of using few-shot learning-based techniques to mitigate the data requirements for accurate training.
The study is comprised of three parts: First, current state-of-the-art few-shot learning techniques
are evaluated on human cell classification. The selected techniques are trained on a non-medical
dataset and then tested on two out-of-domain, human cell datasets. The results indicate that, overall,
the test accuracy of state-of-the-art techniques decreased by at least 30% when transitioning
from a non-medical dataset to a medical dataset. Second, this study evaluates the potential benefits,
if any, to varying the backbone architecture and training schemes in current state-of-the-art
few-shot learning techniques when used in human cell classification. Even with these variations,
the overall test accuracy decreased from 88.66% on non-medical datasets to 44.13% at best on the
medical datasets. Third, this study presents future directions for using few-shot learning in
human cell classification. In general, few-shot learning in its current state performs poorly
on human cell classification. The study proves that attempts to modify existing network architectures
are not effective and concludes that future research effort should be focused on improving robustness
towards out-of-domain testing using optimization-based or self-supervised few-shot learning
techniques.

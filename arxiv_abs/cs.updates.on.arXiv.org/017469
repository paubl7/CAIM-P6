During the COVID-19 pandemic the Comcast network performed well in response to unprecedented changes
in Internet usage and video communications applications that are sensitive to network latency
have exploded in popularity. However, in today's typical networks-such as a home network-those
applications often degrade if they are sharing a network link with other network traffic. This is
a problem caused by a network design flaw often described using the term 'buffer bloat'. Several
years ago, Comcast helped to fund research and development in the technical community into new Active
Queue Management (AQM) techniques to eliminate this issue and AQM was later built into Data Over
Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS) standards. Just prior to the pandemic, Comcast
also deployed a large-scale network performance measurement system that included a latency under
load test. In addition, Comcast happened to deploy two otherwise identical cable modems; one with
upstream AQM enabled, and the other without. This fortuitous confluence of events has enabled Comcast
to perform a comparative analysis of the differences between cable modem gateways using AQM with
those that lack that enhancement, at a unique level of scale across many months of time and millions
of devices. The data reveals significantly better upstream latency under load performance when
AQM is used. For the device with AQM, most of the latency under load tests resulted in 15-30 milliseconds
of latency. In comparison, the device without AQM averaged roughly 250 milliseconds of latency,
between 8-16 times higher, a highly significant difference to the end user quality of experience.
These large-scale measurement comparisons should provide additional data to justify accelerated
deployment of AQM in DOCSIS and other Internet Service Provider networks and user-purchased home
network equipment.

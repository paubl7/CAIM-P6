Currently, deep learning methods have been widely applied in and thus promoted the development
of different fields. In the financial accounting field, the rapid increase in the number of financial
tickets dramatically increases labor costs; hence, using a deep learning method to relieve the
pressure on accounting is necessary. At present, a few works have applied deep learning methods
to financial ticket recognition. However, first, their approaches only cover a few types of tickets.
In addition, the precision and speed of their recognition models cannot meet the requirements of
practical financial accounting systems. Moreover, none of the methods provides a detailed analysis
of both the types and content of tickets. Therefore, this paper first analyzes the different features
of 482 kinds of financial tickets, divides all kinds of financial tickets into three categories
and proposes different recognition patterns for each category. These recognition patterns can
meet almost all types of financial ticket recognition needs. Second, regarding the fixed format
types of financial tickets (accounting for 68.27\% of the total types of tickets), we propose a simple
yet efficient network named the Financial Ticket Faster Detection network (FTFDNet) based on a
Faster RCNN. Furthermore, according to the characteristics of the financial ticket text, in order
to obtain higher recognition accuracy, the loss function, Region Proposal Network (RPN), and Non-Maximum
Suppression (NMS) are improved to make FTFDNet focus more on text. Finally, we perform a comparison
with the best ticket recognition model from the ICDAR2019 invoice competition. The experimental
results illustrate that FTFDNet increases the processing speed by 50\% while maintaining similar
precision.

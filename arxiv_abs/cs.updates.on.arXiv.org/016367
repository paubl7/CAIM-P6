The increased temporal and spectral resolution of oversampled systems allows many sensor-signal
analysis tasks to be performed (e.g. detection, classification and tracking) using a filterbank
of low-pass digital differentiators. Such filters are readily designed via flatness constraints
on the derivatives of the complex frequency response at dc, pi and at the centre frequencies of narrowband
interferers, i.e. using maximally-flat (MaxFlat) designs. Infinite-impulse-response (IIR)
filters are ideal in embedded online systems with high data-rates because computational complexity
is independent of their (fading) memory. A novel procedure for the design of MaxFlat IIR filterbanks
with improved passband phase linearity is presented in this paper, as a possible alternative to
Kalman and Wiener filters in a class of derivative-state estimation problems with uncertain signal
models. Butterworth poles are used for configurable bandwidth and guaranteed stability. Flatness
constraints of arbitrary order are derived for temporal derivatives of arbitrary order and a prescribed
group delay. As longer lags (in samples) are readily accommodated in oversampled systems, an expression
for the optimal group delay that minimizes the white-noise gain (i.e. the error variance of the derivative
estimate at steady state) is derived. Filter zeros are optimally placed for the required passband
phase response and the cancellation of narrowband interferers in the stopband, by solving a linear
system of equations. Low complexity filterbank realizations are discussed then their behaviour
is analysed in a Teager-Kaiser operator to detect pulsed signals and in a state observer to track
manoeuvring targets in simulated scenarios.

Nuclei instance segmentation plays an important role in the analysis of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained
images. While supervised deep learning (DL)-based approaches represent the state-of-the-art
in automatic nuclei instance segmentation, annotated datasets are required to train these models.
There are two main types of tissue processing protocols, namely formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded
samples (FFPE) and frozen tissue samples (FS). Although FFPE-derived H&E stained tissue sections
are the most widely used samples, H&E staining on frozen sections derived from FS samples is a relevant
method in intra-operative surgical sessions as it can be performed fast. Due to differences in the
protocols of these two types of samples, the derived images and in particular the nuclei appearance
may be different in the acquired whole slide images. Analysis of FS-derived H&E stained images can
be more challenging as rapid preparation, staining, and scanning of FS sections may lead to deterioration
in image quality. In this paper, we introduce CryoNuSeg, the first fully annotated FS-derived cryosectioned
and H&E-stained nuclei instance segmentation dataset. The dataset contains images from 10 human
organs that were not exploited in other publicly available datasets, and is provided with three
manual mark-ups to allow measuring intra-observer and inter-observer variability. Moreover,
we investigate the effects of tissue fixation/embedding protocol (i.e., FS or FFPE) on the automatic
nuclei instance segmentation performance of one of the state-of-the-art DL approaches. We also
create a baseline segmentation benchmark for the dataset that can be used in future research. A step-by-step
guide to generate the dataset as well as the full dataset and other detailed information are made
available to fellow researchers at https://github.com/masih4/CryoNuSeg.

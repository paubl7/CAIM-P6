Obtaining digital representations of multivariate continuous-time (CT) signals is a challenge
encountered in many signal processing systems. In practice, these signals are often acquired in
order to extract some underlying information, i.e., for a specific task. Employing conventional
task-agnostic analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), typically designed to minimize the mean
squared error (MSE) in reconstructing the CT input signal, can be costly and energy-inefficient
in such cases. In this work, we study task-based ADCs, which are designed to obtain a digital representation
of a multivariate CT input process with the goal of recovering an underlying statistically related
parameter vector, referred to as the task. The proposed system employs analog filtering, uniform
sampling, and scalar uniform quantization of the input process before subsequently recovering
the task vector using a digital recovery filter. We optimize the analog and digital filters and derive
closed-form expressions for the achievable MSE in recovering the task vector from a set of analog
signals when utilizing ADCs with a fixed sampling rate and amplitude resolution. Based on our derivation,
we provide guidelines for the design of practical acquisition systems subject to a constraint on
the overall number of bits. Our analysis proves that the intuitive approaches of either recovering
the task vector solely in digital or designing the analog filter to estimate the task vector are inferior
to the proposed joint design. We then consider the recovery of a set of matched filter outputs under
a rate budget. We numerically verify our theoretical observations and demonstrate that task-based
ADCs substantially outperform analog matched filtering as well as applying the matched filter
solely in the digital domain.

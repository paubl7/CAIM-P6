Spectral graph convolutional networks (SGCNs) have been attracting increasing attention in graph
representation learning partly due to their interpretability through the prism of the established
graph signal processing framework. However, existing SGCNs are limited in implementing graph
convolutions with rigid transforms that could not adapt to signals residing on graphs and tasks
at hand. In this paper, we propose a novel class of spectral graph convolutional networks that implement
graph convolutions with adaptive graph wavelets. Specifically, the adaptive graph wavelets are
learned with neural network-parameterized lifting structures, where structure-aware attention-based
lifting operations are developed to jointly consider graph structures and node features. We propose
to lift based on diffusion wavelets to alleviate the structural information loss induced by partitioning
non-bipartite graphs. By design, the locality and sparsity of the resulting wavelet transform
as well as the scalability of the lifting structure for large and varying-size graphs are guaranteed.
We further derive a soft-thresholding filtering operation by learning sparse graph representations
in terms of the learned wavelets, which improves the scalability and interpretablity, and yield
a localized, efficient and scalable spectral graph convolution. To ensure that the learned graph
representations are invariant to node permutations, a layer is employed at the input of the networks
to reorder the nodes according to their local topology information. We evaluate the proposed networks
in both node-level and graph-level representation learning tasks on benchmark citation and bioinformatics
graph datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of the proposed networks over
existing SGCNs in terms of accuracy, efficiency and scalability.

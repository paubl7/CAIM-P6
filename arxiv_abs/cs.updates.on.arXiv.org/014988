With the rapid advancement of technology, different biometric user authentication, and identification
systems are emerging. Traditional biometric systems like face, fingerprint, and iris recognition,
keystroke dynamics, etc. are prone to cyber-attacks and suffer from different disadvantages.
Electroencephalography (EEG) based authentication has shown promise in overcoming these limitations.
However, EEG-based authentication is less accurate due to signal variability at different psychological
and physiological conditions. On the other hand, keystroke dynamics-based identification offers
high accuracy but suffers from different spoofing attacks. To overcome these challenges, we propose
a novel multimodal biometric system combining EEG and keystroke dynamics. Firstly, a dataset was
created by acquiring both keystroke dynamics and EEG signals from 10 users with 500 trials per user
at 10 different sessions. Different statistical, time, and frequency domain features were extracted
and ranked from the EEG signals and key features were extracted from the keystroke dynamics. Different
classifiers were trained, validated, and tested for both individual and combined modalities for
two different classification strategies - personalized and generalized. Results show that very
high accuracy can be achieved both in generalized and personalized cases for the combination of
EEG and keystroke dynamics. The identification and authentication accuracies were found to be
99.80% and 99.68% for Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest classifiers, respectively
which outperform the individual modalities with a significant margin (around 5 percent). We also
developed a binary template matching-based algorithm, which gives 93.64% accuracy 6X faster.
The proposed method is secured and reliable for any kind of biometric authentication.

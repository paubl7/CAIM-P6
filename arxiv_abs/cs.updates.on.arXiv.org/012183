Predicting the effect of mutations in proteins is one of the most critical challenges in protein
engineering; by knowing the effect a substitution of one (or several) residues in the protein's
sequence has on its overall properties, could design a variant with a desirable function. New strategies
and methodologies to create predictive models are continually being developed. However, those
that claim to be general often do not reach adequate performance, and those that aim to a particular
task improve their predictive performance at the cost of the method's generality. Moreover, these
approaches typically require a particular decision to encode the amino acidic sequence, without
an explicit methodological agreement in such endeavor. To address these issues, in this work, we
applied clustering, embedding, and dimensionality reduction techniques to the AAIndex database
to select meaningful combinations of physicochemical properties for the encoding stage. We then
used the chosen set of properties to obtain several encodings of the same sequence, to subsequently
apply the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) on them. We perform an exploratory stage of Machine-Learning
models in the frequency space, using different algorithms and hyperparameters. Finally, we select
the best performing predictive models in each set of properties and create an assembled model. We
extensively tested the proposed methodology on different datasets and demonstrated that the generated
assembled model achieved notably better performance metrics than those models based on a single
encoding and, in most cases, better than those previously reported. The proposed method is available

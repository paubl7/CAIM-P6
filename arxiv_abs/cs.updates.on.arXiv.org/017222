LDPC codes based on multiple-edge protographs potentially have larger minimum distances compared
to their counterparts, single-edge protographs. However, considering different features of
their Tanner graph, such as short cycles, girth and other graphical structures, is harder than for
Tanner graphs from single-edge protographs. In this paper, we provide a novel approach to construct
the parity-check matrix of an LDPC code which is based on trades obtained from block designs. We employ
our method to construct two important categories of LDPC codes; quasi-cyclic (QC) LDPC and spatially-coupled
LDPC (SC-LDPC) codes. We use those trade-based matrices to define base matrices of multiple-edge
protographs. The construction of exponent matrices corresponding to these base matrices has less
complexity compared to the ones proposed in the literature. We prove that these base matrices result
in QC-LDPC codes with smaller lower bounds on the lifting degree than existing ones. There are three
categories of SC-LDPC codes: periodic, time-invariant and time-varying. Constructing the parity-check
matrix of the third one is more difficult because of the time dependency in the parity-check matrix.
We use a trade-based matrix to obtain the parity-check matrix of a time-varying SC-LDPC code in which
each downwards row displacement of the trade-based matrix yields syndrome matrices of a particular
time. Combining the different row shifts the whole parity-check matrix is obtained. Our proposed
method to construct parity-check and base matrices from trade designs is applicable to any type
of super-simple directed block designs. We apply our technique to directed designs with smallest
defining sets containing at least half of the blocks. To demonstrate the significance of our contribution,
we provide a number of numerical and simulation results.

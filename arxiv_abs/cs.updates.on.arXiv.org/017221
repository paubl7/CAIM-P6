The changing preferences of users towards items trigger the emergence of session-based recommender
systems (SBRSs), which aim to model the dynamic preferences of users for next-item recommendations.
However, most of the existing studies on SBRSs are based on long sessions only for recommendations,
ignoring short sessions, though short sessions, in fact, account for a large proportion in most
of the real-world datasets. As a result, the applicability of existing SBRSs solutions is greatly
reduced. In a short session, quite limited contextual information is available, making the next-item
recommendation very challenging. To this end, in this paper, inspired by the success of few-shot
learning (FSL) in effectively learning a model with limited instances, we formulate the next-item
recommendation as an FSL problem. Accordingly, following the basic idea of a representative approach
for FSL, i.e., meta-learning, we devise an effective SBRS called INter-SEssion collaborative
Recommender netTwork (INSERT) for next-item recommendations in short sessions. With the carefully
devised local module and global module, INSERT is able to learn an optimal preference representation
of the current user in a given short session. In particular, in the global module, a similar session
retrieval network (SSRN) is designed to find out the sessions similar to the current short session
from the historical sessions of both the current user and other users, respectively. The obtained
similar sessions are then utilized to complement and optimize the preference representation learned
from the current short session by the local module for more accurate next-item recommendations
in this short session. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world datasets demonstrate
the superiority of our proposed INSERT over the state-of-the-art SBRSs when making next-item recommendations
in short sessions.

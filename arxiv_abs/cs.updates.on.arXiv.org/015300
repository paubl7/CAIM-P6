This paper surveys state-of-the-art methods and models dedicated to time series analysis and modeling,
with the final aim of prediction. This review aims to offer a structured and comprehensive view of
the full process flow, and encompasses time series decomposition, stationary tests, modeling
and forecasting. Besides, to meet didactic purposes, a unified presentation has been adopted throughout
this survey, to present decomposition frameworks on the one hand and linear and nonlinear time series
models on the other hand. First, we decrypt the relationships between stationarity and linearity,
and further examine the main classes of methods used to test for weak stationarity. Next, the main
frameworks for time series decomposition are presented in a unified way: depending on the time series,
a more or less complex decomposition scheme seeks to obtain nonstationary effects (the deterministic
components) and a remaining stochastic component. An appropriate modeling of the latter is a critical
step to guarantee prediction accuracy. We then present three popular linear models, together with
two more flexible variants of the latter. A step further in model complexity, and still in a unified
way, we present five major nonlinear models used for time series. Amongst nonlinear models, artificial
neural networks hold a place apart as deep learning has recently gained considerable attention.
A whole section is therefore dedicated to time series forecasting relying on deep learning approaches.
A final section provides a list of R and Python implementations for the methods, models and tests
presented throughout this review. In this document, our intention is to bring sufficient in-depth
knowledge, while covering a broad range of models and forecasting methods: this compilation spans
from well-established conventional approaches to more recent adaptations of deep learning to
time series forecasting.

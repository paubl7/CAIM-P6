5G communications proposed significant improvements over 4G in terms of efficiency and security.
Among these novelties, the 5G Network Slicing seems to have a prominent role: deploy multiple virtual
network slices, each providing a different service with different needs and features. Like this,
a Slice Operator (SO) ruling a specific slice may want to offer a service for users meeting some requirements.
It is of paramount importance to provide a robust authentication protocol, able to ensure that users
meet the requirements, but providing at the same time a privacy-by-design architecture. This makes
even more sense having a growing density of Internet of Things (IoT) devices exchanging private
information over the network. In this paper, we improve the 5G network slicing authentication using
a Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) scheme: granting users full control over their data. We introduce
an approach to allow a user to prove his right to access a specific service without leaking any information
about him. Such an approach is SANS, a protocol that provides non-linkable protection for any issued
information, preventing an SO or an eavesdropper from tracking users' activity and relating it
with their real identities. Furthermore, our protocol is scalable and can be taken as a framework
for improving related technologies in similar scenarios, like authentication in the 5G Radio Access
Network (RAN) or other wireless networks and services. Such features can be achieved using cryptographic
primitives called Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP). Upon implementing our solution using a state-of-the-art
ZKP library and performing several experiments, we provide benchmarks demonstrating that our
approach is affordable in speed and memory consumption.

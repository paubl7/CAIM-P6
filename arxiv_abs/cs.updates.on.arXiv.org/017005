The last decade has seen a significant increase of interest in deep learning research, with many
public successes that have demonstrated its potential. As such, these systems are now being incorporated
into commercial products. With this comes an additional challenge: how can we build AI systems that
solve tasks where there is not a crisp, well-defined specification? While multiple solutions have
been proposed, in this competition we focus on one in particular: learning from human feedback.
Rather than training AI systems using a predefined reward function or using a labeled dataset with
a predefined set of categories, we instead train the AI system using a learning signal derived from
some form of human feedback, which can evolve over time as the understanding of the task changes,
or as the capabilities of the AI system improve. The MineRL BASALT competition aims to spur forward
research on this important class of techniques. We design a suite of four tasks in Minecraft for which
we expect it will be hard to write down hardcoded reward functions. These tasks are defined by a paragraph
of natural language: for example, "create a waterfall and take a scenic picture of it", with additional
clarifying details. Participants must train a separate agent for each task, using any method they
want. Agents are then evaluated by humans who have read the task description. To help participants
get started, we provide a dataset of human demonstrations on each of the four tasks, as well as an imitation
learning baseline that leverages these demonstrations. Our hope is that this competition will
improve our ability to build AI systems that do what their designers intend them to do, even when the
intent cannot be easily formalized. Besides allowing AI to solve more tasks, this can also enable
more effective regulation of AI systems, as well as making progress on the value alignment problem.

Personal health libraries (PHLs) provide a single point of secure access to patients digital health
data and enable the integration of knowledge stored in their digital health profiles with other
sources of global knowledge. PHLs can help empower caregivers and health care providers to make
informed decisions about patients health by understanding medical events in the context of their
lives. This paper reports the implementation of a mobile health digital intervention that incorporates
both digital health data stored in patients PHLs and other sources of contextual knowledge to deliver
tailored recommendations for improving self-care behaviors in diabetic adults. We conducted
a thematic assessment of patient functional and nonfunctional requirements that are missing from
current EHRs based on evidence from the literature. We used the results to identify the technologies
needed to address those requirements. We describe the technological infrastructures used to construct,
manage, and integrate the types of knowledge stored in the PHL. We leverage the Social Linked Data
(Solid) platform to design a fully decentralized and privacy-aware platform that supports interoperability
and care integration. We provided an initial prototype design of a PHL and drafted a use case scenario
that involves four actors to demonstrate how the proposed prototype can be used to address user requirements,
including the construction and management of the PHL and its utilization for developing a mobile
app that queries the knowledge stored and integrated into the PHL in a private and fully decentralized
manner to provide better recommendations. The proposed PHL helps patients and their caregivers
take a central role in making decisions regarding their health and equips their health care providers
with informatics tools that support the collection and interpretation of the collected knowledge.

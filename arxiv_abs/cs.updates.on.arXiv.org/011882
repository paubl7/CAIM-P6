Europe's contemporary political landscape has been shaped by massive shifts in recent decades
caused by geopolitical upheavals such as Brexit and now, COVID-19. The way in which policy makers
respond to the current pandemic could have large effects on how the world looks after the pandemic
subsides. We aim to investigate complex questions post COVID-19 around the relationships and intersections
concerning nationalism, religiosity, and anti-immigrant sentiment from a socio-cognitive perspective
by applying a mixed-method approach (survey and modelling); in a context where unprecedented contagion
threats have caused huge instability. There are still significant gaps in the scholarly literature
on populism and nationalism. In particular, there is a lack of attention to the role of evolved human
psychology in responding to persistent threats, which can fall into four broad categories in the
literature: predation (threats to one's life via being eaten or killed in some other way), contagion
(threats to one's life via physical infection), natural (threats to one's life via natural disasters),
and social (threats to one's life by destroying social standing). These threats have been discussed
in light of their effects on religion and other forms of behaviour, but they have not been employed
to study nationalist and populist behaviours. In what follows, two studies are presented that begin
to fill this gap in the literature. The first is a survey used to inform our theoretical framework
and explore the different possible relationships in an online sample. The second is a study of a computer
simulation. Both studies (completed in 2020) found very clear effects among the relevant variables,
enabling us to identify trends that require further explanation and research as we move toward models
that can adequately inform policy discussions.

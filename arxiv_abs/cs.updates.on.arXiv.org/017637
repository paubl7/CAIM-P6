In the recent decade, high-throughput plant phenotyping techniques, which combine non-invasive
image analysis and machine learning, have been successfully applied to identify and quantify plant
health and diseases. However, these techniques usually do not consider the progressive nature
of plant stress and often require images showing severe signs of stress to ensure high confidence
detection, thereby reducing the feasibility for early detection and recovery of plants under stress.
To overcome the problem mentioned above, we propose a deep learning pipeline for the temporal analysis
of the visual changes induced in the plant due to stress and apply it for the specific case of water
stress identification in Chickpea plant shoot images. For this, we have considered an image dataset
of two chickpea varieties JG-62 and Pusa-372, under three water stress conditions; control, young
seedling, and before flowering, captured over five months. We have employed a variant of the Long-term
Recurrent Convolutional Network (LRCN) to learn spatio-temporal patterns from the chickpea plant
dataset and use them for water stress classification. Our model has achieved ceiling level classification
performance of 98.52% on JG-62 and 97.78% on Pusa-372 chickpea plant data and has outperformed the
state-of-the-art time-invariant technique by at least 14% for both JG-62 and Pusa-372 species,
to the best of our knowledge. Furthermore, our LRCN model has demonstrated robustness to noisy input,
with a less than 2.5% dip in average model accuracy and a small standard deviation about the mean for
both species. Lastly, we have performed an ablation study to analyze the performance of the LRCN
model by decreasing the number of temporal session data used for training.

It is crucial for policymakers to understand the community prevalence of COVID-19 so combative
resources can be effectively allocated and prioritized during the COVID-19 pandemic. Traditionally,
community prevalence has been assessed through diagnostic and antibody testing data. However,
despite the increasing availability of COVID-19 testing, the required level has not been met in
most parts of the globe, introducing a need for an alternative method for communities to determine
disease prevalence. This is further complicated by the observation that COVID-19 prevalence and
spread varies across different spatial, temporal, and demographics. In this study, we understand
trends in the spread of COVID-19 by utilizing the results of self-reported COVID-19 symptoms surveys
as an alternative to COVID-19 testing reports. This allows us to assess community disease prevalence,
even in areas with low COVID-19 testing ability. Using individually reported symptom data from
various populations, our method predicts the likely percentage of the population that tested positive
for COVID-19. We do so with a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 1.14 and Mean Relative Error (MRE) of 60.40\%
with 95\% confidence interval as (60.12, 60.67). This implies that our model predicts +/- 1140 cases
than the original in a population of 1 million. In addition, we forecast the location-wise percentage
of the population testing positive for the next 30 days using self-reported symptoms data from previous
days. The MAE for this method is as low as 0.15 (MRE of 23.61\% with 95\% confidence interval as (23.6,
13.7)) for New York. We present an analysis of these results, exposing various clinical attributes
of interest across different demographics. Lastly, we qualitatively analyze how various policy
enactments (testing, curfew) affect the prevalence of COVID-19 in a community.

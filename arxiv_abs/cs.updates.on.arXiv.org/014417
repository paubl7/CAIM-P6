Flutter stability is a dominant design constraint of modern gas and steam turbines. To further increase
the feasible design space, flutter-tolerant designs are currently explored, which may undergo
Limit Cycle Oscillations (LCOs) of acceptable, yet not vanishing, level. Bounded self-excited
oscillations are a priori a nonlinear phenomenon, and can thus only be explained by nonlinear interactions
such as dry stick-slip friction in mechanical joints. The currently available simulation methods
for blade flutter account for nonlinear interactions, at most, in only one domain, the structure
or the fluid, and assume the behavior in the other domain as linear. In this work, we develop a fully-coupled
nonlinear frequency domain method which is capable of resolving nonlinear flow and structural
effects. We demonstrate the computational performance of this method for a state-of-the-art aeroelastic
model of a shrouded turbine blade row. Besides simulating limit cycles, we predict, for the first
time, the phenomenon of nonlinear instability, i.e., a situation where the equilibrium point is
locally stable, but for sufficiently strong perturbation (caused e.g. by an impact), the dry frictional
dissipation cannot bound the flutter vibrations. This implies that linearized theory does not
necessary lead to a conservative design of turbine blades. We show that this phenomenon is due to
the nonlinear contact interactions at the tip shrouds, which cause a change of the vibrational deflection
shape and frequency, which in turn leads to a loss of aeroelastic stability. Finally, we extend the
well-known energy method to capture these effects, and conclude that it provides a good approximation
and is useful for initializing the fully-coupled solver.

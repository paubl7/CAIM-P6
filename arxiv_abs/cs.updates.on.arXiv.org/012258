In today's integrated circuit (IC) ecosystem, owning a foundry is not economically viable, and
therefore most IC design houses are now working under a fabless business model. In order to overcome
security concerns associated with the outsorcing of IC fabrication, the Split Manufacturing technique
was proposed. In Split Manufacturing, the Front End of Line (FEOL) layers (transistors and lower
metal layers) are fabricated at an untrusted high-end foundry, while the Back End of Line (BEOL)
layers (higher metal layers) are manufactured at a trusted low-end foundry. This approach hides
the BEOL connections from the untrusted foundry, thus preventing overproduction and piracy threats.
However, many works demonstrate that BEOL connections can be derived by exploiting layout characteristics
that are introduced by heuristics employed in typical floorplanning, placement, and routing algorithms.
Since straightforward Split Manufacturing may not afford a desirable security level, many authors
propose defense techniques to be used along with Split Manufacturing. In our survey, we present
a detailed overview of the technique, the many types of attacks towards Split Manufacturing, as
well as possible defense techniques described in the literature. For the attacks, we present a concise
discussion on the different threat models and assumptions, while for the defenses we classify the
studies into three categories: proximity perturbation, wire lifting, and layout obfuscation.
The main outcome of our survey is to highlight the discrepancy between many studies -- some claim
netlists can be reconstructed with near perfect precision, while others claim marginal success
in retrieving BEOL connections. Finally, we also discuss future trends and challenges inherent
to Split Manufacturing, including the fundamental difficulty of evaluating the efficiency of
the technique.

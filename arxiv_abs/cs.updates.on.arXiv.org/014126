We consider the problem of filtering in linear state-space models (e.g., the Kalman filter setting)
through the lens of regret optimization. Different assumptions on the driving disturbance and
the observation noise sequences give rise to different estimators: in the stochastic setting to
the celebrated Kalman filter, and in the deterministic setting of bounded energy disturbances
to $H_\infty$ estimators. In this work, we formulate a novel criterion for filter design based on
the concept of regret between the estimation error energy of a clairvoyant estimator that has access
to all future observations (a so-called smoother) and a causal one that only has access to current
and past observations. The regret-optimal estimator is chosen to minimize this worst-case difference
across all bounded-energy noise sequences. The resulting estimator is adaptive in the sense that
it aims to mimic the behavior of the clairvoyant estimator, irrespective of what the realization
of the noise will be and thus interpolates between the stochastic and deterministic approaches.
We provide a solution for the regret estimation problem at two different levels. First, we provide
a solution at the operator level by reducing it to the Nehari problem. Second, for state-space models,
we explicitly find the estimator that achieves the optimal regret. From a computational perspective,
the regret-optimal estimator can be easily implemented by solving three Riccati equations and
a single Lyapunov equation. For a state-space model of dimension $n$, the regret-optimal estimator
has a state-space structure of dimension $3n$. We demonstrate the applicability and efficacy of
the estimator in a variety of problems and observe that the estimator has average and worst-case
performances that are simultaneously close to their optimal values. We therefore argue that regret-optimality
is a viable approach to estimator design.

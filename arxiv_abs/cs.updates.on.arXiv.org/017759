We consider a nonlocal evolution equation representing the continuum limit of a large ensemble
of interacting particles on graphs forced by noise. The two principle ingredients of the continuum
model are a nonlocal term and Q-Wiener process describing the interactions among the particles
in the network and stochastic forcing respectively. The network connectivity is given by a square
integrable function called a graphon. We prove that the initial value problem for the continuum
model is well-posed. Further, we construct a semidiscrete (discrete in space and continuous in
time) and a fully discrete schemes for the nonlocal model. The former is obtained by a discontinuous
Galerkin method and the latter is based on further discretizing time using the Euler-Maruyama method.
We prove convergence and estimate the rate of convergence in each case. For the semidiscrete scheme,
the rate of convergence estimate is expressed in terms of the regularity of the graphon, Q-Wiener
process, and the initial data. We work in generalized Lipschitz spaces, which allows to treat models
with data of lower regularity. This is important for applications as many interesting types of connectivity
including small-world and power-law are expressed by graphons that are not smooth. The error analysis
of the fully discrete scheme, on the other hand, reveals that for some models common in applied science,
one has a higher speed of convergence than that predicted by the standard estimates for the Euler-Maruyama
method. The rate of convergence analysis is supplemented with detailed numerical experiments,
which are consistent with our analytical results. As a by-product, this work presents a rigorous
justification for taking continuum limit for a large class of interacting dynamical systems on
graphs subject to noise.

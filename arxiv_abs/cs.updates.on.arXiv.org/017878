Input-output analysis of transitional channel flows has proven to be a valuable analytical tool
for identifying important flow structures and energetic motions. The traditional approach abstracts
the nonlinear terms as forcing that is unstructured, in the sense that this forcing is not directly
tied to the underlying nonlinearity in the dynamics. This paper instead employs a structured singular
value-based approach that preserves certain input-output properties of the nonlinear forcing
function in an effort to recover the larger range of key flow features identified through nonlinear
analysis, experiments, and direct numerical simulation (DNS) of transitional channel flows.
Application of this method to transitional plane Couette and plane Poiseuille flows leads to not
only the identification of the streamwise coherent structures predicted through traditional
input-output approaches, but also the characterization of the oblique flow structures as those
requiring the least energy to induce transition in agreement with DNS studies, and nonlinear optimal
perturbation analysis. The proposed approach also captures the recently observed oblique turbulent
bands that have been linked to transition in experiments and DNS with very large channel size. The
ability to identify the larger amplification of the streamwise varying structures predicted from
DNS and nonlinear analysis in both flow regimes suggests that the structured approach allows one
to maintain the nonlinear effects associated with weakening of the lift-up mechanism, which is
known to dominate the linear operator. Capturing this key nonlinear effect enables the prediction
of the wider range of known transitional flow structures within the analytical input-output modeling
paradigm.

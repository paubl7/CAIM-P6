This thesis explores a particular class of distributed optimization methods for various separable
resource allocation problems, which are of high interest in a wide array of multi-agent settings.
A distinctly motivating application for this thesis is real-time power dispatch of distributed
energy resources for providing frequency control in a distribution grid or microgrid with high
renewable energy penetration. In this application, it is paramount that agent data be shared as
sparsely as possible in the interest of conserving user privacy, and it is required that algorithms
scale gracefully as the network size increases to the order of thousands or millions of resources
and devices. Distributed algorithms are naturally well-poised to address these challenges, in
contrast to more traditional centralized algorithms which scale poorly and require global access
to information. The class of distributed optimization methods explored here can be broadly described
as Newton-like or second-order, implying utilization of second-derivative information of the
cost functions, in contrast to well-studied gradient-based or first-order methods. We consider
three formulations of separable resource-allocation problems and develop a Newton-like algorithm
for each. The analysis and simulation studies in the subsequent chapters demonstrate the advantages
of our approaches over existing methods; most commonly, we note that convergence rates are substantially
improved. We supplement our algorithm development for these three problem formulations with a
network design technique, in which we can construct a maximally-connected network by adding some
edges to the underlying communication graph, and a real demonstration of distributed algorithms
on a large set of heterogeneous devices on the UC San Diego microgrid.

There is growing interest in fully electric vehicles in the automotive industry as it becomes increasingly
more difficult to meet new and upcoming emission regulations based on internal combustion engines.
Fully electric vehicles do not have an internal combustion engine. Hence, drive torque change for
a traction control system and for a yaw stability control system has to be through the electric motor
used for traction. The regenerative braking capability of fully electric vehicles has to be taken
into account in designing braking controllers like ABS and yaw stability control through differential
braking. Fully electric vehicles are usually lighter vehicles with different dynamic characteristics
than that of their predecessors using internal combustion engines. As such, their yaw stability
control systems have to be re-designed and tested. This paper reports the initial results of ongoing
work on yaw stability controller design for a fully electric vehicle. Two different implementations
on a research prototype fully electric light commercial vehicle are considered. The first implementation
uses the production yaw stability control system in the internal combustion engine powered conventional
vehicle. The drive torque change commands from the production ECU are read, modified and sent to
the electric motor driver in trying to mimic the conventional vehicle. The differential braking
commands are the same as in the conventional vehicle. In the second implementation, a generic yaw
stability control system that calculates and issues its own drive torque change commands and differential
braking commands is designed and implemented. Offline simulations on a validated model and a hardware-in-the-loop
simulation system are used in designing the yaw stability control system.

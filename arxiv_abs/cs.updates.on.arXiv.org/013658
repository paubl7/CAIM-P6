Quantitative assessment of cardiac left ventricle (LV) morphology is essential to assess cardiac
function and improve the diagnosis of different cardiovascular diseases. In current clinical
practice, LV quantification depends on the measurement of myocardial shape indices, which is usually
achieved by manual contouring of the endo- and epicardial. However, this process subjected to inter
and intra-observer variability, and it is a time-consuming and tedious task. In this paper, we propose
a spatio-temporal multi-task learning approach to obtain a complete set of measurements quantifying
cardiac LV morphology, regional-wall thickness (RWT), and additionally detecting the cardiac
phase cycle (systole and diastole) for a given 3D Cine-magnetic resonance (MR) image sequence.
We first segment cardiac LVs using an encoder-decoder network and then introduce a multitask framework
to regress 11 LV indices and classify the cardiac phase, as parallel tasks during model optimization.
The proposed deep learning model is based on the 3D spatio-temporal convolutions, which extract
spatial and temporal features from MR images. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method
using cine-MR sequences of 145 subjects and comparing the performance with other state-of-the-art
quantification methods. The proposed method obtained high prediction accuracy, with an average
mean absolute error (MAE) of 129 $mm^2$, 1.23 $mm$, 1.76 $mm$, Pearson correlation coefficient
(PCC) of 96.4%, 87.2%, and 97.5% for LV and myocardium (Myo) cavity regions, 6 RWTs, 3 LV dimensions,
and an error rate of 9.0\% for phase classification. The experimental results highlight the robustness
of the proposed method, despite varying degrees of cardiac morphology, image appearance, and low
contrast in the cardiac MR sequences.

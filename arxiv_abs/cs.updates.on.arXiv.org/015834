Tremor is a key diagnostic feature of Parkinson's Disease (PD), Essential Tremor (ET), and other
central nervous system (CNS) disorders. Clinicians or trained raters assess tremor severity with
TETRAS scores by observing patients. Lacking quantitative measures, inter- or intra- observer
variabilities are almost inevitable as the distinction between adjacent tremor scores is subtle.
Moreover, clinician assessments also require patient visits, which limits the frequency of disease
progress evaluation. Therefore it is beneficial to develop an automated assessment that can be
performed remotely and repeatably at patients' convenience for continuous monitoring. In this
work, we proposed to train a deep neural network (DNN) with rank-consistent ordinal regression
using 276 clinical videos from 36 essential tremor patients. The videos are coupled with clinician
assessed TETRAS scores, which are used as ground truth labels to train the DNN. To tackle the challenge
of limited training data, optical flows are used to eliminate irrelevant background and statistic
objects from RGB frames. In addition to optical flows, transfer learning is also applied to leverage
pre-trained network weights from a related task of tremor frequency estimate. The approach was
evaluated by splitting the clinical videos into training (67%) and testing sets (0.33%). The mean
absolute error on TETRAS score of the testing results is 0.45, indicating that most of the errors
were from the mismatch of adjacent labels, which is expected and acceptable. The model predications
also agree well with clinical ratings. This model is further applied to smart phone videos collected
from a PD patient who has an implanted device to turn "On" or "Off" tremor. The model outputs were consistent
with the patient tremor states. The results demonstrate that our trained model can be used as a means
to assess and track tremor severity.

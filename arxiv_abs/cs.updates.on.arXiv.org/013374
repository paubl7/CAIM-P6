Accurate aircraft-mass estimation is critical to airlines from the safety-management and performance-optimization
viewpoints. Overloading an aircraft with passengers and baggage might result in a safety hazard.
In contrast, not fully utilizing an aircraft's payload-carrying capacity undermines its operational
efficiency and airline profitability. However, accurate determination of the aircraft mass for
each operating flight is not feasible because it is impractical to weigh each aircraft component,
including the payload. The existing methods for aircraft-mass estimation are dependent on the
aircraft- and engine-performance parameters, which are usually considered proprietary information.
Moreover, the values of these parameters vary under different operating conditions while those
of others might be subject to large estimation errors. This paper presents a data-driven method
involving use of the quick access recorder (QAR)-a digital flight-data recorder-installed on
all aircrafts to record the initial aircraft climb mass during each flight. The method requires
users to select appropriate parameters among several thousand others recorded by the QAR using
physical models. The selected data are subsequently processed and provided as input to a multilayer
perceptron neural network for building the model for initial-climb aircraft-mass prediction.
Thus, the proposed method offers the advantages of both the model-based and data-driven approaches
for aircraft-mass estimation. Because this method does not explicitly rely on any aircraft or engine
parameter, it is universally applicable to all aircraft types. In this study, the proposed method
was applied to a set of Boeing 777-300ER aircrafts, the results of which demonstrated reasonable
accuracy. Airlines can use this tool to better utilize aircraft's payload.

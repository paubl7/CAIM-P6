Causal decision making (CDM) at scale has become a routine part of business, and increasingly CDM
is based on machine learning algorithms. For example, businesses often target offers, incentives,
and recommendations with the goal of affecting consumer behavior. Recently, we have seen an acceleration
of research related to CDM and to causal effect estimation (CEE) using machine learned models. This
article highlights an important perspective: CDM is not the same as CEE, and counterintuitively,
accurate CEE is not necessary for accurate CDM. Our experience is that this is not well understood
by practitioners nor by most researchers. Technically, the estimand of interest is different,
and this has important implications both for modeling and for the use of statistical models for CDM.
We draw on recent research to highlight three of these implications. (1) We should carefully consider
the objective function of the causal machine learning, and if possible, we should optimize for accurate
"treatment assignment" rather than for accurate effect-size estimation. (2) Confounding does
not have the same effect on CDM as it does on CEE. The upshot here is that for supporting CDM it may be
just as good to learn with confounded data as with unconfounded data. Finally, (3) causal statistical
modeling may not be necessary at all to support CDM, because there may be (and perhaps often is) a proxy
target for statistical modeling that can do as well or better. This observation helps to explain
at least one broad common CDM practice that seems "wrong" at first blush: the widespread use of non-causal
models for targeting interventions. Our perspective is that these observations open up substantial
fertile ground for future research. Whether or not you share our perspective completely, we hope
we facilitate future research in this area by pointing to related articles from multiple contributing
fields.

Dynamic capabilities theory emerged as a leading framework in the process of value creation for
firms. Its core notion complements the premise of the resource-based view of the firm and is considered
an important theoretical and management framework in modern information systems research. However,
despite DCTs significant contributions, its strength and core focus are essentially in its use
for historical firm performance explanation. Furthermore, valuable contributions have been
made by several researchers in order to extend the DCT to fit the constantly changing IT environments
and other imperative drivers for competitive performance. However, no DCT extension has been developed
which allows firms to integrally assess their current state of maturity in order to derive imperative
steps for further performance enhancements. In light of empirical advancement, this paper aims
to develop a strategic alignment model for IT flexibility and dynamic capabilities and empirically
validates proposed hypotheses using correlation and regression analyses on a large data sample
of 322 international firms. We conjecture that the combined synergetic effect of the underlying
dimensions of a firms IT flexibility architecture and dynamic capabilities enables organizations
to cope with changing environmental conditions and drive competitive firm performance. Findings
of this study suggest that there is a significant positive relationship between the firms degree
of strategic alignment defined as the degree of balance between all dimensions and competitive
firm performance. Strategic alignment can, therefore, be seen as an important condition that significantly
influences a firms competitive advantage in constantly changing environments. The proposed framework
helps firms assess and improve their maturity and alignment of IT flexibility and dynamic capabilities.

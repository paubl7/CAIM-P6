At the present time Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) is among the most commonly used non-invasive
imaging methods for the acquisition of large volumetric scans of human retinal tissues and vasculature.
To resolve decisive information from extracted OCT volumes and to make it applicable for further
diagnostic analysis, the exact identification of retinal layer thicknesses serves as an essential
task be done for each patient separately. However, the manual examination of multiple OCT scans
in a row is a demanding and time consuming task, which results in a lengthy qualification process
and is frequently confounded in the presence of tissue-dependent speckle noise. Therefore, the
elaboration of automated segmentation models has become an important task in the field of medical
image processing. We propose a novel, purely data driven \textit{geometric approach to order-constrained
3D OCT retinal cell layer segmentation} which takes as input data in any metric space and comes along
with basic operations that can be effectively computed in parallel. As opposed to many established
retina detection methods, our presented formulation avoids the use of any shape prior and accomplishes
the natural order of the retina in a purely geometric way. This makes the approach unbiased and hence
suited for the detection of local anatomical changes of retinal tissue structure. To demonstrate
robustness of the proposed approach, we compare two different choices of features on a data set of
manually annotated 3D OCT volumes of healthy human retina. The quality of computed segmentations
is compared to the state of the art in terms of mean absolute error and the Dice similarity coefficient.
The results indicate a great potential for applying our method to the classification of diseased
retina and opens a new research direction regarding the joint segmentation of retinal cell layers
and blood vessel structures.

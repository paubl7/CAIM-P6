Logic locking is a prominent technique to protect the integrity of hardware designs throughout
the integrated circuit design and fabrication flow. However, in recent years, the security of locking
schemes has been thoroughly challenged by the introduction of various deobfuscation attacks.
As in most research branches, deep learning is being introduced in the domain of logic locking as
well. Therefore, in this paper we present SnapShot: a novel attack on logic locking that is the first
of its kind to utilize artificial neural networks to directly predict a key bit value from a locked
synthesized gate-level netlist without using a golden reference. Hereby, the attack uses a simpler
yet more flexible learning model compared to existing work. Two different approaches are evaluated.
The first approach is based on a simple feedforward fully connected neural network. The second approach
utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve more complex convolutional neural network architectures
specialized for the given task. The attack flow offers a generic and customizable framework for
attacking locking schemes using machine learning techniques. We perform an extensive evaluation
of SnapShot for two realistic attack scenarios, comprising both reference benchmark circuits
as well as silicon-proven RISC-V core modules. The evaluation results show that SnapShot achieves
an average key prediction accuracy of 82.60% for the selected attack scenario, with a significant
performance increase of 10.49 percentage points compared to the state of the art. Moreover, SnapShot
outperforms the existing technique on all evaluated benchmarks. The results indicate that the
security foundation of common logic locking schemes is build on questionable assumptions. The
conclusions of the evaluation offer insights into the challenges of designing future logic locking
schemes that are resilient to machine learning attacks.

Developing machine learning models to support health analytics requires increased understanding
about statistical properties of self-rated expression statements. We analyzed self-rated expression
statements concerning the coronavirus COVID-19 epidemic to identify statistically significant
differences between groups of respondents and to detect the patient's need for help with machine
learning. Our quantitative study gathered the "need for help" ratings for twenty health-related
expression statements concerning the coronavirus epidemic on a 11-point Likert scale, and nine
answers about the person's health and wellbeing, sex and age. Online respondents between 30 May
and 3 August 2020 were recruited from Finnish patient and disabled people's organizations, other
health-related organizations and professionals, and educational institutions (n=673). We analyzed
rating differences and dependencies with Kendall rank-correlation and cosine similarity measures
and tests of Wilcoxon rank-sum, Kruskal-Wallis and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) between
groups, and carried out machine learning experiments with a basic implementation of a convolutional
neural network algorithm. We found statistically significant correlations and high cosine similarity
values between various health-related expression statement pairs concerning the "need for help"
ratings and a background question pair. We also identified statistically significant rating differences
for several health-related expression statements in respect to groupings based on the answer values
of background questions, such as the ratings of suspecting to have the coronavirus infection and
having it depending on the estimated health condition, quality of life and sex. Our experiments
with a convolutional neural network algorithm showed the applicability of machine learning to
support detecting the need for help in the patient's expressions.

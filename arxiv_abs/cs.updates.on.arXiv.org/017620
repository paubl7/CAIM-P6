Model checkers provide algorithms for proving that a mathematical model of a system satisfies a
given specification. In case of a violation, a counterexample that shows the erroneous behavior
is returned. Understanding these counterexamples is challenging, especially for hyperproperty
specifications, i.e., specifications that relate multiple executions of a system to each other.
We aim to facilitate the visual analysis of such counterexamples through our HyperVis tool, which
provides interactive visualizations of the given model, specification, and counterexample.
Within an iterative and interdisciplinary design process, we developed visualization solutions
that can effectively communicate the core aspects of the model checking result. Specifically,
we introduce graphical representations of binary values for improving pattern recognition, color
encoding for better indicating related aspects, visually enhanced textual descriptions, as well
as extensive cross-view highlighting mechanisms. Further, through an underlying causal analysis
of the counterexample, we are also able to identify values that contributed to the violation and
use this knowledge for both improved encoding and highlighting. Finally, the analyst can modify
both the specification of the hyperproperty and the system directly within HyperVis and initiate
the model checking of the new version. In combination, these features notably support the analyst
in understanding the error leading to the counterexample as well as iterating the provided system
and specification. We ran multiple case studies with HyperVis and tested it with domain experts
in qualitative feedback sessions. The participants' positive feedback confirms the considerable
improvement over the manual, text-based status quo and the value of the tool for explaining hyperproperties.

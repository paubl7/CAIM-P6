Continual learning from data streams is among the most important topics in contemporary machine
learning. One of the biggest challenges in this domain lies in creating algorithms that can continuously
adapt to arriving data. However, previously learned knowledge may become outdated, as streams
evolve over time. This phenomenon is known as concept drift and must be detected to facilitate efficient
adaptation of the learning model. While there exists a plethora of drift detectors, all of them assume
that we are dealing with roughly balanced classes. In the case of imbalanced data streams, those
detectors will be biased towards the majority classes, ignoring changes happening in the minority
ones. Furthermore, class imbalance may evolve over time and classes may change their roles (majority
becoming minority and vice versa). This is especially challenging in the multi-class setting,
where relationships among classes become complex. In this paper, we propose a detailed taxonomy
of challenges posed by concept drift in multi-class imbalanced data streams, as well as a novel trainable
concept drift detector based on Restricted Boltzmann Machine. It is capable of monitoring multiple
classes at once and using reconstruction error to detect changes in each of them independently.
Our detector utilizes a skew-insensitive loss function that allows it to handle multiple imbalanced
distributions. Due to its trainable nature, it is capable of following changes in a stream and evolving
class roles, as well as it can deal with local concept drift occurring in minority classes. Extensive
experimental study on multi-class drifting data streams, enriched with a detailed analysis of
the impact of local drifts and changing imbalance ratios, confirms the high efficacy of our approach.

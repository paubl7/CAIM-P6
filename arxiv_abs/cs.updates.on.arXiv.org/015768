We study how to rank candidates based on individual rankings via positional scoring rules. Each
position in each individual ranking is worth a certain number of points; the total sum of points determines
the aggregate ranking. First, we impose the principle of consistency: once one of the candidates
is removed, we want the aggregate ranking to remain intact. This principle is crucial whenever the
set of the candidates might change and the remaining ranking guides our actions: whom should we interview
if our first choice got a better offer? Who gets the cup once the previous winner is convicted of doping?
Which movie should a group watch if everyone already saw the recommender system's first choice?
Will adding a spoiler candidate rig the election? No scoring rule is completely consistent, but
two weaker axioms - independence of removing a unanimous winner and a unanimous loser - pin down a
one-parameter family with geometric scores. This family includes Borda count, generalised plurality
(medal count), and generalised antiplurality (threshold rule) as edge cases, and we provide new
axiomatisations of these rules. Second, for sports competitions we introduce a model of the organiser's
objective and derive a one-parameter family with optimal scores: the athletes should be ranked
according to their expected overall quality. Finally, using historical data from biathlon, golf,
and running we demonstrate how the geometric and optimal scores can simplify the selection of suitable
scoring rules, show that these scores closely resemble the actual scores used by the organisers,
and provide an explanation for empirical phenomena observed in golf tournaments. We see that geometric
scores approximate the optimal scores well in events where the distribution of athletes' performances
is roughly uniform.

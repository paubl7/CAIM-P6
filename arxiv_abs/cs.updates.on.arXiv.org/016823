A key challenge in mining social media data streams is to identify events which are actively discussed
by a group of people in a specific local or global area. Such events are useful for early warning for
accident, protest, election or breaking news. However, neither the list of events nor the resolution
of both event time and space is fixed or known beforehand. In this work, we propose an online spatio-temporal
event detection system using social media that is able to detect events at different time and space
resolutions. First, to address the challenge related to the unknown spatial resolution of events,
a quad-tree method is exploited in order to split the geographical space into multiscale regions
based on the density of social media data. Then, a statistical unsupervised approach is performed
that involves Poisson distribution and a smoothing method for highlighting regions with unexpected
density of social posts. Further, event duration is precisely estimated by merging events happening
in the same region at consecutive time intervals. A post processing stage is introduced to filter
out events that are spam, fake or wrong. Finally, we incorporate simple semantics by using social
media entities to assess the integrity, and accuracy of detected events. The proposed method is
evaluated using different social media datasets: Twitter and Flickr for different cities: Melbourne,
London, Paris and New York. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we compare our results
with two baseline algorithms based on fixed split of geographical space and clustering method.
For performance evaluation, we manually compute recall and precision. We also propose a new quality
measure named strength index, which automatically measures how accurate the reported event is.

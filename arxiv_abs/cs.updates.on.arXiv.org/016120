Active contours Model (ACM) has been extensively used in computer vision and image processing.
In recent studies, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) have been combined with active contours
replacing the user in the process of contour evolution and image segmentation to eliminate limitations
associated with ACM's dependence on parameters of the energy functional and initialization. However,
prior works did not aim for automatic initialization which is addressed here. In addition to manual
initialization, current methods are highly sensitive to initial location and fail to delineate
borders accurately. We propose a fully automatic image segmentation method to address problems
of manual initialization, insufficient capture range, and poor convergence to boundaries, in
addition to the problem of assignment of energy functional parameters. We train two CNNs, which
predict active contour weighting parameters and generate a ground truth mask to extract Distance
Transform (DT) and an initialization circle. Distance transform is used to form a vector field pointing
from each pixel of the image towards the closest point on the boundary, the size of which is equal to
the Euclidean distance map. We evaluate our method on four publicly available datasets including
two building instance segmentation datasets, Vaihingen and Bing huts, and two mammography image
datasets, INBreast and DDSM-BCRP. Our approach outperforms latest research by 0.59 ans 2.39 percent
in mean Intersection-over-Union (mIoU), 7.38 and 8.62 percent in Boundary F-score (BoundF) for
Vaihingen and Bing huts datasets, respectively. Dice similarity coefficient for the INBreast
and DDSM-BCRP datasets is 94.23% and 90.89%, respectively indicating our method is comparable
to state-of-the-art frameworks.

Secure software leasing (SSL) is a quantum cryptographic primitive that enables users to execute
software only during the software is leased. It prevents users from executing leased software after
they return the leased software to its owner. SSL can make software distribution more flexible and
controllable. Although SSL is an attractive cryptographic primitive, the existing SSL scheme
is based on public key quantum money, which is not instantiated with standard cryptographic assumptions
so far. Moreover, the existing SSL scheme only supports a subclass of evasive functions. In this
work, we present SSL schemes based on the learning with errors assumption (LWE). Specifically,
our contributions consist of the following. - We construct an SSL scheme for pseudorandom functions
from the LWE assumption against quantum adversaries. - We construct an SSL scheme for a subclass
of evasive functions from the LWE assumption against sub-exponential quantum adversaries. - We
construct SSL schemes for the functionalities above with classical communication from the LWE
assumption against (sub-exponential) quantum adversaries. SSL with classical communication
means that entities exchange only classical information though they run quantum computation locally.
Our crucial tool is two-tier quantum lightning, which is introduced in this work and a relaxed version
of quantum lighting. In two-tier quantum lightning schemes, we have a public verification algorithm
called semi-verification and a private verification algorithm called full-verification. An
adversary cannot generate possibly entangled two quantum states whose serial numbers are the same
such that one passes the semi-verification, and the other also passes the full-verification. We
show that we can construct a two-tier quantum lightning scheme from the LWE assumption.

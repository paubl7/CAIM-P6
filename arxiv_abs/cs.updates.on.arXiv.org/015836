Wound prognostic models not only provide an estimate of wound healing time to motivate patients
to follow up their treatments but also can help clinicians to decide whether to use a standard care
or adjuvant therapies and to assist them with designing clinical trials. However, collecting prognosis
factors from Electronic Medical Records (EMR) of patients is challenging due to privacy, sensitivity,
and confidentiality. In this study, we developed time series medical generative adversarial networks
(GANs) to generate synthetic wound prognosis factors using very limited information collected
during routine care in a specialized wound care facility. The generated prognosis variables are
used in developing a predictive model for chronic wound healing trajectory. Our novel medical GAN
can produce both continuous and categorical features from EMR. Moreover, we applied temporal information
to our model by considering data collected from the weekly follow-ups of patients. Conditional
training strategies were utilized to enhance training and generate classified data in terms of
healing or non-healing. The ability of the proposed model to generate realistic EMR data was evaluated
by TSTR (test on the synthetic, train on the real), discriminative accuracy, and visualization.
We utilized samples generated by our proposed GAN in training a prognosis model to demonstrate its
real-life application. Using the generated samples in training predictive models improved the
classification accuracy by 6.66-10.01% compared to the previous EMR-GAN. Additionally, the suggested
prognosis classifier has achieved the area under the curve (AUC) of 0.975, 0.968, and 0.849 when
training the network using data from the first three visits, first two visits, and first visit, respectively.
These results indicate a significant improvement in wound healing prediction compared to the previous
prognosis models.

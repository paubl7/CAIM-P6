This paper aims at providing extremely efficient algorithms for approximate query enumeration
on sparse databases, that come with performance and accuracy guarantees. We introduce a new model
for approximate query enumeration on classes of relational databases of bounded degree. We first
prove that on databases of bounded degree any local first-order definable query can be enumerated
approximately with constant delay after a constant time preprocessing phase. We extend this, showing
that on databases of bounded tree-width and bounded degree, every query that is expressible in first-order
logic can be enumerated approximately with constant delay after a sublinear (more precisely, polylogarithmic)
time preprocessing phase. Durand and Grandjean (ACM Transactions on Computational Logic 2007)
proved that exact enumeration of first-order queries on databases of bounded degree can be done
with constant delay after a linear time preprocessing phase. Hence we achieve a significant speed-up
in the preprocessing phase. Since sublinear running time does not allow reading the whole input
database even once, sacrificing some accuracy is inevitable for our speed-up. Nevertheless, our
enumeration algorithms come with guarantees: With high probability, (1) only tuples are enumerated
that are answers to the query or `close' to being answers to the query, and (2) if the proportion of
tuples that are answers to the query is sufficiently large, then all answers will be enumerated.
Here the notion of `closeness' is a tuple edit distance in the input database. For local first-order
queries, only actual answers are enumerated, strengthening (1). Moreover, both the `closeness'
and the proportion required in (2) are controllable. We combine methods from property testing of
bounded degree graphs with logic and query enumeration, which we believe can inspire further research.

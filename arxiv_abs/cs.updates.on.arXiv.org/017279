Accurate computing, analysis and modeling of the ventricles and myocardium from medical images
are important, especially in the diagnosis and treatment management for patients suffering from
myocardial infarction (MI). Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)
provides an important protocol to visualize MI. However, automated segmentation of LGE CMR is still
challenging, due to the indistinguishable boundaries, heterogeneous intensity distribution
and complex enhancement patterns of pathological myocardium from LGE CMR. Furthermore, compared
with the other sequences LGE CMR images with gold standard labels are particularly limited, which
represents another obstacle for developing novel algorithms for automatic segmentation of LGE
CMR. This paper presents the selective results from the Multi-Sequence Cardiac MR (MS-CMR) Segmentation
challenge, in conjunction with MICCAI 2019. The challenge offered a data set of paired MS-CMR images,
including auxiliary CMR sequences as well as LGE CMR, from 45 patients who underwent cardiomyopathy.
It was aimed to develop new algorithms, as well as benchmark existing ones for LGE CMR segmentation
and compare them objectively. In addition, the paired MS-CMR images could enable algorithms to
combine the complementary information from the other sequences for the segmentation of LGE CMR.
Nine representative works were selected for evaluation and comparisons, among which three methods
are unsupervised methods and the other six are supervised. The results showed that the average performance
of the nine methods was comparable to the inter-observer variations. The success of these methods
was mainly attributed to the inclusion of the auxiliary sequences from the MS-CMR images, which
provide important label information for the training of deep neural networks.

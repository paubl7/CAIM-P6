Spatiotemporal traffic time series (e.g., traffic volume/speed) collected from sensing systems
are often incomplete with considerable corruption and large amounts of missing values, preventing
users from harnessing the full power of the data. Missing data imputation has been a long-standing
research topic and critical application for real-world intelligent transportation systems.
A widely applied imputation method is low-rank matrix/tensor completion; however, the low-rank
assumption only preserves the global structure while ignores the strong local consistency in spatiotemporal
data. In this paper, we propose a low-rank autoregressive tensor completion (LATC) framework by
introducing \textit{temporal variation} as a new regularization term into the completion of a
third-order (sensor $\times$ time of day $\times$ day) tensor. The third-order tensor structure
allows us to better capture the global consistency of traffic data, such as the inherent seasonality
and day-to-day similarity. To achieve local consistency, we design the temporal variation by imposing
an AR($p$) model for each time series with coefficients as learnable parameters. Different from
previous spatial and temporal regularization schemes, the minimization of temporal variation
can better characterize temporal generative mechanisms beyond local smoothness, allowing us
to deal with more challenging scenarios such "blackout" missing. To solve the optimization problem
in LATC, we introduce an alternating minimization scheme that estimates the low-rank tensor and
autoregressive coefficients iteratively. We conduct extensive numerical experiments on several
real-world traffic data sets, and our results demonstrate the effectiveness of LATC in diverse
missing scenarios.

We consider the recently proposed extra-large scale massive multiple-input multiple-output
(XL-MIMO) systems, with some hundreds of antennas serving a smaller number of users. Since the array
length is of the same order as the distance to the users, the long-term fading coefficients of a given
user vary with the different antennas at the base station (BS). Thus, the signal transmitted by some
antennas might reach the user with much more power than that transmitted by some others. From a green
perspective, it is not effective to simultaneously activate hundreds or even thousands of antennas,
since the power-hungry radio frequency (RF) chains of the active antennas increase significantly
the total energy consumption. Besides, a larger number of selected antennas increases the power
required by linear processing, such as precoding matrix computation, and short-term channel estimation.
In this paper, we propose four antenna selection (AS) approaches to be deployed in XL-MIMO systems
aiming at maximizing the total energy efficiency (EE). Besides, employing some simplifying assumptions,
we derive a closed-form analytical expression for the EE of the XL-MIMO system, and propose a straightforward
iterative method to determine the optimal number of selected antennas able to maximize it. The proposed
AS schemes are based solely on long-term fading parameters, thus, the selected antennas set remains
valid for a relatively large time/frequency intervals. Comparing the results, we find that the
genetic-algorithm based AS scheme usually achieves the best EE performance, although our proposed
highest normalized received power AS scheme also achieves very promising EE performance in a simple
and straightforward way.

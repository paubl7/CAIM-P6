Under a commonly-studied "backdoor" poisoning attack against classification models, an attacker
adds a small "trigger" to a subset of the training data, such that the presence of this trigger at test
time causes the classifier to always predict some target class. It is often implicitly assumed that
the poisoned classifier is vulnerable exclusively to the adversary who possesses the trigger.
In this paper, we show empirically that this view of backdoored classifiers is fundamentally incorrect.
We demonstrate that anyone with access to the classifier, even without access to any original training
data or trigger, can construct several alternative triggers that are as effective or more so at eliciting
the target class at test time. We construct these alternative triggers by first generating adversarial
examples for a smoothed version of the classifier, created with a recent process called Denoised
Smoothing, and then extracting colors or cropped portions of adversarial images. We demonstrate
the effectiveness of our attack through extensive experiments on ImageNet and TrojAI datasets,
including a user study which demonstrates that our method allows users to easily determine the existence
of such backdoors in existing poisoned classifiers. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our alternative
triggers can in fact look entirely different from the original trigger, highlighting that the backdoor
actually learned by the classifier differs substantially from the trigger image itself. Thus,
we argue that there is no such thing as a "secret" backdoor in poisoned classifiers: poisoning a classifier
invites attacks not just by the party that possesses the trigger, but from anyone with access to the
classifier. Code is available at https://github.com/locuslab/breaking-poisoned-classifier.

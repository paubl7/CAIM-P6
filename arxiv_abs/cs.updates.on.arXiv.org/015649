Simulating the spread of infectious diseases in human communities is critical for predicting the
trajectory of an epidemic and verifying various policies to control the devastating impacts of
the outbreak. Many existing simulators are based on compartment models that divide people into
a few subsets and simulate the dynamics among those subsets using hypothesized differential equations.
However, these models lack the requisite granularity to study the effect of intelligent policies
that influence every individual in a particular way. In this work, we introduce a simulator software
capable of modeling a population structure and controlling the disease's propagation at an individualistic
level. In order to estimate the confidence of the conclusions drawn from the simulator, we employ
a comprehensive probabilistic approach where the entire population is constructed as a hierarchical
random variable. This approach makes the inferred conclusions more robust against sampling artifacts
and gives confidence bounds for decisions based on the simulation results. To showcase potential
applications, the simulator parameters are set based on the formal statistics of the COVID-19 pandemic,
and the outcome of a wide range of control measures is investigated. Furthermore, the simulator
is used as the environment of a reinforcement learning problem to find the optimal policies to control
the pandemic. The obtained experimental results indicate the simulator's adaptability and capacity
in making sound predictions and a successful policy derivation example based on real-world data.
As an exemplary application, our results show that the proposed policy discovery method can lead
to control measures that produce significantly fewer infected individuals in the population and
protect the health system against saturation.

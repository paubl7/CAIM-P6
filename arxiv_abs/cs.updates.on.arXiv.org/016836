Detecting the presence of project management anti-patterns (AP) currently requires experts on
the matter and is an expensive endeavor. Worse, experts may introduce their individual subjectivity
or bias. Using the Fire Drill AP, we first introduce a novel way to translate descriptions into detectable
AP that are comprised of arbitrary metrics and events such as logged time or maintenance activities,
which are mined from the underlying source code or issue-tracking data, thus making the description
objective as it becomes data-based. Secondly, we demonstrate a novel method to quantify and score
the deviations of real-world projects to data-based AP descriptions. Using nine real-world projects
that exhibit a Fire Drill to some degree, we show how to further enhance the translated AP. The ground
truth in these projects was extracted from two individual experts and consensus was found between
them. Our evaluation spans three kinds of pattern, where the first is purely derived from description,
the second type is enhanced by data, and the third kind is derived from data only. The Fire Drill AP
as translated from description only for either, source code- or issue-tracking-based detection,
shows weak potential of confidently detecting the presence of the anti-pattern in a project. Enriching
the AP with data from real-world projects significantly improves detection. Using patterns derived
from data only leads to almost perfect correlations of the scores with the ground truth. Some APs
share symptoms with the Fire Drill AP, and we conclude that the presence of similar patterns is most
certainly detectable. Furthermore, any pattern that can be characteristically modeled using
the proposed approach is potentially well detectable.

One of the limiting factors in training data-driven, rare-event prediction algorithms is the scarcity
of the events of interest resulting in an extreme imbalance in the data. There have been many methods
introduced in the literature for overcoming this issue; simple data manipulation through undersampling
and oversampling, utilizing cost-sensitive learning algorithms, or by generating synthetic
data points following the distribution of the existing data. While synthetic data generation has
recently received a great deal of attention, there are real challenges involved in doing so for high-dimensional
data such as multivariate time series. In this study, we explore the usefulness of the conditional
generative adversarial network (CGAN) as a means to perform data-informed oversampling in order
to balance a large dataset of multivariate time series. We utilize a flare forecasting benchmark
dataset, named SWAN-SF, and design two verification methods to both quantitatively and qualitatively
evaluate the similarity between the generated minority and the ground-truth samples. We further
assess the quality of the generated samples by training a classical, supervised machine learning
algorithm on synthetic data, and testing the trained model on the unseen, real data. The results
show that the classifier trained on the data augmented with the synthetic multivariate time series
achieves a significant improvement compared with the case where no augmentation is used. The popular
flare forecasting evaluation metrics, TSS and HSS, report 20-fold and 5-fold improvements, respectively,
indicating the remarkable statistical similarities, and the usefulness of CGAN-based data generation
for complicated tasks such as flare forecasting.

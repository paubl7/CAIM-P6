Energy disaggregation or nonintrusive load monitoring (NILM), is a single-input blind source
discrimination problem, aims to interpret the mains user electricity consumption into appliance
level measurement. This article presents a new approach for power disaggregation by using a deep
recurrent long short term memory (LSTM) network combined with convolutional neural networks (CNN).
Deep neural networks have been shown to be a significant way for these types of problems because of
their complexity and huge number of trainable paramters. Hybrid method that proposed in the article
could significantly increase the overall accuracy of NILM because it benefits from both network
advantages. The proposed method used sequence-to-sequence learning, where the input is a window
of the mains and the output is a window of the target appliance. The proposed deep neural network approach
has been applied to real-world household energy dataset "REFIT". The REFIT electrical load measurements
dataset described in this paper includes whole house aggregate loads and nine individual appliance
measurements at 8-second intervals per house, collected continuously over a period of two years
from 20 houses around the UK. The proposed method achieve significant performance, improving accuracy
and F1-score measures by 95.93% and 80.93% ,respectively which demonstrates the effectiveness
and superiority of the proposed approach for home energy monitoring. Comparison of proposed method
and other recently published method has been presented and discussed based on accuracy, number
of considered appliances and size of the deep neural network trainable parameters. The proposed
method shows remarkable performance compare to other previous methods.

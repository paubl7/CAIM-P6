Fine-grained image recognition is challenging because discriminative clues are usually fragmented,
whether from a single image or multiple images. Despite their significant improvements, most existing
methods still focus on the most discriminative parts from a single image, ignoring informative
details in other regions and lacking consideration of clues from other associated images. In this
paper, we analyze the difficulties of fine-grained image recognition from a new perspective and
propose a transformer architecture with the peak suppression module and knowledge guidance module,
which respects the diversification of discriminative features in a single image and the aggregation
of discriminative clues among multiple images. Specifically, the peak suppression module first
utilizes a linear projection to convert the input image into sequential tokens. It then blocks the
token based on the attention response generated by the transformer encoder. This module penalizes
the attention to the most discriminative parts in the feature learning process, therefore, enhancing
the information exploitation of the neglected regions. The knowledge guidance module compares
the image-based representation generated from the peak suppression module with the learnable
knowledge embedding set to obtain the knowledge response coefficients. Afterwards, it formalizes
the knowledge learning as a classification problem using response coefficients as the classification
scores. Knowledge embeddings and image-based representations are updated during training so
that the knowledge embedding includes discriminative clues for different images. Finally, we
incorporate the acquired knowledge embeddings into the image-based representations as comprehensive
representations, leading to significantly higher performance. Extensive evaluations on the
six popular datasets demonstrate the advantage of the proposed method.

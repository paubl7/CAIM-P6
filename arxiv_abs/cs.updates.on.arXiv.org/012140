We study a family of $H^m$-conforming piecewise polynomials based on artificial neural network,
named as the finite neuron method (FNM), for numerical solution of $2m$-th order partial differential
equations in $\mathbb{R}^d$ for any $m,d \geq 1$ and then provide convergence analysis for this
method. Given a general domain $\Omega\subset\mathbb R^d$ and a partition $\mathcal T_h$ of $\Omega$,
it is still an open problem in general how to construct conforming finite element subspace of $H^m(\Omega)$
that have adequate approximation properties. By using techniques from artificial neural networks,
we construct a family of $H^m$-conforming set of functions consisting of piecewise polynomials
of degree $k$ for any $k\ge m$ and we further obtain the error estimate when they are applied to solve
elliptic boundary value problem of any order in any dimension. For example, the following error
estimates between the exact solution $u$ and finite neuron approximation $u_N$ are obtained. $$
\|u-u_N\|_{H^m(\Omega)}=\mathcal O(N^{-{1\over 2}-{1\over d}}). $$ Discussions will also
be given on the difference and relationship between the finite neuron method and finite element
methods (FEM). For example, for finite neuron method, the underlying finite element grids are not
given a priori and the discrete solution can only be obtained by solving a non-linear and non-convex
optimization problem. Despite of many desirable theoretical properties of the finite neuron method
analyzed in the paper, its practical value is a subject of further investigation since the aforementioned
underlying non-linear and non-convex optimization problem can be expensive and challenging to
solve. For completeness and also convenience to readers, some basic known results and their proofs
are also included in this manuscript.

Timeline-based planning is an approach originally developed in the context of space mission planning
and scheduling, where problem domains are modelled as systems made of a number of independent but
interacting components, whose behaviour over time, the timelines, is governed by a set of temporal
constraints. This approach is different from the action-based perspective of common PDDL-like
planning languages. Timeline-based systems have been successfully deployed in a number of space
missions and other domains. However, despite this practical success, a thorough theoretical understanding
of the paradigm was missing. This thesis fills this gap, providing the first detailed account of
formal and computational properties of the timeline-based approach to planning. In particular,
we show that a particularly restricted variant of the formalism is already expressive enough to
compactly capture action-based temporal planning problems. Then, finding a solution plan for
a timeline-based planning problem is proved to be EXPSPACE-complete. Then, we study the problem
of timeline-based planning with uncertainty, that include external components whose behaviour
is not under the control of the planned system. We identify a few issues in the state-of-the-art approach
based on flexible plans, proposing timeline-based games, a more general game-theoretic formulation
of the problem, that addresses those issues. We show that winning strategies for such games can be
found in doubly-exponential time. Then, we study the expressiveness of the formalism from a logic
point of view, showing that (most of) timeline-based planning problems can be captured by Bounded
TPTL with Past, a fragment of TPTL+P that, unlike the latter, keeps an EXPSPACE satisfiability problem.
The logic is introduced and its satisfiabilty problem is solved by extending a recent one-pass tree-shaped
tableau method for LTL.

This thesis serves three primary purposes, first of which is to forecast two stocks, i.e. Goldman
Sachs (GS) and General Electric (GE). In order to forecast stock prices, we used a long short-term
memory (LSTM) model in which we inputted the prices of two other stocks that lie in rather close correlation
with GS. Other models such as ARIMA were used as benchmark. Empirical results manifest the practical
challenges when using LSTM for forecasting stocks. One of the main upheavals was a recurring lag
which we called "forecasting lag". The second purpose is to develop a more general and objective
perspective on the task of time series forecasting so that it could be applied to assist in an arbitrary
that of forecasting by ANNs. Thus, attempts are made for distinguishing previous works by certain
criteria so as to summarise those including effective information. The summarised information
is then unified and expressed through a common terminology that can be applied to different steps
of a time series forecasting task. The last but not least purpose of this thesis is to elaborate on
a mathematical framework on which ANNs are based. We are going to use the framework introduced in
the book "Neural Networks in Mathematical Framework" by Anthony L. Caterini in which the structure
of a generic neural network is introduced and the gradient descent algorithm (which incorporates
backpropagation) is introduced in terms of their described framework. In the end, we use this framework
for a specific architecture, which is recurrent neural networks on which we concentrated and our
implementations are based. The book proves its theorems mostly for classification case. Instead,
we proved theorems for regression case, which is the case of our problem.

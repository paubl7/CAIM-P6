Protecting privileged communications and data from disclosure is paramount for legal teams. Legal
advice, such as attorney-client communications or litigation strategy are typically exempt from
disclosure in litigations or regulatory events and are vital to the attorney-client relationship.
To protect this information from disclosure, companies and outside counsel often review vast amounts
of documents to determine those that contain privileged material. This process is extremely costly
and time consuming. As data volumes increase, legal counsel normally employs methods to reduce
the number of documents requiring review while balancing the need to ensure the protection of privileged
information. Keyword searching is relied upon as a method to target privileged information and
reduce document review populations. Keyword searches are effective at casting a wide net but often
return overly inclusive results - most of which do not contain privileged information. To overcome
the weaknesses of keyword searching, legal teams increasingly are using machine learning techniques
to target privileged information. In these studies, classic text classification techniques are
applied to build classification models to identify privileged documents. In this paper, the authors
propose a different method by applying machine learning / convolutional neural network techniques
(CNN) to identify privileged documents. Our proposed method combines keyword searching with CNN.
For each keyword term, a CNN model is created using the context of the occurrences of the keyword.
In addition, a method was proposed to select reliable privileged (positive) training keyword occurrences
from labeled positive training documents. Extensive experiments were conducted, and the results
show that the proposed methods can significantly reduce false positives while still capturing
most of the true positives.

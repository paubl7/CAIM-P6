Edge computing enabled smart greenhouse is a representative application of Internet of Things
technology, which can monitor the environmental information in real time and employ the information
to contribute to intelligent decision-making. In the process, anomaly detection for wireless
sensor data plays an important role. However, traditional anomaly detection algorithms originally
designed for anomaly detection in static data have not properly considered the inherent characteristics
of data stream produced by wireless sensor such as infiniteness, correlations and concept drift,
which may pose a considerable challenge on anomaly detection based on data stream, and lead to low
detection accuracy and efficiency. First, data stream usually generates quickly which means that
it is infinite and enormous, so any traditional off-line anomaly detection algorithm that attempts
to store the whole dataset or to scan the dataset multiple times for anomaly detection will run out
of memory space. Second, there exist correlations among different data streams, which traditional
algorithms hardly consider. Third, the underlying data generation process or data distribution
may change over time. Thus, traditional anomaly detection algorithms with no model update will
lose their effects. Considering these issues, a novel method (called DLSHiForest) on basis of Locality-Sensitive
Hashing and time window technique in this paper is proposed to solve these problems while achieving
accurate and efficient detection. Comprehensive experiments are executed using real-world agricultural
greenhouse dataset to demonstrate the feasibility of our approach. Experimental results show
that our proposal is practicable in addressing challenges of traditional anomaly detection while
ensuring accuracy and efficiency.

The SEIR model, widely used for analyzing and predicting the spread of virus infection, is here extended
to considering the movement of people across regions. In contrast to previous models considering
the risk due to the travelers from/to other regions, here we consider two factors. First, we consider
the movements of susceptible (S), exposed (E), and recovered (R) individuals who may get infected
after movement, as well as infected (I). Second, the infectious contacts between people from different
regions are dealt with separately from the first factor. By this, we can reflect the potential future
influence on the infection spread due to the movements of S and E that are hard to detect by the infection
test at the time of immigration. As a result, we show the results of simulation where the influence
of traveling across regions, which mean prefectures here, and of the choice of regions to vaccinate
with priority, on the risk of infection spread. We find the regions of large population or large effective
regeneration number should be vaccinated with priority and that frequent travels tend to cause
an influence to enhance the spread especially in the uptrend stage of infections and in regions of
smaller populations. Moreover, we show vaccination at a slow pace in Japan will not suppress the
infection spread sufficiently to extinguish the current 4th wave within a few months. However,
a restricted quantity of vaccines can be used efficiently by maximizing a diverted index value ?
the conditional entropy ? of vaccination distribution. Furthermore, travel activity across regional
borders that accelerated infection spread so far is found to rather sup-press it if vaccination
is processed at a high pace.

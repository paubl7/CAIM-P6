Recently, segmentation methods based on Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) showed promising
performance in automatic Multiple Sclerosis (MS) lesions segmentation. These techniques have
even outperformed human experts in controlled evaluation condition. However state-of-the-art
approaches trained to perform well on highly-controlled datasets fail to generalize on clinical
data from unseen datasets. Instead of proposing another improvement of the segmentation accuracy,
we propose a novel method robust to domain shift and performing well on unseen datasets, called DeepLesionBrain
(DLB). This generalization property results from three main contributions. First, DLB is based
on a large ensemble of compact 3D CNNs. This ensemble strategy ensures a robust prediction despite
the risk of generalization failure of some individual networks. Second, DLB includes a new image
quality data augmentation to reduce dependency to training data specificity (e.g., acquisition
protocol). Finally, to learn a more generalizable representation of MS lesions, we propose a hierarchical
specialization learning (HSL). HSL is performed by pre-training a generic network over the whole
brain, before using its weights as initialization to locally specialized networks. By this end,
DLB learns both generic features extracted at global image level and specific features extracted
at local image level. At the time of publishing this paper, DLB is among the Top 3 performing published
methods on ISBI Challenge while using only half of the available modalities. DLB generalization
has also been compared to other state-of-the-art approaches, during cross-dataset experiments
on MSSEG'16, ISBI challenge, and in-house datasets. DLB improves the segmentation performance
and generalization over classical techniques, and thus proposes a robust approach better suited
for clinical practice.

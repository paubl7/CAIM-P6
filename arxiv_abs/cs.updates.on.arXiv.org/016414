Many processes in psychology are complex, such as dyadic interactions between two interacting
partners (e.g. patient-therapist, intimate relationship partners). Nevertheless, many basic
questions about interactions are difficult to investigate because dyadic processes can be within
a person and between partners, they are based on multimodal aspects of behavior and unfold rapidly.
Current analyses are mainly based on the behavioral coding method, whereby human coders annotate
behavior based on a coding schema. But coding is labor-intensive, expensive, slow, focuses on few
modalities. Current approaches in psychology use LIWC for analyzing couples' interactions. However,
advances in natural language processing such as BERT could enable the development of systems to
potentially automate behavioral coding, which in turn could substantially improve psychological
research. In this work, we train machine learning models to automatically predict positive and
negative communication behavioral codes of 368 German-speaking Swiss couples during an 8-minute
conflict interaction on a fine-grained scale (10-seconds sequences) using linguistic features
and paralinguistic features derived with openSMILE. Our results show that both simpler TF-IDF
features as well as more complex BERT features performed better than LIWC, and that adding paralinguistic
features did not improve the performance. These results suggest it might be time to consider modern
alternatives to LIWC, the de facto linguistic features in psychology, for prediction tasks in couples
research. This work is a further step towards the automated coding of couples' behavior which could
enhance couple research and therapy, and be utilized for other dyadic interactions as well.

To improve the viewer's quality of experience and optimize processing systems in computer graphics
applications, the 3D quality assessment (3D-QA) has become an important task in the multimedia
area. Point cloud and mesh are the two most widely used electronic representation formats of 3D models,
the quality of which is quite sensitive to operations like simplification and compression. Therefore,
many studies concerning point cloud quality assessment (PCQA) and mesh quality assessment (MQA)
have been carried out to measure the visual quality degradations caused by lossy operations. However,
a large part of previous studies utilizes full-reference (FR) metrics, which means they may fail
to predict the accurate quality level of 3D models when the reference 3D model is not available. Furthermore,
limited numbers of 3D-QA metrics are carried out to take color features into consideration, which
significantly restricts the effectiveness and scope of application. In many quality assessment
studies, natural scene statistics (NSS) have shown a good ability to quantify the distortion of
natural scenes to statistical parameters. Therefore, we propose an NSS-based no-reference quality
assessment metric for colored 3D models. In this paper, quality-aware features are extracted from
the aspects of color and geometry directly from the 3D models. Then the statistic parameters are
estimated using different distribution models to describe the characteristic of the 3D models.
Our method is mainly validated on the colored point cloud quality assessment database (SJTU-PCQA)
and the colored mesh quality assessment database (CMDM). The experimental results show that the
proposed method outperforms all the state-of-art NR 3D-QA metrics and obtains an acceptable gap
with the state-of-art FR 3D-QA metrics.

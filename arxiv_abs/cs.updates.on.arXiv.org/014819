Recommender systems rely heavily on increasing computation resources to improve their business
goal. By deploying computation-intensive models and algorithms, these systems are able to inference
user interests and exhibit certain ads or commodities from the candidate set to maximize their business
goals. However, such systems are facing two challenges in achieving their goals. On the one hand,
facing massive online requests, computation-intensive models and algorithms are pushing their
computation resources to the limit. On the other hand, the response time of these systems is strictly
limited to a short period, e.g. 300 milliseconds in our real system, which is also being exhausted
by the increasingly complex models and algorithms. In this paper, we propose the computation resource
allocation solution (CRAS) that maximizes the business goal with limited computation resources
and response time. We comprehensively illustrate the problem and formulate such a problem as an
optimization problem with multiple constraints, which could be broken down into independent sub-problems.
To solve the sub-problems, we propose the revenue function to facilitate the theoretical analysis,
and obtain the optimal computation resource allocation strategy. To address the applicability
issues, we devise the feedback control system to help our strategy constantly adapt to the changing
online environment. The effectiveness of our method is verified by extensive experiments based
on the real dataset from Taobao.com. We also deploy our method in the display advertising system
of Alibaba. The online results show that our computation resource allocation solution achieves
significant business goal improvement without any increment of computation cost, which demonstrates
the efficacy of our method in real industrial practice.

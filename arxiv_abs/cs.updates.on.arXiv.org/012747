Given a graph property $\Phi$, we consider the problem $\mathtt{EdgeSub}(\Phi)$, where the input
is a pair of a graph $G$ and a positive integer $k$, and the task is to decide whether $G$ contains a $k$-edge
subgraph that satisfies $\Phi$. Specifically, we study the parameterized complexity of $\mathtt{EdgeSub}(\Phi)$
and of its counting problem $\#\mathtt{EdgeSub}(\Phi)$ with respect to both approximate and exact
counting. We obtain a complete picture for minor-closed properties $\Phi$: the decision problem
$\mathtt{EdgeSub}(\Phi)$ always admits an FPT algorithm and the counting problem $\#\mathtt{EdgeSub}(\Phi)$
always admits an FPTRAS. For exact counting, we present an exhaustive and explicit criterion on
the property $\Phi$ which, if satisfied, yields fixed-parameter tractability and otherwise $\#\mathsf{W[1]}$-hardness.
Additionally, most of our hardness results come with an almost tight conditional lower bound under
the so-called Exponential Time Hypothesis, ruling out algorithms for $\#\mathtt{EdgeSub}(\Phi)$
that run in time $f(k)\cdot|G|^{o(k/\log k)}$ for any computable function $f$. As a main technical
result, we gain a complete understanding of the coefficients of toroidal grids and selected Cayley
graph expanders in the homomorphism basis of $\#\mathtt{EdgeSub}(\Phi)$. This allows us to establish
hardness of exact counting using the Complexity Monotonicity framework due to Curticapean, Dell
and Marx (STOC'17). Our methods can also be applied to a parameterized variant of the Tutte Polynomial
$T^k_G$ of a graph $G$, to which many known combinatorial interpretations of values of the (classical)
Tutte Polynomial can be extended. As an example, $T^k_G(2,1)$ corresponds to the number of $k$-forests
in the graph $G$. Our techniques allow us to completely understand the parametrized complexity
of computing the evaluation of $T^k_G$ at every pair of rational coordinates $(x,y)$.

Bayesian persuasion is the study of information sharing policies among strategic agents. A prime
example is signaling in online ad auctions: what information should a platform signal to an advertiser
regarding a user when selling the opportunity to advertise to her? Practical considerations such
as preventing discrimination, protecting privacy or acknowledging limited attention of the information
receiver impose constraints on information sharing. In this work, we propose and analyze a simple
way to mathematically model such constraints as restrictions on Receiver's admissible posterior
beliefs. We consider two families of constraints - ex ante and ex post, where the latter limits each
instance of Sender-Receiver communication, while the former more general family can also pose
restrictions in expectation. For the ex ante family, Doval and Skreta establish the existence of
an optimal signaling scheme with a small number of signals - at most the number of constraints plus
the number of states of nature; we show this result is tight and provide an alternative proof for it.
For the ex post family, we tighten a bound of V{\o}lund, showing that the required number of signals
is at most the number of states of nature, as in the original Kamenica-Gentzkow setting. As our main
algorithmic result, we provide an additive bi-criteria FPTAS for an optimal constrained signaling
scheme assuming a constant number of states; we improve the approximation to single-criteria under
a Slater-like regularity condition. The FPTAS holds under standard assumptions; relaxed assumptions
yield a PTAS. Finally, we bound the ratio between Sender's optimal utility under convex ex ante constraints
and the corresponding ex post constraints. This bound applies to finding an approximately welfare-maximizing
constrained signaling scheme in ad auctions.

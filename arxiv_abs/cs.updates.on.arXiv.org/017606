Curvelet frame is of special significance for photoacoustic tomography (PAT) due to its sparsifying
and microlocalisation properties. We derive a one-to-one map between wavefront directions in
image and data spaces in PAT which suggests near equivalence between the recovery of the initial
pressure and PAT data from compressed/subsampled measurements when assuming sparsity in Curvelet
frame. As the latter is computationally more tractable, investigation to which extent this equivalence
holds conducted in this paper is of immediate practical significance. To this end we formulate and
compare DR, a two step approach based on the recovery of the complete volume of the photoacoustic
data from the subsampled data followed by the acoustic inversion, and p0R, a one step approach where
the photoacoustic image (the initial pressure, p0) is directly recovered from the subsampled data.
Effective representation of the photoacoustic data requires basis defined on the range of the photoacoustic
forward operator. To this end we propose a novel wedge-restriction of Curvelet transform which
enables us to construct such basis. Both recovery problems are formulated in a variational framework.
As the Curvelet frame is heavily overdetermined, we use reweighted l1 norm penalties to enhance
the sparsity of the solution. The data reconstruction problem DR is a standard compressed sensing
recovery problem, which we solve using an ADMMtype algorithm, SALSA. Subsequently, the initial
pressure is recovered using time reversal as implemented in the k-Wave Toolbox. The p0 reconstruction
problem, p0R, aims to recover the photoacoustic image directly via FISTA, or ADMM when in addition
including a non-negativity constraint. We compare and discuss the relative merits of the two approaches
and illustrate them on 2D simulated and 3D real data in a fair and rigorous manner.

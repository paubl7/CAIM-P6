Creating bilingual dictionary is the first crucial step in enriching low-resource languages.
Especially for the closely-related ones, it has been shown that the constraint-based approach
is useful for inducing bilingual lexicons from two bilingual dictionaries via the pivot language.
However, if there are no available machine-readable dictionaries as input, we need to consider
manual creation by bilingual native speakers. To reach a goal of comprehensively create multiple
bilingual dictionaries, even if we already have several existing machine-readable bilingual
dictionaries, it is still difficult to determine the execution order of the constraint-based approach
to reducing the total cost. Plan optimization is crucial in composing the order of bilingual dictionaries
creation with the consideration of the methods and their costs. We formalize the plan optimization
for creating bilingual dictionaries by utilizing Markov Decision Process (MDP) with the goal to
get a more accurate estimation of the most feasible optimal plan with the least total cost before
fully implementing the constraint-based bilingual lexicon induction. We model a prior beta distribution
of bilingual lexicon induction precision with language similarity and polysemy of the topology
as $\alpha$ and $\beta$ parameters. It is further used to model cost function and state transition
probability. We estimated the cost of all investment plan as a baseline for evaluating the proposed
MDP-based approach with total cost as an evaluation metric. After utilizing the posterior beta
distribution in the first batch of experiments to construct the prior beta distribution in the second
batch of experiments, the result shows 61.5\% of cost reduction compared to the estimated all investment
plan and 39.4\% of cost reduction compared to the estimated MDP optimal plan. The MDP-based proposal
outperformed the baseline on the total cost.

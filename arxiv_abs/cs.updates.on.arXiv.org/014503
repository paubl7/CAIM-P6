This paper proposes an online decentralized channel allocation scheme based on contextual multi-armed
bandit (CMAB) learning in a densely deployed wireless local area network (WLAN) environment. The
communication quality in WLANs is significantly affected by the carrier sense relationship between
access points (APs) and the channel. To the best of our knowledge, conventional MAB-based channel
allocation schemes dedicated to WLANs do not use any information other than the observed reward
for learning. Therefore, we aim to validate the effectiveness of prior information (i.e., the channels
of neighboring APs) in improving the system throughput. To this end, we propose contention-driven
feature extraction (CDFE), which leverages the channels of neighboring APs to extract features
corresponding to the adjacency relation of the contention graph. CMAB learning with CDFE enables
each AP to distinguish the impact of neighboring APs on the observed throughput. Furthermore, we
address the problem of non-convergence -- the channel allocation cycle -- which is an inherent difficulty
in selfish decentralized learning. To prevent such a cycle, we propose a penalized JointLinUCB
(P-JLinUCB) based on the key idea of introducing a discount parameter to the reward of exploiting
a different channel before and after the learning round. To incorporate the effect of this discounted
reward into a linear model, we also add a penalty term to the feature vector. A numerical evaluation
indicates that CMAB-based channel allocation using CDFE improves the system throughput. Moreover,
the proposed P-JLinUCB significantly reduces the number of channel adjustments, i.e., prevents
cycles, without degrading the system throughput.

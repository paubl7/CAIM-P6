To verify safety and robustness of neural networks, researchers have successfully applied abstract
interpretation, primarily using the interval abstract domain. In this paper, we study the theoretical
power and limits of the interval domain for neural-network verification. First, we introduce the
interval universal approximation (IUA) theorem. IUA shows that neural networks not only can approximate
any continuous function $f$ (universal approximation) as we have known for decades, but we can find
a neural network, using any well-behaved activation function, whose interval bounds are an arbitrarily
close approximation of the set semantics of $f$ (the result of applying $f$ to a set of inputs). We
call this notion of approximation interval approximation. Our theorem generalizes the recent
result of Baader et al. (2020) from ReLUs to a rich class of activation functions that we call squashable
functions. Additionally, the IUA theorem implies that we can always construct provably robust
neural networks under $\ell_\infty$-norm using almost any practical activation function. Second,
we study the computational complexity of constructing neural networks that are amenable to precise
interval analysis. This is a crucial question, as our constructive proof of IUA is exponential in
the size of the approximation domain. We boil this question down to the problem of approximating
the range of a neural network with squashable activation functions. We show that the range approximation
problem (RA) is a $\Delta_2$-intermediate problem, which is strictly harder than $\mathsf{NP}$-complete
problems, assuming $\mathsf{coNP}\not\subset \mathsf{NP}$. As a result, IUA is an inherently
hard problem: No matter what abstract domain or computational tools we consider to achieve interval
approximation, there is no efficient construction of such a universal approximator.

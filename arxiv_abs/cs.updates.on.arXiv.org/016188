Pelvic ring disruptions result from blunt injury mechanisms and are often found in patients with
multi-system trauma. To grade pelvic fracture severity in trauma victims based on whole-body CT,
the Tile AO/OTA classification is frequently used. Due to the high volume of whole-body trauma CTs
generated in busy trauma centers, an automated approach to Tile classification would provide substantial
value, e.,g., to prioritize the reading queue of the attending trauma radiologist. In such scenario,
an automated method should perform grading based on a transparent process and based on interpretable
features to enable interaction with human readers and lower their workload by offering insights
from a first automated read of the scan. This paper introduces an automated yet interpretable pelvic
trauma decision support system to assist radiologists in fracture detection and Tile grade classification.
The method operates similarly to human interpretation of CT scans and first detects distinct pelvic
fractures on CT with high specificity using a Faster-RCNN model that are then interpreted using
a structural causal model based on clinical best practices to infer an initial Tile grade. The Bayesian
causal model and finally, the object detector are then queried for likely co-occurring fractures
that may have been rejected initially due to the highly specific operating point of the detector,
resulting in an updated list of detected fractures and corresponding final Tile grade. Our method
is transparent in that it provides finding location and type using the object detector, as well as
information on important counterfactuals that would invalidate the system's recommendation
and achieves an AUC of 83.3%/85.1% for translational/rotational instability. Despite being designed
for human-machine teaming, our approach does not compromise on performance compared to previous
black-box approaches.

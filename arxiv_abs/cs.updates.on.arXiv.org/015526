We study the fair division problem on divisible heterogeneous resources (the cake cutting problem)
with strategic agents, where each agent can manipulate his/her private valuation in order to receive
a better allocation. A (direct-revelation) mechanism takes agents' reported valuations as input,
and outputs an allocation that satisfies a given fairness requirement. A natural and fundamental
open problem, first raised by [Chen et al., 2010] and subsequently raised by [Procaccia, 2013] [Aziz
and Ye, 2014] [Branzei and Miltersen, 2015] [Menon and Larson, 2017] [Bei et al., 2017] [Bei et al.,
2020], etc., is whether there exists a deterministic, truthful and envy-free (or even proportional)
cake cutting mechanism. In this paper, we resolve this open problem by proving that there does not
exist a deterministic, truthful and proportional cake cutting mechanism, even in the special case
where all of the followings hold: 1. there are only two agents; 2. each agent's valuation is a piecewise-constant
function; 3. each agent is hungry: each agent has a strictly positive value on any part of the cake.
The impossibility result extends to the case where the mechanism is allowed to leave some part of
the cake unallocated. To circumvent this impossibility result, we aim to design mechanisms that
possess certain degree of truthfulness. Motivated by the kind of truthfulness possessed by the
classical I-cut-you-choose protocol, we define a weaker notion of truthfulness: the risk-averse
truthfulness. We show that the well-known moving-knife procedure and Even-Paz algorithm do not
have this truthful property. We propose a mechanism that is risk-averse truthful and envy-free,
and a mechanism that is risk-averse truthful and proportional that always outputs allocations
with connected pieces.

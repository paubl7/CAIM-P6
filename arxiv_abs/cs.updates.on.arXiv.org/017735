Handwritten character recognition (HCR) is a challenging learning problem in pattern recognition,
mainly due to similarity in structure of characters, different handwriting styles, noisy datasets
and a large variety of languages and scripts. HCR problem is studied extensively for a few decades
but there is very limited research on script independent models. This is because of factors, like,
diversity of scripts, focus of the most of conventional research efforts on handcrafted feature
extraction techniques which are language/script specific and are not always available, and unavailability
of public datasets and codes to reproduce the results. On the other hand, deep learning has witnessed
huge success in different areas of pattern recognition, including HCR, and provides end-to-end
learning, i.e., automated feature extraction and recognition. In this paper, we have proposed
a novel deep learning architecture which exploits transfer learning and image-augmentation for
end-to-end learning for script independent handwritten character recognition, called HCR-Net.
The network is based on a novel transfer learning approach for HCR, where some of lower layers of a
pre-trained VGG16 network are utilised. Due to transfer learning and image-augmentation, HCR-Net
provides faster training, better performance and better generalisations. The experimental results
on publicly available datasets of Bangla, Punjabi, Hindi, English, Swedish, Urdu, Farsi, Tibetan,
Kannada, Malayalam, Telugu, Marathi, Nepali and Arabic languages prove the efficacy of HCR-Net
and establishes several new benchmarks. For reproducibility of the results and for the advancements
of the HCR research, complete code is publicly released at \href{https://github.com/jmdvinodjmd/HCR-Net}{GitHub}.

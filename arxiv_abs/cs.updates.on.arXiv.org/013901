Privacy is essential in data trading markets. This work uses a mechanism design approach to study
the data buyer's optimal data market model with differential privacy. Motivated by the discovery
of individuals' dual motives for privacy protection, we consider that each data owner privately
possesses an intrinsic motive and an instrumental motive. We study optimal market design in a dynamic
environment by determining the privacy assignment rule that specifies the privacy protection
at each data usage and the payment rules to compensate for the privacy loss when the owners' instrumental
motive is endogenously dynamic due to the buyer's dynamic activities. Due to the privacy-utility
tradeoff of differential privacy, privacy loss is inevitable when data is traded with privacy protection.
To mitigate the risk of uncertainties, we allow the owners to leave the market using optimal stopping
time if the accumulated privacy loss is beyond their privacy budgets that depend on their intrinsic
motives. In order to influence the data owners' stopping decisions, the data buyer uses a stopping
payment rule that is independent of the data owners' preferences and specifies a monetary transfer
to a data owner only at the period when he decides to stop at the end of that period. We introduce the
notion of dynamic incentive compatibility to capture the joint deviations from optimal stopping
and truthful reporting. Under a monotonicity assumption about the dynamics, the optimal stopping
rule can be formulated as a threshold-based rule. A design principle is provided by a sufficient
condition of dynamic incentive compatibility. We relax the buyer's optimal market design by characterizing
the monetary transfer rules in terms of privacy assignment rules and the threshold functions. To
address the analytical intractability, we provide a sufficient condition for a relaxed dynamic
incentive-compatible model.

Several more and more efficient component--by--component (CBC) constructions for suitable rank-1
lattices were developed during the last decades. On the one hand, there exist constructions that
are based on minimizing some error functional. On the other hand, there is the possibility to construct
rank-1 lattices whose corresponding cubature rule exactly integrates all elements within a space
of multivariate trigonometric polynomials. In this paper, we focus on the second approach, i.e.,
the exactness of rank-1 lattice rules. The main contribution is the analysis of a probabilistic
version of an already known algorithm that realizes a CBC construction of such rank-1 lattices.
It turns out that the computational effort of the known deterministic algorithm can be considerably
improved in average by means of a simple randomization. Moreover, we give a detailed analysis of
the computational costs with respect to a certain failure probability, which then leads to the development
of a probabilistic CBC algorithm. In particular, the presented approach will be highly beneficial
for the construction of so-called reconstructing rank-1 lattices, that are practically relevant
for function approximation. Subsequent to the rigorous analysis of the presented CBC algorithms,
we present an algorithm that determines reconstructing rank-1 lattices of reasonable lattice
sizes with high probability. We provide estimates on the resulting lattice sizes and bounds on the
occurring failure probability. Furthermore, we discuss the computational complexity of the presented
algorithm. Various numerical tests illustrate the efficiency of the presented algorithms. Among
others, we demonstrate how to exploit the efficiency of our algorithm even for the construction
of exactly integrating rank-1 lattices, provided that a certain property of the treated space of
trigonometric polynomials is known.

In this work, Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) and Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) methodologies
are applied to hydroacoustic dataset computed using Large Eddy Simulation (LES) coupled with Ffowcs
Williams and Hawkings (FWH) analogy. First, a low-dimensional description of the flow fields is
presented with modal decomposition analysis. Sensitivity towards the DMD and POD bases truncation
rank is discussed, and extensive dataset is provided to demonstrate the ability of both algorithms
to reconstruct the flow fields with all the spatial and temporal frequencies necessary to support
accurate noise evaluation. Results show that while DMD is capable to capture finer coherent structures
in the wake region for the same amount of employed modes, reconstructed flow fields using POD exhibit
smaller magnitudes of global spatiotemporal errors compared with DMD counterparts. Second, a
separate set of DMD and POD modes generated using half the snapshots is employed into two data-driven
reduced models respectively, based on DMD mid cast and POD with Interpolation (PODI). In that regard,
results confirm that the predictive character of both reduced approaches on the flow fields is sufficiently
accurate, with a relative superiority of PODI results over DMD ones. This infers that, discrepancies
induced due to interpolation errors in PODI is relatively low compared with errors induced by integration
and linear regression operations in DMD, for the present setup. Finally, a post processing analysis
on the evaluation of FWH acoustic signals utilizing reduced fluid dynamic fields as input demonstrates
that both DMD and PODI data-driven reduced models are efficient and sufficiently accurate in predicting
acoustic noises.

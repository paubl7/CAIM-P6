This study proposes a data-driven method that detects cable damage from measured cable forces by
recognizing biased patterns from the intact conditions. The proposed method solves the pattern
recognition problem for cable damage detection through time series classification (TSC) in deep
learning, considering that the cable's behavior can be implicitly represented by the measured
cable force series. A deep learning model, long short term memory fully convolutional network (LSTM-FCN),
is leveraged by assigning appropriate inputs and representative class labels for the TSC problem,
First, a TSC classifier is trained and validated using the data collected under intact conditions
of stay cables, setting the segmented data series as input and the cable (or cable pair) ID as class
labels. Subsequently, the classifier is tested using the data collected under possible damaged
conditions. Finally, the cable or cable pair corresponding to the least classification accuracy
is recommended as the most probable damaged cable or cable pair. The proposed method was tested on
an in-service cable-stayed bridge with damaged stay cables. Two scenarios in the proposed TSC scheme
were investigated: 1) raw time series of cable forces were fed into the classifiers; and 2) cable
force ratios were inputted in the classifiers considering the possible variation of force distribution
between cable pairs due to cable damage. Combining the results of TSC testing in these two scenarios,
the cable with rupture was correctly identified. This study proposes a data-driven methodology
for cable damage detection that requires the least data preprocessing and feature engineering,
which enables fast and convenient early detection in real applications.

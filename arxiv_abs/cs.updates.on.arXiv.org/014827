The Social Internet of Things (SIoT), integration of the Internet of Things and Social Networks
paradigms, has been introduced to build a network of smart nodes that are capable of establishing
social links. In order to deal with misbehaving service provider nodes, service requestor nodes
must evaluate their trustworthiness levels. In this paper, we propose a novel trust management
mechanism in the SIoT to predict the most reliable service providers for each service requestor,
which leads to reduce the risk of being exposed to malicious nodes. We model the SIoT with a flexible
bipartite graph (containing two sets of nodes: service providers and service requestors), then
build a social network among the service requestor nodes, using the Hellinger distance. Afterward,
we develop a social trust model using nodes' centrality and similarity measures to extract trust
behaviors among the social network nodes. Finally, a matrix factorization technique is designed
to extract latent features of SIoT nodes, find trustworthy nodes, and mitigate the data sparsity
and cold start problems. We analyze the effect of parameters in the proposed trust prediction mechanism
on prediction accuracy. The results indicate that feedbacks from the neighboring nodes of a specific
service requestor with high Hellinger similarity in our mechanism outperforms the best existing
methods. We also show that utilizing the social trust model, which only considers a similarity measure,
significantly improves the accuracy of the prediction mechanism. Furthermore, we evaluate the
effectiveness of the proposed trust management system through a real-world SIoT use case. Our results
demonstrate that the proposed mechanism is resilient to different types of network attacks, and
it can accurately find the most proper and trustworthy service provider.

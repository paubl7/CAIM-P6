Prevention of stroke with its associated risk factors has been one of the public health priorities
worldwide. Emerging artificial intelligence technology is being increasingly adopted to predict
stroke. Because of privacy concerns, patient data are stored in distributed electronic health
record (EHR) databases, voluminous clinical datasets, which prevent patient data from being aggregated
and restrains AI technology to boost the accuracy of stroke prediction with centralized training
data. In this work, our scientists and engineers propose a privacy-preserving scheme to predict
the risk of stroke and deploy our federated prediction model on cloud servers. Our system of federated
prediction model asynchronously supports any number of client connections and arbitrary local
gradient iterations in each communication round. It adopts federated averaging during the model
training process, without patient data being taken out of the hospitals during the whole process
of model training and forecasting. With the privacy-preserving mechanism, our federated prediction
model trains over all the healthcare data from hospitals in a certain city without actual data sharing
among them. Therefore, it is not only secure but also more accurate than any single prediction model
that trains over the data only from one single hospital. Especially for small hospitals with few
confirmed stroke cases, our federated model boosts model performance by 10%~20% in several machine
learning metrics. To help stroke experts comprehend the advantage of our prediction system more
intuitively, we developed a mobile app that collects the key information of patients' statistics
and demonstrates performance comparisons between the federated prediction model and the single
prediction model during the federated training process.

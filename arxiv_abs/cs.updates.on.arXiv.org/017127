The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted people's lives driving them to act in fear, anxiety, and anger,
leading to worldwide racist events in the physical world and online social networks. Though there
are works focusing on Sinophobia during the COVID-19 pandemic, less attention has been given to
the recent surge in Islamophobia. A large number of positive cases arising out of the religious Tablighi
Jamaat gathering has driven people towards forming anti-Muslim communities around hashtags like
#coronajihad, #tablighijamaatvirus on Twitter. In addition to the online spaces, the rise in Islamophobia
has also resulted in increased hate crimes in the real world. Hence, an investigation is required
to create interventions. To the best of our knowledge, we present the first large-scale quantitative
study linking Islamophobia with COVID-19. In this paper, we present CoronaIslam dataset which
focuses on anti-Muslim hate spanning four months, with over 410,990 tweets from 244,229 unique
users. We use this dataset to perform longitudinal analysis. We find the relation between the trend
on Twitter with the offline events that happened over time, measure the qualitative changes in the
context associated with the Muslim community, and perform macro and micro topic analysis to find
prevalent topics. We also explore the nature of the content, focusing on the toxicity of the URLs
shared within the tweets present in the CoronaIslam dataset. Apart from the content-based analysis,
we focus on user analysis, revealing that the portrayal of religion as a symbol of patriotism played
a crucial role in deciding how the Muslim community was perceived during the pandemic. Through these
experiments, we reveal the existence of anti-Muslim rhetoric around COVID-19 in the Indian sub-continent.

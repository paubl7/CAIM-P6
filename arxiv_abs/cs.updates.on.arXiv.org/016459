Motivation: SBML is the most widespread language for the definition of biochemical models. Although
dozens of SBML simulators are available, there is a general lack of support to the integration of
SBML models within open-standard general-purpose simulation ecosystems. This hinders co-simulation
and integration of SBML models within larger model networks, in order to, e.g. enable in silico clinical
trials of drugs, pharmacological protocols, or engineering artefacts such as biomedical devices
against Virtual Physiological Human models. Modelica is one of the most popular existing open-standard
general-purpose simulation languages, supported by many simulators. Modelica models are especially
suited for the definition of complex networks of heterogeneous models from virtually all application
domains. Models written in Modelica (and in 100+ other languages) can be readily exported into black-box
Functional Mock-Up Units (FMUs), and seamlessly co-simulated and integrated into larger model
networks within open-standard language-independent simulation ecosystems. Results: In order
to enable SBML model integration within heterogeneous model networks, we present SBML2Modelica,
a software system translating SBML models into well-structured, user-intelligible, easily modifiable
Modelica models. SBML2Modelica is SBML Level 3 Version 2-compliant and succeeds on 96.47% of the
SBML Test Suite Core (with a few rare, intricate and easily avoidable combinations of constructs
unsupported and cleanly signalled to the user). Our experimental campaign on 613 models from the
BioModels database (with up to 5438 variables) shows that the major open-source (general-purpose)
Modelica and FMU simulators achieve performance comparable to state-of-the-art specialized
SBML simulators. Availability and implementation: https://bitbucket.org/mclab/sbml2modelica

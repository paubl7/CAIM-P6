Event Argument extraction refers to the task of extracting structured information from unstructured
text for a particular event of interest. The existing works exhibit poor capabilities to extract
causal event arguments like Reason and After Effects. Furthermore, most of the existing works model
this task at a sentence level, restricting the context to a local scope. While it may be effective
for short spans of text, for longer bodies of text such as news articles, it has often been observed
that the arguments for an event do not necessarily occur in the same sentence as that containing an
event trigger. To tackle the issue of argument scattering across sentences, the use of global context
becomes imperative in this task. In our work, we propose an external knowledge aided approach to
infuse document-level event information to aid the extraction of complex event arguments. We develop
a causal network for our event-annotated dataset by extracting relevant event causal structures
from ConceptNet and phrases from Wikipedia. We use the extracted event causal features in a bi-directional
transformer encoder to effectively capture long-range inter-sentence dependencies. We report
the effectiveness of our proposed approach through both qualitative and quantitative analysis.
In this task, we establish our findings on an event annotated dataset in 5 Indian languages. This
dataset adds further complexity to the task by labelling arguments of entity type (like Time, Place)
as well as more complex argument types (like Reason, After-Effect). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art
performance across all the five languages. Since our work does not rely on any language-specific
features, it can be easily extended to other languages.

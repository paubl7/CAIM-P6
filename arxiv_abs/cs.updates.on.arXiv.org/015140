Motivated by recent interest in federated submodel learning, this work explores the fundamental
problem of privately reading from and writing to a database comprised of $K$ files (submodels) that
are stored across $N$ distributed servers according to an $X$-secure threshold secret sharing
scheme. One after another, various users wish to retrieve their desired file, locally process the
information and then update the file in the distributed database while keeping the identity of their
desired file private from any set of up to $T$ colluding servers. The availability of servers changes
over time, so elastic dropout resilience is required. The main contribution of this work is an adaptive
scheme, called ACSA-RW, that takes advantage of all currently available servers to reduce its communication
costs, fully updates the database after each write operation even though the database is only partially
accessible due to server dropouts, and ensures a memoryless operation of the network in the sense
that the storage structure is preserved and future users may remain oblivious of the past history
of server dropouts. The ACSA-RW construction builds upon CSA codes that were originally introduced
for XSTPIR and have been shown to be natural solutions for secure distributed matrix multiplication
problems. ACSA-RW achieves the desired private read and write functionality with elastic dropout
resilience, matches the best results for private-read from PIR literature, improves significantly
upon available baselines for private-write, reveals a striking symmetry between upload and download
costs, and exploits redundant storage dimensions to accommodate arbitrary read and write dropout
servers up to certain threshold values. It also answers in the affirmative an open question by Kairouz
et al. by exploiting synergistic gains from the joint design of private read and write operations.

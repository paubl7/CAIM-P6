In recent years, bankruptcy forecasting has gained lot of attention from researchers as well as
practitioners in the field of financial risk management. For bankruptcy prediction, various approaches
proposed in the past and currently in practice relies on accounting ratios and using statistical
modeling or machine learning methods. These models have had varying degrees of successes. Models
such as Linear Discriminant Analysis or Artificial Neural Network employ discriminative classification
techniques. They lack explicit provision to include prior expert knowledge. In this paper, we propose
another route of generative modeling using Expert Bayesian framework. The biggest advantage of
the proposed framework is an explicit inclusion of expert judgment in the modeling process. Also
the proposed methodology provides a way to quantify uncertainty in prediction. As a result the model
built using Bayesian framework is highly flexible, interpretable and intuitive in nature. The
proposed approach is well suited for highly regulated or safety critical applications such as in
finance or in medical diagnosis. In such cases accuracy in the prediction is not the only concern
for decision makers. Decision makers and other stakeholders are also interested in uncertainty
in the prediction as well as interpretability of the model. We empirically demonstrate these benefits
of proposed framework on real world dataset using Stan, a probabilistic programming language.
We found that the proposed model is either comparable or superior to the other existing methods.
Also resulting model has much less False Positive Rate compared to many existing state of the art
methods. The corresponding R code for the experiments is available at Github repository.

Adversarial robustness of deep neural networks has been actively investigated. However, most
existing defense approaches are limited to a specific type of adversarial perturbations. Specifically,
they often fail to offer resistance to multiple attack types simultaneously, i.e., they lack multi-perturbation
robustness. Furthermore, compared to image recognition problems, the adversarial robustness
of video recognition models is relatively unexplored. While several studies have proposed how
to generate adversarial videos, only a handful of approaches about the defense strategies have
been published in the literature. In this paper, we propose one of the first defense strategies against
multiple types of adversarial videos for video recognition. The proposed method, referred to as
MultiBN, performs adversarial training on multiple adversarial video types using multiple independent
batch normalization (BN) layers with a learning-based BN selection module. With a multiple BN structure,
each BN brach is responsible for learning the distribution of a single perturbation type and thus
provides more precise distribution estimations. This mechanism benefits dealing with multiple
perturbation types. The BN selection module detects the attack type of an input video and sends it
to the corresponding BN branch, making MultiBN fully automatic and allow end-to-end training.
Compared to present adversarial training approaches, the proposed MultiBN exhibits stronger
multi-perturbation robustness against different and even unforeseen adversarial video types,
ranging from Lp-bounded attacks and physically realizable attacks. This holds true on different
datasets and target models. Moreover, we conduct an extensive analysis to study the properties
of the multiple BN structure.

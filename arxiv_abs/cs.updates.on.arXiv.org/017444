The purpose of this paper is to examine the opportunities and barriers of Integrated Human-Machine
Intelligence (IHMI) in civil engineering. Integrating artificial intelligence's high efficiency
and repeatability with humans' adaptability in various contexts can advance timely and reliable
decision-making during civil engineering projects and emergencies. Successful cases in other
domains, such as biomedical science, healthcare, and transportation, showed the potential of
IHMI in data-driven, knowledge-based decision-making in numerous civil engineering applications.
However, whether the industry and academia are ready to embrace the era of IHMI and maximize its benefit
to the industry is still questionable due to several knowledge gaps. This paper thus calls for future
studies in exploring the value, method, and challenges of applying IHMI in civil engineering. Our
systematic review of the literature and motivating cases has identified four knowledge gaps in
achieving effective IHMI in civil engineering. First, it is unknown what types of tasks in the civil
engineering domain can be assisted by AI and to what extent. Second, the interface between human
and AI in civil engineering-related tasks need more precise and formal definition. Third, the barriers
that impede collecting detailed behavioral data from humans and contextual environments deserve
systematic classification and prototyping. Lastly, it is unknown what expected and unexpected
impacts will IHMI have on the AEC industry and entrepreneurship. Analyzing these knowledge gaps
led to a list of identified research questions. This paper will lay the foundation for identifying
relevant studies to form a research roadmap to address the four knowledge gaps identified.

TCSPs (Temporal Constraint Satisfaction Problems), as defined in [Dechter et al., 1991], get rid
of unary constraints by binarizing them after having added an "origin of the world" variable. In
this work, we look at the constraints between the "origin of the world" variable and the other variables,
as the (binarized) domains of these other variables. With this in mind, we define a notion of arc-consistency
for TCSPs, which we will refer to as binarized-domains Arc-Consistency, or bdArc-Consistency
for short. We provide an algorithm achieving bdArc-Consistency for a TCSP, which we will refer to
as bdAC-3, for it is an adaptation of Mackworth's [1977] well-known arc-consistency algorithm
AC-3. We show that if a convex TCSP, referred to in [Dechter et al., 1991] as an STP (Simple Temporal
Problem), is bdArc-Consistent, and its "origin of the world" variable disconnected from none of
the other variables, its binarized domains are minimal. We provide two polynomial backtrack-free
procedures: one for the task of getting, from a bdArc-Consistent STP, either that it is inconsistent
or, in case of consistency, a bdArc-Consistent STP refinement whose "origin of the world" variable
is disconnected from none of the other variables; the other for the task of getting a solution from
a bdArc-Consistent STP whose "origin of the world" variable is disconnected from none of the other
variables. We then show how to use our results both in a general TCSP solver and in a TCSP-based job
shop scheduler. From our work can be extracted a one-to-all all-to-one shortest paths algorithm
of an IR-labelled directed graph. Finally, we show that an existing adaptation to TCSPs of Mackworth's
[1977] path-consistency algorithm PC-2 is not guaranteed to always terminate, and correct it.

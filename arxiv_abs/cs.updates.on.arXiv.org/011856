Traditionally, ensembles of Slepian-Wolf (SW) codes are defined such that every bin of each $n$-vector
of each source is randomly drawn under the uniform distribution across the sets $\{0,1,\ldots,2^{nR_X}-1\}$
and $\{0,1,\ldots,2^{nR_Y}-1\}$, where $R_X$ and $R_Y$ are the coding rates of the two sources,
$X$ and $Y$, respectively. In a few more recent works, where only one source, say, $X$, is compressed
and the other one, $Y$, serves as side information available at the decoder, the scope is extended
to variable-rate S-W (VRSW) codes, where the rate is allowed to depend on the type class of the source
string, but still, the random-binning distribution is assumed uniform within the corresponding,
type-dependent, bin index set. In this expository work, we investigate the role of the uniformity
of the random binning distribution from the perspective of the trade-off between the reliability
(defined in terms of the error exponent) and the compression performance (measured from the viewpoint
of the source coding exponent). To this end, we study a much wider class of random-binning distributions,
which includes the ensemble of VRSW codes as a special case, but it also goes considerably beyond.
We first show that, with the exception of some pathological cases, the smaller ensemble, of VRSW
codes, is as good as the larger ensemble in terms the trade-off between the error exponent and the
source coding exponent. Notwithstanding this finding, the wider class of ensembles proposed is
motivated in two ways. The first is that it outperforms VRSW codes in the above-mentioned pathological
cases, and the second is that it allows robustness: in the event of a system failure that causes unavailability
of the compressed bit-stream from one of the sources, it still allows reconstruction of the other
source within some controllable distortion.

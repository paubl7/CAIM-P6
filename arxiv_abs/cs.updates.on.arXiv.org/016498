Overlap functions are a class of aggregation functions that measure the overlapping degree between
two values. Interval-valued overlap functions were defined as an extension to express the overlapping
of interval-valued data, and they have been usually applied when there is uncertainty regarding
the assignment of membership degrees. The choice of a total order for intervals can be significant,
which motivated the recent developments on interval-valued aggregation functions and interval-valued
overlap functions that are increasing to a given admissible order, that is, a total order that refines
the usual partial order for intervals. Also, width preservation has been considered on these recent
works, in an intent to avoid the uncertainty increase and guarantee the information quality, but
no deeper study was made regarding the relation between the widths of the input intervals and the
output interval, when applying interval-valued functions, or how one can control such uncertainty
propagation based on this relation. Thus, in this paper we: (i) introduce and develop the concepts
of width-limited interval-valued functions and width limiting functions, presenting a theoretical
approach to analyze the relation between the widths of the input and output intervals of bivariate
interval-valued functions, with special attention to interval-valued aggregation functions;
(ii) introduce the concept of $(a,b)$-ultramodular aggregation functions, a less restrictive
extension of one-dimension convexity for bivariate aggregation functions, which have an important
predictable behaviour with respect to the width when extended to the interval-valued context;
(iii) define width-limited interval-valued overlap functions, taking into account a function
that controls the width of the output interval; (iv) present and compare three construction methods
for these width-limited interval-valued overlap functions.

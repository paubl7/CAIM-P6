Graph-modification problems, where we add/delete a small number of vertices/edges to make the
given graph to belong to a simpler graph class, is a well-studied optimization problem in all algorithmic
paradigms including classical, approximation and parameterized complexity. Specifically,
graph-deletion problems, where one needs to delete at most $k$ vertices to place it in a given non-trivial
hereditary (closed under induced subgraphs) graph class, captures several well-studied problems
including {\sc Vertex Cover}, {\sc Feedback Vertex Set}, {\sc Odd Cycle Transveral}, {\sc Cluster
Vertex Deletion}, and {\sc Perfect Deletion}. Investigation into these problems in parameterized
complexity has given rise to powerful tools and techniques. While a precise characterization of
the graph classes for which the problem is {\it fixed-parameter tractable} (FPT) is elusive, it
has long been known that if the graph class is characterized by a {\it finite} set of forbidden graphs,
then the problem is FPT. In this paper, we initiate a study of a natural variation of the problem of
deletion to {\it scattered graph classes} where we need to delete at most $k$ vertices so that in the
resulting graph, each connected component belongs to one of a constant number of graph classes.
A simple hitting set based approach is no longer feasible even if each of the graph classes is characterized
by finite forbidden sets. As our main result, we show that this problem is fixed-parameter tractable
(FPT) when the deletion problem corresponding to each of the finite classes is known to be FPT and
the properties that a graph belongs to each of the classes is expressible in CMSO logic. When each
graph class has a finite forbidden set, we give a faster FPT algorithm using the well-known techniques
of iterative compression and important separators.

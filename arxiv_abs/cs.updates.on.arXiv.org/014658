3D microscopy is key in the investigation of diverse biological systems, and the ever increasing
availability of large datasets demands automatic cell identification methods that not only are
accurate, but also can imply the uncertainty in their predictions to inform about potential errors
and hence confidence in conclusions using them. While conventional deep learning methods often
yield deterministic results, advances in deep Bayesian learning allow for accurate predictions
with a probabilistic interpretation in numerous image classification and segmentation tasks.
It is however nontrivial to extend such Bayesian methods to cell detection, which requires specialized
learning frameworks. In particular, regression of density maps is a popular successful approach
for extracting cell coordinates from local peaks in a postprocessing step, which hinders any meaningful
probabilistic output. We herein propose a deep learning-based cell detection framework that can
operate on large microscopy images and outputs desired probabilistic predictions by (i) integrating
Bayesian techniques for the regression of uncertainty-aware density maps, where peak detection
can be applied to generate cell proposals, and (ii) learning a mapping from the numerous proposals
to a probabilistic space that is calibrated, i.e. accurately represents the chances of a successful
prediction. Utilizing such calibrated predictions, we propose a probabilistic spatial analysis
with Monte-Carlo sampling. We demonstrate this in revising an existing description of the distribution
of a mesenchymal stromal cell type within the bone marrow, where our proposed methods allow us to
reveal spatial patterns that are otherwise undetectable. Introducing such probabilistic analysis
in quantitative microscopy pipelines will allow for reporting confidence intervals for testing
biological hypotheses of spatial distributions.

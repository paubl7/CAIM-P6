The work attempts to unify the conceptual model of the user's virtual computer environment, with
the aim of combining the local environments of operating systems and the global Internet environment
into a single virtual environment built on general principles. To solve this problem, it is proposed
to unify the conceptual basis of these environments. The existing conceptual basis of operating
systems, built on the "desktop" metaphor, contains redundant concepts associated with computer
architecture. The use of the spatial conceptual basis "object - place" with the concepts of "domain",
"site", and "data object" allows to completely virtualize the user environment, separating it
from the hardware concepts. The virtual concept "domain" is becoming a universal way of structuring
the user's space. The introduction of this concept to describe the environments of operating systems
provides at the mental level the integration of the structures of the local and global space. The
use of the concept of "personal domain" will allow replacing the concept of "personal computer"
in the mind of the user. The virtual concept of "site" as an environment for activities and data storage
will allow abandoning such concepts as "application" (program), or "memory device". The site in
the mind of the user is a virtual environment that includes both places for storing data objects and
places for working with them. The introduction of the concept "site" into the structure of operating
systems environments and the concept of "data site" into the structure of the global network integrates
the structure of the global and local space in the user's mind. The introduction of the concept of
"portal" as a means of integrating information necessary for interaction, allows ensuring the
methodological homogeneity of the user's work in a single virtual environment.

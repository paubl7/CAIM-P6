Uncontrolled growth of weeds can severely affect the crop yield and quality. Unrestricted use of
herbicide for weed removal alters biodiversity and cause environmental pollution. Instead, identifying
weed-infested regions can aid selective chemical treatment of these regions. Advances in analyzing
farm images have resulted in solutions to identify weed plants. However, a majority of these approaches
are based on supervised learning methods which requires huge amount of manually annotated images.
As a result, these supervised approaches are economically infeasible for the individual farmer
because of the wide variety of plant species being cultivated. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based
semi-supervised approach for robust estimation of weed density and distribution across farmlands
using only limited color images acquired from autonomous robots. This weed density and distribution
can be useful in a site-specific weed management system for selective treatment of infected areas
using autonomous robots. In this work, the foreground vegetation pixels containing crops and weeds
are first identified using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based unsupervised segmentation.
Subsequently, the weed infected regions are identified using a fine-tuned CNN, eliminating the
need for designing hand-crafted features. The approach is validated on two datasets of different
crop/weed species (1) Crop Weed Field Image Dataset (CWFID), which consists of carrot plant images
and the (2) Sugar Beets dataset. The proposed method is able to localize weed-infested regions a
maximum recall of 0.99 and estimate weed density with a maximum accuracy of 82.13%. Hence, the proposed
approach is shown to generalize to different plant species without the need for extensive labeled
data.

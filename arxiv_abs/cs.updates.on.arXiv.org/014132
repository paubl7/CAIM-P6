Augmenting wireless networks with Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), commonly referred to as drones,
offers a promising avenue for providing reliable, cost-effective, and on-demand wireless services
to desired areas. However, existing UAV communication and trajectory schemes are inefficient
as they assume limited drone mobility and static transmission power. Furthermore, they tend to
rely upon convex approximations to highly non-linear functions and fail to adopt a combination
of heuristic and convex methods. This paper considers a Multi-UAV system where UAV-mounted mobile
base stations serve users on the ground. An iterative approach using block gradient descent is used
to jointly optimize user scheduling, UAV trajectories, and transmission power for maximizing
throughput over all users. Subsequently, an innovative technique for initial trajectory predictions
was developed using a K-means clustering algorithm for partitioning users into subgroups and a
genetic algorithm for initializing shortest flight paths within clusters. Finally, convex optimization
solvers such as MATLAB's Fmincon are used for fine-tuning parameters. Extensive simulation and
optimization results demonstrate a 33.57%, 87.4%, and 53.2% increase in system throughput for
the 1, 2, and 3 UAV scenarios respectively when compared to existing trajectory and communication
design schemes. Furthermore, the K-means and genetic algorithm reveal additional improvements
in throughput by around 15%. Our results note diminished increases in throughput for increases
in UAV trajectory period as the period approaches higher values. Further research into joint adoption
of convex and non-convex schemes as well as consideration of environment-dependent channel models
would allow for a faster and more optimal deployment of UAVs.

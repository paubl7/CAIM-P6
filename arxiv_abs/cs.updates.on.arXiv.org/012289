This paper proposes piece-wise matching layer as a novel layer in representation learning methods
for electrocardiogram (ECG) classification. Despite the remarkable performance of representation
learning methods in the analysis of time series, there are still several challenges associated
with these methods ranging from the complex structures of methods, the lack of generality of solutions,
the need for expert knowledge, and large-scale training datasets. We introduce the piece-wise
matching layer that works based on two levels to address some of the aforementioned challenges.
At the first level, a set of morphological, statistical, and frequency features and comparative
forms of them are computed based on each periodic part and its neighbors. At the second level, these
features are modified by predefined transformation functions based on a receptive field scenario.
Several scenarios of offline processing, incremental processing, fixed sliding receptive field,
and event-based triggering receptive field can be implemented based on the choice of length and
mechanism of indicating the receptive field. We propose dynamic time wrapping as a mechanism that
indicates a receptive field based on event triggering tactics. To evaluate the performance of this
method in time series analysis, we applied the proposed layer in two publicly available datasets
of PhysioNet competitions in 2015 and 2017 where the input data is ECG signal. We compared the performance
of our method against a variety of known tuned methods from expert knowledge, machine learning,
deep learning methods, and the combination of them. The proposed approach improves the state of
the art in two known completions 2015 and 2017 around 4% and 7% correspondingly while it does not rely
on in advance knowledge of the classes or the possible places of arrhythmia.

The machine learning (ML) life cycle involves a series of iterative steps, from the effective gathering
and preparation of the data, including complex feature engineering processes, to the presentation
and improvement of results, with various algorithms to choose from in every step. Feature engineering
in particular can be very beneficial for ML, leading to numerous improvements such as boosting the
predictive results, decreasing computational times, reducing excessive noise, and increasing
the transparency behind the decisions taken during the training. Despite that, while several visual
analytics tools exist to monitor and control the different stages of the ML life cycle (especially
those related to data and algorithms), feature engineering support remains inadequate. In this
paper, we present FeatureEnVi, a visual analytics system specifically designed to assist with
the feature engineering process. Our proposed system helps users to choose the most important feature,
to transform the original features into powerful alternatives, and to experiment with different
feature generation combinations. Additionally, data space slicing allows users to explore the
impact of features on both local and global scales. FeatureEnVi utilizes multiple automatic feature
selection techniques; furthermore, it visually guides users with statistical evidence about
the influence of each feature (or subsets of features). The final outcome is the extraction of heavily
engineered features, evaluated by multiple validation metrics. The usefulness and applicability
of FeatureEnVi are demonstrated with two use cases, using a popular red wine quality data set and
publicly available data related to vehicle recognition from their silhouettes. We also report
feedback from interviews with ML experts and a visualization researcher who assessed the effectiveness
of our system.

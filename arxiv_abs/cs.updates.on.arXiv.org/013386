Communication networks are used today everywhere and on every scale: starting from small Internet
of Things (IoT) networks at home, via campus and enterprise networks, and up to tier-one networks
of Internet providers. Accordingly, network devices should support a plethora of tasks with highly
heterogeneous characteristics in terms of processing time, bandwidth energy consumption, deadlines
and so on. Evaluating these characteristics and the amount of currently available resources for
handling them requires analyzing all the arriving inputs, gathering information from numerous
remote devices, and integrating all this information. Performing all these tasks in real time is
very challenging in today's networking environments, which are characterized by tight bounds
on the latency, and always-increasing data rates. Hence, network algorithms should typically
make decisions under uncertainty. This work addresses optimizing performance in heterogeneous
and uncertain networking environments. We begin by detailing the sources of heterogeneity and
uncertainty and show that uncertainty appears in all layers of network design, including the time
required to perform a task; the amount of available resources; and the expected gain from successfully
completing a task. Next, we survey current solutions and show their limitations. Based on these
insights we develop general design concepts to tackle heterogeneity and uncertainty, and then
use these concepts to design practical algorithms. For each of our algorithms, we provide rigorous
mathematical analysis, thus showing worst-case performance guarantees. Finally, we implement
and run the suggested algorithms on various input traces, thus obtaining further insights as to
our algorithmic design principles.

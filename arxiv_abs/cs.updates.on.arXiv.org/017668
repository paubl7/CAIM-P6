Using stochastic geometry tools, we develop a comprehensive framework to analyze the downlink
coverage probability, ergodic capacity, and energy efficiency (EE) of various types of users (e.g.,
users served by direct base station (BS) transmissions and indirect intelligent reflecting surface
(IRS)-assisted transmissions) in a cellular network with multiple BSs and IRSs. The proposed stochastic
geometry framework can capture the impact of channel fading, locations of BSs and IRSs, arbitrary
phase-shifts and interference experienced by a typical user supported by direct transmission
and/or IRS-assisted transmission. For IRS-assisted transmissions, we first model the desired
signal power from the nearest IRS as a sum of scaled generalized gamma (GG) random variables whose
parameters are functions of the IRS phase shifts. Then, we derive the Laplace Transform (LT) of the
received signal power in a closed form. Also, we model the aggregate interference from multiple
IRSs as the sum of normal random variables. Then, we derive the LT of the aggregate interference from
all IRSs and BSs. The derived LT expressions are used to calculate coverage probability, ergodic
capacity, and EE for users served by direct BS transmissions as well as users served by IRS-assisted
transmissions. Finally, we derive the overall network coverage probability, ergodic capacity,
and EE based on the fraction of direct and IRS-assisted users, which is defined as a function of the
deployment intensity of IRSs, as well as blockage probability of direct transmission links. Numerical
results validate the derived analytical expressions and extract useful insights related to the
number of IRS elements, large-scale deployment of IRSs and BSs, and the impact of IRS interference
on direct transmissions.

For the spectral fractional diffusion operator of order $2s\in (0,2)$ in bounded, curvilinear
polygonal domains $\Omega$ we prove exponential convergence of two classes of $hp$ discretizations
under the assumption of analytic data, without any boundary compatibility, in the natural fractional
Sobolev norm $\mathbb{H}^s(\Omega)$. The first $hp$ discretization is based on writing the solution
as a co-normal derivative of a $2+1$-dimensional local, linear elliptic boundary value problem,
to which an $hp$-FE discretization is applied. A diagonalization in the extended variable reduces
the numerical approximation of the inverse of the spectral fractional diffusion operator to the
numerical approximation of a system of local, decoupled, second order reaction-diffusion equations
in $\Omega$. Leveraging results on robust exponential convergence of $hp$-FEM for second order,
linear reaction diffusion boundary value problems in $\Omega$, exponential convergence rates
for solutions $u\in \mathbb{H}^s(\Omega)$ of $\mathcal{L}^s u = f$ follow. Key ingredient in this
$hp$-FEM are boundary fitted meshes with geometric mesh refinement towards $\partial\Omega$.
The second discretization is based on exponentially convergent sinc quadrature approximations
of the Balakrishnan integral representation of $\mathcal{L}^{-s}$, combined with $hp$-FE discretizations
of a decoupled system of local, linear, singularly perturbed reaction-diffusion equations in
$\Omega$. The present analysis for either approach extends to polygonal subsets $\widetilde{\mathcal{M}}$
of analytic, compact $2$-manifolds $\mathcal{M}$. Numerical experiments for model problems
in nonconvex polygonal domains and with incompatible data confirm the theoretical results. Exponentially
small bounds on Kolmogoroff $n$-widths of solutions sets for spectral fractional diffusion in
polygons are deduced.

The COVID-19 pandemic has caused many shutdowns in different industries around the world. Sectors
such as infrastructure construction and maintenance projects have not been suspended due to their
significant effect on people's routine life. In such projects, workers work close together that
makes a high risk of infection. The World Health Organization recommends wearing a face mask and
practicing physical distancing to mitigate the virus's spread. This paper developed a computer
vision system to automatically detect the violation of face mask wearing and physical distancing
among construction workers to assure their safety on infrastructure projects during the pandemic.
For the face mask detection, the paper collected and annotated 1,000 images, including different
types of face mask wearing, and added them to a pre-existing face mask dataset to develop a dataset
of 1,853 images. Then trained and tested multiple Tensorflow state-of-the-art object detection
models on the face mask dataset and chose the Faster R-CNN Inception ResNet V2 network that yielded
the accuracy of 99.8%. For physical distance detection, the paper employed the Faster R-CNN Inception
V2 to detect people. A transformation matrix was used to eliminate the camera angle's effect on the
object distances on the image. The Euclidian distance used the pixels of the transformed image to
compute the actual distance between people. A threshold of six feet was considered to capture physical
distance violation. The paper also used transfer learning for training the model. The final model
was applied on four videos of road maintenance projects in Houston, TX, that effectively detected
the face mask and physical distance. We recommend that construction owners use the proposed system
to enhance construction workers' safety in the pandemic situation.

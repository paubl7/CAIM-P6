Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) contain more biology-realistic structures and biology-inspired
learning principles compared with that in standard Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). The dynamic
neurons in SNNs are non-differential, containing decayed historical states and generating event-based
spikes after their states reaching the firing threshold. This dynamic characteristic of SNNs made
it hard to be directly trained with standard back propagation (BP) which is considered not biologically
plausible. In this paper, a Biologically-plausible Reward Propagation (BRP) algorithm is proposed
and applied on a SNN architecture with both spiking-convolution (with both 1D and 2D convolutional
kernels) and full-connection layers. Different with standard BP that propagated the error signals
from post to pre synaptic neurons layer by layer, the BRP propagated the target labels instead of
target errors directly from the output layer to all of the pre hidden layers. This effort was more
consistent with the top-down reward-guiding learning in cortical columns of the neocortex. Then
synaptic modifications with only local gradient differences were induced with pseudo-BP that
might also be replaced with Spike-Timing Dependent Plasticity (STDP). The performance of the proposed
BRP-SNN was further verified on spatial (including MNIST and Cifar-10) and temporal (including
TIDigits and DvsGesture) tasks. The experimental result showed that the BRP played roles on convergent
learning of SNN, reached higher accuracy compared with other state-of-the-art SNN algorithms,
and saved more than 50% computational cost compared with that on ANNs. We think the introduction
of biologically-plausible learning rules to the training procedure of biologically-realistic
SNNs might give us more hints and inspirations towards a better understanding of the intelligent
nature of the biological system.

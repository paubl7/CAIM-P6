In this paper we propose and analyze a (temporally) third order accurate backward differentiation
formula (BDF) numerical scheme for the no-slope-selection (NSS) equation of the epitaxial thin
film growth model, with Fourier pseudo-spectral discretization in space. The surface diffusion
term is treated implicitly, while the nonlinear chemical potential is approximated by a third order
explicit extrapolation formula for the sake of solvability. In addition, a third order accurate
Douglas-Dupont regularization term, in the form of $-A \Delta t^2 \Delta_N^2 ( u^{n+1} - u^n)$,
is added in the numerical scheme. A careful energy stability estimate, combined with Fourier eigenvalue
analysis, results in the energy stability in a modified version, and a theoretical justification
of the coefficient $A$ becomes available. As a result of this energy stability analysis, a uniform
in time bound of the numerical energy is obtained. And also, the optimal rate convergence analysis
and error estimate are derived in details, in the $\ell^\infty (0,T; \ell^2) \cap \ell^2 (0,T; H_h^2)$
norm, with the help of a linearized estimate for the nonlinear error terms. %This convergence estimate
is the first such result for a third order accurate scheme for a gradient flow. Some numerical simulation
results are presented to demonstrate the efficiency of the numerical scheme and the third order
convergence. The long time simulation results for $\varepsilon=0.02$ (up to $T=3 \times 10^5$)
have indicated a logarithm law for the energy decay, as well as the power laws for growth of the surface
roughness and the mound width. In particular, the power index for the surface roughness and the mound
width growth, created by the third order numerical scheme, is more accurate than those produced
by certain second order energy stable schemes in the existing literature.

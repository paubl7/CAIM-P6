With the growing utility of today's conversational virtual assistants, the importance of user
motivation in human-AI interaction is becoming more obvious. However, previous studies in this
and related fields, such as human-computer interaction and human-robot interaction, scarcely
discussed intrinsic motivation and its affecting factors. Those studies either treated motivation
as an inseparable concept or focused on non-intrinsic motivation. The current study aims to cover
intrinsic motivation by taking an affective-engineering approach. A novel motivation model is
proposed, in which intrinsic motivation is affected by two factors that derive from user interactions
with virtual assistants: expectation of capability and uncertainty. Experiments are conducted
where these two factors are manipulated by making participants believe they are interacting with
the smart speaker "Amazon Echo". Intrinsic motivation is measured both by using questionnaires
and by covertly monitoring a five-minute free-choice period in the experimenter's absence, during
which the participants could decide for themselves whether to interact with the virtual assistants.
Results of the first experiment showed that high expectation engenders more intrinsically motivated
interaction compared with low expectation. The results also suggested suppressive effects by
uncertainty on intrinsic motivation, though we had not hypothesized before experiments. We then
revised our hypothetical model of action selection accordingly and conducted a verification experiment
of uncertainty's effects. Results of the verification experiment showed that reducing uncertainty
encourages more interactions and causes the motivation behind these interactions to shift from
non-intrinsic to intrinsic.

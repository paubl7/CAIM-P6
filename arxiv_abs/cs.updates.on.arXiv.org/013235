Purpose: Accurate segmentation of lung and infection in COVID-19 CT scans plays an important role
in the quantitative management of patients. Most of the existing studies are based on large and private
annotated datasets that are impractical to obtain from a single institution, especially when radiologists
are busy fighting the coronavirus disease. Furthermore, it is hard to compare current COVID-19
CT segmentation methods as they are developed on different datasets, trained in different settings,
and evaluated with different metrics. Methods: To promote the development of data-efficient deep
learning methods, in this paper, we built three benchmarks for lung and infection segmentation
based on 70 annotated COVID-19 cases, which contain current active research areas, e.g., few-shot
learning, domain generalization, and knowledge transfer. For a fair comparison among different
segmentation methods, we also provide standard training, validation and testing splits, evaluation
metrics and, the corresponding code. Results: Based on the state-of-the-art network, we provide
more than 40 pre-trained baseline models, which not only serve as out-of-the-box segmentation
tools but also save computational time for researchers who are interested in COVID-19 lung and infection
segmentation. We achieve average Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) scores of 97.3\%, 97.7\%,
and 67.3\% and average Normalized Surface Dice (NSD) scores of 90.6\%, 91.4\%, and 70.0\% for left
lung, right lung, and infection, respectively. Conclusions: To the best of our knowledge, this
work presents the first data-efficient learning benchmark for medical image segmentation and
the largest number of pre-trained models up to now. All these resources are publicly available,
and our work lays the foundation for promoting the development of deep learning methods for efficient
COVID-19 CT segmentation with limited data.

Estimation of pain intensity from facial expressions captured in videos has an immense potential
for health care applications. Given the challenges related to subjective variations of facial
expressions, and operational capture conditions, the accuracy of state-of-the-art DL models
for recognizing facial expressions may decline. Domain adaptation has been widely explored to
alleviate the problem of domain shifts that typically occur between video data captured across
various source and target domains. Moreover, given the laborious task of collecting and annotating
videos, and subjective bias due to ambiguity among adjacent intensity levels, weakly-supervised
learning is gaining attention in such applications. State-of-the-art WSL models are typically
formulated as regression problems, and do not leverage the ordinal relationship among pain intensity
levels, nor temporal coherence of multiple consecutive frames. This paper introduces a new DL model
for weakly-supervised DA with ordinal regression that can be adapted using target domain videos
with coarse labels provided on a periodic basis. The WSDA-OR model enforces ordinal relationships
among intensity levels assigned to target sequences, and associates multiple relevant frames
to sequence-level labels. In particular, it learns discriminant and domain-invariant feature
representations by integrating multiple instance learning with deep adversarial DA, where soft
Gaussian labels are used to efficiently represent the weak ordinal sequence-level labels from
target domain. The proposed approach was validated using RECOLA video dataset as fully-labeled
source domain data, and UNBC-McMaster shoulder pain video dataset as weakly-labeled target domain
data. We have also validated WSDA-OR on BIOVID and Fatigue datasets for sequence level estimation.

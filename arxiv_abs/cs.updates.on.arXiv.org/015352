Mobile edge computing (MEC) has been envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume
of data generated from ubiquitous mobile devices for enabling intelligent services with the help
of artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data
collection and training in a single entity, e.g., an MEC server, which is now becoming a weak point
due to data privacy concerns and high data communication overheads. In this context, federated
learning (FL) has been proposed to provide collaborative data training solutions, by coordinating
multiple mobile devices to train a shared AI model without exposing their data, which enjoys considerable
privacy enhancement. To improve the security and scalability of FL implementation, blockchain
as a ledger technology is attractive for realizing decentralized FL training without the need for
any central server. Particularly, the integration of FL and blockchain leads to a new paradigm,
called FLchain, which potentially transforms intelligent MEC networks into decentralized, secure,
and privacy-enhancing systems. This article presents an overview of the fundamental concepts
and explores the opportunities of FLchain in MEC networks. We identify several main topics in FLchain
design, including communication cost, resource allocation, incentive mechanism, security and
privacy protection. The key solutions for FLchain design are provided, and the lessons learned
as well as the outlooks are also discussed. Then, we investigate the applications of FLchain in popular
MEC domains, such as edge data sharing, edge content caching and edge crowdsensing. Finally, important
research challenges and future directions are also highlighted.

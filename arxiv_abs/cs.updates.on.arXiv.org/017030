In this work, we study the discrete logarithm problem in the context of TFNP - the complexity class
of search problems with a syntactically guaranteed existence of a solution for all instances. Our
main results establish that suitable variants of the discrete logarithm problem are complete for
the complexity class PPP, respectively PWPP, i.e., the subclasses of TFNP capturing total search
problems with a solution guaranteed by the pigeonhole principle, respectively the weak pigeonhole
principle. Besides answering an open problem from the recent work of Sotiraki, Zampetakis, and
Zirdelis (FOCS'18), our completeness results for PPP and PWPP have implications for the recent
line of work proving conditional lower bounds for problems in TFNP under cryptographic assumptions.
In particular, they highlight that any attempt at basing average-case hardness in subclasses of
TFNP (other than PWPP and PPP) on the average-case hardness of the discrete logarithm problem must
exploit its structural properties beyond what is necessary for constructions of collision-resistant
hash functions. Additionally, our reductions provide new structural insights into the class PWPP
by establishing two new PWPP-complete problems. First, the problem DOVE, a relaxation of the PPP-complete
problem PIGEON. DOVE is the first PWPP-complete problem not defined in terms of an explicitly shrinking
function. Second, the problem CLAW, a total search problem capturing the computational complexity
of breaking claw-free permutations. In the context of TFNP, the PWPP-completeness of CLAW matches
the known intrinsic relationship between collision-resistant hash functions and claw-free permutations
established in the cryptographic literature.

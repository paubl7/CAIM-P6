It is said that blockchain will contribute to the digital transformation of society in a wide range
of ways, from the management of public and private documents to the traceability in various industries,
as well as digital currencies. A number of so-called blockchain platforms have been developed,
and experiments and applications have been carried out on them. But are these platforms really conducive
to practical use of the blockchain concept? To answer the question, we need to better understand
what the technology called blockchain really is. We need to sort out the confusion we see in understanding
what blockchain was invented for and what it means. We also need to clarify the structure of its applications.
This document provides a generic model of understanding blockchain and its applications. We introduce
design patterns to classify the platforms. We categorize possible use cases by identifying the
structure among applications, and organize the functional, performance, operational and legal
requirements for each such case. Based on the categorization and criteria, we evaluated and compared
the following platforms: Hyperledger Fabric, Hyperledger Iroha, Hyperledger Indy, Ethereum,
Quorum/Hyperledger Besu, Ethereum 2.0, Polkadot, Corda and BBc-1. We have tried to be fair in our
evaluations and comparisons, but we also expect to provoke discussion. The intended readers for
this document is anyone involved in development of application systems who wants to understand
blockchain and their platforms, including non-engineers and non-technologists. The assessments
in this document will allow readers to understand the technological requirements for the blockchain
platforms, to question existing technologies, and to choose the appropriate platforms for the
applications they envision. The comparisons hopefully will also be useful as a guide for designing
new technologies.

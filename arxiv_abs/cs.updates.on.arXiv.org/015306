Various volatile aerosols have been associated with adverse health effects; however, characterization
of these aerosols is challenging due to their dynamic nature. Here we present a method that directly
measures the volatility of particulate matter (PM) using computational microscopy and deep learning.
This method was applied to aerosols generated by electronic cigarettes (e-cigs), which vaporize
a liquid mixture (e-liquid) that mainly consists of propylene glycol (PG), vegetable glycerin
(VG), nicotine, and flavoring compounds. E-cig generated aerosols were recorded by a field-portable
computational microscope, using an impaction-based air sampler. A lensless digital holographic
microscope inside this mobile device continuously records the inline holograms of the collected
particles. A deep learning-based algorithm is used to automatically reconstruct the microscopic
images of e-cig generated particles from their holograms, and rapidly quantify their volatility.
To evaluate the effects of e-liquid composition on aerosol dynamics, we measured the volatility
of the particles generated by flavorless, nicotine-free e-liquids with various PG/VG volumetric
ratios, revealing a negative correlation between the particles' volatility and the volumetric
ratio of VG in the e-liquid. For a given PG/VG composition, the addition of nicotine dominated the
evaporation dynamics of the e-cig aerosol and the aforementioned negative correlation was no longer
observed. We also revealed that flavoring additives in e-liquids significantly decrease the volatility
of e-cig aerosol. The presented holographic volatility measurement technique and the associated
mobile device might provide new insights on the volatility of e-cig generated particles and can
be applied to characterize various volatile PM.

Software effort estimation accuracy is a key factor in effective planning, controlling and to deliver
a successful software project within budget and schedule. The overestimation and underestimation
both are the key challenges for future software development, henceforth there is a continuous need
for accuracy in software effort estimation (SEE). The researchers and practitioners are striving
to identify which machine learning estimation technique gives more accurate results based on evaluation
measures, datasets and the other relevant attributes. The authors of related research are generally
not aware of previously published results of machine learning effort estimation techniques. The
main aim of this study is to assist the researchers to know which machine learning technique yields
the promising effort estimation accuracy prediction in the software development. In this paper,
the performance of the machine learning ensemble technique is investigated with the solo technique
based on two most commonly used accuracy evaluation metrics. We used the systematic literature
review methodology proposed by Kitchenham and Charters. This includes searching for the most relevant
papers, applying quality assessment criteria, extracting data and drawing results. We have evaluated
a state-of-the-art accuracy performance of 28 selected studies (14 ensemble, 14 solo) using Mean
Magnitude of Relative Error (MMRE) and PRED (25) as a set of reliable accuracy metrics for performance
evaluation of accuracy among two techniques to report the research questions stated in this study.
We found that machine learning techniques are the most frequently implemented in the construction
of ensemble effort estimation (EEE) techniques. The results of this study revealed that the EEE
techniques usually yield a promising estimation accuracy than the solo techniques.

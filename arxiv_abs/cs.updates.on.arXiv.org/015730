In this paper, we consider user selection and downlink precoding for an over-loaded single-cell
massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system in frequency division duplexing (FDD)
mode, where the base station is equipped with a dual-polarized uniform planar array (DP-UPA) and
serves a large number of single-antenna users. Due to the absence of uplink-downlink channel reciprocity
and the high-dimensionality of channel matrices, it is extremely challenging to design downlink
precoders using closed-loop channel probing and feedback with limited spectrum resource. To address
these issues, a novel methodology -- active channel sparsification (ACS) -- has been proposed recently
in the literature for uniform linear array (ULA) to design sparsifying precoders, which boosts
spectral efficiency for multi-user downlink transmission with substantially reduced channel
feedback overhead. Pushing forward this line of research, we aim to facilitate the potential deployment
of ACS in practical FDD massive MIMO systems, by extending it from ULA to DP-UPA with explicit user
selection and making the current ACS implementation simplified. To this end, by leveraging Toeplitz
structure of channel covariance matrices, we extend the original ACS using scale-weight bipartite
graph representation to the matrix-weight counterpart. Building upon this, we propose a multi-dimensional
ACS (MD-ACS) method, which is a generalization of original ACS formulation and is more suitable
for DP-UPA antenna configurations. The nonlinear integer program formulation of MD-ACS can be
classified as a generalized multi-assignment problem (GMAP), for which we propose a simple yet
efficient greedy algorithm to solve it. Simulation results demonstrate the performance improvement
of the proposed MD-ACS with greedy algorithm over the state-of-the-art methods based on the QuaDRiGa
channel models.

Predicting the final ischaemic stroke lesion provides crucial information regarding the volume
of salvageable hypoperfused tissue, which helps physicians in the difficult decision-making
process of treatment planning and intervention. Treatment selection is influenced by clinical
diagnosis, which requires delineating the stroke lesion, as well as characterising cerebral blood
flow dynamics using neuroimaging acquisitions. Nonetheless, predicting the final stroke lesion
is an intricate task, due to the variability in lesion size, shape, location and the underlying cerebral
haemodynamic processes that occur after the ischaemic stroke takes place. Moreover, since elapsed
time between stroke and treatment is related to the loss of brain tissue, assessing and predicting
the final stroke lesion needs to be performed in a short period of time, which makes the task even more
complex. Therefore, there is a need for automatic methods that predict the final stroke lesion and
support physicians in the treatment decision process. We propose a fully automatic deep learning
method based on unsupervised and supervised learning to predict the final stroke lesion after 90
days. Our aim is to predict the final stroke lesion location and extent, taking into account the underlying
cerebral blood flow dynamics that can influence the prediction. To achieve this, we propose a two-branch
Restricted Boltzmann Machine, which provides specialized data-driven features from different
sets of standard parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging maps. These data-driven feature maps are
then combined with the parametric Magnetic Resonance Imaging maps, and fed to a Convolutional and
Recurrent Neural Network architecture. We evaluated our proposal on the publicly available ISLES
2017 testing dataset, reaching a Dice score of 0.38, Hausdorff Distance of 29.21 mm, and Average
Symmetric Surface Distance of 5.52 mm.

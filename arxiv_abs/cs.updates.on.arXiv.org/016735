The Fisher market is one of the most fundamental models for resource allocation problems in economic
theory, wherein agents spend a budget of currency to buy goods that maximize their utilities, while
producers sell capacity constrained goods in exchange for currency. However, the consideration
of only two types of constraints, i.e., budgets of individual buyers and capacities of goods, makes
Fisher markets less amenable for resource allocation settings when agents have additional linear
constraints, e.g., knapsack and proportionality constraints. In this work, we introduce a modified
Fisher market, where each agent may have additional linear constraints and show that this modification
to classical Fisher markets fundamentally alters the properties of the market equilibrium as well
as the optimal allocations. These properties of the modified Fisher market prompt us to introduce
a budget perturbed social optimization problem (BP-SOP) and set prices based on the dual variables
of BP-SOP's capacity constraints. To compute the budget perturbations, we develop a fixed point
iterative scheme and validate its convergence through numerical experiments. Since this fixed
point iterative scheme involves solving a centralized problem at each step, we propose a new class
of distributed algorithms to compute equilibrium prices. In particular, we develop an Alternating
Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) algorithm with strong convergence guarantees for Fisher
markets with homogeneous linear constraints as well as for classical Fisher markets. In this algorithm,
the prices are updated based on the tatonnement process, with a step size that is completely independent
of the utilities of individual agents. Thus, our mechanism, both theoretically and computationally,
overcomes a fundamental limitation of classical Fisher markets, which only consider capacity
and budget constraints.

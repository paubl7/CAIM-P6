A moment function is called doubly robust if it is comprised of two nuisance functions and the estimator
based on it is a consistent estimator of the target parameter even if one of the nuisance functions
is misspecified. In this paper, we consider a class of doubly robust moment functions originally
introduced in (Robins et al., 2008). We demonstrate that this moment function can be used to construct
estimating equations for the nuisance functions. The main idea is to choose each nuisance function
such that it minimizes the dependency of the expected value of the moment function to the other nuisance
function. We implement this idea as a minimax optimization problem. We then provide conditions
required for asymptotic linearity of the estimator of the parameter of interest, which are based
on the convergence rate of the product of the errors of the nuisance functions, as well as the local
ill-posedness of a conditional expectation operator. The convergence rates of the nuisance functions
are analyzed using the modern techniques in statistical learning theory based on the Rademacher
complexity of the function spaces. We specifically focus on the case that the function spaces are
reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces, which enables us to use its spectral properties to analyze the
convergence rates. As an application of the proposed methodology, we consider the parameter of
average causal effect both in presence and absence of latent confounders. For the case of presence
of latent confounders, we use the recently proposed proximal causal inference framework of (Miao
et al., 2018; Tchetgen Tchetgen et al., 2020), and hence our results lead to a robust non-parametric
estimator for average causal effect in this framework.

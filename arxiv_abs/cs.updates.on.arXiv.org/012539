Numerous popular online social networks (OSN) would classify users into different categories
and recommend users to each other with similar interests. A small number of users, so-called perturbators,
may perform some types of behaviors, which significantly disturb such an OSN classifier. Manual
annotation by OSN administrators is one kind of potential solutions. However, the manual annotation
unavoidably brings into noise. Besides, such perturbators are not Sybil users, and therefore their
accounts cannot be frozen. To improve the robustness of such an OSN classifier, we generalize this
issue as the defense of Graph Convolutional Networks (GCNs) on the node classification task. Most
existing defenses on this task can be divided into the adversarial-based method and the detection-based
method. The adversarial-based method improves the robustness of GCNs by training with adversarial
samples. However, in our case, the perturbators are hard to be distinguished by OSN administrators
and thus we cannot use adversarial samples in the training phase. By contrast, the detection-based
method aims at detecting the attacker nodes or edges and alleviates the negative impact by removing
them. In our scenario, nevertheless, the perturbators are not the attacker and thus cannot be eliminated.
Both methods could not solve the aforementioned problems. To address these issues, we propose a
novel graph label transition model, named GraphLT, to improve the robustness of the OSN classifier
by transiting the node latent representation based on dynamic conditional label transition. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that GraphLT can not only considerably enhance the performance of the
node classifier in a clean environment but also successfully remedy the classifier with superior
performance over competing methods on seven benchmark datasets after graph perturbation.

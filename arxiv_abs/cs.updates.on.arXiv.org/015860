An ordering constraint satisfaction problem (OCSP) is given by a positive integer $k$ and a constraint
predicate $\Pi$ mapping permutations on $\{1,\ldots,k\}$ to $\{0,1\}$. Given an instance of OCSP$(\Pi)$
on $n$ variables and $m$ constraints, the goal is to find an ordering of the $n$ variables that maximizes
the number of constraints that are satisfied, where a constraint specifies a sequence of $k$ distinct
variables and the constraint is satisfied by an ordering on the $n$ variables if the ordering induced
on the $k$ variables in the constraint satisfies $\Pi$. Natural ordering constraint satisfaction
problems include "Maximum acyclic subgraph (MAS)" and "Betweenness". In this work we consider
the task of approximating the maximum number of satisfiable constraints in the (single-pass) streaming
setting, where an instance is presented as a stream of constraints. We show that for every $\Pi$,
algorithms using $o(\sqrt{n})$ space cannot distinguish streams where almost every constraint
is satisfiable from streams where no ordering beats the random ordering by a noticeable amount.
In the case of MAS our result shows that for every $\epsilon>0$, MAS is not $1/2+\epsilon$-approximable.
The previous best inapproximability result only ruled out a $3/4$ approximation. Our results build
on a recent work of Chou, Golovnev, Sudan, and Velusamy who show tight inapproximability results
for some constraint satisfaction problems over arbitrary (finite) alphabets. We show that the
hard instances from this earlier work have the property that in every partition of the hypergraph
formed by the constraints into small blocks, most of the hyperedges are incident on vertices from
distinct blocks. By exploiting this combinatorial property, in combination with a natural reduction
from CSPs over large finite alphabets to OCSPs, we give optimal inapproximability results for all
OCSPs.

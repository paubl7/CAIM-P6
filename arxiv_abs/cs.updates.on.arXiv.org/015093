Passive radio frequency (RF) sensing and monitoring of human daily activities in elderly care homes
has recently become an emerging topic due to the demand with ageing population. Micro-Doppler radars
are an appealing solution considering their non-intrusiveness, deep penetration, and high-distance
range. This study presents an unsupervised framework for human activity monitoring using Doppler
streams. Two unsupervised feature extraction strategies based on convolutional filtering and
texture analysis of Doppler images are considered. For the former, encoded features using Convolutional
Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) are compared with Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE) features.
For the latter, Grey-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) is used. These methods are further compared
with unsupervised linear feature extraction based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD). Using these features, unsupervised samples clustering is performed
using K-Means and K-Medoids. Actual labels are solely used for evaluation and visualisation. The
results showcase 82.5% and 84% average testing accuracies for CVAE features and 77.5% and 72.5%
average testing accuracy using texture features based on GLCM using K-Means and K-Medoids respectively.
The results show superiority of CVAE and GLCM features compared to PCA, SVD, and CAE with more than
20% average accuracy. Furthermore, for high-dimensional data visualisation, three manifold
learning techniques are considered including t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbour Embedding
(t-SNE), Multidimensional Scaling (MDS), and Locally Linear Embedding (LLE). The visualisation
methods are compared for projection of raw data as well as the encoded features using CVAE. All three
methods show an improved visualisation ability when applied on the transformed CVAE data.

The ubiquity of massive graph data sets in numerous applications requires fast algorithms for extracting
knowledge from these data. We are motivated here by three electrical measures for the analysis of
large small-world graphs $G = (V, E)$ -- i.e., graphs with diameter in $O(\log |V|)$, which are abundant
in complex network analysis. From a computational point of view, the three measures have in common
that their crucial component is the diagonal of the graph Laplacian's pseudoinverse, $L^\dagger$.
Computing diag$(L^\dagger)$ exactly by pseudoinversion, however, is as expensive as dense matrix
multiplication -- and the standard tools in practice even require cubic time. Moreover, the pseudoinverse
requires quadratic space -- hardly feasible for large graphs. Resorting to approximation by, e.g.,
using the Johnson-Lindenstrauss transform, requires the solution of $O(\log |V| / \epsilon^2)$
Laplacian linear systems to guarantee a relative error, which is still very expensive for large
inputs. In this paper, we present a novel approximation algorithm that requires the solution of
only one Laplacian linear system. The remaining parts are purely combinatorial -- mainly sampling
uniform spanning trees, which we relate to diag$(L^\dagger)$ via effective resistances. For small-world
networks, our algorithm obtains a $\pm \epsilon$-approximation with high probability, in a time
that is nearly-linear in $|E|$ and quadratic in $1 / \epsilon$. Another positive aspect of our algorithm
is its parallel nature due to independent sampling. We thus provide two parallel implementations
of our algorithm: one using OpenMP, one MPI + OpenMP. In our experiments against the state of the art,
our algorithm (i) yields more accurate results, (ii) is much faster and more memory-efficient,
and (iii) obtains good parallel speedups, in particular in the distributed setting.

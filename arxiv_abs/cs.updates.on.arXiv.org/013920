We consider the reconstruction problem of video snapshot compressive imaging (SCI), which captures
high-speed videos using a low-speed 2D sensor (detector). The underlying principle of SCI is to
modulate sequential high-speed frames with different masks and then these encoded frames are integrated
into a snapshot on the sensor and thus the sensor can be of low-speed. On one hand, video SCI enjoys
the advantages of low-bandwidth, low-power and low-cost. On the other hand, applying SCI to large-scale
problems (HD or UHD videos) in our daily life is still challenging and one of the bottlenecks lies
in the reconstruction algorithm. Exiting algorithms are either too slow (iterative optimization
algorithms) or not flexible to the encoding process (deep learning based end-to-end networks).
In this paper, we develop fast and flexible algorithms for SCI based on the plug-and-play (PnP) framework.
In addition to the PnP-ADMM method, we further propose the PnP-GAP (generalized alternating projection)
algorithm with a lower computational workload. We first employ the image deep denoising priors
to show that PnP can recover a UHD color video with 30 frames from a snapshot measurement. Since videos
have strong temporal correlation, by employing the video deep denoising priors, we achieve a significant
improvement in the results. Furthermore, we extend the proposed PnP algorithms to the color SCI
system using mosaic sensors, where each pixel only captures the red, green or blue channels. A joint
reconstruction and demosaicing paradigm is developed for flexible and high quality reconstruction
of color video SCI systems. Extensive results on both simulation and real datasets verify the superiority
of our proposed algorithm.

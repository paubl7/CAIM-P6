Known for its decentralized and tamper-aware properties, blockchain is attractive to enhance
the infrastructure of systems that have been constrained by traditionally centralized and vendor-locked
environments. Although blockchain has commonly been used as the operational model behind cryptocurrency,
it has far more foreseeable utilities in domains like healthcare, where efficient data flow is highly
demanded. Particularly, blockchain and related technologies have been touted as foundational
technologies for addressing healthcare interoperability challenges, such as promoting effective
communications and securing data exchanges across various healthcare systems. Despite the increasing
interests in leveraging blockchain technology to improve healthcare infrastructures, a major
gap in literature is the lack of available recommendations for concrete architectural styles and
design considerations for creating blockchain-based apps and systems with a healthcare focus.
This research provides two contributions to bridge the gap in existing research. First, we introduce
a pattern sequence for designing blockchain-based healthcare systems focused on secure and at-scale
data exchange. Our approach adapts traditional software patterns and proposes novel patterns
that take into account both the technical requirements specific to healthcare systems and the implications
of these requirements on naive blockchain-based solutions. Second, we provide a pattern-oriented
reference architecture using an example application of the pattern sequence for guiding software
developers to design interoperable (on the technical level) healthcare IT systems atop blockchain-based
infrastructures. The reference architecture focuses on minimizing storage requirements on-chain,
preserving the privacy of sensitive information, facilitating scalable communications, and
maximizing evolvability of the system.

Understanding human mobility is an important aspect of traffic analysis and urban planning. Trajectories
provide detailed views on specific routes, but typically do not capture all traffic. Loop detectors
capture all traffic flow at specific locations instead, but provide no information on individual
routes. Given a set of loop-detector measurements and a set of representative trajectories, our
goal is to investigate how one can effectively combine these two partial data sources to create a
more complete picture of the underlying mobility. Specifically, we want to reconstruct a realistic
set of routes from the loop-detector data, using the given trajectories as representatives of typical
behavior. We model loop-detector data as a network flow that needs to be covered by the reconstructed
routes and we capture realism of the routes via the Fr\'echet distance to the representatives. We
prove that several forms of the resulting problem are NP-hard. Hence we explore heuristics that
decompose the flow well while following the representatives to varying degrees. First we propose
the Fr\'echet Routes (FR) heuristic which generates candidates routes with bounded Fr\'echet
distance. Second we describe a variant of multi-commodity min-cost flow (MCMCF) which is loosely
coupled to the trajectories. Lastly we consider global min-cost flow (GMCF) which is essentially
agnostic to the representatives. We evaluate these approaches on synthetic and real-world trajectory
data with a map-matched ground truth. We find that GMCF explains the flow best, but produces a large
number of routes (significantly more than the ground truth); these routes are often nonsensical.
MCMCF produces a large number of mostly realistic routes which explain the flow reasonably well.
In contrast, FR produces significantly smaller sets of realistic routes that still explain the
flow well, albeit with a higher running time.

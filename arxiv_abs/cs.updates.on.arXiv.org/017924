Traffic Management in Advanced Aerial Mobility (AAM) inherits many elements of conventional Air
Traffic Management (ATM), but brings new complexities and challenges of its own. One of its ways
of guaranteeing separation is the use of airborne, stand-alone Detect-And-Avoid, an operational
concept where each aircraft decides its avoidance maneuvers independently, observing right-of-way
rules and, in specific implementations, some form of pairwise coordination. This is a fundamental
safety element for autonomous aircraft but, according to our research, is not sufficient for high-density
airspaces as envisioned for urban environments. In these environments, some way of explicit and
strategic traffic coordination must be in place, as done for conventional ATM. For efficiency reasons,
ATM is evolving to more flexible uses of the airspace, such that the use of dynamically allocated
corridors is a rising concept for AAM. These strategic forms of traffic coordination are potentially
highly efficient if the aircraft adhere to their trajectory contracts and there are no significant
perturbations to the traffic. However, if significant perturbations occur, such as loss of data
communication, or the sudden appearance of an intruder, a centralized system may not react appropriately
in due time. In busy scenarios, even small deviations from plans may compound so rapidly as to result
in large differences in the overall achieved scenario, resulting in congestions and convoluted
conflicts. Therefore, it is worth studying traffic coordination techniques that work locally
with shorter look-ahead times. To that end, we explore an airborne collaborative method for traffic
coordination, which is capable of safely solving conflicts with multiple aircraft, stressing
its capabilities throughout a large number of scenarios and comparing its performance with established
methods.

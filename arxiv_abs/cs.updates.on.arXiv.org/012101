Time series analysis is a field of data science which is interested in analyzing sequences of numerical
values ordered in time. Time series are particularly interesting because they allow us to visualize
and understand the evolution of a process over time. Their analysis can reveal trends, relationships
and similarities across the data. There exists numerous fields containing data in the form of time
series: health care (electrocardiogram, blood sugar, etc.), activity recognition, remote sensing,
finance (stock market price), industry (sensors), etc. Time series classification consists of
constructing algorithms dedicated to automatically label time series data. The sequential aspect
of time series data requires the development of algorithms that are able to harness this temporal
property, thus making the existing off-the-shelf machine learning models for traditional tabular
data suboptimal for solving the underlying task. In this context, deep learning has emerged in recent
years as one of the most effective methods for tackling the supervised classification task, particularly
in the field of computer vision. The main objective of this thesis was to study and develop deep neural
networks specifically constructed for the classification of time series data. We thus carried
out the first large scale experimental study allowing us to compare the existing deep methods and
to position them compared other non-deep learning based state-of-the-art methods. Subsequently,
we made numerous contributions in this area, notably in the context of transfer learning, data augmentation,
ensembling and adversarial attacks. Finally, we have also proposed a novel architecture, based
on the famous Inception network (Google), which ranks among the most efficient to date.

Myocardial infarction (MI), or commonly known as heart attack, is a life-threatening worldwide
health problem from which 32.4 million of people suffer each year. Early diagnosis and treatment
of MI are crucial to prevent further heart tissue damages. However, MI detection in early stages
is challenging because the symptoms are not easy to distinguish in electrocardiography findings
or biochemical marker values found in the blood. Echocardiography is a noninvasive clinical tool
for a more accurate early MI diagnosis, which is used to analyze the regional wall motion abnormalities.
When echocardiography quality is poor, the diagnosis becomes a challenging and sometimes infeasible
task even for a cardiologist. In this paper, we introduce a three-phase approach for early MI detection
in low-quality echocardiography: 1) segmentation of the entire left ventricle (LV) wall of the
heart using state-of-the-art deep learning model, 2) analysis of the segmented LV wall by feature
engineering, and 3) early MI detection. The main contributions of this study are: highly accurate
segmentation of the LV wall from low-resolution (both temporal and spatial) and noisy echocardiographic
data, generating the segmentation ground-truth at pixel-level for the unannotated dataset using
pseudo labeling approach, and composition of the first public echocardiographic dataset (HMC-QU)
labeled by the cardiologists at the Hamad Medical Corporation Hospital in Qatar. Furthermore,
the outputs of the proposed approach can significantly help cardiologists for a better assessment
of the LV wall characteristics. The proposed method is evaluated in a 5-fold cross validation scheme
on the HMC-QU dataset. The proposed approach has achieved an average level of 95.72% sensitivity
and 99.58% specificity for the LV wall segmentation, and 85.97% sensitivity, 74.03% specificity,
and 86.85% precision for MI detection.

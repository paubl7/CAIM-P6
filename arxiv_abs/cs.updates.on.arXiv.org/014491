This paper investigates reducing sub-packetization of capacity-achieving schemes for uncoded
Storage Constrained Private Information Retrieval (SC-PIR) systems. In the SC-PIR system, a user
aims to retrieve one out of $K$ files from $N$ servers while revealing nothing about its identity
to any individual server, in which the $K$ files are stored at the $N$ servers in an uncoded form and
each server can store up to $\mu K$ equivalent files, where $\mu$ is the normalized storage capacity
of each server. We first prove that there exists a capacity-achieving SC-PIR scheme for a given storage
design if and only if all the packets are stored exactly at $M\triangleq \mu N$ servers for $\mu$ such
that $M=\mu N\in\{2,3,\ldots,N\}$. Then, the optimal sub-packetization for capacity-achieving
linear SC-PIR schemes is characterized as the solution to an optimization problem, which is typically
hard to solve because of involving indicator functions. Moreover, a new notion of array called Storage
Design Array (SDA) is introduced for the SC-PIR system. With any given SDA, an associated capacity-achieving
SC-PIR scheme is constructed. Next, the SC-PIR schemes that have equal-size packets are investigated.
Furthermore, the optimal equal-size sub-packetization among all capacity-achieving linear
SC-PIR schemes characterized by Woolsey et al. is proved to be $\frac{N(M-1)}{\gcd(N,M)}$. Finally,
by allowing unequal size of packets, a greedy SDA construction is proposed, where the sub-packetization
of the associated SC-PIR scheme is upper bounded by $\frac{N(M-1)}{\gcd(N,M)}$. Among all capacity-achieving
linear SC-PIR schemes, the sub-packetization is optimal when $\min\{M,N-M\}|N$ or $M=N$, and
within a multiplicative gap $\frac{\min\{M,N-M\}}{\gcd(N,M)}$ of the optimal one otherwise.
In particular, for the case $N=d\cdot M\pm1$ where $d\geq 2$, another SDA is constructed to obtain
lower sub-packetization.

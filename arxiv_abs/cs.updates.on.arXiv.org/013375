Performance of fingerprint recognition algorithms substantially rely on fine features extracted
from fingerprints. Apart from minutiae and ridge patterns, pore features have proven to be usable
for fingerprint recognition. Although features from minutiae and ridge patterns are quite attainable
from low-resolution images, using pore features is practical only if the fingerprint image is of
high resolution which necessitates a model that enhances the image quality of the conventional
500 ppi legacy fingerprints preserving the fine details. To find a solution for recovering pore
information from low-resolution fingerprints, we adopt a joint learning-based approach that
combines both super-resolution and pore detection networks. Our modified single image Super-Resolution
Generative Adversarial Network (SRGAN) framework helps to reliably reconstruct high-resolution
fingerprint samples from low-resolution ones assisting the pore detection network to identify
pores with a high accuracy. The network jointly learns a distinctive feature representation from
a real low-resolution fingerprint sample and successfully synthesizes a high-resolution sample
from it. To add discriminative information and uniqueness for all the subjects, we have integrated
features extracted from a deep fingerprint verifier with the SRGAN quality discriminator. We also
add ridge reconstruction loss, utilizing ridge patterns to make the best use of extracted features.
Our proposed method solves the recognition problem by improving the quality of fingerprint images.
High recognition accuracy of the synthesized samples that is close to the accuracy achieved using
the original high-resolution images validate the effectiveness of our proposed model.

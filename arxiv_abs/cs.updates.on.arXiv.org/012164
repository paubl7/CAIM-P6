Patient representation learning refers to learning a dense mathematical representation of a patient
that encodes meaningful information from Electronic Health Records (EHRs). This is generally
performed using advanced deep learning methods. This study presents a systematic review of this
field and provides both qualitative and quantitative analyses from a methodological perspective.
We identified studies developing patient representations from EHRs with deep learning methods
from MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library,
and Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) Xplore Digital Library. After screening
362 articles, 48 papers were included for a comprehensive data collection. We noticed a typical
workflow starting with feeding raw data, applying deep learning models, and ending with clinical
outcome predictions as evaluations of the learned representations. Specifically, learning representations
from structured EHR data was dominant (36 out of 48 studies). Recurrent Neural Networks were widely
applied as the deep learning architecture (LSTM: 13 studies, GRU: 11 studies). Disease prediction
was the most common application and evaluation (30 studies). Benchmark datasets were mostly unavailable
(28 studies) due to privacy concerns of EHR data, and code availability was assured in 20 studies.
We show the importance and feasibility of learning comprehensive representations of patient EHR
data through a systematic review. Advances in patient representation learning techniques will
be essential for powering patient-level EHR analyses. Future work will still be devoted to leveraging
the richness and potential of available EHR data. Knowledge distillation and advanced learning
techniques will be exploited to assist the capability of learning patient representation further.

In recent years, an increased effort has been invested to improve the capabilities of robots. Nevertheless,
human-robot interaction remains a complex field of application where errors occur frequently.
The reasons for these errors can primarily be divided into two classes. Foremost, the recent increase
in capabilities also widened possible sources of errors on the robot's side. This entails problems
in the perception of the world, but also faulty behavior, based on errors in the system. Apart from
that, non-expert users frequently have incorrect assumptions about the functionality and limitations
of a robotic system. This leads to incompatibilities between the user's behavior and the functioning
of the robot's system, causing problems on the robot's side and in the human-robot interaction.
While engineers constantly improve the reliability of robots, the user's understanding about
robots and their limitations have to be addressed as well. In this work, we investigate ways to improve
the understanding about robots. For this, we employ FAMILIAR - FunctionAl user Mental model by Increased
LegIbility ARchitecture, a transparent robot architecture with regard to the robot behavior and
decision-making process. We conducted an online simulation user study to evaluate two complementary
approaches to convey and increase the knowledge about this architecture to non-expert users: a
dynamic visualization of the system's processes as well as a visual programming interface. The
results of this study reveal that visual programming improves knowledge about the architecture.
Furthermore, we show that with increased knowledge about the control architecture of the robot,
users were significantly better in reaching the interaction goal. Furthermore, we showed that
anthropomorphism may reduce interaction success.

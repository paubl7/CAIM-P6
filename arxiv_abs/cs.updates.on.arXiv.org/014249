With the rapid advancement of information and communication technologies, many researchers have
adopted alternative data sources from private data vendors to study human movement dynamics in
response to large-scale natural or societal events. Big geosocial data such as georeferenced tweets
are publicly available and dynamically evolving as real-world events are happening, making it
more likely to capture the real-time sentiments and responses of populations. However, precisely-geolocated
geosocial data is scarce and biased toward urban population centers. In this research, we developed
a big geosocial data analytical framework for extracting human movement dynamics in response to
large-scale events from publicly available georeferenced tweets. The framework includes a two-stage
data collection module that collects data in a more targeted fashion in order to mitigate the data
scarcity issue of georeferenced tweets; in addition, a variable bandwidth kernel density estimation(VB-KDE)
approach was adopted to fuse georeference information at different spatial scales, further augmenting
the signals of human movement dynamics contained in georeferenced tweets. To correct for the sampling
bias of georeferenced tweets, we adjusted the number of tweets for different spatial units (e.g.,
county, state) by population. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed analytic framework,
we chose an astronomical event that occurred nationwide across the United States, i.e., the 2017
Great American Eclipse, as an example event and studied the human movement dynamics in response
to this event. However, this analytic framework can easily be applied to other types of large-scale
events such as hurricanes or earthquakes.

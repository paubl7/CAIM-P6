Calibration plays an important role in ensuring device accuracy within safety-critical IoT deployments.
The process of calibration involves a number of parties which must collaborate to support calibration.
Calibration checks often precede safety-critical operations such as preparing a robot for surgery,
requiring inter-party interaction to complete checks. At the same time, the parties involved in
a calibration ecosystem may share an adversarial relationship with a subset of other parties. For
instance, a surgical robot manufacturer may wish to hide the identities of third-parties from the
operator (hospital), in order to maintain confidentiality of business relationships around its
robot products. Thus, information flows that reveal who-calibrates-for-whom need to be managed
to ensure confidentiality. Similarly, information about what-is-being-calibrated and how-often-it-is-calibrated
may compromise operational confidentiality. For example, calibration-verification of connected
medical devices may reveal the timing of surgical procedures and compromise PII when combined with
other meta information. We show that the challenge of managing information flows between the parties
involved in calibration cannot be met by any of the classical access control models, as any one of
them or a simple conjunction of a subset such as the lattice model fails to meet the desired access
control requirements. We demonstrate that a new unified access control model that combines BIBA,
BLP, and Chinese Walls holds rich promise. We study the case for unification, system properties,
and develop an XACML-based authorisation framework which enforces the unified model. Upon evaluation
against a baseline simple conjunction of the three models individually, our unified model outperforms
this, demonstrating it is capable of solving the novel access control challenges thrown up by digital-calibration
supply chains.

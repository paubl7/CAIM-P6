It is well known that, with a particular choice of norm, the classical double-layer potential operator
$D$ has essential norm $<1/2$ as an operator on the natural trace space $H^{1/2}(\Gamma)$ whenever
$\Gamma$ is the boundary of a bounded Lipschitz domain. This implies, for the standard second-kind
boundary integral equations for the interior and exterior Dirichlet and Neumann problems in potential
theory, convergence of the Galerkin method in $H^{1/2}(\Gamma)$ for any sequence of finite-dimensional
subspaces $(\mathcal{H}_N)_{N=1}^\infty$ that is asymptotically dense in $H^{1/2}(\Gamma)$.
Long-standing open questions are whether the essential norm is also $<1/2$ for $D$ as an operator
on $L^2(\Gamma)$ for all Lipschitz $\Gamma$ in 2-d; or whether, for all Lipschitz $\Gamma$ in 2-d
and 3-d, or at least for the smaller class of Lipschitz polyhedra in 3-d, the weaker condition holds
that the operators $\pm \frac{1}{2}I+D$ are compact perturbations of coercive operators -- this
a necessary and sufficient condition for the convergence of the Galerkin method for every sequence
of subspaces $(\mathcal{H}_N)_{N=1}^\infty$ that is asymptotically dense in $L^2(\Gamma)$.
We settle these open questions negatively. We give examples of 2-d and 3-d Lipschitz domains with
Lipschitz constant equal to one for which the essential norm of $D$ is $\geq 1/2$, and examples with
Lipschitz constant two for which the operators $\pm \frac{1}{2}I +D$ are not coercive plus compact.
We also give, for every $C>0$, examples of Lipschitz polyhedra for which the essential norm is $\geq
C$ and for which $\lambda I+D$ is not a compact perturbation of a coercive operator for any real or
complex $\lambda$ with $|\lambda|\leq C$. Finally, we resolve negatively a related open question
in the convergence theory for collocation methods.

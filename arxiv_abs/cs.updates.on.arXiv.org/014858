Tomographic image reconstruction with deep learning (DL) is an emerging field of applied artificial
intelligence, but a recent landmark study reveals that several deep reconstruction networks are
unstable for computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Since deep reconstruction
is now a mainstream approach to achieve better tomographic image quality, stabilizing deep networks
is an urgent challenge. Here we propose an Analytic Compressive Iterative Deep (ACID) framework
to address this challenge. Instead of only using DL or compressed sensing, ACID consists of four
modules: deep learning, compressed sensing-inspired sparsity promotion, analytic mapping,
and iterative refinement. This paper shows the convergence and stability of ACID under a bounded
error norm condition (a special case of the Lipschitz continuity), improves deep reconstruction
quality by stabilizing an unstable deep reconstruction network in the ACID framework, and demonstrates
the power of ACID in both stabilizing an unstable network and being resilient against adversarial
attacks to the whole ACID workflow. In our experiments, ACID eliminated all three kinds of instabilities
and significantly improved image quality in the context of the aforementioned study on the instabilities,
demonstrating that data-driven reconstruction can be stabilized to outperform reconstruction
using sparsity-regularized reconstruction alone. The mechanism of ACID is to synergize a deep
reconstruction network trained on big data, compressed sensing-based improvement with kernel
awareness, and iterative refinement to eliminate any data residual inconsistent with real data.
We anticipate that this integrative closed-loop data-driven approach helps advance deep tomographic
image reconstruction methods into clinical applications.

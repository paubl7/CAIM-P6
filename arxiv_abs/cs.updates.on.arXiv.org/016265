Studying distributed computing through the lens of algebraic topology has been the source of many
significant breakthroughs during the last two decades, especially in the design of lower bounds
or impossibility results for deterministic algorithms. This paper aims at studying randomized
synchronous distributed computing through the lens of algebraic topology. We do so by studying
the wide class of (input-free) symmetry-breaking tasks, e.g., leader election, in synchronous
fault-free anonymous systems. We show that it is possible to redefine solvability of a task "locally",
i.e., for each simplex of the protocol complex individually, without requiring any global consistency.
However, this approach has a drawback: it eliminates the topological aspect of the computation,
since a single facet has a trivial topological structure. To overcome this issue, we introduce a
"projection" $\pi$ of both protocol and output complexes, where every simplex $\sigma$ is mapped
to a complex $\pi(\sigma)$; the later has a rich structure that replaces the structure we lost by
considering one single facet at a time. To show the significance and applicability of our topological
approach, we derive necessary and sufficient conditions for solving leader election in synchronous
fault-free anonymous shared-memory and message-passing models. In both models, we consider scenarios
in which there might be correlations between the random values provided to the nodes. In particular,
different parties might have access to the same randomness source so their randomness is not independent
but equal. Interestingly, we find that solvability of leader election relates to the number of parties
that possess correlated randomness, either directly or via their greatest common divisor, depending
on the specific communication model.

The vulnerability of Face Recognition System (FRS) to various kind of attacks (both direct and in-direct
attacks) and face morphing attacks has received a great interest from the biometric community.
The goal of a morphing attack is to subvert the FRS at Automatic Border Control (ABC) gates by presenting
the Electronic Machine Readable Travel Document (eMRTD) or e-passport that is obtained based on
the morphed face image. Since the application process for the e-passport in the majority countries
requires a passport photo to be presented by the applicant, a malicious actor and the accomplice
can generate the morphed face image and to obtain the e-passport. An e-passport with a morphed face
images can be used by both the malicious actor and the accomplice to cross the border as the morphed
face image can be verified against both of them. This can result in a significant threat as a malicious
actor can cross the border without revealing the track of his/her criminal background while the
details of accomplice are recorded in the log of the access control system. This survey aims to present
a systematic overview of the progress made in the area of face morphing in terms of both morph generation
and morph detection. In this paper, we describe and illustrate various aspects of face morphing
attacks, including different techniques for generating morphed face images but also the state-of-the-art
regarding Morph Attack Detection (MAD) algorithms based on a stringent taxonomy and finally the
availability of public databases, which allow to benchmark new MAD algorithms in a reproducible
manner. The outcomes of competitions/benchmarking, vulnerability assessments and performance
evaluation metrics are also provided in a comprehensive manner. Furthermore, we discuss the open
challenges and potential future works that need to be addressed in this evolving field of biometrics.

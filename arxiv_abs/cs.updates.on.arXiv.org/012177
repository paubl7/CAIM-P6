Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a non-invasive breast cancer that can progress into invasive
ductal carcinoma (IDC). Studies suggest DCIS is often overtreated since a considerable part of
DCIS lesions may never progress into IDC. Lower grade lesions have a lower progression speed and
risk, possibly allowing treatment de-escalation. However, studies show significant inter-observer
variation in DCIS grading. Automated image analysis may provide an objective solution to address
high subjectivity of DCIS grading by pathologists. In this study, we developed a deep learning-based
DCIS grading system. It was developed using the consensus DCIS grade of three expert observers on
a dataset of 1186 DCIS lesions from 59 patients. The inter-observer agreement, measured by quadratic
weighted Cohen's kappa, was used to evaluate the system and compare its performance to that of expert
observers. We present an analysis of the lesion-level and patient-level inter-observer agreement
on an independent test set of 1001 lesions from 50 patients. The deep learning system (dl) achieved
on average slightly higher inter-observer agreement to the observers (o1, o2 and o3) ($\kappa_{o1,dl}=0.81,
\kappa_{o2,dl}=0.53, \kappa_{o3,dl}=0.40$) than the observers amongst each other ($\kappa_{o1,o2}=0.58,
\kappa_{o1,o3}=0.50, \kappa_{o2,o3}=0.42$) at the lesion-level. At the patient-level, the
deep learning system achieved similar agreement to the observers ($\kappa_{o1,dl}=0.77, \kappa_{o2,dl}=0.75,
\kappa_{o3,dl}=0.70$) as the observers amongst each other ($\kappa_{o1,o2}=0.77, \kappa_{o1,o3}=0.75,
\kappa_{o2,o3}=0.72$). In conclusion, we developed a deep learning-based DCIS grading system
that achieved a performance similar to expert observers. We believe this is the first automated
system that could assist pathologists by providing robust and reproducible second opinions on
DCIS grade.

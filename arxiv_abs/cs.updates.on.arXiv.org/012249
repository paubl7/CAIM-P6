Heat losses through the building envelope is one of the key factors in the calculation of the building
energy balance. If steady-state heat conduction is observed, which is commonly used to assess the
heat losses in building, there is an analytical solution for one-dimensional problem. For two and
three-dimensional problems, especially for the complex geometry cases, one must use numerical
methods to solve the heat conduction equation. To standardise two and three-dimensional calculation
of heat losses through building elements, ISO 10211 standard can be used. The standard has four benchmark
examples with criteria that must be satisfied to declare a method as a high-precision calculation
method. A problem occurs for Case 1 of benchmark test because the analysed problem has a singular
point due to discretely assigned Dirichlet boundary conditions. The reliability of the results
around the singular point could be improved by the refinement of the mesh in the area around the singular
point, but as a point of interest is the total heat flux that is entering the building element, and
it must converge between subdivisions, this method is not good since the reliable result cannot
be reached. The problem for the convergence is in the marginal node because the temperature gradient
in it increases as the temperature difference remains constant and the distance between the corresponding
nodes decreases. For that reason, Case 1 from the benchmark is inadequate because even if there is
a discontinuity in temperature field on the boundary, there is an interval in which this change is
to happen, and the heat flux has a theoretical limit which is not infinity. From the results of this
research, it is shown that one should neglect a certain number of singular points in order to achieve
the tolerance given by the standard since the temperature further from the marginal node is stable
for any subdivision.

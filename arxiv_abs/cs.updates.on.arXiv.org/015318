In real life auctions, a widely observed phenomenon is the winner's curse -- the winner's high bid
implies that the winner often over-estimates the value of the good for sale, resulting in an incurred
negative utility. The seminal work of Eyster and Rabin [Econometrica'05] introduced a behavioral
model aimed to explain this observed anomaly. We term agents who display this bias "cursed agents".
We adopt their model in the interdependent value setting, and aim to devise mechanisms that prevent
the cursed agents from obtaining negative utility. We design mechanisms that are cursed ex-post
IC, that is, incentivize agents to bid their true signal even though they are cursed, while ensuring
that the outcome is individually rational -- the price the agents pay is no more than the agents' true
value. Since the agents might over-estimate the good's value, such mechanisms might require the
seller to make positive transfers to the agents to prevent agents from over-paying. For revenue
maximization, we give the optimal deterministic and anonymous mechanism. For welfare maximization,
we require ex-post budget balance (EPBB), as positive transfers might lead to negative revenue.
We propose a masking operation that takes any deterministic mechanism, and imposes that the seller
would not make positive transfers, enforcing EPBB. We show that in typical settings, EPBB implies
that the mechanism cannot make any positive transfers, implying that applying the masking operation
on the fully efficient mechanism results in a socially optimal EPBB mechanism. This further implies
that if the valuation function is the maximum of agents' signals, the optimal EPBB mechanism obtains
zero welfare. In contrast, we show that for sum-concave valuations, which include weighted-sum
valuations and l_p-norms, the welfare optimal EPBB mechanism obtains half of the optimal welfare
as the number of agents grows large.

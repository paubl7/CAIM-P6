Crystal structure determines properties of materials. With the crystal structure of a chemical
substance, many physical and chemical properties can be predicted by first-principles calculations
or machine learning models. Since it is relatively easy to generate a hypothetical chemically valid
formula, crystal structure prediction becomes an important method for discovering new materials.
In our previous work, we proposed a contact map-based crystal structure prediction method, which
uses global optimization algorithms such as genetic algorithms to maximize the match between the
contact map of the predicted structure and the contact map of the real crystal structure to search
for the coordinates at the Wyckoff Positions(WP). However, when predicting the crystal structure
with high symmetry, we found that the global optimization algorithm has difficulty to find an effective
combination of WPs that satisfies the chemical formula, which is mainly caused by the inconsistency
between the dimensionality of the contact map of the predicted crystal structure and the dimensionality
of the contact map of the target crystal structure. This makes it challenging to predict the crystal
structures of high-symmetry crystals. In order to solve this problem, here we propose to use PyXtal
to generate and filter random crystal structures with given symmetry constraints based on the information
such as chemical formulas and space groups. With contact map as the optimization goal, we use differential
evolution algorithms to search for non-special coordinates at the Wyckoff positions to realize
the structure prediction of high-symmetry crystal materials. Our experimental results show that
our proposed algorithm CMCrystalHS can effectively solve the problem of inconsistent contact
map dimensions and predict the crystal structures with high symmetry.

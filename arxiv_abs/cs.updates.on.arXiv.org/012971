Background and Objective: Tuberculosis (TB) is a significant public health issue and a leading
cause of death worldwide. Millions of deaths can be averted by early diagnosis and successful treatment
of TB patients. Automated diagnosis of TB holds vast potential to assist medical experts in expediting
and improving its diagnosis, especially in developing countries like India, where there is a shortage
of trained medical experts and radiologists. To date, several deep learning based methods for automated
detection of TB from chest radiographs have been proposed. However, the performance of a few of these
methods on the Indian chest radiograph data set has been suboptimal, possibly due to different texture
of the lungs on chest radiographs of Indian subjects compared to other countries. Thus deep learning
for accurate and automated diagnosis of TB on Indian datasets remains an important subject of research.
Methods: The proposed work explores the performance of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for
the diagnosis of TB in Indian chest x-ray images. Three different pre-trained neural network models,
AlexNet, GoogLenet, and ResNet are used to classify chest x-ray images into healthy or TB infected.
The proposed approach does not require any pre-processing technique. Also, other works use pre-trained
NNs as a tool for crafting features and then apply standard classification techniques. However,
we attempt an end to end NN model based diagnosis of TB from chest x-rays. The proposed visualization
tool can also be used by radiologists in the screening of large datasets. Results: The proposed method
achieved 93.40% accuracy with 98.60% sensitivity to diagnose TB for the Indian population. Conclusions:
The performance of the proposed method is also tested against techniques described in the literature.
The proposed method outperforms the state of art on Indian and Shenzhen datasets.

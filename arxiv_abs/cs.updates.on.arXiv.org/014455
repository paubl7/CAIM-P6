Hausa language belongs to the Afroasiatic phylum, and with more first-language speakers than any
other sub-Saharan African language. With a majority of its speakers residing in the Northern and
Southern areas of Nigeria and the Republic of Niger, respectively, it is estimated that over 100
million people speak the language. Hence, making it one of the most spoken Chadic language. While
Hausa is considered well-studied and documented language among the sub-Saharan African languages,
it is viewed as a low resource language from the perspective of natural language processing (NLP)
due to limited resources to utilise in NLP-related tasks. This is common to most languages in Africa;
thus, it is crucial to enrich such languages with resources that will support and speed the pace of
conducting various downstream tasks to meet the demand of the modern society. While there exist
useful datasets, notably from news sites and religious texts, more diversity is needed in the corpus.
We provide an expansive collection of curated datasets consisting of both formal and informal forms
of the language from refutable websites and online social media networks, respectively. The collection
is large and more diverse than the existing corpora by providing the first and largest set of Hausa
social media data posts to capture the peculiarities in the language. The collection also consists
of a parallel dataset, which can be used for tasks such as machine translation with applications
in areas such as the detection of spurious or inciteful online content. We describe the curation
process -- from the collection, preprocessing and how to obtain the data -- and proffer some research
problems that could be addressed using the data.

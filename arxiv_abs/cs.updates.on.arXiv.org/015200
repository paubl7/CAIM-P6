Super-resolution (SR) methods have seen significant advances thanks to the development of convolutional
neural networks (CNNs). CNNs have been successfully employed to improve the quality of endomicroscopy
imaging. Yet, the inherent limitation of research on SR in endomicroscopy remains the lack of ground
truth high-resolution (HR) images, commonly used for both supervised training and reference-based
image quality assessment (IQA). Therefore, alternative methods, such as unsupervised SR are being
explored. To address the need for non-reference image quality improvement, we designed a novel
zero-shot super-resolution (ZSSR) approach that relies only on the endomicroscopy data to be processed
in a self-supervised manner without the need for ground-truth HR images. We tailored the proposed
pipeline to the idiosyncrasies of endomicroscopy by introducing both: a physically-motivated
Voronoi downscaling kernel accounting for the endomicroscope's irregular fibre-based sampling
pattern, and realistic noise patterns. We also took advantage of video sequences to exploit a sequence
of images for self-supervised zero-shot image quality improvement. We run ablation studies to
assess our contribution in regards to the downscaling kernel and noise simulation. We validate
our methodology on both synthetic and original data. Synthetic experiments were assessed with
reference-based IQA, while our results for original images were evaluated in a user study conducted
with both expert and non-expert observers. The results demonstrated superior performance in image
quality of ZSSR reconstructions in comparison to the baseline method. The ZSSR is also competitive
when compared to supervised single-image SR, especially being the preferred reconstruction technique
by experts.

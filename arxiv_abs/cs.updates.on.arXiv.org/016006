Broadbent and Islam (TCC '20) proposed a quantum cryptographic primitive called quantum encryption
with certified deletion. In this primitive, a receiver in possession of a quantum ciphertext can
generate a classical certificate that the encrypted message is deleted. Although their construction
is information-theoretically secure, it is limited to the setting of one-time symmetric key encryption
(SKE), where a sender and receiver have to share a common key in advance and the key can be used only
once. Moreover, the sender has to generate a quantum state and send it to the receiver over a quantum
channel in their construction. Although deletion certificates are privately verifiable, which
means a verification key for a certificate has to be kept secret, in the definition by Broadbent and
Islam, we can also consider public verifiability. In this work, we present various constructions
of encryption with certified deletion. - Quantum communication case: We achieve (reusable-key)
public key encryption (PKE) and attribute-based encryption (ABE) with certified deletion. Our
PKE scheme with certified deletion is constructed assuming the existence of IND-CPA secure PKE,
and our ABE scheme with certified deletion is constructed assuming the existence of indistinguishability
obfuscation and one-way function. These two schemes are privately verifiable. - Classical communication
case: We also achieve PKE with certified deletion that uses only classical communication. We give
two schemes, a privately verifiable one and a publicly verifiable one. The former is constructed
assuming the LWE assumption in the quantum random oracle model. The latter is constructed assuming
the existence of one-shot signatures and extractable witness encryption.

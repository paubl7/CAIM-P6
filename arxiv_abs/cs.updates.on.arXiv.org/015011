A smart city improves operational efficiency and comfort of living by harnessing techniques such
as the Internet of Things (IoT) to collect and process data for decision making. To better support
smart cities, data collected by IoT should be stored and processed appropriately. However, IoT
devices are often task-specialized and resource-constrained, and thus, they heavily rely on online
resources in terms of computing and storage to accomplish various tasks. Moreover, these cloud-based
solutions often centralize the resources and are far away from the end IoTs and cannot respond to
users in time due to network congestion when massive numbers of tasks offload through the core network.
Therefore, by decentralizing resources spatially close to IoT devices, mobile edge computing
(MEC) can reduce latency and improve service quality for a smart city, where service requests can
be fulfilled in proximity. As the service demands exhibit spatial-temporal features, deploying
MEC servers at optimal locations and allocating MEC resources play an essential role in efficiently
meeting service requirements in a smart city. In this regard, it is essential to learn the distribution
of resource demands in time and space. In this work, we first propose a spatio-temporal Bayesian
hierarchical learning approach to learn and predict the distribution of MEC resource demand over
space and time to facilitate MEC deployment and resource management. Second, the proposed model
is trained and tested on real-world data, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can
achieve very high accuracy. Third, we demonstrate an application of the proposed method by simulating
task offloading. Finally, the simulated results show that resources allocated based upon our models'
predictions are exploited more efficiently than the resources are equally divided into all servers
in unobserved areas.

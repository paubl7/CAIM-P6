Effective and rapid detection of lesions in the Gastrointestinal tract is critical to gastroenterologist's
response to some life-threatening diseases. Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) has revolutionized
traditional endoscopy procedure by allowing gastroenterologists visualize the entire GI tract
non-invasively. Once the tiny capsule is swallowed, it sequentially capture images of the GI tract
at about 2 to 6 frames per second (fps). A single video can last up to 8 hours producing between 30,000
to 100,000 images. Automating the detection of frames containing specific lesion in WCE video would
relieve gastroenterologists the arduous task of reviewing the entire video before making diagnosis.
While the WCE produces large volume of images, only about 5\% of the frames contain lesions that aid
the diagnosis process. Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based models have been very successful
in various image classification tasks. However, they suffer excessive parameters, are sample
inefficient and rely on very large amount of training data. Deploying a CNN classifier for lesion
detection task will require time-to-time fine-tuning to generalize to any unforeseen category.
In this paper, we propose a metric-based learning framework followed by a few-shot lesion recognition
in WCE data. Metric-based learning is a meta-learning framework designed to establish similarity
or dissimilarity between concepts while few-shot learning (FSL) aims to identify new concepts
from only a small number of examples. We train a feature extractor to learn a representation for different
small bowel lesions using metric-based learning. At the testing stage, the category of an unseen
sample is predicted from only a few support examples, thereby allowing the model to generalize to
a new category that has never been seen before. We demonstrated the efficacy of this method on real
patient capsule endoscopy data.

Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is the most common renal cancer in adults. The histopathologic classification
of RCC is essential for diagnosis, prognosis, and management of patients. Reorganization and classification
of complex histologic patterns of RCC on biopsy and surgical resection slides under a microscope
remains a heavily specialized, error-prone, and time-consuming task for pathologists. In this
study, we developed a deep neural network model that can accurately classify digitized surgical
resection slides and biopsy slides into five related classes: clear cell RCC, papillary RCC, chromophobe
RCC, renal oncocytoma, and normal. In addition to the whole-slide classification pipeline, we
visualized the identified indicative regions and features on slides for classification by reprocessing
patch-level classification results to ensure the explainability of our diagnostic model. We evaluated
our model on independent test sets of 78 surgical resection whole slides and 79 biopsy slides from
our tertiary medical institution, and 69 randomly selected surgical resection slides from The
Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. The average area under the curve (AUC) of our classifier on
the internal resection slides, internal biopsy slides, and external TCGA slides is 0.98, 0.98 and
0.99, respectively. Our results suggest that the high generalizability of our approach across
different data sources and specimen types. More importantly, our model has the potential to assist
pathologists by (1) automatically pre-screening slides to reduce false-negative cases, (2) highlighting
regions of importance on digitized slides to accelerate diagnosis, and (3) providing objective
and accurate diagnosis as the second opinion.

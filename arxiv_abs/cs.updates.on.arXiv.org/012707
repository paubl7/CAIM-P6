Provided with mobile edge computing (MEC) services, wireless devices (WDs) no longer have to experience
long latency in running their desired programs locally, but can pay to offload computation tasks
to the edge server. Given its limited storage space, it is important for the edge server at the base
station (BS) to determine which service programs to cache by meeting and guiding WDs' offloading
decisions. In this paper, we propose an MEC service pricing scheme to coordinate with the service
caching decisions and control WDs' task offloading behavior. We propose a two-stage dynamic game
of incomplete information to model and analyze the two-stage interaction between the BS and multiple
associated WDs. Specifically, in Stage I, the BS determines the MEC service caching and announces
the service program prices to the WDs, with the objective to maximize its expected profit under both
storage and computation resource constraints. In Stage II, given the prices of different service
programs, each WD selfishly decides its offloading decision to minimize individual service delay
and cost, without knowing the other WDs' desired program types or local execution delays. Despite
the lack of WD's information and the coupling of all the WDs' offloading decisions, we derive the
optimal threshold-based offloading policy that can be easily adopted by the WDs in Stage II at the
Bayesian equilibrium. Then, by predicting the WDs' offloading equilibrium, we jointly optimize
the BS' pricing and service caching in Stage I via a low-complexity algorithm. In particular, we
study both the uniform and differentiated pricing schemes. For differentiated pricing, we prove
that the same price should be charged to the cached programs of the same workload.

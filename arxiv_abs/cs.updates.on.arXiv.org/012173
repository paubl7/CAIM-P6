We present "Pix2Prof", a deep learning model that eliminates manual steps in the measurement of
galaxy surface brightness (SB) profiles. We argue that a galaxy "profile" of any sort is conceptually
similar to an image caption. This idea allows us to leverage image captioning methods from the field
of natural language processing, and so we design Pix2Prof as a float sequence "captioning" model
suitable for SB profile inferral. We demonstrate the technique by approximating the galaxy SB fitting
method described by Courteau (1996), an algorithm with several manual steps. We use g, r, and i-band
images from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 10 (DR10) to train Pix2Prof on 5367 image--SB
profile pairs. We test Pix2Prof on 300 SDSS DR10 galaxy image--SB profile pairs in each of the g, r,
and i bands to calibrate the mean SB deviation between interactive manual measurements and automated
extractions, and demonstrate the effectiveness of Pix2Prof in mirroring the manual method. Pix2Prof
processes $\sim1$ image per second on an Intel Xeon E5-2650 v3 and $\sim2$ images per second on a NVIDIA
TESLA V100, improving on the speed of the manual interactive method by more than two orders of magnitude.
Crucially, Pix2Prof requires no manual interaction, and since galaxy profile estimation is an
embarrassingly parallel problem, we can further increase the throughput by running many Pix2Prof
instances simultaneously. In perspective, Pix2Prof would take under an hour to infer profiles
for $10^5$ galaxies on a single NVIDIA DGX-2 system. A single human expert would take approximately
two years to complete the same task. Automated methodology such as this will accelerate the analysis
of the next generation of large area sky surveys expected to yield hundreds of millions of targets.
In such instances, all manual approaches -- even those involving a large number of experts -- would
be impractical.

Problem-driven visualization work is rooted in deeply understanding the data, actors, processes,
and workflows of a target domain. However, an individual's personality traits and cognitive abilities
may also influence visualization use. Diverse user needs and abilities raise natural questions
for specificity in visualization design: Could individuals from different domains exhibit performance
differences when using visualizations? Are any systematic variations related to their cognitive
abilities? This study bridges domain-specific perspectives on visualization design with those
provided by cognition and perception. We measure variations in visualization task performance
across chemistry, computer science, and education, and relate these differences to variations
in spatial ability. We conducted an online study with over 60 domain experts consisting of tasks
related to pie charts, isocontour plots, and 3D scatterplots, and grounded by a well-documented
spatial ability test. Task performance (correctness) varied with profession across more complex
visualizations, but not pie charts, a comparatively common visualization. We found that correctness
correlates with spatial ability, and the professions differ in terms of spatial ability. These
results indicate that domains differ not only in the specifics of their data and tasks, but also in
terms of how effectively their constituent members engage with visualizations and their cognitive
traits. Analyzing participants' confidence and strategy comments suggests that focusing on performance
neglects important nuances, such as differing approaches to engage with even common visualizations
and potential skill transference. Our findings offer a fresh perspective on discipline-specific
visualization with recommendations to help guide visualization design that celebrates the uniqueness
of the disciplines and individuals we seek to serve.

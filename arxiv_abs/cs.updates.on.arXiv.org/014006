Despite dedicated effort and research in the last two decades, the entrepreneurship field is still
limited by little evidence-based knowledge of the impacts of entrepreneurship programs on the
entrepreneurial intention of students in pre-university levels of study. Further, gender equity
continues to be an issue in the entrepreneurial sector, particularly in STEM-focused entrepreneurship.
In this context, this study was designed to explore the effects of a one-day female-focused STEM-based
entrepreneurship program (for brevity, we call it the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program) on the
entrepreneurial intention of secondary school female students. The study collected data from
two surveys completed by 193 secondary school female students, aged 14-16 years, who participated
in the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program. This program encouraged girls to develop and implement
creative computational solutions to socially relevant problems, with an Internet of Things (IoT)
component using the micro:bit device. The findings reveal that a key factor in the development of
entrepreneurial attitudes in young female students is associated with soft-skills development,
particularly in the areas of creative thinking, risk-taking, problem-solving, and leadership
development. The importance of meaningful human connections, including positive role modelling
and peer to peer learning were also important factors in fostering entrepreneurial intent. With
these factors in mind, our findings highlight that the OzGirlsEntrepreneurship program substantially
increased the entrepreneurial intention of secondary school female students. In addition, this
study offers actionable implications and recommendations to develop and deliver entrepreneurship
education programs for secondary school level students.

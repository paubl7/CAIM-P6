Currently, Android malware detection is mostly performed on server side against the increasing
number of malware. Powerful computing resource provides more exhaustive protection for app markets
than maintaining detection by a single user. However, apart from the applications provided by the
official market, apps from unofficial markets and third-party resources are always causing serious
security threats to end-users. Meanwhile, it is a time-consuming task if the app is downloaded first
and then uploaded to the server side for detection, because the network transmission has a lot of
overhead. In addition, the uploading process also suffers from the security threats of attackers.
Consequently, a last line of defense on mobile devices is necessary and much-needed. In this paper,
we propose an effective Android malware detection system, MobiTive, leveraging customized deep
neural networks to provide a real-time and responsive detection environment on mobile devices.
MobiTive is a preinstalled solution rather than an app scanning and monitoring engine using after
installation, which is more practical and secure. Original deep learning models cannot be directly
deployed and executed on mobile devices due to various performance limitations, such as computation
power, memory size, and energy. Therefore, we evaluate and investigate the following key points:(1)
the performance of different feature extraction methods based on source code or binary code;(2)
the performance of different feature type selections for deep learning on mobile devices;(3) the
detection accuracy of different deep neural networks on mobile devices;(4) the real-time detection
performance and accuracy on different mobile devices;(5) the potential based on the evolution
trend of mobile devices' specifications; and finally we further propose a practical solution (MobiTive)
to detect Android malware on mobile devices.

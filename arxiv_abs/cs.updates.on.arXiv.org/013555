This study presents an analysis of the most recent literature addressing global software engineering
(GSE). We examine the current state of GSE research using a new Systematic Snapshot Mapping (SSM)
technique. We analysed 275 papers published between January 2011 and June 2012 in peer-reviewed
conferences, journals and workshops. Our results provide a coarse-grained overview of the very
recent literature addressing GSE, by classifying studies into predefined categories. We also
follow and extend several prior classifications to support our synthesis of the data. Our results
reveal that currently GSE studies are focused on Management and Infrastructure related factors.
Most of the studies are conducted at the organizational level using methods such as interviews,
surveys, field studies and case studies. We use inter-country network analysis to confirm that
the USA and India are major players in GSE, with USA-India collaborations being the most frequently
studied, followed by USA-China. Specific groups of countries have dominated the reported GSE project
locations. In contrast, regions including Central Asia, South Asia (except India), Africa and
South East Asia have not been covered in these studies. While a considerable number of GSE-related
studies have been published they are currently quite narrowly focused on exploratory research
and explanatory theories. The critical research paradigm has been untouched, perhaps due to a lack
of criteria and principles for carrying out such research in GSE. An absence of formulative research,
experimentation and simulation, and a comparative focus on evaluative approaches, all suggest
that existing tools, methods and approaches from related fields are being tested in the GSE context.
However, these solutions may not scale to cover GSE-related issues or may overlook factors/facets
specific to GSE.

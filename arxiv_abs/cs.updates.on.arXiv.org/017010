Simulation of unsteady creeping flows in complex geometries has traditionally required the use
of a time-stepping procedure, which is typically costly and unscalable. To reduce the cost and allow
for computations at much larger scales, we propose an alternative approach that is formulated based
on the unsteady Stokes equation expressed in the time-spectral domain. This transformation results
in a boundary value problem with an imaginary source term proportional to the computed mode that
is discretized and solved in a complex-valued finite element solver using Bubnov-Galerkin formulation.
This transformed spatio-spectral formulation presents several advantages over the traditional
spatio-temporal techniques. Firstly, for cases with boundary conditions varying smoothly in
time, it provides a significant saving in computational cost as it can resolve time-variation of
the solution using a few modes rather than thousands of time steps. Secondly, in contrast to the traditional
time integration scheme with a finite order of accuracy, this method exhibits a super convergence
behavior versus the number of computed modes. Thirdly, in contrast to the stabilized finite element
methods for fluid, no stabilization term is employed in our formulation, producing a solution that
is consistent and more accurate. Fourthly, the proposed approach is embarrassingly parallelizable
owing to the independence of the solution modes, thus enabling scalable calculations at a much larger
number of processors. The comparison of the proposed technique against a standard stabilized finite
element solver is performed using two- and three-dimensional canonical and complex geometries.
The results show that the proposed method can produce more accurate results at 1% to 11% of the cost
of the standard technique for the studied cases.

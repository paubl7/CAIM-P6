Participation of women in Open Source Software (OSS) is very unbalanced, despite various efforts
to improve diversity. This is concerning not only because women do not get the chance of career and
skill developments afforded by OSS, but also because OSS projects suffer from a lack of diversity
of thoughts because of a lack of diversity in their projects. Studies that characterize women's
participation and investigate how to attract and retain women are spread across multiple fields,
including information systems, software engineering, and social science. This paper systematically
maps, aggregates, and synthesizes the state-of-the-art on women's participation in Open Source
Software. It focuses on women's representation and the demographics of women who contribute to
OSS, how they contribute, the acceptance rates of their contributions, their motivations and challenges,
and strategies employed by communities to attract and retain women. We identified 51 articles (published
between 2005 and 2021) that investigate women's participation in OSS. According to the literature,
women represent about 9.8\% of OSS contributors; most of them are recent contributors, 20-37 years
old, devote less than 5h/week to OSS, and make both non-code and code contributions. Only 5\% of projects
have women as core developers, and women author less than 5\% of pull-requests but have similar or
even higher rates of merge acceptance than men. Besides learning new skills and altruism, reciprocity
and kinship are motivations especially relevant for women but can leave if they are not compensated
for their contributions. Women's challenges are mainly social, including lack of peer parity and
non-inclusive communication from a toxic culture. The literature reports ten strategies, which
were mapped to six of the seven challenges. Based on these results, we provide guidelines for future
research and practice.

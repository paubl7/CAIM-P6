Facial analysis permits many investigations some of the most important of which are craniofacial
identification, facial recognition, and age and sex estimation. In forensics, photo-anthropometry
describes the study of facial growth and allows the identification of patterns in facial skull development
by using a group of cephalometric landmarks to estimate anthropological information. In several
areas, automation of manual procedures has achieved advantages over and similar measurement confidence
as a forensic expert. This manuscript presents an approach using photo-anthropometric indexes,
generated from frontal faces cephalometric landmarks, to create an artificial neural network
classifier that allows the estimation of anthropological information, in this specific case age
and sex. The work is focused on four tasks: i) sex estimation over ages from 5 to 22 years old, evaluating
the interference of age on sex estimation; ii) age estimation from photo-anthropometric indexes
for four age intervals (1 year, 2 years, 4 years and 5 years); iii) age group estimation for thresholds
of over 14 and over 18 years old; and; iv) the provision of a new data set, available for academic purposes
only, with a large and complete set of facial photo-anthropometric points marked and checked by
forensic experts, measured from over 18,000 faces of individuals from Brazil over the last 4 years.
The proposed classifier obtained significant results, using this new data set, for the sex estimation
of individuals over 14 years old, achieving accuracy values greater than 0.85 by the F_1 measure.
For age estimation, the accuracy results are 0.72 for measure with an age interval of 5 years. For
the age group estimation, the measures of accuracy are greater than 0.93 and 0.83 for thresholds
of 14 and 18 years, respectively.

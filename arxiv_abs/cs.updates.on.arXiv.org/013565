This paper studies the problem of distributed beam scheduling for 5G millimeter-Wave (mm-Wave)
cellular networks where base stations (BSs) belonging to different operators share the same spectrum
without centralized coordination among them. Our goal is to design efficient distributed scheduling
algorithms to maximize the network utility, which is a function of the achieved throughput by the
user equipment (UEs), subject to average and instantaneous power consumption constraints of the
BSs. We propose a Media Access Control (MAC) and a power allocation/adaptation mechanism utilizing
the Lyapunov stochastic optimization framework and non-cooperative game theory. In particular,
we first transform the original utility maximization problem into two sub-optimization problems
for each time frame, which are a convex optimization problem and a non-convex optimization problem,
respectively. By formulating the distributed scheduling problem as a non-cooperative game in
which each BS is a player attempting to optimize its own utility, we provide a distributed solution
to the non-convex sub-optimization problem via finding the Nash Equilibrium (NE) of the scheduling
game. We prove the existence of NE and provide sufficient conditions guaranteeing the uniqueness
of NE by utilizing the equivalence between the non-cooperative game and the Variational Inequality
(VI) problem. A corresponding parallel updating algorithm for finding the NE is proposed which
is proved to globally converge. Finally, we conduct simulation under various network settings
to show the effectiveness of the proposed game based beam scheduling algorithm in comparison to
that of several baseline MAC schemes including p-persistent and CSMA/CA MAC protocols.

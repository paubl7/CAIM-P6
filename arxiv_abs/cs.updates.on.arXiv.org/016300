In this paper we present the first deterministic polynomial time algorithm for determining the
existence of a Hamiltonian cycle and finding a Hamiltonian cycle in general graphs. Our algorithm
can also resolve the Hamiltonian path problem in the traceable graphs. The space complexity of our
algorithm is O(n^4). The time complexity are theoretically O(n^5*d^2) on average and O(n^6*d^2)
in the worst case respectively, where d is the maximum degree of vertex. With parallel computing,
the space complexity can be improved to O(n^3) and the time complexity to O(n^3*d^2) on average and
O(n^4*d^2) in the worst case. We construct the corresponding path hologram transformed from the
original graph and compute the path set, which is a collection of segment sets consisting of all the
vertices located on the same segment layer among all the longest basic paths, of every vertex with
dynamic programming. The path hologram is a multi-segment graph with the vertex <u, k> where u is
a vertex and k is the segment layer of u in the path hologram. To ensure each path stored in the path set
is legal and each segment set of the path set contains only valid vertices, the key strategy of our
method is the "consecutive" deleting-replenishing operations recursively on the left/right
action field of a vertex, respectively. The greatest contribution of our method is the path set in
which all the legal paths can be stored in O(n^2) space for a complete graph of order n. In fact, our
algorithm can be directly applied to the original graph. Besides, our algorithm can deal with the
finite general graphs including undirected, directed, and mixed. As a result, the well-known problem
HCP in NPC can be now resolved practically in deterministic polynomial time for general graphs in
the worst case.

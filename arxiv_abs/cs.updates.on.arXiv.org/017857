Universities in developing countries, including those in Nigeria, experience cybercrime risks
due to poor management of their cyber spaces and resources. The outcome of these cybercrimes are
threats and breaches of universities' cyber security. The threats and breaches have resulted in
substantial financial, social, and intellectual property losses. In the recent past, Nigerian
universities have started to respond to these cyber-attacks. Many of them now invest in anti-cybercrime
tools and programs to mitigate cyber security threats and breaches. Despite this, the number of
times Nigerian universities suffer from cyber-attacks and the losses that result from them keeps
increasing. Our observation, however, indicates that most Nigerian universities run their cyber
security without using scientifically derived frameworks that spell out how to manage threats
and breaches that emanate from within and outside them. We consider this a problem to ongoing efforts
made by Nigerian universities to mitigate cyber security threats and breaches. The study reported
in this paper was therefore, carried out to explicate how Nigerian universities can develop actionable
frameworks that can help them to mitigate cyber security threats and breaches. The study is based
on literature review and propose how an actionable framework that Nigerian Universities can adopt
to setoff cybersecurity programs can be developed. The process comprises of problem identification,
description of objectives, designing and developing the artefact, testing, and evaluating the
artefact, and communicating the result. We conclude that the framework provides a lucrative starting
point for Nigerian universities to setoff efficient and effective cyber security program.

The integration of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) tools into mechanical devices
found in aviation industry has raised security concerns. The more integrated the system, the more
vulnerable due to the inherent vulnerabilities found in ICT tools and software that drives the system.
The security concerns have become more heightened as the concept of electronic-enabled aircraft
and smart airports get refined and implemented underway. In line with the above, this paper undertakes
a review of cyber-security incidence in the aviation sector over the last 20 years. The essence is
to understand the common threat actors, their motivations, the type of attacks, aviation infrastructure
that is commonly attacked and then match these so as to provide insight on the current state of the
cyber-security in the aviation sector. The review showed that the industry's threats come mainly
from Advance Persistent Threat (APT) groups that work in collaboration with some state actors to
steal intellectual property and intelligence, in order to advance their domestic aerospace capabilities
as well as possibly monitor, infiltrate and subvert other nations' capabilities. The segment of
the aviation industry commonly attacked is the Information Technology infrastructure, and the
prominent type of attacks is malicious hacking activities that aim at gaining unauthorised access
using known malicious password cracking techniques such as Brute force attacks, Dictionary attacks
and so on. The review further analysed the different attack surfaces that exist in aviation industry,
threat dynamics, and use these dynamics to predict future trends of cyberattacks in the industry.
The aim is to provide information for the cybersecurity professionals and aviation stakeholders
for proactive actions in protecting these critical infrastructures against cyberincidence for
an optimal customer service oriented industry.

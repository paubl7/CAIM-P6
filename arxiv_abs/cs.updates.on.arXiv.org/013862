The dairy industry uses clover and grass as fodder for cows. Accurate estimation of grass and clover
biomass yield enables smart decisions in optimizing fertilization and seeding density, resulting
in increased productivity and positive environmental impact. Grass and clover are usually planted
together, since clover is a nitrogen-fixing plant that brings nutrients to the soil. Adjusting
the right percentages of clover and grass in a field reduces the need for external fertilization.
Existing approaches for estimating the grass-clover composition of a field are expensive and time
consuming - random samples of the pasture are clipped and then the components are physically separated
to weigh and calculate percentages of dry grass, clover and weeds in each sample. There is growing
interest in developing novel deep learning based approaches to non-destructively extract pasture
phenotype indicators and biomass yield predictions of different plant species from agricultural
imagery collected from the field. Providing these indicators and predictions from images alone
remains a significant challenge. Heavy occlusions in the dense mixture of grass, clover and weeds
make it difficult to estimate each component accurately. Moreover, although supervised deep learning
models perform well with large datasets, it is tedious to acquire large and diverse collections
of field images with precise ground truth for different biomass yields. In this paper, we demonstrate
that applying data augmentation and transfer learning is effective in predicting multi-target
biomass percentages of different plant species, even with a small training dataset. The scheme
proposed in this paper used a training set of only 261 images and provided predictions of biomass
percentages of grass, clover, white clover, red clover, and weeds with mean absolute error of 6.77%,
6.92%, 6.21%, 6.89%, and 4.80% respectively.

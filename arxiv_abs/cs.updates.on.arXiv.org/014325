Electronic nose proves its effectiveness in alternativeherbal medicine classification, but
due to the supervised learn-ing nature, previous research relies on the labelled training data,which
are time-costly and labor-intensive to collect. Consideringthe training data inadequacy in real-world
applications, this studyaims to improve classification accuracy via data augmentationstrategies.
We stimulated two scenarios to investigate the effective-ness of five data augmentation strategies
under different trainingdata inadequacy: in the noise-free scenario, different availability
ofunlabelled data were simulated, and in the noisy scenario, differentlevels of Gaussian noises
and translational shifts were added tosimulate sensor drifts. The augmentation strategies: noise-addingdata
augmentation, semi-supervised learning, classifier-based online learning, inductive conformal
prediction (ICP) onlinelearning and the novel ensemble ICP online learning proposed in this study,
were compared against supervised learningbaseline, with Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
and Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the classifiers. We found thatat least one strategies significantly
improved the classification accuracy with LDA(p<=0.05) and showed non-decreasingclassification
accuracy with SVM in each tasks. Moreover, our novel strategy: ensemble ICP online learning outperformedthe
others by showing non-decreasing classification accuracy on all tasks and significant improvement
on most tasks(25/36 tasks,p<=0.05). This study provides a systematic analysis over augmentation
strategies, and we provided userswith recommended strategies under specific circumstances.
Furthermore, our newly proposed strategy showed botheffectiveness and robustness in boosting
the classification model generalizability, which can also be further employed inother machine
learning applications.

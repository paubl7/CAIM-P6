Floating offshore structures often exhibit low-frequency oscillatory motions in the horizontal
plane, with amplitudes in the same order as their characteristic dimensions and larger than the
corresponding wave-frequency responses, making the traditional formulations in an inertial
coordinate system inconsistent and less applicable. To address this issue, we explore an alternative
formulation completely based on a non-inertial body-fixed coordinate system. Unlike the traditional
seakeeping models, this formulation consistently allows for large-amplitude horizontal motions.
A numerical model based on a higher-order boundary element is applied to solve the resulting boundary-value
problems in the time domain. A new set of explicit time-integration methods, which do not necessitate
the use of upwind schemes for spatial derivatives, are designed to deal with the convective-type
free-surface conditions. To suppress the weak saw-tooth instabilities on the free surface in time
marching, we also present novel low-pass filters based on optimized weighted-least-squares,
which are in principle applicable for both structured and unstructured meshes. For ship seakeeping
and added resistance analyses, we show that the present computational model does not need to use
soft-springs for surge and sway, in contrast to the traditional models. For a spar floating offshore
wind turbine (FOWT), the importance of consistently taking into account the effects of large horizontal
motions is demonstrated considering the bi-chromatic incident waves. The present model is also
referred to as a complete 2nd order wave-load model, as all the 2nd order wave loads, including the
sum-frequency and difference-frequency components, are solved simultaneously.

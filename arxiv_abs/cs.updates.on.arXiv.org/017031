Hyperspectral pansharpening aims to synthesize a low-resolution hyperspectral image (LR-HSI)
with a registered panchromatic image (PAN) to generate an enhanced HSI with high spectral and spatial
resolution. Recently proposed HS pansharpening methods have obtained remarkable results using
deep convolutional networks (ConvNets), which typically consist of three steps: (1) up-sampling
the LR-HSI, (2) predicting the residual image via a ConvNet, and (3) obtaining the final fused HSI
by adding the outputs from first and second steps. Recent methods have leveraged Deep Image Prior
(DIP) to up-sample the LR-HSI due to its excellent ability to preserve both spatial and spectral
information, without learning from large data sets. However, we observed that the quality of up-sampled
HSIs can be further improved by introducing an additional spatial-domain constraint to the conventional
spectral-domain energy function. We define our spatial-domain constraint as the $L_1$ distance
between the predicted PAN image and the actual PAN image. To estimate the PAN image of the up-sampled
HSI, we also propose a learnable spectral response function (SRF). Moreover, we noticed that the
residual image between the up-sampled HSI and the reference HSI mainly consists of edge information
and very fine structures. In order to accurately estimate fine information, we propose a novel over-complete
network, called HyperKite, which focuses on learning high-level features by constraining the
receptive from increasing in the deep layers. We perform experiments on three HSI datasets to demonstrate
the superiority of our DIP-HyperKite over the state-of-the-art pansharpening methods. The deployment
codes, pre-trained models, and final fusion outputs of our DIP-HyperKite and the methods used for
the comparisons will be publicly made available at https://github.com/wgcban/DIP-HyperKite.git.

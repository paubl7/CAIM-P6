The main risk-limiting ballot polling audit in use today, BRAVO, is designed for use when single
ballots are drawn at random and a decision regarding whether to stop the audit or draw another ballot
is taken after each ballot draw (ballot-by-ballot (B2) audits). On the other hand, real ballot polling
audits draw many ballots in a single round before determining whether to stop (round-by-round (R2)
audits). We show that BRAVO results in significant inefficiency when directly applied to real R2
audits. We present the ATHENA class of R2 stopping rules, which we show are risk-limiting if the round
schedule is pre-determined (before the audit begins). We prove that each rule is at least as efficient
as the corresponding BRAVO stopping rule applied at the end of the round. We have open-source software
libraries implementing most of our results. We show that ATHENA halves the number of ballots required,
for all state margins in the 2016 US Presidential election and a first round with $90\%$ stopping
probability, when compared to BRAVO (stopping rule applied at the end of the round). We present simulation
results supporting the 90% stopping probability claims and our claims for the risk accrued in the
first round. Further, ATHENA reduces the number of ballots by more than a quarter for low margins,
when compared to the BRAVO stopping rule applied on ballots in selection order. This implies that
keeping track of the order when drawing ballots R2 is not beneficial, because ATHENA is more efficient
even without information on selection order. These results are significant because current approaches
to real ballot polling election audits use the B2 BRAVO rules, requiring about twice as much work
on the part of election officials. Applying the rules in selection order requires fewer ballots,
but keeping track of the order, and entering it into audit software, adds to the effort.

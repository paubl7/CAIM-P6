The Smart Grid System (SGS) is a joint network comprising the power and the communication network.
In this paper, the underlying intra-and-interdependencies between entities for a given SGS is
captured using a dependency model called Modified Implicative Interdependency Model (MIIM) [1].
Given an integer K, the K-contingency list problem gives the list of K-most critical entities, failure
of which maximizes the network damage at the current time. The problem being NP complete [2] and owing
to the higher running time of the given Integer Linear Programming (ILP) based solution [3], a much
faster heuristic solution to generate an event driven self-updating K-contingency list [4] is
also given in this paper. Based on the contingency lists obtained from both the solutions, this paper
proposes an adaptive entity hardening technique based on a leader-follower game theoretic approach
that arrests the cascading failure of entities in the SGS after an initial failure of entities. The
validation of the work is done by comparing the contingency lists using both types of solutions,
obtained for different K values using the MIIM model on a smart grid of IEEE 14-Bus system with that
obtained by simulating the smart grid using a co-simulation system formed by MATPOWER and Java Network
Simulator (JNS). The K-contingency list obtained for a smart grid of IEEE 14-Bus system also indicate
that the network damage predicted by both the ILP based solution and heuristic solution using MIIM
are more realistic compared to that obtained using another dependency model called Implicative
Interdependency Model (IIM) [2]. Advantage of using the MIIM based heuristic solution is also shown
in this paper when larger SGS of IEEE 118-Bus is considered. Finally, it is shown how the adaptive
hardening helps in improving the network performance.

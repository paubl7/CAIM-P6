A rapidly changing electricity sector requires adjusted and new ancillary services, which enable
the secure and reliable operation of the electricity system. However, assessments and policy advice
regarding ancillary services and market design lack methods to evaluate the complex interaction
of markets and services. Therefore, this paper contributes an open-source agent-based model to
test design options for ancillary services and electricity markets. The Ancillary Services Acquisition
Model (ASAM) combines the agent-based modeling framework MESA with the toolbox Python for Power
System Analysis (PyPSA). The model provides various design parameters per market and agent-specific
strategies as well as detailed clearing algorithms for the day-ahead market, intra-day continuous
trading, redispatch, and imbalances. Moreover, ASAM includes numerous policy performance indicators,
including a novel price mark-up indicator and novel redispatch performance indicators. A stylized
simulation scenario verified and validated the model and addressed a redispatch design question.
The results displayed the following implications from order types in redispatch markets with multi-period
all-or-none design: (1) The order design provides few risks for market parties, as orders are fully
cleared. (2) Large orders may lead to dispatch ramps before and after the delivery period and may
cause ramp-risk mark-ups as well as additional trading of imbalances on intra-day. (3) All-or-none
design in a liquid situation leads to the over-procurement of redispatch by the grid operator, as
orders cannot be partially activated. Moreover, it is likely that the grid operator induces imbalances
to the system by incomplete redispatch activation (i.e. upward and downward redispatch volumes
are not equal).

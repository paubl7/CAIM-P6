Bayesian inference is a principled framework for dealing with uncertainty. The practitioner can
perform an initial assumption for the physical phenomenon they want to model (prior belief), collect
some data and then adjust the initial assumption in the light of the new evidence (posterior belief).
Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) methods, also known as likelihood-free inference techniques,
are a class of models used for performing inference when the likelihood is intractable. The unique
requirement of these models is a black-box sampling machine. Due to the modelling-freedom they
provide these approaches are particularly captivating. Robust Optimisation Monte Carlo (ROMC)
is one of the most recent techniques of the specific domain. It approximates the posterior distribution
by solving independent optimisation problems. This dissertation focuses on the implementation
of the ROMC method in the software package Engine for Likelihood-Free Inference (ELFI). In the first
chapters, we provide the mathematical formulation and the algorithmic description of the ROMC
approach. In the following chapters, we describe our implementation; (a) we present all the functionalities
provided to the user and (b) we demonstrate how to perform inference on some real examples. Our implementation
provides a robust and efficient solution to a practitioner who wants to perform inference on a simulator-based
model. Furthermore, it exploits parallel processing for accelerating the inference wherever
it is possible. Finally, it has been designed to serve extensibility; the user can easily replace
specific subparts of the method without significant overhead on the development side. Therefore,
it can be used by a researcher for further experimentation.

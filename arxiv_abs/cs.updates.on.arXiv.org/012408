The Earth Observation planning community has access to tools that can propagate orbits and compute
coverage of Earth observing imagers with customizable shapes and orientation, model the expected
Earth Reflectance at various bands, epochs and directions, generate simplified instrument performance
metrics for imagers and radars, and schedule single and multiple spacecraft payload operations.
We are working toward integrating existing tools to design a planner that allows commercial small
spacecraft to assess the opportunities for cross-calibration of their sensors against current
satellite to be calibrated, specifications of the reference instruments, sensor stability, allowable
latency between calibration measurements, differences in viewing and solar geometry between
calibration measurements, etc. The planner would output cross-calibration opportunities for
every reference target pair as a function of flexible user-defined parameters. We use a preliminary
version of this planner to inform the design of a constellation of transfer radiometers that can
serve as stable, radiometric references for commercial sensors to cross-calibrate with. We propose
such a constellation for either vicarious cross-calibration using pre-selected sites, or top
of the atmosphere (TOA) cross-calibration globally. Results from the calibration planner applied
to a subset of informed architecture designs show that a 4 sat constellation provides multiple calibration
opportunities within half a day planning horizon, for Cubesat sensors deployed into a typical rideshare
orbits. While such opportunities are available for cross calibration image pairs within 5 deg of
solar or view directions, and with-in an hour (for TOA) and less than a day (vicariously), the planner
allows us to identify many more by relaxing user-defined restrictions.

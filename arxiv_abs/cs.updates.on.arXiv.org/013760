Resource management in Internet of Things (IoT) systems is a major challenge due to the massive scale
and heterogeneity of the IoT system. For instance, most IoT applications require timely delivery
of collected information, which is a key challenge for the IoT. In this paper, novel centralized
and distributed resource allocation schemes are proposed to enable IoT devices to share limited
communication resources and to transmit IoT messages in a timely manner. In the considered system,
the timeliness of information is captured using non-linear age of information (AoI) metrics that
can naturally quantify the freshness of information. To model the inherent heterogeneity of the
IoT system, the non-linear aging functions are defined in terms of IoT device types and message content.
To minimize AoI, the proposed resource management schemes allocate the limited communication
resources considering AoI. In particular, the proposed centralized scheme enables the base station
to learn the device types and to determine aging functions. Moreover, the proposed distributed
scheme enables the devices to share the limited communication resources based on available information
on other devices and their AoI. The convergence of the proposed distributed scheme is proved, and
the effectiveness in reducing the AoI with partial information is analyzed. Simulation results
show that the proposed centralized scheme achieves significantly lower average instantaneous
AoI when compared to simple centralized allocation without learning, while the proposed distributed
scheme achieves significantly lower average instantaneous AoI when compared to random allocation.
The results also show that the proposed centralized scheme outperforms the proposed distributed
scheme in almost all cases, but the distributed approach is more viable for a massive IoT.

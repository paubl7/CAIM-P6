In the coming smart ocean era, reliable and efficient communications are crucial for promoting
a variety of maritime activities. Current maritime communication networks (MCNs) mainly rely
on marine satellites and on-shore base stations (BSs). The former generally provides limited transmission
rate, while the latter lacks wide-area coverage capability. Due to these facts, the state-of-the-art
MCN falls far behind terrestrial fifth-generation (5G) networks. To fill up the gap in the coming
sixth-generation (6G) era, we explore the benefit of deployable BSs for maritime coverage enhancement.
Both unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and mobile vessels are used to configure deployable BSs. This
leads to a hierarchical satellite-UAV-terrestrial network on the ocean. We address the joint link
scheduling and rate adaptation problem for this hybrid network, to minimize the total energy consumption
with quality of service (QoS) guarantees. Different from previous studies, we use only the large-scale
channel state information (CSI), which is location-dependent and thus can be predicted through
the position information of each UAV/vessel based on its specific trajectory/shipping lane. The
problem is shown to be an NP-hard mixed integer nonlinear programming problem with a group of hidden
non-linear equality constraints. We solve it suboptimally by using Min-Max transformation and
iterative problem relaxation, leading to a process-oriented joint link scheduling and rate adaptation
scheme. As observed by simulations, the scheme can provide agile on-demand coverage for all users
with much reduced system overhead and a polynomial computation complexity. Moreover, it can achieve
a prominent performance close to the optimal solution.

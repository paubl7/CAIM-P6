The development of Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) has made significant progress in the last years. An
important aspect in the development of AVs is the assessment of their safety. New approaches need
to be worked out. Among these, real-world scenario-based assessment is widely supported by many
players in the automotive field. Scenario-based assessment allows for using virtual simulation
tools in addition to physical tests, such as on a test track, proving ground, or public road. We propose
a procedure for real-world scenario-based road-approval assessment considering three stakeholders:
the applicant, the assessor, and the (road or vehicle) authority. The challenges are as follows.
Firstly, the tests need to be tailored to the operational design domain (ODD) and dynamic driving
task (DDT) description of the AV. Secondly, it is assumed that the applicant does not want to disclose
all of the detailed test results because of proprietary or confidential information contained
in these results. Thirdly, due to the complex ODD and DDT, many test scenarios are required to obtain
sufficient confidence in the assessment of the AV. Consequently, it is assumed that due to limited
resources, it is infeasible for the assessor to conduct all (physical) tests. We propose a systematic
approach for determining the tests that are based on the requirements set by the authority and the
AV's ODD and DDT description, such that the tests are tailored to the applicable ODD and DDT. Each
test comes with metrics that enables the applicant to provide a performance rating of the AV for each
of the tests. By only providing a performance rating for each test, the applicant does not need to
disclose the details of the test results. In our proposed procedure, the assessor only conducts
a limited number of tests. The main purpose of these tests is to verify the fidelity of the results
provided by the applicant.

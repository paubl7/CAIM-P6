This dissertation proposes two solutions for urban traffic control in the presence of connected
and automated vehicles. First a centralized platoon-based controller is proposed for the cooperative
intersection management problem that takes advantage of the platooning systems and V2I communication
to generate fast and smooth traffic flow at a single intersection. Second, a data-driven approach
is proposed for adaptive signal control in the presence of connected vehicles. The proposed system
relies on a data-driven method for optimal signal timing and a data-driven heuristic method for
estimating routing decisions. It requires no additional sensors to be installed at the intersection,
reducing the installation costs compared to typical settings of state-of-the-practice adaptive
signal controllers. The proposed traffic controller contains an optimal signal timing module
and a traffic state estimator. The signal timing module is a neural network model trained on microscopic
simulation data to achieve optimal results according to a given performance metric such as vehicular
delay or average queue length. The traffic state estimator relies on connected vehicles' information
to estimate the traffic's routing decisions. A heuristic method is proposed to minimize the estimation
error. With sufficient parameter tuning, the estimation error decreases as the market penetration
rate (MPR) of connected vehicles grows. Estimation error is below 30% for an MPR of 10% and it shrinks
below 20% when MPR grows larger than 30%. Simulations showed that the proposed traffic controller
outperforms Highway Capacity Manual's methodology and given proper offline parameter tuning,
it can decrease average vehicular delay by up to 25%.

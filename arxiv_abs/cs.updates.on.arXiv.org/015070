Diabetes is a metabolic disorder that results from defects in autoimmune beta-cell destruction
in Type 1, peripheral resistance to insulin action in Type 2 or, most commonly, both. Patients with
long-standing diabetes often fall prey to Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) resulting in changes in the
retina of the human eye, which may lead to loss of vision in extreme cases. The aim of this study is two-fold:
(a) create deep learning models that were trained to grade degraded retinal fundus images and (b)
to create a browser-based application that will aid in diagnostic procedures by highlighting the
key features of the fundus image. Deep learning has proven to be a success for computer-aided DR diagnosis
resulting in early-detection and prevention of blindness. In this research work, we have emulated
the images plagued by distortions by degrading the images based on multiple different combinations
of Light Transmission Disturbance, Image Blurring and insertion of Retinal Artifacts. These degraded
images were used for the training of multiple Deep Learning based Convolutional Neural Networks.
We have trained InceptionV3, ResNet-50 and InceptionResNetV2 on multiple datasets. The models
were used to classify retinal fundus images based on their severity level and then further used in
the creation of a browser-based application, which demonstrates the models prediction and the
probability associated with each class. It will also show the Integration Gradient (IG) Attribution
Mask superimposed onto the input image. The creation of the browser-based application would aid
in the diagnostic procedures performed by ophthalmologists by highlighting the key features of
the fundus image based on an educated prediction made by the model.

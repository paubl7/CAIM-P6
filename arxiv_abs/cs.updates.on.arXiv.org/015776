Social media has been remarkably grown during the past few years. Nowadays, posting messages on
social media websites has become one of the most popular Internet activities. The vast amount of
user-generated content has made social media the most extensive data source of public opinion.
Sentiment analysis is one of the techniques used to analyze user-generated data. The Persian language
has specific features and thereby requires unique methods and models to be adopted for sentiment
analysis, which are different from those in English language. Sentiment analysis in each language
has specified prerequisites; hence, the direct use of methods, tools, and resources developed
for English language in Persian has its limitations. The main target of this paper is to provide a
comprehensive literature survey for state-of-the-art advances in Persian sentiment analysis.
In this regard, the present study aims to investigate and compare the previous sentiment analysis
studies on Persian texts and describe contributions presented in articles published in the last
decade. First, the levels, approaches, and tasks for sentiment analysis are described. Then, a
detailed survey of the sentiment analysis methods used for Persian texts is presented, and previous
relevant works on Persian Language are discussed. Moreover, we present in this survey the authentic
and published standard sentiment analysis resources and advances that have been done for Persian
sentiment analysis. Finally, according to the state-of-the-art development of English sentiment
analysis, some issues and challenges not being addressed in Persian texts are listed, and some guidelines
and trends are provided for future research on Persian texts. The paper provides information to
help new or established researchers in the field as well as industry developers who aim to deploy
an operational complete sentiment analysis system.

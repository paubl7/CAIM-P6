Management education scholarship has long outlined the need to enhance student engagement and
participation in business schools, using more innovative teaching practices. This is increasingly
motivating scholars to strive for more collaborative pedagogic dynamics between teachers and
students. At the same time, research into co-creation of Game Based Learning material such as board
games has largely focused on the value added to games when educators involve students in the design
process. However there has been scant research examining the qualities of co-creational game design
exercises as teaching experiences themselves, thus overlooking the opportunity to conceptualise
such activities as an innovative teaching tool that can help educators facilitate student engagement
and participation. To address this research gap, this paper presents a case study where Project
Management students participated in two co-creation workshops designing educational Project
Management games. Data were collected conducting focus groups at the end of the two workshops. Throughout
the paper we have sought to present some positive outcomes of such processes as well as some critical
points that emerged through the data that were collected. Mentionable outcomes include a series
of positive characteristics of co-creative Game Based Learning activities like enhanced engagement
as well as a list of challenges when facilitating such activities. The main findings of this research
have been organised in two frameworks, one outlining five positive characteristics of co-creative
Game Based Learning activities: engagement with knowledge, knowledge assessment, creativity,
communication and the second outlining challenges in facilitating such activities: lack of focus,
lack of structure and the need for more practice-oriented games.

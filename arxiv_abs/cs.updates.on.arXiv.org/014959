The introduction of fully-actuated multirotors has opened the door to new possibilities and more
efficient solutions to many real-world applications. However, their integration had been slower
than expected, partly due to the need for new tools to take full advantage of these robots. As far as
we know, all the groups currently working on the fully-actuated multirotors develop new full-pose
(6-D) tools and methods to use their robots, which is inefficient, time-consuming, and requires
many resources. We propose a way of bridging the gap between the tools already available for underactuated
robots and the new fully-actuated vehicles. The approach can extend the existing underactuated
flight controllers to support the fully-actuated robots, or enhance the existing fully-actuated
controllers to support existing underactuated flight stacks. We introduce attitude strategies
that work with the underactuated controllers, tools, planners and remote control interfaces,
all while allowing taking advantage of the full actuation. Moreover, new methods are proposed that
can properly handle the limited lateral thrust suffered by many fully-actuated UAV designs. The
strategies are lightweight, simple, and allow rapid integration of the available tools with these
new vehicles for the fast development of new real-world applications. The real experiments on our
robots and simulations on several UAV architectures with different underlying controller methods
show how these strategies can be utilized to extend existing flight controllers for fully-actuated
applications. We have provided the source code for the PX4 firmware enhanced with our proposed methods
to showcase an example flight controller for underactuated multirotors that can be modified to
seamlessly support fully-actuated vehicles while retaining the rest of the flight stack unchanged.

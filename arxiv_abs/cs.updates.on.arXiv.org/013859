Leveraging recent advances on mobile edge computing (MEC), edge intelligence has emerged as a promising
paradigm to support mobile artificial intelligent (AI) applications at the network edge. In this
paper, we consider the AI service placement problem in a multi-user MEC system, where the access
point (AP) places the most up-to-date AI program at user devices to enable local computing/task
execution at the user side. To fully utilize the stringent wireless spectrum and edge computing
resources, the AP sends the AI service program to a user only when enabling local computing at the
user yields a better system performance. We formulate a mixed-integer non-linear programming
(MINLP) problem to minimize the total computation time and energy consumption of all users by jointly
optimizing the service placement (i.e., which users to receive the program) and resource allocation
(on local CPU frequencies, uplink bandwidth, and edge CPU frequency). To tackle the MINLP problem,
we derive analytical expressions to calculate the optimal resource allocation decisions with
low complexity. This allows us to efficiently obtain the optimal service placement solution by
search-based algorithms such as meta-heuristic or greedy search algorithms. To enhance the algorithm
scalability in large-sized networks, we further propose an ADMM (alternating direction method
of multipliers) based method to decompose the optimization problem into parallel tractable MINLP
subproblems. The ADMM method eliminates the need of searching in a high-dimensional space for service
placement decisions and thus has a low computational complexity that grows linearly with the number
of users. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithms perform extremely close to the optimum
and significantly outperform the other representative benchmark algorithms.

${\bf Purpose}$: Earlier work showed that IVIM-NET$_{orig}$, an unsupervised physics-informed
deep neural network, was faster and more accurate than other state-of-the-art intravoxel-incoherent
motion (IVIM) fitting approaches to DWI. This study presents: IVIM-NET$_{optim}$, overcoming
IVIM-NET$_{orig}$'s shortcomings. ${\bf Method}$: In simulations (SNR=20), the accuracy, independence
and consistency of IVIM-NET were evaluated for combinations of hyperparameters (fit S0, constraints,
network architecture, # hidden layers, dropout, batch normalization, learning rate), by calculating
the NRMSE, Spearman's $\rho$, and the coefficient of variation (CV$_{NET}$), respectively. The
best performing network, IVIM-NET$_{optim}$ was compared to least squares (LS) and a Bayesian
approach at different SNRs. IVIM-NET$_{optim}$'s performance was evaluated in 23 pancreatic
ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) patients. 14 of the patients received no treatment between 2 repeated
scan sessions and 9 received chemoradiotherapy between sessions. Intersession within-subject
standard deviations (wSD) and treatment-induced changes were assessed. ${\bf Results}$: In simulations,
IVIM-NET$_{optim}$ outperformed IVIM-NET$_{orig}$ in accuracy (NRMSE(D)=0.14 vs 0.17; NMRSE(f)=0.26
vs 0.31; NMRSE(D*)=0.46 vs 0.49), independence ($\rho$(D*,f)=0.32 vs 0.95) and consistency (CV$_{NET}$
(D)=0.028 vs 0.185; CV$_{NET}$ (f)=0.025 vs 0.078; CV$_{NET}$ (D*)=0.075 vs 0.144). IVIM-NET$_{optim}$
showed superior performance to the LS and Bayesian approaches at SNRs<50. In vivo, IVIM-NET$_{optim}$
showed less noisy and more detailed parameter maps with lower wSD for D and f than the alternatives.
In the treated cohort, IVIM-NET$_{optim}$ detected the most individual patients with significant
parameter changes compared to day-to-day variations. ${\bf Conclusion}$: IVIM-NET$_{optim}$
is recommended for accurate IVIM fitting to DWI data.

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been widely used for the representation learning of various structured
graph data, typically through message passing among nodes by aggregating their neighborhood information
via different operations. While promising, most existing GNNs oversimplified the complexity
and diversity of the edges in the graph, and thus inefficient to cope with ubiquitous heterogeneous
graphs, which are typically in the form of multi-relational graph representations. In this paper,
we propose RioGNN, a novel Reinforced, recursive and flexible neighborhood selection guided multi-relational
Graph Neural Network architecture, to navigate complexity of neural network structures whilst
maintaining relation-dependent representations. We first construct a multi-relational graph,
according to the practical task, to reflect the heterogeneity of nodes, edges, attributes and labels.
To avoid the embedding over-assimilation among different types of nodes, we employ a label-aware
neural similarity measure to ascertain the most similar neighbors based on node attributes. A reinforced
relation-aware neighbor selection mechanism is developed to choose the most similar neighbors
of a targeting node within a relation before aggregating all neighborhood information from different
relations to obtain the eventual node embedding. Particularly, to improve the efficiency of neighbor
selecting, we propose a new recursive and scalable reinforcement learning framework with estimable
depth and width for different scales of multi-relational graphs. RioGNN can learn more discriminative
node embedding with enhanced explainability due to the recognition of individual importance of
each relation via the filtering threshold mechanism.

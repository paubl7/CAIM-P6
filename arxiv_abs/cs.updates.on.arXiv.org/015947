This paper investigates the low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) problem from a generic vantage point.
Unlike most existing work that has focused on recovering a low-rank matrix from a subset of the entries
with specified values, the only information available here is just the pattern (i.e., positions)
of observed entries. To be precise, given is an $n\times m$ pattern matrix ($n\le m$) whose entries
take fixed zero, unknown generic values, and missing values that are free to be chosen from the complex
field, the question of interest is whether there is a matrix completion with rank no more than $n-k$
($k\ge 1$) for almost all values of the unknown generic entries, which is called the generic low-rank
matrix completion (GLRMC) associated with $({\cal M},k)$, and abbreviated as GLRMC$({\cal M},k)$.
Leveraging an elementary tool from the theory on systems of polynomial equations, we give a simple
proof for genericity of this problem, which was first observed by $Kir\'aly et al.$, that is, depending
on the pattern of the observed entries, the answer is either yes or no, for almost all realizations
of the unknown generic entries. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions ensuring feasibility
of GLRMC$({\cal M},1)$. Aso, we provide a sufficient condition and a necessary condition (which
we conjecture to be sufficient too) for the general case (i.e., $k\ge 1$). In the following, two randomized
algorithms are presented to determine upper and lower bounds for the generic minimum completion
rank. Our approaches are based on the algebraic geometry theory, and a novel basis preservation
principle discovered herein. Finally, numerical simulations are given to corroborate the theoretical
findings and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.

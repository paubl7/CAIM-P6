In this paper, we present a self-training method, named ST3D++, with a holistic pseudo label denoising
pipeline for unsupervised domain adaptation on 3D object detection. ST3D++ aims at reducing noise
in pseudo label generation as well as alleviating the negative impacts of noisy pseudo labels on
model training. First, ST3D++ pre-trains the 3D object detector on the labeled source domain with
random object scaling (ROS) which is designed to reduce target domain pseudo label noise arising
from object scale bias of the source domain. Then, the detector is progressively improved through
alternating between generating pseudo labels and training the object detector with pseudo-labeled
target domain data. Here, we equip the pseudo label generation process with a hybrid quality-aware
triplet memory to improve the quality and stability of generated pseudo labels. Meanwhile, in the
model training stage, we propose a source data assisted training strategy and a curriculum data
augmentation policy to effectively rectify noisy gradient directions and avoid model over-fitting
to noisy pseudo labeled data. These specific designs enable the detector to be trained on meticulously
refined pseudo labeled target data with denoised training signals, and thus effectively facilitate
adapting an object detector to a target domain without requiring annotations. Finally, our method
is assessed on four 3D benchmark datasets (i.e., Waymo, KITTI, Lyft, and nuScenes) for three common
categories (i.e., car, pedestrian and bicycle). ST3D++ achieves state-of-the-art performance
on all evaluated settings, outperforming the corresponding baseline by a large margin (e.g., 9.6%
$\sim$ 38.16% on Waymo $\rightarrow$ KITTI in terms of AP$_{\text{3D}}$), and even surpasses the
fully supervised oracle results on the KITTI 3D object detection benchmark with target prior. Code
will be available.

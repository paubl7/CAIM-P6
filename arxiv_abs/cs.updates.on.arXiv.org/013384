Medical image processing is one of the most important topics in the field of the Internet of Medical
Things (IoMT). Recently, deep learning methods have carried out state-of-the-art performances
on medical image tasks. However, conventional deep learning have two main drawbacks: 1) insufficient
training data and 2) the domain mismatch between the training data and the testing data. In this paper,
we propose a distant domain transfer learning (DDTL) method for medical image classification.
Moreover, we apply our methods to a recent issue (Coronavirus diagnose). Several current studies
indicate that lung Computed Tomography (CT) images can be used for a fast and accurate COVID-19 diagnosis.
However, the well-labeled training data cannot be easily accessed due to the novelty of the disease
and a number of privacy policies. Moreover, the proposed method has two components: Reduced-size
Unet Segmentation model and Distant Feature Fusion (DFF) classification model. It is related to
a not well-investigated but important transfer learning problem, termed Distant Domain Transfer
Learning (DDTL). DDTL aims to make efficient transfers even when the domains or the tasks are entirely
different. In this study, we develop a DDTL model for COVID-19 diagnose using unlabeled Office-31,
Catech-256, and chest X-ray image data sets as the source data, and a small set of COVID-19 lung CT
as the target data. The main contributions of this study: 1) the proposed method benefits from unlabeled
data collected from distant domains which can be easily accessed, 2) it can effectively handle the
distribution shift between the training data and the testing data, 3) it has achieved 96\% classification
accuracy, which is 13\% higher classification accuracy than "non-transfer" algorithms, and 8\%
higher than existing transfer and distant transfer algorithms.

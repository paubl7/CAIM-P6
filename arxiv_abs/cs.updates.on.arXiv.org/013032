A prophet inequality states, for some $\alpha\in[0,1]$, that the expected value achievable by
a gambler who sequentially observes random variables $X_1,\dots,X_n$ and selects one of them is
at least an $\alpha$ fraction of the maximum value in the sequence. We obtain three distinct improvements
for a setting that was first studied by Correa et al. (EC, 2019) and is particularly relevant to modern
applications in algorithmic pricing. In this setting, the random variables are i.i.d. from an unknown
distribution and the gambler has access to an additional $\beta n$ samples for some $\beta\geq 0$.
We first give improved lower bounds on $\alpha$ for a wide range of values of $\beta$; specifically,
$\alpha\geq(1+\beta)/e$ when $\beta\leq 1/(e-1)$, which is tight, and $\alpha\geq 0.648$ when
$\beta=1$, which improves on a bound of around $0.635$ due to Correa et al. (SODA, 2020). Adding to
their practical appeal, specifically in the context of algorithmic pricing, we then show that the
new bounds can be obtained even in a streaming model of computation and thus in situations where the
use of relevant data is complicated by the sheer amount of data available. We finally establish that
the upper bound of $1/e$ for the case without samples is robust to additional information about the
distribution, and applies also to sequences of i.i.d. random variables whose distribution is itself
drawn, according to a known distribution, from a finite set of known candidate distributions. This
implies a tight prophet inequality for exchangeable sequences of random variables, answering
a question of Hill and Kertz (Contemporary Mathematics, 1992), but leaves open the possibility
of better guarantees when the number of candidate distributions is small, a setting we believe is
of strong interest to applications.

In most websites, the online rating system provides the ratings of products and services to users.
Lack of trust in data integrity and its manipulation has hindered fulfilling user satisfaction.
Since existing online rating systems deal with a central server, all rating data is stored on the
central server. Therefore, all rating data can be removed, modified, and manipulated by the system
manager to change the ratings in favor of the service or product provider. In this paper, an online
rating system using distributed ledger technologies has been presented as the proposed system
to solve all the weaknesses of current systems. Distributed ledger technologies are completely
decentralized and there is no centralization on them by any institution. Distributed ledger technologies
have different variants. Among distributed ledger technologies, blockchain technology has been
used in the proposed rating system because of its support for smart contracts. In the proposed online
rating system, the Ethereum platform has been chosen from different blockchain platforms that
have a public permission network. In this system, the raters cannot rate unless they submit a request
to the system and be authorized to take part in the online product rating process. The important feature
of the Ethereum platform is its support for smart contracts, which can be used to write the rating
contract in the Solidity language. Also, using Proof of Authority consensus mechanisms, all rating
transactions are approved by the surveyors. Since in the real Ethereum system, each rating transaction
is sent to the network by the raters, some gas must be paid for each rating transaction. However, since
this method is expensive, TestNet blockchain can be used in the rating system. Finally, the proposed
rating system was used for rating the restaurants of a website and its features were tested.

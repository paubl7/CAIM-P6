Purpose Automated detection of region of interest (ROI) is a critical step for many medical image
applications such as heart ROIs detection in perfusion MRI images, lung boundary detection in chest
X-rays, and femoral head detection in pelvic radiographs. Thus, we proposed a practical framework
of ROIs detection in medical images, with a case study for hip detection in anteroposterior (AP)
pelvic radiographs. Materials and Methods: We conducted a retrospective study which analyzed
hip joints seen on 7,399 AP pelvic radiographs from three diverse sources, including 4,290 high
resolution radiographs from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital Osteoarthritis, 3,008 low to medium
resolution radiographs from Osteoarthritis Initiative, and 101 heterogeneous radiographs from
Google image search engine. We presented a deep learning-based ROI detection framework utilizing
single-shot multi-box detector (SSD) with ResNet-101 backbone and customized head structure
based on the characteristics of the obtained datasets, whose ground truths were labeled by non-medical
annotators in a simple graphical interface. Results: Our method achieved average intersection
over union (IoU)=0.8115, average confidence=0.9812, and average precision with threshold IoU=0.5
(AP50)=0.9901 in the independent test set, suggesting that the detected hip regions have appropriately
covered main features of the hip joints. Conclusion: The proposed approach featured on low-cost
labeling, data-driven model design, and heterogeneous data testing. We have demonstrated the
feasibility of training a robust hip region detector for AP pelvic radiographs. This practical
framework has a promising potential for a wide range of medical image applications.

Introduction- Identifying the potential firing patterns following different brain regions under
normal and abnormal conditions increases our understanding of events at the level of neural interactions
in the brain. The Izhikevich model is one of the simplest biologically plausible models, i.e. capable
of capturing the most recognized firing patterns of neurons. This property makes the model efficient
in simulating the large-scale networks of neurons. Improving the Izhikevich model for adapting
to the neuronal activity of the rat brain with great accuracy would make the model effective for future
neural network implementations. Methods- Data sampling from two brain regions, the HIP and BLA,
was performed by the extracellular recordings of male rats, and spike sorting was conducted by Plexon
offline sorter. Further analyses were performed through NeuroExplorer and MATLAB. To optimize
the Izhikevich model parameters, a genetic algorithm was used. The process of comparison in each
iteration leads to the survival of better populations until achieving the optimum solution. Results-
In the present study, the possible firing patterns of the real single neurons of the HIP and BLA were
identified. Additionally, an improved Izhikevich model was achieved. Accordingly, the real neuronal
spiking pattern of these regions neurons and the corresponding cases of the Izhikevich neuron spiking
pattern were adjusted with great accuracy. Conclusion- This study was conducted to elevate our
knowledge of neural interactions in different structures of the brain and accelerate the quality
of future large-scale neural network simulations, as well as reducing the modeling complexity.
This aim was achievable by performing the improved Izhikevich model, and inserting only the plausible
firing patterns, and eliminating unrealistic ones.

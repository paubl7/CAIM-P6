For a function $\mathsf{K} : \mathbb{R}^{d} \times \mathbb{R}^{d} \to \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}$,
and a set $P = \{ x_1, \ldots, x_n\} \subset \mathbb{R}^d$ of $n$ points, the $\mathsf{K}$ graph $G_P$
of $P$ is the complete graph on $n$ nodes where the weight between nodes $i$ and $j$ is given by $\mathsf{K}(x_i,
x_j)$. In this paper, we initiate the study of when efficient spectral graph theory is possible on
these graphs. We investigate whether or not it is possible to solve the following problems in $n^{1+o(1)}$
time for a $\mathsf{K}$-graph $G_P$ when $d < n^{o(1)}$: $\bullet$ Multiply a given vector by the
adjacency matrix or Laplacian matrix of $G_P$ $\bullet$ Find a spectral sparsifier of $G_P$ $\bullet$
Solve a Laplacian system in $G_P$'s Laplacian matrix For each of these problems, we consider all
functions of the form $\mathsf{K}(u,v) = f(\|u-v\|_2^2)$ for a function $f:\mathbb{R} \rightarrow
\mathbb{R}$. We provide algorithms and comparable hardness results for many such $\mathsf{K}$,
including the Gaussian kernel, Neural tangent kernels, and more. For example, in dimension $d =
\Omega(\log n)$, we show that there is a parameter associated with the function $f$ for which low
parameter values imply $n^{1+o(1)}$ time algorithms for all three of these problems and high parameter
values imply the nonexistence of subquadratic time algorithms assuming Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis ($\mathsf{SETH}$), given natural assumptions on $f$. As part of our results, we also
show that the exponential dependence on the dimension $d$ in the celebrated fast multipole method
of Greengard and Rokhlin cannot be improved, assuming $\mathsf{SETH}$, for a broad class of functions
$f$. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first formal limitation proven about fast multipole
methods.

Display technology must offer high dynamic range (HDR) contrast-based depth induction and 3D personalization
simultaneously. Efficient algorithms to compress HDR stereo data is critical. Direct capturing
of HDR content is complicated due to the high expense and scarcity of HDR cameras. The HDR 3D images
could be generated in low-cost by fusing low-dynamic-range (LDR) images acquired using a stereo
camera with various exposure settings. In this paper, an efficient scheme for coding multi-exposure
stereo images is proposed based on a tensor low-rank approximation scheme. The multi-exposure
fusion can be realized to generate HDR stereo output at the decoder for increased realism and exaggerated
binocular 3D depth cues. For exploiting spatial redundancy in LDR stereo images, the stack of multi-exposure
stereo images is decomposed into a set of projection matrices and a core tensor following an alternating
least squares Tucker decomposition model. The compact, low-rank representation of the scene,
thus, generated is further processed by 3D extension of High Efficiency Video Coding standard.
The encoding with 3D-HEVC enhance the proposed scheme efficiency by exploiting intra-frame, inter-view
and the inter-component redundancies in low-rank approximated representation. We consider constant
luminance property of IPT and Y'CbCr color space to precisely approximate intensity prediction
and perceptually minimize the encoding distortion. Besides, the proposed scheme gives flexibility
to adjust the bitrate of tensor latent components by changing the rank of core tensor and its quantization.
Extensive experiments on natural scenes demonstrate that the proposed scheme outperforms state-of-the-art
JPEG-XT and 3D-HEVC range coding standards.

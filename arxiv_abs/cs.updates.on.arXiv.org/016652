This paper aims to answer the research question as to optimal design of decision-making processes
for autonomous vehicles (AVs), including dynamical selection of driving velocity and route choices
on a transportation network. Dynamic traffic assignment (DTA) has been widely used to model travelers's
route choice or/and departure-time choice and predict dynamic traffic flow evolution in the short
term. However, the existing DTA models do not explicitly describe one's selection of driving velocity
on a road link. Driving velocity choice may not be crucial for modeling the movement of human drivers
but it is a must-have control to maneuver AVs. In this paper, we aim to develop a game-theoretic model
to solve for AVs's optimal driving strategies of velocity control in the interior of a road link and
route choice at a junction node. To this end, we will first reinterpret the DTA problem as an N-car
differential game and show that this game can be tackled with a general mean field game-theoretic
framework. The developed mean field game is challenging to solve because of the forward and backward
structure for velocity control and the complementarity conditions for route choice. An efficient
algorithm is developed to address these challenges. The model and the algorithm are illustrated
on the Braess network and the OW network with a single destination. On the Braess network, we first
compare the LWR based DTA model with the proposed game and find that the driving and routing control
navigates AVs with overall lower costs. We then compare the total travel cost without and with the
middle link and find that the Braess paradox may still arise under certain conditions. We also test
our proposed model and solution algorithm on the OW network.

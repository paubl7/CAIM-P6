We consider the problem of sampling an arbitrary given motif $H$ in a graph $G$, where access to $G$
is given via queries: degree, neighbor, and pair, as well as uniform edge sample queries. Previous
algorithms for the uniform sampling task were based on a decomposition of $H$ into a collection of
odd cycles and stars, denoted $\mathcal{D}^*(H)=\{O_{k_1}, \ldots, O_{k_q}, S_{p_1}, \ldots,
S_{p_\ell}\}$. These algorithms were shown to be optimal for the case where $H$ is a clique or an odd-length
cycle, but no other lower bounds were known. We present a new algorithm for sampling arbitrary motifs
which, up to $\poly(\log n)$ factors, for any motif $H$ whose decomposition contains at least two
components or at least one star, is always preferable. The main ingredient leading to this improvement
is an improved uniform algorithm for sampling stars, which might be of independent interest, as
it allows to sample vertices according to the $p$-th moment of the degree distribution. We further
show how to use our sampling algorithm to get an approximate counting algorithm, with essentially
the same complexity. Finally, we prove that this algorithm is \emph{decomposition-optimal} for
decompositions that contain at least one odd cycle. That is, we prove that for any decomposition
$D$ that contains at least one odd cycle, there exists a motif $H_{D}$ with decomposition $D$, and
a family of graphs $\mathcal{G}$, so that in order to output a uniform copy of $H$ in a uniformly chosen
graph in $\mathcal{G}$, the number of required queries matches our upper bound. These are the first
lower bounds for motifs $H$ with a nontrivial decomposition, i.e., motifs that have more than a single
component in their decomposition.

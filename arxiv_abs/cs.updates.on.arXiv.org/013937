Context: As Industrial Cyber-Physical Systems (ICPS) become more connected and widely-distributed,
often operating in safety-critical environments, we require innovative approaches to detect
and diagnose the faults that occur in them. Objective: We profile fault identification and diagnosis
techniques employed in the aerospace, automotive, and industrial control domains. By examining
both theoretical presentations as well as case studies from production environments, we present
a profile of the current approaches being employed and identify gaps. Methodology: A scoping study
was used to identify and compare fault detection and diagnosis methodologies that are presented
in the current literature. Results: Fault identification and analysis studies from 127 papers
published from 2004 to 2019 reveal a wide diversity of promising techniques, both emerging and in-use.
These range from traditional Physics-based Models to Data-Driven Artificial Intelligence (AI)
and Knowledge-Based approaches. Predictive diagnostics or prognostics featured prominently
across all sectors, along with discussions of techniques including Fault trees, Petri nets and
Markov approaches. We also profile some of the techniques that have reached the highest Technology
Readiness Levels, showing how those methods are being applied in real-world environments beyond
the laboratory. Conclusions: Our results suggest that the continuing wide use of both Model-Based
and Data-Driven AI techniques across all domains, especially when they are used together in hybrid
configuration, reflects the complexity of the current ICPS application space. While creating
sufficiently-complete models is labor intensive, Model-free AI techniques were evidenced as
a viable way of addressing aspects of this challenge, demonstrating the increasing sophistication
of current machine learning systems.(Abridged)

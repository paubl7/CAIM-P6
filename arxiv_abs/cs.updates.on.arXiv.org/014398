Most works in IRS-assisted systems have ignored the impact of the inevitable residual hardware
impairments (HWIs) at both the transceiver hardware and the IRS while any relevant works have addressed
only simple scenarios, e.g., with single-antenna network nodes and/or without taking the randomness
of phase noise at the IRS into account. In this work, we aim at filling up this gap by considering a general
IRS-assisted multi-user (MU) multiple-input single-output (MISO) system with imperfect CSI
and correlated Rayleigh fading. In parallel, we present a general computationally efficient methodology
for IRS reflect beamforming (RB) optimization. Specifically, we introduce an advantageous channel
estimation (CE) method for such systems accounting for the HWIs. Moreover, we derive the uplink
achievable spectral efficiency (SE) with maximal-ratio combining (MRC) receiver, displaying
three significant advantages being: 1) its closed-form expression, 2) its dependence only on large-scale
statistics, and 3) its low training overhead. Notably, by exploiting the first two benefits, we
achieve to perform optimization with respect to the reflect beamforming matrix (RBM) that can take
place only at every several coherence intervals, and thus, reduces significantly the computational
cost compared to other methods which require frequent phase optimization. Among the insightful
observations, we highlight that uncorrelated Rayleigh fading does not allow optimization of the
SE, which makes the application of an IRS ineffective. Also, in the case that the phase drifts, describing
the distortion of the phases in the RBM, are uniformly distributed, the presence of an IRS provides
no advantage. The analytical results outperform previous works and are verified by Monte-Carlo
(MC) simulations.

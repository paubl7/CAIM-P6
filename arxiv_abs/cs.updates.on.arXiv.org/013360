Causality understanding between events is a critical natural language processing task that is
helpful in many areas, including health care, business risk management and finance. On close examination,
one can find a huge amount of textual content both in the form of formal documents or in content arising
from social media like Twitter, dedicated to communicating and exploring various types of causality
in the real world. Recognizing these "Cause-Effect" relationships between natural language events
continues to remain a challenge simply because it is often expressed implicitly. Implicit causality
is hard to detect through most of the techniques employed in literature and can also, at times be perceived
as ambiguous or vague. Also, although well-known datasets do exist for this problem, the examples
in them are limited in the range and complexity of the causal relationships they depict especially
when related to implicit relationships. Most of the contemporary methods are either based on lexico-semantic
pattern matching or are feature-driven supervised methods. Therefore, as expected these methods
are more geared towards handling explicit causal relationships leading to limited coverage for
implicit relationships and are hard to generalize. In this paper, we investigate the language model's
capabilities for causal association among events expressed in natural language text using sentence
context combined with event information, and by leveraging masked event context with in-domain
and out-of-domain data distribution. Our proposed methods achieve the state-of-art performance
in three different data distributions and can be leveraged for extraction of a causal diagram and/or
building a chain of events from unstructured text.

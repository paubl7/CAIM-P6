Real-world deployments of WiFi-based indoor localization in large public venues are few and far
between as most state-of-the-art solutions require either client or infrastructure-side changes.
Hence, even though high location accuracy is possible with these solutions, they are not practical
due to cost and/or client adoption reasons. Majority of the public venues use commercial controller-managed
WLAN solutions, %provided by Aruba, Cisco, etc., that neither allow client changes nor infrastructure
changes. In fact, for such venues we have observed highly heterogeneous devices with very low adoption
rates for client-side apps. In this paper, we present our experiences in deploying a scalable location
system for such venues. We show that server-side localization is not trivial and present two unique
challenges associated with this approach, namely \emph{Cardinality Mismatch} and \emph{High
Client Scan Latency}. The "Mismatch" challenge results in a significant mismatch between the set
of access points (APs) reporting a client in the offline and online phases, while the "Latency" challenge
results in a low number of APs reporting data for any particular client. We collect three weeks of
detailed ground truth data ($\approx 200$ landmarks), from a WiFi setup that has been deployed for
more than four years, to provide evidences for the extent and understanding the impact of these problems.
Our analysis of real-world client devices reveal that the current trend for the clients is to reduce
scans, thereby adversely impacting their localization accuracy. We analyze how localization
is impacted when scans are minimal. We propose heuristics to alleviate reduction in the accuracy
despite lesser scans. Besides the number of scans, we summarize the other challenges and pitfalls
of real deployments which hamper the localization accuracy.

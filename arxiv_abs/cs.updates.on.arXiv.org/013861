Feature descriptor of the point cloud is used in many applications such as registration and part
segmentation from 3D point clouds. Discriminative representations of the local geometric features
is unquestionably the most important task for accurate point cloud analyses. However, it is challenging
to develop rotation or scale invariant descriptors. Most of the previous works have either ignored
rotations or empirically studied optimal scale parameters, which hinder the applicability of
the methods for real-world datasets. In this paper, we present a new local feature description method
that is robust to rotation, density, and scales. Moreover, to improve representations of the local
descriptors, we propose a global aggregation method. First, we place kernels aligned around each
point regarding the normal direction. To avoid the sign problem of the normal vector, we use symmetric
kernel point distribution regarding the tangent plane. From each kernel point, we first projected
the points from the spatial space to the feature space, which is robust to multiscale and rotation,
based on angles and distances. Subsequently, we perform graph convolutions by considering local
kernel point structures and long-ranged global context, obtained by a global aggregation method.
We experimented with our proposed descriptors on the benchmark datasets (i.e., ModelNet40 and
ShapeNetPart) to evaluate the performance of registration, classification, and part segmentation
on 3D point clouds. Our methods showed superior performances compared to the state-of-the-art
methods by reducing 70$\%$ of the rotation and translation errors in the registration task. Our
method also showed comparable performance in the classification and part segmentation tasks without
any external data augmentations.

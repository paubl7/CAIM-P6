With today's technological advancements, mobile phones and wearable devices have become extensions
of an increasingly diffused and smart digital infrastructure. In this paper, we examine mobile
health (mHealth) platforms and their health and economic impacts on the outcomes of chronic disease
patients. To do so, we partnered with a major mHealth firm that provides one of the largest mobile
health app platforms in Asia specializing in diabetes care. We designed and implemented a randomized
field experiment based on detailed patient health activities (e.g., steps, exercises, sleep,
food intake) and blood glucose values from 1,070 diabetes patients over several months. Our main
findings show that the adoption of the mHealth app leads to an improvement in both short term metrics
(such as reduction in patients' blood glucose and glycated hemoglobin levels) and longer-term
metrics (such as hospital visits, and medical expenses). Patients who adopted the mHealth app undertook
higher levels of exercise, consumed healthier food with lower calories, walked more steps and slept
for longer times on a daily basis. A comparison of mobile vs. PC enabled version of the same app demonstrates
that the mobile has a stronger effect than PCs in helping patients make behavioral modifications
with respect to diet, exercise and life style, which ultimately leads to an improvement in their
healthcare outcomes. We also compared outcomes when the platform facilitates personalized health
reminders to patients vs. generic reminders. We found that personalized mobile message with patient-specific
guidance can have an inadvertent effect on patient app engagement, life style changes, and health
improvement. Overall, our findings indicate the potential value of mHealth technologies, as well
as the importance of mHealth platform design in achieving better healthcare outcomes.

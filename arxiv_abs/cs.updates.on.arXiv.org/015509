Recent years have witnessed a substantial increase in the deep learning (DL)architectures proposed
for visual recognition tasks like person re-identification,where individuals must be recognized
over multiple distributed cameras. Althoughthese architectures have greatly improved the state-of-the-art
accuracy, thecomputational complexity of the CNNs commonly used for feature extractionremains
an issue, hindering their deployment on platforms with limited resources,or in applications with
real-time constraints. There is an obvious advantage toaccelerating and compressing DL models
without significantly decreasing theiraccuracy. However, the source (pruning) domain differs
from operational (target)domains, and the domain shift between image data captured with differentnon-overlapping
camera viewpoints leads to lower recognition accuracy. In thispaper, we investigate the prunability
of these architectures under different designscenarios. This paper first revisits pruning techniques
that are suitable forreducing the computational complexity of deep CNN networks applied to personre-identification.
Then, these techniques are analysed according to their pruningcriteria and strategy, and according
to different scenarios for exploiting pruningmethods to fine-tuning networks to target domains.
Experimental resultsobtained using DL models with ResNet feature extractors, and multiplebenchmarks
re-identification datasets, indicate that pruning can considerablyreduce network complexity
while maintaining a high level of accuracy. Inscenarios where pruning is performed with large pre-training
or fine-tuningdatasets, the number of FLOPS required by ResNet architectures is reduced byhalf,
while maintaining a comparable rank-1 accuracy (within 1% of the originalmodel). Pruning while
training a larger CNNs can also provide a significantlybetter performance than fine-tuning smaller
ones.

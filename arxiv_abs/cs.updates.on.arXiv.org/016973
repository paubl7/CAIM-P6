This paper investigates the problem of providing ultra-reliable and energy-efficient virtual
reality (VR) experiences for wireless mobile users. To ensure reliable ultra-high-definition
(UHD) video frame delivery to mobile users and enhance their immersive visual experiences, a coordinated
multipoint (CoMP) transmission technique and millimeter wave (mmWave) communications are exploited.
Owing to user movement and time-varying wireless channels, the wireless VR experience enhancement
problem is formulated as a sequence-dependent and mixed-integer problem with a goal of maximizing
users' feeling of presence (FoP) in the virtual world, subject to power consumption constraints
on access points (APs) and users' head-mounted displays (HMDs). The problem, however, is hard to
be directly solved due to the lack of users' accurate tracking information and the sequence-dependent
and mixed-integer characteristics. To overcome this challenge, we develop a parallel echo state
network (ESN) learning method to predict users' tracking information by training fresh and historical
tracking samples separately collected by APs. With the learnt results, we propose a deep reinforcement
learning (DRL) based optimization algorithm to solve the formulated problem. In this algorithm,
we implement deep neural networks (DNNs) as a scalable solution to produce integer decision variables
and solving a continuous power control problem to criticize the integer decision variables. Finally,
the performance of the proposed algorithm is compared with various benchmark algorithms, and the
impact of different design parameters is also discussed. Simulation results demonstrate that
the proposed algorithm is more 4.14% energy-efficient than the benchmark algorithms.

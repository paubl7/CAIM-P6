In a 2006 paper, Jan Lorenz observed a curious behaviour in numerical simulations of the Hegselmann-Krause
model: Under some circumstances, making agents more closed-minded can produce a consensus from
a dense configuration of opinions which otherwise leads to fragmentation. Suppose one considers
initial opinions equally spaced on an interval of length $L$. As first observed by Lorenz, simulations
suggest that there are three intervals $[0, L_1)$, $(L_1, L_2)$ and $(L_2, L_3)$, with $L_1 \approx
5.23$, $L_2 \approx 5.67$ and $L_3 \approx 6.84$ such that, when the number of agents is sufficiently
large, consensus occurs in the first and third intervals, whereas for the second interval the system
fragments into three clusters. In this paper, we prove consensus for $L \leq 5.2$ and for $L$ sufficiently
close to 6. These proofs include large computations and in principle the set of $L$ for which consensus
can be proven using our approach may be extended with the use of more computing power. We also prove
that the set of $L$ for which consensus occurs is open. Moreover, we prove that, when consensus is
assured for the equally spaced systems, this in turn implies asymptotic almost sure consensus for
the same values of $L$ when initial opinions are drawn independently and uniformly at random. We
thus conjecture a pair of phase transitions, making precise the formulation of Lorenz's "consensus
strikes back" hypothesis. Our approach makes use of the continuous agent model introduced by Blondel,
Hendrickx and Tsitsiklis. Indeed, one contribution of the paper is to provide a presentation of
the relationships between the three different models with equally spaced, uniformly random and
continuous agents, respectively, which is more rigorous than what can be found in the existing literature.

There is a lack of scientific testing of commercially available malware detectors, especially
those that boast accurate classification of never-before-seen (zero-day) files using machine
learning (ML). The result is that the efficacy and trade-offs among the different available approaches
are opaque. In this paper, we address this gap in the scientific literature with an evaluation of
commercially available malware detection tools. We tested each tool against 3,536 total files
(2,554 72% malicious, 982 28% benign) including over 400 zero-day malware, and tested with a variety
of file types and protocols for delivery. Specifically, we investigate three questions: Do ML-based
malware detectors provide better detection than signature-based detectors? Is it worth purchasing
a network-level malware detector to complement host-based detection? What is the trade-off in
detection time and detection accuracy among commercially available tools using static and dynamic
analysis? We present statistical results on detection time and accuracy, consider complementary
analysis (using multiple tools together), and provide a novel application of a recent cost-benefit
evaluation procedure by Iannaconne \& Bridges that incorporates all the above metrics into a single
quantifiable cost to help security operation centers select the right tools for their use case.
Our results show that while ML-based tools are more effective at detecting zero-days and malicious
executables, they work best when used in combination with a signature-based solution. In addition,
network-based tools had poor detection rates on protocols other than the HTTP or SMTP, making them
a poor choice if used on their own. Surprisingly, we also found that all the tools tested had lower
than expected detection rates, completely missing 37% of malicious files tested and failing to
detect any polyglot files.

As neural networks gain widespread adoption in embedded devices, there is a need for model compression
techniques to facilitate deployment in resource-constrained environments. Quantization is
one of the go-to methods yielding state-of-the-art model compression. Most approaches take a fully
trained model, apply different heuristics to determine the optimal bit-precision for different
layers of the network, and retrain the network to regain any drop in accuracy. Based on Activation
Density (AD)-the proportion of non-zero activations in a layer-we propose an in-training quantization
method. Our method calculates bit-width for each layer during training yielding a mixed precision
model with competitive accuracy. Since we train lower precision models during training, our approach
yields the final quantized model at lower training complexity and also eliminates the need for re-training.
We run experiments on benchmark datasets like CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, TinyImagenet on VGG19/ResNet18
architectures and report the accuracy and energy estimates for the same. We achieve ~4.5x benefit
in terms of estimated multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) reduction while reducing the training complexity
by 50% in our experiments. To further evaluate the energy benefits of our proposed method, we develop
a mixed-precision scalable Process In Memory (PIM) hardware accelerator platform. The hardware
platform incorporates shift-add functionality for handling multi-bit precision neural network
models. Evaluating the quantized models obtained with our proposed method on the PIM platform yields
~5x energy reduction compared to 16-bit models. Additionally, we find that integrating AD based
quantization with AD based pruning (both conducted during training) yields up to ~198x and ~44x
energy reductions for VGG19 and ResNet18 architectures respectively on PIM platform compared
to baseline 16-bit precision, unpruned models.

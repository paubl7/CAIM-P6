The dynamically defined measure (DDM) $\Phi$ arising from a finite measure $\phi_0$ on an initial
$\sigma$-algebra on a set and an invertible map acting on the latter is considered. Several lower
bounds for it are obtained and sufficient conditions for its positivity are deduced under the general
assumption that there exists an invariant measure $\Lambda$ such that $\Lambda\ll\phi_0$. In
particular, DDMs arising from the Hellinger integral $\mathcal{J}_\alpha(\Lambda,\phi_0)\geq\mathcal{H}^{\alpha,0}(\Lambda,\phi_0)\geq\mathcal{H}_\alpha(\Lambda,\phi_0)$
are constructed with $\mathcal{H}_{0}\left(\Lambda,\phi_0\right)(Q) = \Phi(Q)$, $\mathcal{H}_{1}\left(\Lambda,\phi_0\right)(Q)
= \Lambda(Q)$, and \[\Phi(Q)^{1-\alpha}\Lambda(Q)^{\alpha}\geq\mathcal{J}_{\alpha}\left(\Lambda,\phi_0\right)(Q)\]
for all measurable $Q$ and $\alpha\in[0,1]$, and further computable lower bounds for them are obtained
and analyzed. The function $(0,\gamma]\owns\alpha\longmapsto\mathcal{H}_{\alpha}(\Lambda,\phi_0)$
is computed explicitly for $\gamma\geq 1$ such that $\int(d\Lambda/d\phi_0)^{\gamma-1}d\Lambda<\infty$
in the case of a discrete ergodic decomposition of $\Lambda$, and the other two functions are computed
under the additional condition of the equivalence of $\phi_0$ and $\Lambda$. In particular, if
$\Lambda$ is ergodic, it is shown that the first function is completely determined by the $\Lambda$-essential
supremum (infimum) of $d\Lambda/d\phi_0$ for all $0<\alpha<1$ ($1<\alpha\leq\gamma$), and,
if it is continuous at $0$, the above inequalities become equalities. The computation of it enables
an explicit computation of some DDMs arising as outer measure approximations with respect to it,
which demonstrates that this technique allows to obtain new measures, and that such measures can
have phase transitions with respect to the DDM specifying the covering sets.

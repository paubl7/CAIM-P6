This thesis presents algorithms for the feedback-stabilised walking of bipedal humanoid robotic
platforms, along with the underlying theoretical and sensorimotor frameworks required to achieve
it. Bipedal walking is inherently complex and difficult to control due to the high level of nonlinearity
and significant number of degrees of freedom of the concerned robots, the limited observability
and controllability of the corresponding states, and the combination of imperfect actuation with
less-than-ideal sensing. The presented methods deal with these issues in a multitude of ways, ranging
from the development of an actuator control and feed-forward compensation scheme, to the inclusion
of filtering in almost all of the gait stabilisation feedback pipelines. Two gaits are developed
and investigated, the direct fused angle feedback gait, and the tilt phase controller. Both gaits
follow the design philosophy of leveraging a semi-stable open-loop gait generator, and extending
it through stabilising feedback via the means of so-called corrective actions. The idea of using
corrective actions is to modify the generation of the open-loop joint waveforms in such a way that
the balance of the robot is influenced and thereby ameliorated. Examples of such corrective actions
include modifications of the arm swing and leg swing trajectories, the application of dynamic positional
and rotational offsets to the hips and feet, and adjustments of the commanded step size and timing.
Underpinning both feedback gaits and their corresponding gait generators are significant advances
in the field of 3D rotation theory. These advances include the development of three novel rotation
representations, the tilt angles, fused angles, and tilt phase space representations. All three
of these representations are founded on a new innovative way of splitting 3D rotations into their
respective yaw and tilt components.

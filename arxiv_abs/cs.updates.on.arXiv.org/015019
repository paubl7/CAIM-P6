Digital twins are meant to bridge the gap between real-world physical systems and virtual representations.
Both stand-alone and descriptive digital twins incorporate 3D geometric models, which are the
physical representations of objects in the digital replica. Digital twin applications are required
to rapidly update internal parameters with the evolution of their physical counterpart. Due to
an essential need for having high-quality geometric models for accurate physical representations,
the storage and bandwidth requirements for storing 3D model information can quickly exceed the
available storage and bandwidth capacity. In this work, we demonstrate a novel approach to geometric
change detection in the context of a digital twin. We address the issue through a combined solution
of Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) for motion detection, YOLOv5 for object detection, and 3D machine
learning for pose estimation. DMD is applied for background subtraction, enabling detection of
moving foreground objects in real-time. The video frames containing detected motion are extracted
and used as input to the change detection network. The object detection algorithm YOLOv5 is applied
to extract the bounding boxes of detected objects in the video frames. Furthermore, the rotational
pose of each object is estimated in a 3D pose estimation network. A series of convolutional neural
networks conducts feature extraction from images and 3D model shapes. Then, the network outputs
the estimated Euler angles of the camera orientation with respect to the object in the input image.
By only storing data associated with a detected change in pose, we minimize necessary storage and
bandwidth requirements while still being able to recreate the 3D scene on demand.

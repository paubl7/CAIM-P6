The novel Coronavirus disease, COVID-19, has rapidly and abruptly changed the world as we knew in
2020. It becomes the most unprecedent challenge to analytic epidemiology in general and signal
processing theories in specific. Given its high contingency nature and adverse effects across
the world, it is important to develop efficient processing/learning models to overcome this pandemic
and be prepared for potential future ones. In this regard, medical imaging plays an important role
for the management of COVID-19. Human-centered interpretation of medical images is, however,
tedious and can be subjective. This has resulted in a surge of interest to develop Radiomics models
for analysis and interpretation of medical images. Signal Processing (SP) and Deep Learning (DL)
models can assist in development of robust Radiomics solutions for diagnosis/prognosis, severity
assessment, treatment response, and monitoring of COVID-19 patients. In this article, we aim to
present an overview of the current state, challenges, and opportunities of developing SP/DL-empowered
models for diagnosis (screening/monitoring) and prognosis (outcome prediction and severity
assessment) of COVID-19 infection. More specifically, the article starts by elaborating the latest
development on the theoretical framework of analytic epidemiology and hypersignal processing
for COVID-19. Afterwards, imaging modalities and Radiological characteristics of COVID-19 are
discussed. SL/DL-based Radiomic models specific to the analysis of COVID-19 infection are then
described covering the following four domains: Segmentation of COVID-19 lesions; Predictive
models for outcome prediction; Severity assessment, and; Diagnosis/classification models.
Finally, open problems and opportunities are presented in detail.

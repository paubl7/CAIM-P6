The Bangla language is the seventh most spoken language, with 265 million native and non-native
speakers worldwide. However, English is the predominant language for online resources and technical
knowledge, journals, and documentation. Consequently, many Bangla-speaking people, who have
limited command of English, face hurdles to utilize English resources. To bridge the gap between
limited support and increasing demand, researchers conducted many experiments and developed
valuable tools and techniques to create and process Bangla language materials. Many efforts are
also ongoing to make it easy to use the Bangla language in the online and technical domains. There
are some review papers to understand the past, previous, and future Bangla Natural Language Processing
(BNLP) trends. The studies are mainly concentrated on the specific domains of BNLP, such as sentiment
analysis, speech recognition, optical character recognition, and text summarization. There
is an apparent scarcity of resources that contain a comprehensive study of the recent BNLP tools
and methods. Therefore, in this paper, we present a thorough review of 71 BNLP research papers and
categorize them into 11 categories, namely Information Extraction, Machine Translation, Named
Entity Recognition, Parsing, Parts of Speech Tagging, Question Answering System, Sentiment Analysis,
Spam and Fake Detection, Text Summarization, Word Sense Disambiguation, and Speech Processing
and Recognition. We study articles published between 1999 to 2021, and 50% of the papers were published
after 2015. We discuss Classical, Machine Learning and Deep Learning approaches with different
datasets while addressing the limitations and current and future trends of the BNLP.

Both the current trends in technology such as smartphones, general mobile devices, stationary
sensors, and satellites as well as a new user mentality of using this technology to voluntarily share
enriched location information produces a flood of geo-spatial and geo-spatiotemporal data. This
data flood provides tremendous potential for discovering new and useful knowledge. But in addition
to the fact that measurements are imprecise, spatial data is often interpolated between discrete
observations. To reduce communication and bandwidth utilization, data is often subjected to a
reduction, thereby eliminating some of the known/recorded values. These issues introduce the
notion of uncertainty in spatial data management, an aspect raising the imminent need for scalable
and flexible solutions. The main scope of this chapter is to survey existing techniques for managing,
querying, and mining uncertain spatial data. First, this chapter surveys common data representations
for uncertain data, explains the commonly used possible worlds semantics to interpret an uncertain
database, and surveys existing system to process uncertain data. Then, this chapter defines the
notion of probabilistic result semantics to distinguish the task of computing individual object
probabilities versus computing entire result probabilities. This is important, as, for many queries,
the problem of computing object-level probabilities can be solved efficiently, whereas result-level
probabilities are hard to compute. Finally, this chapter introduces a novel paradigm to efficiently
answer any kind of query on uncertain data: the Paradigm of Equivalent Worlds, which groups the exponential
set of possible database worlds into a polynomial number of sets of equivalent worlds that can be
processed efficiently. Examples and use-cases of querying uncertain spatial data are provided
using the example of uncertain range queries.

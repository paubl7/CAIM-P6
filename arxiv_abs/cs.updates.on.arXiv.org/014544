We study the problem of {\em impartial selection}, a topic that lies at the intersection of computational
social choice and mechanism design. The goal is to select the most popular individual among a set
of community members. The input can be modeled as a directed graph, where each node represents an
individual, and a directed edge indicates nomination or approval of a community member to another.
An {\em impartial mechanism} is robust to potential selfish behavior of the individuals and provides
appropriate incentives to voters to report their true preferences by ensuring that the chance of
a node to become a winner does not depend on its outgoing edges. The goal is to design impartial mechanisms
that select a node with an in-degree that is as close as possible to the highest in-degree. We measure
the efficiency of such a mechanism by the difference of these in-degrees, known as its {\em additive}
approximation. In particular, we study the extent to which prior information on voters' preferences
could be useful in the design of efficient deterministic impartial selection mechanisms with good
additive approximation guarantees. We consider three models of prior information, which we call
the {\em opinion poll}, the {\em a prior popularity}, and the {\em uniform} model. We analyze the
performance of a natural selection mechanism that we call {\em approval voting with default} (AVD)
and show that it achieves a $O(\sqrt{n\ln{n}})$ additive guarantee for opinion poll and a $O(\ln^2n)$
for a priori popularity inputs, where $n$ is the number of individuals. We consider this polylogarithmic
bound as our main technical contribution. We complement this last result by showing that our analysis
is close to tight, showing an $\Omega(\ln{n})$ lower bound. This holds in the uniform model, which
is the simplest among the three models.

The objective of this study is to predict the near-future flooding status of road segments based
on their own and adjacent road segments current status through the use of deep learning framework
on fine-grained traffic data. Predictive flood monitoring for situational awareness of road network
status plays a critical role to support crisis response activities such as evaluation of the loss
of access to hospitals and shelters. Existing studies related to near-future prediction of road
network flooding status at road segment level are missing. Using fine-grained traffic speed data
related to road sections, this study designed and implemented three spatio-temporal graph convolutional
network (STGCN) models to predict road network status during flood events at the road segment level
in the context of the 2017 Hurricane Harvey in Harris County (Texas, USA). Model 1 consists of two
spatio-temporal blocks considering the adjacency and distance between road segments, while Model
2 contains an additional elevation block to account for elevation difference between road segments.
Model 3 includes three blocks for considering the adjacency and the product of distance and elevation
difference between road segments. The analysis tested the STGCN models and evaluated their prediction
performance. Our results indicated that Model 1 and Model 2 have reliable and accurate performance
for predicting road network flooding status in near future (e.g., 2-4 hours) with model precision
and recall values larger than 98% and 96%, respectively. With reliable road network status predictions
in floods, the proposed model can benefit affected communities to avoid flooded roads and the emergency
management agencies to implement evacuation and relief resource delivery plans.

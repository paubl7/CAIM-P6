This work presents a non-intrusive surrogate modeling scheme based on machine learning technology
for predictive modeling of complex systems, described by parametrized time-dependent PDEs. For
these problems, typical finite element approaches involve the spatiotemporal discretization
of the PDE and the solution of the corresponding linear system of equations at each time step. Instead,
the proposed method utilizes a convolutional autoencoder in conjunction with a feed forward neural
network to establish a low-cost and accurate mapping from the problem's parametric space to its
solution space. For this purpose, time history response data are collected by solving the high-fidelity
model via FEM for a reduced set of parameter values. Then, by applying the convolutional autoencoder
to this data set, a low-dimensional representation of the high-dimensional solution matrices
is provided by the encoder, while the reconstruction map is obtained by the decoder. Using the latent
representation given by the encoder, a feed-forward neural network is efficiently trained to map
points from the problem's parametric space to the compressed version of the respective solution
matrices. This way, the encoded response of the system at new parameter values is given by the neural
network, while the entire response is delivered by the decoder. This approach effectively bypasses
the need to serially formulate and solve the system's governing equations at each time increment,
thus resulting in a significant cost reduction and rendering the method ideal for problems requiring
repeated model evaluations or 'real-time' computations. The elaborated methodology is demonstrated
on the stochastic analysis of time-dependent PDEs solved with the Monte Carlo method, however,
it can be straightforwardly applied to other similar-type problems, such as sensitivity analysis,
design optimization, etc.

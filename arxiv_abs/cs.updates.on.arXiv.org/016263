Light can undergo complex interactions with multiple scene surfaces of different material types
before being reflected towards a detector. During this transport, every surface reflection and
propagation is encoded in the properties of the photons that ultimately reach the detector, including
travel time, direction, intensity, wavelength and polarization. Conventional imaging systems
capture intensity by integrating over all other dimensions of the light into a single quantity,
hiding this rich scene information in the accumulated measurements. Existing methods can untangle
these into their spatial and temporal dimensions, fueling geometric scene understanding. However,
examining polarimetric material properties jointly with geometric properties is an open challenge
that could enable unprecedented capabilities beyond geometric understanding, allowing to incorporate
material-dependent semantics. In this work, we propose a computational light-transport imaging
method that captures the spatially- and temporally-resolved complete polarimetric response
of a scene. Our method hinges on a novel 7D tensor theory of light transport. We discover low-rank
structures in the polarimetric tensor dimension and propose a data-driven rotating ellipsometry
method that learns to exploit redundancy of the polarimetric structures. We instantiate our theory
in two imaging prototypes: spatio-polarimetric imaging and coaxial temporal-polarimetric imaging.
This allows us to decompose scene light transport into temporal, spatial, and complete polarimetric
dimensions that unveil scene properties hidden to conventional methods. We validate the applicability
of our method on diverse tasks, including shape reconstruction with subsurface scattering, seeing
through scattering medium, untangling multi-bounce light transport, breaking metamerism with
polarization, and spatio-polarimetric decomposition of crystals.

In systems involving quantitative data, such as probabilistic, fuzzy, or metric systems, behavioural
distances provide a more fine-grained comparison of states than two-valued notions of behavioural
equivalence or behaviour inclusion. Like in the two-valued case, the wide variation found in system
types creates a need for generic methods that apply to many system types at once. Approaches of this
kind are emerging within the paradigm of universal coalgebra, based either on lifting pseudometrics
along set functors or on lifting general real-valued (fuzzy) relations along functors by means
of fuzzy lax extensions. An immediate benefit of the latter is that they allow bounding behavioural
distance by means of fuzzy (bi-)simulations that need not themselves be hemi- or pseudometrics;
this is analogous to classical simulations and bisimulations, which need not be preorders or equivalence
relations, respectively. The known generic pseudometric liftings, specifically the generic
Kantorovich and Wasserstein liftings, both can be extended to yield fuzzy lax extensions, using
the fact that both are effectively given by a choice of quantitative modalities. Our central result
then shows that in fact all fuzzy lax extensions are Kantorovich extensions for a suitable set of
quantitative modalities, the so-called Moss modalities. For nonexpansive fuzzy lax extensions,
this allows for the extraction of quantitative modal logics that characterize behavioural distance,
i.e. satisfy a quantitative version of the Hennessy-Milner theorem; equivalently, we obtain expressiveness
of a quantitative version of Moss' coalgebraic logic. All our results explicitly hold also for asymmetric
distances (hemimetrics), i.e. notions of quantitative simulation.

Studying porous rock materials with X-Ray Computed Tomography (XRCT) has been established as a
standard procedure for the non-destructive visualization of flow and transport in opaque porous
media. Despite the recent advances in the field of XRCT, some challenges still remain due to the inherent
noise and imaging artefacts in the produced data. These issues become even more profound when the
objective is the identification of fractures, and/or fracture networks. The challenge is the limited
contrast between the regions of interest and the neighboring areas. This limited contrast can mostly
be attributed to the minute aperture of the fractures. In order to overcome this challenge, it has
been a common approach to apply digital image processing, such as filtering, to enhance the signal-to-noise
ratio. Additionally, segmentation methods based on threshold-/morphology schemes can be employed
to obtain enhanced information from the features of interest. However, this workflow needs a skillful
operator to fine-tune its input parameters, and the required computation time significantly increases
due to the complexity of the available methods, and the large volume of the data-set. In this study,
based on a data-set produced by the successful visualization of a fracture network in Carrara marble
with XRCT, we present the segmentation results from a number of segmentation methods. Three conventional
and two machine-learning-based methods are evaluated. The segmentation results from all five
methods are compared to each other in terms of segmentation quality and time efficiency. Due to memory
limitations, and in order to accomplish a fair comparison, all the methods are employed in a 2D scheme.
The output of the 2D U-net model, which is one of the adopted machine-learning-based segmentation
methods, shows the best performance regarding the quality of segmentation and the required processing
time.

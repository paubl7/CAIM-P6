Mutation testing is an effective approach to evaluate and strengthen software test suites, but
its adoption is currently limited by the mutants' execution computational cost. Several strategies
have been proposed to reduce this cost (a.k.a. mutation cost reduction strategies), however none
of them has proven to be effective for all scenarios since they often need an ad-hoc manual selection
and configuration depending on the software under test (SUT). In this paper, we propose a novel multi-objective
evolutionary hyper-heuristic approach, dubbed Sentinel, to automate the generation of optimal
cost reduction strategies for every new SUT. We evaluate Sentinel by carrying out a thorough empirical
study involving 40 releases of 10 open-source real-world software systems and both baseline and
state-of-the-art strategies as a benchmark. We execute a total of 4,800 experiments, and evaluate
their results with both quality indicators and statistical significance tests, following the
most recent best practice in the literature. The results show that strategies generated by Sentinel
outperform the baseline strategies in 95% of the cases always with large effect sizes. They also
obtain statistically significantly better results than state-of-the-art strategies in 88% of
the cases, with large effect sizes for 95% of them. Also, our study reveals that the mutation strategies
generated by Sentinel for a given software version can be used without any loss in quality for subsequently
developed versions in 95% of the cases. These results show that Sentinel is able to automatically
generate mutation strategies that reduce mutation testing cost without affecting its testing
effectiveness (i.e. mutation score), thus taking off from the tester's shoulders the burden of
manually selecting and configuring strategies for each SUT.

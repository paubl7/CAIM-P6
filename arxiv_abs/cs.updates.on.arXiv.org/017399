Salient object detection (SOD) is a long-standing research topic in computer vision and has drawn
an increasing amount of research interest in the past decade. This paper provides the first comprehensive
review and benchmark for light field SOD, which has long been lacking in the saliency community.
Firstly, we introduce preliminary knowledge on light fields, including theory and data forms,
and then review existing studies on light field SOD, covering ten traditional models, seven deep
learning-based models, one comparative study, and one brief review. Existing datasets for light
field SOD are also summarized with detailed information and statistical analyses. Secondly, we
benchmark nine representative light field SOD models together with several cutting-edge RGB-D
SOD models on four widely used light field datasets, from which insightful discussions and analyses,
including a comparison between light field SOD and RGB-D SOD models, are achieved. Besides, due
to the inconsistency of datasets in their current forms, we further generate complete data and supplement
focal stacks, depth maps and multi-view images for the inconsistent datasets, making them consistent
and unified. Our supplemental data makes a universal benchmark possible. Lastly, because light
field SOD is quite a special problem attributed to its diverse data representations and high dependency
on acquisition hardware, making it differ greatly from other saliency detection tasks, we provide
nine hints into the challenges and future directions, and outline several open issues. We hope our
review and benchmarking could help advance research in this field. All the materials including
collected models, datasets, benchmarking results, and supplemented light field datasets will
be publicly available on our project site https://github.com/kerenfu/LFSOD-Survey.

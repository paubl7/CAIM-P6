Social media provides the means by which extremist social movements, such as white supremacy and
anti LGBTQ, thrive online. Yet, we know little about the roles played by the participants of such
movements. In this paper, we investigate these participants to characterize their roles, their
role dynamics, and their influence in spreading online extremism. Our participants, online extremist
accounts, are 4,876 public Facebook pages or groups that have shared information from the websites
of 289 Southern Poverty Law Center designated extremist groups. By clustering the quantitative
features followed by qualitative expert validation, we identify five roles surrounding extremist
activism: educators, solicitors, flamers, motivators, sympathizers. For example, solicitors
use links from extremist websites to attract donations and participation in extremist issues,
whereas flamers share inflammatory extremist content inciting anger. We further investigate
role dynamics such as, how stable these roles are over time and how likely will extremist accounts
transition from one role into another. We find that roles core to the movement, educators and solicitors,
are more stable, while flamers and motivators can transition to sympathizers with high probability.
We further find that educators and solicitors exert the most influence in triggering extremist
link posts, whereas flamers are influential in triggering the spread of information from fake news
sources. Our results help in situating various roles on the trajectory of deeper engagement into
the extremist movements and understanding the potential effect of various counter extremism interventions.
Our findings have implications for understanding how online extremist movements flourish through
participatory activism and how they gain a spectrum of allies for mobilizing extremism online.

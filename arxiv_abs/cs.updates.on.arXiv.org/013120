The Karhunen-Lo\`eve series expansion (KLE) decomposes a stochastic process into an infinite
series of pairwise uncorrelated random variables and pairwise $L^2$-orthogonal functions. For
any given truncation order of the infinite series the basis is optimal in the sense that the total
mean squared error is minimized. The orthogonal basis functions are determined as the solution
of an eigenvalue problem corresponding to the homogeneous Fredholm integral equation of the second
kind, which is computationally challenging for several reasons. Firstly, a Galerkin discretization
requires numerical integration over a $2d$ dimensional domain, where $d$, in this work, denotes
the spatial dimension. Secondly, the main system matrix of the discretized weak-form is dense.
Consequently, the computational complexity of classical finite element formation and assembly
procedures as well as the memory requirements of direct solution techniques become quickly computationally
intractable with increasing polynomial degree, number of elements and degrees of freedom. The
objective of this work is to significantly reduce several of the computational bottlenecks associated
with numerical solution of the KLE. We present a matrix-free solution strategy, which is embarrassingly
parallel and scales favorably with problem size and polynomial degree. Our approach is based on
(1) an interpolation based quadrature that minimizes the required number of quadrature points;
(2) an inexpensive reformulation of the generalized eigenvalue problem into a standard eigenvalue
problem; and (3) a matrix-free and parallel matrix-vector product for iterative eigenvalue solvers.
Two higher-order three-dimensional benchmarks illustrate exceptional computational performance
combined with high accuracy and robustness.

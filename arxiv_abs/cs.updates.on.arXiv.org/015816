Research has a long history of discussing what is superior in predicting certain outcomes: statistical
methods or the human brain. This debate has repeatedly been sparked off by the remarkable technological
advances in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), such as solving tasks like object and speech
recognition, achieving significant improvements in accuracy through deep-learning algorithms
(Goodfellow et al. 2016), or combining various methods of computational intelligence, such as
fuzzy logic, genetic algorithms, and case-based reasoning (Medsker 2012). One of the implicit
promises that underlie these advancements is that machines will 1 day be capable of performing complex
tasks or may even supersede humans in performing these tasks. This triggers new heated debates of
when machines will ultimately replace humans (McAfee and Brynjolfsson 2017). While previous research
has proved that AI performs well in some clearly defined tasks such as playing chess, playing Go or
identifying objects on images, it is doubted that the development of an artificial general intelligence
(AGI) which is able to solve multiple tasks at the same time can be achieved in the near future (e.g.,
Russell and Norvig 2016). Moreover, the use of AI to solve complex business problems in organizational
contexts occurs scarcely, and applications for AI that solve complex problems remain mainly in
laboratory settings instead of being implemented in practice. Since the road to AGI is still a long
one, we argue that the most likely paradigm for the division of labor between humans and machines
in the next decades is Hybrid Intelligence. This concept aims at using the complementary strengths
of human intelligence and AI, so that they can perform better than each of the two could separately
(e.g., Kamar 2016).

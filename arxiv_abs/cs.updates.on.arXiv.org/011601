Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication in the vehicular ad hoc network (VANET), an infrastructure-free
mechanism, has emerged as a crucial component in the advanced Intelligent Transport System (ITS)
for special information transmission and inter-vehicular communications. One of the main research
challenges in VANET is the design and implementation of network routing protocols which manage
to trigger V2X communication with the reliable end-to-end connectivity and efficient packet transmission.
The organically changing nature of road transport vehicles poses a significant threat to VANET
with respect to the accuracy and reliability of packet delivery. Therefore, a position-based routing
protocol tends to be the predominant method in VANET as they overcome rapid changes in vehicle movements
effectively. However, existing routing protocols have some limitations such as (i) inaccurate
in high dynamic network topology, (ii) defective link-state estimation (iii) poor movement prediction
in heterogeneous road layouts. In this paper, a target-driven and mobility prediction (TDMP) based
routing protocol is therefore developed for high-speed mobility and dynamic topology of vehicles,
fluctuant traffic flow and diverse road layouts in VANET. The primary idea in TDMP is that the destination
target of a driver is included in the mobility prediction to assist the implementation of the routing
protocol. Compared to existing geographic routing protocols which mainly greedily forward the
packet to the next-hop based on its current position and partial road layout, TDMP is developed to
enhance the packet transmission with the consideration of the estimation of inter-vehicles link
status, and the prediction of vehicle positions dynamically in fluctuant mobility and global road
layout.

Chest X-rays are the most commonly available and affordable radiological examination for screening
thoracic diseases. According to the domain knowledge of screening chest X-rays, the pathological
information usually lay on the lung and heart regions. However, it is costly to acquire region-level
annotation in practice, and model training mainly relies on image-level class labels in a weakly
supervised manner, which is highly challenging for computer-aided chest X-ray screening. To address
this issue, some methods have been proposed recently to identify local regions containing pathological
information, which is vital for thoracic disease classification. Inspired by this, we propose
a novel deep learning framework to explore discriminative information from lung and heart regions.
We design a feature extractor equipped with a multi-scale attention module to learn global attention
maps from global images. To exploit disease-specific cues effectively, we locate lung and heart
regions containing pathological information by a well-trained pixel-wise segmentation model
to generate binarization masks. By introducing element-wise logical AND operator on the learned
global attention maps and the binarization masks, we obtain local attention maps in which pixels
are $1$ for lung and heart region and $0$ for other regions. By zeroing features of non-lung and heart
regions in attention maps, we can effectively exploit their disease-specific cues in lung and heart
regions. Compared to existing methods fusing global and local features, we adopt feature weighting
to avoid weakening visual cues unique to lung and heart regions. Evaluated by the benchmark split
on the publicly available chest X-ray14 dataset, the comprehensive experiments show that our method
achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art methods.

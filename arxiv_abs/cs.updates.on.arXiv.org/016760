Coronary X-ray angiography is a crucial clinical procedure for the diagnosis and treatment of coronary
artery disease, which accounts for roughly 16% of global deaths every year. However, the images
acquired in these procedures have low resolution and poor contrast, making lesion detection and
assessment challenging. Accurate coronary artery segmentation not only helps mitigate these
problems, but also allows the extraction of relevant anatomical features for further analysis
by quantitative methods. Although automated segmentation of coronary arteries has been proposed
before, previous approaches have used non-optimal segmentation criteria, leading to less useful
results. Most methods either segment only the major vessel, discarding important information
from the remaining ones, or segment the whole coronary tree based mostly on contrast information,
producing a noisy output that includes vessels that are not relevant for diagnosis. We adopt a better-suited
clinical criterion and segment vessels according to their clinical relevance. Additionally,
we simultaneously perform catheter segmentation, which may be useful for diagnosis due to the scale
factor provided by the catheter's known diameter, and is a task that has not yet been performed with
good results. To derive the optimal approach, we conducted an extensive comparative study of encoder-decoder
architectures trained on a combination of focal loss and a variant of generalized dice loss. Based
on the EfficientNet and the UNet++ architectures, we propose a line of efficient and high-performance
segmentation models using a new decoder architecture, the EfficientUNet++, whose best-performing
version achieved average dice scores of 0.8904 and 0.7526 for the artery and catheter classes, respectively,
and an average generalized dice score of 0.9234.

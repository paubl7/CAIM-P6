Machine learning can precisely identify different cancer tumors at any stage by classifying cancerous
and healthy samples based on their genomic profile. We have developed novel methods of MLAC (Machine
Learning Against Cancer) achieving perfect results with perfect precision, sensitivity, and
specificity. We have used the whole genome sequencing data acquired by next-generation RNA sequencing
techniques in The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotype-Tissue Expression projects for cancerous and
healthy tissues respectively. Moreover, we have shown that unsupervised machine learning clustering
has great potential to be used for cancer diagnosis. Indeed, a creative way to work with data and general
algorithms has resulted in perfect classification i.e. all precision, sensitivity, and specificity
are equal to 1 for most of the different tumor types even with a modest amount of data, and the same method
works well on a series of cancers and results in great clustering of cancerous and healthy samples
too. Our system can be used in practice because once the classifier is trained, it can be used to classify
any new sample of new potential patients. One advantage of our work is that the aforementioned perfect
precision and recall are obtained on samples of all stages including very early stages of cancer;
therefore, it is a promising tool for diagnosis of cancers in early stages. Another advantage of
our novel model is that it works with normalized values of RNA sequencing data, hence people's private
sensitive medical data will remain hidden, protected, and safe. This type of analysis will be widespread
and economical in the future and people can even learn to receive their RNA sequencing data and do
their own preliminary cancer studies themselves which have the potential to help the healthcare
systems. It is a great step forward toward good health that is the main base of sustainable societies.

In facing with the explosive Internet traffic growth, optical transport networks based on WDM technologies
forming the core part of Internet infrastructure carrying multi-Tb/s has to be re-considered from
both designing, planning, operation and management perspectives to attain greater efficiency.
Thanks to the convergence of significant advances in optical transmission technologies, and photonic
switching, transparent (all-optical) architecture has come into practice, paving the way for
eliminating the over-utilization of costly optical-electrical-optical (O-E-O) interfaces
and hence, yielding remarkable savings of cost and energy consumption compared to opaque architecture.
Traditional designs for transparent optical networks based on single-objective optimization
model aiming at optimizing solely a single performance metric appears to be insufficient to capture
the nuances of practical designs while conventional multi-objective approach tends to reach (non-)
optimal solutions. Different from existing works, we present a new framework for multi-objective
WDM network designs capturing several goals on one hand and on the other hand, achieving optimal
solutions. Moreover, our proposal exploits the characteristics of each constituent objectives
to lay the foundation for setting up weight coefficient so that the order of optimization is guaranteed.
Equally important, our proposal is pragmatic in the sense that the complexity of the optimization
model remains the same as the single-objective model while the quality of solution has been greatly
improved. We have extensively tested realistic optical core networks topologies, that is, COST239
and NSFNET, with various network traffic conditions and it turns out that our design brings about
a saving of wavelength link usage up to roughly $28\%$ in the most favorable cases while $14\%$ is
expected for the least favorable cases.

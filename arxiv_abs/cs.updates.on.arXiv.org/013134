AIMS. This study compared the performance of deep learning extensions of survival analysis models
with traditional Cox proportional hazards (CPH) models for deriving cardiovascular disease (CVD)
risk prediction equations in national health administrative datasets. METHODS. Using individual
person linkage of multiple administrative datasets, we constructed a cohort of all New Zealand
residents aged 30-74 years who interacted with publicly funded health services during 2012, and
identified hospitalisations and deaths from CVD over five years of follow-up. After excluding
people with prior CVD or heart failure, sex-specific deep learning and CPH models were developed
to estimate the risk of fatal or non-fatal CVD events within five years. The proportion of explained
time-to-event occurrence, calibration, and discrimination were compared between models across
the whole study population and in specific risk groups. FINDINGS. First CVD events occurred in 61,927
of 2,164,872 people. Among diagnoses and procedures, the largest 'local' hazard ratios were associated
by the deep learning models with tobacco use in women (2.04, 95%CI: 1.99-2.10) and with chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease with acute lower respiratory infection in men (1.56, 95%CI: 1.50-1.62). Other
identified predictors (e.g. hypertension, chest pain, diabetes) aligned with current knowledge
about CVD risk predictors. The deep learning models significantly outperformed the CPH models
on the basis of proportion of explained time-to-event occurrence (Royston and Sauerbrei's R-squared:
0.468 vs. 0.425 in women and 0.383 vs. 0.348 in men), calibration, and discrimination (all p<0.0001).
INTERPRETATION. Deep learning extensions of survival analysis models can be applied to large health
administrative databases to derive interpretable CVD risk prediction equations that are more
accurate than traditional CPH models.

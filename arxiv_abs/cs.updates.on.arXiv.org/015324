It is well known that numerical simulations of high-speed reacting flows, in the framework of state-to-state
formulations, are the most detailed but also often prohibitively computationally expensive.
In this work, we start to investigate the possibilities offered by the use of machine learning methods
for state-to-state approaches to alleviate such burden. In this regard, several tasks have been
identified. Firstly, we assessed the potential of state-of-the-art data-driven regression models
based on machine learning to predict the relaxation source terms which appear in the right-hand
side of the state-to-state Euler system of equations for a one-dimensional reacting flow of a N$_2$/N
binary mixture behind a plane shock wave. It is found that, by appropriately choosing the regressor
and opportunely tuning its hyperparameters, it is possible to achieve accurate predictions compared
to the full-scale state-to-state simulation in significantly shorter times. Secondly, we investigated
different strategies to speed-up our in-house state-to-state solver by coupling it with the best-performing
pre-trained machine learning algorithm. The embedding of machine learning methods into ordinary
differential equations solvers may offer a speed-up of several orders of magnitude but some care
should be paid for how and where such coupling is realized. Performances are found to be strongly
dependent on the mutual nature of the interfaced codes. Finally, we aimed at inferring the full solution
of the state-to-state Euler system of equations by means of a deep neural network completely by-passing
the use of the state-to-state solver while relying only on data. Promising results suggest that
deep neural networks appear to be a viable technology also for these tasks.

Excessive loads near wounds produce pathological scarring and other complications. Presently,
stress cannot easily be measured by surgeons in the operating room. Instead, surgeons rely on intuition
and experience. Predictive computational tools are ideal candidates for surgery planning. Finite
element (FE) simulations have shown promise in predicting stress fields on large skin patches and
complex cases, helping to identify potential regions of complication. Unfortunately, these simulations
are computationally expensive and deterministic. However, running a few, well-selected FE simulations
allows us to create Gaussian process (GP) surrogate models of local cutaneous flaps that are computationally
efficient and able to predict stress and strain for arbitrary material parameters. Here, we create
GP surrogates for the advancement, rotation, and transposition flaps. We then use the predictive
capability of these surrogates to perform a global sensitivity analysis, ultimately showing that
fiber direction has the most significant impact on strain field variations. We then perform an optimization
to determine the optimal fiber direction for each flap for three different objectives driven by
clinical guidelines. While material properties are not controlled by the surgeon and are actually
a source of uncertainty, the surgeon can in fact control the orientation of the flap. Therefore,
fiber direction is the only material parameter that can be optimized clinically. The optimization
task relies on the efficiency of the GP surrogates to calculate the expected cost of different strategies
when the uncertainty of other material parameters is included. We propose optimal flap orientations
for the three cost functions and that can help in reducing stress resulting from the surgery and ultimately
reduce complications associated with excessive mechanical loading near wounds.

Concepts of Mobility-on-Demand (MOD) and Mobility as a Service (MaaS), which feature the integration
of various shared-use mobility options, have gained widespread popularity in recent years. While
these concepts promise great benefits to travelers, their heavy reliance on technology raises
equity concerns as socially disadvantaged population groups can be left out in an era of on-demand
mobility. This paper investigates the potential uptake of MOD transit services (integrated fixed-route
and on-demand services) among travelers living in low-income communities. Specially, we analyze
people's latent attitude towards three shared-use mobility services, including ride-hailing
services, fixed-route transit, and MOD transit. We conduct a latent class cluster analysis of 825
survey respondents sampled from low-income neighborhoods in Detroit and Ypsilanti, Michigan.
We identified three latent segments: shared-mode enthusiast, shared-mode opponent, and fixed-route
transit loyalist. People from the shared-mode enthusiast segment often use ride-hailing services
and live in areas with poor transit access, and they are likely to be the early adopters of MOD transit
services. The shared-mode opponent segment mainly includes vehicle owners who lack interests
in shared mobility options. The fixed-route transit loyalist segment includes a considerable
share of low-income individuals who face technological barriers to use the MOD transit. We also
find that males, college graduates, car owners, people with a mobile data plan, and people living
in poor-transit-access areas have a higher level of preferences for MOD transit services. We conclude
with policy recommendations for developing more accessible and equitable MOD transit services.

3D complete renal structures(CRS) segmentation targets on segmenting the kidneys, tumors, renal
arteries and veins in one inference. Once successful, it will provide preoperative plans and intraoperative
guidance for laparoscopic partial nephrectomy(LPN), playing a key role in the renal cancer treatment.
However, no success has been reported in 3D CRS segmentation due to the complex shapes of renal structures,
low contrast and large anatomical variation. In this study, we utilize the adversarial ensemble
learning and propose Ensemble Multi-condition GAN(EnMcGAN) for 3D CRS segmentation for the first
time. Its contribution is three-fold. 1)Inspired by windowing, we propose the multi-windowing
committee which divides CTA image into multiple narrow windows with different window centers and
widths enhancing the contrast for salient boundaries and soft tissues. And then, it builds an ensemble
segmentation model on these narrow windows to fuse the segmentation superiorities and improve
whole segmentation quality. 2)We propose the multi-condition GAN which equips the segmentation
model with multiple discriminators to encourage the segmented structures meeting their real shape
conditions, thus improving the shape feature extraction ability. 3)We propose the adversarial
weighted ensemble module which uses the trained discriminators to evaluate the quality of segmented
structures, and normalizes these evaluation scores for the ensemble weights directed at the input
image, thus enhancing the ensemble results. 122 patients are enrolled in this study and the mean
Dice coefficient of the renal structures achieves 84.6%. Extensive experiments with promising
results on renal structures reveal powerful segmentation accuracy and great clinical significance
in renal cancer treatment.

Recent progress in pre-trained neural language models has significantly improved the performance
of many natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper we propose a new model architecture
DeBERTa (Decoding-enhanced BERT with disentangled attention) that improves the BERT and RoBERTa
models using two novel techniques. The first is the disentangled attention mechanism, where each
word is represented using two vectors that encode its content and position, respectively, and the
attention weights among words are computed using disentangled matrices on their contents and relative
positions, respectively. Second, an enhanced mask decoder is used to incorporate absolute positions
in the decoding layer to predict the masked tokens in model pre-training. In addition, a new virtual
adversarial training method is used for fine-tuning to improve models' generalization. We show
that these techniques significantly improve the efficiency of model pre-training and the performance
of both natural language understanding (NLU) and natural langauge generation (NLG) downstream
tasks. Compared to RoBERTa-Large, a DeBERTa model trained on half of the training data performs
consistently better on a wide range of NLP tasks, achieving improvements on MNLI by +0.9% (90.2%
vs. 91.1%), on SQuAD v2.0 by +2.3% (88.4% vs. 90.7%) and RACE by +3.6% (83.2% vs. 86.8%). Notably,
we scale up DeBERTa by training a larger version that consists of 48 Transform layers with 1.5 billion
parameters. The significant performance boost makes the single DeBERTa model surpass the human
performance on the SuperGLUE benchmark (Wang et al., 2019a) for the first time in terms of macro-average
score (89.9 versus 89.8), and the ensemble DeBERTa model sits atop the SuperGLUE leaderboard as
of January 6, 2021, out performing the human baseline by a decent margin (90.3 versus 89.8).

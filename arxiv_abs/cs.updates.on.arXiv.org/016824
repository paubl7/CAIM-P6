Transient stability has been extensively studied in the framework of Lyapunov stability. Theorists
are interested in the convergence of all states to certain post-disturbance equilibrium, while
practitioners often assess transient stability solely based on convergence to nominal frequencies
and steady-state voltages, which we refer to as augmented synchronization. Despite substantial
results, conventional transient stability theories suffer from the stringent requirement of
prior knowledge of the post-disturbance equilibrium. On the other hand, the wisdom from practice
seems to provide an equilibrium-independent approach, although one intriguing and worrying question
remains: does the convergence of frequencies and voltages always imply convergence of all states?
This paper aims to bridge such a theory-practice gap by pursuing two objectives. First, we derive
checkable conditions under which converging to augmented synchronization implies convergence
of all states to the equilibrium set, and hence lay a theoretical foundation for the empirical wisdom.
Second, we establish several theorems that answer under what conditions the power system can converge
to augmented synchronization. These two results enable a new equilibrium-independent analytic
for transient stability, which essentially re-defines the nominal motion of power systems as augmented
synchronization rather than certain equilibrium. This new methodology is promising especially
when the post-disturbance equilibrium is unknown or non-isolated equilibria exit, in which cases
the conventional methods cannot apply. Rudimentary single-machine examples and the IEEE 9-bus
benchmark system well verify our results and illustrate interesting implications.

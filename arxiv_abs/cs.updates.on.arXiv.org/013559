We study the interplay of fairness, welfare, and equity considerations in personalized pricing
based on customer features. Sellers are increasingly able to conduct price personalization based
on predictive modeling of demand conditional on covariates: setting customized interest rates,
targeted discounts of consumer goods, and personalized subsidies of scarce resources with positive
externalities like vaccines and bed nets. These different application areas may lead to different
concerns around fairness, welfare, and equity on different objectives: price burdens on consumers,
price envy, firm revenue, access to a good, equal access, and distributional consequences when
the good in question further impacts downstream outcomes of interest. We conduct a comprehensive
literature review in order to disentangle these different normative considerations and propose
a taxonomy of different objectives with mathematical definitions. We focus on observational metrics
that do not assume access to an underlying valuation distribution which is either unobserved due
to binary feedback or ill-defined due to overriding behavioral concerns regarding interpreting
revealed preferences. In the setting of personalized pricing for the provision of goods with positive
benefits, we discuss how price optimization may provide unambiguous benefit by achieving a "triple
bottom line": personalized pricing enables expanding access, which in turn may lead to gains in
welfare due to heterogeneous utility, and improve revenue or budget utilization. We empirically
demonstrate the potential benefits of personalized pricing in two settings: pricing subsidies
for an elective vaccine, and the effects of personalized interest rates on downstream outcomes
in microcredit.

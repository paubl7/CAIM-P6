This paper investigates adaptive streaming of one or multiple tiled 360 videos from a multi-antenna
base station (BS) to one or multiple single-antenna users, respectively, in a multi-carrier wireless
system. We aim to maximize the video quality while keeping rebuffering time small via encoding rate
adaptation at each group of pictures (GOP) and transmission adaptation at each (transmission)
slot. To capture the impact of field-of-view (FoV) prediction, we consider three cases of FoV viewing
probability distributions, i.e., perfect, imperfect, and unknown FoV viewing probability distributions,
and use the average total utility, worst average total utility, and worst total utility as the respective
performance metrics. In the single-user scenario, we optimize the encoding rates of the tiles,
encoding rates of the FoVs, and transmission beamforming vectors for all subcarriers to maximize
the total utility in each case. In the multi-user scenario, we adopt rate splitting with successive
decoding and optimize the encoding rates of the tiles, encoding rates of the FoVs, rates of the common
and private messages, and transmission beamforming vectors for all subcarriers to maximize the
total utility in each case. Then, we separate the challenging optimization problem into multiple
tractable problems in each scenario. In the single-user scenario, we obtain a globally optimal
solution of each problem using transformation techniques and the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions.
In the multi-user scenario, we obtain a KKT point of each problem using the concave-convex procedure
(CCCP). Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed solutions achieve notable gains
over existing schemes in all three cases. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work revealing
the impact of FoV prediction on the performance of adaptive streaming of tiled 360 videos.

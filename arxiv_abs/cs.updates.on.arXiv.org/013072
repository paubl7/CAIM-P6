Since many safety-critical systems, such as surgical robots and autonomous driving cars, are in
unstable environments with sensor noise and incomplete data, it is desirable for object detectors
to take into account the confidence of localization prediction. There are three limitations of
the prior uncertainty estimation methods for anchor-based object detection. 1) They model the
uncertainty based on object properties having different characteristics, such as location (center
point) and scale (width, height). 2) they model a box offset and ground-truth as Gaussian distribution
and Dirac delta distribution, which leads to the model misspecification problem. Because the Dirac
delta distribution is not exactly represented as Gaussian, i.e., for any $\mu$ and $\Sigma$. 3)
Since anchor-based methods are sensitive to hyper-parameters of anchor, the localization uncertainty
modeling is also sensitive to these parameters. Therefore, we propose a new localization uncertainty
estimation method called Gaussian-FCOS for anchor-free object detection. Our method captures
the uncertainty based on four directions of box offsets~(left, right, top, bottom) that have similar
properties, which enables to capture which direction is uncertain and provide a quantitative value
in range~[0, 1]. To this end, we design a new uncertainty loss, negative power log-likelihood loss,
to measure uncertainty by weighting IoU to the likelihood loss, which alleviates the model misspecification
problem. Experiments on COCO datasets demonstrate that our Gaussian-FCOS reduces false positives
and finds more missing-objects by mitigating over-confidence scores with the estimated uncertainty.
We hope Gaussian-FCOS serves as a crucial component for the reliability-required task.

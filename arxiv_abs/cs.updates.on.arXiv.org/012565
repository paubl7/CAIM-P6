The advancements in connected and autonomous vehicles in these times demand the availability of
tools providing the agents with the capability to be aware and predict their own states and context
dynamics. This article presents a novel approach to develop an initial level of collective awareness
in a network of intelligent agents. A specific collective self awareness functionality is considered,
namely, agent centered detection of abnormal situations present in the environment around any
agent in the network. Moreover, the agent should be capable of analyzing how such abnormalities
can influence the future actions of each agent. Data driven dynamic Bayesian network (DBN) models
learned from time series of sensory data recorded during the realization of tasks (agent network
experiences) are here used for abnormality detection and prediction. A set of DBNs, each related
to an agent, is used to allow the agents in the network to each synchronously aware possible abnormalities
occurring when available models are used on a new instance of the task for which DBNs have been learned.
A growing neural gas (GNG) algorithm is used to learn the node variables and conditional probabilities
linking nodes in the DBN models; a Markov jump particle filter (MJPF) is employed for state estimation
and abnormality detection in each agent using learned DBNs as filter parameters. Performance metrics
are discussed to asses the algorithms reliability and accuracy. The impact is also evaluated by
the communication channel used by the network to share the data sensed in a distributed way by each
agent of the network. The IEEE 802.11p protocol standard has been considered for communication
among agents. Real data sets are also used acquired by autonomous vehicles performing different
tasks in a controlled environment.

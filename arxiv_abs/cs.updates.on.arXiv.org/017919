With the underlying aim of increasing efficiency of computational modelling pertinent for managing
and protecting the Great Barrier Reef, we investigate the use of deep neural networks for opportunistic
model emulation of APSIM models by repurposing an existing large dataset containing the outputs
of APSIM model runs. The dataset has not been specifically tailored for the model emulation task.
We employ two neural network architectures for the emulation task: densely connected feed-forward
neural network (FFNN), and gated recurrent unit feeding into FFNN (GRU-FFNN), a type of a recurrent
neural network. Various configurations of the architectures are trialled. A minimum correlation
statistic is employed to identify clusters of APSIM scenarios that can be aggregated to form training
sets for model emulation. We focus on emulating four important outputs of the APSIM model: runoff,
soil_loss, DINrunoff, Nleached. The GRU-FFNN architecture with three hidden layers and 128 units
per layer provides good emulation of runoff and DINrunoff. However, soil_loss and Nleached were
emulated relatively poorly under a wide range of the considered architectures; the emulators failed
to capture variability at higher values of these two outputs. While the opportunistic data available
from past modelling activities provides a large and useful dataset for exploring APSIM emulation,
it may not be sufficiently rich enough for successful deep learning of more complex model dynamics.
Design of Computer Experiments may be required to generate more informative data to emulate all
output variables of interest. We also suggest the use of synthetic meteorology settings to allow
the model to be fed a wide range of inputs. These need not all be representative of normal conditions,
but can provide a denser, more informative dataset from which complex relationships between input
and outputs can be learned.

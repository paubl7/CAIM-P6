The 1st International Workshop on Adaptive Cyber Defense was held as part of the 2021 International
Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence. This workshop was organized to share research that
explores unique applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) as foundational
capabilities for the pursuit of adaptive cyber defense. The cyber domain cannot currently be reliably
and effectively defended without extensive reliance on human experts. Skilled cyber defenders
are in short supply and often cannot respond fast enough to cyber threats. Building on recent advances
in AI and ML the Cyber defense research community has been motivated to develop new dynamic and sustainable
defenses through the adoption of AI and ML techniques to both cyber and non-cyber settings. Bridging
critical gaps between AI and Cyber researchers and practitioners can accelerate efforts to create
semi-autonomous cyber defenses that can learn to recognize and respond to cyber attacks or discover
and mitigate weaknesses in cooperation with other cyber operation systems and human experts. Furthermore,
these defenses are expected to be adaptive and able to evolve over time to thwart changes in attacker
behavior, changes in the system health and readiness, and natural shifts in user behavior over time.
The Workshop (held on August 19th and 20th 2021 in Montreal-themed virtual reality) was comprised
of technical presentations and a panel discussion focused on open problems and potential research
solutions. Workshop submissions were peer reviewed by a panel of domain experts with a proceedings
consisting of 10 technical articles exploring challenging problems of critical importance to
national and global security. Participation in this workshop offered new opportunities to stimulate
research and innovation in the emerging domain of adaptive and autonomous cyber defense.

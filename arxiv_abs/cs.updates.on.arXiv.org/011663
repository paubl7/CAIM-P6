In the $(k,h)$-SetCover problem, we are given a collection $\mathcal{S}$ of sets over a universe
$U$, and the goal is to distinguish between the case that $\mathcal{S}$ contains $k$ sets which cover
$U$, from the case that at least $h$ sets in $\mathcal{S}$ are needed to cover $U$. Lin (ICALP'19)
recently showed a gap creating reduction from the $(k,k+1)$-SetCover problem on universe of size
$O_k(\log |\mathcal{S}|)$ to the $\left(k,\sqrt[k]{\frac{\log|\mathcal{S}|}{\log\log |\mathcal{S}|}}\cdot
k\right)$-SetCover problem on universe of size $|\mathcal{S}|$. In this paper, we prove a more
scalable version of his result: given any error correcting code $C$ over alphabet $[q]$, rate $\rho$,
and relative distance $\delta$, we use $C$ to create a reduction from the $(k,k+1)$-SetCover problem
on universe $U$ to the $\left(k,\sqrt[2k]{\frac{2}{1-\delta}}\right)$-SetCover problem on
universe of size $\frac{\log|\mathcal{S}|}{\rho}\cdot|U|^{q^k}$. Lin established his result
by composing the input SetCover instance (that has no gap) with a special threshold graph constructed
from extremal combinatorial object called universal sets, resulting in a final SetCover instance
with gap. Our reduction follows along the exact same lines, except that we generate the threshold
graphs specified by Lin simply using the basic properties of the error correcting code $C$. We use
the same threshold graphs mentioned above to prove inapproximability results, under W[1]$\neq$FPT
and ETH, for the $k$-MaxCover problem introduced by Chalermsook et al. (SICOMP'20). Our inapproximaiblity
results match the bounds obtained by Karthik et al. (JACM'19), although their proof framework is
very different, and involves generalization of the distributed PCP framework. Prior to this work,
it was not clear how to adopt the proof strategy of Lin to prove inapproximability results for $k$-MaxCover.

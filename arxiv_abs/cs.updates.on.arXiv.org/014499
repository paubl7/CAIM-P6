We study the problem of sampling an approximately uniformly random satisfying assignment for atomic
constraint satisfaction problems i.e. where each constraint is violated by only one assignment
to its variables. Let $p$ denote the maximum probability of violation of any constraint and let $\Delta$
denote the maximum degree of the line graph of the constraints. Our main result is a nearly-linear
(in the number of variables) time algorithm for this problem, which is valid in a Lov\'asz local lemma
type regime that is considerably less restrictive compared to previous works. In particular, we
provide sampling algorithms for the uniform distribution on: (1) $q$-colorings of $k$-uniform
hypergraphs with $\Delta \lesssim q^{(k-4)/3 + o_{q}(1)}.$ The exponent $1/3$ improves the previously
best-known $1/7$ in the case $q, \Delta = O(1)$ [Jain, Pham, Vuong; arXiv, 2020] and $1/9$ in the general
case [Feng, He, Yin; STOC 2021]. (2) Satisfying assignments of Boolean $k$-CNF formulas with $\Delta
\lesssim 2^{k/5.741}.$ The constant $5.741$ in the exponent improves the previously best-known
$7$ in the case $k = O(1)$ [Jain, Pham, Vuong; arXiv, 2020] and $13$ in the general case [Feng, He, Yin;
STOC 2021]. (3) Satisfying assignments of general atomic constraint satisfaction problems with
$p\cdot \Delta^{7.043} \lesssim 1.$ The constant $7.043$ improves upon the previously best-known
constant of $350$ [Feng, He, Yin; STOC 2021]. At the heart of our analysis is a novel information-percolation
type argument for showing the rapid mixing of the Glauber dynamics for a carefully constructed projection
of the uniform distribution on satisfying assignments. Notably, there is no natural partial order
on the space, and we believe that the techniques developed for the analysis may be of independent
interest.

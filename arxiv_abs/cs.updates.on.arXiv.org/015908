Warfarin, a commonly prescribed drug to prevent blood clots, has a highly variable individual response.
Determining a maintenance warfarin dose that achieves a therapeutic blood clotting time, as measured
by the international normalized ratio (INR), is crucial in preventing complications. Machine
learning algorithms are increasingly being used for warfarin dosing; usually, an initial dose
is predicted with clinical and genotype factors, and this dose is revised after a few days based on
previous doses and current INR. Since a sequence of prior doses and INR better capture the variability
in individual warfarin response, we hypothesized that longitudinal dose response data will improve
maintenance dose predictions. To test this hypothesis, we analyzed a dataset from the COAG warfarin
dosing study, which includes clinical data, warfarin doses and INR measurements over the study
period, and maintenance dose when therapeutic INR was achieved. Various machine learning regression
models to predict maintenance warfarin dose were trained with clinical factors and dosing history
and INR data as features. Overall, dose revision algorithms with a single dose and INR achieved comparable
performance as the baseline dose revision algorithm. In contrast, dose revision algorithms with
longitudinal dose and INR data provided maintenance dose predictions that were statistically
significantly much closer to the true maintenance dose. Focusing on the best performing model,
gradient boosting (GB), the proportion of ideal estimated dose, i.e., defined as within $\pm$20%
of the true dose, increased from the baseline (54.92%) to the GB model with the single (63.11%) and
longitudinal (75.41%) INR. More accurate maintenance dose predictions with longitudinal dose
response data can potentially achieve therapeutic INR faster, reduce drug-related complications
and improve patient outcomes with warfarin therapy.

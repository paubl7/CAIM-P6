The Affordable care Act of 2010 had introduced Readmission reduction program in 2012 to reduce avoidable
re-admissions to control rising healthcare costs. Wound care impacts 15 of medicare beneficiaries
making it one of the major contributors of medicare health care cost. Health plans have been exploring
proactive health care services that can focus on preventing wound recurrences and re-admissions
to control the wound care costs. With rising costs of Wound care industry, it has become of paramount
importance to reduce wound recurrences & patient re-admissions. What factors are responsible
for a Wound to recur which ultimately lead to hospitalization or re-admission? Is there a way to identify
the patients at risk of re-admission before the occurrence using data driven analysis? Patient
re-admission risk management has become critical for patients suffering from chronic wounds such
as diabetic ulcers, pressure ulcers, and vascular ulcers. Understanding the risk & the factors
that cause patient readmission can help care providers and patients avoid wound recurrences. Our
work focuses on identifying patients who are at high risk of re-admission & determining the time
period with in which a patient might get re-admitted. Frequent re-admissions add financial stress
to the patient & Health plan and deteriorate the quality of life of the patient. Having this information
can allow a provider to set up preventive measures that can delay, if not prevent, patients' re-admission.
On a combined wound & episode-level data set of patient's wound care information, our extended autoprognosis
achieves a recall of 92 and a precision of 92 for the predicting a patient's re-admission risk. For
new patient class, precision and recall are as high as 91 and 98, respectively. We are also able to
predict the patient's discharge event for a re-admission event to occur through our model with a
MAE of 2.3 weeks.

We study ten molecular transitions obtained from an unbiased 3 mm molecular line survey using the
IRAM 30 m telescope toward 409 compact dust clumps identified by the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey
of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL) to understand photodissociation regions (PDRs) associated with the clumps.
The main goal of this study is to investigate whether the abundances of the selected molecules show
any variations resulting from the PDR chemistry in different clump environments. We selected HCO,
HOC$^+$, C$_{2}$H, c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$, CN, H$^{13}$CN, HC$^{15}$N, and HN$^{13}$C as PDR tracers,
and H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and C$^{18}$O as dense gas tracers. We find that the abundances of HCO, CN,
C$_{2}$H and c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$ decrease as the H$_{2}$ column density increase, indicating high
visual extinction, while those of high density tracers (i.e., H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$ and HC$^{15}$N)
are constant. In addition, $N$(HCO)/$N$(H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$) ratios significantly decrease as
H$_{2}$ column density increase, and in particular, 82 clumps have $X$(HCO) $\gtrsim 10^{-10}$
and $N$(HCO)/$N$(H$^{13}$CO$^{+}$) $\gtrsim 1$, which are the indication of far-ultraviolet
(FUV) chemistry. This suggests the observed HCO abundances are likely associated with FUV radiation
illuminating the PDRs. We also find that high $N$(c-C$_{3}$H$_{2}$)/$N$(C$_{2}$H) ratios found
for HII regions having high HCO abundances ($\gtrsim\,10^{-10}$) are associated with more evolved
clumps with high $L_{\rm bol}$/$M_{\rm clump}$. This trend might be associated with gain-surface
processes, which determine initial abundances of these molecules, and time-dependent effects
in the clumps corresponding to the envelopes around dense PDRs and HII regions. In addition, some
fraction of the measured abundances of the small hydrocarbons of the HII sources can be the result
of the photodissociation of PAH molecules.

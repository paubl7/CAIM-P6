Abundances of beryllium in metal-poor stars scale linearly with metallicity down to [Fe/H] ~ -3.0.
In the stars where Be has been detected at this extremely metal-poor regime, an increased abundance
scatter has been previously reported. This scatter could indicate a flattening of the relation
between Be and [Fe/H]. Our aim is to perform a new investigation of Be abundances in extremely metal-poor
stars and try to clarify whether a Be abundance plateau exists. We revisited the Be abundances in
a sample of nine dwarfs with [Fe/H] ~ -3.0. Additionally, we analysed the Be lines in the spectra of
stars BPS BS 16968-0061 and CD-33 1173 for the first time. We took advantage of Gaia DR2 parallaxes
to refine values of the surface gravity of the stars. Abundances of Be were determined using spectrum
synthesis. Some of the stars indeed suggest a flattening. Between [Fe/H] ~ -2.70 and -3.26, the Be
abundances stay mostly constant at log(Be/H) ~ -13.2 dex. Nevertheless, for several stars we could
only place upper limits that are below that level. Most of the sample stars are consistent with having
been formed at the progenitor of the so-called Gaia-Enceladus merger. Two out of the three stars
likely formed in-situ are the ones that deviate the most from the linear relation. The mixed origin
of these stars offers a clue to understanding the flattening. We suggest that our observations can
be understood as a consequence of the inhomogeneous star forming conditions in the early Galaxy.
Without efficient mixing, the early ISM would be characterised by a large scatter in Fe abundances
at a given moment. Beryllium, on the other hand, because of its origins in cosmic-ray spallation,
would have more homogeneous abundances (in a Galaxy-wide sense). We therefore suggest that the
observed flattening of the Be-versus-Fe relation reflects a stronger scatter in the Galactic Fe
abundances at a given age [abridged].

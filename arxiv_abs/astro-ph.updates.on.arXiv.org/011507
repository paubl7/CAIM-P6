Most neutron stars are expected to be born in supernovae, but only about half of supernova remnants
(SNRs) are associated with a compact object. In many cases, a supernova progenitor may have resulted
in a black hole. However, there are several possible reasons why true pulsar-SNR associations may
have been missed in previous surveys: The pulsar's radio beam may not be oriented towards us; the
pulsar may be too faint to be detectable; or there may be an offset in the pulsar position caused by
a kick. Our goal is to find new pulsars in SNRs and explore their possible association with the remnant.
The search and selection of the remnants presented in this paper was inspired by the non-detection
of any X-ray bright compact objects in these remnants when previously studied. Five SNRs were searched
for radio pulsars with the Green Bank Telescope at 820 MHz with multiple pointings to cover the full
spatial extent of the remnants. A periodicity search plus an acceleration search up to 500 m/s^2
and a single pulse search were performed for each pointing in order to detect potential isolated
binary pulsars and single pulses, respectively. No new pulsars were detected in the survey. However,
we were able to re-detect a known pulsar, PSR J2047+5029, near SNR G89.0+4.7. We were unable to detect
the radio-quiet gamma-ray pulsar PSR J2021+4026, but we do find a flux density limit of 0.08 mJy.
Our flux density limits make our survey two to 16 times more sensitive than previous surveys, while
also covering the whole spatial extent of the same remnants. We discuss potential explanations
for the non-detection of a pulsar in the studied SNRs and conclude that sensitivity is still the most
likely factor responsible for the lack of pulsars in some remnants.

The morphology-density relation manifests the environmental dependence of the formation and
evolution of galaxies as they continuously migrate through the cosmic web to ever denser environments.
As gas-rich galaxies traverse the outskirts and inner regions of galaxy clusters they experience
sudden and radical changes in their gas content and star formation activity. The goal of this work
is to gain an H$\,$I perspective on gas depletion mechanisms acting on galaxies and galaxy groups
that are being accreted by a moderately massive galaxy cluster. We aim to study the relative importance
and efficiency of processes such as ram-pressure stripping and tidal interactions as well as their
dependency on the local and global environment of galaxies in the cluster core and in its surroundings.
We have conducted a blind radio continuum and H$\,$I spectral line imaging survey with the MeerKAT
radio telescope of a 2$^\circ$ $\times$ 2$^\circ$ area centred on the galaxy cluster Abell 2626.
We have used the CARAcal pipeline to reduce the data, SoFiA to detect sources within the H$\,$I data
cube, and GIPSY to construct spatially resolved information on the H$\,$I morphologies and kinematics
of the H$\,$I detected galaxies. We have detected H$\,$I in 219 galaxies with optical counterparts
within the entire surveyed volume. We present the H$\,$I properties of each of the detected galaxies
as a data catalogue and as an atlas page for each galaxy, including H$\,$I column-density maps, velocity
fields, position-velocity diagrams and global H$\,$I profiles. These data will also be used for
case studies of identified ``jellyfish'' galaxies and galaxy population studies by means of morphological
classification of the direct H$\,$I detections as well as using the H$\,$I stacking technique.

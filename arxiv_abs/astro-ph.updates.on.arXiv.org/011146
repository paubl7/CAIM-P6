CS is among the most abundant gas-phase S-bearing molecules in cold dark molecular clouds. It is
easily observable with several transitions in the millimeter wavelength range, and has been widely
used as a tracer of the gas density in the interstellar medium in our Galaxy and external galaxies.
Chemical models fail to account for the observed CS abundances when assuming the cosmic value for
the elemental abundance of sulfur. The CS+O -> CO + S reaction has been proposed as a relevant CS destruction
mechanism at low temperatures, and could explain the discrepancy between models and observations.
Its reaction rate has been experimentally measured at temperatures of 150-400 K, but the extrapolation
to lower temperatures is doubtful. Here we calculate the CS+O reaction rate at temperatures <150
K which are prevailing in the interstellar medium. We performed ab initio calculations to obtain
the three lowest PES of the CS+O system. These PESs are used to study the reaction dynamics, using
several methods to eventually calculate the CS+O thermal reaction rates. We compare the results
of our theoretical calculations for 150-400 K with those obtained in the laboratory. Our detailed
theoretical study on the CS+O reaction, which is in agreement with the experimental data obtained
at 150-400 K, demonstrates the reliability of our approach. After a careful analysis at lower temperatures,
we find that the rate constant at 10 K is negligible, which is consistent with the extrapolation of
experimental data using the Arrhenius expression. We use the updated chemical network to model
the sulfur chemistry in TMC1 based on molecular abundances determined from GEMS project observations.
In our model, we take into account the expected decrease of the cosmic ray ionization rate along the
cloud. The abundance of CS is still overestimated when assuming the cosmic value for the sulfur abundance.

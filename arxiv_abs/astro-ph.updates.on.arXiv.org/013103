NGC 6522 is a moderately metal-poor bulge globular cluster ([Fe/H]$\sim$$-$1.0), and it is a well-studied
representative among a number of moderately metal-poor blue horizontal branch clusters located
in the bulge. The NGC 6522 abundance pattern can give hints on the earliest chemical enrichment in
the central Galaxy. The aim of this study is to derive abundances of the light elements C and N; alpha
elements O, Mg, Si, Ca, and Ti; odd-Z elements Na and Al; neutron-capture elements Y, Zr, Ba, La, and
Nd; and the r-process element Eu. We verify if there are first- and second-generation stars: we find
clear evidence of Na-Al, Na-N, and Mg-Al correlations, while we cannot identify the Na-O anti-correlation
from our data. High-resolution spectra of six red giants in the bulge globular cluster NGC 6522 were
obtained at the 8m VLT UT2-Kueyen telescope in FLAMES+UVES configuration. In light of Gaia data,
it turned out that two of them are non-members, but these were also analysed. Spectroscopic parameters
were derived through the excitation and ionisation equilibrium of FeI and FeII lines from UVES spectra.
The abundances were obtained with spectrum synthesis. The present analysis combined with previous
UVES results gives a mean radial velocity of vrhel = -15.62+-7.7 km.s-1 and a metallicity of [Fe/H]
= -1.05+-0.20 for NGC 6522. Mean abundances of alpha elements for the present four member stars are
enhanced with [O/Fe]=+0.38, [Mg/Fe]=+0.28, [Si/Fe]=+0.19, and [Ca/Fe]=+0.13, together with
the iron-peak element [Ti/Fe]=+0.13, and the r-process element [Eu/Fe]=+0.40.The neutron-capture
elements Y, Zr, Ba, and La show enhancements in the +0.08 < [Y/Fe] < +0.90, 0.11 < [Zr/Fe] < +0.50, 0.00
< [Ba/Fe] < +0.63, 0.00 < [La/Fe] < +0.45, and -0.10 < [Nd/Fe] < +0.70 ranges. We also discuss the spread
in heavy-element abundances.

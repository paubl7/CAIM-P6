We present and analyze ALMA submillimeter observations from a multi-wavelength campaign of Sgr
A* during 18 July 2019. In addition to the submillimeter, we utilize concurrent mid-IR (Spitzer)
and X-ray (Chandra) observations. The submillimeter emission lags $\delta t=21.48^{+3.44}_{-3.57}$
minutes behind the mid-IR data. The entire submillimeter flare was not observed, raising the possibility
that the time delay is a consequence of incomplete sampling of the light curve. The decay of the submillimeter
emission is not consistent with synchrotron cooling. Therefore, we analyze these data adopting
an adiabatically expanding synchrotron source that is initially optically thick or thin in the
submillimeter, yielding time-delayed or synchronous flaring with the IR, respectively. The time-delayed
model is consistent with a plasma blob of radius $0.8~R_{\text{S}}$ (Schwarzschild radius), electron
power-law index $p=3.5$ ($N(E)\propto E^{-p}$), equipartition magnetic field of $B_{\text{eq}}\approx90$
Gauss, and expansion velocity $v_{\text{exp}}\approx0.004c$. The simultaneous emission is
fit by a plasma blob of radius $2~R_{\text{S}}$, $p=2.5$, $B_{\text{eq}}\approx27$ Gauss, and
$v_{\text{exp}}\approx0.014c$. Since the submillimeter time delay is not completely unambiguous,
we cannot definitely conclude which model better represents the data. This observation presents
the best evidence for a unified flaring mechanism between submillimeter and X-ray wavelengths
and places significant constraints on the source size and magnetic field strength. We show that
concurrent observations at lower frequencies would be able to determine if the flaring emission
is initially optically thick or thin in the submillimeter.

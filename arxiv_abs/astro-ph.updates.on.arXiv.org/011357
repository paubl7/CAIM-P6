A radio spectro-polarimeter was developed at the Gauribidanur radio observatory to study the characteristics
of the polarized radio waves that are emitted by the impetuous solar corona in the 50 - 500 MHz frequency
range. The instrument has three major components : a Cross-polarized Log-Periodic Dipole Antenna
(CLPDA), an analog receiver, and a digital receiver (spectrum analyzer). This article elaborates
the design and developmental aspects of the CLPDA, its characteristics and briefs about the configurations
of the analog and digital receivers, setting up of the spectro-polarimeter, stage-wise tests performed
to characterize it, etc. To demonstrate the instrumental capability, the estimation of the solar
coronal magnetic field strength (B {\it Vs} heliocentric height), using the spectral data obtained
with it, is exemplified. Throughout the above band, the CLPDA has a gain, return loss and polarization
cross-talk of $\approx$ 6.6 dBi, $\lesssim$ -10 dB, and $\lesssim$ -27 dB, respectively. The design
constraints, the procedure to tune its impedance and to minimize its dimension, etc. are elaborated.
The analog receiver has a noise figure of $\approx 3$ dB and a receiver-noise-temperature ($T_{rcvr}$)
of about 290 K. The receiver-flux-density ($S_{rcvr}$) is $\approx 5.3 \times 10^3 $, and $\approx
5.3 \times 10^5$ Jy at 50 and 500 MHz, respectively. The observed spectral data shows a Signal-to-Noise
Ratio and Dynamic range of about 30 dB and 40 dB, respectively, at 50 MHz. The average polarization
isolation / cross-talk of the CLPD varies from -30 dB to -24 dB over an azimuthal angle of $\pm 45^\circ$
with respect to the reference position angle ($0^\circ$). The average degree of circular polarization
(DCP) is $\approx 100\%$ at the reference position and found to decrease gradually and reaches $\approx
80\%$ at an azimuthal angle of $\pm 45^\circ$.

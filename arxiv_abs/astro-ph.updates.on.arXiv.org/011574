We study a sample of bar-like galaxies in the Illustris TNG100 simulation, in which almost the whole
stellar component is in the form of a prolate spheroid. The sample is different from the late-type
barred galaxies studied before. In addition to the requirement of a high enough stellar mass and
resolution, the 277 galaxies were selected based on the single condition of a low enough ratio of
the intermediate to long axis of the stellar component. We followed the mass and shape evolution
of the galaxies as well as their interactions with other objects and divided them into three classes
based on the origin of the bar and the subsequent history. In galaxies of class A (comprising 28% of
the sample), the bar was induced by an interaction with a larger object, most often a cluster or group
central galaxy, and the galaxies were heavily stripped of dark matter and gas. In classes B and C (27%
and 45% of the sample, respectively) the bars were induced by a merger or a passing satellite, or they
were formed by disk instability. Class B galaxies were then partially stripped of mass, while those
of class C evolved without strong interactions, thus retaining their dark matter and gas in the outskirts.
We illustrate the properties of the different classes with three representative examples of individual
galaxies. In spite of the different evolutionary histories, the bars are remarkably similar in
strength, length, and formation times. The gas fraction in the baryonic component within two stellar
half-mass radii at the time of bar formation is always below 0.4 and usually very low, which confirms
in the cosmological context the validity of this threshold, which has previously been identified
in controlled simulations. Observational counterparts of these objects can be found among early-type
fast rotators, S0 galaxies, or red spirals with bars.

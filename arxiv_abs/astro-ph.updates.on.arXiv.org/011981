The excitation of the filamentary gas structures surrounding giant elliptical galaxies at the
center of cool-core clusters, a.k.a BCGs (brightest cluster galaxies), is key to our understanding
of active galactic nucleus feedback, and of the impact of environmental and local effects on star
formation. We investigate the contribution of the thermal radiation from the cooling flow surrounding
BCGs to the excitation of the filaments. We explore the effects of small levels of extra-heating
(turbulence), and of metallicity, on the optical and infrared lines. Using the Cloudy code, we model
the photoionization and photodissociation of a slab of gas of optical depth AV{\leq}30mag at constant
pressure, in order to calculate self-consistently all of the gas phases, from ionized gas to molecular
gas. The ionizing source is the EUV and soft X-ray radiation emitted by the cooling gas. We test these
models comparing their predictions to the rich multi-wavelength observations, from optical to
submillimeter. These models reproduce most of the multi-wavelength spectra observed in the nebulae
surrounding the BCGs, not only the LINER-like optical diagnostics: [O iii]{\lambda} 5007 {\AA}/H\b{eta},
[N ii]{\lambda} 6583 {\AA}/H{\alpha} and ([S ii]{\lambda} 6716 {\AA}+[S ii]{\lambda} 6731 {\AA})/H{\alpha}
but also the infrared emission lines from the atomic gas. The modeled ro-vib H2 lines also match observations,
which indicates that near and mid-IR H2 lines are mostly excited by collisions between H2 molecules
and secondary electrons produced naturally inside the cloud by the interaction between the X-rays
and the cold gas in the filament. However, there is still some tension between ionized and molecular
line tracers (i.e. CO), which requires to optimize the cloud structure and the density of the molecular
zone.

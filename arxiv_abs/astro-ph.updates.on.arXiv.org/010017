Neutrinos emitted in the coalescence of two neutron stars affect the dynamics of the outflow ejecta
and the nucleosynthesis of heavy elements. In this work, we analyze the neutrino emission properties
and the conditions leading to the growth of flavor instabilities in merger remnants consisting
of a hypermassive neutron star and an accretion disk during the first 10 ms after the merger. The analyses
are based on hydrodynamical simulations that include a modeling of neutrino emission and absorption
effects via the "Improved Leakage-Equilibration-Absorption Scheme" (ILEAS). We also examine
the nucleosynthesis of the heavy elements via the rapid neutron-capture process (r-process) inside
the material ejected during this phase. The dominant emission of $\bar\nu_e$ over $\nu_e$ from
the merger remnant leads to favorable conditions for the occurrence of fast pairwise flavor conversions
of neutrinos, independent of the chosen equation of state or the mass ratio of the binary. The nucleosynthesis
outcome is very robust, ranging from the first to the third r-process peaks. In particular, more
than $10^{-5}$ $M_\odot$ of strontium are produced in these early ejecta that may account for the
GW170817 kilonova observation. We find that the amount of ejecta containing free neutrons after
the $r$-process freeze-out, which may power early-time UV emission, is reduced by roughly a factor
of 10 when compared to simulations that do not include weak interactions. Finally, the potential
flavor equipartition between all neutrino flavors is mainly found to affect the nucleosynthesis
outcome in the polar ejecta within $\lesssim 30^\circ$, by changing the amount of the produced iron-peak
and first-peak nuclei, but it does not alter the lanthanide mass fraction therein.

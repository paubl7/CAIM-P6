Submillimetre galaxies (SMGs) are bright sources at submillimetre wavelengths. Made up of mostly
of high-z galaxies, SMGs are amongst the most luminous dusty galaxies in the Universe. Studying
their environments and clustering strength is thus important to put these galaxies in a cosmological
context. We present an environmental study of a sample of 116 SMGs in 96 ALMA observation fields,
which were initially discovered with the AzTEC camera on ASTE and identified with high-resolution
ALMA imaging within the COSMOS survey field, having either spectroscopic or unambiguous photometric
redshift. We analysed their environments making use of the latest release of the COSMOS photometric
catalogue, COSMOS2015, a catalogue that contains precise photometric redshifts for more than
half a million objects over the 2deg2 COSMOS field. We searched for dense galaxy environments computing
the so-called overdensity parameter as a function of distance within a radius of 5 arcmin from the
SMG. We validated this approach spectroscopically for those SMGs for which spectroscopic redshift
is available. As an additional test, we searched for extended X-ray emission as a proxy for the hot
intracluster medium, performing an X-ray stacking analysis in the 0.5-2 keV band with a 32 arcsec
aperture and our SMG position using all available XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray observations of
the COSMOS field. We find that 27% (31 out of 116) of the SMGs in our sample are located in a galactic
dense environment; a fraction that is similar to previous studies. The spectroscopic redshift
is known for 15 of these 31 sources, thus this photometric approach is tested using spectroscopy.
We are able to confirm that 7 out of 15 SMGs lie in high-density peaks. However, the search for associated
extended X-ray emission via an X-ray stacking analysis leads to a detection that is not statistically
significant.

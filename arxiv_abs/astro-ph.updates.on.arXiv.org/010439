The Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) effect provides a powerful cosmological probe, which traditionally
is approached independently as cluster number count (CNC) or power spectrum (PS) analysis. Here,
we devise a new method for analysing the $y$-map by introducing the survey completeness function,
conventionally only used in the CNC analysis, in the $yy$-PS modeling. This provides a systematic
method, based mainly on SZ observables, for obtaining two complementary $y$-maps, one incorporating
detected/resolved clusters and the other relying only on diffuse/unresolved SZ contributions.
We use the catalogue of clusters obtained in the \Planck CNC analysis to define the completeness
function linking these two $y$-maps. The split depends on the chosen signal-to-noise detection
threshold, which we vary in our discussion. We carefully propagate the effect of completeness cuts
on the non-Gaussian error contributions in the $yy$-PS analysis, highlighting the benefits of
masking massive clusters. Our analysis of the \Planck $yy$-PS for the unresolved component yields
a mass bias of $b=0.15\pm0.04$, consistent with the standard value ($b\approx0.2$), in comparison
to $b=0.4\pm 0.05$ for the total $yy$-PS. We find indications for this drift being driven by the CIB-tSZ
cross correlation, which dominantly originates from clusters in the resolved component of the
$y$-map. Another possible explanation is the presence of a mass-dependent bias, which has been
theoretically motivated and can be quantified with our novel method. We furthermore find first
hints for the presence of the 2-halo terms in the $yy$-PS. Finally, the proposed method provides
a new framework for combining the complementary information of the CNC and PS analyses in upcoming
SZ surveys.

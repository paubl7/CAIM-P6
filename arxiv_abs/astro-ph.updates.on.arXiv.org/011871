We present the direct detection of the splashback feature using the sample of massive galaxy clusters
from the Local Cluster Substructure Survey (LoCuSS). This feature is clearly detected (above $5\sigma$)
in the stacked luminosity density profile obtained using the K-band magnitudes of spectroscopically
confirmed cluster members. We obtained the best-fit model by means of Bayesian inference, which
ranked models including the splashback feature as more descriptive of the data with respect to models
that do not allow for this transition. In addition, we have assessed the impact of the cluster dynamical
state on the occurrence of the splashback feature. We exploited the extensive multi-wavelength
LoCuSS dataset to test a wide range of proxies for the cluster formation history, finding the most
significant dependence of the splashback feature location and scale according to the presence
or absence of X-ray emitting galaxy groups in the cluster infall regions. In particular, we report
for the first time that clusters that do not show massive infalling groups present the splashback
feature at a smaller clustercentric radius $ r_{\rm{sp}}/r_{\rm{200,m}} = 1.158 \pm 0.071$ than
clusters that are actively accreting groups $r_{\rm{sp}}/r_{\rm{200,m}} = 1.291 \pm 0.062$.
The difference between these two sub-samples is significant at $4.2\sigma$, suggesting a correlation
between the properties of the cluster potential and its accretion rate and merger history. Similarly,
clusters that are classified as old and dynamically inactive present stronger signatures of the
splashback feature, with respect to younger, more active clusters. We are directly observing how
fundamental dynamical properties of clusters reverberate across vastly different physical scales.

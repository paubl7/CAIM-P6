We present an overview of the Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral Field Spectroscopy (MAGPI)
survey, a Large Program on the European Southern Observatory Very Large Telescope. MAGPI is designed
to study the physical drivers of galaxy transformation at a lookback time of 3-4 Gyr, during which
the dynamical, morphological, and chemical properties of galaxies are predicted to evolve significantly.
The survey uses a combination of new medium-deep adaptive optics aided Multi Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer (MUSE) observations and publicly available ultraviolet-to-infrared imaging from the
Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. With these data, MAGPI will map the kinematic and chemical
properties of stars and ionised gas for a sample of 60 massive ($> 7 \times 10^{10} M_\odot$) central
galaxies at $0.25 < z <0.35$ in a representative range of environments. The spatial resolution delivered
by MUSE with Ground Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO, $0.6-0.8$ arcsec FWHM) will facilitate a direct
comparison with Integral Field Spectroscopy surveys of the nearby Universe, such as SAMI and MaNGA,
and at higher redshifts using adaptive optics. In addition to the primary (central) galaxy sample,
MAGPI will deliver resolved and unresolved spectra for as many as 150 satellite galaxies at $0.25
< z <0.35$, as well as hundreds of emission-line sources at $z < 6$. This paper outlines the science
goals, survey design, and observing strategy of MAGPI. We also present a first look at the MAGPI data,
and the theoretical framework to they will be compared using the current generation of cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations. Our results show that cosmological hydrodynamical simulations
make discrepant predictions in the spatially resolved properties of galaxies at $z\approx 0.3$.
MAGPI observations will place new constraints and allow for tangible improvements in galaxy formation
theory.

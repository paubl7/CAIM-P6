We present Ly$\alpha$ and ultraviolet-continuum (UV) luminosity functions (LFs) of galaxies
and active galactic nuclei (AGN) at $z=2.0-3.5$ determined by the un-targetted optical spectroscopic
survey of the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX). We combine deep Subaru imaging
with HETDEX spectra resulting in $11.4$ deg$^2$ of fiber-spectra sky coverage, obtaining $18320$
galaxies spectroscopically identified with Ly$\alpha$ emission, $2126$ of which host type 1 AGN
showing broad (FWHM$~>1000$ km s$^{-1}$) Ly$\alpha$ emission lines. We derive the Ly$\alpha$
(UV) LF over 2 orders of magnitude covering bright galaxies and AGN in $\log L_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}/\mathrm{[erg~s^{-1}]}=43.3-45.2$
($-27<M_\mathrm{UV}<-20$) by the $1/V_\mathrm{max}$ estimator. Our results reveal the bright-end
hump of the Ly$\alpha$ LF is composed of type 1 AGN. In conjunction with previous spectroscopic results
at the faint end, we measure a slope of the best-fit Schechter function to be $\alpha_\mathrm{Sch}=-1.70^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$,
which indicates $\alpha_\mathrm{Sch}$ steepens from $z=2-3$ towards high redshift. Our UV LF
agrees well with previous AGN UV LFs, and extends to faint-AGN and bright-galaxy regimes. The number
fraction of Ly$\alpha$-emitting objects ($X_\mathrm{LAE}$) increases from $M_\mathrm{UV}^*\sim-21$
to bright magnitude due to the contribution of type 1 AGN, while previous studies claim that $X_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}$
decreases from faint magnitude to $M_\mathrm{UV}^*$, suggesting a valley in the $X_\mathrm{Ly\alpha}-$magnitude
relation at $M_\mathrm{UV}^*$. Comparing our UV LF of type 1 AGN at $z=2-3$ with those at $z=0$, we
find that the number density of faint ($M_\mathrm{UV}>-21$) type 1 AGN increases from $z\sim2$
to $z\sim0$ as opposed to the evolution of bright ($M_\mathrm{UV}<-21$) type 1 AGN, suggesting
the AGN downsizing in the rest-frame UV luminosity.

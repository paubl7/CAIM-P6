Using high-resolution ground-based transmission spectroscopy to probe exoplanetary atmospheres
is difficult due to the inherent telluric contamination from absorption in Earth's atmosphere.
A variety of methods have previously been used to remove telluric features in the optical regime
and calculate the planetary transmission spectrum. In this paper we present and compare two such
methods, specifically focusing on Na detections using high-resolution optical transmission
spectra: (a) calculating the telluric absorption empirically based on the airmass, and (b) using
a model of the Earth's transmission spectrum. We test these methods on the transmission spectrum
of the hot Jupiter HD 189733 b using archival data obtained with the HARPS spectrograph during three
transits. Using models for Centre-to-Limb Variation and the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect, spurious
signals which are imprinted within the transmission spectrum are reduced. We find that correcting
tellurics with an atmospheric model of the Earth is more robust and produces consistent results
when applied to data from different nights with changing atmospheric conditions. We confirm the
detection of sodium in the atmosphere of HD 189733 b, with doublet line contrasts of -0.64 $\pm$ 0.07
% (D2) and -0.53 $\pm$ 0.07 % (D1). The average line contrast corresponds to an effective photosphere
in the Na line located around 1.13 $R_p$. We also confirm an overall blueshift of the line centroids
corresponding to net atmospheric eastward winds with a speed of 1.8 $\pm$ 1.2 km/s. Our study highlights
the importance of accurate telluric removal for consistent and reliable characterisation of exoplanetary
atmospheres using high-resolution transmission spectroscopy.

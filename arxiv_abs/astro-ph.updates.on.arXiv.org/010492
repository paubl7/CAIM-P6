The near-Earth objects (NEOs) (3200) Phaethon and (155140) 2005 UD are thought to share a common
origin, with the former exhibiting dust activity at perihelion that is thought to directly supply
the Geminid meteor stream. Both of these objects currently have very small perihelion distances,
which results in them having perihelion temperatures of or exceeding 1000 K. The current activity
from Phaethon is relevant to the destruction of NEOs close to the Sun, which most likely has produced
meteor streams linked to asteroids in the past. We model the past thermal characteristics of Phaethon
and 2005 UD using a combination of a thermophysical model (TPM) and orbital integrations of each
object. Temperature characteristics such as maximum daily temperature, maximum thermal gradient,
and temperature at varying depths are extracted from the model, which is run for a predefined set
of a and e. Next, dynamical integrations of orbital clones of Phaethon and 2005 UD are used to estimate
the past orbital elements of each object. These dynamical results are then combined with the temperature
characteristics to model the past evolution of thermal characteristics such as maximum (and minimum)
surface temperature and thermal gradient. We find that dwarf planet (2) Pallas is unlikely to be
the parent body for Phaethon and 2005 UD, and it is more likely that the source is in the inner part of
the asteroid belt. The orbital histories of Phaethon and 2005 UD are characterized by cyclic changes
in, resulting in perihelia values periodically shifting between present-day values and 0.3 au.
We find that the subsurface temperatures are too large over this timescale for water ice to be stable
unless actively supplied somehow. The near-surface thermal gradients strongly suggest that thermal
fracturing may be very effective at breaking down surface regolith.

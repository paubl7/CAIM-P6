Theoretical investigations have provided proof-of-principle calculations suggesting measurements
of stellar or pulsar orbits near the Galactic Center could strongly constrain the properties of
the Galactic Center black hole, local matter, and even the theory of gravity itself. In this work,
we develop both a Markov chain Monte Carlo and an analytic model (Fisher matrix) to understand what
properties are well-constrained and why. We conclude that existing astrometric measurements
cannot constrain the spin of the Galactic Center black hole. Extrapolating to the precision and
cadence of future experiments, we anticipate that the black hole spin can be measured with the known
star S2. Our calculations show that we can measure the dimensionless black hole spin to a precision
of $\sim$0.1 with weekly measurements of the orbit of S2 for 40 years using the GRAVITY telescope's
best resolution at the Galactic Center. An analytic expression is derived for the measurement uncertainty
of the black hole spin using the Fisher matrix in terms of observation strategy, star's orbital parameters,
and instrument resolution. From it, we conclude that highly eccentric orbits can provide better
constraints on the spin and that an orbit with a higher eccentricity is more favorable even when the
orbital period is longer. We also apply it to S62, S4711, and S4714 and show whether they can constrain
the black hole spin sooner than S2. If in addition, future measurements include the discovery of
a new, tighter stellar orbit, then future data could conceivably enable tests of strong field gravity,
by directly measuring the black hole quadrupole moment. Our simulations show that with a stellar
orbit similar to that of S2 but at one-fifth the distance to the Galactic Center and GRAVITY's resolution
limits, we can start to test the no-hair theorem with 20 years of weekly orbital measurements.

We derive dynamical parameters for a large sample of 446 $r$-process-enhanced (RPE) metal-poor
stars in the halo and disk systems of the Milky Way, based on data releases from the $R$-Process Alliance,
supplemented by additional literature samples. This sample represents more than a ten-fold increase
in size relative to that previously considered by Roederer et al., and, by design, covers a larger
range of $r$-process-element enrichment levels. We test a number of clustering analysis methods
on the derived orbital energies and other dynamical parameters for this sample, ultimately deciding
on application of the HDBSCAN algorithm, which obtains 30 individual Chemo-Dynamically Tagged
Groups (CDTGs); 21 contain between 3 and 5 stars, and 9 contain between 6 and 12 stars. Even though
the clustering was performed solely on the basis of their dynamical properties, the stars in these
CDTGs exhibit statistically significant similarities in their metallicity ([Fe/H]), carbonicity
([C/Fe]), and neutron-capture element ratios ([Sr/Fe], [Ba/Fe], and [Eu/Fe]). These results
demonstrate that the RPE stars in these CDTGs have likely experienced common chemical-evolution
histories, presumably in their parent satellite galaxies or globular clusters, prior to being
disrupted into the Milky Way's halo. We also confirm the previous claim that the orbits of the RPE
stars preferentially exhibit pericentric distances that are substantially lower than the present
distances of surviving ultra-faint dwarf and canonical dwarf spheroidal galaxies, consistent
with the disruption hypothesis. The derived dynamical parameters for several of our CDTGs indicate
their association with previously known substructures, Dynamically Tagged Groups, and RPE Groups.

The nuclear stellar disc (NSD) is, together with the nuclear star cluster (NSC) and the central massive
black hole, one of the main components in the central parts of our Milky Way. However, until recently,
only few studies of the stellar content of the NSD have been obtained due to extreme extinction and
stellar crowding. With a dedicated KMOS (VLT, ESO) spectroscopic survey, we study the kinematics
and global metallicities of the NSD based on the observations of K/M giant stars. We trace radial
velocities and metallicities which were derived based on spectral indices (Na I and CO) along the
NSD and compare those with a Galactic Bulge sample of APOGEE (DR16) and data from the NSC. We find that
the metallicity distribution function and the fraction of metal-rich and metal-poor stars in the
NSD are different from the corresponding distributions and ratios of the NSC and the Galactic Bulge.
By tracing the velocity dispersion as a function of metallicity, we clearly see that the NSD is kinematically
cool and that the velocity dispersion decreases with increasing metallicity contrary to the inner
Bulge sample of APOGEE ($\rm |b| < 4^{o}$). Using molecular gas tracers ($\rm H_{2}CO$, CO(4-3))
of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) we find an astonishing agreement between the gas rotation and
the rotation of the metal-rich population indicating that the metal-rich stars could have formed
from gas in the CMZ. On the other hand, the metal-poor stars show a much slower rotation profile with
signs of counter-rotation indicating a different origin of these stars. Coupling kinematics with
global metallicities, our results demonstrate that the NSD is chemically and kinematically distinct
with respect to the inner Bulge indicating a different formation scenario.

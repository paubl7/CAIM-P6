Gaia Data Release 2 (DR2) was used to select a sample of 211 central stars of planetary nebulae (CSPNe)
with good quality astrometric measurements, that we refer to as GAPN, Golden Astrometry Planetary
Nebulae. Gaia astrometric and photometric measurements allowed us to derive accurate distances
and radii, and to calculate luminosities with the addition of self-consistent literature values.
Such information was used to plot the position of these stars in a Hertzsprung-Russel (HR) diagram
and to study their evolutionary status in comparison with CSPNe evolutionary tracks. The extremely
precise measurement of parallaxes and proper motions in Gaia DR2 has allowed us to search for wide
binary companions in a region close to each of the central stars in the GAPN sample. We limited our
search to a region around 20,000 AU of each CSPN to minimise accidental detections, and only considered
stars with good parallax and proper motions data, i.e. with errors below 30% in DR2. We determined
that the hypothetical binary pairs should show a statistically significant agreement for the three
astrometric quantities, i.e. parallax and both components of proper motions. We found 8 wide binary
systems among our GAPN sample. One of them is in a triple system. We compiled the astrometric and photometric
measurements of these binary systems and discussed them in comparison with previously published
searches for binaries in PNe. By analysing the position in the HR diagram of the companion stars using
Gaia photometry, we are able to estimatetheir temperatures, luminosities, masses and, for one
star, the evolutionary age. The derived quantities yield a consistent scenario when compared with
the corresponding values as obtained for the central stars using stellar evolutionary models in
the postAGB phase.

Context. Characterizing the evolution of protoplanetary disks is necessary to improve our understanding
of planet formation. Constraints on both dust and gas are needed to determine the dominant disk dissipation
mechanisms. Aims. We aim to compare the disk dust masses in the Chamaeleon II (Cha II) star-forming
region with other regions with ages between 1 and 10Myr. Methods. We use ALMA band 6 observations
(1.3 mm) to survey 29 protoplanetary disks in Cha II. Dust mass estimates are derived from the continuum
data. Results. Out of our initial sample of 29 disks, we detect 22 sources in the continuum, 10 in 12CO,
3 in 13CO, and none in C18O (J=2-1). Additionally, we detect two companion candidates in the continuum
and 12CO emission. Most disk dust masses are lower than 10Mearth, assuming thermal emission from
optically thin dust. We compare consistent estimations of the distributions of the disk dust mass
and the disk-to-stellar mass ratios in Cha II with six other low mass and isolated star-forming regions
in the age range of 1-10Myr: Upper Sco, CrA, IC 348, Cha I, Lupus, and Taurus. When comparing the dust-to-stellar
mass ratio, we find that the masses of disks in Cha II are statistically different from those in Upper
Sco and Taurus, and we confirm that disks in Upper Sco, the oldest region of the sample, are statistically
less massive than in all other regions. Performing a second statistical test of the dust mass distributions
from similar mass bins, we find no statistical differences between these regions and Cha II. Conclusions.
We interpret these trends, most simply, as a sign of decline in the disk dust masses with time or dust
evolution. Different global initial conditions in star-forming regions may also play a role, but
their impact on the properties of a disk population is difficult to isolate in star-forming regions
lacking nearby massive stars.

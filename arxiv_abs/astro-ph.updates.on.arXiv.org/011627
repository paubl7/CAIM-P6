We report the discovery of diffuse extended Ly-alpha emission from redshift 3.1 to 4.5, tracing
cosmic web filaments on scales of 2.5-4 comoving Mpc. These structures have been observed in overdensities
of Ly-alpha emitters in the MUSE Extremely Deep Field, a 140 hour deep MUSE observation located in
the Hubble Ultra Deep Field. Among the 22 overdense regions identified, 5 are likely to harbor very
extended Ly-alpha emission at high significance with an average surface brightness of $\mathrm{5
\times 10^{-20} erg s^{-1} cm^{-2} arcsec^{-2}}$. Remarkably, 70% of the total Ly-alpha luminosity
from these filaments comes from beyond the circumgalactic medium of any identified Ly-alpha emitters.
Fluorescent Ly-alpha emission powered by the cosmic UV background can only account for less than
34% of this emission at z$\approx$3 and for not more than 10% at higher redshift. We find that the bulk
of this diffuse emission can be reproduced by the unresolved Ly-alpha emission of a large population
of ultra low luminosity Ly-alpha emitters ($\mathrm{<10^{40} erg s^{-1}}$), provided that the
faint end of the Ly-alpha luminosity function is steep ($\alpha \lessapprox -1.8$), it extends
down to luminosities lower than $\mathrm{10^{38} - 10^{37} erg s^{-1}}$ and the clustering of these
Ly-alpha emitters is significant (filling factor $< 1/6$). If these Ly-alpha emitters are powered
by star formation, then this implies their luminosity function needs to extend down to star formation
rates $\mathrm{< 10^{-4} M_\odot yr^{-1}}$. These observations provide the first detection of
the cosmic web in Ly-alpha emission in typical filamentary environments and the first observational
clue for the existence of a large population of ultra low luminosity Ly-alpha emitters at high redshift.

The ubiquitous relativistic jet phenomena associated with black holes play a major role in high
and very-high-energy (VHE) astrophysics. In particular, observations have demonstrated that
blazars show VHE emission with time-variability from days (in the GeV band) to minutes (in the TeV
band), implying very compact emission regions. The real mechanism able to explain the particle
acceleration process responsible for this emission is still debated, but magnetic reconnection
has been lately discussed as a strong potential candidate and, in some circumstances, as the only
possible one. In this work, we present the results of three-dimensional special relativistic magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of the development of reconnection events driven by turbulence induced by current-driven
kink instability along a relativistic jet. We have performed a systematic identification of all
reconnection regions in the system, characterizing their local magnetic field topology and quantifying
the reconnection rates. We obtained average rates of $0.051\pm0.026$ (in units of the Alfv\'{e}n
speed) which are comparable to the predictions of the theory of turbulence-induced fast reconnection.
Detailed statistical analysis also demonstrated that the fast reconnection events follow a log-normal
distribution, which is a signature of its turbulent origin. To probe the robustness of our method,
we have applied our results to the blazar Mrk 421. Building a synthetic light curve from the integrated
power of the magnetic reconnection events, we evaluated the time-variability from a power spectral
density analysis, obtaining a good agreement with the observations in the GeV band. This suggests
that turbulent fast magnetic reconnection driven by kink instability can be a possible process
behind the high energy emission variability phenomena observed in blazars.

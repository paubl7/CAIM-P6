Time domain science has undergone a revolution over the past decade, with tens of thousands of new
supernovae (SNe) discovered each year. However, several observational domains, including SNe
within days or hours of explosion and faint, red transients, are just beginning to be explored. Here,
we present the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), a novel optical time-domain survey on the Pan-STARRS
telescopes. Our survey is designed to obtain well-sampled $griz$ light curves for thousands of
transient events up to $z \approx 0.2$. This large sample of transients with 4-band light curves
will lay the foundation for the Vera C. Rubin Observatory and the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope,
providing a critical training set in similar filters and a well-calibrated low-redshift anchor
of cosmologically useful SNe Ia to benefit dark energy science. As the name suggests, YSE complements
and extends other ongoing time-domain surveys by discovering fast-rising SNe within a few hours
to days of explosion. YSE is the only current four-band time-domain survey and is able to discover
transients as faint $\sim$21.5 mag in $gri$ and $\sim$20.5 mag in $z$, depths that allow us to probe
the earliest epochs of stellar explosions. YSE is currently observing approximately 750 square
degrees of sky every three days and we plan to increase the area to 1500 square degrees in the near future.
When operating at full capacity, survey simulations show that YSE will find $\sim$5000 new SNe per
year and at least two SNe within three days of explosion per month. To date, YSE has discovered or observed
8.3% of the transient candidates reported to the International Astronomical Union in 2020. We present
an overview of YSE, including science goals, survey characteristics and a summary of our transient
discoveries to date.

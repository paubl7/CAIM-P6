ANAIS (Annual modulation with NaI Scintillators) is a dark matter direct detection experiment
consisting of 112.5 kg of NaI(Tl) detectors in operation at the Canfranc Underground Laboratory
(LSC), in Spain, since August 2017. ANAIS' goal is to confirm or refute in a model independent way
the DAMA/LIBRA positive result: an annual modulation in the low-energy detection rate having all
the features expected for the signal induced by dark matter particles in a standard galactic halo.
This modulation, observed for about 20 years, is in strong tension with the negative results of other
very sensitive experiments, but a model-independent comparison is still lacking. By using the
same target material, NaI(Tl), such comparison is more direct and almost independent on dark matter
particle and halo models. Here, we present the annual modulation analysis corresponding to three
years of ANAIS data (for an effective exposure of 313.95 kg$\times$y), applying a blind procedure
which updates that developed for the 1.5 years analysis, and later applied to 2 years. The analysis
also improves the background modelling in the fitting of the region of interest rates. We obtain
for the best fit in the [1-6] keV ([2-6] keV) energy region a modulation amplitude of -0.0034$\pm$0.0042
cpd/kg/keV (0.0003$\pm$0.0037 cpd/kg/keV), supporting the absence of modulation in our data,
and incompatible with DAMA/LIBRA result at 3.3 (2.6) $\sigma$, for a sensitivity of 2.5 (2.7) $\sigma$.
Moreover, we include two complementary analyses: a phase-free annual modulation search and the
exploration of the possible presence of a periodic signal at other frequencies. Finally, we carry
out several consistency checks of our result, and we update the ANAIS-112 projected sensitivity
for the scheduled 5 years of operation.

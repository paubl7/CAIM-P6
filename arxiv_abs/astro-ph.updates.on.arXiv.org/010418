Sources at the brightest end of QSO luminosity function during the peak epoch of star formation and
black hole accretion (z~2-4, i.e. Cosmic noon) are privileged sites to study the feeding & feedback
cycle of massive galaxies. We perform the first systematic study of cold gas properties in the most
luminous QSOs, by characterising their host-galaxies and environment. We analyse ALMA, NOEMA
and JVLA observations of FIR continuum, CO and [CII] emission lines in eight QSOs ($L_{\rm Bol}>3\times10^{47}$
erg/s) from the WISSH sample at z~2.4-4.7. We report a 100% emission line detection rate and a 80%
detection rate in continuum emission, and we find CO emission to be consistent with the steepest
CO ladders observed so far. Sub-mm data reveal presence of (one or more) bright companion galaxies
around 80% of WISSH QSOs, at projected distances of 6-130 kpc. We observe a variety of sizes for the
molecular gas reservoirs (1.7-10 kpc), associated with rotating disks with disturbed kinematics.
WISSH QSOs typically show lower CO luminosity and higher star formation efficiency than FIR matched,
z~0-3 main-sequence galaxies, implying that, given the observed SFR ~170-1100 $M_\odot$/yr,
molecular gas is converted into stars on <50 Myr. Most targets show extreme dynamical to black-hole
mass ratios $M_{\rm dyn}/M_{\rm BH}\sim3-10$, two orders of magnitude smaller than local relations.
The molecular gas fraction in WISSH hosts is lower by a factor of ~10-100 than in star forming galaxies
with similar $M_*$. WISSH QSOs undergo an intense growth phase of both the central SMBH and host-galaxy.
They pinpoint high-density sites where giant galaxies assemble and mergers play a major role in
the build-up of the final host-galaxy mass. The observed low molecular gas fraction and short depletion
timescale are likely due to AGN feedback, as traced by fast AGN-driven ionised outflows in all our
targets.

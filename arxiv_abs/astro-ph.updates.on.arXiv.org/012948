Exploding granules have drawn renewed interest because of their interaction with the magnetic
field. Especially the newly forming downflow lanes developing in their centre seem to be eligible
candidates for the intensification of magnetic fields. We analyse spectroscopic data from two
different instruments in order to study the intricate velocity pattern within the newly forming
downflow lanes in detail. We aim to examine general properties of a number of exploding granules.
To gain a better understanding of the formation process of the developing intergranular lane in
exploding granules, we study the temporal evolution and height dependence of the line-of-sight
velocities at their formation location. Additionally, we search for evidence that exploding granules
act as acoustic sources. We investigated the evolution of several exploding granules using data
taken with the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer and the Imaging Magnetograph eXperiment.
Velocities for different heights of the solar atmosphere were determined by computing bisectors
of the Fe I 6173.0{\AA} and the Fe I 5250.2{\AA} lines. We performed a wavelet analysis to study the
intensity and velocity oscillations within and around exploding granules. We also compared our
findings with predictions of numerical simulations. We found that exploding granules have significantly
longer lifetimes than regular granules. Exploding granules larger than 3.8 arcsec form an independent
intergranular lane during their decay phase, while smaller granules usually fade away or disappear
into the intergranular area. For all exploding granules that form a new intergranular downflow
lane, we find a temporal height-dependent shift with respect to the maximum of the downflow velocity.
Our suggestion that this results from a complex atmospheric structure within the newly forming
downflow lane is supported by the simulations.

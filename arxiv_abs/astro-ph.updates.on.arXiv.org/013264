We used adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamic cosmological simulations of a $z=1$ Milky Way-type
galaxy and a $z=0$ Dwarf galaxy and generated synthetic quasar absorption-line spectra of their
circumgalactic medium (CGM). Our goal is to assess whether standard observational spectroscopic
analysis methods accurately reproduce intrinsic column densities, metallicities [Si/H], and
hydrogen densities $n_{H}$, in simulated absorption-line systems. Without knowledge of the intrinsic
simulated properties (blind study), we analysed synthetic COS and HIRES spectra with fixed $S/N=30$
to determine the column densities, metallicity, and $n_{H}$, using Voigt profile fitting combined
with Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo single-phase {\sc Cloudy} modelling techniques. To quantify the
intrinsic simulated absorbing gas properties, we objectively determined which gas cells along
a line of sight (LOS) contribute to detected absorption in the spectra and adopt the unweighted geometric
mean of these gas cell properties. For this pilot study, we performed this experiment for five LOS
in the Milky-Way galaxy and five LOS in the Dwarf galaxy. We found an average agreement between the
"observed" and intrinsic metallicity overestimated within $0.8\sigma$ or $0.2$ dex for the "Milky-Way"'
CGM and overestimated within $1.4\sigma$ or $0.2$ dex for the Dwarf galaxy CGM. We found that the
spectroscopically-derived $n_{H}$ are underestimated within $0.8\sigma$ or $0.4$ dex of the
intrinsic $n_{H}$ for the "Milky-Way" CGM and overestimated within $0.3\sigma$ or $0.3$ dex for
the Dwarf galaxy CGM. The overall agreement suggests that, for single-phase ionisation modelling
of systems where there is substantial spread in gas properties, global metallicity measurements
from quasar absorption line studies are capturing the {\it average\/} metallicity and ionisation
parameters in a given astrophysical environment.

We develop a hybrid model of galactic chemical evolution that combines a multi-ring computation
of chemical enrichment with a prescription for stellar migration and the vertical distribution
of stellar populations informed by a cosmological hydrodynamic disc galaxy simulation. Our fiducial
model adopts empirically motivated forms of the star formation law and star formation history,
with a gradient in outflow mass loading tuned to reproduce the observed metallicity gradient. With
this approach, the model reproduces many of the striking qualitative features of the Milky Way disc's
abundance structure: (i) the dependence of the [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] distribution on radius $R_\text{gal}$
and midplane distance $|z|$; (ii) the changing shapes of the [O/H] and [Fe/H] distributions with
$R_\text{gal}$ and $|z|$; (iii) a broad distribution of [O/Fe] at sub-solar metallicity and changes
in the [O/Fe] distribution with $R_\text{gal}$, $|z|$, and [Fe/H]; (iv) a tight correlation between
[O/Fe] and stellar age for [O/Fe] $>$ 0.1; (v) a population of young and intermediate-age $\alpha$-enhanced
stars caused by migration-induced variability in the Type Ia supernova rate; (vi) non-monotonic
age-[O/H] and age-[Fe/H] relations, with large scatter and a median age of $\sim$4 Gyr near solar
metallicity. Observationally motivated models with an enhanced star formation rate $\sim$2 Gyr
ago improve agreement with the observed age-[Fe/H] and age-[O/H] relations, but worsen agreement
with the observed age-[O/Fe] relation. None of our models predict an [O/Fe] distribution with the
distinct bimodality seen in the observations, suggesting that more dramatic evolutionary pathways
are required. All code and tables used for our models are publicly available through the Versatile
Integrator for Chemical Evolution (VICE; https://pypi.org/project/vice).

Context. The Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) near-infrared variability survey explores
some of the most complex regions of the Milky Way bulge and disk in terms of high extinction and high
crowding. Aims. We add a new wavelength dimension to the optical information available at the American
Association of Variable Star Observers International Variable Star Index (VSX-AAVSO) catalogue
to test the VVV survey near-infrared photometry to better characterise these objects. Methods.
We cross-matched the VVV and the VSX-AAVSO catalogues along with Gaia Data Release 2 photometry
and parallax. Results. We present a catalogue that includes accurate individual coordinates,
near-infrared magnitudes (ZY JHKs), extinctions Aks, and distances based on Gaia parallaxes.
We also show the near-infrared CMDs and spatial distributions for the different VSX types of variable
stars, including important distance indicators, such as RR Lyrae, Cepheids, and Miras. By analysing
the photometric flags in our catalogue, we found that about 20% of the stars with measured and verified
variability are flagged as non-stellar sources, even when they are outside of the saturation and/or
noise regimes. Additionally, we pair-matched our sample with the VIVA catalogue and found that
more than half of our sources are missing from the VVV variability list, mostly due to observations
with low signal-to-noise ratio or photometric problems with a low percentage due to failures in
the selection process. Conclusions. Our results suggest that the current knowledge of the variability
in the Galaxy is biased to nearby stars with low extinction. The present catalogue also provides
the groundwork for characterising the results of future large variability surveys such as the Vera
C. Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time in the highly crowded and reddened regions of
the Galactic plane, as well as follow-up campaigns for

We use X-ray Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) observed by the Chandra X-ray Observatory within the 9.3
deg$^2$ Bo$\rm \ddot{o}$tes field of the NDWFS to study whether there is a correlation between X-ray
luminosity (L$_X$) and star formation rate (SFR) of the host galaxy, at $\rm 0.5<z<2.0$, with respect
to the position of the galaxy to the main sequence (SFR$_{norm}$). About half of the sources in the
X-ray sample have spectroscopic redshifts. We also construct a reference galaxy catalogue. For
both datasets, we use photometric data from optical to the far infrared, compiled by the HELP project
and apply spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, using the X-CIGALE code. We exclude quiescent
sources from both the X-ray and the reference samples. We also account for the mass completeness
of our dataset, in different redshifts bins. Our analysis highlights the importance of studying
the SFR-L$_X$ relation, in a uniform manner, taking into account the systematics and selection
effects. Our results suggest that, in less massive galaxies ($\rm log\,[M_*(M_\odot)] \sim 11$),
AGN enhances the SFR of the host galaxy by $\sim 50\%$ compared to non AGN systems. A flat relation
is observed for the most massive galaxies. SFR$_{norm}$ does not evolve with redshift. The results,
although tentative, are consistent with a scenario in which, in less massive systems, both AGN and
star formation (SF) are fed by cold gas, supplied by a merger event. In more massive galaxies, the
flat relation could be explained by a different SMBH fuelling mechanism that is decoupled from the
star formation of the host galaxy (e.g. hot diffuse gas). Finally, we compare the host galaxy properties
of X-ray absorbed and unabsorbed sources. Our results show no difference which suggests that X-ray
absorption is not linked with the properties of the galaxy.

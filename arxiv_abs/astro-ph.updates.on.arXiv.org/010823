Aims: Our objective is the optical and near-infrared spectroscopic characterisation of 2MASS
J0249-0557 c, a recently discovered young planetary mass companion to the $\beta$ Pictoris member
2MASS J0249-0557. Methods: Using the Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA)
Hemisphere Survey (VHS) and the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) data, we independently identified
the companion 2MASS J0249-0557 c. We obtained low-resolution optical spectroscopy of this object
using the Optical System for Imaging and low-intermediate-Resolution Integrated Spectroscopy
(OSIRIS) spectrograph at the Gran Telescopio Canarias (GTC), and near-infrared spectroscopy
using the Son of Isaac (SofI) spectrograph on the New Technology Telescope (NTT). Results: We classified
2MASS J0249-0557 c with a spectral type of L2.5$\pm$0.5 in the optical and L3$\pm$1 in the near-infrared.
We identified spectroscopic indicators of youth that are compatible with the age of the $\beta$
Pictoris moving group. We also detect a strong H$\alpha$ emission, with a pEW of -90$^{+20}_{-40}$A,
which seems persistent in time. This indicates strong chromospheric activity or disk accretion.
Although many M-type brown dwarfs have strong H$\alpha$ emission, this target is one of the very
few L-type planetary mass objects in which this strong H$\alpha$ emission has been detected. Lithium
absorption at 6708 A is observed with pEW $\lesssim$ 5A. We also computed the binding energy of 2MASS
J0249-0557 c and obtained an (absolute) upper limit of $U=(-8.8\pm4.4) 10^{32}$ J. Conclusions:
Similarly to other young brown dwarfs and isolated planetary mass objects, strong H$\alpha$ emission
is also present in young planetary mass companions at ages of some dozen million years. We also found
that 2MASS J0249-0557 c is one of the wide substellar companions with the lowest binding energy known
to date.

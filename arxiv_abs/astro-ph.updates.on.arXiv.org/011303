(Abridged) Specific angular momentum is one of the key parameters that control the evolution of
galaxies. In this work, we derive the baryonic specific angular momentum of disc galaxies and study
its relation with the dark matter specific angular momentum. Using a combination of high-quality
HI rotation curves and HI/near-IR surface densities, we homogeneously measure the stellar ($j_{\rm
*}$) and gas ($j_{\rm gas}$) specific angular momenta for a large sample of local disc galaxies.
This allows us to determine the baryonic specific angular momentum ($j_{\rm bar}$) with high accuracy
and across a very wide range of masses. The $j_{\ast}-M_\ast$ relation is an unbroken power-law
from $7 \lesssim$ log($M_\ast$/$M_\odot) \lesssim 11.5$, with slope $0.54 \pm 0.02$. For the gas
component, we find that the $j_{\rm gas}-M_{\rm gas}$ relation is also an unbroken power-law from
$6 \lesssim$ log($M_{\rm gas}$/$M_\odot) \lesssim 11$, with a steeper slope of $1.01 \pm 0.04$.
Regarding the baryonic relation, our data support a correlation characterized by single power-law
with slope $0.58 \pm 0.02$. Our most massive spirals and smallest dwarfs lie along the same $j_{\rm
bar}-M_{\rm bar}$ sequence. While the relations are tight and unbroken, we find internal correlations
inside them: At fixed $M_\ast$, galaxies with larger $j_\ast$ have larger disc scale lengths, and
at fixed $M_{\rm bar}$, gas-poor galaxies have lower $j_{\rm bar}$ than expected. We estimate the
retained fraction of baryonic specific angular momentum, finding it constant across our entire
mass range with a value of 0.7, indicating that the $j_{\rm bar}$ of present-day disc galaxies is
comparable to the initial specific angular momentum of their dark matter haloes. These results
set important constraints for hydrodynamical simulations and semi-analytical models that aim
to reproduce galaxies with realistic specific angular momenta.

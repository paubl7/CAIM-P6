We use the IllustrisTNG (TNG) cosmological, hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation to
measure the velocity dispersion profiles of dark matter and star particles in Milky Way-mass, galaxy
group, and cluster-scale dark matter halos. The mean profile calculated from both dark and luminous
tracers are similar in shape, exhibiting a large degree of halo-to-halo scatter around the average
profile. The so-called "splashback" radius demarcates the outer boundary of the halo, and manifests
as a kink in the velocity dispersion profile, located on average between $\sim 1.0-1.5r_{200m}$,
where $r_{200m}$ is the radius within which the enclosed density of the halo equals 200 times the
mean background density of the universe at that redshift. Interestingly, we find that this location
may also be identified as the radius at which the (stacked) velocity dispersion profile drops to
60% of its peak value (for line-of-sight motions of stellar and dark matter particles in TNG halos).
We further show that the scatter in the velocity dispersion profiles may be attributed to the variations
in the assembly history of the host halos. In particular, this segregates the profile into two regimes:
one within $\sim0.1r_{200m}$, where the scatter in the velocity dispersion within is set by the
early assembly history of the halo, and the other beyond this radius where the scatter in the velocity
dispersion is influenced more strongly by its late-time assembly. Finally, we show that a two-parameter
model can be used to fit the measured velocity dispersion profiles and the fit parameters can be related
directly to two fundamental halo properties: mass and concentration. We describe a simple model
which allows us to express the stellar velocity dispersion profile in terms of the mass and concentration
of the host halo as the only free parameters.

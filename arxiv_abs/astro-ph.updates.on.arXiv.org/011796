Context. We have presented a numerical model for the non-thermal emission of gamma-ray binaries
in a pulsar-wind driven scenario. Aims. We apply this model to one of the best-observed gamma-ray
binaries, the LS 5039 system. Methods. The model involves a joint simulation of the pulsar- and stellar-wind
interaction and the transport of electronic pairs from the pulsar wind accelerated at the emerging
shock structure. We compute the synchrotron and inverse Compton emission in a post-processing
step, while consistently accounting for relativistic beaming and $\gamma \gamma$-absorption
in the stellar radiation field. Results. The stellar- and pulsar-wind interaction leads to the
formation of an extended, asymmetric wind collision region developing strong shocks, turbulent
mixing, and secondary shocks in the turbulent flow. Both the structure of the collision region and
the resulting particle distributions show significant orbital variation. Next to the acceleration
of particles at the bow-like pulsar wind and Coriolis shock the model naturally accounts for the
reacceleration of particles at secondary shocks contributing to the emission at very-high-energy
(VHE) gamma-rays. The model successfully reproduces the main spectral features of LS 5039. While
the predicted lightcurves in the high-energy and VHE gamma-ray band are in good agreement with observations,
our model still does not reproduce the X-ray to low-energy gamma-ray modulation, which we attribute
to the employed magnetic field model. Conclusions. We successfully model the main spectral features
of the observed multiband, non-thermal emission of LS 5039 and thus further substantiates a wind-driven
interpretation of gamma-ray binaries. Open issues relate to the synchrotron modulation, which
might be addressed through a magnetohydrodynamic extension of our model.

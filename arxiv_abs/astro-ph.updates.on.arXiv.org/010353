The present work presents our efforts at identifying new mercury-manganese (HgMn/CP3) stars using
spectra obtained with the Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope (LAMOST).
Suitable candidates were searched for among pre-selected early-type spectra from LAMOST DR4 using
a modified version of the MKCLASS code that probes several Hg II and Mn II features. The spectra of
the resulting 332 candidates were visually inspected. Using parallax data and photometry from
Gaia DR2, we investigated magnitudes, distances from the Sun, and the evolutionary status of our
sample stars. We also searched for variable stars using diverse photometric survey sources. We
present 99 bona fide CP3 stars, 19 good CP3 star candidates, and seven candidates. Our sample consists
of mostly new discoveries and contains, on average, the faintest CP3 stars known (peak distribution
9.5 < G < 13.5 mag). All stars are contained within the narrow spectral temperature-type range from
B6 to B9.5, in excellent agreement with the expectations and the derived mass estimates (2.4 < M(Sun)
< 4 for most objects). Our sample stars are between 100 Myr and 500 Myr old and cover the whole age range
from zero-age to terminal-age main sequence. They are almost homogeneously distributed at fractional
ages on the main sequence < 80%, with an apparent accumulation of objects between fractional ages
of 50% to 80%. We find a significant impact of binarity on the mass and age estimates. Eight photometric
variables were discovered, most of which show monoperiodic variability in agreement with rotational
modulation. Together with the recently published catalogue of APOGEE CP3 stars, our work significantly
increases the sample size of known Galactic CP3 stars, paving the way for future in-depth statistical
studies.

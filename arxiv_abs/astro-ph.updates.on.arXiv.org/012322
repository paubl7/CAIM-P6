Our Milky Way (MW) has witnessed a series of major accretion events. One of the later additions, Gaia-Enceladus,
has contributed a considerable mass to the inner Galaxy, but also generously donated to the outer
halo. So far, associations with present-day MW globular clusters (GCs) have been chiefly based
on their kinematics and ages. Here, we present a chemical abundance study of the outer halo (R$_{\rm
GC}$=18 kpc) GC NGC 1261, which has been suggested to be an accreted object. We measured 31 species
of 29 elements in two stars from high-resolution Magellan/MIKE spectra and find that the cluster
is moderately metal poor, at [Fe/H]=-1.26. NGC 1261 is moderately $\alpha$-enhanced to the 0.3-dex
level. While from the small sample alone it remains vague to assert any abundance correlations,
the light elements Na,O,Mg, and Al differ significantly between the two stars, in contrast to the
majority of other elements with smaller scatter, arguing in favour of multiple generations of stars
coexisting in this GC. Intriguingly for its metallicity, NGC 1261 shows heavy element abundances
that are consistent with $r$-process nucleosynthesis and we discuss their origin in various sites.
In particular the Eu-overabundance quantitatively suggests that one single $r$-process event,
such as a neutron-star neutron-star merger or a rare kind of supernova, can be responsible for the
stellar enhancement or even the cluster's enrichment with the excess $r$-material. Its heavy element
pattern makes NGC 1261 resemble the moderately enhanced r-I stars that are commonly found in the
halo and that have been detected in Gaia-Enceladus as well. Therefore, combining all kinematical,
age, and chemical evidence we conclude that NGC 1261 is a chemically intriguing GC that was born in
Gaia-Enceladus and has been subsequently accreted into the MW halo. [abridged]

An improved high-resolution ground-to-thermosphere version of the Institut Pierre-Simon Laplace
(IPSL) Venus General Circulation Model (VGCM), including non-orographic gravity waves (GW) parameterization
and fine-tuned non-LTE parameters, is presented here. We focus on the validation of the model built
from a collection of data mostly from Venus Express experiments and coordinated ground-based telescope
campaigns, in the upper mesosphere/lower thermosphere of Venus. These simulations result in an
overall better agreement with temperature observations above 90 km, compared with previous versions
of the VGCM. Density of CO2 and light species (CO and O) are also comparable with observations in terms
of trend and order of magnitude. Systematic biases in the temperature structure are found at about
80-100 km and above 130 km at the terminator, possibly due to assumptions on the CO2 mixing ratio made
for stellar/solar occultation retrievals and uncertainties on the collisional rate coefficients
used in the non-LTE parameterization, respectively. Diurnal and latitudinal distribution of
dynamical tracers are also analyzed. Overall, our simulations indicate that a weak westward retrograde
wind is present up to about 120 km, producing the CO bulge displacement toward 2h-3h in the morning,
instead of piling up at the anti-solar point, as for an idealised SS-AS circulation. This retrograde
imbalance is suggested to be produced by perturbations of about 5 days Kelvin wave impacting the
mesosphere up to 110 km (see the companion paper Navarro et al. 2021), combined with GW westward acceleration
mostly above 110 km. On the whole, these model developments point to the importance of the inclusion
of the lower atmosphere, higher resolution and finely tuned parameterizations in GCM of the Venusian
upper atmosphere, in order to shed light on existing observations.

We present analyses of near-infrared, spectroscopic data from the Apache Point Observatory Galactic
Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey for 45 previously confirmed or candidate white dwarf-main
sequence (WDMS) binaries identified by the optical SDSS and LAMOST surveys. Among these 45 systems,
we classify three as having red giant primaries in the LAMOST sample and fourteen to be young stellar
object contaminants in the photometrically identified SDSS sample. From among the subsample of
28 systems that we confirm to have MS primaries, we derive and place limits on orbital periods and
velocity amplitudes for fourteen. Seven systems have significant velocity variations that warrant
a post-common-envelope (PCE) binary classification -- four of which are newly classified, three
of which are newly confirmed, and five for which we can derive full orbital parameters. If confirmed,
one of these newly discovered systems (2M14544500+4626456) will have the second longest orbital
period reported for a typical, compact PCE WDMS binary ($P=15.1$ days). In addition to the seven
above, we also recover and characterize with APOGEE data the well known PCE WDMS systems EG UMa and
HZ 9. We also investigate the overall metallicity distribution of the WDMS sample, which is a parameter
space not often explored for these systems. Of note, we find one system (2M14244053+4929580) to
be extremely metal-poor (${\rm [Fe/H]}=-1.42$) relative to the rest of the near-solar sample.
Additionally, the PCE systems in our sample are found to be, on average, higher in metallicity than
their wide-binary counterparts, though we caution that with this small number of systems, the sample
may not be representative of the overall distribution of WDMS systems.

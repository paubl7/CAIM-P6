In 2007, the young star 1SWASP J140747.93-394542.6 (V1400 Cen) underwent a complex series of deep
eclipses over 56 days. This was attributed to the transit of a ring system filling a large fraction
of the Hill sphere of an unseen substellar companion. Subsequent photometric monitoring has not
found any other deep transits from this candidate ring system, but if there are more substellar companions
and they are coplanar with the potential ring system, there is a chance that they will transit the
star as well. This young star is active and the light curves show a 5% modulation in amplitude with
a dominant rotation period of 3.2 days due to star spots rotating in and out of view. We model and remove
the rotational modulation of the J1407 light curve and search for additional transit signatures
of substellar companions orbiting around J1407. We combine the photometry of J1407 from several
observatories, spanning a 19 year baseline. We remove the rotational modulation by modeling the
variability as a periodic signal, whose periodicity changes slowly with time over several years
due to the activity cycle of the star. A Transit Least Squares (TLS) analysis searches for any periodic
transiting signals within the cleaned light curve. We identify an activity cycle of J1407 with a
period of 5.4 years. A Transit Least Squares search does not find any plausible periodic eclipses
in the light curve, from 1.2% amplitude at 5 days up to 1.9% at 20 days. This sensitivity is confirmed
by injecting artificial transits into the light curve and determining the recovery fraction as
a function of transit depth and orbital period. J1407 is confirmed as a young active star with an activity
cycle consistent with a rapidly rotating solar mass star. With the rotational modulation removed,
the TLS analysis rules out transiting companions with radii larger than about 1 Jupiter.

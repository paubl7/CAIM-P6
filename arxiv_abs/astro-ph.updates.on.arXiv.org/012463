We review the methodology for measurements of two point functions of the cosmological observables,
both power spectra and correlation functions. For pseudo-$C_\ell$ estimators, we will argue that
the window (or the selection function) weighted overdensity field can yield more optimal measurements
as the window acts as an inverse noise weight, an effect that becomes more important for surveys with
a variable selection function. We then discuss the impact of approximations made in the Master algorithm
and suggest improvements, the $i$Master algorithm, that uses the theoretical model to give unbiased
results for arbitrarily complex windows provided that the model satisfies weak accuracy conditions.
The methodology of $i$Master algorithm is also generalized to the correlation functions to reconstruct
the binned power spectra, for E/B mode separation, or to properly smooth the correlation functions
to account for the scale cuts in the Fourier space model. We also discuss the impact of errors in the
window estimation and show that these errors have both an additive and multiplicative effects on
the over density field. Multiplicative effects show up as mis-estimated window power and are typically
higher order but can be important at the few percent precision requirements. Accurate estimation
of window power can be required up to scales of $\sim 2\ell_\text{max}$ or larger. Misestimation
of the window power leads to biases in the measured power spectra which scale as ${\delta C_\ell}\sim
M^W_{\ell\ell'}\delta W_{\ell'}$, where the $M^W_{\ell\ell'}$ scales as $\sim(2\ell+1)C_\ell$
leading to effects that can be important at high $\ell$. While the notation in this paper is geared
towards photometric galaxy surveys, the discussion is equally applicable to spectroscopic galaxy,
intensity mapping and CMB surveys.

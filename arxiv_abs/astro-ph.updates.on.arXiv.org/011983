The construction of constraint-satisfying initial data is an essential element for the numerical
exploration of the dynamics of compact-object binaries. While several codes have been developed
over the years to compute generic quasi-equilibrium configurations of binaries comprising either
two black holes, or two neutron stars, or a black hole and a neutron star, these codes are often not
publicly available or they provide only a limited capability in terms of mass ratios and spins of
the components in the binary. We here present a new open-source collection of spectral elliptic
solvers that are capable of exploring the major parameter space of binary black holes (BBHs), binary
neutron stars (BNSs), and mixed binaries of black holes and neutron stars (BHNSs). Particularly
important is the ability of the spectral-solver library to handle neutron stars that are either
irrotational or with an intrinsic spin angular momentum that is parallel to the orbital one. By supporting
both analytic and tabulated equations of state at zero or finite temperature, the new infrastructure
is particularly geared towards allowing for the construction of BHNS and BNS binaries. For the latter,
we show that the new solvers are able to reach the most extreme corners in the physically plausible
space of parameters, including extreme mass ratios and spin asymmetries, thus representing the
most extreme BNS computed to date. Through a systematic series of examples, we demonstrate that
the solvers are able to construct quasi-equilibrium and eccentricity-reduced initial data for
BBHs, BNSs, and BHNSs, achieving spectral convergence in all cases. Furthermore, using such initial
data, we have carried out evolutions of these systems from the inspiral to after the merger, obtaining
evolutions with eccentricities $\lesssim 10^{-4}-10^{-3}$, and accurate gravitational waveforms.

We numerically investigate the evolution of compact high-velocity clouds (CHVCs) passing through
a hot, tenuous gas representing the highly-ionized circumgalactic medium (CGM) by applying the
adaptive-mesh refinement code FLASH. The model clouds start from both hydrostatic and thermal
equilibrium and are in pressure balance with the CGM. Here, we present 14 models, divided into two
mass categories and two metallicities each and different velocities. We allow for self-gravity
and thermal conduction or not. All models experience mass diffusion, radiative cooling, and external
heating leading to dissociation and ionization. Our main findings are: 1) self-gravity stabilizes
clouds against Rayleigh-Taylor instability which are disrupted within 10 sound-crossing times
without; 2) clouds can develop Jeans-instable regions internally even though they are initially
below Jeans mass; 3) all clouds lose mass by ram pressure and Kelvin-Helmholtz instability; 4) thermal
conduction substantially lowers mass-loss rates, by this, extending the clouds' lifetimes, particularly,
more than doubling the lifetime of low-mass clouds; 5) thermal conduction leads to continuous,
filamentary stripping, while the removed gas is heated up quickly and mixes efficiently with the
ambient CGM; 6) without thermal conduction the removed gas consists of dense, cool, clumpy fragments;
7) thermal conduction might prevent CHVCs from forming stars; 8) clouds decelerated by means of
drag from the ambient CGM form head-tail shapes and collapse after they reach velocities characteristic
for intermediate-velocity clouds. Conclusively, only sophisticated modelling of CHVCs as non-homogeneous
and non-isothermal clouds with thermal conduction and self-gravity explains observed morphologies
and naturally leads to the suppression of star formation.

We report on the population properties of the 47 compact binary mergers detected with a false-alarm
rate < 1 yr$^{-1}$ in the second LIGO--Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, GWTC-2. We
investigate the binary black hole (BBH) mass distribution, spin distribution, and merger rate
as a function of redshift, observing several BBH population characteristics not discernible until
now. First, we find the primary mass spectrum contains structure beyond a power-law with a sharp
high-mass cut-off; it is more consistent with a broken power law with a break at $39.7^{+20.3}_{-9.1}\,M_\odot$,
or a power law with a Gaussian feature peaking at $33.5^{+4.5}_{5.5}\,M_\odot$ (90% crediblity).
While the primary mass distribution must extend past $65\,M_\odot$, only $2.9^{+3.4}_{-1.7}\%$
of systems have primary masses greater than $45\,M_\odot$. At low masses, the primary mass spectrum
is consistent with a gap between $\sim2.6\,M_\odot$ and $\sim6\,M_\odot$. Second, we find that
a fraction of BBH systems have component spins misaligned with the orbital angular momentum, giving
rise to precession of the orbital plane. Moreover, 12% to 44% of BBH systems have spins tilted by more
than $90^\circ$, giving rise to a negative effective inspiral spin parameter. Third, we estimate
merger rates, finding $R_\mathrm{BBH} = 23.9^{+14.9}_{-8.6}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$
for BBH and $R_\mathrm{BNS} = {320}^{+490}_{-240}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$
for binary neutron stars (BNS). The BBH rate likely increases with redshift (85% credibility),
but not faster than the star-formation rate (87% credibility). Additionally, we examine recent
exceptional events in the context of our population models, finding that the asymmetric masses
of GW190412 and the high component masses of GW190521 are consistent with our models, but the low
secondary mass of GW190814 makes it an outlier.

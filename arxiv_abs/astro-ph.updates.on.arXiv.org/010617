In order to characterize and model the beam-weighted foreground for global 21-cm signal experiments,
we present a methodology for generating basis eigenvectors that combines analytical and observational
models of both the galactic spectral index and sky brightness temperature with simulations of beams
having various angular and spectral dependencies and pointings. Each combination creates a unique
beam-weighted foreground. By generating eigenvectors to fit each foreground model using Singular
Value Decomposition (SVD), we examine the effects of varying the components of the beam-weighted
foreground. We find that the eigenvectors for modelling an achromatic, isotropic beam -- the ideal
case -- are nearly identical regardless of the unweighted foreground model used, and are practicably
indistinguishable from polynomial-based models. When anisotropic, chromatic beams weight the
foreground, however, a coupling is introduced between the spatial and spectral structure of the
foreground which distorts the eigenvectors away from the polynomial models and induces a dependence
of the basis upon the exact features of the beam (chromaticity, pattern, pointing) and foreground
(spectral index, sky brightness temperature map). We find that the beam has a greater impact upon
the eigenvectors than foreground models. Any model which does not account for its distortion may
produce RMS uncertainties on the order of $\sim 10$ - $10^3$ Kelvin for six-parameter, single spectrum
fits. If the beam is incorporated directly using SVD and training sets, however, the resultant eigenvectors
yield milli-Kelvin level uncertainties. Given a sufficiently detailed description of the sky,
our methodology can be applied to any particular experiment with a suitably characterized beam
for the purpose of generating accurate beam-weighted foreground models.

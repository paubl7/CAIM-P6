The upcoming next-generation of extensive and data-intensive surveys are going to produce a vast
amount of data, which can be efficiently dealt with Machine Learning methods to explore possible
correlations within the multi-dimensional parameter space. We explored classification capabilities
of Convolution Neural Networks (CNN) to identify galaxy Cluster Members (CLMs), by using Hubble
Space Telescope images of 15 galaxy clusters at redshift 0.19<z<0.60, observed as part of the CLASH
and Hubble Frontier-Field programs. We used extensive spectroscopic information, based on the
CLASH-VLT VIMOS program combined with MUSE observations, to define a Knowledge Base. We performed
various tests to quantify how well the CNN can identify CLMs by exploiting imaging information only.
We investigated the CNN capability to predict memberships outside the training coverage, in particular,
to identify CLMs at the faint end of the magnitude distributions. We find that the CNNs achieve a purity-completeness
rate of 90%, showing a stable behaviour across the luminosity and colour of galaxies, and a remarkable
generalisation with respect to cluster redshifts. We concluded that, if extensive spectroscopic
information is available as training base, the proposed approach is a valid alternative to the catalogue-based
methods. This approach has the advantage of avoiding photometric measurements, which are challenging
and time-consuming in crowded fields. As byproduct, we identified 372 CLMs, with mag(F814)<25,
to complete the sample of 812 spectroscopic members in the four galaxy clusters RX J2248-4431, MACS
J0416-2403, MACS J1206-0847, MACS J1149+2223. When applied to the data that are expected to become
available from forthcoming surveys, this technique will be an efficient tool for a variety of studies
requiring CLMs selection, such as galaxy number densities, luminosity functions and mass reconstruction.

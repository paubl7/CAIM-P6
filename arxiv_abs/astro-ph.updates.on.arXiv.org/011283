Galaxy clustering is a standard cosmological probe that is commonly analysed through two-point
statistics. In observations, the estimation of the two-point correlation function crucially
relies on counting pairs in a random catalogue. The latter contains a large number of randomly distributed
points, which accounts for the survey window function. Random pair counts can also be advantageously
used for modelling the window function in the observed power spectrum. Since pair counting scales
as $\mathcal{O}(N^2)$, where $N$ is the number of points, the computational time to measure random
pair counts can be very expensive for large surveys. In this work, we present an alternative approach
for estimating those counts that does not rely on the use of a random catalogue. We derived an analytical
expression for the anisotropic random-random pair counts that accounts for the galaxy radial distance
distribution, survey geometry, and possible galaxy weights. Considering the cases of the VIPERS
and SDSS-BOSS redshift surveys, we find that the analytical calculation is in excellent agreement
with the pair counts obtained from random catalogues. The main advantage of this approach is that
the primary calculation only takes a few minutes on a single CPU and it does not depend on the number
of random points. Furthermore, it allows for an accuracy on the monopole equivalent to what we would
otherwise obtain when using a random catalogue with about 1500 times more points than in the data
at hand. We also describe and test an approximate expression for data-random pair counts that is
less accurate than for random-random counts, but still provides subpercent accuracy on the monopole.
The presented formalism should be very useful in accounting for the window function in next-generation
surveys, which will necessitate accurate two-point window function estimates over huge observed
cosmological volumes.

The infrared signature of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are present in many protostellar
disks and these speciesare thought to play an important role in heating of the gas in the photosphere.
We aim to consider PAH cluster formation as one possible cause for non-detections of PAH features
in protoplanetary disks. We test the necessary conditions for cluster formation and cluster dissociation
by stellar optical and FUV photons in protoplanetarydisks using a Herbig Ae/Be and a T Tauri star
disk model. We perform Monte-Carlo (MC) and statistical calculations to determine dissociation
rates for coronene, circumcoronene and circumcoronene clusters with sizes between 2 and 200 cluster
members. By applying general disk models to our Herbig Ae/Be and T Tauri star model, we estimate the
formation rate of PAH dimers and compare these with the dissociation rates. We show that the formation
of PAH dimers can take place in the inner 100 AU of protoplanetary disks in sub-photospheric layers.
Dimer formation takes seconds to years allowing them to grow beyond dimer size in a short time. We
further demonstrate that PAH cluster increase their stability while they grow if they are located
beyond a critical distance that depends on stellar properties and PAH species. The comparison with
the local vertical mixing time scale allows a determination of the minimum cluster size necessaryfor
survival of PAH clusters. Considering the PAH cluster formation sites, cluster survival in the
photosphere of the inner disk of Herbig stars isunlikely because of the high UV radiation. For the
T Tauri stars, survival of coronene, circumcoronene and circumcircumcoronene clusters is possible
and cluster formation should be considered as one possible explanation for low PAH detection rates
in T Tauri star disks.

Context. Intermediate- to high-mass stars are the least numerous types of stars and they are less
well understood than their more numerous low-mass counterparts in terms of their internal physical
processes. Modelling the photometric variability of a large sample of main-sequence intermediate-
to high-mass stars in eclipsing binary systems will help to improve the models for such stars. Aims.
Our goal is to compose a homogeneously compiled sample of main-sequence intermediate- to high-mass
OBA-type dwarfs in eclipsing binary systems from TESS photometry. We search for binaries with and
without pulsations and determine their approximate ephemerides. Methods. Our selection starts
from a catalogue of dwarfs with colours corresponding to those of OBA-type dwarfs in the TESS Input
Catalog. We develop a new automated method aimed at detecting eclipsing binaries in the presence
of strong pulsational and/or rotational signal relative to the eclipse depths and apply it to publicly
available 30-min cadence TESS light curves. Results. Using targets with TESS magnitudes below
15 and cuts in the 2MASS magnitude bands of $J - H < 0.045$ and $J - K < 0.06$ as most stringent criteria,
we arrive at a total of 189 981 intermediate- to high-mass candidates, 91193 of which have light curves
from at least one of two data reduction pipelines. The eclipsing binary detection and subsequent
manual check for false positives resulted in 3155 unique OBA-type eclipsing binary candidates.
Conclusions. Our sample of eclipsing binary stars in the intermediate- to high-mass regime allows
for future binary (and asteroseismic) modelling with the aim to better understand the internal
physical processes in this hot part of the main sequence.

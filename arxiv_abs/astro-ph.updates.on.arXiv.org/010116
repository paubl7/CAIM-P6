Deuterium (D) is one of the light elements created in the big bang. As the Galaxy evolves, the D/H abundance
in the interstellar medium (ISM) decreases from its primordial value due to "astration". However,
the observed gas-phase D/H abundances of some interstellar sightlines are substantially lower
than the expected reduction by astration alone. The missing D could have been depleted onto polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) molecules which are ubiquitous and abundant in interstellar regions.
To quantitatively explore the hypothesis of PAHs as a possible reservoir of interstellar D, we compute
quantum-chemically the infrared vibrational spectra of mono-deuterated PAHs (and their cations)
of various sizes. We find that, as expected, when H in PAHs is replaced by D, the C-H stretching and
bending modes at 3.3, 8.6 and 11.3 $\mu$m respectively shift to longer wavelengths at $\sim$4.4,
11.4 and 15.4 $\mu$m by a factor of $\sim$$\sqrt{13/7}$, the difference in reduced mass between
the C-H and C-D oscillators. We derive from the computed spectra the mean intrinsic strengths of
the 3.3 $\mu$m C-H stretch and 4.4 $\mu$m C--D stretch to be $\langle A_{3.3} \rangle \sim 13.4$ km/mol
and $\langle A_{4.4} \rangle \sim 7.4$ km/mol for neutral deuterated PAHs which would dominate
the interstellar 3.3 and 4.4 $\mu$m emission. By comparing the computationally-derived mean ratio
of $\langle A_{4.4}/A_{3.3} \rangle \sim 0.56$ for neutral PAHs with the mean ratio of the observed
intensities of $\langle (I_{4.4}/I_{3.3})_{\rm obs} \rangle \sim 0.019$, we estimate the degree
of deuteration (i.e., the fraction of peripheral atoms attached to C in the form of D) to be ~2.4\%,
corresponding to a D-enrichment of a factor of ~1200 with respect to the interstellar D/H abundance.

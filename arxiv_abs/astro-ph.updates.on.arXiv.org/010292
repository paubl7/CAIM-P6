Physically unassociated background or foreground objects seen towards submillimetre sources
are potential contaminants of both the studies of young stellar objects embedded in Galactic dust
clumps and multiwavelength counterparts of submillimetre galaxies (SMGs). We employed the near-infrared
and mid-infrared data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) and the submillimetre
data from the Planck satellite, and uncovered a source, namely WISE J044232.92+322734.9, whose
WISE infrared colours suggest that it is a star-forming galaxy (SFG), and which is seen in projection
towards the Planck-detected dust clump PGCC G169.20-8.96. We used the MAGPHYS+photo-$z$ spectral
energy distribution code to derive the photometric redshift and physical properties of J044232.92.
The redshift was derived to be $z_{\rm phot}=1.132^{+0.280}_{-0.165}$, while, for example, the
stellar mass, IR (8-1 000 $\mu$m) luminosity, and star formation rate were derived to be $M_{\star}=4.6^{+4.7}_{-2.5}\times10^{11}$
M$_{\odot}$, $L_{\rm IR}=2.8^{+5.7}_{-1.5}\times10^{12}$ L$_{\odot}$, and ${\rm SFR}=191^{+580}_{-146}$
${\rm M}_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$. The derived value of $L_{\rm IR}$ suggests that J044232.92 could
be an ultraluminous infrared galaxy, and we found that it is consistent with a main sequence SFG at
a redshift of 1.132. Moreover, the estimated physical properties of J044232.92 are comparable
to those of SMGs. Further observations, in particular high-resolution (sub-)millimetre and radio
continuum imaging, are needed to better constrain the redshift and physical properties of J044232.92
and to see if the source really is a galaxy seen through a Galactic dust clump, in particular an SMG
population member at $z\sim1.1$.

We study the potential of Bayesian Neural Networks (BNNs) to detect new physics in the dark matter
power spectrum, concentrating here on evolving dark energy and modifications to General Relativity.
After introducing a new technique to quantify classification uncertainty in BNNs, we train two
BNNs on mock matter power spectra produced using the publicly available code $\tt{ReACT}$ in the
$k$-range $\left(0.01 - 2.5\right) \, h \mathrm{Mpc}^{-1} $ and redshift bins $\left(0.1,0.478,0.783,1.5\right)$
with Euclid-like noise. The first network classifies spectra into five labels including $\Lambda$CDM,
$f(R)$, $w$CDM, Dvali-Gabadaze-Porrati (DGP) gravity and a "random" class whereas the second
is trained to distinguish $\Lambda$CDM from non-$\Lambda$CDM. Both networks achieve a comparable
training, validation and test accuracy of $\sim 95\%$. Each network is also capable of detecting
deviations from $\Lambda$CDM that were not included in the training set, demonstrated with spectra
generated using the growth-index $\gamma$. We then quantify the constraining power of each network
by computing the smallest deviation from $\Lambda$CDM such that the noise-averaged non-$\Lambda$CDM
classification probability is at least $2\sigma$, finding these bounds to be $f_{R0} \lesssim
10^{-7}$, $\Omega_{rc} \lesssim 10^{-2} $, $-1.05 \lesssim w_0 \lesssim 0.95 $, $-0.2 \lesssim
w_a \lesssim 0.2 $, $0.52 \lesssim \gamma \lesssim 0.59 $. The bounds on $f(R)$ can be improved by
training a specialist network to distinguish solely between $\Lambda$CDM and $f(R)$ power spectra
which can detect a non-zero $f_{R0}$ at $\mathcal{O}\left(10^{-8}\right)$ with a confidence
$>2\sigma$. We expect that further developments, such as the inclusion of smaller length scales
or additional extensions to $\Lambda$CDM, will only improve the potential of BNNs to detect new
physics using cosmological datasets.

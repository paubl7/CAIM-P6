We present the first statistical analysis of kinematically-resolved, spatially-extended Ly$\alpha$
emission around $z = 2-3$ galaxies in the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS) using the Keck Cosmic
Web Imager (KCWI). Our sample of 59 star-forming galaxies ($z_\mathrm{med} = 2.29$) comprises
the subset with typical KCWI integration times of ~5 hours and with existing imaging data from the
Hubble Space Telescope and/or adaptive optics-assisted integral field spectroscopy. The high
resolution images were used to evaluate the azimuthal dependence of the diffuse Ly$\alpha$ emission
with respect to the stellar continuum within projected galactocentric distances of $\lesssim
30$ proper kpc. We introduce cylindrically-projected 2D spectra (CP2D) that map the averaged Ly$\alpha$
spectral profile over a specified range of azimuthal angle, as a function of impact parameter around
galaxies. The averaged CP2D spectrum of all galaxies shows clear signatures of Ly$\alpha$ resonant
scattering by outflowing gas. We stacked the CP2D spectra of individual galaxies over ranges of
azimuthal angle with respect to their major axes. The extended Ly$\alpha$ emission along the galaxy
principal axes are statistically indistinguishable, with residual asymmetry of $\le$ 2% ($\sim
2 \sigma$) of the integrated Ly$\alpha$ emission. The symmetry implies that the Ly$\alpha$ scattering
medium is dominated by outflows in all directions within 30 kpc. Meanwhile, we find that the blueshifted
component of Ly$\alpha$ emission is marginally stronger along galaxy minor axes for galaxies with
relatively weak Ly$\alpha$ emission. We speculate that this weak directional dependence of Ly$\alpha$
emission becomes discernible only when the Ly$\alpha$ escape fraction is low. These discoveries
highlight the need for similar analyses in simulations with Ly$\alpha$ radiative transfer modeling.

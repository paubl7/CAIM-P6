Early Dark Energy (EDE) contributing a fraction $f_{\rm EDE}(z_c)\sim 10 \%$ of the energy density
of the universe around $z_c\simeq 3500$ and diluting as or faster than radiation afterwards, can
provide a resolution to the Hubble tension, the $\sim 5\sigma$ discrepancy between the $H_0$ value
derived from early- and late-universe observations within $\Lambda$CDM. However, it has been
pointed out that Large-Scale Structure (LSS) data, which are in $\sim3\sigma$ tension with $\Lambda$CDM
and EDE cosmologies, might alter these conclusions. We reassess the viability of the EDE against
a host of high- and low-redshift measurements, by combining LSS observations from recent weak lensing
(WL) surveys with CMB, Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO), growth function (FS) and Supernova Ia
(SNIa) data. Introducing a model whose only parameter is $f_{\rm EDE}(z_c)$, we report a $\sim 2\sigma$
preference for non-zero $f_{\rm EDE}(z_c)$ from Planck data alone and the tension with SH0ES is
reduced below $2\sigma$. Adding BAO, FS and SNIa does not affect this result, while the inclusion
of a prior on $H_0$ from SH0ES increase the preference for non-zero EDE to $\sim3.6\sigma$. After
checking the EDE non-linear matter power spectrum predicted by standard semi-analytical algorithms
via a set of $N$-body simulations, we show that current WL data do not rule out EDE. We also caution
against the interpretation of constraints obtained from combining statistically inconsistent
data sets within the $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. In light of the CMB lensing anomalies, we show that
the lensing-marginalized CMB data also favor non-zero $f_{\rm EDE}(z_c)$ at $\sim2\sigma$, predicts
$H_0$ in $1.4\sigma$ agreement with SH0ES and $S_8$ in $1.5\sigma$ ($0.8\sigma$) agreement with
KV (DES) data. Alternatively, we discuss promising extensions of the EDE cosmology that could allow
to fully restore cosmological concordance.

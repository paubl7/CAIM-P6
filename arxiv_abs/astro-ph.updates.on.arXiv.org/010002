Recent observational studies aiming to quantify the molecular cloud lifecycle require the use
of known 'reference time-scales' to turn the relative durations of different phases of the star
formation process into absolute time-scales. We previously constrained the characteristic emission
time-scales of different star formation rate (SFR) tracers, as a function of the SFR surface density
and metallicity. However, we omitted the effects of dust extinction. Here, we extend our suite of
SFR tracer emission time-scales by accounting for extinction, using synthetic emission maps of
a high-resolution hydrodynamical simulation of an isolated, Milky-Way-like disc galaxy. The
stellar feedback included in the simulation is inefficient compared to observations, implying
that it represents a limiting case in which the duration of embedded star formation (and the corresponding
effect of extinction) is overestimated. Across our experiments, we find that extinction mostly
decreases the SFR tracer emission time-scale, changing the time-scales by factors of 0.04-1.74,
depending on the gas column density. UV filters are more strongly affected than H$\alpha$ filters.
We provide the limiting correction factors as a function of the gas column density and flux sensitivity
limit for a wide variety of SFR tracers. Applying these factors to observational characterisations
of the molecular cloud lifecycle produces changes that broadly fall within the quoted uncertainties,
except at high kpc-scale gas surface densities ($\Sigma_{\rm g}\gtrsim20~{\mathrm{M_{\odot}\,pc^{-2}}}$).
Under those conditions, correcting for extinction may decrease the measured molecular cloud lifetimes
and feedback time-scales, which further strengthens previous conclusions that molecular clouds
live for a dynamical time and are dispersed by early, pre-supernova feedback.

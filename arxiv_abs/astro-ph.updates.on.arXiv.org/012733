Space-based transit missions such as Kepler and TESS have demonstrated that planets are ubiquitous.
However, the success of these missions heavily depends on ground-based radial velocity (RV) surveys,
which combined with transit photometry can yield bulk densities and orbital properties. While
most Kepler host stars are too faint for detailed follow-up observations, TESS is detecting planets
orbiting nearby bright stars that are more amenable to RV characterization. Here we introduce the
TESS-Keck Survey (TKS), an RV program using ~100 nights on Keck/HIRES to study exoplanets identified
by TESS. The primary survey aims are investigating the link between stellar properties and the compositions
of small planets; studying how the diversity of system architectures depends on dynamical configurations
or planet multiplicity; identifying prime candidates for atmospheric studies with JWST; and understanding
the role of stellar evolution in shaping planetary systems. We present a fully-automated target
selection algorithm, which yielded 103 planets in 86 systems for the final TKS sample. Most TKS hosts
are inactive, solar-like, main-sequence stars (4500 K < Teff < 6000 K) at a wide range of metallicities.
The selected TKS sample contains 71 small planets (Rp < 4 Re), 11 systems with multiple transiting
candidates, 6 sub-day period planets and 3 planets that are in or near the habitable zone of their
host star. The target selection described here will facilitate the comparison of measured planet
masses, densities, and eccentricities to predictions from planet population models. Our target
selection software is publicly available (at https://github.com/ashleychontos/sort-a-survey)
and can be adapted for any survey which requires a balance of multiple science interests within a
given telescope allocation.

The stellar mass-to-light ratio gradient in SDSS $r-$band $\nabla (M_*/L_r)$ of a galaxy depends
on its mass assembly history, which is imprinted in its morphology and gradients of age, metallicity,
and stellar initial mass function (IMF). Taking a MaNGA sample of 2051 galaxies with stellar masses
ranging from $10^9$ to $10^{12}M_\odot$ released in SDSS DR15, we focus on face-on galaxies, without
merger and bar signatures, and investigate the dependence of the 2D $\nabla (M_*/L_r)$ on other
galaxy properties, including $M_*/L_r$-colour relationships by assuming a fixed Salpeter IMF
as the mass normalization reference. The median gradient is $\nabla M_*/L_r\sim -0.1$ (i.e., the
$M_*/L_r$ is larger at the centre) for massive galaxies, becomes flat around $M_*\sim 10^{10} M_{\odot}$
and change sign to $\nabla M_*/L_r\sim 0.1$ at the lowest masses. The $M_*/L_r$ inside a half light
radius increases with increasing galaxy stellar mass; in each mass bin, early-type galaxies have
the highest value, while pure-disk late-type galaxies have the smallest. Correlation analyses
suggest that the mass-weighted stellar age is the dominant parameter influencing the $M_*/L_r$
profile, since a luminosity-weighted age is easily affected by star formation when the specific
star formation rate (sSFR) inside the half light radius is higher than $10^{-3} {\rm Gyr}^{-1}$.
With increased sSFR gradient, one can obtain a steeper negative $\nabla (M_*/L_r)$. The scatter
in the slopes of $M_*/L$-colour relations increases with increasing sSFR, for example, the slope
for post-starburst galaxies can be flattened to $0.45$ from the global value $0.87$ in the $M_*/L$
vs. $g-r$ diagram. Hence converting galaxy colours to $M_*/L$ should be done carefully, especially
for those galaxies with young luminosity-weighted stellar ages, which can have quite different
star formation histories.

We present results of MUSE-ALMA Halos, an ongoing study of the Circumgalactic Medium (CGM) of galaxies
($z \leq$ 1.4). Using multi-phase observations we probe the neutral, ionised and molecular gas
in a sub-sample containing six absorbers and nine associated galaxies in the redshift range $z \sim
0.3-0.75$. Here, we give an in-depth analysis of the newly CO-detected galaxy Q2131-G1 ($z=0.42974$),
while providing stringent mass and depletion time limits for the non-detected galaxies. Q2131-G1
is associated with an absorber with column densities of $\textrm{log}(N_\textrm{HI}/\textrm{cm}^{-2})
\sim 19.5$ and $\textrm{log}(N_{\textrm{H}_2}/\textrm{cm}^{-2}) \sim 16.5$, has a star formation
rate of $\textrm{SFR} = 2.00 \pm 0.20 \; \textrm{M}_{\odot} \textrm{yr}^{-1}$, a dark matter fraction
of $f_\textrm{DM}(r_{1/2}) = 0.24 - 0.54$ and a molecular gas mass of $M_\textrm{mol} = 3.52 ^{+3.95}_{-0.31}
\times 10^9 \; \textrm{M}_{\odot}$ resulting in a depletion time of $\tau_\textrm{dep} < 4.15
\; \textrm{Gyr}$. Kinematic modelling of both the CO (3--2) and [OIII] $\lambda 5008$ emission
lines of Q2131-G1 shows that the molecular and ionised gas phases are well aligned directionally
and that the maximum rotation velocities closely match. These two gas phases within the disk are
strongly coupled. The metallicity, kinematics and orientation of the atomic and molecular gas
traced by a two-component absorption feature is consistent with being part of the extended rotating
disk with a well-separated additional component associated with infalling gas. Compared to emission-selected
samples, we find that HI-selected galaxies have high molecular gas masses given their low star formation
rate. We consequently derive high depletion times for these objects.

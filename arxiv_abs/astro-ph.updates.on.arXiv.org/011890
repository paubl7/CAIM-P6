Context. The large-scale mass distribution around dark matter haloes hosting galaxy clusters
provides sensitive cosmological information. Aims. In this work, we make use of a large photometric
galaxy cluster sample, constructed from the public Third Data Release of the Kilo-Degree Survey,
and the corresponding shear signal, to assess cluster masses and test the concordance ${\Lambda}$-cold
dark matter (${\Lambda}$CDM) model. In particular, we study the weak gravitational lensing effects
on scales beyond the cluster virial radius, where the signal is dominated by correlated and uncorrelated
matter density distributions along the line-of-sight. The analysed catalogue consists of 6962
galaxy clusters, in the redshift range $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.6$ and with signal-to-noise ratio larger
than 3.5. Methods. We perform a full Bayesian analysis to model the stacked shear profiles of these
clusters. The adopted likelihood function considers both the small-scale 1-halo term, used primarily
to constrain the cluster structural properties, and the 2-halo term, that can be used to constrain
cosmological parameters. Results. We find that the adopted modelling is successful to assess both
the cluster masses and the total matter density parameter, ${\Omega}_M$, when fitting shear profiles
up to the largest available scales of 35 Mpc/h. Moreover, our results provide a strong observational
evidence of the 2-halo signal in the stacked gravitational lensing of galaxy clusters, further
demonstrating the reliability of this probe for cosmological studies. The main result of this work
is a robust constraint on ${\Omega}_M$, assuming a flat ${\Lambda}$CDM cosmology. We get ${\Omega}_M
= 0.29 \pm 0.02$, estimated from the full posterior probability distribution, consistent with
the estimates from cosmic microwave background experiments.

The goal of this paper is to study the smallest brightening events observed in the EUV quiet Sun. We
use commissioning data taken by the EUI instrument onboard the recently launched Solar Orbiter
mission. On 2020 May 30, EUI was situated at 0.556AU from the Sun. Its HRIEUV telescope 17.4nm passband
reached an exceptionally high two-pixel spatial resolution of 400km. The size and duration of small-scale
structures is determined in the HRIEUV data, while their height is estimated from triangulation
with the simultaneous SDO/AIA data. This is the first stereoscopy of small scale brightenings at
high resolution. We observed small localised brightenings ("campfires") in a quiet Sun region
with lengthscales between 400km and 4000km and durations between 10 and 200s. The smallest and weakest
of these HRIEUV brightenings have not been observed before. Simultaneous HRILYA observations
do not show localised brightening events, but the locations of the HRIEUV events correspond clearly
to the chromospheric network. Comparison with simultaneous AIA images shows that most events can
also be identified in the 17.1nm, 19.3nm, 21.1nm, and 30.4nm passbands of AIA, although they appear
weaker and blurred. DEM analysis indicates coronal temperatures peaking at log(T)~6.1-6.15.
We determined the height of a few campfires, which is between 1000 and 5000km above the photosphere.
We conclude that "campfires" are mostly coronal in nature and are rooted in the magnetic flux concentrations
of the chromospheric network. We interpret these events as a new extension to the flare/microflare/nanoflare
family. Given their low height, the EUI "campfires" could be a new element of the fine structure of
the transition region/low corona: apexes of small-scale loops that are internally heated to coronal
temperatures.

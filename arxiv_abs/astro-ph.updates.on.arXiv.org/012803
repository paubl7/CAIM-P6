We present the Empirical Dust Attenuation (EDA) framework -- a flexible prescription for assigning
realistic dust attenuation to simulated galaxies based on their physical properties. We use the
EDA to forward model synthetic observations for three state-of-the-art large-scale cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations: SIMBA, IllustrisTNG, and EAGLE. We then compare the optical and UV
color-magnitude relations, $(g-r) - M_r$ and $(FUV-NUV)-M_r$, of the simulations to a $M_r < -20$
and UV complete SDSS galaxy sample using likelihood-free inference. Without dust, none of the simulations
match observations, as expected. With the EDA, however, we can reproduce the observed color-magnitude
with all three simulations. Furthermore, the attenuation curves predicted by our dust prescription
are in good agreement with the observed attenuation-slope relations and attenuation curves of
star-forming galaxies. However, the EDA does not predict star-forming galaxies with low $A_V$
since simulated star-forming galaxies are intrinsically much brighter than observations. Additionally,
the EDA provides, for the first time, predictions on the attenuation curves of quiescent galaxies,
which are challenging to measure observationally. Simulated quiescent galaxies require shallower
attenuation curves with lower amplitude than star-forming galaxies. The EDA, combined with forward
modeling, provides an effective approach for shedding light on dust in galaxies and probing hydrodynamical
simulations. This work also illustrates a major limitation in comparing galaxy formation models:
by adjusting dust attenuation, simulations that predict significantly different galaxy populations
can reproduce the same UV and optical observations.

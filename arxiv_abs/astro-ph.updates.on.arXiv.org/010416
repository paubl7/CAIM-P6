The nonthermal source abundances of elements play a crucial role in the understanding of cosmic
ray phenomena from a few GeV up to several tens of EeV. We present a first systematic approach to describe
the change of the abundances from the thermal to the nonthermal state via diffusive shock acceleration
by a temporally evolving shock. We consider hereby not only ionization states of elements contained
in the ambient gas, which we allow to be time dependent due to shock heating, but also elements condensed
on solid, charged dust grains which can be injected into the acceleration process as well. Our generic
parametrized model is then applied to the case of particle acceleration by supernova remnants in
various ISM phases, for which we use state-of-the-art computation packages to calculate the ionization
states of all elements. The resulting predictions for low energy cosmic ray source abundances are
compared with the data obtained by various experiments. We obtain excellent agreement for shocks
in warm ionized ISM environments, which include HII regions, if dust grains are injected into the
diffusive shock acceleration process with a much higher efficiency than ions. Less dependence
of the fit quality is found on the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. In contrast, for neutral ISM environments,
assuming that there are shocks in the weak ionized component, or for the hot ionized medium we obtain
generally inferior fits. Hereby, the main reason for this difference does not seem to be the density
or temperature of the ISM environments, but their gas-to-dust ratio. We briefly discuss potential
consequences for the understanding of the composition around the second knee or the cosmic ray spectrum,
or for the viability of explaining ultra-high energy cosmic rays with a dominant contribution by
radio galaxies.

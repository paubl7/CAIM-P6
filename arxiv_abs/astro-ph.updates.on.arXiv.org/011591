We investigate self-gravitating equilibria of halos constituted by dark matter (DM) non-minimally
coupled to gravity. In particular, we consider a theoretically motivated non-minimal coupling
which may arise when the averaging/coherence length $L$ associated to the fluid description of
the DM collective behavior is comparable to the local curvature scale. In the Newtonian limit, such
a non-minimal coupling amounts to a modification of the Poisson equation by a term $L^2\,\nabla^2\rho$
proportional to the Laplacian of the DM density $\rho$ itself. We further adopt a general power-law
equation of state $p\propto \rho^{\Gamma}\, r^\alpha$ relating the DM dynamical pressure $p$
to density $\rho$ and radius $r$, as expected by phase-space density stratification during the
gravitational assembly of halos in a cosmological context. We confirm previous findings that,
in absence of the non-minimal coupling, the resulting density $\rho(r)$ features a steep central
cusp and an overall shape mirroring the outcomes of $N-$body simulations in the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology, as described by the classic NFW or Einasto profiles. Most importantly, we find that the
non-minimal coupling causes the density distribution to develop an inner core and a shape closely
following, out to several core scale radii, the Burkert profile. In fact, we highlight that the resulting
mass distributions can fit, with an accuracy comparable to the Burkert's one, the co-added rotation
curves of dwarf, DM-dominated galaxies. Finally, we show that non-minimally coupled DM halos are
consistent with the observed scaling relation between the core radius $r_0$ and core density $\rho_0$,
in terms of an universal core surface density $\rho_0\times r_0$ among different galaxies.

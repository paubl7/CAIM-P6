Upcoming galaxy surveys and 21-cm experiments targeting high redshifts $z\gtrsim 6$ are highly
complementary probes of galaxy formation and reionization. However, in order to expedite the large
volume simulations relevant for 21-cm observations, many models of galaxies within reionization
codes are entirely subgrid and/or rely on halo abundances only. In this work, we explore the extent
to which resolving and modeling individual galaxy formation histories affects predictions both
for the galaxy populations accessible to upcoming surveys and the signatures of reionization accessible
to upcoming 21-cm experiments. We find that a common approach, in which galaxy luminosity is assumed
to be a function of halo mass only, is biased with respect to models in which galaxy properties are
evolved through time via semi-analytic modeling and thus reflective of the diversity of assembly
histories that naturally arise in $N$-body simulations. The diversity of galaxy formation histories
also results in scenarios in which the brightest galaxies do \textit{not} always reside in the centers
of large ionized regions, as there are often relatively low-mass halos undergoing dramatic, but
short-term, growth. This has clear implications for attempts to detect or validate the 21-cm background
via cross correlation. Finally, we show that a hybrid approach -- in which only halos hosting galaxies
bright enough to be detected in surveys are modeled in detail, with the rest modeled as an unresolved
field of halos with abundance related to large-scale overdensity -- is a viable way to generate large-volume
`simulations` well-suited to wide-area surveys and current-generation 21-cm experiments targeting
relatively large $k \lesssim 1 \ h \ \text{Mpc}^{-1}$ scales.

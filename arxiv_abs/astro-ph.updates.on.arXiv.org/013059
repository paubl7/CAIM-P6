Planet-disc interactions build up local pressure maxima that may halt the radial drift of protoplanetary
dust, and pile it up in rings and crescents. ALMA observations of the HD135344B disc revealed two
rings in the thermal continuum stemming from ~mm-sized dust. At higher frequencies the inner ring
is brighter relative to the outer ring, which is also shaped as a crescent rather than a full ring.
In near-IR scattered light images, the disc is modulated by a 2-armed grand-design spiral originating
inside the ALMA inner ring. Such structures may be induced by a massive companion evacuating the
central cavity, and by a giant planet in the gap separating both rings, that channels the accretion
of small dust and gas through its filamentary wakes while stopping the larger dust from crossing
the gap. Here we present ALMA observations in the J=(2-1)CO isotopologue lines and in the adjacent
continuum, with up to 12km baselines. Angular resolutions of 0.03" reveal the tentative detection
of a filament connecting both rings, and which coincides with a local discontinuity in the pitch
angle of the IR spiral, proposed previously as the location of the protoplanet driving this spiral.
Line diagnostics suggest that turbulence, or superposed velocity components, is particularly
strong in the spirals. The 12CO(2-1) 3-D rotation curve points at stellocentric accretion at radii
within the inner dust ring, with a radial velocity of up to ~6%+-0.5% Keplerian, which corresponds
to an excessively large accretion rate of ~2E-6M_sun/yr if all of the CO layer follows the 12CO(2-1)
kinematics. This suggests that only the surface layers of the disc are undergoing accretion, and
that the line broadening is due to superposed laminar flows.

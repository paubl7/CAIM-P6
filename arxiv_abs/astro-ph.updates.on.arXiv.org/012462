Eclipsing systems are essential objects for understanding the properties of stars and stellar
systems. Eclipsing systems with pulsating components are furthermore advantageous because they
provide accurate constraints on the component properties, as well as a complementary method for
pulsation mode determination, crucial for precise asteroseismology. The outcome of space missions
aiming at delivering high-accuracy light curves for many thousands of stars in search of planetary
systems has also generated new insights in the field of variable stars and revived the interest of
binary systems in general. The detection of eclipsing systems with pulsating components has particularly
benefitted from this, and progress in this field is growing fast. In this review, we showcase some
of the recent results obtained from studies of eclipsing systems with pulsating components based
on data acquired by the space missions {\it Kepler} or TESS. We consider different system configurations
including semi-detached eclipsing binaries in (near-)circular orbits, a (near-)circular and
non-synchronized eclipsing binary with a chemically peculiar component, eclipsing binaries
showing the heartbeat phenomenon, as well as detached, eccentric double-lined systems. All display
one or more pulsating component(s). Among the great variety of known classes of pulsating stars,
we discuss unevolved or slightly evolved pulsators of spectral type B, A or F and red giants with solar-like
oscillations. Some systems exhibit additional phenomena such as tidal effects, angular momentum
transfer, (occasional) mass transfer between the components and/or magnetic activity. How these
phenomena and the orbital changes affect the different types of pulsations excited in one or more
components, offers a new window of opportunity to better understand the physics of pulsations.

We present a study of the 21-cm signal bispectrum (which quantifies the non-Gaussianity in the signal)
from the Cosmic Dawn (CD). For our analysis, we have simulated the 21-cm signal using radiative transfer
code GRIZZLY, while considering two types of sources (mini-QSOs and HMXBs) for Ly$\alpha$ coupling
and the X-ray heating of the IGM. Using this simulated signal, we have, for the first time, estimated
the CD 21-cm bispectra for all unique $k$-triangles and for a range of $k$ modes. We observe that the
redshift evolution of the bispectra magnitude and sign follow a generic trend for both source models.
However, the redshifts at which the bispectra magnitude reach their maximum and minimum values
and show their sign reversal depends on the source model. When the Ly$\alpha$ coupling and the X-ray
heating of the IGM occur simultaneously, we observe two consecutive sign reversals in the bispectra
for small $k$-triangles (irrespective of the source models). One arising at the beginning of the
IGM heating and the other at the end of Ly$\alpha$ coupling saturation. This feature can be used in
principle to constrain the CD history and/or to identify the specific CD scenarios. We also quantify
the impact of the spin temperature ($T_{\rm S}$) fluctuations on the bispectra. We find that $T_{\rm
S}$ fluctuations have maximum impact on the bispectra magnitude for small $k$-triangles and at
the stage when Ly$\alpha$ coupling reaches saturation. Furthermore, we are also the first to quantify
the impact of redshift space distortions (RSD), on the CD bispectra. We find that the impact of RSD
on the CD 21-cm bispectra is significant ($> 20\%$) and the level depends on the stages of the CD and
the $k$-triangles for which the bispectra are being estimated.

Ultra-fast outflows (UFOs) play a key role in the AGN feedback mechanism. It is therefore important
to fully characterise their location and energetics. We study the UFO in the latest XMM-Newton archival
observation of the NLSy1 galaxy PG 1448+273 by means of a novel modelling tool, that is, the Wind in
the Ionised Nuclear Environment model (WINE). Our detection of the UFO in PG 1448+273 is very robust.
The outflowing material is highly ionised, $\log\xi = 5.53_{-0.05}^{+0.04}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm,
has a large column density, $N_\mathrm{H} = 4.5_{-1.1}^{+0.8} \times 10^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$, is ejected
with a maximum velocity $v_0 = 0.24^{+0.08}_{-0.06}\,c$ (90% c.l. errors), and attains an average
velocity $v_\mathrm{avg} = 0.152\,c$. WINE remarkably succeeds in constraining a launching radius
of $r_0=77_{-19}^{+31} \, r_\mathrm{S}$ from the black hole. We also derive a lower limit on both
the opening angle of the wind ($\theta > 72^{\circ}$) and the covering factor ($C_\mathrm{f} > 0.69$).
We find a mass outflow rate $\dot{M}_\mathrm{out}=0.65^{+0.44}_{-0.33}\,M_\odot \mathrm{yr}^{-1}
= 2.0^{+1.3}_{-1.0}\, \dot{M}_\mathrm{acc}$ and a large instantaneous outflow kinetic power
$\dot{E}_\mathrm{out}=4.4^{+4.4}_{-3.6} \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ = 24% $L_\mathrm{bol}$
= 18% $L_\mathrm{Edd}$ ($1 \sigma$ errors). We find that a major error contribution on the energetics
is due to $r_0$, stressing the importance of an accurate determination through a proper spectral
modelling, as done with WINE. Using 20 Swift (UVOT and XRT) observations and the simultaneous OM
data from XMM-Newton, we also find that $\alpha_\mathrm{ox}$ undergoes large variations, with
a maximum excursion of $\Delta\alpha_\mathrm{ox} =-0.7$, after the UFO is detected, leading to
a remarkable X-ray weakness. This may point towards a starving of the inner accretion disk due to
the removal of matter through the wind.

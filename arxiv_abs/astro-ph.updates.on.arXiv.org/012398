Pressure maxima are regions in protoplanetary disks where pebbles can be trapped because of the
local absence of pressure gradient. These regions could be ideal places to form planetesimals or
to isolate isotopic reservoirs. Observations of protoplanetary disks show that dusty rings structures
are common, and pressure maxima are sometime invoked as a possible explanation. In our Solar System,
pressure bumps have been suggested as a possible mechanism for separating reservoirs with different
nucleosynthetic compositions. In this letter we detail a mechanism by which pressure maxima form
just inward the snow-line in stratified disks. This mechanism does not need the presence of a planet.
Using a combination of analytical and numerical investigation we explore the range of conditions
for a pressure maximum to form inside the dead-zone and just inward the snow-line. When the vertically
averaged $\alpha$ is a decreasing function of surface density then the release of water vapor at
the snow-line lowers the sound velocity, and in turn, a pressure bump appears. This requires a constant
inflow of icy pebbles with pebbles influx to gas influx $>0.6$ for a power law disk with $1\%$ ice/gas
ratio, and $>1.8$ for a disk with ice/gas ratio $\sim 0.3\%$. If these conditions are met, then a Pressure-maximum
appears just inward the snow-line due to a process coupling the dead and active layers at the evaporation
front. The pressure bump survives as long as the icy pebble flux is high enough. The formation of the
pressure bump is triggered by the drop of sound velocity inward the snow-line, due to the release
of water vapor. This mechanism is promising for isolating early reservoirs carrying different
isotopic signatures in the Solar System and for promoting dry planetesimal formation inward the
snow-line, provided the vertically averaged description of a dead-zone is valid.

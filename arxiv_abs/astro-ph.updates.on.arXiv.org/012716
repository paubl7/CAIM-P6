Studies of the stellar and the HI gas kinematics in dwarf and Low Surface Brightness (LSB) galaxies
are essential for deriving constraints on their dark matter distribution. Moreover, a key component
to unveil in the evolution of LSBs is why some of them can be classified as superthin. We aim to investigate
the nature of the proto-typical superthin galaxy Fourcade-Figueroa (FF), to understand the role
played by the dark matter halo in forming its superthin shape and to investigate the mechanism that
explains the observed disruption in the approaching side of the galaxy. Combining new HI 21-cm observations
obtained with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope with archival data from the Australia Telescope
Compact Array we were able to obtain sensitive HI observations of the FF galaxy. These data were modeled
with a 3D tilted ring model in order to derive the rotation curve and surface brightness density of
the neutral hydrogen. We subsequently used this model, combined with a stellar profile from the
literature, to derive the radial distribution of the dark matter in the FF galaxy. For the FF galaxy
the Navarro-Frenk-White dark matter distribution provides the best fit to the observed rotation
curve. However, the differences with a pseudo-isothermal halo are small. Both models indicate
that the core of the dark matter halo is compact. Even though the FF galaxy classifies as superthin,
the gas thickness about the galactic centre exhibits a steep flaring of the gas which is in agreement
with the edge of the stellar disk. As suggested previously in the literature, the compact dark matter
halo might be the main responsible for the superthin structure of the stellar disk in FF. This idea
is strengthened through the detection of the mentioned disruption; the fact that the galaxy is disturbed
also seems to support the idea that it is not isolation that cause its superthin structure.

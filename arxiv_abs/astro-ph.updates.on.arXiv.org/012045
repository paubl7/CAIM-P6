We reconsider the widely held view that the Mannheim--Kazanas (MK) vacuum solution for a static,
spherically-symmetric system in conformal gravity (CG) predicts flat rotation curves, such as
those observed in galaxies, without the need for dark matter. The conformal equivalence of the MK
and Schwarzschild--de-Sitter (SdS) metrics, where the latter does not predict flat rotation curves,
raises concerns that the prediction in the MK frame may be a gauge artefact. This ambiguity arises
from assuming that, in each frame, test particles have fixed rest mass and follow timelike geodesics,
which are not conformally invariant. The mass of such particles must instead be generated dynamically
through interaction with a scalar field, the energy-momentum of which means that the spacetime
outside a static, spherically-symmetric matter distribution in CG is, in general, not given by
the MK vacuum solution. A unique solution does exist, however, for which the scalar field energy-momentum
vanishes and the metric retains the MK form. Nonetheless, we show that in both the Einstein and MK
frames of this solution, in which the scalar field is constant or radially-dependent, respectively,
massive particles follow timelike geodesics of the SdS metric, thereby resolving the apparent
frame dependence of physical predictions and unambiguously yielding rotation curves with no flat
region. We further find that the general form of the conformal transformation linking the Einstein
and MK frames is unique in preserving the structure of any diagonal static, spherically-symmetric
metric with a radial coefficient that is (minus) the reciprocal of its temporal one. We also comment
briefly on how our analysis resolves the long-standing uncertainty regarding gravitational lensing
in the MK metric. (Abridged)

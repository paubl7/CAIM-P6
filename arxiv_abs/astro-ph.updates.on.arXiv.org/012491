Halo assembly bias is the secondary dependence of the clustering of dark-matter haloes on their
assembly histories at fixed halo mass. This established dependence is expected to manifest itself
on the clustering of the galaxy population, a potential effect commonly known as galaxy assembly
bias. Using the IllustrisTNG300 magnetohydrodynamical simulation, we analyse the dependence
of the properties and clustering of galaxies on the shape of the specific mass accretion history
of their hosting haloes (sMAH). We first show that several halo and galaxy properties strongly correlate
with the slope of the sMAH ($\beta$) at fixed halo mass. Namely, haloes with increasingly steeper
$\beta$ increment their halo masses faster at early times, and their hosted galaxies present larger
stellar-to-halo mass ratios, lose their gas faster, reach the peak of their star formation histories
at higher redshift, and become quenched earlier. We also demonstrate that $\beta$ is more directly
connected to these key galaxy formation properties than other broadly employed halo proxies, such
as formation time. Finally, we measure the secondary dependence of galaxy clustering on $\beta$
at fixed halo mass as a function of redshift. By tracing back the evolution of individual haloes,
we show that the amplitude of the galaxy assembly bias signal for the progenitors of $z=0$ galaxies
increases with redshift, reaching a factor of 2 at $z = 1$ for haloes of $M_\mathrm{halo}=10^{11.5}-10^{12}$
$h^{-1}\mathrm{M}_\odot$. The measurement of the evolution of assembly bias along the merger
tree provides a new theoretical perspective to the study of secondary bias. Our findings, which
show a tight relationship between halo accretion and both the clustering and the observational
properties of the galaxy population, have also important implications for the generation of mock
catalogues for upcoming cosmological surveys.

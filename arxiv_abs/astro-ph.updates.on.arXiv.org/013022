We use direct numerical simulations of decaying primordial hydromagnetic turbulence with helicity
to compute the resulting gravitational wave (GW) production and its degree of circular polarization.
We find a clear dependence of the polarization of the resulting GWs on the fractional helicity of
the turbulent source and we show that driven magnetic fields produce GWs more efficiently than magnetic
fields that are initially present, leading to larger spectral amplitudes. The helicity does not
have a huge impact on the maximum spectral amplitude in any of the two types of turbulence considered.
However, the GW spectrum at wave numbers away from the peak becomes smaller for larger values of the
magnetic fractional helicity. The degree of circular polarization approaches zero at frequencies
below the peak, and reaches its maximum at the peak. At higher frequencies, it stays finite if the
magnetic field is initially present, and it approaches zero if it is driven. We predict that the spectral
peak of the GW signal can be detected by LISA if the turbulent energy density is at least $\sim\!3\%$
of the radiation energy density, and the characteristic scale is a hundredth of the horizon at the
electroweak scale. We show that the resulting GW polarization is unlikely to be detectable by the
anisotropies induced by our proper motion in the dipole response function of LISA. Such signals
can, however, be detectable by cross-correlating data from the LISA-Taiji network for turbulent
energy densities of $\sim\!5\%$, and fractional helicity of 0.5 to 1. Second-generation space-base
GW detectors, such as BBO and DECIGO, would allow for the detection of a larger range of the GW spectrum
and smaller amplitudes of the magnetic field.

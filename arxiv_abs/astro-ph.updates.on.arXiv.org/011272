The main purpose of this study is to investigate aspects regarding the validity of the AGN unification
paradigm (UP). In particular we focus on the AGN host galaxies, which according to the UP should show
no systematic differences depending on the AGN classification. For the purpose of this study we
use (a) the spectroscopic SDSS (Sloan Digital Sky Survey) DR14 catalogue, in order to select and
classify AGNs using emission line diagnostics, up to a redshift of z=0.2, and (b) the Galaxy Zoo Project
catalogue, which classifies SDSS galaxies in two broad Hubble types, spirals and ellipticals.
We find that the fraction of type-1 Seyfert nuclei (Sy1) hosted in elliptical galaxies is significantly
larger than the corresponding fraction of any other AGN type, while there is a gradient of increasing
Spiral-hosts from Sy1 to Liner, type-2 Seyferts (Sy2) and Composite nuclei. These findings cannot
be interpreted within the standard Unification Paradigm, but possibly by a co-evolution scheme
for supermassive black holes (SMBH) and galactic bulges. Furthermore, for the case of spiral host
galaxies we find the Sy1 population to be strongly skewed towards face-on configurations, while
the corresponding Sy2 population range in all host-galaxy orientation configurations, having
a similar, but not identical, orientation distribution with star-forming galaxies (SF). These
results also cannot be interpreted by the standard Unification Paradigm, but point towards a significant
contribution of the galactic disk to the obscuration of the nuclear region. This is also consistent
with the observed preference of Sy1 nuclei to be hosted by ellipticals, ie., the dusty disk of spiral
hosts contributes to the obscuration of the broad line region (BLR) and thus relatively more ellipticals
are expected to appear hosting Sy1 nuclei.

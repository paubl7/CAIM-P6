Despite extended past studies, several questions regarding the resonant structure of the medium-Earth
orbit (MEO) region remain hitherto unanswered. This work describes in depth the effects of the $2g+h$
lunisolar resonance. In particular, (i) we compute the correct forms of the separatrices of the
resonance in the inclination-eccentricity space for fixed semi-major axis. This allows to compute
the change in the width of the $2g+h$ resonance as the altitude increases. (ii) We discuss the crucial
role played by the value of the inclination of the Laplace plane, $i_{L}$. Since $i_L$ is comparable
to the resonance's separatrix width, the parametrization of all resonance bifurcations has to
be done in terms of the proper inclination $i_{p}$, instead of the mean one. (iii) The subset of circular
orbits constitutes an invariant subspace embedded in the full phase space, the center manifold
$\mathcal{C}$. Using $i_p$ as a label, we compute its range of values for which $\mathcal{C}$ becomes
a normally hyperbolic invariant manifold (NHIM). The structure of invariant tori in $\mathcal{C}$
allows to explain the role of the initial phase $h$ noticed in several works. (iv) Through Fast Lyapunov
Indicator (FLI) cartography, we portray the stable and unstable manifolds of the NHIM as the altitude
increases. Manifold oscillations dominate in phase space between $a=24,000$ km and $a=30,000$
km as a result of the sweeping of the $2g+h$ resonance by the $h-\Omega_{\rm{Moon}}$ and $2h-\Omega_{\rm{Moon}}$
resonances. The noticeable effects of the latter are explained as a consequence of the relative
inclination of the Moon's orbit with respect to the ecliptic. The role of the phases $(h,\Omega_{\rm{Moon}})$
in the structures observed in the FLI maps is also clarified. Finally,(v) we discuss how the understanding
of the manifold dynamics could inspire end-of-life disposal strategies.

To investigate how molecular clouds react to different environmental conditions at a galactic
scale, we present a catalogue of giant molecular clouds resolved down to masses of $\sim 10$~M$_{\odot}$
from a simulation of the entire disc of an interacting M51-like galaxy and a comparable isolated
galaxy. Our model includes time-dependent gas chemistry, sink particles for star formation and
supernova feedback, meaning we are not reliant on star formation recipes based on threshold densities
and can follow the physics of the cold molecular phase. We extract giant molecular clouds at a given
timestep of the simulations and analyse their properties. In the disc of our simulated galaxies,
spiral arms seem to act merely as snowplows, gathering gas and clouds without dramatically affecting
their properties. In the centre of the galaxy, on the other hand, environmental conditions lead
to larger, more massive clouds. While the galaxy interaction has little effect on cloud masses and
sizes, it does promote the formation of counter-rotating clouds. We find that the identified clouds
seem to be largely gravitationally unbound at first glance, but a closer analysis of the hierarchical
structure of the molecular interstellar medium shows that there is a large range of virial parameters
with a smooth transition from unbound to mostly bound for the densest structures. The common observation
that clouds appear to be virialised entities may therefore be due to CO bright emission highlighting
a specific level in this hierarchical binding sequence. The small fraction of gravitationally
bound structures found suggests that low galactic star formation efficiencies may be set by the
process of cloud formation and initial collapse.

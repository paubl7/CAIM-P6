The presence of three more Herbig Ae/Be (HAeBe) stars in the Cepheus Flare within a 1.5$^{\circ}$
radius centered on HD 200775 suggests that star formation is prevalent in a wider region of the LDN
1147/1158, LDN 1172/1174, and LDN 1177 clouds. A number of young stellar objects (YSOs) are also
found to be located toward these clouds. Various star formation studies indicate ongoing low-mass
star formation inside this region. Sources associated with less near-infrared (IR) excess and
less H-alpha emission raise the possibility that more low-mass YSOs, which were not identified
in previous studies, are present in this region. The aim is to conduct a search for additional young
sources that are kinematically associated with the known YSOs and to characterize their properties.
Based on the Gaia DR2 distances and proper motions, we found that BD+68 1118, HD 200775, and PV Cep
are spatially and kinematically associated with known YSOs. Using the Gaia DR2 data, we identified
39 co-moving sources around BD+68 1118. These sources are characterized using optical and near-IR
color-color and color-magnitude diagrams. We estimated a distance of 340+/-7 pc to the whole association
that contains BD+68 1118, HD 200775, and PV Cep. Based on the distance and proper motions of all the
known YSOs, a total of 74 additional co-moving sources are found, of which 39 form a loose association
surrounding BD+68 1118. These sources are predominantly M-type with ages of $\sim$10 Myr and no
or very little near-IR excess emission. The positive expansion coefficients obtained via the projected
internal motions of the sources surrounding BD+68 1118 and HD 200775 show that these sources are
expanding with respect to their HAeBe stars. A spatio-temporal gradient of these sources toward
the center of the Cepheus Flare Shell supports the concept of star formation triggered by external
impacts.

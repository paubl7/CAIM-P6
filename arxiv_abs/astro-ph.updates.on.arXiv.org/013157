Open clusters provide clues to understand the evolution of Li7 at the surface of low-mass stars and
its possible correlation with stellar rotation, which is a challenge for both stellar hydrodynamics
and Galactic chemical evolution. We aim to quantify the efficiency of the transport processes for
both angular momentum and chemicals that are required to explain simultaneously the observed behaviour
of surface Li7 and rotation as well as the internal rotation profiles inferred from helio- and asteroseismology
in F- and G-type main sequence stars. We apply the model for the transport of angular momentum and
chemicals that we tailored in a previous work for solar-type stars to an extended range of initial
masses and metallicities corresponding to F- an G-type stars in a sample of 20 Galactic open clusters.
We evaluate its ability to explain the Li7, Be9, and rotation periods observations. Over the entire
range of masses, metallicities, and ages explored, we reproduce the evolution of the surface rotation
rates and predict, for the first time, the observed anti-correlation between the surface rotation
rate and Li7 depletion as a consequence of the penetrative convection prescription. However, the
ability of the model to reproduce the so-called Li7 dip centred around 6600K strongly depends on
the adopted prescriptions for shear turbulence. It also requires a stellar mass dependence for
the viscosity adopted for the transport of angular momentum, similar to the behaviour predicted
for the generation and luminosity of internal gravity waves generated by stellar convective envelopes.
We provide an efficient way to model G-type stars of different ages and metallicities successfully.
However, the Li7 and Be9 dip constraints call for further hydrodynamical studies to better model
turbulence in stars.

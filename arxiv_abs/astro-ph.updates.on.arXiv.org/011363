Eclipsing binaries (EBs) are unique benchmarks for stellar evolution. On the one hand, detached
EBs hosting at least one star with detectable solar-like oscillations constitute ideal test objects
to calibrate asteroseismic measurements. On the other hand, the oscillations and surface activity
of stars that belong to EBs offer unique information about the evolution of binary systems. This
paper builds upon previous works dedicated to red giant stars (RG) in EBs -- 20 known systems so far
-- discovered by the NASA Kepler mission. Here we report the discovery of 16 RGs in EBs also from the
Kepler data. This new sample includes three SB2-EBs with oscillations and six close systems where
the RG display a clear surface activity and complete oscillation suppression. Based on dedicated
high-resolution spectroscopic observations (Apache Point Observatory, Observatoire de Haute
Provence), we focus on three main aspects. From the extended sample of 14 SB2-EBs, we first confirm
that the simple application of the asteroseismic scaling relations to RGs overestimates masses
and radii of RGs, by about 15% and 5%. This bias can be reduced by employing either new asteroseismic
reference values for RGs, or model-based corrections of the asteroseismic parameters. Secondly,
we confirm that close binarity leads to a high level of photometric modulation (up to 10%), and a suppression
of solar-like oscillations. In particular, we show that it reduces the lifetime of radial modes
by a factor of up to 10. Thirdly, we use our 16 new systems to complement previous observational studies
that aimed at constraining tidal dissipation in interacting binaries. In particular, we identify
systems with circular orbits despite relatively young ages, which suggests exploring complementary
tidal dissipation mechanisms in the future. Finally, we report the measurements of mass, radius,
and age of three M-dwarf companion stars.

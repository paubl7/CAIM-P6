Recent work suggests that $^{26}$Al may determine the water budget in terrestrial exoplanets as
its radioactive decay dehydrates planetesimals leading to rockier compositions. Here I consider
the observed distribution of $^{26}$Al in the Galaxy and typical star-forming environments to
estimate the likelihood of $^{26}$Al enrichment during planet formation. I do not assume Solar-System-specific
constraints as I am interested in enrichment for exoplanets generally. Observations indicate
that high-mass stars dominate the production of $^{26}$Al with nearly equal contributions from
their winds and supernovae. $^{26}$Al abundances are comparable to those in the early Solar System
in the high-mass star-forming regions where most stars (and thereby most planets) form. These high
abundances appear to be maintained for a few Myr, much longer than the 0.7 Myr half-life. Observed
bulk $^{26}$Al velocities are an order of magnitude slower than expected from winds and supernovae.
These observations are at odds with typical model assumptions that $^{26}$Al is provided instantaneously
by high velocity mass loss from supernovae and winds. Regular replenishment of $^{26}$Al especially
when coupled with the small age differences that are common in high-mass star-forming complexes,
may significantly increase the number of star/planet-forming systems exposed to $^{26}$Al. Exposure
does not imply enrichment, but the order of magnitude slower velocity of $^{26}$Al may alter the
fraction that is incorporated into planet-forming material. Together, this suggests that the
conditions for rocky planet formation are not rare, nor are they ubiquitous, as small regions like
Taurus that lack high-mass stars to produce $^{26}$Al may be less likely to form rocky planets. I
conclude with suggested directions for future studies.

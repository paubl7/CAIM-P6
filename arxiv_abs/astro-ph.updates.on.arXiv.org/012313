In December 2018, the main-belt asteroid (6478)~Gault was reported to display activity. Gault
is an asteroid belonging to the Phocaea dynamical family and was not previously known to be active,
nor was any other member of the Phocaea family. In this work we present the results of photometric
and spectroscopic observations that commenced soon after the discovery of activity. We obtained
observations over two apparitions to monitor its activity, rotation period, composition, and
possible non-gravitational orbital evolution. We find that Gault has a rotation period of $P = 2.4929
\pm 0.0003$ hours with a lightcurve amplitude of $0.06$ magnitude. This short rotation period close
to the spin barrier limit is consistent with Gault having a density no smaller than $\rho = 1.85$~g/cm$^3$
and its activity being triggered by the YORP spin-up mechanism. Analysis of the Gault phase curve
over phase angles ranging from $0.4^{\circ}$ to $23.6^{\circ}$ provides an absolute magnitude
of $H = 14.81 \pm 0.04$, $G1=0.25 \pm 0.07$, and $G2= 0.38 \pm 0.04$. Model fits to the phase curve find
the surface regolith grain size constrained between 100-500 $\rm{\mu}$m. Using relations between
the phase curve and albedo we determine that the geometrical albedo of Gault is $p_{\rm v} = 0.26 \pm
0.05$ corresponding to an equivalent diameter of $D = 2.8^{+0.4}_{-0.2}$ km. Our spectroscopic
observations are all consistent with an ordinary chondrite-like composition (S, or Q-type in the
Bus-DeMeo taxonomic classification). A search through archival photographic plate surveys found
previously unidentified detections of Gault dating back to 1957 and 1958. Only the latter had been
digitized, which we measured to nearly double the observation arc of Gault. Finally, we did not find
any signal of activity during the 2020 apparition or non-gravitational effects on its orbit.

Solar coronal plumes long seemed to possess a simple geometry supporting spatially coherent, stable
outflow without significant fine structure. Recent high-resolution observations have challenged
this picture by revealing numerous transient, small-scale, collimated outflows ("jetlets")
at the base of plumes. The dynamic filamentary structure of solar plumes above these outflows, and
its relationship with the overall plume structure, have remained largely unexplored. We analyzed
the statistics of continuously observed fine structure inside a single representative bright
plume within a mid-latitude coronal hole during 2016 July 2-3. By applying advanced edge-enhancement
and spatiotemporal analysis techniques to extended series of high-resolution images from the
Solar Dynamics Observatory's Atmospheric Imaging Assembly, we determined that the plume was composed
of numerous time-evolving filamentary substructures, referred to as "plumelets" in this paper,
that accounted for most of the plume emission. The number of simultaneously identifiable plumelets
was positively correlated with plume brightness, peaked in the fully formed plume, and remained
saturated thereafter. The plumelets had transverse widths of 10 Mm and intermittently supported
upwardly propagating periodic disturbances with phase speeds of 190-260 km/s and longitudinal
wavelengths of 55-65 Mm. The characteristic frequency (3.5 mHz) is commensurate with that of solar
p-modes. Oscillations in neighboring plumelets are uncorrelated, indicating that the waves could
be driven by p-mode flows at spatial scales smaller than the plumelet separation. Multiple independent
sources of outflow within a single coronal plume should impart significant fine structure to the
solar wind that may be detectable by Parker Solar Probe and Solar Orbiter.

We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of the 03fg-like type Ia supernova (SN Ia)
ASASSN-15hy from the ultraviolet (UV) to the near-infrared (NIR). ASASSN-15hy shares many of the
hallmark characteristics of 03fg-like SNe Ia, previously referred to as "super-Chandrasekhar"
SNe Ia. It is bright in the UV and NIR, lacks a clear i-band secondary maximum, shows a strong and persistent
C II feature, and has a low Si II $\lambda$6355 velocity. However, some of its properties are also
extreme among the subgroup. ASASSN-15hy is under-luminous (M$_{B,peak}=-19.14^{+0.11}_{-0.16}$
mag), red ($(B-V)_{Bmax}=0.18^{+0.01}_{-0.03}$ mag), yet slowly declining ($\Delta{m_{15}}(B)=0.72
\pm 0.04$ mag). It has the most delayed onset of the i-band maximum of any 03fg-like SN. ASASSN-15hy
lacks the prominent H-band break emission feature that is typically present during the first month
past maximum in normal SNe Ia. Such events may be a potential problem for high-redshift SN Ia cosmology.
ASASSN-15hy may be explained in the context of an explosion of a degenerate core inside a non-degenerate
envelope. The explosion impacting the non-degenerate envelope with a large mass provides additional
luminosity and low ejecta velocities. An initial deflagration burning phase is critical in reproducing
the low $^{56}$Ni mass and luminosity, while the large core mass is essential in providing the large
diffusion time scales required to produce the broad light curves. The model consists of a rapidly
rotating 1.47 $M_{\odot}$ degenerate core and a 0.8 $M_{\odot}$ non-degenerate envelope. This
"deflagration core-degenerate" scenario may result from the merger between a white dwarf and the
degenerate core of an asymptotic giant branch star.

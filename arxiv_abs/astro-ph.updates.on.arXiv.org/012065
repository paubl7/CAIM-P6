A CCD photometry of the dwarf nova MASTER OT J172758.09 +380021.5 was carried out in 2019 during 134
nights. Observations covered three superoutbursts, five normal outbursts and quiescence between
them. The available ASASSN and ZTF data for 2014-2020 were also examined. Spectral observations
were done in 2020 when the object was in quiescence. Spectra and photometry revealed that the star
is an H-rich active ER UMa-type dwarf nova with a highly variable supercycle of ~50-100 d that implies
a high and variable mass-transfer rate. This object demonstrated peculiar behaviour: short-lasted
superoutbursts (a week); a slow superoutburst decline and cases of rebrightenings; low frequency
(from none to a few) of the normal outbursts during the supercycle. In 2019 a mean period of positive
superhumps was found to be 0.05829 d during the superoutbursts. Late superhumps with a mean period
of 0.057915 d which lasted about ~20 d after the end of superoutburst and were replaced by an orbital
period of 0.057026 d or its orbital-negative superhump beat period were detected. An absence of
eclipse in the orbital light curve and its moderate amplitude are consistent with the orbital inclination
of about 40 degr found from spectroscopy. The blue peaks of the V-Ic and B-Rc of superhumps during
the superoutburst coincided with minima of the light curves, while B-Rc of the late superhumps coincided
with a rising branch of the light curves. We found that a low mass ratio q=0.08 could explain most of
the peculiarities of this dwarf nova. The mass-transfer rate should be accordingly higher than
what is expected from gravitational radiation only, this assumes the object is in a post-nova state
and underwent a nova eruption relatively recently -- hundreds of years ago. This object would provide
probably the first observational evidence that a nova eruption can occur even in CVs near the period
minimum.

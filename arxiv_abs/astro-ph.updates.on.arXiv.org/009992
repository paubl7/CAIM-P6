(Abridged) The chemical composition of planetary atmospheres has long been thought to store information
regarding where and when a planet accretes its material. Predicting this chemical composition
theoretically is a crucial step in linking observational studies to the underlying physics that
govern planet formation. As a follow-up to a study of hot Jupiters in our previous work, we present
a population of warm Jupiters (semi-major axis between 0.5-4 AU) extracted from the same planetesimal
formation population synthesis model as used in our previous work. We compute the astrochemical
evolution of the protoplanetary disks included in this population to predict the carbon-to-oxygen
(C/O) and nitrogen-to-oxygen (N/O) ratio evolution of the disk gas, ice, and refractory sources,
the accretion of which greatly impacts the resulting C/O and N/O in the atmosphere of giant planets.
We confirm that the main sequence (between accreted solid mass and atmospheric C/O) we found previously
is largely reproduced by the presented population of synthetic warm Jupiters. And as a result, the
majority of the population fall along the empirically derived mass-metallicity relation when
the natal disk has solar or lower metallicity. Planets forming from disks with high metallicity
([Fe/H] $>$ 0.1) result in more scatter in chemical properties which could explain some of the scatter
found in the mass-metallicity relation. Combining predicted C/O and N/O ratios shows that Jupiter
does not fall among our population of synthetic planets, suggesting that it likely did not form in
the inner 5 AU of the solar system before proceeding into a Grand Tack. This result is consistent with
recent analysis of the chemical composition of Jupiter's atmosphere which suggests that it accreted
most of its heavy element abundance farther than tens of AU away from the Sun.

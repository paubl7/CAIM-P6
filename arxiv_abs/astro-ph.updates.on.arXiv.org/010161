Cometary meteoroid trails exist in the vicinity of comets, forming fine structure of the interplanetary
dust cloud. The trails consist predominantly of cometary particles with sizes of approximately
0.1 mm to 1 cm which are ejected at low speeds and remain very close to the comet orbit for several revolutions
around the Sun. When re-analysing the Helios dust data measured in the 1970s, Altobelli et al. (2006)
recognized a clustering of seven impacts, detected in a very narrow region of space at a true anomaly
angle of 135 deg, which the authors considered as potential cometary trail particles. We re-analyse
these candidate cometary trail particles to investigate the possibility that some or all of them
indeed originate from cometary trails and we constrain their source comets. The Interplanetary
Meteoroid Environment for eXploration (IMEX) dust streams in space model is a new universal model
for cometary meteoroid streams in the inner solar system, developed by Soja et al. (2015). Using
IMEX we study cometary trail traverses by Helios. During ten revolutions around the Sun, and in the
narrow region of space where Helios detected the candidate dust particles, the spacecraft repeatedly
traversed the trails of comets 45P/Honda-Mrkos-Pajduvsakova and 72P/Denning-Fujikawa. Based
on the detection times and particle impact directions, four detected particles are compatible
with an origin from these two comets. We find a dust spatial density in these trails of about 10^-8
to 10^-7 m^-3. The in-situ detection and analysis of meteoroid trail particles which can be traced
back to their source bodies by spacecraft-based dust analysers opens a new window to remote compositional
analysis of comets and asteroids without the necessity to fly a spacecraft to or even land on those
celestial bodies. This provides new science opportunities for future missions like Destiny+,
Europa Clipper and IMAP.

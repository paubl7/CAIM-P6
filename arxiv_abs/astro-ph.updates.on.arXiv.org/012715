The persistent thermal luminosity of magnetars and their outbursts suggest the existence of some
internal heat sources located in their outer crust. The compression of matter accompanying the
decay of the magnetic field may trigger exothermic electron captures and, possibly, pycnonuclear
fusions of light elements that may have been accreted onto the surface from the fallback of supernova
debris, from a disk or from the interstellar medium. This scenario bears some resemblance to deep
crustal heating in accreting neutron stars, although the matter composition and the thermodynamic
conditions are very different. The maximum possible amount of heat that can be released by each reaction
and their locations are determined analytically taking into account the Landau--Rabi quantization
of electron motion. Numerical results are also presented using experimental, as well as theoretical
nuclear data. Whereas the heat deposited is mainly determined by atomic masses, the locations of
the sources are found to be very sensitive to the magnetic field strength, thus providing a new way
of probing the internal magnetic field of magnetars. Most sources are found to be concentrated at
densities $10^{10}-10^{11}$ g cm$^{-3}$ with heat power $W^\infty\sim 10^{35}-10^{36}$ erg/s,
as found empirically by comparing cooling simulations with observed thermal luminosity. The change
of magnetic field required to trigger the reactions is shown to be consistent with the age of known
magnetars. This suggests that electron captures and pycnonuclear fusion reactions may be a viable
heating mechanism in magnetars. The present results provide consistent microscopic inputs for
neutron star cooling simulations, based on the same model as that underlying the Brussels-Montreal
unified equations of state.

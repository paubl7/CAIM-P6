We compare gravitational-wave (GW) signals from eight three-dimensional simulations of core-collapse
supernovae from Glas et al. (2019), using two different progenitors with zero-age main sequence
masses of 9 and 20 solar masses. The collapse of each progenitor was simulated four times, at two different
grid resolutions and with two different neutrino transport methods, using the Aenus-Alcar code.
The main goal of this study is to assess the validity of recent concerns that the so-called "Ray-by-Ray+"
(RbR+) approximation is problematic in core-collapse simulations and can adversely affect theoretical
GW predictions. Therefore, signals from simulations using RbR+ are compared to signals from corresponding
simulations using a fully multidimensional (FMD) transport scheme. The 9 solar-mass progenitor
successfully explodes, whereas the 20 solar-mass model does not. Both the standing accretion shock
instability and hot-bubble convection develop in the postshock layer of the non-exploding models.
In the exploding models, neutrino-driven convection in the postshock flow is established around
100 ms after core bounce and lasts until the onset of shock revival. We can, therefore, judge the impact
of the numerical resolution and neutrino transport under all conditions typically seen in non-rotating
core-collapse simulations. We find excellent qualitative agreement in all GW features and mostly
very satisfactory quantitative agreement between simulations using the different transport
schemes. Overall, resolution-dependent differences in the hydrodynamic behaviour of low-resolution
and high-resolution models turn out to have a greater impact on the GW signals than consequences
of the different transport methods. Furthermore, increasing the resolution decreases the discrepancies
between models with different neutrino transport.

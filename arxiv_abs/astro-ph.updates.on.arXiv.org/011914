Using 2D thermal structure models and pseudo-2D chemical kinetics models, we explore how atmospheric
temperatures and composition change as a function of altitude and longitude within the equatorial
regions of close-in transiting Neptune-class exoplanets at different distances from their host
stars. Our models predict that the day-night stratospheric temperature contrasts increase with
increasing planetary effective temperatures T_eff; atmospheric composition also changes significantly
with T_eff. Horizontal transport-induced quenching is very effective in our simulated exo-Neptune
atmospheres, acting to homogenize the vertical profiles of species abundances with longitude
at stratospheric pressures where infrared observations are sensitive. Our models have important
implications for planetary emission observations as a function of orbital phase with the Ariel
mission. Cooler solar-composition exo-Neptunes with T_eff = 500-700 K are predicted to have small
variations in infrared emission spectra with orbital phase, making them less robust phase-curve
targets for Ariel. Hot solar-composition exo-Neptunes with T_eff > 1300 K exhibit strong variations
in infrared emission with orbital phase but are arguably less interesting from an atmospheric chemistry
standpoint, with spectral signatures being dominated by a small number of species whose abundances
are expected to be constant with longitude and consistent with thermochemical equilibrium. Solar-composition
exo-Neptunes with T_eff = 900-1100 K reside in an interesting intermediate regime, with infrared
phase curve variations being affected by both temperature and composition variations. This interesting
intermediate regime shifts to smaller temperatures as atmospheric metallicity is increased,
making cool higher-metallicity Neptune-class planets appropriate targets for Ariel phase-curve
observations.

Many late time approaches for the solution of the Hubble tension use a late time smooth deformation
of the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$ of the Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM best fit $H(z)$ to match the locally
measured value of $H_0$ while effectively keeping the comoving distance to the last scattering
surface $r(z_{rec})$ and $\omega_m\equiv \Omega_{0m} h^2$ fixed to maintain consistency with
Planck CMB measurements. A well known problem of these approaches is that they worsen the fit to low
$z$ distance probes (BAO and SnIa). Here we show that another problem of these approaches is that
they worsen the level of the $\Omega_{0m}-\sigma_8$ growth tension. We use the CPL parametrization
of $H(z)$ corresponding to evolving dark energy equation of state parameter $w(z)=w_0+w_1\frac{z}{1+z}$
with local measurements $H_0$ prior and fixed values of $\Omega_{0m} h^2$ and $r(z_{rec})$ and
identify the pairs $(w_0, w_1)$ that satisfy these conditions. We show that for these models the
$\Omega_{0m}-\sigma_8$ tension between dynamical probe data (redshift space distortions) and
CMB constraints is worse than the corresponding tension that appears in the case of the standard
Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM model. We justify this feature using a full numerical solution of the growth
equation and fit to the data, as well as by using approximate analytic properties of the growth factor
of perturbations $\frac{\delta \rho}{\rho}(z)$ solution. A similar problem has been pointed
out for early time approaches to the Hubble crisis. The problem does not affect recent proposed solutions
of the Hubble crisis involving a SnIa intrinsic luminosity transition at $z_t\simeq 0.01$ that
can fully resolve both the Hubble and the growth tensions while being consistent with the Cepheid
distance calibrators at $z<0.01$.

We have performed a coordinated focused ion beam (FIB)-scanning and transmission electron microscopy
(S/TEM), electron probe microanalysis (EMPA)-synchrotron X-ray fluorescence (SXRF) microprobe
study to determine phase-specific microstructural characteristics and high-resolution in situ
trace element concentrations of primary pyrrhotite, pentlandite, and associated metal grains
from chondrules in CM2 and CR2 carbonaceous chondrites. This work is the first of its kind to link
trace element chemical and microstructural observations in chondritic sulfides in an attempt
to determine formation mechanisms and conditions of primary sulfides in these meteorite groups.
SXRF microprobe analyses allowed the concentrations of the minor and trace elements, Co, Cu, Ge,
Zn, and Se to be quantified, in addition to Fe and Ni, at a spatial resolution of 2 microns. The similarity
between the CM and CR PPI sulfide trace element patterns provides evidence for a common formation
mechanism for this type of sulfide grain in both meteorite groups. In addition, the SRM sulfide and
metal have comparable trace element patterns that indicates a genetic relationship between the
two, such as sulfidization of metal. Enrichments in Ni, Co, Cu, and Se are consistent with the chalcophile/siderophile
behavior of these elements. The observed depletions in Ge suggest that it may have been lost by evaporation
or else was never incorporated into the metal or sulfide precursor materials. The depletion in Zn
may also be attributable to evaporation, but, being partially lithophile, may also have been preferentially
incorporated into silicates during chondrule formation. Trace element concentrations support
crystallization from an immiscible sulfide melt in chondrules for formation of the PPI grains and
sulfidization of metal for the origin of the SRM grains.

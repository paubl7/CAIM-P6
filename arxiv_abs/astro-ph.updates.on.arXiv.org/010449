Abridged: Observed abundances of extremely metal-poor (EMP) stars in the Halo hold clues for the
understanding of the ancient universe. Interpreting these clues requires theoretical stellar
models at the low-Z regime. We provide the nucleosynthetic yields of intermediate-mass Z=$10^{-5}$
stars between 3 and 7.5 $M_{sun}$, and quantify the effects of the uncertain wind rates. We expect
these yields can be eventually used to assess the contribution to the chemical inventory of the early
universe, and to help interpret abundances of selected C-enhanced EMP stars. By comparing our models
and other existing in the literature, we explore evolutionary and nucleosynthetic trends with
wind prescriptions and with initial metallicity. We compare our results to observations of CEMP-s
stars belonging to the Halo. The yields of intermediate-mass EMP stars reflect the effects of very
deep second dredge-up (for the most massive models), superimposed with the combined signatures
of hot-bottom burning and third dredge-up. We confirm the reported trend that models with initial
metallicity Z$_{ini}$ <= 0.001 give positive yields of $^{12}C, ^{15}N, ^{16}O$, and $^{26}Mg$.
The $^{20}Ne, ^{21}Ne$, and $^{24}Mg$ yields, which were reported to be negative at Z$_{ini}$ =
0.0001, become positive for Z=$10^{-5}$. The results using two different prescriptions for mass-loss
rates differ widely in terms of the duration of the thermally-pulsing (Super) AGB phase, overall
efficiency of the third dredge-up episode, and nucleosynthetic yields. The most efficient of the
standard wind rates frequently used in the literature seems to favour agreement between our yield
results and observational data. Regardless of the wind prescription, all our models become N-enhanced
EMP stars.

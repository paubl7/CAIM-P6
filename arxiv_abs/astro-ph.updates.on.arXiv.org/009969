The central regions of disc galaxies hold clues to the processes that dominate their formation and
evolution. The TIMER project has obtained high signal-to-noise and spatial resolution integral-field
spectroscopy data of the inner few kpc of 21 nearby massive barred galaxies, allowing studies of
the stellar kinematics with unprecedented spatial resolution. We confirm theoretical predictions
of the effects of bars on stellar kinematics, and identify box/peanuts through kinematic signatures
in mildly and moderately inclined galaxies, finding a lower limit to the fraction of massive barred
galaxies with box/peanuts at ~62%. Further, we provide kinematic evidence of the connection between
barlenses, box/peanuts and bars. We establish the presence of nuclear discs in 19 galaxies and show
that their kinematics are characterised by near-circular orbits with low pressure support, and
are consistent with the bar-driven secular evolution picture for their formation. In fact, we show
that these nuclear discs have, in the region where they dominate, larger rotational support than
the underlying main galaxy disc. We define a kinematic radius for the nuclear discs and show that
it relates to bar radius, ellipticity and strength, and bar-to-total ratio. Comparing our results
with photometric studies, we find that state-of-the-art galaxy image decompositions are able
to discern nuclear discs from classical bulges, if the images employed have enough physical spatial
resolution. In fact, we show that nuclear discs are typically identified in such image decompositions
as photometric bulges with (near-)exponential profiles. However, we find that the presence of
composite bulges (galaxies hosting both a classical bulge and a nuclear disc) can often be unnoticed
in studies based on photometry alone, and suggest a more stringent threshold to the Sersic index
to identify galaxies with pure classical bulges.

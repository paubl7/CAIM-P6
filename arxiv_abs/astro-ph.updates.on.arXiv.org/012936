Simulations of exoplanet albedo profiles are key to planning and interpreting future direct imaging
observations. In this paper we demonstrate the use of the Planetary Spectrum Generator to produce
simulations of reflected light exoplanet spectra. We use PSG to examine multiple issues relevant
to all models of directly imaged exoplanet spectra and to produce sample spectra of the bright, nearby
exoplanet $\upsilon$ Andromedae d, a potential direct imaging target for next-generation facilities.
We introduce a new, fast, and accurate subsampling technique that enables calculations of disk-integrated
spectra one order of magnitude faster than Chebyshev-Gauss sampling for moderate- to high-resolution
sampling. Using this method and a first-principles-derived atmosphere for $\upsilon$ And d, we
simulate phase-dependent spectra for a variety of different potential atmospheric configurations.
The simulated spectra for $\upsilon$ And d include versions with different haze and cloud properties.
Based on our combined analysis of this planet's orbital parameters, phase-and illumination-appropriate
model spectra, and realistic instrument noise parameters, we find that $\upsilon$ And d is a potentially
favorable direct imaging and spectroscopy target for the Coronagraph Instrument (CGI) on the Nancy
Grace Roman Space Telescope. When a noise model corresponding to the Roman CGI SPC spectroscopy
mode is included, PSG predicts the time required to reach a signal-to-noise ratio of 10 of the simulated
spectra in both the central wavelength bin of the Roman CGI SPC spectroscopy mode (R=50 spectrum)
and of the Band 1 HLC imaging mode is approximately 400 and less than 40 hr, respectively. We also discuss
potential pathways to extricating information about the planet and its atmosphere with future
observations and find that Roman observations may be able to bound the interior temperature of the
planet.

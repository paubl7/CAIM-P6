Abbreviated. By selecting stars with similar ages and masses, the Young Suns Exoplanet Survey (YSES)
aims to detect and characterize planetary-mass companions to solar-type host stars in the Scorpius-Centaurus
association. Our survey is carried out with VLT/SPHERE with short exposure sequences on the order
of 5 min per star per filter. The subtraction of the stellar point spread function (PSF) is based on
reference star differential imaging (RDI) using the other targets in the survey in combination
with principal component analysis. We report the discovery of YSES 2b, a planetary-mass companion
to the K1 star YSES 2 (TYC 8984-2245-1). The primary has a Gaia EDR3 distance of 110 pc, and we derive
a revised mass of $1.1\,M_\odot$ and an age of approximately 14 Myr. We detect the companion in two
observing epochs southwest of the star at a position angle of 205$^\circ$ and with a separation of
$\sim1.05''$, which translates to a minimum physical separation of 115 au at the distance of the
system. We derive a photometric planet mass of $6.3^{+1.6}_{-0.9}\,M_\mathrm{Jup}$ using AMES-COND
and AMES-dusty evolutionary models; this mass corresponds to a mass ratio of $q=(0.5\pm0.1)$%
with the primary. This is the lowest mass ratio of a direct imaging planet around a solar-type star
to date. We discuss potential formation mechanisms and find that the current position of the planet
is compatible with formation by disk gravitational instability, but its mass is lower than expected
from numerical simulations. Formation via core accretion must have occurred closer to the star,
yet we do not find evidence that supports the required outward migration, such as via scattering
off another undiscovered companion in the system. YSES 2b is an ideal target for follow-up observations
to further the understanding of the physical and chemical formation mechanisms of wide-orbit Jovian
planets.

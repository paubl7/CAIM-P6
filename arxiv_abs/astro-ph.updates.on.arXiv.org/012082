Context. The birth environments of planetary systems are thought to influence planet formation
and orbital evolution, through external photoevaporation and stellar flybys. Recent work has
claimed observational support for this, in the form of a correlation between the properties of planetary
systems and the local Galactic phase space density of the host star. In particular, Hot Jupiters
are found overwhelmingly around stars in regions of high phase space density, which may reflect
a formation environment with high stellar density. Aims. We instead investigate whether the high
phase density may have a galactic kinematic origin: Hot Jupiter hosts may be biased towards being
young and therefore kinematically cold, because tidal inspiral leads to the destruction of the
planets on Gyr timescales, and the velocity dispersion of stars in the Galaxy increases on similar
timescales. Methods. We use 6D positions and kinematics from Gaia for the Hot Jupiter hosts and their
neighbours, and construct distributions of the phase space density. We investigate correlations
between the stars' local phase space density and peculiar velocity. Results. We find a strong anticorrelation
between the phase space density and the host star's peculiar velocity with respect to the Local Standard
of Rest. Therefore, most stars in "high-density" regions are kinematically cold, which may be caused
by the aforementioned bias towards detecting Hot Jupiters around young stars before the planets'
tidal destruction. Conclusions. We do not find evidence in the data for Hot Jupiter hosts preferentially
being in phase space overdensities compared to other stars, nor therefore for their originating
in birth environments of high stellar density.

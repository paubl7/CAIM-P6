Aromatic Infrared Bands (AIBs) are a set of bright and ubiquitous emission bands, observed in regions
illuminated by stellar ultraviolet photons, from our galaxy all the way out to cosmological distances.
The forthcoming James Webb Space Telescope will unveil unprecedented spatial and spectral details
in the AIB spectrum; significant advancement is thus necessary now to model the infrared emission
of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, their presumed carriers, with enough detail to exploit the
information content of the AIBs. This requires including anharmonicity in such models, and to do
so systematically for all species included, requiring a difficult compromise between accuracy
and efficiency. We propose a new recipe using minimal assumptions on the general behaviour of band
positions and widths with temperature, which can be defined by a small number of empirical parameters.
We explore here the performances of a full quantum method, AnharmoniCaOs, relying on an ab initio
potential, and Molecular Dynamics simulations using a Density Functional based Tight Binding
potential to determine these parameters for the case of pyrene, for which high temperature gas-phase
data are available. The first one is very accurate and detailed, but it becomes computationally
very expensive for increasing T; the second trades some accuracy for speed, making it suitable to
provide approximate, general trends at high temperatures. We propose to use, for each species and
band, the best available empirical parameters for a fast, yet sufficiently accurate spectral model
of PAH emission properly including anharmonicity. Modelling accuracy will depend critically
on these empirical parameters, allowing for an incremental improvement in model results, as better
estimates become gradually available.

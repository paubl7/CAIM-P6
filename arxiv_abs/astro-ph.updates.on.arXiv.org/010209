Neutral hydrogen (H$_{\rm I}$) intensity mapping is capable of measuring redshift evolution of
H$_{\rm I}$ density parameter $\Omega_{\rm H_{\rm I}}$, which is an important parameter to understand
structure formation in the post-reionization epoch. Future H$_{\rm I}$ observation with Square
Kilometre Array (SKA) can significantly improve constraints on the parameter. However, the observation
of H$_{\rm I}$ suffers from the contamination from extremely bright foreground emissions, and
it is necessary to consider a signal validation method complementary to the measurement of H$_{\rm
I}$ auto power spectrum. In this work, we propose to take a cross correlation between a 21cm-line
intensity map and a convergence map reconstructed from observation of the cosmic microwave background
by Planck and estimate expected ideal constraints on cosmological parametersby ignoring the foreground
contamination. We find that the SKA1-mid operated in single-dish mode has a sufficient capability
to detect the cross correlation on the large scales. Further, by Fisher analysis assuming a constant
linear bias of H$_{\rm I}$, $b$, and SKA1-mid observation of 1,000 hours for each of Band 1 and 2, we
show that $\Omega_{\rm H_{\rm I}} b$ can be constrained with a precision of $6-13\%$ at a wide range
of redshifts of $0.0<z<2.0$, if we fix other cosmological parameters (density parameter of cold
dark matter, $\Omega_{\rm c} h^{2}$, spectral index of primordial fluctuations, $n_s$, and Hubble
constant, $H_0$) using values from the Planck observations. On the other hand, small-scale measurements
with interferometer mode of SKA1-mid will not have a significant impact on constraining the parameters
with 1,000 hours of observation time for each of Band 1 and 2, due to the limited resolution of the CMB
lensing of Planck.

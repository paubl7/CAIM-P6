Dark Matter (DM) can be trapped by the gravitational field of any star, since collisions with nuclei
in dense environments can slow down the DM particle below the escape velocity ($v_{esc}$) at the
surface of the star. If captured, the DM particles can self annihilate, and, therefore, provide
a new source of energy for the star. We investigate this phenomenon for capture of DM particles with
mass ($m_X$) heavier than $100$ GeV by the first generation of stars (Pop III stars), by using the
recently developed multiscatter capture formalism. Pop III stars are particularly good DM captors,
since they form in DM rich environments, at the center of $~\sim 10^6 M_\odot$ DM minihalos, at redshifts
$z~\sim 15$. Assuming a DM-proton scattering cross section ($\sigma)$ at the deepest current exclusion
limits provided by the XENON1T experiment, we find that captured DM annihilations at the core of
Pop III stars can lead, via the Eddington limit, to upperbounds in stellar masses that can be as low
as a few $M_\odot$ if the ambient DM density ($\rho_X$) at the location of the Pop III star is sufficiently
high. Conversely, when Pop III stars are identified, one can use their observed mass ($M_\star$)
to place bounds on $\rho_X \sigma$. Using adiabatic contraction to estimate the ambient DM density
in the environment surrounding Pop III stars, we place projected upper limits on $\sigma$, for $M_\star$
in the $100-1000 M_\odot$ range, and find bounds that are competitive with, or deeper than, those
provided by the most sensitive current direct detection experiments. Most intriguingly, we find
that each of the Pop III stars considered could be used to probe below the "neutrino floor," and identify
the corresponding necessary ambient DM density.

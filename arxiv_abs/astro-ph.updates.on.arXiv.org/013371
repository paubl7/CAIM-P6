We present the first deep low frequency radio observations of the massive and highly disturbed galaxy
cluster Abell 2744 using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT). The cluster is experiencing
a very complex multiple merger and hosts a giant halo and four radio relics. The uGMRT observations,
together with existing VLA and Chandra observations, allow us to study the complexity of the physical
mechanisms active in this system. Our new images reveal that the central halo emission is more extended
toward low frequencies. We find that the integrated spectrum of the halo follows a power-law between
150 MHz and 3 GHz, while its subregions show significantly different spectra, also featuring high
frequency spectral steepening. The halo also shows local regions in which the spectral index is
significantly different from the average value. Our results highlight that an overall power-law
spectrum, as observed in many radio halos, may also arise from the superposition of different subcomponents.
The comparison of the radio surface brightness and spectral index with the X-ray brightness and
temperature reveals for the first time different trends, indicating that the halo consists of two
main components. All four relics in this system follow a power-law radio spectrum, compatible with
shocks with Mach numbers in the range $3.0-4.5$. All relics are also highly polarized from 1-4 GHz
and show low Faraday dispersion measures, suggesting that they are located in the outermost regions
of the cluster. The complexity in the distribution and properties of nonthermal components in Abell
2744 supports a multiple merger scenario, as also highlighted by previous X-ray and lensing studies.
Our unique results demonstrate the importance of sensitive and high-resolution, multi-frequency
radio observations for understanding the interplay between the thermal and non-thermal components
of the ICM.

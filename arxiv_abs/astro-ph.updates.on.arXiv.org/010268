We investigate sustenance and dependence on magnetic Prandtl number (${\rm Pm}$) for magnetorotational
instability (MRI)-driven turbulence in astrophysical Keplerian disks with zero net magnetic
flux using standard shearing box simulations. We focus on the turbulence dynamics in Fourier space,
capturing specific/noncanonical anisotropy of nonlinear processes due to disk flow shear. This
is a new type of nonlinear redistribution of modes over wavevector orientations in Fourier space
-- the nonlinear transverse cascade -- which is generic to shear flows and fundamentally different
from usual direct/inverse cascade. The zero flux MRI has no exponentially growing modes, so its
growth is transient, or nonmodal. Turbulence self-sustenance is governed by constructive cooperation
of the transient growth of MRI and the nonlinear transverse cascade. This cooperation takes place
at small wavenumbers (on the flow size scales) referred to as the vital area in Fourier space. The
direct cascade transfers mode energy from the vital area to larger wavenumbers. At large ${\rm Pm}$,
the transverse cascade prevails over the direct one, keeping most of modes' energy contained in
small wavenumbers. With decreasing ${\rm Pm}$, however, the action of the transverse cascade weakens
and can no longer oppose the action of direct cascade which more efficiently transfers energy to
higher wavenumbers, leading to increased resistive dissipation. This undermines the sustenance
scheme, resulting in the turbulence decay. Thus, the decay of zero net flux MRI-turbulence with
decreasing ${\rm Pm}$ is attributed to topological rearrangement of the nonlinear processes when
the direct cascade begins to prevail over the transverse cascade.

Rotation contributes to internal mixing processes and observed variability in massive stars.
A significant number of binary stars are not in strict synchronous rotation, including all eccentric
systems. This leads to a tidally induced and time-variable differential rotation structure. We
present a method for exploring the rotation structure of asynchronously rotating binaries. We
solve the equations of motion of a 3D grid of volume elements located above the rigidly rotating core
in the presence of gravitational, centrifugal, Coriolis, gas pressure and viscous forces to obtain
the angular velocity as a function of the three spatial coordinates and time. We find that the induced
rotation structure and its temporal variability depend on the degree of departure from synchronicity.
In eccentric systems, the structure changes over the orbital cycle with maximum amplitudes occurring
potentially at orbital phases other than periastron passage. We discuss the possible role of the
time-dependent tidal flows in enhancing the mixing efficiency and speculate that, in this context,
slowly rotating asynchronous binaries could have more efficient mixing than the analogous more
rapidly rotating but tidally locked systems. We find that some observed nitrogen abundances depend
on the orbital inclination, which, if real, would imply an inhomogeneous chemical distribution
over the stellar surface or that tidally induced spectral line variability, which is strongest
near the equator, affects the abundance determinations. Our models predict that, neglecting other
angular momentum transfer mechanisms, a pronounced initial differential rotation structure
converges toward average uniform rotation on the viscous timescale. We suggest that by taking into
account the processes that are triggered by asynchronous rotation, a broader perspective of binary
star structure, evolution and variability may be gleaned.

(Aims) In this work, we predict the far-infrared polarisation signal emitted by non-spherical
dust grains in nearby galaxies. We determine the angular resolution and sensitivity required to
study the magnetic field configuration in these galaxies. (Methods) We post-process a set of Milky
Way like galaxies from the Auriga project, assuming a dust mix consisting of spheroidal dust grains
that are partially aligned with the model magnetic field. We constrain our dust model using Planck
353 GHz observations of the Milky Way. This model is then extrapolated to shorter wavelengths that
cover the peak of interstellar dust emission and to observations of arbitrarily oriented nearby
Milky Way like galaxies. (Results) Assuming an intrinsic linear polarisation fraction that does
not vary significantly with wavelength for wavelengths longer than 50 micron, we predict a linear
polarisation fraction with a maximum of $10-15\%$ and a median value of $\approx{}7\%$ for face-on
galaxies and $\approx{}3\%$ for edge-on galaxies. The polarisation fraction anti-correlates
with the line of sight density and with the angular dispersion function which expresses the large
scale order of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight. The maximum linear polarisation
fraction agrees well with the intrinsic properties of the dust model. The true magnetic field orientation
can be traced along low density lines of sight when it is coherent along the line of sight. These results
also hold for nearby galaxies, where a coherent magnetic field structure is recovered over a range
of different broad bands. (Conclusions) Polarised emission from non-spherical dust grains accurately
traces the large scale structure of the galactic magnetic field in Milky Way like galaxies, with
expected maximum linear polarisation fractions of $10-15\%$. To resolve this maximum, a spatial
resolution of at least 1 kpc is required.

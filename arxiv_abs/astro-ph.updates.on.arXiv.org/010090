Context. The relative importance of AC and DC heating in maintaining the temperature of the corona
is not well constrained. Aims. Investigate the effects of the characteristic time scales of photospheric
driving on the injection and dissipation of energy within a coronal arcade. Methods. We have conducted
three dimensional MHD simulations of foot point driving imposed on an arcade. We modified the typical
driving time scales to understand the efficiency of heating obtained using AC and DC drivers. We
considered the implications for the injected Poynting flux and the nature of the energy release
in dissipative regimes. Results. For the same driver amplitude and complexity, long time scale
motions are able to inject a much greater Poynting flux into the corona. Consequently, in non-ideal
regimes, slow stressing motions result in a greater increase in plasma temperature than for wave-like
driving. In dissipative simulations, Ohmic heating is found to be much more significant than viscous
heating. For all drivers in our parameter space, energy dissipation is greatest close to the base
of the arcade where the magnetic field strength is strongest and at separatrix surfaces, where the
field connectivity changes. Across all simulations, the background field is stressed with random
foot point motions (in a manner typical of DC heating studies) and even for short time scale driving,
the injected Poynting flux is large given the small amplitude flows considered. For long time scale
driving, the rate of energy injection was comparable to the expected requirements in active regions.
The heating rates were found to scale with the perturbed magnetic field strength and not the total
field strength. Conclusions. Alongside recent studies which show power within the corona is dominated
by low frequency motions, our results suggest that in the closed corona, DC heating is more significant
than AC heating.

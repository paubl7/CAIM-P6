The new generation of VLTI instruments (GRAVITY, MATISSE) aims to produce routinely interferometric
images to uncover the morphological complexity of different objects at high angular resolution.
Image reconstruction is, however, not a fully automated process. Here we focus on a specific science
case, namely the complex circumbinary environments of a subset of evolved binaries, for which interferometric
imaging provides the spatial resolution required to resolve the immediate circumbinary environment.
Indeed, many binaries where the main star is in the post-asymptotic giant branch (post-AGB) phase
are surrounded by circumbinary disks. Those disks were first inferred from the infrared excess
produced by dust. Snapshot interferometric observations in the infrared confirmed disk-like
morphology and revealed high spatial complexity of the emission that the use of geometrical models
could not recover without being strongly biased. Arguably, the most convincing proof of the disk-like
shape of the circumbinary environment came from the first interferometric image of such a system
(IRAS08544-4431) using the PIONIER instrument at the VLTI. This image was obtained using the SPARCO
image reconstruction approach that enables to subtract a model of a component of the image and reconstruct
an image of its environment only. In the case of IRAS08544-4431, the model involved a binary and the
image of the remaining signal revealed several unexpected features. Then, a second image revealed
a different but also complex circumstellar morphology around HD101584 that was well studied by
ALMA. To exploit the VLTI imaging capability to understand these targets, we started a large program
at the VLTI to image post-AGB binary systems using both PIONIER and GRAVITY instruments.

Radio Active Galactic Nuclei (RAGNs) are mainly found in dense structures (i.e., clusters/groups)
at redshifts of z$<$2 and are commonly used to detect protoclusters at higher redshift. Here, we
attempt to study the host and environmental properties of two relatively faint ($\mathrm L_\mathrm{1.4GHz}
\sim10^{25}$ W Hz$^{-1}$) RAGNs in a known protocluster at z=3.3 in the PCl J0227-0421 field, detected
using the latest radio observation obtained as part of the Observations of Redshift Evolution in
Large-Scale Environments (ORELSE) Survey. Using new spectroscopic observations obtained from
Keck/MOSFIRE as part of the Charting Cluster Construction with the VIMOS Ultra-Deep Survey (VUDS)
and ORELSE (C3VO) survey and previous spectroscopic data obtained as part of the VIMOS-VLT Deep
Survey (VVDS) and VUDS, we revise the three-dimensional overdensity field around this protocluster.
The protocluster is embedded in a large scale overdensity protostructure. This protostructure
has an estimated total mass of $\sim$2.6$\times10^{15} M_\odot$ and contains several overdensity
peaks. Both RAGNs are hosted by very bright and massive galaxies, while their hosts show extreme
differences color, indicating that they have different ages and are in different evolutionary
stages. Furthermore, we find that they are not in the most locally dense parts of the protostructure,
but are fairly close to the centers of their parent overdensity peaks. We propose a scenario where
merging might already have happened in both cases, which lowered the local density of their surrounding
area and boosted their stellar mass. This work is the first time that two RAGNs at low luminosity have
been found and studied within a high redshift protostructure.

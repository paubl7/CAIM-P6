The Extreme Universe Space Observatory on a Super Pressure Balloon 1 (EUSO-SPB1) instrument was
launched out of Wanaka, New Zealand, by NASA in April, 2017 as a mission of opportunity. The detector
was developed as part of the Joint Experimental Missions for the Extreme Universe Space Observatory
(JEM-EUSO) program toward a space-based ultra-high energy cosmic ray (UHECR) telescope with the
main objective to make the first observation of UHECRs via the fluorescence technique from suborbital
space. The EUSO-SPB1 instrument is a refractive telescope consisting of two 1m$^2$ Fresnel lenses
with a high-speed UV camera at the focal plane. The camera has 2304 individual pixels capable of single
photoelectron counting with a time resolution of 2.5$\mu$s. A detailed performance study including
calibration was done on ground. We separately evaluated the properties of the Photo Detector Module
(PDM) and the optical system in the laboratory. An end-to-end test of the instrument was performed
during a field campaign in the West Desert in Utah, USA at the Telescope Array (TA) site in September
2016. The campaign lasted for 8 nights. In this article we present the results of the preflight laboratory
and field tests. Based on the tests performed in the field, it was determined that EUSO-SPB1 has a
field of view of 11.1$^\circ$ and an absolute photo-detection efficiency of 10%. We also measured
the light flux necessary to obtain a 50% trigger efficiency using laser beams. These measurements
were crucial for us to perform an accurate post flight event rate calculation to validate our cosmic
ray search. Laser beams were also used to estimated the reconstruction angular resolution. Finally,
we performed a flat field measurement in flight configuration at the launch site prior to the launch
providing a uniformity of the focal surface better than 6%.

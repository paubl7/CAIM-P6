The radio, optical, and $\gamma$-ray light curves of the blazar S5 1803+784, from the beginning
of the {\it Fermi} Large Area Telescope (LAT) mission in August 2008 until December 2018, are presented.
The aim of this work is to look for correlations among different wavelengths useful for further theoretical
studies. We analyzed all the data collected by {\it Fermi} LAT for this source, taking into account
the presence of nearby sources, and we collected optical data from our own observations and public
archive data to build the most complete optical and $\gamma$-ray light curve possible. Several
$\gamma$-ray flares ($\mathrm{F>2.3~10^{-7} ph(E>0.1 GeV)~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}}$) with optical
coverage were detected, all but one with corresponding optical enhancement; we also found two optical
flares without a $\gamma$-ray counterpart. We obtained two {\it Swift} Target of Opportunity observations
during the strong flare of 2015. Radio observations performed with VLBA and EVN through our proposals
in the years 2016-2020 were analyzed to search for morphological changes after the major flares.
The optical/$\gamma$-ray flux ratio at the flare peak varied for each flare. Very minor optical
V-I color changes were detected during the flares. The X-ray spectrum was well fitted by a power law
with photon spectral index $\alpha$=1.5, nearly independent of the flux level: no clear correlation
with the optical or the $\gamma$-ray emission was found. The $\gamma$-ray spectral shape was well
fitted by a power law with average photon index $\alpha$= 2.2. These findings support an Inverse
Compton origin for the high-energy emission of the source, nearly co-spatial with the optically
emitting region. The radio maps showed two new components originating from the core and moving outwards,
with ejection epochs compatible with the dates of the two largest $\gamma$-ray flares.

We explore the influence of non-geodesic pressure forces that are present in an accretion disk on
the frequencies of its axisymmetric and non-axisymmetric epicyclic oscillation modes. {We discuss
its implications for models of high-frequency quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) that have been
observed in the X-ray flux of accreting black holes (BHs) in the three Galactic microquasars, GRS
1915+105, GRO J1655$-$40 and XTE J1550$-$564. We focus on previously considered QPO models that
deal with low azimuthal number epicyclic modes, $\lvert m \rvert \leq 2$, and outline the consequences
for the estimations of BH spin, $a\in[0,1]$.} For four out of six examined models, we find only small,
rather insignificant changes compared to the geodesic case. For the other two models, on the other
hand, there is a fair increase of the estimated upper limit on the spin. Regarding the QPO model's
falsifiability, we find that one particular model from the examined set is incompatible with the
data. If the microquasar's spectral spin estimates that point to $a>0.65$ were fully confirmed,
two more QPO models would be ruled out. Moreover, if two very different values of the spin, such as
$a\approx 0.65$ in GRO J1655$-$40 vs. $a\approx 1$ in GRS 1915+105, were confirmed, all the models
except one would remain unsupported by our results. Finally, we discuss the implications for a model
recently proposed in the context of neutron star (NS) QPOs as a disk-oscillation-based modification
of the relativistic precession model. This model provides overall better fits of the NS data and
predicts more realistic values of the NS mass compared to the relativistic precession model. We
conclude that it also implies a significantly higher upper limit on the microquasar's BH spin ($a\sim
0.75$ vs. $a\sim 0.55$).

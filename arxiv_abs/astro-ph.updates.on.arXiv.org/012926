SS Cyg has long been recognized as the prototype of a group of dwarf novae that show only outbursts.
However, this object has entered a quite anomalous event in 2021, which at first appeared to be standstill,
i.e., an almost constant luminosity state, observed in Z Cam-type dwarf novae. This unexpected
event gives us a great opportunity to reconsider the nature of standstill in cataclysmic variables.
We have observed this anomalous event and its forerunner, a gradual and simultaneous increase in
the optical and X-ray flux during quiescence, through many optical telescopes and the X-ray telescopes
NICER and NuSTAR. We have not found any amplification of the orbital hump during quiescence before
the anomalous event, which suggests that the mass transfer rate did not significantly fluctuate
on average. The estimated X-ray flux was not enough to explain the increment of the optical flux during
quiescence via X-ray irradiation of the disk and the secondary star. It would be natural to consider
that viscosity in the quiescent disk was enhanced before the anomalous event, which increased mass
accretion rates in the disk and raised not only the optical flux but also the X-ray flux. We suggest
that enhanced viscosity also triggered the standstill-like phenomenon in SS Cyg, which is considered
to be a series of small outbursts. The inner part of the disk would always stay in the outburst state
and only its outer part would be unstable against the thermal-viscous instability during this phenomenon,
which is consistent with the observed optical color variations. This scenario is in line with our
X-ray spectral analyses which imply that the X-ray emitting inner accretion flow became hotter
than usual and vertically expanded and that it became denser and was cooled down after the onset of
the standstill-like state.

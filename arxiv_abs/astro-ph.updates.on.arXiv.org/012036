The transition region between the North Equatorial Band (NEBn) and North Tropical Zone (NTrZ) in
Jupiter is home to convective storms, systems of cyclones and anticyclones and atmospheric waves.
A large anticyclone formed in the year 2006 at planetographic latitude 19N and persists since then
after a complex dynamic history, being possibly the third longest-lived oval in the planet after
Jupiter's Great Red Spot and oval BA. This anticyclone has experienced close interactions with
other ovals, merging with another oval in February 2013; it has also experienced color changes,
from white to red (September 2013). The oval survived the effects of the closely located North Temperate
Belt Disturbance, which occurred in October 2016 and fully covered the oval, rendering it unobservable
for a short time. When it became visible again at its expected longitude from its previous longitudinal
track, it reappeared as a white large oval keeping this color and the same morphology since 2017 at
least until the onset of the new convective disturbance in Jupiter's North Temperate Belt in August
2020. Here we describe the historic evolution of the properties of this oval. We use JunoCam and Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) images to measure its size and its internal rotation. We also used HST and PlanetCam-UPV/EHU
multi-wavelength observations to characterize its color changes and Junocam images to unveil
its detailed structure. The color and the altitude-opacity indices show that the oval is higher
and has redder clouds than its environment but has lower cloud tops than other large ovals like the
GRS, and it is less red than the GRS and oval BA. We show that in spite of the dramatic environmental
changes suffered by the oval during all these years, its main characteristics are stable in time
and therefore must be related with the atmospheric dynamics below the observable cloud decks.

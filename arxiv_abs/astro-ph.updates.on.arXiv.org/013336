The C/O-ratio as traced with C$_2$H emission in protoplanetary disks is fundamental for constraining
the formation mechanisms of exoplanets and our understanding of volatile depletion in disks, but
current C$_2$H observations show an apparent bimodal distribution which is not well understood,
indicating that the C/O distribution is not described by a simple radial dependence. The transport
of icy pebbles has been suggested to alter the local elemental abundances in protoplanetary disks,
through settling, drift and trapping in pressure bumps resulting in a depletion of volatiles in
the surface and an increase of the elemental C/O. We combine all disks with spatially resolved ALMA
C$_2$H observations with high-resolution continuum images and constraints on the CO snowline
to determine if the C$_2$H emission is indeed related to the location of the icy pebbles. We report
a possible correlation between the presence of a significant CO-icy dust reservoir and high C$_2$H
emission, which is only found in disks with dust rings outside the CO snowline. In contrast, compact
dust disks (without pressure bumps) and warm transition disks (with their dust ring inside the CO
snowline) are not detected in C$_2$H, suggesting that such disks may never have contained a significant
CO ice reservoir. This correlation provides evidence for the regulation of the C/O profile by the
complex interplay of CO snowline and pressure bump locations in the disk. These results demonstrate
the importance of including dust transport in chemical disk models, for a proper interpretation
of exoplanet atmospheric compositions, and a better understanding of volatile depletion in disks,
in particular the use of CO isotopologues to determine gas surface densities.

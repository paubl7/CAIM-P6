M dwarfs are ideal targets for the search of Earth-size planets in the habitable zone using the radial
velocity method, attracting the attention of many ongoing surveys. As a by-product of these surveys,
new multiple stellar systems are also found. This is the case also for the CARMENES survey, from which
nine new SB2 systems have already been announced. Throughout the five years of the survey, the accumulation
of new observations has resulted in the detection of several new multiple stellar systems with long
periods and low radial-velocity amplitudes. Here, we newly characterise the spectroscopic orbits
and constrain the masses of eight systems and update the properties of a system that we reported earlier.
We derive the radial velocities of the stars using two-dimensional cross correlation techniques
and template matching. The measurements are modelled to determine the orbital parameters of the
systems. We combine CARMENES spectroscopic observations with archival high-resolution spectra
from other instruments to increase the time-span of the observations and improve our analysis.
When available, we also added archival photometric, astrometric, and adaptive optics imaging
data to constrain the rotation periods and absolute masses of the components. We determine the spectroscopic
orbits of nine multiple systems, eight of which are presented for the first time. The sample is composed
of five SB1s, two SB2s, and two ST3s. The companions of two of the single-line binaries, GJ 3626 and
GJ 912, have minimum masses below the stellar boundary and, thus, could be brown dwarfs. We find a
new white dwarf in a close binary orbit around the M star GJ 207.1. From a global fit to radial velocities
and astrometric measurements, we are able to determine the absolute masses of the components of
GJ 282C, which is one of the youngest systems with measured dynamical masses.

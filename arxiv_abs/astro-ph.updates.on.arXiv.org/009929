(Abridged) We use optical spectroscopy to investigate the disk, wind, and accretion during the
2008 ZCMa NW outburst. Over 1000 optical emission lines reveal accretion, a variable, multi-component
wind, and double-peaked lines of disk origin. The variable, non-axisymmetric, accretion-powered
wind has slow ($\sim $0 km s$^{-1}$), intermediate ($\sim -$100 km s$^{-1}$) and fast ($\geq -$400
km s$^{-1}$) components. The fast components are of stellar origin and disappear in quiescence,
while the slow component is less variable and could be related to a disk wind. The changes in the optical
depth of the lines between outburst and quiescence are consistent with increased accretion being
responsible for the observed outburst. We derive an accretion rate of 10$^{-4}$ M$_\odot$/yr in
outburst. The Fe I and weak Fe II lines arise from an irradiated, flared disk at $\sim$0.5-3 $\times$M$_*$/16M$_\odot$
au with asymmetric upper layers, revealing that the energy from the accretion burst is deposited
at scales below 0.5 au. Some line profiles have redshifted asymmetries, but the system is unlikely
sustained by magnetospheric accretion, especially in outburst. The accretion-related structures
extend over several stellar radii and, like the wind, are likely non-axisymmetric. The stellar
mass may be $\sim$6-8 M$_\odot$, lower than previously thought ($\sim$16 M$_\odot$). Emission
line analysis is found to be a powerful tool to study the innermost regions and accretion in stars
within a very large range of effective temperatures. The density ranges in the disk and accretion
structures are higher than in late-type stars, but the overall behavior, including the innermost
disk emission and variable wind, is very similar independently of the spectral type. Our work suggests
a common outburst behavior for stars with spectral types ranging from M-type to intermediate-mass
stars.

While Euclid is an ESA mission specifically designed to investigate the nature of Dark Energy and
Dark Matter, the planned unprecedented combination of survey area ($\sim15\,000$ deg$^2$), spatial
resolution, low sky-background, and depth also make Euclid an excellent space observatory for
the study of the low surface brightness Universe. Scientific exploitation of the extended low surface
brightness structures requires dedicated calibration procedures yet to be tested. We investigate
the capabilities of Euclid to detect extended low surface brightness structure by identifying
and quantifying sky background sources and stray-light contamination. We test the feasibility
of generating sky flat-fields to reduce large-scale residual gradients in order to reveal the extended
emission of galaxies observed in the Euclid Survey. We simulate a realistic set of Euclid/VIS observations,
taking into account both instrumental and astronomical sources of contamination, including cosmic
rays, stray-light, zodiacal light, ISM, and the CIB, while simulating the effects of the presence
of background sources in the FOV. We demonstrate that a combination of calibration lamps, sky flats
and self-calibration would enable recovery of emission at a limiting surface brightness magnitude
of $\mu=29.5^{+0.08}_{-0.27} $ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ ($3\sigma$, $10\times10$ arcsec$^2$) in the
Wide Survey, reaching regions 2 magnitudes deeper in the Deep Surveys. Euclid/VIS has the potential
to be an excellent low surface brightness observatory. Covering the gap between pixel-to-pixel
calibration lamp flats and self-calibration observations for large scales, the application of
sky flat-fielding will enhance the sensitivity of the VIS detector at scales of larger than 1 degree,
up to the size of the FOV, enabling Euclid to detect extended surface brightness structures below
$\mu=31$ mag arcsec$^{-2}$ and beyond.

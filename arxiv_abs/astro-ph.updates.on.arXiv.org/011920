We investigate the evolution and origin of small-scale chromospheric swirls by analyzing numerical
simulations of the quiet solar atmosphere, using the radiative magnetohydrodynamic code CO$5$BOLD.
We are interested in finding their relation with magnetic field perturbations and in the processes
driving their evolution. For the analysis, the swirling strength criterion and its evolution equation
are applied in order to identify vortical motions and to study their dynamics. We introduce a new
criterion, the magnetic swirling strength, which allows us to recognize torsional perturbations
in the magnetic field. We find a strong correlation between swirling strength and magnetic swirling
strength, in particular in intense magnetic flux concentrations, which suggests a tight relation
between vortical motions and torsional magnetic field perturbations. Furthermore, we find that
swirls propagate upward with the local Alfv\'en speed as unidirectional swirls, in the form of pulses,
driven by magnetic tension forces alone. In the photosphere and low chromosphere, the rotation
of the plasma co-occurs with a twist in the upwardly directed magnetic field that is in the opposite
direction of the plasma flow. All together, these are characteristics of torsional Alfv\'en waves.
We also find indications of an imbalance between the hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic baroclinic
effects being at the origin of the swirls. At the base of the chromosphere, we find a net upwardly directed
Poynting flux, which is mostly associated with large and complex swirling structures that we interpret
as the superposition of various small-scale vortices. We conclude that the ubiquitous swirling
events observed in simulations are tightly correlated with perturbations of the magnetic field.
At photospheric and chromospheric levels, they form Alfv\'en pulses that propagate upward and
may contribute to chromospheric heating.

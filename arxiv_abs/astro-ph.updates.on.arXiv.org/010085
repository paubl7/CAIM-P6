Astronomers have discovered thousands of planets outside the solar system, most of which orbit
stars that will eventually evolve into red giants and then into white dwarfs. During the red giant
phase, any close-orbiting planets will be engulfed by the star, but more distant planets can survive
this phase and remain in orbit around the white dwarf. Some white dwarfs show evidence for rocky material
floating in their atmospheres, in warm debris disks, or orbiting very closely, which has been interpreted
as the debris of rocky planets that were scattered inward and tidally disrupted. Recently, the discovery
of a gaseous debris disk with a composition similar to ice giant planets demonstrated that massive
planets might also find their way into tight orbits around white dwarfs, but it is unclear whether
the planets can survive the journey. So far, the detection of intact planets in close orbits around
white dwarfs has remained elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a giant planet candidate transiting
the white dwarf WD 1856+534 (TIC 267574918) every 1.4 days. The planet candidate is roughly the same
size as Jupiter and is no more than 14 times as massive (with 95% confidence). Other cases of white
dwarfs with close brown dwarf or stellar companions are explained as the consequence of common-envelope
evolution, wherein the original orbit is enveloped during the red-giant phase and shrinks due to
friction. In this case, though, the low mass and relatively long orbital period of the planet candidate
make common-envelope evolution less likely. Instead, the WD 1856+534 system seems to demonstrate
that giant planets can be scattered into tight orbits without being tidally disrupted, and motivates
searches for smaller transiting planets around white dwarfs.

We aim to investigate the spatial location of the source of an active region (AR) jet and its relation
with associated nonthermal type~III radio emission. An emission measure (EM) method was used to
study the thermodynamic nature of the AR jet. The nonthermal type~{\rm III} radio burst observed
at meterwavelength was studied using the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) radio imaging and spectroscopic
data. The local configuration of the magnetic field and the connectivity of the source region of
the jet with open magnetic field structures was studied using a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF)
extrapolation and potential field source surface (PFSS) extrapolation respectively. The plane-of-sky
velocity of the AR jet was found to be $\sim$136~km/s. The EM analysis confirmed the presence of low
temperature 2~MK plasma for the spire, whereas hot plasma, between 5-8 MK, was present at the footpoint
region which also showed the presence of Fe~{\sc xviii} emission. A lower limit on the electron number
density was found to be 1.4$\times$10$^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$ for the spire and 2.2$\times$10$^{8}$~cm$^{-3}$
for the footpoint. A temporal and spatial correlation between the AR jet and nonthermal type III
burst confirmed the presence of open magnetic fields. An NLFFF extrapolation showed that the photospheric
footpoints of the null point were anchored at the location of the source brightening of the jet. The
spatial location of the radio sources suggests an association with the extrapolated closed and
open magnetic fields although strong propagation effects are also present. The multi-scale analysis
of the field at local, AR, and solar scales confirms the interlink between different flux bundles
involved in the generation of the type III radio signal with flux transferred from a small coronal
hole to the periphery of the sunspot via null point reconnection with an emerging structure.

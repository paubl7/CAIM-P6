The US National Park Service (NPS) Night Skies Program measured changes in sky brightness resulting
from a countywide lighting retrofit project. The retrofit took place in Chelan County, a gateway
community to North Cascades National Park and Lake Chelan National Recreation Area in Washington
State. The county retrofitted all 3,693 county-owned high pressure sodium (HPS) street lamps to
full cutoff LEDs. This number is about 60% of the County's total outdoor street and area lights. About
80% of the newly installed lights were 3000K in color temperature and 20% were 4000K. The 4000K LEDs
were used to meet Washington State Department of Transportation guidelines. To measure sky brightness,
we used the NPS night sky camera system before the retrofit started in 2018 and after its completion
in 2019. These images were photometrically calibrated and mosaicked together to provide hemispherical
images in V band. For comparison with our ground-based measurement, we obtained the satellite imagery
taken by Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) onboard the Suomi National Polar-orbiting
Partnership satellite. Our measurements show that the post-retrofit skyglow became brighter
and extended higher in the sky, but upward radiance, as measured by the day-night band radiometer,
decreased. These divergent results are likely explained by a substantial increase in light emitted
at wavelengths shorter than 500 nm, and a relative decrease in zenith light emission due to better
shielded luminaires. These results also demonstrate that earlier models relating VIIRS day-night
band data to skyglow will, at a minimum, require substantial revision to account for the different
characteristics of solid state luminaires.

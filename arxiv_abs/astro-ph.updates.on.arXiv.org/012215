The dispersal of protoplanetary disks sets the timescale available for planets to assemble, and
thus it is one of the fundamental parameters in theories of planetary formation. Disk dispersal
is determined by several properties of the central star, the disk itself, and the surrounding environment.
In particular, the metallicity of disks may impact their evolution, even if to date controversial
results exist: in low-metallicity clusters disks seem to rapidly disperse, while in the Magellanic
Clouds some evidence supports the existence of accreting disks few tens of Myrs old. In this paper
we study the dispersal timescale of disks in Dolidze~25, the young cluster in proximity of the Sun
with lowest metallicity, with the aim of understanding whether disk evolution is impacted by the
low-metallicity of the cluster. We have analyzed Chandra/ACIS-I observations of the cluster and
combined the resulting source catalog with existing optical and infrared catalogs of the region.
We selected the disk-bearing population and the disk-less population of Dolidze 25. We have derived
stellar parameters from isochrones fitted to color-magnitude diagrams. We derived a disk fraction
of about 34% and a median age of 1.2 Myrs. By comparing this estimate with existing estimates of the
disk fraction of clusters younger than 10 Myrs, our study suggests that the disk fraction of Dolidze
25 is lower than what is expected from its age alone. Even if our results are not conclusive given the
intrinsic uncertainty on stellar ages estimated from isochrones fitting to color-magnitude diagrams,
we suggest that disk evolution in Dolidze 25 may be impacted by the environment. Given the poor O star
population and low stellar density of the cluster, it is more likely that disks dispersal timescale
is dictated more by the low metallicity of the cluster rather than external photoevaporation or
dynamical encounters.

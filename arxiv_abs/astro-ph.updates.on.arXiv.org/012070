Context: Precise chemical abundances coupled with reliable ages are key ingredients to understand
the chemical history of our Galaxy. Open Clusters (OCs) are useful for this purpose because they
provide ages with good precision. Aims: The aim of this work is to investigate the relations of different
chemical abundance ratios vs age traced by red clump (RC) stars in OCs. Methods: We analyze a large
sample of 209 reliable members in 47 OCs with available high-resolution spectroscopy. We applied
a differential line-by-line analysis to provide a comprehensive chemical study of 25 chemical
species. This sample is among the largest samples of OCs homogeneously characterized in terms of
atmospheric parameters, detailed chemistry, and ages. Results: In our metallicity range (-0.2<[M/H]<+0.2)
we find that while most Fe-peak and alpha elements have flat dependence with age, the s-process elements
show decreasing trends with increasing age with a remarkable knee at 1 Gyr. For Ba, Ce, Y, Mo and Zr
we find a plateau at young ages (< 1 Gyr). We investigate the relations of all possible combinations
among the computed chemical species with age. We find 19 combinations with significant slopes,
including [Y/Mg] and [Y/Al]. The ratio [Ba/alpha] is the one with the most significant correlations
found. Conclusions: We find that the [Y/Mg] relation found in the literature using Solar twins is
compatible with the one found here in the Solar neighbourhood. The age-abundance relations show
larger scatter for clusters at large distances (d>1 kpc) than for the Solar neighbourhood, particularly
in the outer disk. We conclude that these relations need to be understood also in terms of the complexity
of the chemical space introduced by the Galactic dynamics, on top of pure nucleosynthetic arguments,
especially out of the local bubble.

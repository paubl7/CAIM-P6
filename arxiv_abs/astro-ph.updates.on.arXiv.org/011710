It is known that hydrodynamic triangular jets are unstable to antisymmetric kink perturbations.
The inclusion of magnetic field may lead to the stabilisation of the jets. Jets and complex magnetic
fields are ubiquitous in the solar atmosphere, which suggests the possibility of the kink instability
in certain cases. The aim of the paper is to study the kink instability of triangular jets sandwiched
between magnetic tubes/slabs and its possible connection to observed properties of the jets in
the solar atmosphere. A dispersion equation governing the kink perturbations is obtained through
matching of analytical solutions at the jet boundaries. The equation is solved analytically and
numerically for different parameters of jets and surrounding plasma. The analytical solution
is accompanied by a numerical simulation of fully nonlinear MHD equations for a particular situation
of solar type II spicules. MHD triangular jets are unstable to the dynamic kink instability depending
on the Alfven Mach number (the ratio of flow to Alfven speeds) and the ratio of internal and external
densities. When the jet has the same density as the surrounding plasma, then only super Alfvenic
flows are unstable. However, denser jets are unstable also in sub Alfvenic regime. Jets with an angle
to the ambient magnetic field have much lower thresholds of instability than field-aligned flows.
Growth times of the kink instability are estimated as 6-15 min for type I spicules and 5-60 s for type
II spicules matching with their observed life times. Numerical simulation of full nonlinear equations
shows that the transverse kink pulse locally destroys the jet in less than a minute in the conditions
of type II spicules. Dynamic kink instability may lead to full breakdown of MHD flows and consequently
to observed disappearance of spicules in the solar atmosphere.

Helioseismology is the study of the solar interior using observations of oscillations at the surface.
It suffers from systematic errors, such as a center-to-limb error in travel-time measurements.
Understanding these errors requires a good understanding of the nontrivial relationship between
wave displacement and helioseismic observables. The wave displacement causes perturbations
in the atmospheric thermodynamical quantities which perturb the opacity, the optical depth, the
source function, and the local ray geometry, thus affecting the emergent intensity. We aim to establish
the most complete relationship up to now between the displacement and the intensity perturbation
by solving the radiative transfer problem in the atmosphere. We derive an expression for the intensity
perturbation caused by acoustic oscillations at any point on the solar disk by applying the first-order
perturbation theory. As input, we consider adiabatic modes of oscillation of different degrees.
The background and the perturbed intensities are computed considering the main sources of opacity
in the continuum. We find that, for all modes, the perturbations to the thermodynamical quantities
are not sufficient to model the intensity. In addition, the geometrical effects due to the displacement
must be taken into account as they lead to a difference in amplitude and a phase shift between the temperature
at the surface and intensity perturbations. The closer to the limb, the larger the differences.
This work presents improvements for the computation of the intensity perturbations, in particular
for high-degree modes, and explains differences in intensity computations in earlier works. The
phase shifts and amplitude differences between the temperature and intensity perturbations increase
towards the limb. This should help to interpret some of the systematic center-to-limb effects observed
in local helioseismology.

The mass-accretion rate, Macc, is a crucial parameter for the study of the evolution of accretion
disks around young low-mass stellar objects (YSOs) and for planet formation studies. The Taurus
star forming region (SFR) is rich in pre-main sequence (PMS) stars, most of them of the T Tauri class.
A variety of methodologies have been used in the past to measure mass accretion in samples of YSOs
in Taurus, but despite being a general benchmark for star formation studies, a comprehensive and
systematic analysis of the Taurus T Tauri population, where the stellar and accretion properties
are derived homogeneously and simultaneously, is still missing. As part of the GIARPS High-resolution
Observations of T Tauri stars (GHOsT) project, here we present a pilot study of the stellar and accretion
properties of seven YSOs in Taurus using the spectrograph GIARPS at the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo
(TNG). Contemporaneous low-resolution spectroscopic and photometric ancillary observations
allow us to perform an accurate flux calibration of the high-resolution spectra. The simultaneity
of the high-resolution, wide-band spectroscopic observations, from the optical to the near-infrared
(NIR), the veiling measurements in such wide spectral range, and many well-calibrated emission
line diagnostics allows us to derive the stellar and accretion properties of the seven YSOs in a homogeneous
and self-consistent way. The procedures and methodologies presented here will be adopted in future
works for the analysis of the complete GHOsT data set. We discuss the accretion properties of the
seven YSOs in comparison with the 90\% complete sample of YSOs in the Lupus SFR and investigate possibilities
for the origin of the continuum excess emission in the NIR. }

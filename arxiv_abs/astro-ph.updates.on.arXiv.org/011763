Solar energetic particles (SEPs) accelerated from shocks driven by coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
are one of the major causes of geomagnetic storms on Earth. Therefore, it is necessary to predict
the occurrence and intensity of such disturbances. For this purpose we analyzed in detail 38 non-interacting
halo and partial halo CMEs, as seen by the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory /Large Angle and Spectrometric
Coronagraph (SOHO/LASCO), generating SEPs (in >10 MeV, >50 MeV, and >100 MeV energy channels) during
the quadrature configuration of the Solar TErrestrial RElations Observatory (STEREO) twin spacecrafts
with respect to the Earth, which marks the ascending phase of solar cycle 24 (i.e., 2009-2013). The
main criteria for this selection period is to obtain height-time measurements of the CMEs without
significant projection effects and in a very large field of view. Using the data from STEREO/Sun
Earth Connection Coronal and Heliospheric Investigation (STEREO / SECCHI) images we determined
several kinematic parameters and instantaneous speeds of the CMEs. First, we compare instantaneous
CME speed and Mach number versus SEP fluxes for events originating at the western and eastern limb
we observe high correlation for the western events and anticorrelation for the eastern events.
Next we investigated instantaneous CME kinematic parameters such as maximum speed, maximum Mach
number, and the CME speed and Mach number at SEP peak flux versus SEP peak fluxes. Highly positive
correlation is observed for Mach number at SEP peak flux for all events. The obtained instantaneous
Furthermore, we conducted estimates of delay in time and distance between CME, SEP, and shock parameters.
Comparative studies of the considered energy channels of the SEPs also throw light on the reacceleration
of suprathermal seed ions by CME-driven shocks that are pre-accelerated in the magnetic reconnection.

During their formation, planets form large, hot atmospheres due to the ongoing accretion of solids.
It has been customary to assume that all solids end up at the center constituting a "core" of refractory
materials, whereas the envelope remains metal-free. Recent work, as well as observations by the
JUNO mission, indicate however that the distinction may not be so clear cut. Indeed, small silicate,
pebble-sized particles will sublimate in the atmosphere when they hit the sublimation temperature
(T ~ 2000 K). In this paper we extend previous analytical work to compute the properties of planets
under such a pebble accretion scenario. We conduct 1D numerical calculations of the atmosphere
of an accreting planet, solving the stellar structure equations, augmented by a non-ideal equation
of state that describes a hydrogen/helium-silicate vapor mixture. Calculations terminate at
the point where the total mass in metal equals that of the H/He gas, which we numerically confirm as
the onset of runaway gas accretion. When pebbles sublimate before reaching the core, not enough
(accretion) energy is available to mix dense, vapor-rich lower layers with the higher layers of
lower metallicity. A gradual structure in which Z decreases with radius is therefore a natural outcome
of planet formation by pebble accretion. We highlight, furthermore, that (small) pebbles can act
as the dominant source of opacity, preventing rapid cooling and presenting a channel for (mini-)Neptunes
to survive in gas-rich disks. Nevertheless, once pebble accretion subsides, the atmosphere rapidly
clears followed by runaway gas accretion. We consider atmospheric recycling to be the more probable
mechanisms that have stalled the growth of these planets' envelopes.

The objective of this paper is to help shedding some light on the nature and the properties of the cold
structures formed via thermal instability in the magnetized atomic interstellar medium. To this
end, we searched for clumps formed in forced (magneto)hydrodynamic simulations with an initial
magnetic field ranging from 0 to 8.3$\mu$G. We statistically analyzed, through the use of Kernel
Density Estimations, the physical and the morphological properties of a sample containing $\sim
1500$ clumps, as well as the relative alignments between the main direction of clumps and the internal
velocity and magnetic field. The density ($n\sim 50-200$cm$^{-3}$), the thermal pressure ($P_{th}/k\sim
4.9\times 10^3-10^4$K cm$^{-3}$), the mean magnetic field ($\sim 3-11$$\mu$G ), and the sonic
Mach number of the selected clumps have values comparable to those reported in observations. We
find, however, that the cloud sample can not be described by a single regime concerning their pressure
balance and their Alf\'enic Mach number. We measured the morphological properties of clumps mainly
through the asphericity and the prolatness, which appear to be more sensitive than the aspect ratios.
From this analysis we find that the presence of magnetic field, even if it is weak, does qualitatively
affect the morphology of the clumps by increasing the probability of having highly aspherical and
highly plolate clumps by a factor of two, that is by producing more filamentary clumps. Finally,
we find that the angle between the main direction of the clumps and the local magnetic field lies between
$\sim\pi/4-\pi/2$ and shifts to more perpendicular alignments as the intensity of this field increases,
while the relative direction between the local density structure and the local magnetic field transits
from parallel to perpendicular.

Galaxies with nuclear bars are believed to efficiently drive gas inward, generating a nuclear starburst
and possibly an active galactic nucleus (AGN). We confirm this scenario for the isolated, double-barred,
luminous infrared galaxy ESO 320-G030 based on an analysis of Herschel and ALMA spectroscopic observations.
Herschel/PACS and SPIRE observations of ESO 320-G030 show absorption/emission in 18 lines of H2O,
which we combine with the ALMA H2O 423-330 448 GHz line (Eupper~400 K) and continuum images to study
the nuclear region. Radiative transfer models indicate that 3 nuclear components are required
to account for the H2O and continuum data. An envelope, with R~130-150 pc, T_dust~50 K, and N_H2~2x10^{23}
cm^{-2}, surrounds a nuclear disk with R~40 pc and tau_100um~1.5-3 (N_H2~2x10^{24} cm^{-2}) and
an extremely compact (R~12 pc), warm (~100 K), and buried (tau_100um>5, N_H2>~5x10^{24} cm^{-2})
core component. The three nuclear components account for 70% of the galaxy L_IR (SFR~16-18 Msun
yr^{-1}). The nucleus is fed by a molecular inflow observed in CO 2-1 with ALMA, which is associated
with the nuclear bar. With decreasing radius (r=450-225 pc), the mass inflow rate increases up to
~20 Msun yr^{-1}, which is similar to the nuclear SFR, indicating that the starburst is sustained
by the inflow. At lower r, the inflow is best probed by the far-infrared OH ground-state doublets,
with an estimated inflow rate of ~30 Msun yr^{-1}. The short timescale of ~20 Myr for nuclear gas replenishment
indicates quick secular evolution, and indicates that we are witnessing an intermediate stage
(<100 Myr) proto-pseudobulge fed by a massive inflow that is driven by a strong nuclear bar. We also
apply the H2O model to the Herschel far-infrared spectroscopic observations of H2^{18}O, OH, $^{18}OH,
OH+, H2O^+, H3O^+, NH, NH2, NH3, CH, CH^+, ^{13}CH^+, HF, SH, and C3, and estimate their abundances.

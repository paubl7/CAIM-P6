While the CO(1-0) transition is often used to deduce the total molecular hydrogen in galaxies, it
is challenging to detect in low metallicity galaxies, in spite of the star formation taking place.
In contrast, the [CII] 158 micron line is relatively bright, highlighting a potentially important
reservoir of H2 that is not traced by CO(1-0), but residing in the C+ - emitting regions. We explore
a method to quantify the total H2 mass (MH2) in galaxies and learn what parameters control the CO-dark
gas reservoir. We present Cloudy grids of density, radiation field and metallicity in terms of observed
quantities, such as [OI], [CI], CO(1-0), [CII], total infrared luminosity and the total MH2 and
provide recipes based on these models to derive total MH2 mass estimates from observations. The
models are applied to the Herschel Dwarf Galaxy Survey, extracting the total MH2 for each galaxy
which is compared to the H2 determined from the observed CO(1-0) line. While the H2 traced by CO(1-0)
can be negligible, the [CII] 158 micron line can trace the total H2. 70% to 100% of the total H2 mass
is not traced by CO(1-0) in the dwarf galaxies, but is well-traced by [CII] 158 micron line. The CO-dark
gas mass fraction correlates with the observed L[CII]/LCO(1-0) ratio. A conversion factor for
[CII] luminosity to total H2 and a new CO-to-total-MH2 conversion factor, as a function of metallicity,
is presented. A recipe is provided to quantify the total mass of H2 in galaxies, taking into account
the CO and [CII] observations. Accounting for this CO-dark H2 gas, we find that the star forming dwarf
galaxies now fall on the Schmidt-Kennicutt relation. Their star-forming efficiency is rather
normal, since the reservoir from which they form stars is now more massive when introducing the [CII]
measures of the total H2, compared to the little amount of H2 in the CO-emitting region.

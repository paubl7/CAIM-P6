The processes that shape the extended atmospheres of red supergiants (RSGs), heat their chromospheres,
create molecular reservoirs, drive mass loss, and create dust remain poorly understood. Betelgeuse's
V-band "Great Dimming" event of 2019 September /2020 February and its subsequent rapid brightening
provides a rare opportunity to study these phenomena. Two different explanations have emerged
to explain the dimming; new dust appeared in our line of sight attenuating the photospheric light,
or a large portion of the photosphere had cooled. Here we present five years of Wing three-filter
(A, B, and C band) TiO and near-IR photometry obtained at the Wasatonic Observatory. These reveal
that parts of the photosphere had a mean effective temperature $(T_{\rm eff}$) significantly lower
than that found by (Levesque & Massey 2020). Synthetic photometry from MARCS -model photospheres
and spectra reveal that the V band, TiO index, and C-band photometry, and previously reported 4000-6800
Angstrom spectra can be quantitatively reproduced if there are multiple photospheric components,
as hinted at by VLT-SPHERE images (Montarges et al. 2020). If the cooler component has $\Delta T_{\rm
eff} \ge 250$ K cooler than 3650 K, then no new dust is required to explain the available empirical
constraints. A coincidence of the dominant short- ($\sim 430$ day) and long-period ($\sim 5.8$
yr) V-band variations occurred near the time of deep minimum (Guinan et al. 2019). This is in tandem
with the strong correlation of V mag and photospheric radial velocities, recently reported by Dupree
et al. (2020b). These suggest that the cooling of a large fraction of the visible star has a dynamic
origin related to the photospheric motions, perhaps arising from pulsation or large-scale convective
motions.

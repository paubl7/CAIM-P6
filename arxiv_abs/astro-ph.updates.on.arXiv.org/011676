We investigate the impact of different assumptions in the modeling of one-loop galaxy bias on the
recovery of cosmological parameters, as a follow up of the analysis done in the first paper of the
series at fixed cosmology. We use three different synthetic galaxy samples whose clustering properties
match the ones of the CMASS and LOWZ catalogues of BOSS and the SDSS Main Galaxy Sample. We investigate
the relevance of allowing for either short range non-locality or scale-dependent stochasticity
by fitting the real-space galaxy auto power spectrum or the combination of galaxy-galaxy and galaxy-matter
power spectrum. From a comparison among the goodness-of-fit ($\chi^2$), unbiasedness of cosmological
parameters (FoB), and figure-of-merit (FoM), we find that a four-parameter model (linear, quadratic,
cubic non-local bias, and constant shot-noise) with fixed quadratic tidal bias provides a robust
modelling choice for the auto power spectrum of the three samples, up to $k_{\rm max}=0.3\,h\,\mathrm{Mpc}^{-1}$
and for an effective volume of $6\,h^{-3}\,\mathrm{Gpc}^3$. Instead, a joint analysis of the two
observables fails at larger scales, and a model extension with either higher derivatives or scale-dependent
shot-noise is necessary to reach a similar $k_{\rm max}$, with the latter providing the most stable
results. These findings are obtained with three, either hybrid or perturbative, prescriptions
for the matter power spectrum, \texttt{RESPRESSO}, gRPT and EFT. In all cases, the inclusion of
scale-dependent shot-noise increases the range of validity of the model in terms of FoB and $\chi^2$.
Interestingly, these model extensions with additional free parameters do not necessarily lead
to an increase in the maximally achievable FoM for the cosmological parameters $\left(h,\,\Omega_ch^2,\,A_s\right)$,
which are generally consistent to those of the simpler model at smaller $k_{\rm max}$.

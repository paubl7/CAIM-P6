Supernova (SN) explosions, through the metals they release, play a pivotal role in the chemical
evolution of the Universe and the origin of life. Nebular phase spectroscopy constrains such metal
yields, for example through forbidden line emission associated with OI, CaII, FeII, or FeIII. Fluid
instabilities during the explosion produce a complex 3D ejecta structure, with considerable macroscopic,
but no microscopic, mixing of elements. This structure sets a formidable challenge for detailed
nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium radiative transfer modeling, which is generally limited
to 1D in grid-based codes. Here, we present a novel and simple method that allows for macroscopic
mixing without any microscopic mixing, thereby capturing the essence of mixing in SN explosions.
With this new technique, the macroscopically mixed ejecta is built by shuffling in mass space, or
equivalently in velocity space, the shells from the unmixed coasting ejecta. The method requires
no change to the radiative transfer, but necessitates high spatial resolution to resolve the rapid
variation in composition with depth inherent to this shuffled-shell structure. We show results
for a few radiative-transfer simulations for a Type II SN explosion from a 15Msun progenitor star.
Our simulations capture the strong variations in temperature or ionization between the various
shells that are rich in H, He, O, or Si. Because of nonlocal energy deposition, gamma rays permeate
through an extended region of the ejecta, making the details of the shell arrangement unimportant.
The greater physical consistency of the method delivers spectral properties at nebular times that
are more reliable, in particular in terms of individual emission line strengths, which may serve
to constrain the SN yields and, for core collapse SNe, the progenitor mass. The method works for all
SN types.

Deuterated molecules are good tracers of the evolutionary stage of star-forming cores. During
the star formation process, deuterated molecules are expected to be enhanced in cold, dense pre-stellar
cores and to deplete after protostellar birth. In this paper we study the deuteration fraction of
formaldehyde in high-mass star-forming cores at different evolutionary stages to investigate
whether the deuteration fraction of formaldehyde can be used as an evolutionary tracer. Using the
APEX SEPIA Band 5 receiver, we extended our pilot study of the $J$=3$\rightarrow$2 rotational lines
of HDCO and D$_2$CO to eleven high-mass star-forming regions that host objects at different evolutionary
stages. High-resolution follow-up observations of eight objects in ALMA Band 6 were performed
to reveal the size of the H$_2$CO emission and to give an estimate of the deuteration fractions HDCO/H$_2$CO
and D$_2$CO/HDCO at scales of $\sim$6" (0.04-0.15 pc at the distance of our targets). Our observations
show that singly- and doubly deuterated H$_2$CO are detected toward high-mass protostellar objects
(HMPOs) and ultracompact HII regions (UCHII regions), the deuteration fraction of H$_2$CO is also
found to decrease by an order of magnitude from the earlier HMPO phases to the latest evolutionary
stage (UCHII), from $\sim$0.13 to $\sim$0.01. We have not detected HDCO and D$_2$CO emission from
the youngest sources (high-mass starless cores, HMSCs). Our extended study supports the results
of the previous pilot study: the deuteration fraction of formaldehyde decreases with evolutionary
stage, but higher sensitivity observations are needed to provide more stringent constraints on
the D/H ratio during the HMSC phase. The calculated upper limits for the HMSC sources are high, so
the trend between HMSC and HMPO phases cannot be constrained.

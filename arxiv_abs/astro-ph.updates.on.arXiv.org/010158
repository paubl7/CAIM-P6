The galaxy size-stellar mass and central surface density-stellar mass relationships are observational
constraints on galaxy formation models. However, inferring the physical size of a galaxy from observed
stellar emission is non-trivial due to various observational effects. Consequently, forward-modeling
light-based sizes from simulations is desirable. In this work, we use the {\skirt} dust radiative
transfer code to generate synthetic observations of massive galaxies ($M_{*}\sim10^{11}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$
at $z=2$, hosted by haloes of mass $M_{\rm{halo}}\sim10^{12.5}\,\rm{M_{\odot}}$) from high-resolution
cosmological zoom-in simulations that form part of the Feedback In Realistic Environments (FIRE)
project. The simulations used in this paper include explicit stellar feedback but no active galactic
nucleus (AGN) feedback. From each mock observation, we infer the effective radius ($R_e$), as well
as the stellar mass surface density within this radius and within $1\,\rm{kpc}$ ($\Sigma_e$ and
$\Sigma_1$, respectively). We first investigate how well the intrinsic half-mass radius and stellar
mass surface density can be inferred from observables. The predicted sizes and surface densities
are within a factor of two of the intrinsic values. We then compare our predictions to the observed
size-mass relationship and the $\Sigma_1-M_\star$ and $\Sigma_e-M_\star$ relationships. At
$z\gtrsim2$, the simulated massive galaxies are in general agreement with observational scaling
relations. At $z\lesssim2$, they evolve to become too compact but still star-forming, in the stellar
mass and redshift regime where many of them should be quenched. Our results suggest that some additional
source of feedback, such as AGN driven outflows, is necessary in order to decrease the central densities
of the simulated massive galaxies to bring them into agreement with observations at $z\lesssim2$.

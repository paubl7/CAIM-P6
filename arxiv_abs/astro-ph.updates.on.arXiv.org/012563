Solar active regions are associated with Evershed outflows in sunspot penumbrae, moat outflows
surrounding sunspots, and extended inflows surrounding active regions. The latter have been identified
on established active regions by various methods. The evolution of these inflows and their dependence
on active region properties as well as their impact on the global magnetic field are not yet understood.
We aim to understand the evolution of the average inflows around emerging active regions and to derive
an empirical model for these inflows. We analyze horizontal flows at the surface of the Sun using
local correlation tracking of solar granules observed in continuum images of SDO/HMI. We measure
average flows of a sample of 182 isolated active regions up to seven days before and after their emergence
onto the solar surface with a cadence of 12 hours. We investigate the average inflow properties with
respect to active region characteristics of total flux and latitude. We fit a model to these observed
inflows for a quantitative analysis. We find that converging flows of around $20$ to $30$ m/s are
first visible one day prior to emergence, in agreement with recent results. These converging flows
are present independently of active region properties of latitude or flux. We confirm a recently
found prograde flow of about $40$ m/s at the leading polarity during emergence. We find that the time
after emergence when the latitudinal inflows increase in amplitude depends on the flux of the active
region, ranging from one to four days after emergence and increasing with flux. The largest extent
of the inflows is up to about $7 \pm 1^\circ$ away from the center of the active region within the first
six days after emergence. The inflow velocities have amplitudes of about $50$ m/s.

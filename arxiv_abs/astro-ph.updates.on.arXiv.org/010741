Post-starburst galaxies (PSBs) belong to a short-lived transition population between star-forming
and quiescent galaxies and are found in all environments and at all redshifts. Deciphering their
heavily discussed evolutionary pathways is paramount to understanding the processes that drive
galaxy evolution in general. We aim to determine the dominant mechanisms governing PSB galaxy evolution
in both the field and in galaxy clusters. To understand the different physical processes involved
in PSB galaxy evolution, we analyse the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suite Magneticum
Pathfinder. At $z \sim 0$, we identify and study a set of 647 PSBs with stellar masses $M_* \geq 4.97
\cdot 10^{10}$, in comparison to a quiescent and a star-forming control sample. We track the galactic
evolution, merger history, and black holes of PSBs and control samples over a time-span of 3.6Gyr.
Additionally, we study cluster PSBs identified at different redshifts and cluster masses. Independent
of environment and redshift, we find that PSBs, similar to the star-forming control sample, have
frequent mergers. At $z=0$, 89% of PSBs have experienced at least one merger, and 65% even had a major
merger event within the last 2.5Gyr, leading to episodes of strong star formation. In fact, 23% of
$z=0$ PSBs were rejuvenated during their starburst. After the mergers, field PSBs are generally
shutdown via a strong increase in AGN feedback. Furthermore, we find agreement with observations
for both stellar mass functions and $z = 0.9$ line-of-sight phase space distributions of galaxy
cluster PSBs. Finally, we find that $z \lesssim 0.5$ cluster PSBs are predominantly infalling,
especially in high mass clusters and show no signs of enhanced AGN activity. Thus, we conclude that
the majority of cluster PSBs are shutdown via an environmental quenching mechanism such as ram-pressure
stripping.

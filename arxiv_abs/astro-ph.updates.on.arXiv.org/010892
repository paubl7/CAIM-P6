Context: The formation of rocky planetesimals is a long-standing problem in planet formation theory.
One of the possibilities is that it results from gravitational instability as a result of pile-up
of small silicate dust particles released from sublimating icy pebbles that pass the snow line.
Aims: We want to understand and quantify the role of the water snow line for the formation of rock-rich
and ice-rich planetesimals. In this paper, we focus on the formation of rock-rich planetesimals.
A companion paper examines the combined formation of both rock-rich and ice-rich planetesimals.
Methods: We develop a new Monte Carlo code to calculate the radial evolution of silicate particles
in a turbulent accretion disk, accounting for the back-reaction (i.e., inertia) of the particles
on their radial drift velocity and diffusion. Results depend in particular on the particle injection
width (determined from the radial sublimation width of icy pebbles), the pebble scale height and
the pebble mass flux through the disk. The scale height evolution of the silicate particles, which
is the most important factor for the runaway pile-up, is automatically calculated in this Lagrange
method. Results: From the numerical results, we derive semi-analytical relations for the scale
height of the silicate dust particles and the particles-to-gas density ratio at the midplane, as
functions of a pebble-to-gas mass flux ratio and the $\alpha$ parameters for disk gas accretion
and vertical/radial diffusion. We find that the runaway pile-up of the silicate particles (formation
of rocky planetesimals) occurs if the pebble-to-gas mass flux ratio is $> [(\alpha_{Dz}/\alpha_{acc})/3
\times 10^{-2}]^{1/2}$ where $\alpha_{Dz}$ and $\alpha_{acc}$ are the $\alpha$ parameters for
vertical turbulent diffusion and disk gas accretion.

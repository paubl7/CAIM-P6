It is well known that low mass young stellar objects (LMYSOs) gain a significant portion of their
final mass through episodes of very rapid accretion, with mass accretion rates up to $\dot M_* \sim
10^{-4} M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. Recent observations of high mass young stellar objects (HMYSO)
with masses $M_* \gtrsim 10 M_{\odot}$ uncovered outbursts with accretion rates exceeding $\dot
M_*\sim 10^{-3}M_{\odot}$~yr$^{-1}$. Here we examine which scenarios proposed in the literature
so far to explain accretion bursts of LMYSOs can apply to the episodic accretion in HMYSOs. We utilise
a 1D time dependent models of protoplanetary discs around HMYSOs to study burst properties. We find
that discs around HMYSOs are much hotter than those around their low mass cousins. As a result, much
more extended regions of the disc are prone to the thermal hydrogen ionisation and MRI activation
instabilities. The former in particular is found to be ubiquitous in a very wide range of accretion
rates and disc viscosity parameters. The outbursts triggered by these instabilities, however,
always have too low $\dot M_*$, and are one to several orders of magnitude too long compared to those
observed from HMYSOs so far. On the other hand, bursts generated by tidal disruptions of gaseous
giant planets formed by the gravitational instability of the protoplanetary discs yield properties
commensurate with observations, provided that the clumps are in the post-collapse configuration
with planet radius $R_{\rm p} \gtrsim 10 $ Jupiter radii. Furthermore, if observed bursts are caused
by disc ionisation instabilities then they should be periodic phenomena with the duration of the
quiescent phase comparable to that of the bursts. This may yield potentially observable burst periodicity
signatures in the jets, the outer disc, or the surrounding diffuse material of massive HMYSOs. (abridged)

Tidal disruption events (TDEs) in active galactic nuclei (AGN) can trigger dramatic change of accretion
rate, providing us the greatest opportunity to catch the insight of AGN structure and physics. In
this letter, we report the optical Fe II response to the central outburst in PS1-10adi, a well-known
TDE candidate in AGN at $z=0.203$. The Fe II strength rises rapidly and reaches the maximum after
55 days of the optical peak, and then declines gradually. We find an unprecedented phenomenon that
the Fe II variation rate (the ratio of Fe II variation to luminosity variation) in the luminosity
rising stage is significantly greater than that in the decreasing stage, forming an evolutionary
trajectory of "$\Lambda$" shape. At the same luminosity, the Fe II strength in the decreasing stage
is significantly larger than that in the rising stage. This suggests that the amount of gas producing
Fe II in the decreasing stage is larger than that in the rising stage. Therefore we propose a scenario
that the dust at torus inner radius gradually sublimates into gas as the central luminosity increases.
During this process, the irons released from the sublimated dust contribute evidently to the Fe
II emission. Combined with the weak response of $\rm H\beta$, this scenario naturally explains
the positive correlation between the relative Fe II strength and Eddington ratio. Our result also
reveals a potential application of the Fe II emission in outburst events of AGNs: since the Fe II emission
is launched from the evaporated dust at inner radius (related to the central luminosity, i.e., $R_{\rm
sub}\propto L^{1/2}$) of torus, the Fe II time lag-luminosity relation can be adopted as a "standard
candle" candidate in cosmology.

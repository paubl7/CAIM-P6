The ionization feedback from HII regions modifies the properties of high-mass starless clumps
(HMSCs, of several hundred to a few thousand solar masses with a size of ~0.1-1 pc), such as temperature
and turbulence, on the clump scale. The question of whether the presence of HII regions modifies
the core-scale fragmentation and star formation in HMSCs remains to be explored. We aim to investigate
the difference of 0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between candidate HMSCs that are strongly impacted
by HII regions and less disturbed ones. We also search for evidence of mass shaping and induced star
formation in the impacted HMSCs. Using the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum with a resolution of ~1.3", we imaged
eight candidate HMSCs, including four impacted by HII regions and another four situated in the quiet
environment. The less-impacted HMSCs are selected on the basis of their similar mass and distance
compared to the impacted ones to avoid any possible bias linked to these parameters. A total of 51
cores were detected in eight clumps, with three to nine cores for each clump. Within our limited sample,
we did not find a clear difference in the ~0.025 pc-scale fragmentation between impacted and non-impacted
HMSCs, even though HII regions seem to affect the spatial distribution of the fragmented cores.
Both types of HMSCs present a thermal fragmentation with two-level hierarchical features at the
clump thermal Jeans length ${\lambda_{J, clump}^{th}}$ and 0.3${\lambda_{J, clump}^{th}}$.
The ALMA emission morphology of the impacted HMSCs AGAL010.214-00.306 and AGAL018.931-00.029
sheds light on the capacities of HII regions to shape gas and dust in their surroundings and possibly
to trigger star formation at ~0.025 pc-scale in HMSCs. Future ALMA surveys covering a large number
of impacted HMSCs with high turbulence are needed to confirm the trend of fragmentation indicated
in this study.

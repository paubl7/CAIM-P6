Thanks to the release of the extraordinary EHT image of shadow attributed to the M87* supermassive
black hole (SMBH), we have a novel window to assess the validity of fundamental physics in the strong-field
regime. Motivated by this, we consider Johannsen \& Psaltis metric parameterized by mass, spin,
and an additional dimensionless hair parameter $\epsilon$. This parametric framework in the high
rotation regimes provides a well-behaved bed to the strong-gravity test of the no-hair theorem
(NHT) using the EHT data. Incorporating the $\epsilon$ into the standard Kerr spacetime enrich
it in the sense that, depending on setting the positive and negative values for that, we deal with
alternative compact objects: deformed Kerr naked singularity and Kerr BH solutions, respectively.
Shadows associated with these two possible solutions indicate that the deformation parameter
$\epsilon$ affects the geometry shape of standard shadow such that it becomes more oblate and prolate
with $\epsilon<0$ and $\epsilon>0$, respectively. By scanning the window associated with three
shadow observables oblateness, deviation from circularity, and shadow diameter, we perform a
numerical analysis within the range $a_*=0.9\mp0.1$ of the dimensionless rotation parameter,
to find the constraints on the hair parameter $\epsilon$ in both possible solutions. For both possible
signs of $\epsilon$, we extract a variety of upper bounds that are in interplay with $a_*$. Although
by approaching the rotation parameters to the extreme limit, the allowable range of both hair parameters
becomes narrower, the hairy Kerr BH solution is a more promising candidate to play the role of the
alternative compact object instead of the standard Kerr BH. The lack of tension between hairy Kerr
BH with the current observation of the EHT shadow of the M87* SMBH carries this message that there
is the possibility of NHT violation.

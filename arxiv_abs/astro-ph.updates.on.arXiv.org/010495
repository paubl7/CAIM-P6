The differences in the relationships between the physical parameters and the chemical-element
abundances in accreted globular star clusters and those formed inside the Galaxy have been investigated.
The information on the supposed formation sites of the clusters based on the Gaia~DR2 data is borrowed
from the literature. Those sources estimate the probability of belonging to the Galactic bulge
and disk, as well as to six known events of the merger of dwarf satellite galaxies with the Milky Way,
for 151~globular clusters. It is shown that all metal-poor ($\rm{[Fe/H]}<-1.0$) genetically
related globular clusters have high relative abundances of $\alpha$-elements. According to modern
views, since type II supernovae release more $\alpha$-elements into the interstellar medium with
increasing mass, it has been suggested that masses of type II supernovae in the Galaxy were greater
than in the accreted galaxies. It is proved that the clusters of the low-energy group, which were
considered accreted, are genetically related to a single protogalactic cloud, same as the unstratified
clusters UKS~1 and Liller~1, which most likely belong to the bulge. It is shown that not only the lower
but also the upper limits of the clusters' masses decrease with an increase in the average radius
of their orbits. The latter fact is explained by a decrease in the masses of emerging clusters with
a decrease in the masses of their host galaxies. It is demonstrated that an extremely multicomponent
stellar population is observed only in accreted globular clusters with an initial mass $>10^{6}M_{\odot}$.
It has been suggested that these clusters retained all the matter ejected by their evolved stars,
from which new generations of stars formed due to long evolution far from our Galaxy.

Aims: We present a detailed X-ray study of the recently discovered supernova remnant (SNR) G53.41+0.03
that follows up and further expands on the previous, limited analysis of archival data covering
a small portion of the SNR. Methods: With the new dedicated 70ks XMM-Newton observation we investigate
the morphological structure of the SNR in X-rays, search for a presence of a young neutron star and
characterise the plasma conditions in the selected regions by means of spectral fitting. Results:
The first full view of SNR G53.41+0.03 shows an X-ray emission region well aligned with the reported
half-shell radio morphology. We find three distinct regions of the remnant that vary in brightness
and hardness of the spectra, and are all best characterised by a hot plasma model in a non-equilibrium
ionisation state. Of the three regions, the brightest one contains the most mature plasma, with
ionisation age $\tau \approx 4\times10^{10}$s cm$^{-3}$ (where $\tau = n_e t$), a lower electron
temperature of kT$_\mathrm{e} \approx 1$ keV and the highest estimated gas density of n$_\mathrm{H}\approx
0.87$ cm$^{-3}$. The second, fainter but spectrally harder, region reveals a younger plasma ($\tau
\approx 1.7\times10^{10}$s cm$^{-3}$) with higher temperature (kT$_\mathrm{e} \approx 2$ keV)
and two to three times lower density (n$_\mathrm{H}\approx 0.34$ cm$^{-3}$). The third region
is very faint, but we identify spectroscopically the presence of a hot plasma.Employing several
methods for age estimation, we find the remnant to be $t \approx 1000-5000$ yrs old, confirming the
earlier reports of a relatively young age. The environment of the remnant also contains a number
of point sources, of which most are expected to be positioned in the foreground. Of the two point sources
in the geometrical centre of the remnant one is consistent with the characteristics of a young neutron
star.

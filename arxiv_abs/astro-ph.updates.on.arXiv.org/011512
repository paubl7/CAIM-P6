We present the second data release for the HI-MaNGA programme of HI follow-up observations for the
SDSS-IV MaNGA survey. This release contains HI measurements from 2135 Green Bank Telescope (GBT)
observations and an updated crossmatch of the SDSS-IV MaNGA sample with the ALFALFA survey. We combine
these data with MaNGA spectroscopic measurements to examine relationships between HI-to-stellar
mass ratio (M_HI/M_*) and average ISM/star formation properties probed by optical emission lines.
M_HI/M_* is very weakly correlated with the equivalent width of Halpha, implying a loose connection
between the instantaneous star formation rate and the HI reservoir, although the link between M_HI/M_*
and star formation strengthens when averaged even over only moderate timescales (~30 Myrs). Galaxies
with elevated HI depletion times have enhanced [OI]/Halpha and depressed Halpha surface brightness,
consistent with more HI residing in a diffuse and/or shock heated phase which is less capable of condensing
into molecular clouds. Of all optical lines, M_HI/M_* correlates most strongly with oxygen equivalent
width, EW(O), which is likely a result of the existing correlation between M_HI/M_* and gas-phase
metallicity. Residuals in the M_HI/M_*-EW(O) relation are again correlated with [OI]/Halpha
and Halpha surface brightness, suggesting they are also driven by variations in the fraction of
diffuse and/or shock-heated gas. We recover the strong anti-correlation between M_HI/M_* and
gas-phase metallicity seen in previous studies. We also find a positive relationship between M_HI/M_*
and [OI]/Halpha, independent of metallicity, which may suggest that higher fractions of diffuse
and/or shock heated gas are more prevalent in gas-rich galaxies.

We study the cosmology of the dark sector consisting of (ultra) light scalars. Since the scalar mass
is radiatively unstable, a special explanation is required to make the mass much smaller than the
UV scale. There are two well-known mechanisms for the origin of scalar mass. The scalar can be identified
as a pseudo-Goldstone boson, whose shift symmetry is explicitly broken by non-perturbative corrections,
like the axion. Alternatively, it can be identified as a composite particle like the glueball, whose
mass is limited by the confinement scale of the theory. In both cases, the scalar can be naturally
light, but interaction behavior is quite different. The lighter the axion (glueball), the weaker
(stronger) it interacts. We consider the dark axion whose shift symmetry is anomalously broken
by the hidden non-abelian gauge symmetry. After the confinement of the gauge group, the dark axion
and the dark glueball get masses and both form multicomponent dark matter. We carefully consider
the effects of energy flow from the dark gluons to the dark axions and derive the full equations of
motion for the background and the perturbed variables. The effect of the dark axion-dark gluon coupling
on the evolution of the entropy and the isocurvature perturbations is also clarified. Finally,
we discuss the gravo-thermal collapse of the glueball subcomponent dark matter after the halos
form, in order to explore the potential to contribute to the formation of seeds for the supermassive
black holes observed at high redshifts. With the simplified assumptions, the glueball subcomponent
dark matter with the mass of $0.01-0.1 {\rm MeV}$, and the axion main dark matter component with the
decay constant $f_a={\cal O}(10^{15}-10^{16}){\rm GeV}$, the mass of ${\cal O}(10^{-14}-10^{-18})\,{\rm
eV}$, can provide the hint on the origin of the supermassive black holes at high redshifts.

Investigating the dust heating mechanisms in galaxies provides a deeper understanding of how the
internal energy balance drives their evolution. Over the last decade, radiative transfer simulations
based on the Monte Carlo method have underlined the role of the various stellar populations heating
the diffuse dust. Beyond the expected heating through ongoing star formation, both older stellar
population (> 8Gyr) and even AGN can contribute energy to the infrared emission of diffuse dust.
Here, we examine how the radiation of an external heating source, like the less massive galaxy NGC5195,
in the M51 interacting system, could affect the heating of the diffuse dust of its parent galaxy,
NGC5194, and vice versa. To quantify the exchange of energy between the two galaxies we use SKIRT,
a state-of-the-art Monte Carlo radiative transfer code. In the interest of modelling, the assumed
centre-to-centre distance separation between the two galaxies is 10kpc. Our model reproduces
the global SED of the system, and it closely matches the observed images. In total, 40.7% of the intrinsic
stellar radiation of the combined system is absorbed by dust. Furthermore, we quantify the contribution
of the various dust heating sources in the system, and find that the young stellar population of NGC5194
is the predominant dust-heating agent, with a global heating fraction of 71.2%. Another 23% is provided
by the older stellar population of the same galaxy, while the remaining 5.8% has its origin in NGC5195.
Locally, we find that the regions of NGC5194 closer to NGC5195 are significantly affected by the
radiation field of the latter, with the absorbed energy fraction rising up to 38%. The contribution
of NGC5195 remains under the percentage level in the outskirts of the disc of NGC5194. This is the
first time that the heating of the diffuse dust by a companion galaxy is quantified in a nearby interacting
system.

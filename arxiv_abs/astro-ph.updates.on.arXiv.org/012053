We investigate clustering properties of dark matter halos and galaxies to search for optimal statistics
and scales where possible departures from general relativity (GR) could be found. We use large N-body
cosmological simulations to perform measurements based on the two-point correlation function
(2PCF) in GR and in selected modified gravity (MG) structure formation scenarios. As a test-bed,
we employ two popular beyond-GR models: $f(R)$ gravity and the normal branch of the Dvali-Gabadadze-Porrati
(nDGP) braneworld. We study a range of simulated halo and galaxy populations and reveal a noticeable
MG signal in the monopole and quadrupole moments of the redshift-space 2PCF, and in the so-called
clustering wedges. However, once expressed in terms of the linear distortion parameter, $\beta$,
the statistical significance of these signals largely diminishes due to a strong degeneracy between
MG-enhanced clustering and modified tracer bias. To circumvent this, we consider statistics less
dependent on the bias: relative clustering ratios. We generalize the monopole ratio proposed in
earlier work to multipole moments and clustering wedges, and introduce a new estimator of the $\beta$
parameter. The clustering ratios we extract foster noticeable differences between MG and GR models,
reaching a maximum deviation of 10\% at 2$\sigma$ significance for specific variants of $f(R)$
and nDGP. We show that such departures could be measured for $\beta$ if non-linear effects at intermediate
scales are correctly modeled. Our study indicates that the clustering ratios give great promise
to search for signatures of MG in the large-scale structure. We also find that the selection of an
optimal tracer sample depends on a particular statistics and gravity model to be considered.

Spectroscopic observations of massive $z>7$ galaxies selected to have extremely large [OIII]+H$\beta$
equivalent width (EW $\sim1500$ \r{A}) have recently revealed large Ly$\alpha$ detection rates,
in contrast to the weak emission seen in the general population. Why these systems are uniquely visible
in Ly$\alpha$ at redshifts where the IGM is likely significantly neutral is not clear. With the goal
of better understanding these results, we have begun a campaign with MMT and Magellan to measure
Ly$\alpha$ in galaxies with similar [OIII]+H$\beta$ EWs at $z\simeq2-3$. At these redshifts,
the IGM is highly ionized, allowing us to clearly disentangle how the Ly$\alpha$ properties depend
on the [OIII]+H$\beta$ EW. Here we present Ly$\alpha$ EWs of $49$ galaxies at $z=2.2-3.7$ with intense
[OIII]+H$\beta$ line emission (EW $=300-3000$ \r{A}). Our results demonstrate that strong Ly$\alpha$
emission (EW $>20$ \r{A}) becomes more common in galaxies with larger [OIII]+H$\beta$ EW, reflecting
a combination of increasingly efficient ionizing photon production and enhanced transmission
of Ly$\alpha$. Among the galaxies with the most extreme [OIII]+H$\beta$ emission (EW $\sim1500$
\r{A}), we find that strong Ly$\alpha$ emission is not ubiquitous, with only $50\%$ of our population
showing Ly$\alpha$ EW $>20$ \r{A}. Our data suggest that the range of Ly$\alpha$ strengths is related
to the observed ellipticity, with those systems that appear edge-on or elongated having weaker
Ly$\alpha$ emission. We use these results to interpret the anomalous Ly$\alpha$ properties seen
in $z>7$ galaxies with extreme [OIII]+H$\beta$ emission and discuss implications for the escape
of ionizing radiation from these extreme line emitting galaxies.

The growing amount of integral-field spectroscopic data creates an increased demand for understanding
kinematic peculiarities that carry valuable information about the evolution of the host galaxies.
For kinematically distinct cores (KDCs), a number of formation mechanisms have been proposed,
but it is still unclear which of them commonly occur in the Universe. We aim to address the KDC formation
in the cosmological context. We used the publicly available data of the large-scale hydrodynamic
cosmological simulation Illustris. We identify 134 KDCs, study their properties, and follow their
evolution back in time. Examples of four galaxies hosting KDCs are presented and described in detail.
The masses of the KDC hosts follow the general distribution of the Illustris galaxies, with a possible
slight preference towards massive galaxies. KDCs can be long-lived features, with their formation
epochs roughly uniformly distributed in look-back times 0-11.4 Gyr, and they can survive even major
or multiple subsequent mergers. There is no single channel of KDC formation, but mergers seem to
be the formation mechanism for about 60% of KDCs with a significant preference for major mergers
and with the percentage being higher among massive hosts. Other KDCs formed during a pericentric
passage or flyby of another galaxy, by precession of a previously formed rapidly rotating core,
or without an obvious external cause. The mean mass-weighted stellar age inside the KDC radius is
either about the same as the look-back time of the KDC formation or older. Although the radii of our
KDCs are on average larger than observed, we find that younger stellar ages are typically associated
with smaller KDCs. A significant fraction of KDC hosts possess stellar shells formed during mergers
that led to KDCs within the last 5 Gyr, or double peaks in their velocity dispersion maps.

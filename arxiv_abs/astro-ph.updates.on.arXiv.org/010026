We report the discovery and characterisation of a super-Earth and a sub-Neptune transiting the
bright ($K=8.8$), quiet, and nearby (37 pc) M3V dwarf TOI-1266. We validate the planetary nature
of TOI-1266 b and c using four sectors of TESS photometry and data from the newly-commissioned 1-m
SAINT-EX telescope located in San Pedro M\'artir (Mexico). We also include additional ground-based
follow-up photometry as well as high-resolution spectroscopy and high-angular imaging observations.
The inner, larger planet has a radius of $R=2.37_{-0.12}^{+0.16}$ R$_{\oplus}$ and an orbital
period of 10.9 days. The outer, smaller planet has a radius of $R=1.56_{-0.13}^{+0.15}$ R$_{\oplus}$
on an 18.8-day orbit. The data are found to be consistent with circular, co-planar and stable orbits
that are weakly influenced by the 2:1 mean motion resonance. Our TTV analysis of the combined dataset
enables model-independent constraints on the masses and eccentricities of the planets. We find
planetary masses of $M_\mathrm{p}$ = $13.5_{-9.0}^{+11.0}$ $\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$ ($<36.8$
$\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$ at 2-$\sigma$) for TOI-1266 b and $2.2_{-1.5}^{+2.0}$ $\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$
($<5.7$ $\mathrm{M_{\oplus}}$ at 2-$\sigma$) for TOI-1266 c. We find small but non-zero orbital
eccentricities of $0.09_{-0.05}^{+0.06}$ ($<0.21$ at 2-$\sigma$) for TOI-1266 b and $0.04\pm0.03$
($<0.10$ at 2-$\sigma$) for TOI-1266 c. The equilibrium temperatures of both planets are of $413\pm20$
K and $344\pm16$ K, respectively, assuming a null Bond albedo and uniform heat redistribution from
the day-side to the night-side hemisphere. The host brightness and negligible activity combined
with the planetary system architecture and favourable planet-to-star radii ratios makes TOI-1266
an exquisite system for a detailed characterisation.

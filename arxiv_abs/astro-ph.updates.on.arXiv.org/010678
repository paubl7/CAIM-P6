We present visible and mid-infrared imagery and photometry of Jovian co-orbital comet P/2019 LD$_2$
(ATLAS) taken with Hubble Space Telescope/WFC3 on 2020 April 1, Spitzer Space Telescope/IRAC on
2020 January 25, Zwicky Transient Facility between 2019 April 9 and 2019 Nov 8 and the GROWTH telescope
network from 2020 May to July, as well as visible spectroscopy from Keck/LRIS on 2020 August 19. Our
observations indicate that LD$_2$ has a nucleus with radius 0.2-1.8 km assuming a 0.08 albedo and
that the coma is dominated by $\sim$100 $\mu$ m-scale dust ejected at $\sim$1 m/s speeds with a $\sim$1''
jet pointing in the SW direction. LD$_2$ experienced a total dust mass loss of $\sim$10$^8$ kg and
dust mass loss rate of $\sim$6 kg/s with Af$\rho$/cross-section varying between $\sim$85 cm/125
km$^2$ and $\sim$200 cm/310 km$^2$ between 2019 April 9 and 2019 Nov 8. If the Af$\rho$/cross-section
increase remained constant, it implies that LD$_2$ has remained active since $\sim$2018 November
when it came within 4.8 au of the Sun, a typical distance for comets to begin sublimation of H$_2$O.
From our 4.5 $\mu$m Spitzer observations, we set a limit on CO/CO$_2$ gas production of $\sim$10$^{27}$/$\sim$10$^{26}$
mol/s. Multiple bandpass photometry of LD$_2$ taken by the GROWTH network measured in a 10,000 km
aperture provide color measurements of $g$-$r$ = 0.59$\pm$0.03, $r$-$i$ = 0.18$\pm$0.05, and
$i$-$z$ = 0.01$\pm$0.07, colors typical of comets. We set a spectroscopic upper limit to the production
of H$_2$O gas of $\sim$80 kg/s. Improving the orbital solution for LD$_2$ with our observations,
we determine that the long-term orbit of LD$_2$ is that of a typical Jupiter Family Comet having close
encounters with Jupiter coming within $\sim$0.5 Hill radius in the last $\sim$3 y to within 0.8 Hill
radius in $\sim$9 y and has a 95$\%$ chance of being ejected from the Solar System in $<$ 10 Myr.

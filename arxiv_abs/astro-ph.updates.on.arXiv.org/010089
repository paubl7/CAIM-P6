I have reanalyzed the data obtained for local ($z<0.15$) star-forming galaxies during the pilot
survey for the Hobby-Eberly Telescope Dark Energy Experiment (HETDEX)---called the HETDEX Pilot
Survey (HPS)---which uses an integral-field-unit spectrograph and covers $\sim3500-5800$ $\unicode{x212B}$
at $\sim5$ $\unicode{x212B}$ resolution. I have newly determined the gas metallicities, $12 +
\text{log(O/H)}$, following the Bayesian analysis scheme of the previous study, but dealing carefully
with the uncertainty of strong-line calibration, performing reproducibility tests with mock
data, and monitoring the convergence of the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. From the
mock-data tests, I found that the nebular emission-line color excess $E(B-V)$ can be overestimated
by as much as 2-$\sigma$ or more, although the metallicity can recover the input value to within 1-$\sigma$.
The new metallicity estimates on the HPS data are from well-converged MCMC samples (effective sample
sizes $>$ 2000), and they are higher than the previous estimates by $\sim$2-$\sigma$. Using the
HPS data, I also showed that the MCMC sampling can have the statistical accuracy as poor as the one
near the iteration start if done without convergence monitoring. The overestimation of $E(B-V)$
indicates the overestimation of the star-formation rates (SFRs) in the previous study, which can
be as much as a factor of five. This finding undermines the previous suggestion of a hitherto-unknown
galaxy population based on the locations of galaxies in the mass-SFR plane. I found that the independent
determination of $E(B-V)$ using either H${\beta}$-H${\gamma}$ or H${\alpha}$-H${\beta}$ line
pair is ideal for the analysis of forthcoming HETDEX data, but it requires additional cost.

Context: The $\chi^{1}$ Fornacis cluster (Alessi 13) is one of a few open clusters of its age and distance
in the Solar neighbourhood that ought to benefit from more attention as it can serve as a cornerstone
for numerous future studies related to star and planet formation. Aims: We take advantage of the
early installment of the third data release of the Gaia space mission in combination with archival
data and our own observations, to expand the census of cluster members and revisit some properties
of the cluster. Methods: We applied a probabilistic method to infer membership probabilities over
a field of more than 1000 deg${^2}$ to select the most likely cluster members and derive the distances,
spatial velocities, and physical properties of the stars in this sample. Results: We identify 164
high-probability cluster members (including 61 new members) covering the magnitude range from
5.1 to 19.6 mag in the G-band. Our sample of cluster members is complete down to 0.04 M$_{\odot}$.
We derive the distance of $108.4\pm0.3$ pc from Bayesian inference and confirm that the cluster
is comoving with the Tucana-Horologium, Columba, and Carina young stellar associations. We investigate
the kinematics of the cluster from a subsample of stars with measured radial velocities and we do
not detect any significant expansion or rotation effects in the cluster. Our results suggest that
the cluster is somewhat younger (about 30 Myr) than previously thought. Based on spectroscopic
observations, we argue that the cluster is mass-segregated and that the distribution of spectral
types shows little variation compared to other young stellar groups. Conclusions: In this study,
we deliver the most complete census of cluster members that can be done with Gaia data alone and we
use this new sample to provide an updated picture on the 6D structure of the cluster.

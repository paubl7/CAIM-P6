Today, the majority of the cosmic baryons in the Universe are not observed directly, leading to an
issue of "missing baryons" at low redshift. Cosmological hydrodynamical simulations have indicated
that a significant portion of them will be converted into the so-called Warm-Hot Intergalactic
Medium (WHIM), with gas temperature ranging between 10$^5$-10$^7$K. While the cooler phase of
this gas has been observed using O VI and Ne VIII absorbers at UV wavelengths, the hotter fraction
detection relies mostly on observations of O VII and O VIII at X-ray wavelengths. Here, we target
the forbidden line of [Fe XXI] $\lambda$ 1354$\unicode{x212B}$ which traces 10$^7$K gas at UV wavelengths,
using more than one hundred high-spectral resolution (R$\sim$49,000) and high signal to noise
VLT/UVES quasar spectra, corresponding to over 600 hrs of VLT time observations. A stack of these
at the position of known DLAs lead to a 5-$\sigma$ limit of $\mathrm{log[N([Fe\,XXI])]<}$17.4
(${EW_{rest}<22}$m$\unicode{x212B}$), three orders of magnitude higher than the expected column
density of the WHIM $\mathrm{log[N([Fe\,XXI])]<}$14.5. This work proposes an alternative to
X-ray detected 10$^7$K WHIM tracers, by targeting faint lines at UV wavelengths from the ground
benefiting from higher instrumental throughput, enhanced spectral resolution, longer exposure
times and increased number of targets. The number of quasar spectra required to reach this theoretical
column density with future facilities including 4MOST, ELT/HIRES, MSE and the Spectroscopic Telescope
appears challenging at present. Probing the missing baryons is essential to constrain the accretion
and feedback processes which are fundamental to galaxy formation.

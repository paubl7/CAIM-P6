We perform a joint analysis of the counts of redMaPPer clusters selected from the Dark Energy Survey
(DES) Y1 data and multi-wavelength follow-up data collected within the 2500 deg$^2$ South Pole
Telescope (SPT) SZ survey. The SPT follow-up data, calibrating the richness--mass relation of
the optically selected redMaPPer catalog, enable the cosmological exploitation of the DES cluster
abundance data. To explore possible systematics related to the modeling of projection effects,
we consider two calibrations of the observational scatter on richness estimates: a simple Gaussian
model which account only for the background contamination (BKG), and a model which further includes
contamination and incompleteness due to projection effects (PRJ). Assuming either a $\Lambda$CDM+$\sum
m_\nu$ or $w$CDM+$\sum m_\nu$ cosmology, and for both scatter models, we derive cosmological constraints
consistent with multiple cosmological probes of the low and high redshift Universe, and in particular
with the SPT cluster abundance data. This result demonstrates that the DES Y1 and SPT cluster counts
provide consistent cosmological constraints, if the same mass calibration data set is adopted.
It thus supports the conclusion of the DES Y1 cluster cosmology analysis which interprets the tension
observed with other cosmological probes in terms of systematics affecting the stacked weak lensing
analysis of optically--selected low--richness clusters. Finally, we analyse the first combined
optically-SZ selected cluster catalogue obtained by including the SPT sample above the maximum
redshift probed by the DES Y1 redMaPPer sample. Besides providing a mild improvement of the cosmological
constraints, this data combination serves as a stricter test of our scatter models: the PRJ model,
providing scaling relations consistent between the two abundance and multi-wavelength follow-up
data, is favored over the BKG model.

The recent discovery of electromagnetic signals in coincidence with neutron-star mergers has
solidified the importance of multimessenger campaigns in studying the most energetic astrophysical
events. Pioneering multimessenger observatories, such as LIGO/Virgo and IceCube, record many
candidate signals below the detection significance threshold. These sub-threshold event candidates
are promising targets for multimessenger studies, as the information provided by them may, when
combined with contemporaneous gamma-ray observations, lead to significant detections. Here
we describe a new method that uses such candidates to search for transient events using archival
very-high-energy gamma-ray data from imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs). We demonstrate
the application of this method to sub-threshold binary neutron star (BNS) merger candidates identified
in Advanced LIGO's first observing run. We identify eight hours of archival VERITAS observations
coincident with seven BNS merger candidates and search them for TeV emission. No gamma-ray emission
is detected; we calculate upper limits on the integral flux and compare them to a short gamma-ray
burst model. We anticipate this search method to serve as a starting point for IACT searches with
future LIGO/Virgo data releases as well as in other sub-threshold studies for multimessenger transients,
such as IceCube neutrinos. Furthermore, it can be deployed immediately with other current-generation
IACTs, and has the potential for real-time use that places minimal burden on experimental operations.
Lastly, this method may serve as a pilot for studies with the Cherenkov Telescope Array, which has
the potential to observe even larger fields of view in its divergent pointing mode.

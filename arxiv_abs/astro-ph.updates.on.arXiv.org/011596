We report photometric and spectroscopic observations of the eclipsing SU UMa-type dwarf nova ASASSN-18aan.
We observed the 2018 superoutburst with 2.3 mag brightening and found the orbital period ($P_{\rm
orb}$) to be 0.149454(3) d, or 3.59 hr. This is longward of the period gap, establishing ASASSN-18aan
as one of a small number of long-$P_{\rm orb}$ SU UMa-type dwarf novae. The estimated mass ratio,
($q=M_2/M_1 = 0.278(1)$), is almost identical to the upper limit of tidal instability by the 3:1
resonance. From eclipses, we found that the accretion disk at the onset of the superoutburst may
reach the 3:1 resonance radius, suggesting that the superoutburst of ASASSN-18aan results from
the tidal instability. Considering the case of long-$P_{\rm orb}$ WZ Sge-type dwarf novae, we suggest
that the tidal dissipation at the tidal truncation radius is enough to induce SU UMa-like behavior
in relatively high-$q$ systems such as SU UMa-type dwarf novae, but that this is no longer effective
in low-$q$ systems such as WZ Sge-type dwarf novae. The unusual nature of the system extends to the
secondary star, for which we find a spectral type of G9, much earlier than typical for the orbital
period, and a secondary mass $M_2$ of around 0.18 M$_{\odot}$, smaller than expected for the orbital
period and the secondary's spectral type. We also see indications of enhanced sodium abundance
in the secondary's spectrum. Anomalously hot secondaries are seen in a modest number of other CVs
and related objects. These systems evidently underwent significant nuclear evolution before
the onset of mass transfer. In the case of ASASSN-18aan, this apparently resulted in a mass ratio
lower than typically found at the system's $P_{\rm orb}$, which may account for the occurrence of
a superoutburst at this relatively long period.

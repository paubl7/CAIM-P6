Strong gravitational lenses are a rare and instructive type of astronomical object. Identification
has long relied on serendipity, but different strategies -- such as mixed spectroscopy of multiple
galaxies along the line of sight, machine learning algorithms, and citizen science -- have been
employed to identify these objects as new imaging surveys become available. We report on the comparison
between spectroscopic, machine learning, and citizen science identification of galaxy-galaxy
lens candidates from independently constructed lens catalogs in the common survey area of the equatorial
fields of the GAMA survey. In these, we have the opportunity to compare high-completeness spectroscopic
identifications against high-fidelity imaging from the Kilo Degree Survey (KiDS) used for both
machine learning and citizen science lens searches. We find that the three methods -- spectroscopy,
machine learning, and citizen science -- identify 47, 47, and 13 candidates respectively in the
180 square degrees surveyed. These identifications barely overlap, with only two identified by
both citizen science and machine learning. We have traced this discrepancy to inherent differences
in the selection functions of each of the three methods, either within their parent samples (i.e.
citizen science focuses on low-redshift) or inherent to the method (i.e. machine learning is limited
by its training sample and prefers well-separated features, while spectroscopy requires sufficient
flux from lensed features to lie within the fiber). These differences manifest as separate samples
in estimated Einstein radius, lens stellar mass, and lens redshift. The combined sample implies
a lens candidate sky-density $\sim0.59$ deg$^{-2}$ and can inform the construction of a training
set spanning a wider mass-redshift space.

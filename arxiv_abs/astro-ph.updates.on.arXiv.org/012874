We map the likelihood of GW190521, the heaviest detected binary black hole (BBH) merger, by sampling
under different mass and spin priors designed to be uninformative. We find that a source-frame total
mass of $\sim$$150 M_{\odot}$ is consistently supported, but posteriors in mass ratio and spin
depend critically on the choice of priors. We confirm that the likelihood has a multi-modal structure
with peaks in regions of mass ratio representing very different astrophysical scenarios. The unequal-mass
region ($m_2 / m_1 < 0.3$) has an average likelihood $\sim$$e^6$ times larger than the equal-mass
region ($m_2 / m_1 > 0.3$) and a maximum likelihood $\sim$$e^2$ larger. Using ensembles of samples
across priors, we examine the implications of qualitatively different BBH sources that fit the
data. We find that the equal-mass solution has poorly constrained spins and at least one black hole
mass that is difficult to form via stellar collapse due to pair instability. The unequal-mass solution
can avoid this mass gap entirely but requires a negative effective spin and a precessing primary.
Either of these scenarios is more easily produced by dynamical formation channels than field binary
co-evolution. The sensitive comoving volume-time of the mass gap solution is $\mathcal{O}(10)$
times larger than the gap-avoiding solution. After accounting for this distance effect, the likelihood
still reverses the advantage to favor the gap-avoiding scenario by a factor of $\mathcal{O}(100)$
before considering mass and spin priors. Posteriors are easily driven away from this high-likelihood
region by common prior choices meant to be uninformative, making GW190521 parameter inference
sensitive to the assumed mass and spin distributions of mergers in the source's astrophysical channel.
This may be a generic issue for similarly heavy events given current detector sensitivity and waveform
degeneracies.

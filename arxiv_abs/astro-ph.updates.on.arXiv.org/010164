Identifying the most likely sources for high-energy neutrino emission has been one of the main topics
in high-energy astrophysics ever since the first observation of high-energy neutrinos by the IceCube
Neutrino Observatory. Active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets, blazars, have been considered
to be one of the main candidates due to their ability to accelerate particles to high energies. We
study the connection between radio emission and IceCube neutrino events using data from the Owens
Valley Radio Observatory and Mets\"ahovi Radio Observatory blazar monitoring programs. We identify
sources in our radio monitoring sample, which are positionally consistent with IceCube high-energy
neutrino events. We estimate their mean flux density and variability amplitudes around the neutrino
arrival time, and compare these with values from random samples to establish the significance of
our results.We find radio source associations within our samples with 16 high-energy neutrino
events detected by IceCube. Nearly half of the associated sources are not detected in the $\gamma$-ray
energies, but their radio variability properties and Doppler boosting factors are similar to the
$\gamma$-ray detected objects in our sample so that they could still be potential neutrino emitters.
We find that the number of strongly flaring objects in our samples is unlikely to occur due to a random
coincidence (at $2\sigma$ level), and in the case of OVRO samples, the sample of associated sources
is on average at an active state compared to random samples. Based on our results we conclude that
although it is clear that not all neutrino events are associated with strong radio flaring blazars,
when we see large amplitude radio flares in a blazar at the same time as a neutrino event, it is unlikely
to happen by random coincidence.

The reionization epoch concludes when ionizing photons reach every corner of the Universe. Reionization
has generally been assumed to be limited primarily by the rate at which galaxies produce ionizing
photons, but the recent measurement of a surprisingly short ionizing photon mean free path of $0.75^{+0.65}_{-0.45}$
proper Mpc at $z = 6$ by Becker et al. (2021) suggests that absorption by residual neutral hydrogen
in the otherwise ionized intergalactic medium may play a much larger role than previously expected.
Here we show that consistency between this short mean free path and the coeval dark pixel fraction
in the Ly$\alpha$ forest requires a cumulative output of $6.1^{+11}_{-2.4}$ ionizing photons
per baryon by reionization's end. This represents a dramatic increase in the ionizing photon budget
over previous estimates, greatly exacerbating the tension with measurements of the ionizing output
from galaxies at later times. Translating this constraint into the instantaneous ionizing production
from galaxies in our model, we find $\log_{10}f_{\rm esc}\xi_{\rm ion}/\text{(erg/Hz)}^{-1}
=25.02_{-0.21}^{+0.45}$ at $z\sim6$. Even with optimistic assumptions about the ionizing production
efficiency of early stellar populations, and assuming the galaxy luminosity function extends
to extremely faint sources ($M_{\text{UV}}\leq-11$), complete reionization requires the escape
fraction of ionizing photons to exceed $20\%$ across the galaxy population. This is far larger than
observed in any galaxy population at lower redshifts, requiring rapid evolution in galaxy properties
after the first billion years of cosmic time. This tension cannot be completely relieved within
existing observational constraints on the hydrogen neutral fraction and mean free path.

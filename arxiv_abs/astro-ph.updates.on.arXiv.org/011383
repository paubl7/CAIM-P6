The Hydrogen Intensity and Real-time Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX) is a planned interferometric
radio telescope array that will ultimately consist of 1024 close packed 6 m dishes that will be deployed
at the SKA South Africa site. HIRAX will survey the majority of the southern sky to measure baryon
acoustic oscillations (BAO) using the 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen. It will operate
between 400-800 MHz with 391 kHz resolution, corresponding to a redshift range of $0.8 < z < 2.5$ and
a minimum $\Delta z/z$ of ~0.003. One of the primary science goals of HIRAX is to constrain the dark
energy equation of state by measuring the BAO scale as a function of redshift over a cosmologically
significant range. Achieving this goal places stringent requirements on the mechanical and optical
design of the HIRAX instrument which are described in this paper. This includes the simulations
used to optimize the instrument, including the dish focal ratio, receiver support mechanism, and
instrument cabling. As a result of these simulations, the dish focal ratio has been reduced to 0.23
to reduce inter-dish crosstalk, the feed support mechanism has been redesigned as a wide (35 cm diam.)
central column, and the feed design has been modified to allow the cabling for the receiver to pass
directly along the symmetry axis of the feed and dish in order to eliminate beam asymmetries and reduce
sidelobe amplitudes. The beams from these full-instrument simulations are also used in an astrophysical
m-mode analysis pipeline which is used to evaluate cosmological constraints and determine potential
systematic contamination due to physical non-redundancies of the array elements. This end-to-end
simulation pipeline was used to inform the dish manufacturing and assembly specifications which
will guide the production and construction of the first-stage HIRAX 256-element array.

A pair of non-thermal radio bubbles recently discovered in the inner few hundred parsecs of the Galactic
center bears a close spatial association with elongated, thermal X-ray features called the X-ray
chimneys. While their morphology, position, and orientation vividly point to an outflow from the
Galactic center, the physical processes responsible for the outflow remain to be understood. We
use three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamic simulations to test the hypothesis that the radio
bubbles/X-ray chimneys are the manifestation of an energetic outflow driven by multiple core-collapsed
supernovae in the nuclear stellar disk, where numerous massive stars are known to be present. Our
simulations are run with different combinations of two main parameters, the supernova birth rate
and the strength of a global magnetic field being vertically oriented with respect to the disk. The
simulation results show that a hot gas outflow can naturally form and acquire a vertically elongated
shape due to collimation by the magnetic pressure. In particular, the simulation with an initial
magnetic field strength of 80 $\mu$G and a supernova rate of 1 $kyr^{-1}$ can well reproduce the observed
morphology, internal energy and X-ray luminosity of the bubbles after an evolutionary time of 330
kyr. On the other hand, a magnetic field strength of 200 $\mu$G gives rise to an overly elongated outflow
that is inconsistent with the observed bubbles. The simulations also reveal that, inside the bubbles,
mutual collisions between the shock waves of individual supernovae produce dense filaments of
locally amplified magnetic field. Such filaments may account for a fraction of the synchrotron-emitting
radio filaments known to exist in the Galactic center.

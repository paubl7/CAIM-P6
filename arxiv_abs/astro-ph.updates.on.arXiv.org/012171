The second LIGO-Virgo catalog of gravitational wave transients has more than quadrupled the observational
sample of binary black holes. We analyze this catalog using a suite of five state-of-the-art binary
black hole population models covering a range of isolated and dynamical formation channels and
infer branching fractions between channels as well as constraints on uncertain physical processes
that impact the observational properties of mergers. Given our set of formation models, we find
significant differences between the branching fractions of the underlying and detectable populations,
and that the diversity of detections suggests that multiple formation channels are at play. A mixture
of channels is strongly preferred over any single channel dominating the detected population:
an individual channel does not contribute to more than $\simeq 70\%$ of the observational sample
of binary black holes. We calculate the preference between the natal spin assumptions and common
envelope efficiencies in our models, favoring natal spins of isolated black holes of $\lesssim
0.1$, and marginally preferring common envelope efficiencies of $\gtrsim 2.0$ while strongly
disfavoring highly inefficient common envelopes. We show that it is essential to consider multiple
channels when interpreting gravitational wave catalogs, as inference on branching fractions
and physical prescriptions becomes biased when contributing formation scenarios are not considered
or incorrect physical prescriptions are assumed. Although our quantitative results can be affected
by uncertain assumptions in model predictions, our methodology is capable of including models
with updated theoretical considerations and additional formation channels.

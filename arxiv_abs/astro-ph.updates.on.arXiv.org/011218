We have analysed the asymmetry of lines Fe I and Fe II in spectra of a solar flux using three FTS atlases
and the HARPS atlas and also in spectra of 13 stars using observation data on the HARPS spectrograph.
To reduce observation noise individual line bisectors of each star have been averaged. The obtained
average bisectors in the stellar spectra are more or less similar to the shape C well known to the Sun.
In stars with rotation speeds greater than 5 km/s the shape of the bisectors is more like /. The curvature
and span of the bisectors increase with the temperature of the star. Our results confirm the known
facts about strong influence of rotation velocity on the span and shape of bisectors. The average
convective speed was determined based on the span of the average bisector, which shows the largest
difference between the velocity of cold falling and hot rising convective flows of the matter. It's
equal to -420 m/s for the Sun as a star. In solar-type stars, it grows from -150 to -700 m/s with an effective
temperature of 4800 to 6200 K, respectively. For stars with greater surface gravity and greater
metallicity, the average convective velocity decreases. It also decreases with star age and correlates
with the speed of micro and macroturbulent movements. The results of solar flux analysis showed
that absolute wavelength scales in the FTS atlases used coincide with an accuracy of about -10 m/s,
except for the atlas of Hinkle, etc., whose scale is shifted and depends on the wavelength. In the
range from 450 to 650 nm, the scale shift of this atlas varies from -100 to -330 m/s, respectively,
and it equals on average of -240 m/s. The resulting average star bisectors contain information about
the fields of convective velocities and may be useful for hydrodynamic modeling of stellar atmospheres
in order to study the characteristic features of surface convection.

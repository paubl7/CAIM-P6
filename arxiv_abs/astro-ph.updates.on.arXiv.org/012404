Investigations that were carried out over the last two decades with novel and more sensitive instrumentation
have dramatically improved our knowledge of the more violent physical processes taking place in
galactic and extra-galactic Black-Holes, Neutron Stars, Supernova Remnants/Pulsar Wind Nebulae,
and other regions of the Universe where relativistic acceleration processes are in place. Simultaneous
and/or combined observations with gamma-ray satellites and ground based high-energy telescopes,
have clarified the scenario of the mechanisms responsible for high energy photon emission by leptonic
and hadronic accelerated particles in the presence of magnetic fields. Specifically, the European
Space Agency INTEGRAL soft gamma-ray observatory has detected more than 1000 sources in the soft
gamma-ray band, providing accurate positions, light curves and time resolved spectral data for
them. Space observations with Fermi-LAT and observations that were carried out from the ground
with H.E.S.S., MAGIC, VERITAS, and other telescopes sensitive in the GeV-TeV domain have, at the
same time, provided evidence that a substantial fraction of the cosmic sources detected are emitting
in the keV to TeV band via Synchrotron-Inverse Compton processes, in particular from stellar galactic
BH systems as well as from distant black holes. In this work, employing a spatial cross correlation
technique, we compare the INTEGRAL/IBIS and TeV all-sky data in search of secure or likely associations.
Although this analysis is based on a subset of the INTEGRAL all-sky observations, we find that there
is a significant correlation: 39 objects show emission in both soft gamma-ray and TeV wavebands.
The full INTEGRAL database, now comprising almost 19 years of public data available, will represent
an important legacy that will be useful for the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) and other ground
based large projects.

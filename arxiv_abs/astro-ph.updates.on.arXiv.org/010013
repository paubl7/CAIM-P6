Feedback through energetic outflows has emerged as a key physical process responsible for transforming
star-forming galaxies into the quiescent systems observed in the local universe. To explore this
process, this paper focuses on a sample of massive and compact merger remnant galaxies hosting high-velocity
gaseous outflows ($|v| \gtrsim 10^{3}$ km s$^{-1}$), found at intermediate redshift ($z \sim 0.6$).
From their mid-infrared emission and compact morphologies, these galaxies are estimated to have
exceptionally large star formation rate (SFR) surface densities ($\Sigma_{SFR} \sim 10^{3}$
$\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ yr$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-2}$), approaching the Eddington limit for radiation
pressure on dust grains. This suggests that star formation feedback may be driving the observed
outflows. However, these SFR estimates suffer from significant uncertainties. We therefore sought
an independent tracer of star formation to probe the compact starburst activity in these systems.
In this paper, we present SFR estimates calculated using 1.5 GHz continuum Jansky Very Large Array
observations for 19 of these galaxies. We also present updated infrared (IR) SFRs calculated from
WISE survey data. We estimate SFRs from the IR to be larger than those from the radio for 16 out of 19
galaxies by a median factor of 2.5. We find that this deviation is maximized for the most compact galaxies
hosting the youngest stellar populations, suggesting that compact starbursts deviate from the
IR-radio correlation. We suggest that this deviation stems either from free-free absorption of
synchrotron emission, a difference in the timescale over which each indicator traces star formation,
or exceptionally hot IR-emitting dust in these ultra-dense galaxies.

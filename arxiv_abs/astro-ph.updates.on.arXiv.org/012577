We present a novel, physically-motivated sub-grid model for HII region feedback within the moving
mesh code Arepo, accounting for both the radiation pressure-driven and thermal expansion of the
ionised gas surrounding young stellar clusters. We apply this framework to isolated disc galaxy
simulations with mass resolutions between $10^3~{\rm M}_\odot$ and $10^5~{\rm M}_\odot$ per
gas cell. Each simulation accounts for the self-gravity of the gas, the momentum and thermal energy
from supernovae, the injection of mass by stellar winds, and the non-equilibrium chemistry of hydrogen,
carbon and oxygen. We reduce the resolution-dependence of our model by grouping those HII regions
with overlapping ionisation front radii. The Str\"{o}mgren radii of the grouped HII regions are
at best marginally-resolved, so that the injection of purely-thermal energy within these radii
has no effect on the interstellar medium. By contrast, the injection of momentum increases the fraction
of cold and molecular gas by more than 50 per cent at mass resolutions of $10^3~{\rm M}_\odot$, and
decreases its turbulent velocity dispersion by $\sim 10~{\rm kms}^{-1}$. The mass-loading of
galactic outflows is decreased by an order of magnitude. The characteristic lifetime of the least-massive
molecular clouds ($M/{\rm M}_\odot < 5.6 \times 10^4$) is reduced from $\sim 18$ Myr to $<10$ Myr,
indicating that HII region feedback is effective in destroying these clouds. Conversely, the lifetimes
of intermediate-mass clouds ($5.6 \times 10^4 < M/{\rm M}_\odot < 5 \times 10^5$) are elongated
by $\sim 7$ Myr, likely due to a reduction in supernova clustering. The derived cloud lifetimes span
the range from $10$-$40$ Myr, in agreement with observations. All results are independent of whether
the momentum is injected from a 'spherical' or a 'blister-type HII region.

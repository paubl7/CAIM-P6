Evolved low- to intermediate-mass stars are known to shed their gaseous envelope into a large, dusty,
molecule-rich circumstellar nebula which typically develops a high degree of structural complexity.
Most of the large-scale, spatially correlated structures in the nebula are thought to originate
from the interaction of the stellar wind with a companion. As part of the Atomium large programme,
we observed the M-type asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star R Hydrae with ALMA. The morphology of the
inner wind of R Hya, which has a known companion at ~3500 au, was determined from maps of CO and SiO obtained
at high angular resolution. A map of the CO emission reveals a multi-layered structure consisting
of a large elliptical feature at an angular scale of ~10'' that is oriented along the north-south
axis. The wind morphology within the elliptical feature is dominated by two hollow bubbles. The
bubbles are on opposite sides of the AGB star and lie along an axis with a position angle of ~115 deg.
Both bubbles are offset from the central star, and their appearance in the SiO channel maps indicates
that they might be shock waves travelling through the AGB wind. An estimate of the dynamical age of
the bubbles yields an age of the order of 100 yr, which is in agreement with the previously proposed
elapsed time since the star last underwent a thermal pulse. When the CO and SiO emission is examined
on subarcsecond angular scales, there is evidence for an inclined, differentially rotating equatorial
density enhancement, strongly suggesting the presence of a second nearby companion. The position
angle of the major axis of this disc is ~70 deg in the plane of the sky. We tentatively estimate that
a lower limit on the mass of the nearby companion is ~0.65 Msol on the basis of the highest measured
speeds in the disc and the location of its inner rim at ~6 au from the AGB star.

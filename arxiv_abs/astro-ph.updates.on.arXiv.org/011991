Radial-velocity follow-up of stars harbouring transiting planets detected by TESS is expected
to require very large amounts of expensive telescope time in the next few years. Therefore, scheduling
strategies should be implemented to maximize the amount of information gathered about the target
planetary systems. We consider myopic and non-myopic versions of a novel uniform-in-phase scheduler,
as well as a random scheduler, and compare these scheduling strategies with respect to the bias,
accuracy and precision achieved in recovering the mass and orbital parameters of transiting and
non-transiting planets. This comparison is carried out based on realistic simulations of radial-velocity
follow-up with ESPRESSO of a sample of 50 TESS target stars, with simulated planetary systems containing
at least one transiting planet with a radius below $4R_{\oplus}$. Radial-velocity datasets were
generated under reasonable assumptions about their noise component, including that resulting
from stellar activity, and analysed using a fully Bayesian methodology. We find the random scheduler
leads to a more biased, less accurate, and less precise, estimation of the mass of the transiting
exoplanets. No significant differences are found between the results of the myopic and non-myopic
implementations of the uniform-in-phase scheduler. With only about 22 radial velocity measurements
per dataset, our novel uniform-in-phase scheduler enables an unbiased (at the level of 1\%) measurement
of the masses of the transiting planets, while keeping the average relative accuracy and precision
around 16\% and 23\% respectively. The number of non-transiting planets detected is similar for
all the scheduling strategies considered, as well as the bias, accuracy and precision with which
their masses and orbital parameters are recovered.

We present the first results from SPHINX-MHD, a suite of cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamics
simulations designed to study the impact of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) on galaxy formation
and the evolution of the intergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization. The simulations
are among the first to employ on-the-fly radiation transfer and constrained transport ideal MHD
in a cosmological context to simultaneously model the inhomogeneous process of reionization and
the growth of PMFs. We run a series of $(5{\rm Mpc})^3$ cosmological volumes, varying both the strength
of the seed magnetic field and its spectral index. We find that PMFs with a spectral index ($n_B$)
and a comoving amplitude ($B_0$) that have $n_B>-0.562\log_{10}(B_0/1{\rm n}G) - 3.35$ produce
electron optical depths ($\tau_e$) that are inconsistent with CMB constraints due to the unrealistically
early collapse of low-mass dwarf galaxies. For $n_B\geq-2.9$, our constraints are considerably
tighter than the $\sim{\rm n}G$ constraints from Planck. PMFs that do not satisfy our constraints
have little impact on the reionization history or the shape of the UV luminosity function. Likewise,
detecting changes in the Ly$\alpha$ forest due to PMFs will be challenging because photoionisation
and photoheating efficiently smooth the density field. However, we find that the first absorption
feature in the global 21cm signal is a particularly sensitive indicator of the properties of the
PMFs, even for those that satisfy our $\tau_e$ constraint. Furthermore, strong PMFs can increase
the escape of LyC photons by up to 25% and shrink the effective radii of galaxies by 44% which could
increase the completeness fraction of galaxy surveys. Finally, our simulations show that surveys
with a magnitude limit of ${\rm M_{UV,1500{\rm A}}=-13}$ can probe the sources that provide the
50% of photons for reionization out to $z=12$.

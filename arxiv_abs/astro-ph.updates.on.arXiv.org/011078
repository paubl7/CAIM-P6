Aims. Interacting galaxies show unique irregularities in their kinematic structure. By investigating
the spatially resolved kinematics and stellar population properties of galaxies that show irregularities,
we can paint a detailed picture of the formation and evolutionary processes that took place during
its lifetimes. Methods. In this work, we focus on galaxies with a specific kinematic irregularity,
a kinematically distinct stellar core (KDC), in particular, counter-rotating galaxies where
the core and main body of the galaxy are rotating in opposite directions. We visually identify eleven
MaNGA galaxies with a KDC from their stellar kinematics, and investigate their spatially resolved
stellar and gaseous kinematic properties, namely the two-dimensional stellar and gaseous velocity
and velocity dispersion ({\sigma}) maps. Additionally, we examine the stellar population properties,
as well as spatially resolved recent star formation histories using the Dn4000 and H{\delta} gradients.
Results. The galaxies display multiple off-centred, symmetrical peaks in the stellar {\sigma}
maps. The gaseous velocity and {\sigma} maps display regular properties. The stellar population
properties and their respective gradients show differing properties depending on the results
of the spatially resolved emission line diagnostics of the galaxies, with some galaxies showing
inside-out quenching but others not. The star formation histories also largely differ based on
the spatially resolved emission line diagnostics, but most galaxies show indications of recent
star formation either in their outskirts or core. Conclusions. We find a distinct difference in
kinematic and stellar population properties in galaxies with a counter-rotating stellar core,
depending on its classification using spatially resolved emission line diagnostics.

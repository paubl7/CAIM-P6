We analyze the rest-optical emission-line ratios of z~1.5 galaxies drawn from the MOSDEF survey.
Based on composite spectra we investigate the mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at z~1.5 and measure
its evolution to z=0. When using gas-phase metallicities based on the N2 line ratio, we find that
the difference between the MZR at z~1.5 and z=0 depends on stellar mass, with a difference of $\Delta\rm
log(\rm O/H)\sim0.25$ dex at $M_* <10^{9.75}M_{\odot}$ down to $\Delta\rm log(\rm O/H)\sim0.05$
for galaxies with $M_*>10^{10.5}M_{\odot}$. In contrast, the O3N2-based MZR shows a constant
offset of $\Delta\rm log(\rm O/H)\sim0.30$ for all masses, consistent with previous MOSDEF results
based on independent metallicity indicators, and suggesting that O3N2 provides a more robust metallicity
calibration for our z~1.5 sample. We investigated the secondary dependence of the MZR on SFR by measuring
correlated scatter about the mean $M_*$-sSFR and $M_*-\log(\rm O3N2)$ relations. We find an anti-correlation
between $\log(\rm O/H)$ and sSFR offsets, indicating the presence of a $M_*$-SFR-Z relation, though
with limited significance. Additionally, we find that our z~1.5 stacks lie along the z=0 metallicity
sequence at fixed $\mu=\log(M_*/M_{\odot})-0.6\times\log(\rm SFR/M_{\odot}yr^{-1})$, suggesting
that the z~1.5 stacks can be described by the z=0 fundamental metallicity relation (FMR). However,
using different calibrations can shift the metallicities enough to be inconsistent with the local
FMR, indicating that the choice of calibration is essential for understanding metallicity evolution
with redshift. Finally, understanding how [NII]/H$\alpha$ scales with galaxy properties is crucial
for describing the effects of blended [NII] and H$\alpha$ on redshift and H$\alpha$ flux measurements
in future large surveys utilizing low-resolution spectra such as with Euclid and the Roman Space
Telescope.

A number of transiting, potentially habitable Earth-sized exoplanets have recently been detected
around several nearby M dwarf stars. These worlds represent important targets for atmospheric
characterization for the upcoming NASA James Webb Space Telescope. Given that available time for
exoplanet characterization will be limited, it is critically important to first understand the
capabilities and limitations of JWST when attempting to detect atmospheric constituents for potentially
Earth-like worlds orbiting cool stars. Here, we explore coupled climate-chemistry atmospheric
models for Earth-like planets orbiting a grid of M dwarf hosts. Using a newly-developed and validated
JWST instrument model - the JWST Exoplanet Transit Simulator (JETS) - we investigate the detectability
of key biosignature and habitability indicator gaseous species for a variety of relevant instruments
and observing modes. Spectrally-resolved detection scenarios as well as cases where the spectral
impact of a given species is integrated across the entire range of an instrument/mode are considered
and serve to highlight the importance of considering information gained over an entire observable
spectral range. When considering the entire spectral coverage of an instrument/mode, detections
of methane, carbon dioxide, oxygen and water at signal-to-noise ratio 5 could be achieved with observations
of several tens of transits (or less) for cloud-free Earth-like worlds orbiting mid- to late-type
M dwarfs at system distances of up to 10-15 pc. When compared to previous results, requisite exposure
times for gas species detection depend on approaches to quantifying the spectral impact of the species
as well as underlying photochemical model assumptions. Thus, constraints on atmospheric abundances,
even if just upper limits, by JWST have the potential to further our understanding of terrestrial
atmospheric chemistry.

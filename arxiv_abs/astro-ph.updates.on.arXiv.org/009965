We present the study of the south-west group in the Fornax cluster centred on the brightest group
galaxy (BGG) Fornax A, observed as part of the Fornax Deep Survey (FDS). This includes the analysis
of the bright group members (mB < 16 mag) and the intra-group light (IGL). The main objective of this
work is to investigate the assembly history of the Fornax A group and to compare its physical quantities
as a function of the environment to that of the Fornax cluster core. For all galaxies, we extract the
azimuthally averaged surface brightness profiles in three optical bands (g, r, i) by modelling
the galaxy's isophotes. We derive their colour profiles and structural parameters in all respective
bands. The long integration time and large covered area of the FDS allow us to also estimate the amount
of IGL. The majority of galaxies in the Fornax A group are late-type galaxies (LTGs), spanning a range
of stellar mass of $8 < log (M_* M_{\odot}) < 10.5$. Six out of nine LTGs show a Type III (up-bending)
break in their light profiles, which is either suggestive of strangulation halting star-formation
in their outskirts or their HI-richness causing enhanced star-formation in their outer-discs.
The estimated luminosity of the IGL is $6 \pm 2 \times 10^{10} L_{\odot}$ in g-band, which corresponds
to about 16% of the total light in the group. The Fornax A group appears to be in an early stage of assembly
with respect to the cluster core. The environment of the Fornax A group is not as dense as that of the
cluster core, with all galaxies except the BGG showing similar morphology, comparable colours
and stellar masses, and Type III disc-breaks, without any clear trend of these properties with group-centric
distances. The main contribution to the IGL is from the minor merging in the outskirts of the BGG NGC1316
and, probably, the disrupted dwarf galaxies close to the group centre.

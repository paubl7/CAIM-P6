Recent measurements of rotation periods ($P_\text{rot}$) in the benchmark open clusters Praesepe
(670 Myr), NGC 6811 (1 Gyr), and NGC 752 (1.4 Gyr) demonstrate that, after converging onto a tight
sequence of slowly rotating stars in mass$-$period space, stars temporarily stop spinning down.
These data also show that the duration of this epoch of stalled spin-down increases toward lower
masses. To determine when stalled stars resume spinning down, we use data from the $K2$ mission and
the Palomar Transient Factory to measure $P_\text{rot}$ for 58 dwarf members of the 2.7-Gyr-old
cluster Ruprecht 147, 39 of which satisfy our criteria designed to remove short-period or near-equal-mass
binaries. Combined with the $Kepler$ $P_\text{rot}$ data for the approximately coeval cluster
NGC 6819 (30 stars with $M_\star > 0.85$ M$_\odot$), our new measurements more than double the number
of $\approx$2.5 Gyr benchmark rotators and extend this sample down to $\approx$0.55 M$_\odot$.
The slowly rotating sequence for this joint sample appears relatively flat (22 $\pm$ 2 days) compared
to sequences for younger clusters. This sequence also intersects the $Kepler$ intermediate period
gap, demonstrating that this gap was not created by a lull in star formation. We calculate the time
at which stars resume spinning down, and find that 0.55 M$_\odot$ stars remain stalled for at least
1.3 Gyr. To accurately age-date low-mass stars in the field, gyrochronology formulae must be modified
to account for this stalling timescale. Empirically tuning a core$-$envelope coupling model with
open cluster data can account for most of the apparent stalling effect. However, alternative explanations,
e.g., a temporary reduction in the magnetic braking torque, cannot yet be ruled out.

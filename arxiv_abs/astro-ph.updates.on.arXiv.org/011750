We relate the fundamental quadrupolar fluid mode of isolated non-rotating NSs and the dominant
oscillation frequency of neutron star merger remnants. Both frequencies individually are known
to correlate with certain stellar parameters like radii or the tidal deformability, which we further
investigate by constructing fit formulae and quantifying the scatter of the data points from those
relations. Furthermore, we compare how individual data points deviate from the corresponding
fit to all data points. Considering this point-to-point scatter we uncover a striking similarity
between the frequency deviations of perturbative data for isolated NSs and of oscillation frequencies
of rapidly rotating, hot, massive merger remnants. The correspondence of frequency deviations
in these very different stellar systems points to an underlying mechanism and EoS information being
encoded in the frequency deviation. We trace the frequency scatter back to deviations of the tidal
Love number from an average tidal Love number for a given stellar compactness. Our results thus indicate
a possibility to break the degeneracy between NS radii, tidal deformability and tidal Love number.
We also relate frequency deviations to the derivative of the tidal deformability with respect to
mass. Our findings generally highlight a possibility to improve GW asteroseismology relations
where the systematic behavior of frequency deviations is employed to reduce the scatter in such
relationships and consequently increase the measurement accuracy. In addition, we relate the
f-mode frequency of static stars and the dominant GW frequency of merger remnants. We find an analytic
mapping to connect the masses of both stellar systems, which yields particularly accurate mass-independent
relations between both frequencies and between the postmerger frequency and the tidal deformability.

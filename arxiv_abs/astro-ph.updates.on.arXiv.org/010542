B-fields are predicted to play a role in the formation of filamentary structures and their fragmentation
process. We aim at investigating the role of the B-field in the process of core fragmentation toward
the hub-filament systems in the IRDC G14.2, which present different fragmentation level. We performed
observations of the thermal dust polarization at 350 {\mu}m using the CSO toward the hubs. We applied
the polarization--intensity-gradient method to estimate the significance of the B-field over
the G-force. The B-field in Hub-N shows a uniform structure along the E-W orientation, perpendicular
to the major axis of the hub-filament system. The I-gradient in Hub-N displays a local minimum coinciding
with the dust core MM1a detected with interferometric observations. The B-field orientation is
perturbed when approaching the dust core. Hub-S shows 2 local minima, reflecting the bimodal distribution
of the B-field. In Hub-N, both E and W of the hub-filament system, the I-gradient and the B-field are
parallel whereas they tend to be perpendicular when penetrating the filaments and hub. The analysis
of the {\delta}- and {\Sigma} B-maps indicate that, the B-field cannot prevent the collapse, suggesting
that the B-field is initially dragged by the infalling motion and aligned with it, or is channeling
material toward the central ridge from both sides. Values of {\Sigma} B > 1 are found toward a N-S ridge
encompassing the dust emission peak, indicating that in this region B-field dominates over G-force,
or that with the current angular resolution we cannot resolve an hypothetical more complex structure.
We estimated the B-field strength, the MtF ratio and the A-M number, and found differences between
the 2 hubs. The different levels of fragmentation observed in these 2 hubs could arise from the differences
in the B-field properties rather than from different intensity of the G-field.

Publications in astrophysics are nowadays mainly published and read in digitized formats. Astrophysical
publications in both research and in popular outreach often use colorful representations of stars
to indicate various stellar types, that is, different spectral types or effective temperatures.
Computer generated and computer displayed imagery has become an integral part of stellar astrophysics
communication. There is, however, no astrophysically motivated standard color palette for illustrative
representations of stars and some stars are actually represented in misleading colors. We use pre-computed
PHOENIX and TLUSTY stellar model spectra and convolve them with the three standard color matching
functions for human color perception between 360$\,$nm and 830$\,$nm. The color matching functions
represent the three sets of receptors in the eye that respond to red, green, and blue light. For a grid
of main sequence stars with effective temperatures between 2300$\,$K and 55,000$\,$K of different
metallicities we present the red-blue-green and hexadecimal color codes that can be used for digitized
color representations of stars as if seen from space. We find significant deviations between the
color codes of stars computed from stellar spectra and from a black body radiator of the same effective
temperature. We illustrate the main sequence in the color wheel and demonstrate that there are no
yellow, green, cyan, or purple stars. Red dwarf stars (spectral types M0V - M9V) actually look orange
to the human eye. Old white dwarfs such as WD$\,$1856$+$534, host to a newly discovered transiting
giant planet candidate, occur pale orange to the human eye, not white. Our freely available software
can be used to generate color codes for any input spectrum such as those from planets, galaxies, quasars
etc.

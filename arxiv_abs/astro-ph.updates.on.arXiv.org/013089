We study the weak mixing of photons and relativistic axion-like particles (axions) in plasmas with
background magnetic fields, ${\bf B}$. We show that, to leading order in the axion-photon coupling,
the conversion probability, $P_{\gamma \to a}$, is given by the one-dimensional power spectrum
of the magnetic field components perpendicular to the particle trajectory. Equivalently, we express
$P_{\gamma \to a}$ as the Fourier transform of the magnetic field autocorrelation function, and
establish a dictionary between properties of the real-space magnetic field and the energy-dependent
conversion probability. For axions more massive than the plasma frequency, ($m_a>\omega_{\rm
pl}$), we use this formalism to analytically solve the problem of perturbative axion-photon mixing
in a general magnetic field. In the general case where $m_a/\omega_{\rm pl}$ varies arbitrarily
along the trajectory, we show that a naive application of the standard formalism for resonant conversion
can give highly inaccurate results, and that a careful calculation generically gives non-resonant
contributions at least as large as the resonant contribution. Furthermore, we demonstrate how
techniques based on the Fast Fourier Transform provide a new, highly efficient numerical method
for calculating axion-photon mixing. We briefly discuss magnetic field modelling in galaxy clusters
in the light of our results and argue, in particular, that a recently proposed regular model used
for studying axion-photon mixing (specifically applied to the Perseus cluster) is inconsistent
with observations. Our formalism suggest new methods to search for imprints of axions, and will
be important for spectrographs with percent level sensitivity, which includes existing X-ray
observations by Chandra as well as the upcoming Athena mission.

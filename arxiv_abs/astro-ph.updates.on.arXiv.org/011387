Coronal jets are ubiquitous in active regions (ARs) and coronal holes. In this paper, we study a coronal
jet related to a C3.4 circular-ribbon flare in active region 12434 on 2015 October 16. Two minifilaments
were located under a 3D fan-spine structure before flare. The flare was generated by the eruption
of one filament. The kinetic evolution of the jet was divided into two phases: a slow rise phase at
a speed of $\sim$131 km s$^{-1}$ and a fast rise phase at a speed of $\sim$363 km s$^{-1}$ in the plane-of-sky.
The slow rise phase may correspond to the impulsive reconnection at the breakout current sheet.
The fast rise phase may correspond to magnetic reconnection at the flare current sheet. The transition
between the two phases occurred at $\sim$09:00:40 UT. The blueshifted Doppler velocities of the
jet in the Si {\sc iv} 1402.80 {\AA} line range from -34 to -120 km s$^{-1}$. The accelerated high-energy
electrons are composed of three groups. Those propagating upward along open field generate type
\textrm{III} radio bursts, while those propagating downward produce HXR emissions and drive chromospheric
condensation observed in the Si {\sc iv} line. The electrons trapped in the rising filament generate
a microwave burst lasting for $\le$40 s. Bidirectional outflows at the base of jet are manifested
by significant line broadenings of the Si {\sc iv} line. The blueshifted Doppler velocities of outflows
range from -13 to -101 km s$^{-1}$. The redshifted Doppler velocities of outflows range from $\sim$17
to $\sim$170 km s$^{-1}$. Our multiwavelength observations of the flare-related jet are in favor
of the breakout jet model and are important for understanding the acceleration and transport of
nonthermal electrons.

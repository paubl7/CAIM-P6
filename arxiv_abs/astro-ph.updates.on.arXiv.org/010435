We forecast and optimize the cosmological power of various weak-lensing aperture mass ($M_{\rm
ap}$) map statistics for future cosmic shear surveys, including peaks, voids, and the full distribution
of pixels (1D $M_{\rm ap}$). These alternative methods probe the non-Gaussian regime of the matter
distribution, adding complementary cosmological information to the classical two-point estimators.
Based on the SLICS and cosmo-SLICS $N$-body simulations, we build Euclid-like mocks to explore
the $S_8 - \Omega_{\rm m} - w_0$ parameter space. We develop a new tomographic formalism which exploits
the cross-information between redshift slices (cross-$M_{\rm ap}$) in addition to the information
from individual slices (auto-$M_{\rm ap}$) probed in the standard approach. Our auto-$M_{\rm
ap}$ forecast precision is in good agreement with the recent literature on weak-lensing peak statistics,
and is improved by $\sim 50$% when including cross-$M_{\rm ap}$. It is further boosted by the use
of 1D $M_{\rm ap}$ that outperforms all other estimators, including the shear two-point correlation
function ($\gamma$-2PCF). When considering all tomographic terms, our uncertainty range on the
structure growth parameter $S_8$ is enhanced by $\sim 45$% (almost twice better) when combining
1D $M_{\rm ap}$ and the $\gamma$-2PCF compared to the $\gamma$-2PCF alone. We additionally measure
the first combined forecasts on the dark energy equation of state $w_0$, finding a factor of three
reduction of the statistical error compared to the $\gamma$-2PCF alone. This demonstrates that
the complementary cosmological information explored by non-Gaussian $M_{\rm ap}$ map statistics
not only offers the potential to improve the constraints on the recent $\sigma_8$ - $\Omega_{\rm
m}$ tension, but also constitutes an avenue to understand the accelerated expansion of our Universe.

The exotic range of known planetary systems has provoked an equally exotic range of physical explanations
for their diverse architectures. However, constraining formation processes requires mapping
the observed exoplanet population to that which initially formed in the protoplanetary disc. Numerous
results suggest that (internal or external) dynamical perturbation alters the architectures
of some exoplanetary systems. Isolating planets that have evolved without any perturbation can
help constrain formation processes. We consider the Kepler multiples, which have low mutual inclinations
and are unlikely to have been dynamically perturbed. We apply a modelling approach similar to that
of Mulders et al. (2018), additionally accounting for the two-dimensionality of the radius ($R
=0.3-20\,R_\oplus$) and period ($P= 0.5-730$ days) distribution. We find that an upper limit in
planet mass of the form $M_{\rm{lim}} \propto a^\beta \exp(-a_{\rm{in}}/a)$, for semi-major
axis $a$ and a broad range of $a_{\rm{in}}$ and $\beta$, can reproduce a distribution of $P$, $R$
that is indistinguishable from the observed distribution by our comparison metric. The index is
consistent with $\beta= 1.5$, expected if growth is limited by accretion within the Hill radius.
This model is favoured over models assuming a separable PDF in $P$, $R$. The limit, extrapolated
to longer periods, is coincident with the orbits of RV-discovered planets ($a>0.2$ au, $M>1\,M_{\rm{J}}$)
around recently identified low density host stars, hinting at isolation mass limited growth. We
discuss the necessary circumstances for a coincidental age-related bias as the origin of this result,
concluding that such a bias is possible but unlikely. We conclude that, in light of the evidence that
some planetary systems have been dynamically perturbed, simple models for planet growth during
the formation stage are worth revisiting.

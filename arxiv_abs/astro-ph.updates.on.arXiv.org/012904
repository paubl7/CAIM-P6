Binary neutron star mergers are thought to be one of the dominant sites of production for rapid neutron
capture elements, including platinum and gold. Since the discovery of the binary neutron star merger
GW170817, and its associated kilonova AT2017gfo, numerous works have attempted to determine the
composition of its outflowing material, but they have been hampered by the lack of complete atomic
data. Here, we demonstrate how inclusion of new atomic data in synthetic spectra calculations can
provide insights and constraints on the production of the heaviest elements. We employ theoretical
atomic data (obtained using GRASP$^0$) for neutral, singly- and doubly-ionised platinum and gold,
to generate photospheric and simple nebular phase model spectra for kilonova-like ejecta properties.
We make predictions for the locations of strong transitions, which could feasibly appear in the
spectra of kilonovae that are rich in these species. We identify low-lying electric quadrupole
and magnetic dipole transitions that may give rise to forbidden lines when the ejecta becomes optically
thin. The strongest lines lie beyond $8000\,\r{A}$, motivating high quality near-infrared spectroscopic
follow-up of kilonova candidates. We compare our model spectra to the observed spectra of AT2017gfo,
and conclude that no platinum or gold signatures are prominent in the ejecta. From our nebular phase
modelling, we place tentative upper limits on the platinum and gold mass of $\lesssim$ a few $10^{-3}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$,
and $\lesssim 10^{-2}\,\rm{M}_{\odot}$, respectively. This work demonstrates how new atomic
data of heavy elements can be included in radiative transfer calculations, and motivates future
searches for elemental signatures.

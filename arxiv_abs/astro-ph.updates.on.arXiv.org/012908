The vector Apodizing Phase Plate (vAPP) is a class of pupil plane coronagraph that enables high-contrast
imaging by modifying the Point Spread Function (PSF) to create a dark hole of deep flux suppression
adjacent to the PSF core. Here, we recover the known brown dwarf HR 2562 B using a vAPP coronagraph,
in conjunction with the Magellan Adaptive Optics (MagAO) system, at a signal-to-noise of S/N = 3.04
in the lesser studied L-band regime. The data contained a mix of field and pupil-stabilised observations,
hence we explored three different processing techniques to extract the companion, including Flipped
Differential Imaging (FDI), a newly devised Principal Component Analysis (PCA)-based method
for vAPP data. Despite the partial field-stabilisation, the companion is recovered sufficiently
to measure a 3.94 $\mu$m narrow-band contrast of (3.05$\pm$1.00) $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ ($\Delta$m$_{3.94
{\mu}m}$ = 8.79$\pm$0.36 mag). Combined with archival GPI and SPHERE observations, our atmospheric
modelling indicates a spectral type at the L/T transition with mass M = 29$\pm$15 M$_{\text{Jup}}$,
consistent with literature results. However, effective temperature and surface gravity vary
significantly depending on the wavebands considered (1200$\leq$T$_{\text{eff}}$(K)$\leq$1700
and 4.0$\leq$log(g)(dex)$\leq$5.0), reflecting the challenges of modelling objects at the L/T
transition. Observations between 2.4-3.2 $\mu$m will be more effective in distinguishing cooler
brown dwarfs due to the onset of absorption bands in this region. We explain that instrumental scattered
light and wind-driven halo can be detrimental to FDI+PCA and thus must be sufficiently mitigated
to use this processing technique. We thus demonstrate the potential of vAPP coronagraphs in the
characterisation of high-contrast substellar companions, even in sub-optimal conditions, and
provide new, complementary photometry of HR 2562 B.

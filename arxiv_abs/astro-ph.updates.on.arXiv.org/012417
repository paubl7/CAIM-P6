We study the photodisintegration process triggered by the nonthermal electromagnetic Hawking
radiation from primordial black holes (PBHs) in critical collapse model. We consider the simplest
case that all PBHs formed at a single epoch stemming from an inflationary spectrum with a narrow peak,
and an extended mass distribution is obtained due to critical phenomena of gravitational collapse.
The presence of a low-mass tail of critical collapse mass function could lead to an enhancement of
energetic photon emissions from Hawking radiation of PBHs. Nuclear photodisintegration rates
are calculated with a nonthermal photon spectrum derived by solving the Boltzmann equation iteratively.
The exact spectrum is much different than that based on an often-used analytical bended power-law
spectrum and it is found to significantly depend on the adopted PBH mass functions. With the newest
observational limit on the $^3$He abundance in Galactic H II regions, the updated $^3$He constraints
on PBH mass spectrum in the horizon mass range $10^{12} - 10^{13}$ g are derived. Our results for the
first time show that $^3$He constraints on the critical mass function are about one order of magnitude
severer than the monochromatic one although the fraction of PBHs in the low-mass tail region is relatively
small. The $^6$Li elemental abundance is also enhanced significantly for the critical mass function.
More precise measurement of $^6$Li abundance is highly desirable to provide a promising constraint
on PBHs in the future. For monochromatic mass function, we provide the analytical bounds for photodisintegration
and hadrodissociation from PBH radiation, and we report discrepancies between our updated $^3$He
constraints and the previous results.

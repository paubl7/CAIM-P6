We present a global spectrophotometric characterization of the Ceres surface using Dawn Framing
Camera (FC) images. We identify the photometric model that yields the best results for photometrically
correcting images. Corrected FC images acquired on approach to Ceres were assembled into global
maps of albedo and color. Generally, albedo and color variations on Ceres are muted. The albedo map
is dominated by a large, circular feature in Vendimia Planitia, known from HST images (Li et al.,
2006), and dotted by smaller bright features mostly associated with fresh-looking craters. The
dominant color variation over the surface is represented by the presence of "blue" material in and
around such craters, which has a negative spectral slope over the visible wavelength range when
compared to average terrain. We also mapped variations of the phase curve by employing an exponential
photometric model, a technique previously applied to asteroid Vesta (Schr\"oder et al., 2013b).
The surface of Ceres scatters light differently from Vesta in the sense that the ejecta of several
fresh-looking craters may be physically smooth rather than rough. High albedo, blue color, and
physical smoothness all appear to be indicators of youth. The blue color may result from the desiccation
of ejected material that is similar to the phyllosilicates/water ice mixtures in the experiments
of Poch et al. (2016). The physical smoothness of some blue terrains would be consistent with an initially
liquid condition, perhaps as a consequence of impact melting of subsurface water ice. We find red
terrain (positive spectral slope) near Ernutet crater, where De Sanctis et al. (2017) detected
organic material. The spectrophotometric properties of the large Vendimia Planitia feature suggest
it is a palimpsest, consistent with the Marchi et al. (2016) impact basin hypothesis. The central
bright area in Occator crater, Cerealia...

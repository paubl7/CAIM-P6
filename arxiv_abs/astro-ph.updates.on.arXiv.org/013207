We want to explore the geometrical structure and mutual interactions of the innermost components
of the broad line radio galaxy (BLRG) 3C 215, with particular interest in the accretion and ejection
mechanisms involving the central supermassive black hole (SMBH). We compare these observational
features with the ones of the RQ Seyfert 1 galaxies. Investigating their differences it is possible
to understand more about the jet launching mechanisms, and why this phenomenon is efficient only
in a small fraction of all the AGNs. Using high quality data from a $\sim60$ ks observation with XMM-Newton,
we carried out a detailed X-ray spectral analysis of 3C 215 in the broad energy range $0.5-10$ keV.
We modeled the spectrum with an absorbed double power-law model for the primary continuum, reprocessed
by reflection from ionized and cold neutral material and modified by relativistic blurring. We
also compared our results with the ones obtained with previous multi-wavelength observations.
We obtain a primary continuum photon index from the corona $\Gamma_1=1.97\pm0.06$ and evidence
of a jet contribution, modeled as a power law with photon index $\Gamma_2\simeq1.29$. The reflector,
possibly the accretion disk and portions of the broad-line region (BLR), is ionized ($\log\xi=2.31_{-0.27}^{+0.37}\
\mathrm{erg\ s^{-1}\ cm}$) and relatively distant from the SMBH ($R_{in}>38\ R_g$), where $R_g=GM_{BH}/c^2$
is the gravitational radius. The obscuring torus seems patchy, dust-poor and inefficient, while
the jet emission shows a twisted and knotted geometry. We propose three scenarios in order to describe
these characteristics: 1.) ADAF state in the inner disk; 2.) Slim accretion disk; 3.) sub-pc SMBH
binary system (SMBHB).

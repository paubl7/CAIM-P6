The emergence of passive galaxies in the early Universe results from the interplay among the physical
processes responsible for their rapid assembly and for the abrupt shut-down of their SF. Investigating
the individual properties and demographics of early passive galaxies will improve our understanding
of these mechanisms. In this work we present a follow-up analysis of the z>3 passive galaxy candidates
selected by Merlin et al. (2019) in the CANDELS fields. We begin by first confirming the accuracy
of their passive classification by exploiting their sub-mm emission to demonstrate the lack of
ongoing SF. Using archival ALMA observations we are able to confirm at least 61% of the observed candidates
as passive. While the remainder lack sufficiently deep data for confirmation, we are able to validate
the entire sample in a statistical sense. We then estimate the Stellar Mass Function (SMF) of all
101 passive candidates in three redshift bins from z=5 to z=3. We adopt a stepwise approach that has
the advantage of taking into account photometric errors, mass completeness and the Eddington bias
without any a-posteriori correction. We observe a pronounced evolution in the SMF around z~4, indicating
that we are witnessing the emergence of the passive population at this epoch. Massive (M>10^11Msun)
passive galaxies, only accounting for a small (<20%) fraction of galaxies at z>4, become dominant
at later epochs. Thanks to a combination of photometric quality, sample selection and methodology,
we overall find a higher density of passive galaxies than previous works. The comparison with theoretical
predictions, despite a qualitative agreement, denotes a still incomplete understanding of the
physical processes responsible for the formation of these galaxies. Finally, we extrapolate our
results to predict the number of early passive galaxies expected in surveys carried out with future
facilities.

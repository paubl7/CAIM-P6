Joint analyses of small-scale cosmological structure probes are relatively unexplored and promise
to advance measurements of microphysical dark matter properties using heterogeneous data. Here,
we present a multidimensional analysis of dark matter substructure using strong gravitational
lenses and the Milky Way (MW) satellite galaxy population, accounting for degeneracies in model
predictions and using covariances in the constraining power of these individual probes for the
first time. We simultaneously infer the projected subhalo number density and the half-mode mass
describing the suppression of the subhalo mass function in thermal relic warm dark matter (WDM),
$M_{\mathrm{hm}}$, using the semianalytic model $\mathrm{\texttt{Galacticus}}$ to connect
the subhalo population inferred from MW satellite observations to the strong lensing host halo
mass and redshift regime. Combining MW satellite and strong lensing posteriors in this parameter
space yields $M_{\mathrm{hm}}<10^{7.0}\ M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$ (WDM particle mass $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}>9.7\
\mathrm{keV}$) at $95\%$ confidence and disfavors $M_{\mathrm{hm}}=10^{7.4}\ M_{\mathrm{\odot}}$
($m_{\mathrm{WDM}}=7.4\ \mathrm{keV}$) with a 20:1 marginal likelihood ratio, improving limits
on $m_{\mathrm{WDM}}$ set by the two methods independently by $\sim 30\%$. These results are marginalized
over the line-of-sight contribution to the strong lensing signal, the mass of the MW host halo, and
the efficiency of subhalo disruption due to baryons and are robust to differences in the disruption
efficiency between the MW and strong lensing regimes at the $\sim 10\%$ level. This work paves the
way for unified analyses of next-generation small-scale structure measurements covering a wide
range of scales and redshifts.

Sunspots are known to be strong absorbers of solar oscillation modal power. The most convincing
way to demonstrate this is done via Fourier-Hankel decomposition (FHD), where the local oscillation
field is separated into in- and outgoing waves, showing the reduction in power. Due to the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager's high-cadence Doppler measurements, power absorption can be investigated
at frequencies beyond the acoustic cutoff frequency. We perform an FHD on five sunspot regions and
two quiet-Sun control regions and study the resulting absorption spectra $\alpha_\ell(\nu)$,
specifically at frequencies $\nu$ > 5.3 mHz. We observe an unreported high-frequency absorption
feature, which only appears in the presence of a sunspot. This feature is confined to phase speeds
of one-skip waves whose origins coincide with the sunspot's center, with $v_{ph}$ = 85.7 km/s in
this case. By employing a fit to the absorption spectra at a constant phase speed, we find that the
peak absorption strength $\alpha_{max}$ lies between 0.166 and 0.222 at a noise level of about 0.009
(5%). The well-known absorption along ridges at lower frequencies can reach up to $\alpha_{max}\approx$
0.5. Thus our finding in the absorption spectrum is weaker, but nevertheless significant. From
first considerations regarding the energy budget of high-frequency waves, this observation can
likely be explained by the reduction of emissivity within the sunspot. We derive a simple relation
between emissivity and absorption. We conclude that sunspots yield a wave power absorption signature
(for certain phase speeds only), which may help in understanding the effect of strong magnetic fields
on convection and source excitation and potentially in understanding the general sunspot subsurface
structure.

We present the results of our monitoring campaigns of the Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) AT 2020hat in
NGC 5068 and AT 2020kog in NGC 6106. The two objects were imaged (and detected) before their discovery
by routine survey operations. They show a general trend of slow luminosity rise lasting at least
a few months. The subsequent major LRN outbursts were extensively followed in photometry and spectroscopy.
The light curves present an initial short-duration peak, followed by a redder plateau phase. AT
2020kog is a moderately luminous event peaking at ~7x10^40 erg/s, while AT 2020hat is almost one
order of magnitude fainter than AT 2020kog, although still more luminous than V838 Mon. In analogy
with other LRNe, the spectra of AT 2020kog change significantly with time. They resemble those of
Type IIn supernovae at early phases, then they become similar to those of K-type stars during the
plateau, and to M-type stars at very late phases. In contrast, AT 2020hat shows a redder continuum
already at early epochs, and its spectrum shows the late appearance of molecular bands. A moderate-resolution
spectrum of AT 2020hat taken at +37 d after maximum shows a forest of narrow P Cygni lines of metals
with velocities of 180 km/s, along with an Halpha emission with a full-width at half-maximum velocity
of 250 km/s. For AT 2020hat, a robust constraint on its quiescent progenitor is provided by archival
images of the Hubble Space Telescope. The progenitor is clearly detected as a mid-K type star, with
an absolute magnitude M_F606W=-3.33+-0.09 mag and a colour F606W-F814W=1.14+-0.05 mag, which
are inconsistent with the expectations from a massive star that could later produce a core-collapse
supernova. Although quite peculiar, the two objects well match the progenitor vs. light curve absolute
magnitude correlations discussed in the literature.

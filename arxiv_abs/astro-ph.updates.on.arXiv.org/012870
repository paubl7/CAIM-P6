In this era of spatially resolved observations of planet forming disks with ALMA and large ground-based
telescopes such as the VLT, Keck and Subaru, we still lack statistically relevant information on
the quantity and composition of the material that is building the planets, such as the total disk
gas mass, the ice content of dust, and the state of water in planetesimals. SPICA is an infrared space
mission concept developed jointly by JAXA and ESA to address these questions. The key unique capabilities
of SPICA that enable this research are (1) the wide spectral coverage 10-220 micron, (2) the high
line detection sensitivity of (1-2) 10-19 W m-2 with R~2000-5000 in the far-IR (SAFARI) and 10-20
W m-2 with R~29000 in the mid-IR (SMI, spectrally resolving line profiles), (3) the high far-IR continuum
sensitivity of 0.45 mJy (SAFARI), and (4) the observing efficiency for point source surveys. This
paper details how mid- to far-IR infrared spectra will be unique in measuring the gas masses and water/ice
content of disks and how these quantities evolve during the planet forming period. These observations
will clarify the crucial transition when disks exhaust their primordial gas and further planet
formation requires secondary gas produced from planetesimals. The high spectral resolution mid-IR
is also unique for determining the location of the snowline dividing the rocky and icy mass reservoirs
within the disk and how the divide evolves during the build-up of planetary systems. Infrared spectroscopy
(mid- to far-IR) of key solid state bands is crucial for assessing whether extensive radial mixing,
which is part of our Solar System history, is a general process occurring in most planetary systems
and whether extrasolar planetesimals are similar to our Solar System comets/asteroids. ... (abbreviated)

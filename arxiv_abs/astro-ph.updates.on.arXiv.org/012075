Dark energy is the constituent with an enormous abundance of the present universe, responsible
for the universe's accelerated expansion. Therefore, it is plausible that dark energy may interact
within any compact astrophysical objects. The author in Ref. [Phys. Rev. D 83, 127501 (2011)], constructs
an exact star solution consisting of an ordinary matter and phantom field from a constant density
star (CDS) known as Schwarzschild interior solution. The star denotes a dark energy star (DES).
The author claims that the phantom field represents dark energy within the star. So far, the role
of the phantom field as dark energy in DES is not systematically studied yet. Related to this issue,
we analyze the energy condition of DES. We expect that DES shall violate the strong energy condition
(SEC) for a particular condition. We discover that SEC is fully violated only when the compactness
reaches the Buchdahl limit. Furthermore, we also investigate the causal conditions and stabilities
due to the convective motion and gravitational cracking. We also find that those conditions are
violated. These results indicate that DES is not physically stable. However, we may consider DES
as an ultra-compact object of which we can calculate the gravitational wave echo time and echo frequency
and compare them to those of CDS. We find that the contribution of the phantom field delays the gravitational
wave echoes. The effective potential of the perturbed DES is also studied. The potential also enjoys
a potential well like CDS but with a deeper well. We also investigate the possibility that DES could
form a gravastar when $ C=1 $. It is found that gravastar produced from DES possesses no singularity
with a dS-like phase as the interior. These results could open more opportunities for the observational
study of dark energy in the near future, mostly from the compact astrophysical objects.

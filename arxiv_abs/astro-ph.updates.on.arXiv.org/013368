We report the highest spatial resolution measurement of magnetic fields in M17 using thermal dust
polarization taken by SOFIA/HAWC+ centered at 154 $\mu$m wavelength. Using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi
method, we found the presence of strong magnetic fields of $980 \pm 230\;\mu$G and $1665 \pm 885\;\mu$G
in lower-density (M17-N) and higher-density (M17-S) regions, respectively. The magnetic field
morphology in M17-N possibly mimics the fields in gravitational collapse molecular cores while
in M17-S the fields run perpendicular to the matter structure and display a pillar and an asymmetric
hourglass shape. The mean values of the magnetic field strength are used to determine the Alfv\'enic
Mach numbers ($\mathcal{M_A}$) of M17-N and M17-S which turn out to be sub-Alfv\'enic, or magnetic
fields dominate turbulence. We calculate the mass-to-flux ratio, $\lambda$, and obtain $\lambda=0.07$
for M17-N and $0.28$ for M17-S. The sub-critical values of $\lambda$ are in agreement with the lack
of massive stars formed in M17. To study dust physics, we analyze the relationship between the dust
polarization fraction, $p$, and the thermal emission intensity, $I$, gas column density, $N({\rm
H_2})$, and dust temperature, $T_{\rm d}$. The polarization fraction decreases with intensity
as $I^{-\alpha}$ with $\alpha = 0.51$. The polarization fraction also decreases with increasing
$N(\rm H_{2})$, which can be explained by the decrease of grain alignment by radiative torques (RATs)
toward denser regions with a weaker radiation field and/or tangling of magnetic fields. The polarization
fraction tends to increase with $T_{\rm d}$ first and then decreases when $T_ {\rm d} > 50$ K. The latter
feature seen in the M17-N, where the gas density changes slowly with $T_{d}$, is consistent with
the RAT disruption effect.

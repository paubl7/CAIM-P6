Molecular clouds, which harbor the birthplaces of stars, form out of the atomic phase of the interstellar
medium (ISM). We aim to characterize the atomic and molecular phases of the ISM and set their physical
properties into the context of cloud formation processes. We studied the cold neutral medium (CNM)
by means of $\rm HI$ self-absorption (HISA) toward the giant molecular filament GMF20.0-17.9 and
compared our results with molecular gas traced by $^{13}\rm CO$ emission. We fitted baselines of
HISA features to $\rm HI$ emission spectra using first and second order polynomial functions. The
CNM identified by this method spatially correlates with the morphology of the molecular gas toward
the western region. However, no spatial correlation between HISA and $^{13}\rm CO$ is evident toward
the eastern part of the filament. The distribution of HISA peak velocities and line widths agrees
well with $^{13}\rm CO$ within the whole filament. The column density probability density functions
(N-PDFs) of HISA (CNM) and $\rm HI$ emission (tracing both the CNM and the warm neutral medium, WNM)
have a log-normal shape for all parts of the filament, indicative of turbulent motions as the main
driver for these structures. The $\rm H_2$ N-PDFs show a broad log-normal distribution with a power-law
tail suggesting the onset of gravitational contraction. The saturation of $\rm HI$ column density
is observed at $\sim$25$\rm\,M_{\odot}\,pc^{-2}$. We conjecture that different evolutionary
stages are evident within the filament. In the eastern region, we witness the onset of molecular
cloud formation out of the atomic gas reservoir while the western part is more evolved, as it reveals
pronounced $\rm H_2$ column density peaks and signs of active star formation.

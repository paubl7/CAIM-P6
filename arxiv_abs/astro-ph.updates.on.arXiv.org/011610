At subterahertz frequencies -- \textit{i.e.}, millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths -- there
is a gap of measurements of the solar radius as well as other parameters of the solar atmosphere. As
the observational wavelength changes, the radius varies because the altitude of the dominant electromagnetic
radiation is produced at different heights in the solar atmosphere. Moreover, radius variations
throughout long time series are indicative of changes in the solar atmosphere that may be related
to the solar cycle. Therefore, the solar radius is an important parameter for the calibration of
solar atmospheric models enabling a better understanding of the atmospheric structure. In this
work we use data from the Solar Submillimeter-wave Telescope (SST) and from the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA), at the frequencies of 100, 212, 230, and 405 GHz, to measure the equatorial and polar
radii of the Sun. The radii measured with extensive data from the SST agree with the radius-vs-frequency
trend present in the literature. The radii derived from ALMA maps at 230 GHz also agree with the radius-vs-frequency
trend, whereas the 100-GHz radii are slightly above the values reported by other authors. In addition,
we analyze the equatorial and polar radius behavior over the years, by determining the correlation
coefficient between solar activity and subterahertz radii time series at 212 and 405 GHz (SST).
The variation of the SST-derived radii over 13 years are correlated to the solar activity when considering
equatorial regions of the solar atmosphere, and anticorrelated when considering polar regions.
The ALMA derived radii time series for 100 and 230 GHz show very similar behaviors with those of SST.

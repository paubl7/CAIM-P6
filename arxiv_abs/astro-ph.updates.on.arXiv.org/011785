Context: Type Ibn supernovae are a rare class of stripped envelope supernovae interacting with
a helium-rich CSM. The majority of the SNe Ibn reported display a surprising homogeneity in their
fast lightcurves and starforming hosts. Aims: We present the discovery and study of SN 2020bqj (ZTF20aalrqbu),
a SN Ibn with a long-duration peak plateau lasting 40 days and hosted by a faint low-mass galaxy. We
aim to explain its peculiar properties using an extensive data set. Methods: We compare the evolution
of SN 2020bqj with SNe Ibn from the literature. We fit the bolometric and multi-band lightcurves
with different powering mechanism models. Results: The risetime, peak magnitude and spectral
features of SN 2020bqj are consistent with those of most SNe Ibn, but the SN is a clear outlier based
on its bright, long-lasting peak plateau and low host mass. We show through modeling that the lightcurve
can be powered predominantly by shock heating from the interaction of the SN ejecta and a dense CSM.
The peculiar Type Ibn SN 2011hw is a close analog to SN 2020bqj, suggesting a similar progenitor and
CSM scenario. In this scenario a very massive progenitor star in the transitional phase between
a luminous blue variable and a compact Wolf-Rayet star undergoes core-collapse, embedded in a dense
helium-rich CSM with an elevated opacity compared to normal SNe Ibn, due to the presence of residual
hydrogen. This scenario is consistent with the observed properties of SN 2020bqj and the modeling
results. Conclusions: SN 2020bqj is a compelling example of a transitional SN Ibn/IIn based on not
only its spectral features, but also its lightcurve, host galaxy properties and the inferred progenitor
properties. The strong similarity with SN 2011hw suggests this subclass may be the result of a progenitor
in a stellar evolution phase that is distinct from those of progenitors of regular SNe Ibn.

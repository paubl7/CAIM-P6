We present the source associations, cross-identifications, and multi-wavelength properties
of the faint radio source population detected in the deep tier of the LOFAR Two Metre Sky Survey (LoTSS):
the LoTSS Deep Fields. The first LoTSS Deep Fields data release consists of deep radio imaging at
150~MHz of the ELAIS-N1, Lockman Hole, and Bo\"{o}tes fields, down to RMS sensitives of around 20,
22, and 32$~\mu$Jy\,beam$^{-1}$, respectively. These fields are some of the best studied extra-galactic
fields in the northern sky, with existing deep, wide-area panchromatic photometry from X-ray to
infrared wavelengths, covering a total of $\approx$~26~\mbox{deg$^{2}$}. We first generated
improved multi-wavelength catalogues in ELAIS-N1 and Lockman Hole; combined with the existing
catalogue for Bo\"{o}tes, we present forced, matched aperture photometry for over 7.2 million
sources across the three fields. We identified multi-wavelength counterparts to the radio detected
sources, using a combination of the Likelihood Ratio method and visual classification, which greatly
enhances the scientific potential of radio surveys and allows for the characterisation of the photometric
redshifts and the physical properties of the host galaxies. The final radio-optical cross-matched
catalogue consists of 81\,951 radio-detected sources, with counterparts identified and multi-wavelength
properties presented for 79\,820 ($>$97\%) sources. We also examine the properties of the host
galaxies, and through stacking analysis find that the radio population with no identified counterpart
is likely dominated by AGN at $z\sim3-4$. This dataset contains one of the largest samples of radio-selected
star-forming galaxies and active galactic nuclei (AGN) at these depths, making it ideal for studying
the history of star-formation, and the evolution of galaxies and AGN across cosmic time.

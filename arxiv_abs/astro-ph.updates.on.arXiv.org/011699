White dwarfs with metal-polluted atmospheres have been studied widely in the context of the accretion
of rocky debris from evolved planetary systems. One open question is the geometry of accretion and
how material arrives and mixes in the white dwarf surface layers. Using the 3D radiation-hydrodynamics
code CO$^5$BOLD, we present the first transport coefficients in degenerate star atmospheres which
describe the advection-diffusion of a passive scalar across the surface-plane. We couple newly
derived horizontal diffusion coefficients with previously published vertical diffusion coefficients
to provide theoretical constraints on surface spreading of metals in white dwarfs. Our grid of 3D
simulations probes the vast majority of the parameter space of convective white dwarfs, with pure-hydrogen
atmospheres in the effective temperature range 6000-18000 K and pure-helium atmospheres in the
range 12000-34000 K. Our results suggest that warm hydrogen-rich atmospheres (DA; $\gtrsim$13000
K) and helium-rich atmospheres (DB, DBA; $\gtrsim$30000 K) are unable to efficiently spread the
accreted metals across their surface, regardless of the time dependence of accretion. This result
may be at odds with the current non-detection of surface abundance variations at white dwarfs with
debris discs. For cooler hydrogen- and helium-rich atmospheres, we predict a largely homogeneous
distribution of metals across the surface within a vertical diffusion timescale. This is typically
less than 0.1 per cent of disc lifetime estimates, a quantity which is revisited in this paper using
the overshoot results. These results have relevance for studies of the bulk composition of evolved
planetary systems and models of accretion disc physics.

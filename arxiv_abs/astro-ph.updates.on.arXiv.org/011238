We show experimentally that a continuous, linear, dielectric antenna in which a superluminal polarization-current
distribution accelerates can be used to transmit a broadband signal that is reproduced in a comprehensible
form at a chosen target distance and angle. The requirement for this exact correspondence between
broadcast and received signals is that each moving point in the polarization-current distribution
approaches the target at the speed of light at all times during its transit along the antenna. This
results in a one-to-one correspondence between the time at which each point on the moving polarization
current enters the antenna and the time at which {\it all} of the radiation emitted by this particular
point during its transit through the antenna arrives simultaneously at the target. This has the
effect of reproducing the desired time dependence of the original broadcast signal. For other observer/detector
positions, the time dependence of the signal is scrambled, due to the non-trivial relationship
between emission (retarded) time and reception time. This technique represents a contrast to conventional
radio transmission methods; in most examples of the latter, signals are broadcast with little or
no directivity, selectivity of reception being achieved through the use of narrow frequency bands.
In place of this, the current paper uses a spread of frequencies to transmit information to a particular
location; the signal is weaker and has a scrambled time dependence elsewhere. We point out the possible
relevance of this mechanism to 5G neighbourhood networks. This work also constitutes a ground-based
astrophysics experiment that gives strong clues towards the emission mechanism of pulsars.

We present broad-band X-ray spectroscopy of the energetic components that make up the supernova
remnant (SNR) Kesteven 75 using concurrent 2017 Aug 17-20 XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations,
during which the pulsar PSR J1846-0258 is found to be in the quiescent state. The young remnant hosts
a bright pulsar wind nebula powered by the highly-energetic (Edot = 8.1E36 erg/s) isolated, rotation-powered
pulsar, with a spin-down age of only P/2Pdot ~ 728 yr. Its inferred magnetic field (Bs = 4.9E13 G) is
the largest known for these objects, and is likely responsible for intervals of flare and burst activity,
suggesting a transition between/to a magnetar state. The pulsed emission from PSR J1846-0258 is
well-characterized in the 2-50 keV range by a power-law model with photon index Gamma_PSR = 1.24+/-0.09
and a 2-10 keV unabsorbed flux of (2.3+/-0.4)E-12 erg/s/cm^2). We find no evidence for an additional
non-thermal component above 10 keV in the current state, as would be typical for a magnetar. Compared
to the Chandra pulsar spectrum, the intrinsic pulsed fraction is 71+/-16% in 2-10 keV band. A power-law
spectrum for the PWN yields Gamma_PWN = 2.03+/-0.03 in the 1-55 keV band, with no evidence of curvature
in this range, and a 2-10 keV unabsorbed flux (2.13+/-0.02)E-11 erg/s/cm^2. The NuSTAR data reveal
evidence for a hard X-ray component dominating the SNR spectrum above 10 keV which we attribute to
a dust-scattered PWN component. We model the dynamical and radiative evolution of the Kes 75 system
to estimate the birth properties of the neutron star, the energetics of its progenitor, and properties
of the PWN. This suggests that the progenitor of Kes 75 was originally in a binary system which transferred
most its mass to a companion before exploding.

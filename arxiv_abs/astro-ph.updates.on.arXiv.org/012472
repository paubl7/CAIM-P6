Context. The physical processes driving the formation of Galactic spiral arms are still under debate.
Studies using open clusters favour the description of the Milky Way spiral arms as long-lived structures
following the classical density wave theory. Current studies comparing the Gaia DR2 field stars
kinematic information of the Solar neighbourhood to simulations, find a better agreement with
short-lived arms with a transient behaviour. Aims. Our aim is to provide an observational, data-driven
view of the Milky Way spiral structure and its dynamics using open clusters as the main tracers, and
to contrast it with simulation-based approaches. We use the most complete catalogue of Milky Way
open clusters, with astrometric Gaia EDR3 updated parameters, estimated astrophysical information
and radial velocities, to re-visit the nature of the spiral pattern of the Galaxy. Methods. We use
a Gaussian mixture model to detect overdensities of open clusters younger than 30 Myr that correspond
to the Perseus, Local, Sagittarius and Scutum spiral arms, respectively. We use the birthplaces
of the open cluster population younger than 80 Myr to trace the evolution of the different spiral
arms and compute their pattern speed. We analyse the age distribution of the open clusters across
the spiral arms to explore the differences in the rotational velocity of stars and spiral arms. Results.
We are able to increase the range in Galactic azimuth where present-day spiral arms are described,
better estimating its parameters by adding 264 young open clusters to the 84 high-mass star-forming
regions used so far, thus increasing by a 314% the number of tracers. We use the evolution of the open
clusters from their birth positions to find that spiral arms nearly co-rotate with field stars at
any given radius, discarding a common spiral pattern speed for the spiral arms explored. [abridged]

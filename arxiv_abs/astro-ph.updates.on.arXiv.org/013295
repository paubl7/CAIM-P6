Asteroid families with ages younger than $1$ Myr offer an interesting possibility of studying the
outcomes of asteroid disruptions that are little modified by subsequent evolutionary processes.
We analyze a very young asteroid family associated with (18777) Hobson in the central part of the
main belt. We aim at (i) understanding its peculiar size distribution, and (ii) setting an upper
limit on the characteristic dispersal velocity at subkilometer sizes corresponding to the smallest
visible Hobson members. We identified the Hobson family using an up-to-date asteroid catalog.
A significant increase in the number of its known members allowed us to study their size distribution
and compare it with computer simulations of catastrophic disruptions. Backward orbital integrations
of the heliocentric orbits allowed us to confirm the previously suggested age of Hobson and helped
to estimate limits of the ejection speed. The Hobson family has an unusual size distribution: two
nearly equal-size bodies, followed by a population of smaller asteroids, whose distribution takes
a characteristic power law. There are two possibilities to explain these data. Either a canonical
impact onto a single parent body, requiring fine-tuned impact conditions that have not been studied
so far, or an unconventional model for the parent object of the Hobson family, namely a binary with
$\simeq 7-9$ km primary and a $\simeq 2.5$ km secondary. In the latter case, the primary was disrupted,
leaving behind the largest remnant (18777) Hobson and a suite of subkilometer asteroids. The second
largest asteroid, (57738) 2001 UZ160, is the nearly intact satellite of the parent binary. The excellent
convergence of nominal orbits of Hobson members sets an upper limit of $\simeq (10-20)$ m s$^{-1}$
for the initial dispersal velocity of the known members, which is consistent with both formation
models.

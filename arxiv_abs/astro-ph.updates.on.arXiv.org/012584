We have undertaken a systematic study of FRI and FRII radio galaxies with the upgraded Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (uGMRT) and MeerKAT. The main goal is to explore whether the unprecedented few $\mu$Jy
sensitivity reached in the range 550-1712 MHz at the resolution of $\sim4^{\prime\prime}-7^{\prime\prime}$
reveals new features in the radio emission which might need us to revise our current classification
scheme for classical radio galaxies. In this paper we present the results for the first set of four
radio galaxies, i.e. 4C 12.02, 4C 12.03, CGCG 044-046 and CGCG 021-063. The sources have been selected
from the 4C sample with well-defined criteria, and have been imaged with the uGMRT in the range 550-850
MHz (band 4) and with the MeerKAT in the range 856-1712 MHz (L-band). Full resolution images are presented
for all sources in the sample, together with MeerKAT in-band spectral images. Additionally, the
uGMRT-MeerKAT spectral image and MeerKAT L-band polarisation structure are provided for CGCG
044-046. Our images contain a wealth of morphological details, such as filamentary structure in
the emission from the lobes, radio emission beyond the hot-spots in three sources, and misalignments.
We briefly discuss the overall properties of CGCG 044-046 in the light of the local environment as
well, and show possible restarted activity in 4C 12.03 which needs to be confirmed. We conclude that
at least for the sources presented here, the classical FRI/FRII morphological classification
still holds with the current improved imaging capabilities, but the richness in details also suggests
caution in the systematic morphological classification carried out with automatic procedures
in surveys with poorer sensitivity and angular resolution.

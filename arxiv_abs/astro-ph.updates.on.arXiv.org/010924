In the present paper, we derive a new dispersion relation for slow magnetoacoustic waves invoking
the effect of thermal conductivity, compressive viscosity, radiation and unknown heating term
along with the consideration of heating cooling imbalance from linearized MHD equations. We solve
the general dispersion relation to understand role of compressive viscosity and thermal conductivity
in damping of the slow waves in coronal loops with and without heating cooling imbalance. We have
analyzed wave damping for the range of loop length $L$=50-500 Mm, temperature $T$=5-30 MK, and density
$\rho$=10$^{-11}$-10$^{-9}$ kg m$^{-3}$. It was found that inclusion of compressive viscosity
along with thermal conductivity significantly enhances the damping of fundamental mode oscillations
in shorter (e.g., $L$=50 Mm) and super-hot ($T>$10 MK) loops. However, role of the viscosity in damping
is insignificant in longer (e.g., $L$=500 Mm) and hot loops (T$\leq$10 MK) where, instead, thermal
conductivity along with the presence of heating cooling imbalance plays a dominant role. For the
shorter loops at the super-hot regime of the temperature, increment in loop density substantially
enhances damping of the fundamental modes due to thermal conductivity when the viscosity is absent,
however, when the compressive viscosity is added the increase in density substantially weakens
damping. Thermal conductivity alone is found to play a dominant role in longer loops at lower temperatures
(T$\leq$10 MK), while compressive viscosity dominates in damping at super-hot temperatures ($T>$10
MK) in shorter loops. The predicted scaling law between damping time ($\tau$) and wave period ($P$)
is found to better match to observed SUMER oscillations when heating cooling imbalance is taken
into account in addition to thermal conductivity and compressive viscosity for the damping of the
fundamental slow mode oscillations.

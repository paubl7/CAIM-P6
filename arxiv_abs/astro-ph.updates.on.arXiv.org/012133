Over the last two decades, a large population of close-in planets has been detected around a wide
variety of host stars. Such exoplanets are likely to undergo planetary migration through magnetic
and tidal interactions. We aim to follow the orbital evolution of a planet along the structural and
rotational evolution of its host star by taking into account simultaneously tidal and magnetic
torques, in order to explain some properties of the distribution of observed close-in planets.
We rely on a numerical model of a coplanar circular star-planet system taking into account stellar
structural changes, wind braking and star-planet interactions, called ESPEM. We browse the parameter
space of star-planet systems' configurations and assess the relative influence of magnetic and
tidal torques on secular evolution. We then synthesize star-planet populations and confront their
distribution in orbital and stellar rotation periods to Kepler satellite data. First, we find that
after the dissipation of the protoplanetary disk, both types of interactions can dominate secular
evolution depending on the initial configuration of the system and the evolutionary phase considered.
Moreover, different populations of star-planet systems emerge from the combined action of both
kinds of interactions, according to the evolutionary phase during which the planet migrates significantly.
This may affect significantly the detectability of star-planet systems as well as the validity
of gyrochonology. All in all, star-planet interactions significantly impact the global distribution
in orbital periods during the main sequence, while the global distribution in stellar rotation
periods is marginally affected. More precisely, star-planet magnetic interactions significantly
affect the distribution of super-Earths around slowly rotating stars, while tidal effects are
found to shape the distribution of giant planets.

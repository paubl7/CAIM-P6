One of the most important discoveries to emerge from the ESA Gaia astrometric survey is the "phase
spiral" pattern detected in the $z-V_z$ plane throughout the solar neighbourhood. In Galactic
cylindrical coordinates ($R,\phi,z$),individual stars have velocities ($V_R,V_\phi,V_z$)
and oscillation frequencies ($\Omega_R,\Omega_\phi,\Omega_z$)=($\kappa,\Omega,\nu$).
The phase spiral is most evident when each point of the $z-V_z$ phase plane is represented by either
$\langle V_R\rangle$ or $\langle V_\phi\rangle$, averaged over the volume, indicating that the
disturbance has locked the vertical oscillations with the in-plane epicyclic motions. We revisit
Binney & Schoenrich (2018) who use an analytic model of a disc-crossing satellite ($2\times 10^{10}$
M$_\odot$) to explain the phase spiral and its coupled behaviour in $\langle V_R\rangle$ and $\langle
V_\phi\rangle$. With the aid of the AGAMA and RAMSES codes, we explore a high-resolution N-body
model that is true to the analytic calculation. We find that the impulse triggers a superposition
of two distinct bisymmetric (m=2) modes -- a density wave and a bending wave -- that wrap up at different
rates. Stars in the faster density wave wrap up with time $T$ according to $\phi_D(R,T)=(\Omega_D(R)+\Omega_o)T$
where $\phi_D$ describes the spiral pattern and $\Omega_D=\Omega(R)-\kappa(R)/2$. While the
pattern speed $\Omega_o$ is small, it is non-zero indicating that this is a dynamic density wave.
The slower bending wave wraps up according to $\Omega_B\approx\Omega_D/2$ producing a corrugated
wave, a phenomenon now well established in the Galaxy. The bunching effect of the density wave triggers
the "phase spiral" as it rolls up and down on the bending wave ("rollercoaster" model). The phase
spiral emerges slowly about 380 Myr after impact, and symbiotically in $\langle V_R\rangle$ and
$\langle V_\phi\rangle$...

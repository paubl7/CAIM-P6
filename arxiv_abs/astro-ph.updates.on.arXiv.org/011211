One of the key challenges of real-time detection and parameter estimation of gravitational waves
from compact binary mergers is the computational cost of conventional matched-filtering and Bayesian
inference approaches. In particular, the application of these methods to the full signal parameter
space available to the gravitational-wave detectors, and/or real-time parameter estimation
is computationally prohibitive. On the other hand, rapid detection and inference are critical
for prompt follow-up of the electromagnetic and astro-particle counterparts accompanying important
transients, such as binary neutron-star and black-hole neutron-star mergers. Training deep neural
networks to identify specific signals and learn a computationally efficient representation of
the mapping between gravitational-wave signals and their parameters allows both detection and
inference to be done quickly and reliably, with high sensitivity and accuracy. In this work we apply
a deep-learning approach to rapidly identify and characterize transient gravitational-wave
signals from binary neutron-star mergers in real LIGO data. We show for the first time that artificial
neural networks can promptly detect and characterize binary neutron star gravitational-wave
signals in real LIGO data, and distinguish them from noise and signals from coalescing black-hole
binaries. We demonstrate that our deep-learning framework recovers successfully all gravitational-wave
events from the Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, GWTC-1 [Phys. Rev. X 9 (2019), 031040].
These results emphasize the importance of using realistic gravitational-wave detector data in
machine learning approaches, and represent a step towards achieving real-time detection and inference
of gravitational waves.

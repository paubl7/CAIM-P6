Determining photometric redshifts to high accuracy is paramount to measure distances in wide-field
cosmological experiments. With only photometric information at hand, photo-zs are prone to systematic
uncertainties in the intervening extinction and the unknown underlying spectral-energy distribution
of different astrophysical sources. Here, we aim to resolve these model degeneracies and obtain
a clear separation between intrinsic physical properties of astrophysical sources and extrinsic
systematics. We aim at estimates of the full photo-z probability distributions, and their uncertainties.
We perform a probabilistic photo-z determination using Mixture Density Networks (MDN). The training
data-set is composed of optical ($griz$) point-spread-function and model magnitudes and extinction
measurements from the SDSS-DR15, and WISE midinfrared ($3.4 \mu$m and $4.6 \mu$m) model magnitudes.
We use Infinite Gaussian Mixture models to classify the objects in our data-set as stars, galaxies
or quasars, and to determine the number of MDN components to achieve optimal performance. The fraction
of objects that are correctly split into the main classes is 94%. Our method improves the bias of photometric
redshift estimation (i.e. the mean $\Delta z$ = (zp - zs)/(1 + zs)) by one order of magnitude compared
to the SDSS photo-z, and decreases the fraction of $3 \sigma$ outliers (i.e. 3rms$(\Delta z) < \Delta
z$). The relative, root-mean-square systematic uncertainty in our resulting photo-zs is down
to 1.7% for low-redshift galaxies (zs $<$ 0.5). We have demonstrated the feasibility of machine-learning
based methods that produce full probability distributions for photo-z estimates with a performance
that is competitive with state-of-the art techniques. Our method can be applied to wide-field surveys
where extinction can vary significantly across the sky and with sparse spectroscopic calibration
samples.

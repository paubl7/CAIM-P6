T Tauri has long been the prototypical young pre-main-sequence star. However, it has now been decomposed
into a triple system with a complex disk and outflow geometry. We aim to measure the brightness of
all three components of the T Tauri system (T Tau N, T Tau Sa, T Tau Sb) in the mid-infrared in order to
obtain photometry around the $\sim 9.7~\mu m$ silicate feature. This allows us to study their variability
and to investigate the distribution of dust and the geometry of circumstellar and circumbinary
disks in this complex system. We observe T Tauri with the VLT/VISIR-NEAR instrument. With kernel
phase interferometry post-processing of the data, and using the astrometric positions of all three
components from VLT/SPHERE, we measure the three components' individual brightnesses (including
the southern binary at an angular separation down to $\sim 0.2~\lambda/D$) and obtain their photometry.
In order to validate our methods, we simulate and recover mock data of the T Tauri system using the
observed reference point-spread function of HD 27639. We find that T Tau N is rather stable and shows
weak silicate emission, while T Tau Sa is highly variable and shows prominent silicate absorption.
T Tau Sb became significantly fainter compared to data from 2004 and 2006, suggesting increased
extinction by dust. The precision of our photometry is limited by systematic errors, which is consistent
with previous studies using kernel phase interferometry. Our results confirm the complex scenario
of misaligned disks in the T Tauri system that had been observed previously, and they are in agreement
with the recently observed dimming of T Tau Sb in the near-infrared. Our mid-infrared photometry
supports the interpretation that T Tau Sb has moved behind the dense region of the Sa-Sb circumbinary
disk on its tight orbit around Sa, therefore suffering increased extinction.

We study the angular correlation function of star-forming galaxies and properties of their host
dark matter halos at $z>1$ using the Subaru Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) survey. We use [OII] emitters
identified using two narrow-band (NB) filters, NB816 and NB921, in the Deep/UltraDeep layers,
which respectively cover large angular areas of $16.3 ~{\rm deg}^2$ and $16.9~{\rm deg}^2$. Our
sample contains 8302 and 9578 [OII] emitters at $z=1.19$ (NB816) and $z=1.47$ (NB921), respectively.
We detect a strong clustering signal over a wide angular range, $0.001 < \theta < 1$ [deg], with the
bias $b=1.61^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ ($z=1.19$) and $b=2.09^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ ($z=1.47$). We also
find the clear deviation of the correlation from a simple power-law form. To interpret the measured
clustering signal, we adopt a halo occupation distribution (HOD) model which is constructed to
explain the spatial distribution of galaxies selected by a star formation rate. The observed correlation
function and number density are simultaneously explained by the best-fitting HOD model. From the
constrained HOD model, the average mass of halos hosting the [OII] emitters is derived to be $\log{M_{\rm
eff}/(h^{-1}M_\odot)}=12.70^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$ and $12.61^{+0.09}_{-0.05}$ at $z=1.19$ and
$1.47$, respectively, which will become halos with the present-day mass, $M\sim 1.5 \times 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$.
The satellite fraction of the [OII] emitter sample is found to be $f_{\rm sat}\sim 0.15$. All these
values are consistent with the previous studies of similar samples, but we obtain tighter constraints
due to the high number density and large angular coverage of our sample. The results obtained for
host halos of [OII] emitters in this paper are expected to be applicable to upcoming emission line
galaxy surveys such as the Subaru Prime Focus Spectrograph survey.

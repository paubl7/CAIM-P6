The Large Survey Project (LSP) "MeerKAT Absorption Line Survey" (MALS) is a blind HI 21-cm and OH
18-cm absorption line survey in the L- and UHF-bands, with the primary goal to better determine the
occurrence of atomic and molecular gas in the circum-galactic and inter-galactic medium, and its
redshift evolution. Here we present the first results using the UHF-band, obtained towards the
strongly lensed radio source PKS1830, detecting absorption in the lens galaxy. With merely 90min
of data acquired on-source for science verification and processed using the Automated Radio Telescope
Imaging Pipeline (ARTIP), we detect in absorption the known HI 21-cm and OH 18-cm main lines at z=0.89
at an unprecedented signal-to-noise ratio (4000 in the continuum, with 6km/s channels). For the
first time we report the detection at z=0.89 of OH satellite lines, so far not detected at z $>$ 0.25.
We decompose the OH lines into a thermal and a stimulated contribution, where the 1612 and 1720MHz
lines are conjugate. The total OH 1720MHz emission line luminosity is 6100Lsun. This is the most
luminous known 1720MHz maser line. The absorption components of the different images of the background
source sample different light paths in the lensing galaxy, and their weights in the total absorption
spectrum are expected to vary in time, on daily and monthly time scales. We compare our normalized
spectra with those obtained more than 20 yrs ago, and find no variation. We interpret the absorption
spectra with the help of a lens galaxy model, derived from an N-body hydro-dynamical simulation,
with a morphology similar to its optical HST image. It is possible to reproduce the observations
without invoking any central gas outflows. There are, however, distinct and faint high-velocity
features, most likely high-velocity clouds. These clouds may contribute to broaden the HI and OH
spectra.

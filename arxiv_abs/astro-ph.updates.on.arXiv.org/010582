String inspired models can serve as potential candidates to replace GR in the high energy regime
where quantum gravity is expected to play a vital role. Such models not only subsume the ultraviolet
nature of gravity but also exhibit promising prospects in resolving issues like dark matter and
dark energy, which cannot be adequately addressed within the framework of GR. The Einstein-Maxwell
dilaton-axion (EMDA) theory, which is central to this work is one such string inspired model arising
in the low energy effective action of the heterotic string theory with interesting implications
in inflationary cosmology and in the late time acceleration of the universe. It is therefore important
to survey the role of such a theory in explaining astrophysical observations, e.g. the continuum
spectrum of black holes which is expected to hold a wealth of information regarding the background
metric. The Kerr-Sen spacetime corresponds to the exact, stationary, and axisymmetric black hole
solution in EMDA gravity, possessing dilatonic charge and angular momentum originating from the
axionic field. In this work, we compute the theoretical spectrum from the accretion disk around
quasars in the Kerr-Sen background assuming the thin accretion disk model due to Novikov \& Thorne.
This is then used to evaluate the theoretical estimates of optical luminosity for a sample of eighty
Palomar-Green quasars which are subsequently compared with the available observations. Our results
based on $\chi^2$ analysis indicate that the dilaton parameter $r_2\sim 0.2$ is favored by optical
observations of quasars which is further corroborated by other error estimators e.g., the Nash-Sutcliffe
efficiency, the index of agreement, and their modified versions. We further report that strong
dilaton charges ($r_2>1.6$) are disfavored by quasar optical data and the spins associated with
the quasars are also estimated.

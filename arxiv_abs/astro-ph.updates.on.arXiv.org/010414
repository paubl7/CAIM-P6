We calculate the effect of dark matter (DM) being encapsulated in primordial black holes (PBHs)
on the power spectrum of density fluctuations P(k); we also look at its effect on the abundance of
haloes and their clustering. We adopt a growth of Poisson fluctuations that starts only after the
moment of matter and radiation equality and study both monochromatic and extended Press-Schechter
distributions. We present updated monochromatic black hole mass constraints by demanding <10%
deviations from the Lambda cold dark matter power spectrum at a scale of k=1h/Mpc. Our results show
that PBHs with masses >10^4M_sun/h are excluded from conforming all of the dark matter in the Universe;
they would, however, be able to act as seeds for super massive black holes if they conform a small fraction
of the DM. We also apply this condition to our extended Press-Schechter (PS) mass functions, and
find that the Poisson power is scale dependent even before applying evolution, due to the change
of the mass density in PBHs with redshift, and therefore with scale, as they start affecting the gravitational
potential at different times. We find that characteristic masses M*<10^2M_sun/h are allowed,
leaving only two characteristic PBH mass windows of PS mass functions when combining with previous
constraints, at M*~10^2M_sun/h and ~10^-8M_sun/h where all of the DM can be in PBHs. The resulting
dark matter halo mass functions within these windows are similar to those resulting from cold dark
matter made of fundamental particles, but as soon as the parameters produce unrealistic P(k), the
resulting halo mass functions and their bias as a function of halo mass deviate strongly from the
behaviour measured in the real Universe

We develop an automatic bubble-recognition routine based on Minkowski functionals (MF) and tensors
(MT) to detect bubble-like interstellar structures in optical emission line images. Minkowski
functionals and MT are powerful mathematical tools for parameterizing the shapes of bodies. Using
the papaya2-library, we created maps of the desired MF or MT of structures at a given window size.
We used maps of the irreducible MT $\psi_2$, which is sensitive to elongation, to find filamentary
regions in H$\alpha$, [SII], and [OIII] images of the Magellanic Cloud Emission Line Survey (MCELS).
Using the phase of $\psi_2$, we were able to draw lines perpendicular to each filament and thus obtain
line-density maps. This allowed us to find the center of a bubble-like structure and to detect structures
at different window sizes. The detected bubbles in all bands are spatially correlated to the distribution
of massive stars, showing that we indeed detect interstellar bubbles without large spatial bias.
Eighteen out of 59 supernova remnants in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) and 13 out of 20 superbubbles
are detected in at least one wavelength. The lack of detection is mostly due to surrounding emission
that disturbs the detection, a too small size, or the lack of a (circular) counterpart in our emission
line images. In line-density maps at larger scales, maxima can be found in regions with high star
formation in the past, often inside supergiant shells (SGS). In SGS LMC 2, there is a maximum west
of the shell where a collision of large gas clouds is thought to have occurred. In the Small Magellanic
Cloud (SMC), bubble detection is impaired by the more complex projected structure of the galaxy.
Line maps at large scales show large filaments in the SMC in a north-south direction, especially
in the [SII] image. The origin of these filaments is unknown.

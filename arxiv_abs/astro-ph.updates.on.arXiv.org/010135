Hot subdwarf stars of types O and B represent a poorly understood phase in the evolution of low-mass
stars. Many subdwarfs show rich oscillations and are among the most chemically peculiar stars known.
Two intermediate He-rich hot subdwarf stars, LS IV-14$^\circ$116 and Feige 46, are particularly
interesting, because they show extreme enrichments of heavy elements such as Ge, Sr, Y, and Zr, strikingly
similar in both stars. Also their light oscillations are similar, but occur at periods incompatible
with standard pulsation theory. We investigate the metal abundances in both stars and validate
the pulsations in Feige 46 using its recent TESS light curve. High-resolution spectroscopy is combined
with non-LTE model atmospheres calculated with Tlusty and Synspec to determine metal abundances
consistently. Many lines are identified with transitions originating from Ga III, Ge III-IV, Se
III, Kr III, Sr II-III, Y III, Zr III-IV, and Sn IV, most of which have not been observed so far in any
star. The abundances of 19 metals in both stars are almost identical, light metals being slightly
more abundant in Feige 46 while Zr, Sn, and Pb are slightly less enhanced compared to LS IV$-$14$^\circ$116.
Both abundance patterns are distinctively different from those of He-poor subdwarfs of similar
temperature. The enrichment in heavy metals of more than 4 dex compared to the Sun is likely the result
of strong atmospheric diffusion processes while the stars' similar patterns of C, N, O, and Ne abundances
might provide clues to their as yet unclear evolutionary history. Finally, we find that the periods
of the pulsation modes in Feige 46 are stable to better than $\dot{P} \lesssim 10^{-8}$ s/s. This
is not compatible with $\dot P$ predicted for pulsations driven by the $\epsilon$-mechanism and
excited by helium-shell flashes in a star which is evolving, for example, onto the extended horizontal
branch.

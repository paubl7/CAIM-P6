The origin of the slow solar wind is still an open issue. It has been suggested that upflows at the edge
of active regions (AR) can contribute to the slow solar wind. Here, we compared the upflow region
and the AR core and studied how the plasma properties change from the chromosphere via the transition
region to the corona. We studied limb-to-limb observations NOAA 12687 (14th - 25th Nov 2017). We
analysed spectroscopic data simultaneously obtained from IRIS and Hinode/EIS in six spectral
lines. We studied the mutual relationships between the plasma properties for each emission line,
as well as comparing the plasma properties between the neighbouring formation temperature lines.
To find the most characteristic spectra, we classified the spectra in each wavelength using the
machine learning technique k-means. We found that in the upflow region the Doppler velocities of
the coronal lines are strongly correlated, but the transition region and coronal lines show no correlation.
However, their fluxes are strongly correlated. The upflow region has lower density and lower temperature
than the AR core. In the upflow region, the Doppler and non-thermal velocity show a strong correlation
in the coronal lines, but the correlation is not seen in the AR core. At the boundary between the upflow
region and the AR core, the upflow region shows an increase in the coronal non-thermal velocity,
the emission obtained from the DEM, and the domination of the redshifted regions in the chromosphere.
The obtained results suggest that at least three parallel mechanisms generate the plasma upflow:
(1) the reconnection between closed loops and open magnetic field lines in the lower corona or upper
chromosphere; (2) the reconnection between the chromospheric small-scale loops and open magnetic
field; (3) the expansion of the magnetic field lines that allows the chromospheric plasma to escape
to the solar corona.

Methods. We perform numerical simulations of the evolution of the cosmic web for the conventional
LCDM model. The simulations cover a wide range of box sizes L = 256 - 4000 Mpc/h, mass and force resolutions
and epochs from very early moments z = 30 to the present moment z = 0. We calculate density fields with
various smoothing lengths to find the dependence of the density field on smoothing scale. We calculate
PDF and its moments - variance, skewness and kurtosis. Results. We focus on the third (skewness S)
and fourth (kurtosis K) moments of the distribution functions: their dependence on the smoothing
scale, the amplitude of fluctuations and the redshift. During the evolution the reduced skewness
$S_3= S/\sigma$ and reduced kurtosis $S_4=K/\sigma^2$ present a complex behaviour: at a fixed
redshift curves of $S_3(\sigma)$ and $S_4(\sigma)$ steeply increase with $\sigma$ at $\sigma\le
1$ and then flatten out and become constant at $\sigma\ge2$. If we fix the smoothing scale $R_t$,
then after reaching the maximum at $\sigma\approx 2$, the curves at large $\sigma$ start to gradually
decline. We provide accurate fits for the evolution of $S_{3,4}(\sigma,z)$. Skewness and kurtosis
approach at early epochs constant levels, depending on smoothing length: $S_3(\sigma) \approx
3$ and $S_4(\sigma) \approx 15$. Conclusions. Most of statistics of dark matter clustering (e.g.,
halo mass function or concentration-mass relation) are nearly universal: they mostly depend on
the $\sigma$ with the relatively modest correction to explicit dependence on the redshift. We find
just the opposite for skewness and kurtosis: the dependence of moments on evolutionary epoch $z$
and smoothing length $R_t$ is very different, together they determine the evolution of $S_{3,4}(\sigma)$
uniquely. The evolution of $S_3$ and $S_4$ cannot be described by current theoretical approximations.

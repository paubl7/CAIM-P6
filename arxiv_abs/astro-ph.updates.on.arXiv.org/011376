The presence of A/F-type {\it Kepler} hybrid stars extending across the entire $\delta$ Sct-$\gamma$
Dor instability strips and beyond remains largely unexplained. In order to better understand these
particular stars, we performed a multi-epoch spectroscopic study of 49 candidate A/F-type hybrid
stars and one cool(er) hybrid object detected by the {\it Kepler} mission. We determined a lower
limit of 27 % for the multiplicity fraction. For six spectroscopic systems, we also reported long-term
variations of the time delays. For four systems, the time delay variations are fully coherent with
those of the radial velocities and can be attributed to orbital motion. We aim to improve the orbital
solutions for those systems with long orbital periods (order of 4-6 years) among the {\it Kepler}
hybrid stars. The orbits are computed based on a simultaneous modelling of the RVs obtained with
high-resolution spectrographs and the photometric time delays derived from time-dependent frequency
analyses of the {\it Kepler} light curves. We refined the orbital solutions of four spectroscopic
systems with A/F-type {\it Kepler} hybrid component stars: KIC 4480321, 5219533, 8975515 and KIC
9775454. Simultaneous modelling of both data types analysed together enabled us to improve the
orbital solutions, obtain more robust and accurate information on the mass ratio, and identify
the component with the short-period $\delta$ Sct-type pulsations. In several cases, we were also
able to derive new constraints for the minimum component masses. From a search for regular frequency
patterns in the high-frequency regime of the Fourier transforms of each system, we found no evidence
of tidal splitting among the triple systems with close (inner) companions. However, some systems
exhibit frequency spacings which can be explained by the mechanism of rotational splitting.

We investigate high resolution imaging polarimetry of HD 169142 taken in the R' and I' bands with
the SPHERE/ZIMPOL instrument for an accurate quantitative measurement of the radiation scattered
by the circumstellar disk. We observe a strong dependence of the disk polarimetry on the atmospheric
turbulences, which strongly impact the AO performance. With our non-coronagraphic data we can
analyze the polarimetric signal of the disk simultaneously with the strongly variable stellar
PSF, correct for the convolution effects to determine the intrinsic polarization of the disk with
high precision. We also extract the disk intensity signal and derive the fractional polarization.
We compare the scattered flux from the inner and outer disk rings with the corresponding thermal
dust emissions measured in the IR and estimate the ratio between scattered and absorbed radiation.
We obtain ratios between the integrated disk polarization flux and total system flux of 0.43% for
the R' band and 0.55% for the I' band. This indicates a reddish color for the light reflection by the
dust. The inner disk ring contributes about 75% to the total disk flux. The obtained fractional polarization
for the bright inner disk ring is 23.6% for the I' band and similar for the R' band. The ratio between
scattered disk flux and star flux is about 2.3%. This is much smaller than the derived IR excess of
17.6% for the disk components observed in scattered light. This indicates that only a small fraction
of the radiation illuminating the disk is scattered; most is absorbed and reemitted in the IR. We
conclude that accurate, quantitative measurements of the scattered light from circumstellar
disks are possible with ground based high contrast AO systems, if the PSF convolution effects are
properly taken into account, and this provides important new constraints on the properties of the
scattering dust.

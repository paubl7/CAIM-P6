Context. Spatially resolved observations of the ionized and molecular gas are critical for understanding
the physical processes that govern the interstellar medium (ISM) in galaxies. Aims. To study the
morpho-kinematic properties of the ionized and molecular gas in three dusty starburst galaxies
at $z = 0.12-0.17$ to explore the relation between molecular ISM gas phase dynamics and the star-formation
activity. Methods. We analyse $\sim$kpc-scale ALMA CO(1--0) and seeing limited SINFONI Paschen-$\alpha$
observations. We use a dynamical mass model, which accounts for beam-smearing effects, to constrain
the CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor. Results. One starburst galaxy shows irregular morphology
which may indicate a major merger, while the other two systems show disc-like morpho-kinematics.
The two disc-like starbursts show molecular gas velocity dispersion values comparable with that
seen in local LIRG/ULIRGs, but in an ISM with molecular gas fraction and surface density values consistent
to that reported for local star-forming galaxies. These molecular gas velocity dispersion values
can be explained by assuming vertical pressure equilibrium. The star-formation activity is correlated
with the molecular gas content suggesting depletion times of the order of $\sim 0.1-1$ Gyr. The star
formation rate surface density ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$) correlates with the ISM pressure set by self-gravity
($P_{\rm grav}$) following a power law with an exponent close to 0.8. Conclusions. In dusty disc-like
starburst galaxies, our data support the scenario in which the molecular gas velocity dispersion
values are driven by the ISM pressure set by self-gravity, responsible to maintain the vertical
pressure balance. The correlation between $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ and $P_{\rm grav}$ suggests that,
in these dusty starbursts galaxies, the star formation activity arises as a consequence of the ISM
pressure balance.

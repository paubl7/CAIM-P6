Reaching the sufficient sensitivity to detect primordial B-modes requires modern CMB polarisation
experiments to rely on new technologies, necessary for the deployment of arrays thousands of detectors
with a broad frequency coverage and operating them for extended periods of time. This increased
complexity of experimental design unavoidably introduces new instrumental and systematic effects,
which may impact performance of the new instruments. In this work we extend the standard data analysis
pipeline by including a (parametric) model of instrumental effects directly in the data model.
We then correct for them in the analysis, accounting for the additional uncertainty in the final
results. We embed these techniques within a general, end-to-end formalism for estimating the impact
of the instrument and foreground models on constraints on the amplitude of the primordial B-mode
signal. We focus on the parametric component separation approach which we generalize to allow for
simultaneous estimation of instrumental and foreground parameters. We demonstrate the framework
by studying the effects induced by an achromatic half-wave plate (HWP), which lead to a frequency-dependent
variation of the instrument polarisation angle, and experimental bandpasses which define observational
frequency bands. We assume a typical Stage-3 CMB polarisation experiment, and show that maps recovered
from raw data collected at each frequency band will unavoidably be linear mixtures of the Q and U Stokes
parameters. We then derive a new generalized data model appropriate for such cases, and extend the
component separation approach to account for it. We find that some of the instrumental parameters,
in particularly those describing the HWP can be successfully constrained by the data themselves
without need for external information, while others, like bandpasses, need to be known with good
precision in advance.

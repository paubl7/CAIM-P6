We investigate the formation and early evolution of a protostellar disc from a magnetized pre-stellar
core using non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations including ambipolar diffusion and
Ohmic dissipation. The dynamical contraction of the pre-stellar core ultimately leads to the formation
of a first hydrostatic core, after ambipolar diffusion decouples the magnetic field from the predominantly
neutral gas. The hydrostatic core accumulates angular momentum from the infalling material, evolving
into a rotationally supported torus; this `first hydrostatic torus' then forms an accreting protostar
and a rotationally supported disc. The disc spreads out by gravitational instability, reaching
$\sim$30 au in diameter at $\sim$3 kyr after protostar formation. The total mass and angular momentum
of the protostar-disc system are determined mainly by accretion of gas from an infalling pseudo-disc,
which has low specific angular momentum because of magnetic braking; their removal from the protostar-disc
system by outflow and disc magnetic braking are negligible, in part because the magnetic field is
poorly coupled there. The redistribution of angular momentum within the protostar-disc system
is facilitated mainly by gravitational instability; this allows formation of relatively large
discs even when the specific angular momentum of infalling material is low. We argue that such discs
should remain marginally unstable as they grow (with Toomre $Q\sim 1$-$2$), an idea that is broadly
consistent with recent observational estimates for Class 0/I discs. We discuss the numerical convergence
of our results, and show that properly treating the inner boundary condition is crucial for achieving
convergence at an acceptable computational cost.

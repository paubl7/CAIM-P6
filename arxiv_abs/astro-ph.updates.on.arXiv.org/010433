Cosmology places the strongest current limits on the sum of neutrino masses. Future observations
will further improve the sensitivity and this will require accurate cosmological simulations
to quantify possible systematic uncertainties and to make predictions for nonlinear scales, where
much information resides. However, shot noise arising from neutrino thermal motions limits the
accuracy of simulations. In this paper, we introduce a new method for simulating large-scale structure
formation with neutrinos that accurately resolves the neutrinos down to small scales and significantly
reduces the shot noise. The method works by tracking perturbations to the neutrino phase-space
distribution with particles and reduces shot noise in the power spectrum by a factor of $\mathcal{O}\left(10^2\right)$
at $z=0$ for minimal neutrino masses and significantly more at higher redshifts, without neglecting
the back-reaction caused by neutrino clustering. We prove that the method is part of a family of optimal
methods that minimize shot noise subject to a maximum deviation from the nonlinear solution. Compared
to other methods we find permille level agreement in the matter power spectrum and percent level
agreement in the large-scale neutrino bias, but large differences in the neutrino component on
small scales. A basic version of the method can easily be implemented in existing N-body codes and
makes it possible to run neutrino simulations with significantly reduced particle load. Further
gains are possible by constructing background models based on perturbation theory. A major advantage
of this technique is that it works well for all masses, enabling a consistent exploration of the full
neutrino parameter space.

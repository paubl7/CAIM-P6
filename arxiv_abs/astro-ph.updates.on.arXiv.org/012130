The exquisite measurements of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) fluctuations by Planck allows
us to tightly constrain the amplitude of matter fluctuations at redshift $\sim 1100$ in the $\Lambda$-cold
dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) model. This amplitude can be extrapolated to the present epoch, yielding
constraints on the value of the $\sigma_8$ parameter. On the other hand the abundance of Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(SZ) clusters detected by Planck, with masses inferred by using hydrostatic equilibrium estimates,
leads to a significantly lower value of the same parameter. This discrepancy is often dubbed the
"$\sigma_8$ tension" in the literature and is sometimes regarded as a possible sign of new physics.
Here, we examine a direct determination of $\sigma_8$ at the present epoch in $\Lambda$CDM, and
thereby the cluster mass calibrations using cosmological data at low redshift, namely the measurements
of $f\sigma_8$ from the analysis of the completed Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS): we combine redshift-space
distortions measurements with Planck CMB constraints, X-ray, and SZ cluster counts within the
$\Lambda$CDM framework, but leaving the present day amplitude of matter fluctuations as an independent
parameter (i.e. no extrapolation is made from high-redshift CMB constraints). The calibration
of X-ray and SZ masses are therefore left as free parameters throughout the whole analysis. Our study
yields tight constraints on the aforementioned calibrations, with values entirely consistent
with results obtained from the full combination of CMB and cluster data only. Such agreement suggests
an absence of tension in the $\Lambda$CDM model between CMB-based estimates of $\sigma_8$ and constraints
from low-redshift on $f\sigma_8$ but indicates a tension with the standard calibration of clusters
masses.

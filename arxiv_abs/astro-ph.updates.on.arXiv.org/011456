Context: Asteroids with a diameter of up to a few dozen meters may spin very fast and complete an entire
rotation within a few minutes. These small and fast-rotating bodies are thought to be monolithic
objects because the gravitational force due to their small size is not strong enough to counteract
the strong centripetal force caused by the fast rotation. Additionally, it is not clear whether
the fast spin prevents dust and small particles (regolith) from being kept on their surface. Aims:
We develop a model for constraining the thermal conductivity of the surface of the small, fast-rotating
near-Earth asteroids. This model may suggest whether regolith is likely present on these objects.
Methods: Our approach is based on the comparison of the measured Yarkovsky drift and a predicted
value using a theoretical model that depends on the orbital, physical and thermal parameters of
the object. The necessary parameters are either deduced from statistical distribution derived
for near-Earth asteroids population or determined from observations with associated uncertainty.
With this information, we performed Monte Carlo simulations and produced a probability density
distribution for the thermal conductivity. Results: Applying our model to the superfast rotator
asteroid (499998) 2011 PT, we find that the measured Yarkovsky drift can only be achieved when the
thermal conductivity $K$ of the surface is low. The resulting probability density function for
the conductivity is bimodal, with two most likely values being around 0.0001 and 0.005 W m$^{-1}$
K$^{-1}$. Based on this, we find that the probability that $K$ is lower than 0.1 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$
is at least 95\%. This low thermal conductivity might indicate that the surface of 2011 PT is covered
with a thermal insulating layer, composed of a regolith-like material similar to lunar dust.

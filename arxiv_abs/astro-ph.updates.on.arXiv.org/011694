Accretion is an essential physical process in black-hole X-ray binaries (BHXRBs) and active galactic
nuclei. The properties of accretion flows and their radiation are generally considered to be uniquely
determined by the mass accretion rate of the disk; however, the "hysteresis effect" observed during
outbursts of nearly all BHXRBs seriously challenges this paradigm. The hysteresis effect is referred
to that apparently similar spectral state transitions take place at very different luminosities
during an outburst cycle. Phenomenologically, this effect is also represented as the so-called
"q"-shaped hardness-intensity diagram (HID), which has been proposed as a unified scene for BHXRBs.
However, even with the high cadence pointing observations, the distinctly important rapid-rise
stage has been caught to date in only a few BHXRB outbursts, and it is still limited to narrow energy/wavelength
bands. As a result, there is still lack of a quantitative theoretical interpretation and observational
understanding on the "q"-diagram. Here, we present a detailed time-lag analysis on Insight-HXMT's
intensive monitoring data of a newly found BHXRB, MAXI J1348-630, over a broad energy band (1--150
keV). We find the first observational evidence that the observed time-lag between radiations of
the accretion disk and the corona leads naturally to the hysteresis effect and the "q"-diagram.
Moreover, complemented by the quasi-simultaneous Swift data, we achieve a panorama of the accretion
flow: the hard X-rays from the corona heat the outer disk and induce the corresponding optical brightening;
thereafter, the enhanced accretion rate in the outer disk propagates inwards to the vicinity of
the central black-hole, generating the soft X-rays in the inner disk region, at a viscous timescale
of $\sim 8-12$ days.

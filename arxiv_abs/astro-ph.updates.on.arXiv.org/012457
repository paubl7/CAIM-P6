Asteroseismology using space-based telescopes is vital to our understanding of stellar structure
and evolution. {\textit{CoRoT}}, {\textit{Kepler}}, and {\textit{TESS}} space telescopes
have detected large numbers of solar-like oscillating evolved stars. %(kaynaklar, Kallinger,
vb ). Solar-like oscillation frequencies have an important role in the determination of fundamental
stellar parameters; in the literature, the relations between the two is established by the so-called
scaling relations. % These scaling relations are in better agreement with mass and radius of main-sequence
stars with large separation ($\Delta\nu$) and frequency of maximum amplitude (${\nu_{\rm max}}$).
In this study, we analyse data obtained from the observation of 15 evolved solar-like oscillating
stars using the {\textit{Kepler}} and ground-based %\textit{CoRoT} telescopes. The main purpose
of the study is to determine very precisely the fundamental parameters of evolved stars by constructing
interior models using asteroseismic parameters. We also fit the reference frequencies of models
to the observational reference frequencies caused by the He {\scriptsize II} ionization zone.
The 15 evolved stars are found to have masses and radii within ranges of $0.79$-$1.47$ $M_{\rm sun}$
and $1.60$-$3.15$ $R_{\rm sun}$, respectively. Their model ages range from $2.19$ to $12.75$ Gyr.
%Using a number of methods based on conventional and modified scaling relations and evolutionary
models constructed with using the {\small {MESA}} code, we determine stellar radii, masses and
ages. It is revealed that fitting reference frequencies typically increase the accuracy of asteroseismic
radius, mass, and age. The typical uncertainties of mass and radius are $\sim$ 3-6 and $\sim$ 1-2
per cent, respectively. Accordingly, the differences between the model and literature ages are
generally only a few Gyr.

The present-day envelope of gaseous planets is a relic of how these giant planets originated and
evolved. Measuring their elemental composition therefore presents a powerful opportunity to
answer long-standing questions regarding planet formation. Obtaining precise observational
constraints on the elemental inventory of giant exoplanets has, however, remained challenging
due to the limited simultaneous wavelength coverage of current space-based instruments. Here,
we present thermal emission observations of the non-transiting hot Jupiter $\tau$ Boo b using the
new wide wavelength coverage (0.95$-$2.50$\,\mu$m) and high spectral resolution ($R=70\,000$)
SPIRou spectrograph. By combining a total of 20 hours of SPIRou data obtained over five nights in
a full atmospheric retrieval framework designed for high-resolution data, we constrain the abundances
of all the major oxygen- and carbon-bearing molecules and recover a non-inverted temperature structure
using a new free-shape, nonparametric TP profile retrieval approach. We find a volume mixing ratio
of log(CO)$\,\,=-2.46_{-0.29}^{+0.25}$ and a highly depleted water abundance of less than $0.0072$
times the value expected for a solar composition envelope. Combined with upper limits on the abundances
of CH$_4$, CO$_2$, HCN, TiO, and C$_2$H$_2$, this results in a gas-phase C/H ratio of 5.85$_{-2.82}^{+4.44}\times\,$solar,
consistent with the value of Jupiter, and an envelope C/O ratio robustly greater than 0.60, even
when taking into account the oxygen that may be sequestered out of the gas-phase. Combined, the inferred
super-solar C/H, O/H, and C/O ratios on $\tau$ Boo b support a formation scenario beyond the water
snowline in a disk enriched in CO due to pebble drift.

SRG/eROSITA PV observations revealed the A3391/95 cluster system and the Northern Clump (MCXC
J0621.7-5242 galaxy cluster) are aligning along a cosmic filament in soft X-rays, similarly to
what has been seen in simulations before. We aim to understand the dynamical state of the Northern
Clump as it enters the atmosphere ($3\times R_{200}$) of A3391. We analyzed joint eROSITA, XMM-Newton,
and Chandra observations to probe the morphological, thermal, and chemical properties of the Northern
Clump from its center out to a radius of 1077 kpc ($1.1\times R_{200}$). We utilized the ASKAP/EMU
radio data, DECam optical image, and Planck y-map to study the influence of the WAT radio source on
the Northern Clump central ICM. From the Magneticum simulation, we identified an analog of the A3391/95
system along with an infalling group resembling the Northern Clump. The Northern Clump is a WCC cluster
centered on a WAT radio galaxy. The gas temperature over $0.2-0.5R_{500}$ is $k_BT_{500}=1.99\pm0.04$
keV. We employed the $M-T$ scaling relation and obtained a mass estimate of $M_{500}=(7.68\pm0.43)\times10^{13}M_{\odot}$
and $R_{500}=(636\pm12)$ kpc. Its atmosphere has a boxy shape and deviates from spherical symmetry.
We identify a southern surface brightness edge, likely caused by subsonic motion relative to the
filament gas. At $\sim\! R_{500}$, the southern atmosphere appears to be 42% hotter than its northern
atmosphere. We detect a downstream tail pointing towards north with a projected length of $\sim318$
kpc, plausibly the result of ram pressure stripping. The analog group in the Magneticum simulation
is experiencing changes in its gas properties and a shift between the position of the halo center
and that of the bound gas, while approaching the main cluster pair.

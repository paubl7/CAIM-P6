Massive and very massive stars play important roles in stellar populations by ejecting strong stellar
winds and exploding in energetic phenomena. It is therefore of high importance that their behaviour
is properly accounted for in synthetic model populations. We present nine grids of stellar evolutionary
model sequences, together with finely resolved interpolated sequences and synthetic populations,
of stars with 9-500 Msun and with metallicities ranging from Galactic down to 1/250 lower. The stellar
models have been computed with the 'Bonn' evolutionary code with consistent physical ingredients,
and covering core-hydrogen- as well as core-helium-burning phases, both complete. The interpolation
and population synthesis have been performed by our newly developed routine 'synStars'. Eight
of the grids represent slowly rotating massive stars with normal/classical evolution, while one
grid represents fast rotating, chemically-homogeneously evolving models. The grids contain
data on stellar wind properties such as estimated wind velocity and kinetic energy of the wind as
well as common stellar parameters such as mass, radius, surface temperature, luminosity, mass
loss rate and surface abundances of 34 isotopes. We also provide estimates of the helium and carbon-oxygen
core mass for calculating the mass of stellar remnants. The 'Bonn' Optimized Stellar Tracks (BoOST)
project is published as simple tables -- including stellar models, interpolated tracks and synthetic
populations. Thus, BoOST is ideal for further scientific applications such as star-formation
studies covering a broad metallicity range, as well as simulations of high-redshift galaxies.
Additionally, gravitational-wave event rate predictions could be refined using BoOST by accounting
for very massive stars at low-metallicity.

A radiative transfer model was used to reproduce several millions of OMEGA (Observatoire pour la
Min\'eralogie, l'Eau, les Glaces et l'Activit\'e) spectra representative of igneous terrains
of Mars. This task provided the modal composition and grain sizes at a planetary scale. The lithology
can be summarized in five mineral maps at km-scale. We found that the low albedo equatorial regions
of the Martian surface (from 60{\deg}S to 30{\deg}N) are globally dominated by plagioclase with
average abundance ~50 vol% and pyroxenes with total averaged abundance close to 40 vol%. An evolution
of the LCP/(LCP+HCP) ratio is observed with time at the global scale, suggesting an evolution of
the degree of partial melting throughout the Martian eras. Olivine and Martian dust are minor components
of the modelled terrains. The olivine distribution is quite different from the other minerals because
it is found on localized areas with abundance reaching 20 vol%. A statistical approach, to classify
the pixels of the abundances maps, using k-means clustering, highlighted seven distinct mineral
assemblages on the surface. This classification illustrates that diverse mineralogical units
are found in the Noachian and Hesperian terrains, which suggests the presence of various and complex
magmatic processes at a global scale during the two oldest eras. The chemical composition was derived
from the modal composition maps. The OMEGA-derived chemical composition is quite consistent with
several distinctive geochemical characteristics previously considered as fingerprints of the
Martian surface. A major discrepancy is in regards to the Fe content that is significantly smaller
than soil and rock analyses from GRS and in situ measurements. The discrepancy could be partly explained
by the assumptions used for the spectral modelling or could also indicate surface alteration rinds.

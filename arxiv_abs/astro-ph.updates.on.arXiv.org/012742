Tracing the emergence of the massive quiescent galaxy (QG) population requires the build-up of
reliable quenched samples. We present Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/G141 grism spectra of 10 quiescent
galaxy candidates selected at $2.5<z<3.5$ in the COSMOS field. Spectroscopic confirmation for
the whole sample is obtained within 1-3 orbits based on the presence of strong spectral breaks and
Balmer absorption lines. Combining their spectra with optical to near-IR photometry, star-forming
solutions are formally rejected for the entire sample. Broad spectral indices are consistent with
the presence of young A-type stars, which implies that the last major episode of star formation has
taken place no earlier than $\sim$300-800 Myr prior to observation. Marginalising over three different
slopes of the dust attenuation curve, we obtain short mass-weighted ages and an average peak star
formation rate of SFR$\sim10^3$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z_{formation}\sim3.5$. Despite mid-
and far-IR data are too shallow to determine the obscured SFR on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis, the mean
stack emission from 3GHz data constrains the level of residual obscured SFR to be globally below
50 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, hence three times below the scatter of the coeval main sequence. Alternatively,
the very same radio detection suggests a widespread radio-mode feedback by active galactic nuclei
(AGN) four times stronger than in z$\sim$1.8 massive QGs. This is accompanied by a 30% fraction of
X-ray luminous AGN with a black hole accretion rate per unit SFR enhanced by a factor of $\sim30$ with
respect to similarly massive QGs at lower redshift. The average compact, high S\'ersic index morphologies
of our galaxies, coupled with their young mass-weighted ages, suggest that the mechanisms responsible
for the development of a spheroidal component might be concomitant with (or preceding) those causing
their quenching.

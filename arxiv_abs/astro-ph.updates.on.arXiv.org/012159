This work proposes a thermophysical model for realistic surface layers on airless small bodies
(RSTPM), for the use of interpreting their multi-epoch thermal lightcurves (e.g WISE/NEOWISE).
RSTPM considers real orbital cycle, rotation cycle, rough surface, temperature dependent thermal
parameters, as well as contributions of sunlight reflection to observations, hence being able
to produce precise temperature distribution and thermal emission of airless small bodies regarding
the variations in orbital time scales. Details of the physics, mathematics and numerical algorithms
of RSTPM are presented. When used to interpret multi-epoch thermal lightcurves by WISE/NEOWISE,
RSTPM can give constraints on the spin orientation and surface physical properties, like mean thermal
inertia or mean size of dust grains, roughness fraction, albedo and so on via radiometric procedure.
As an application example, we apply this model to the main-belt object (24) Themis, the largest object
of the Themis family, which is believed to be the source region of many main-belt comets. We find multi-epoch
(2010, 2014-2018) observations of Themis by WISE/NEOWISE, yielding 18 thermal lightcurves. By
fitting these data with RSTPM, best-fit spin orientation of Themis is derived to be ($\lambda=137^\circ$,
$\beta=59^\circ$) in ecliptic coordinates, the mean radius of dust grains on the surface is estimated
to be $\tilde{b}=140^{+500}_{-114}(6\sim640)~\mu$m, indicating the surface thermal inertia
to vary from $\sim3\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$ to $\sim60\rm~Jm^{-2}s^{-0.5}K^{-1}$ due to
seasonal temperature variation. Further analysis found that thermal light curves of Themis show
a weak rotation-phase dependent feature, indicative of heterogeneous thermal properties or imperfections
of lightcurve inversion shape model.

Protoplanetary disks contain structures such as gaps, rings, and spirals, which are thought to
be produced by the interaction between the disk and embedded protoplanets. However, only a few planet
candidates are found orbiting within protoplanetary disks, and most of them are being challenged
as having been confused with disk features. We aim to discover more proto-planetary candidates
with MUSE, with a secondary aim of improving the high-resolution spectral differential imaging
(HRSDI) technique by analyzing the instrumental residuals of MUSE. We analyzed MUSE observations
of five young stars and applied the HRSDI technique to perform high-contrast imaging. With a 30 min
integration time, MUSE can reach 5$\sigma$ detection limits in apparent H$\alpha$ line flux down
to 10$^{-14}$ and 10$^{-15}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ at 0.075" and 0.25", respectively. In addition
to PDS 70 b and c, we did not detect any clear accretion signatures in PDS 70, J1850-3147, and V1094
Sco down to 0.1". MUSE avoids the small sample statistics problem by measuring the noise characteristics
in the spatial direction at multiple wavelengths. We detected two asymmetric atomic jets in HD 163296.
The HRSDI technique when applied to MUSE data allows us to reach the photon noise limit at small separations
(i.e., < 0.5"). With a higher spectral resolution, MUSE can achieve fainter detection limits in
apparent line flux than SPHERE/ZIMPOL by a factor of $\sim$5. MUSE has some instrumental issues
that limit the contrast that appear in cases with strong point sources, which can be either a spatial
point source due to high Strehl observations or a spectral point source due to a high line-to-continuum
ratio. We modified the HRSDI technique to better handle the instrumental artifacts and improve
the detection limits.

We use the statistical power of the MaNGA integral-field spectroscopic galaxy survey to improve
the definition of strong line diagnostic boundaries used to classify gas ionization properties
in galaxies. We detect line emission from 3.6 million spaxels distributed across 7400 individual
galaxies spanning a wide range of stellar masses, star formation rates, and morphological types,
and find that the gas-phase velocity dispersion sigma_HAlpha correlates strongly with traditional
optical emission line ratios such as [S II]/HAlpha, [N II]/HAlpha, [O I]/HAlpha, and [O III]/HBeta.
Spaxels whose line ratios are most consistent with ionization by galactic HII regions exhibit a
narrow range of dynamically cold line of sight velocity distributions (LOSVDs) peaked around 25
km/s corresponding to a galactic thin disk, while those consistent with ionization by active galactic
nuclei (AGN) and low-ionization emission-line regions (LI(N)ERs) have significantly broader
LOSVDs extending to 200 km/s. Star-forming, AGN, and LI(N)ER regions are additionally well separated
from each other in terms of their stellar velocity dispersion, stellar population age, HAlpha equivalent
width, and typical radius within a given galaxy. We use our observations to revise the traditional
emission line diagnostic classifications so that they reliably identify distinct dynamical samples
both in two-dimensional representations of the diagnostic line ratio space and in a multi-dimensional
space that accounts for the complex folding of the star forming model surface. By comparing the MaNGA
observations to the SDSS single-fiber galaxy sample we note that the latter is systematically biased
against young, low metallicity star-forming regions that lie outside of the 3 arcsec fiber footprint.

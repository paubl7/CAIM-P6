We test the hypothesis that the observed first-peak (Sr, Y, Zr) and second-peak (Ba) s-process elemental
abundances in low metallicity Milky Way stars ($\text{[Fe/H]} \lesssim -0.5$), and the abundances
of the intervening elements Mo and Ru, can be explained by a pervasive r-process contribution that
originates in neutrino-driven winds from highly-magnetic and rapidly rotating proto-neutron
stars (proto-NSs). To this end, we construct chemical evolution models that incorporate recent
calculations of proto-NS yields in addition to contributions from AGB stars, Type Ia supernovae,
and two alternative sets of yields for massive star winds and core collapse supernovae. For non-rotating
massive star yields from either set, models without proto-NS winds underpredict the observed s-process
peak abundances by $0.3$-$1\,\text{dex}$ at low metallicity, and they severely underpredict
Mo and Ru at all metallicities. Models that include the additional wind yields predicted for proto-NSs
with spin periods $P \sim 2$-$5\,\text{ms}$ fit the observed trends for all these elements well.
Alternatively, models that omit proto-NS winds but adopt yields of rapidly rotating massive stars,
with $v_{\rm rot}$ between $150$ and $300\,\text{km}\,\text{s}^{-1}$, can explain the observed
abundance levels reasonably well for $\text{[Fe/H]}<-2$. These models overpredict [Sr/Fe] and
[Mo/Fe] at higher metallicities, but with a tuned dependence of $v_{\rm rot}$ on stellar metallicity
they might achieve an acceptable fit at all [Fe/H]. If many proto-NSs are born with strong magnetic
fields and short spin periods, then their neutrino-driven winds provide a natural source for Sr,
Y, Zr, Mo, Ru, and Ba in low metallicity stellar populations. Spherical winds from unmagnetized
proto-NSs, on the other hand, overproduce the observed Sr, Y, and Zr abundances by a large factor.

We explore the cosmological multitracer synergies between an emission line galaxy distribution
from the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and a Tianlai Project 21-cm intensity map. We use
simulated maps generated from a particle simulation in the light-cone volume (Horizon Run 4), sky-trimmed
and including the effects of foreground contamination, its removal and instrument noise. We first
validate how the foreground residual affects the recovered 21-cm signal by putting different levels
of foreground contamination into the 21-cm maps. We find that the contamination cannot be ignored
in the angular autocorrelation power spectra of HI even when it is small, but has no influence on the
accuracy of the angular cross-power spectra between HI and galaxies. In the foreground-cleaned
map case, as information is lost in the cleaning procedure, there is also a bias in the cross-correlation
power spectrum. However, we found that the bias from the cross-correlation power spectrum is scale-independent,
which is easily parameterized as part of the model, while the offset in the HI autocorrelation power
spectrum is non-linear. In particular, we tested that the cross-correlation power also benefits
from the cancellation of the bias in the power spectrum measurement that is induced by the instrument
noise, which changes the shape of the autocorrelation power spectra but leaves the cross-correlation
power unaffected. We then modelled the angular cross-correlation power spectra to fit the baryon
acoustic oscillation feature in the broad-band shape of the angular cross-correlation power spectrum,
including contamination from the residual foreground and the effect of instrument noise. We forecast
a constraint on the angular diameter distance $D_\mathrm{A}$ for the Tianlai Pathfinder redshift
$0.775<z<1.03$, giving a distance measurement with a precision of 2.7\% at that redshift.

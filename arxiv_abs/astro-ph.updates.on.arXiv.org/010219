The Classical Kuiper Belt is populated by a group of objects with low inclination orbits, reddish
colors and usually belonging to a binary system. This so called Cold Classical Kuiper Belt is considered
to have been formed in situ from primordial ice pebbles that coagulated into planetesimals hundreds
of kilometers in diameter. According to this scenario, the accretion of pebbles into large planetesimals
would have occurred through the streaming instability mechanism that would be effective in the
primordial Solar System disk of gas and solids. Nevertheless other objects with the same color characteristics
as those found in the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt can be encountered also past the 2:1 mean motion resonance
with Neptune as scattered or detached objects. Here I propose a mechanism that can account for both
the cold Classical Kuiper Belt objects and other reddish objects outside the Classical Kuiper Belt.
According to the proposed scenario, reddish objects were primordially in the outer portion of the
planetesimal disk which was however truncated somewhere below 42 au. In this manner the cold Classical
Kuiper Belt and its scattered / detached counterpart were respectively transported outwards by
a short range or slightly scattered to their present locations. Resonant objects were also formed
by the same process. This mechanism is aimed at explaining the distribution of all objects that share
the same color characteristics as coming from a common origin in the outer borders of the primordial
planetesimal disk. According to the scenario here proposed the Cold Classical Kuiper Belt would
have been formed around 4 au inside its present location with a total mass 20 to 100 times as large as
its present value.

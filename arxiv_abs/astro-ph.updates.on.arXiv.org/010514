Studying the stellar kinematics of galaxies is a key tool in the reconstruction of their evolution.
However, the current measurements of the stellar kinematics are complicated by several factors,
including dust extinction and the presence of multiple stellar populations. We use integral field
spectroscopic data of four galaxies from the TIMER survey to explore and compare the kinematics
measured in different spectral regions that are sensitive to distinct stellar populations. We
derive the line-of-sight velocity and velocity dispersion of both a young (<2 Gyr) and an old stellar
population from the spectral regions around the H$\beta$ line and the Ca II Triplet. In addition
we obtain colour excess, mean age, and metallicity. We report a correlation of the colour excess
with the difference in the kinematic parameters of the H$\beta$ line and the Ca II Triplet range,
which are dominated by young and old stellar populations, respectively. Young stellar populations,
located primarily in nuclear rings, have higher velocity dispersions than old ones. These differences
in the rings are typically 10 km/s in velocity dispersion, but up to a mean value of 24 km/s in the most
extreme case. Trends with age exist in the nuclear rings but are less significant than those with
dust extinction. We report different degrees of correlation of these trends among the galaxies
in the sample, which are related to the size of the Voronoi bins in their rings. No clear trends for
the difference of line-of-sight velocity are observed. The absence of these trends can be explained
as a consequence of the masking process of the H$\beta$ line during the kinematic extraction, as
confirmed by dedicated simulations. Our study demonstrates that kinematic differences caused
by different stellar populations can be identified in the central regions of nearby galaxies even
from intermediate resolution spectroscopy.

We present new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array Band 7 observational results of a
Lyman break galaxy at $ z=7.15 $, B14-65666 ("Big Three Dragons"), which is an object detected in
[OIII] 88 $\rm{\mu m}$, [CII] 158 $\rm{\mu m}$, and dust-continuum emission during the epoch of
reionization. Our targets are the [NII] 122 $\rm{\mu m}$ fine-structure emission line and underlying
120 $\rm{\mu m}$ dust continuum. The dust continuum is detected with a $ \sim $19$ \sigma $ significance.
From far-infrared spectral energy distribution sampled at 90, 120, and 160 $\rm{\mu m}$, we obtaine
a best-fit dust temperature of $ 40 $ K ($ 79 $ K) and an infrared luminosity of $ \log_{10}(L_{\rm IR}/{\rm
L}_\odot)=11.6$ ($12.1$) at the emissivity index $ \beta = 2.0 $ (1.0). The [NII] 122 $\rm{\mu m}$
line is not detected. The 3$ \sigma $ upper limit of the [NII] luminosity is $ 8.1 \times 10^7\ {\rm
L}_\odot$. From the [NII], [OIII], and [CII] line luminosities, we use the Cloudy photoionization
code to estimate nebular parameters as functions of metallicity. If the metallicity of the galaxy
is high ($ Z > 0.4\ {\rm Z}_\odot$), the ionization parameter and hydrogen density are $ \log_{10}
U \simeq -2.7\pm0.1$ and $ n_\text{H} \simeq 50$-$250\ {\rm cm}^{-3}$, respectively, which are
comparable to those measured in low-redshift galaxies. The nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio,
$\rm{N/O}$, is constrained to be sub-solar. At $ Z < 0.4\ {\rm Z}_\odot$, the allowed $ U $ drastically
increases as the assumed metallicity decreases. For high ionization parameters, the $\rm{N/O}$
constraint becomes weak. Finally, our Cloudy models predict the location of B14-65666 on the BPT
diagram, thereby allowing a comparison with low-redshift galaxies.

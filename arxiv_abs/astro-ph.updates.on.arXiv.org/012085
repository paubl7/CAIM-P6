We explore the prospects for direct detection of dark energy by current and upcoming terrestrial
dark matter direct detection experiments. If dark energy is driven by a new light degree of freedom
coupled to matter and photons then dark energy quanta are predicted to be produced in the Sun. These
quanta free-stream towards Earth where they can interact with Standard Model particles in the detection
chambers of direct detection experiments, presenting the possibility that these experiments
could be used to test dark energy. Screening mechanisms, which suppress fifth forces associated
with new light particles, and are a necessary feature of many dark energy models, prevent production
processes from occurring in the core of the Sun, and similarly, in the cores of red giant, horizontal
branch, and white dwarf stars. Instead, the coupling of dark energy to photons leads to production
in the strong magnetic field of the solar tachocline via a mechanism analogous to the Primakoff process.
This then allows for detectable signals on Earth while evading the strong constraints that would
typically result from stellar probes of new light particles. As an example, we examine whether the
electron recoil excess recently reported by the XENON1T collaboration can be explained by chameleon-screened
dark energy, and find that such a model is preferred over the background-only hypothesis at the $2.0\sigma$
level, in a large range of parameter space not excluded by stellar (or other) probes. This raises
the tantalizing possibility that XENON1T may have achieved the first direct detection of dark energy.
Finally, we study the prospects for confirming this scenario using planned future detectors such
as XENONnT, PandaX-4T, and LUX-ZEPLIN.

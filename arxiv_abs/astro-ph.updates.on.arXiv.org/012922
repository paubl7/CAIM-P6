Early analyses of exoplanet statistics from the Kepler Mission revealed that a model population
of multiple-planet systems with low mutual inclinations (${\sim1^{\circ}-2^{\circ}}$) adequately
describes the multiple-transiting systems but underpredicts the number of single-transiting
systems. This so-called "Kepler dichotomy" signals the existence of a sub-population of multi-planet
systems possessing larger mutual inclinations. However, the details of these inclinations remain
uncertain. In this work, we derive constraints on the intrinsic mutual inclination distribution
by statistically exploiting Transit Duration Variations (TDVs) of the Kepler planet population.
When planetary orbits are mutually inclined, planet-planet interactions cause orbital precession,
which can lead to detectable long-term changes in transit durations. These TDV signals are inclination-sensitive
and have been detected for roughly two dozen Kepler planets. We compare the properties of the Kepler
observed TDV detections to TDV detections of simulated planetary systems constructed from two
population models with differing assumptions about the mutual inclination distribution. We find
strong evidence for a continuous distribution of relatively low mutual inclinations that is well-characterized
by a power law relationship between the median mutual inclination ($\tilde{\mu}_{i,n}$) and the
intrinsic multiplicity ($n$): $\tilde{\mu}_{i,n} = \tilde{\mu}_{i,5}(n/5)^{\alpha}$, where
$\tilde{\mu}_{i,5} = 1.10^{+0.15}_{-0.11}$ and $\alpha = -1.73^{+0.09}_{-0.08}$. These results
suggest that late-stage planet assembly and possibly stellar oblateness are the dominant physical
origins for the excitation of Kepler planet mutual inclinations.

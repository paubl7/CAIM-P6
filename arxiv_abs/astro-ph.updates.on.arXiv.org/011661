The hypothesis that strange quark matter is the true ground state of matter has been investigated
for almost four decades, but only a few works have explored the dynamics of binary systems of quark
stars. This is partly due to the numerical challenges that need to be faced when modelling the large
discontinuities at the surface of these stars. We here present a novel technique in which the EOS
of a quark star is suitably rescaled to produce a smooth change of the specific enthalpy across a very
thin crust. The introduction of the crust has been carefully tested by considering the oscillation
properties of isolated quark stars, showing that the response of the simulated quark stars matches
accurately the perturbative predictions. Using this technique, we have carried out the first fully
general-relativistic simulations of the merger of quark-star binaries finding several important
differences between quark-star binaries and hadronic-star binaries with the same mass and comparable
tidal deformability. In particular, we find that dynamical mass loss is significantly suppressed
in quark-star binaries. In addition, quark-star binaries have merger and post-merger frequencies
that obey the same quasi-universal relations derived from hadron stars if expressed in terms of
the tidal deformability, but not when expressed in terms of the average stellar compactness. Hence,
it may be difficult to distinguish the two classes of stars if no information on the stellar radius
is available. Finally, differences are found in the distributions in velocity and entropy of the
ejected matter, for which quark-stars have much smaller tails. Whether these differences in the
ejected matter will leave an imprint in the electromagnetic counterpart and nucleosynthetic yields
remains unclear, calling for the construction of an accurate model for the evaporation of the ejected
quarks into nucleons.

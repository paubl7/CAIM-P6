Current hydrodynamical and semi-empirical simulations of galaxy formation and evolution have
difficulties in reproducing the number densities of IR-detected galaxies. Therefore, a versatile,
phenomenological new simulation tool is necessary to reproduce current and predict future observations
at IR wavelengths. In this work we generate simulated catalogues starting from the Herschel infrared
luminosity functions of different galaxy populations, in order to consider in a consistent way
different populations of galaxies and active galactic nuclei. We associated a spectral energy
distribution and physical properties, such as stellar mass, star-formation-rate and AGN contribution,
to each simulated galaxy using a broad set of empirical relations. We compare the resulting simulated
galaxies, extracted up to z$=$10, with a broad set of observational relations. The Spectro-Photometric
Realisations of Infrared-selected Targets at all-z (SPRITZ) simulation will allow us to obtain
in a fully consistent way simulated observations for a broad set of current and future facilities
with photometric capabilities as well as low-resolution IR spectroscopy, like the James Webb Space
Telescope (JWST) or the Origin Space Telescope (OST). The derived simulated catalogue contains
galaxies and active galactic nuclei that by construction reproduce the observed IR galaxy number
density, but it is also in agreement with the observed number counts from UV to far-IR wavelengths,
the observed stellar mass function, the star-formation-rate vs. stellar mass plane and the luminosity
function from the radio to the X-ray. The proposed simulation is therefore ideal to make predictions
for current and future facilities, in particular, but not limited to, those operating at IR wavelengths.
The SPRITZ simulation will be publicly available.

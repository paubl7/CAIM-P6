The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS) has been obtaining near- and far-ultraviolet
images and spectra of the solar atmosphere since July 2013. The unique combination of near and far-ultraviolet
spectra and images at subarcsecond resolution and high cadence allows the tracing of mass and energy
through the critical interface between the solar surface and the corona or solar wind. IRIS has enabled
research into the fundamental physical processes thought to play a role in the low solar atmosphere
such as ion-neutral interactions, magnetic reconnection, the generation, propagation, and dissipation
of various types of waves, the acceleration of non-thermal particles, and various small-scale
instabilities. These new findings have helped provide novel insights into a wide range of phenomena
including the discovery of non-thermal particles in coronal nanoflares, the formation and impact
of spicules and other jets, resonant absorption and dissipation of Alfvenic waves, energy release
associated with braiding of magnetic field lines, the thermal instability in the chromosphere-corona
mass and energy cycle, the contribution of waves, turbulence, and non-thermal particles in the
energy deposition during flares and smaller-scale events such as UV bursts, and the role of flux
ropes and other mechanisms in triggering CMEs. IRIS observations have also advanced studies of
the connections between solar and stellar physics. Advances in numerical modeling, inversion
codes, and machine learning techniques have played a key role in driving these new insights. With
the advent of exciting new instrumentation both on the ground (e.g., DKIST, ALMA) and space-based
(e.g., Parker Solar Probe, Solar Orbiter), we aim to review new insights based on IRIS observations
or related modeling, and highlight some of the outstanding challenges that have been brought to
the fore.

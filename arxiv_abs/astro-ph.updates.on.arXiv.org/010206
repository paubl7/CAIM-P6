Gravitational waves (GW), as light, are gravitationally lensed by intervening matter, deflecting
their trajectories, delaying their arrival and occasionally producing multiple images. In theories
beyond general relativity (GR), new gravitational degrees of freedom add an extra layer of complexity
and richness to GW lensing. We develop a formalism to compute GW propagation beyond GR over general
space-times, including kinetic interactions with new fields. Our framework relies on identifying
the dynamical propagation eigenstates (linear combinations of the metric and additional fields)
at leading order in a short-wave expansion. We determine these eigenstates and the conditions under
which they acquire a different propagation speed around a lens. Differences in speed between eigenstates
cause birefringence phenomena, including time delays between the metric polarizations (orthogonal
superpositions of $h_+,h_\times$) observable without an electromagnetic counterpart. In particular,
GW echoes are produced when the accumulated delay is larger than the signal's duration, while shorter
time delays produce a scrambling of the wave-form. We also describe the formation of GW shadows as
non-propagating metric components are sourced by the background of the additional fields around
the lens. As an example, we apply our methodology to quartic Horndeski theories with Vainshtein
screening and show that birefringence effects probe a region of the parameter space complementary
to the constraints from the multi-messenger event GW170817. In the future, identified strongly
lensed GWs and binary black holes merging near dense environments, such as active galactic nuclei,
will fulfill the potential of these novel tests of gravity.

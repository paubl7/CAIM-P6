The properties of synthetic CO emission from 3D simulations of forming molecular clouds are studied
within the SILCC-Zoom project. Since the time scales of cloud evolution and molecule formation
are comparable, the simulations include a live chemical network. Two sets of simulations with an
increasing spatial resolution (d$x=3.9$ pc to d$x=0.06$ pc) are used to investigate the convergence
of the synthetic CO emission, which is computed by post-processing the simulation data with the
\textsc{radmc-3d} radiative transfer code. To determine the excitation conditions, it is necessary
to include atomic hydrogen and helium alongside $H_2$ and the resulting CO emission is increased
by ~20-30\%. Combining the brightness temperature of $^{12}$CO and $^{13}$CO , we compare different
methods to estimate the excitation temperature, the optical depth of the CO line and hence, the CO
column density. An intensity-weighted average excitation temperature results in the most accurate
estimate of the total CO mass. When the pixel-based excitation temperature is used to calculate
the CO mass, it is over-/underestimated at low/high CO column densities where the assumption that
$^{12}$CO is optically thick while $^{13}$CO is optically thin is not valid. Further, in order to
obtain a converged total CO luminosity and hence <$X_{\rm CO}$> factor, the 3D simulation must have
d$x\lesssim0.1$ pc. The <$X_{\rm CO}$> evolves over time and differs for the two clouds; yet pronounced
differences with numerical resolution are found. Since high column density regions with a visual
extinction larger than 3~mag are not resolved for d$x\gtrsim 1$ pc, in this case the $H_2$ mass and
CO luminosity both differ significantly from the higher resolution results and the local $X_{\rm
CO}$ is subject to strong noise. Our calculations suggest that synthetic CO emission maps are only
converged for simulations with d$x\lesssim0.1$ pc.

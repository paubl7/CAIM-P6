A significative fraction of all massive stars in the Milky Way move supersonically through their
local interstellar medium (ISM), producing bow shock nebulae by wind-ISM interaction. The stability
of these observed astrospheres around cool massive stars challenges precedent two-dimensional
(magneto-)hydrodynamical simulations of their surroundings. We present three-dimensional
magneto-hydrodynamical (3D MHD) simulations of the circumstellar medium of runaway M-type red
supergiant stars moving with velocity v_star= 50 km/s. We treat the stellar wind with a Parker spiral
and assume a 7 microG magnetisation of the ISM. Our free parameter is the angle theta_mag between
ISM flow and magnetisation, taken to 0, 45 and 90 degrees. It is found that simulation dimension,
coordinate systems and grid effects can greatly affect the development of the modelled astrospheres.
Nevertheless, as soon as the ISM flow and magnetisation directions differs by more than a few degrees
(theta_mag>5 degree), the bow shock is stabilised, most clumpiness and ragged structures vanishing.
The complex shape of the bowshocks induce important projection effects, e.g. at optical Ha line,
producing complex of astrospheric morphologies. We speculate that those effects are also at work
around earlier-type massive stars, which would explain their diversity of their observed arc-like
nebula around runaway OB stars. Our 3D MHD models are fitting well observations of the astrospheres
of several runaway red supergiant stars. The results interpret the smoothed astrosphere of IRC-10414
and Betelgeuse aOri) are stabilised by an organised, non-parallel ambient magnetic field. Our
findings suggest that IRC-10414 is currently in a steady state of its evolution, and that Betelgeuse's
bar is of interstellar origin.

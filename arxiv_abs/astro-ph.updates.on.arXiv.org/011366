Supergranules create a peak in the spatial spectrum of photospheric velocity features. They have
some properties of convection cells but their origin is still being debated in the literature. The
time-distance helioseismology constitutes a method that is suitable for investigating the deep
structure of supergranules. Our aim is to construct the model of the flows in the average supergranular
cell using fully consistent time-distance inverse methodology. We used the Multi-Channel Subtractive
Optimally Localised Averaging inversion method with regularisation of the cross-talk. We combined
the difference and the mean travel-time averaging geometries. We applied this methodology to travel-time
maps averaged over more than 10000 individual supergranular cells. These cells were detected automatically
in travel-time maps computed for 64 quiet days around the disc centre. The ensemble averaging method
allows us to significantly improve the signal-to-noise ratio and to obtain a clear picture of the
flows in the average supergranule. We found near-surface divergent horizontal flows which quickly
and monotonously weakened with depth; they became particularly weak at the depth of about 7 Mm, where
they even apparently switched sign. To learn about the vertical component, we integrated the continuity
equation from the surface. The derived estimates of the vertical flow depicted a sub-surface increase
from about 5 m/s at the surface to about 35 m/s at the depth of about 3 Mm followed by a monotonous decrease
to greater depths. The vertical flow remained positive (an upflow) and became indistinguishable
from the background at the depth of about 15 Mm. We further detected a systematic flow in the longitudinal
direction. The course of this systematic flow with depth agrees well with the model of the solar rotation
in the sub-surface layers.

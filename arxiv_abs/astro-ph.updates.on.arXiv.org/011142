Context: The origin of ultra-rapid flares of very high-energy radiation from active galactic nuclei
remains elusive. Magnetospheric processes, occurring in the close vicinity of the central black
hole, could account for these flares. Aims: We aim to bridge the gap between simulations and observations
by synthesizing gamma-ray lightcurves in order to characterize the activity of a black-hole magnetosphere,
using kinetic simulations. Methods: We perform global axisymmetric two-dimensional general-relativistic
particle-in-cell simulations of a Kerr black-hole magnetosphere. We include a self-consistent
treatment of radiative processes and plasma supply, as well as a realistic magnetic configuration,
with a large-scale equatorial current sheet. We couple our particle-in-cell code with a ray-tracing
algorithm, in order to produce synthetic lightcurves. Results: These simulations show a highly
dynamic magnetosphere, as well as very efficient dissipation of the magnetic energy. An external
supply of magnetic flux is found to maintain the magnetosphere in a dynamic state, otherwise the
magnetosphere settles in a quasi-steady Wald-like configuration. The dissipated energy is mostly
converted to gamma-ray photons. The lightcurves at low viewing angle (face-on) mainly trace the
spark gap activity and exhibit high variability. On the other hand, no significant variability
is found at high viewing angle (edge-on), where the main contribution comes from the reconnecting
current sheet. Conclusions: We observe that black-hole magnetospheres with a current sheet are
characterized by a very high radiative efficiency. The typical amplitude of the flares in our simulations
is lower than what is detected in active galactic nuclei. Such flares could result from the variation
of parameters external to the black hole

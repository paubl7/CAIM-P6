Via evaluation of the Lyapunov exponent, we report the discovery of three prominent sets of phase
space regimes of quasi-periodic orbits of charged particles trapped in a dipole magnetic field.
Besides the low energy regime that has been studied extensively and covers more than 10% in each dimension
of the phase space of trapped orbits, there are two sets of high energy regimes, the largest of which
covers more than 4% in each dimension of the phase space of trapped orbits. Particles in these high
energy orbits may be observed in space and be realized in plasma experiments on the Earth. It is well-known
that there are quasi-periodic orbits around stable periodic orbits in Hamiltonian systems with
2 degrees of freedom and these quasi-periodic orbits are stable as well. Since periodic orbits appear
to have a negligible measure in the phase space, they are difficult to realize in nature. Quasi-periodic
orbits, on the other hand, may occupy a finite volume in the 4 dimensional (4D) phase space and be readily
detectable. A chaotic orbit has at least one positive Lyapunov exponent. The Lyapunov exponents
of quasi-periodic orbits, on the other hand, should be zero. Via calculation of the Lyapunov exponent
of orbits of trapped charged particles in a dipole magnetic field, we scanned the corresponding
phase space and found several prominent regimes of quasi-periodic orbits associated with stable
periodic orbits in the equatorial plane. These regimes appear to be connected to some small regimes
of quasi-periodic orbits associated with stable periodic orbits in the Meridian plane. Our numerical
results also show a continuous spectrum of these orbits from stable periodic, to quasi-periodic
with vanishing Lyapunov exponents, and eventually to chaotic ones with at least one positive Lyapunov
exponent and there are unstable periodic orbits with a positive maximum Lyapunov exponent.

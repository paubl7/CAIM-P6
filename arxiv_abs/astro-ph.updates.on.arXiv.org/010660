After protoplanets have acquired sufficient mass to open partial gaps in their natal protostellar
disks, residual gas continues to diffuse onto horseshoe streamlines under effect of viscous dissipation,
and meander in and out of the planets' Hill sphere. Within the Hill sphere, the horseshoe streamlines
intercept gas flow in circumplanetary disks. The host stars' tidal perturbation induces a barrier
across the converging streamlines' interface. Viscous transfer of angular momentum across this
tidal barrier determines the rate of mass diffusion from the horseshoe streamlines onto the circumplanetary
disks, and eventually the accretion rate onto the protoplanets. We carry out a series of numerical
simulations to test the influence of this tidal barrier on super thermal planets. In weakly viscous
disks, protoplanets' accretion rate steeply decreases with their masses above the thermal limit.
As their growth timescale exceeds the gas depletion time scale, their masses reach asymptotic values
comparable to that of Jupiter. In relatively thick and strongly viscous disks, protoplanets' asymptotic
masses exceed several times that of Jupiter. Two dimensional numerical simulations show that such
massive protoplanets strongly excite the eccentricity of nearby horseshoe streamlines, destabilize
orderly flow, substantially enhance the diffusion rate across the tidal barrier, and elevate their
growth rate until their natal disk is severely depleted. In contrast, eccentric streamlines remain
stable in three dimensional simulations. Based on the upper falloff in the observe mass distribution
of known exoplanets, we suggest their natal disks had relatively low viscosity alpha sim 0.001,
modest thickness H/R sim 0.03 to 0.05, and limited masses comparable to that of minimum mass solar
nebula model.

We present a case study of using a novel method to identify red supergiant (RSG) candidates in NGC
6822, based on their 1.6 $\mu$m "H-bump". We collected 32 bands of photometric data for NGC 6822 ranging
from optical to MIR. By using the theoretical spectra from MARCS, we demonstrate that there is a prominent
difference around 1.6 $\mu$m ("H-bump") between low-surface-gravity (LSG) and high-surface-gravity
(HSG) targets. Taking advantage of this feature, we identify efficient color-color diagrams (CCDs)
of rzH and rzK to separate HSG and LSG targets from crossmatching of optical and NIR data. Moreover,
synthetic photometry from ATLAS9 also give similar results. Further separating RSG candidates
from the rest of the LSG candidates is done by using semi-empirical criteria on NIR CMDs and resulted
in 323 RSG candidates. Meanwhile, the simulation of foreground stars from Besan\c{c}on models
also indicates that our selection criteria is largely free from the contamination of Galactic giants.
In addition to the "H-bump" method, we also use the traditional BVR method as a comparison and/or
supplement, by applying a slightly aggressive cut to select as much as possible RSG candidates (358
targets). Furthermore, the Gaia astrometric solution is used to constrain the sample, where 181
and 193 targets were selected from the "H-bump" and BVR method, respectively. The percentages of
selected targets in both methods are similar as $\sim$60\%, indicating the comparable accuracy
of the two methods. In total, there are 234 RSG candidates after combining targets from both methods
with 140 ($\sim$60\%) of them in common. The final RSG candidates are in the expected locations on
the MIR CMDs, while the spatial distribution is also coincident with the FUV-selected star formation
regions, suggesting the selection is reasonable and reliable.

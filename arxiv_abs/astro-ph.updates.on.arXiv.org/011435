The mechanism of thermal driving for launching accretion disk winds is interconnected with classical
thermal instability (TI). Indeed, the effective scale height of irradiated accretion disk atmospheres
is determined by the extent of the cold branch of the S-curve demarcating thermally unstable zones.
In a recent paper, we demonstrated that as a result of this interconnectedness, radial wind solutions
of X-ray heated flows are prone to becoming clumpy. In over two decades of numerical work, however,
only smooth thermally driven disk wind solutions that approach a steady state have been found. In
this paper, we show that the Bernoulli function determines whether or not the entropy mode can grow
due to TI in dynamical flows. Based on this finding, we identify a critical radius, $R_{\rm u}$, beyond
which TI should accompany thermal driving, resulting in clumpy disk wind solutions. Our numerical
simulations reveal that clumpiness is a consequence of buoyancy disrupting the stratified structure
of smooth solutions. Namely, instead of a thin transition layer separating the highly ionized disk
wind from the cold phase atmosphere below, TI seeds the formation of hot spots below the transition
layer that rise up, fragmenting the atmosphere. This results in the continual production of characteristic
cold phase structures that we refer to as irradiated atmospheric fragments (IAFs). These IAFs resemble
tsunamis upon interacting with the disk wind, as crests develop as they are advected outwards. The
multiphase character of these solutions results from the subsequent disintegration of the IAFs,
which takes place within a turbulent wake that reaches high enough elevations in the wind so as to
be observable from sightlines as high as $45^{\degree}$. We discuss the properties of the AMD in
detail, showing that dips in the AMD are not expected within TI zones.

This paper attempts to elucidate how Kerr black holes manage to radiate or self-extract energy through
their force-free magnetospheres with the energy/angular-momentum flux relation $\vcSE=\OmF\vcSJ$,
where $\Omega_{\rm F}(\Psi)$ is the field line angular-velocity, and $\Psi$ is the stream function.
The frame-dragging effect with the angular-velocity $\om$ couples with unipolar induction to
comply with the first and second laws of thermodynamics; the former allows defining the overall
efficiency of extraction $\bar{\eps}=\OmFb/\OmH$ and the latter, together with the radiation
condition toward the hole, yields $0\lo\OmF\approx\OmFb\lo\OmH$; $\OmFb$ is the overall field
line angular-velocity and $\OmH$ is the hole's angular-velocity. This inequality ensures the
existence of the null surface $\SN$ with $\OmFm\equiv\OmF-\om\ggel0$, where $\OmFm$ is the ZAMO-measured
angular-velocity (ZAMOs are zero-angular-momentum-observers). The flux relation is modified
as $\vcSE=\vcSEM+\vcSsd=\OmF\vcSJ$, to adjust to the first law. The Poynting flux $\vcSEM=\OmFm\vcSJ$
will be launched both outward and inward from $\SN$, and the spin-down flux $\vcSsd=\om\vcSJ$ carries
energy outwardly from the hole, keeping the total flux $\vcSE$ constant along each field line. The
freezing-in and force-free conditions break down at $\SN$, where current- and stream-lines are
severed, though magnetic field lines are kept continuous. The voltage drop between the two batteries
at $\SN$ will be at work to produce pair-particles, making the null surface widened to the `zero-angular-momentum-Gap'
filled with charged particles. The boundary condition at $\SN$ yields the eigenvalue of $\OmFb\approx0.5\OmH$
for the `gravito-thermo-electrodynamic' extraction. The magnetosphere will be frame-dragged
into rotation with $\omN\equiv\OmF$ by the hole's spin.

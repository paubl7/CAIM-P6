We have studied the merger rate of primordial black holes (PBHs) in the ellipsoidal-collapse model
of halo to explain the dark matter abundance by the PBH merger estimated from the gravitational waves
detections via the Advanced LIGO (aLIGO) detectors. We have indicated that the PBH merger rate within
each halo for the ellipsoidal models is more significant than for the spherical models. We have specified
that the PBH merger rate per unit time and per unit volume for the ellipsoidal-collapse halo models
is about one order of magnitude higher than the corresponding spherical models. Moreover, we have
calculated the evolution of the PBH total merger rate as a function of redshift. The results indicate
that the evolution for the ellipsoidal halo models is more sensitive than spherical halo models,
as expected from the models. Finally, we have presented a constraint on the PBH abundance within
the context of ellipsoidal and spherical models. By comparing the results with the aLIGO mergers
during the third observing run (O3), we have shown that the merger rate in the ellipsoidal-collapse
halo models falls within the aLIGO window, while the same result is not valid for the spherical-collapse
ones. Furthermore, we have compared the total merger rate of PBHs in terms of their fraction in the
ellipsoidal-collapse halo models for several masses of PBHs. The results suggest that the total
merger rate of PBHs changes inversely with their masses. We have also estimated the relation between
the fraction of PBHs and their masses in the ellipsoidal-collapse halo model and have shown it for
a narrow mass distribution of PBHs. The outcome shows that the constraint inferred from the PBH merger
rate for the ellipsoidal-collapse halo models can be potentially stronger than the corresponding
result obtained for the spherical-collapse ones.

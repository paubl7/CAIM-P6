We develop a systematic and unified approach to estimate all possible secondary (i.e. non-primordial)
nonlinear effects to the cosmic microwave background (CMB) polarization, named curve-of-sight
integration approach. In this approach, the Boltzmann equation for polarized photons is rewritten
in a line-of-sight integral along an exact geodesic in the perturbed universe, rather than a geodesic
in the background universe used in the linear-order CMB calculation. This approach resolves the
difficulty to solve the Boltzmann hierarchy with the nonlinear gravitational effects in the photon
free-streaming regime and thus unifies the standard remapping approach for CMB lensing into the
direct approach solving the Boltzmann equation for the nonlinear collisional effects. In this
paper, we derive formulae that: (i) include all the nonlinear effects; (ii) can treat extended sources
such as the contributions after the reionization. It offers a solid framework to discuss possible
systematics in the standard estimation of CMB lensing by the remapping approach. As an explicit
demonstration, we estimate the secondary B-mode power spectrum induced by all foreground gravitational
effects: lensing, redshift, time-delay, emission-angle, and polarization-rotation effects.
We define these effects properly so that they do not have any overlap, also without overlooking any
effect. Then, we show that these effects only give corrections of the order of 0.001-0.01% to the
standard lensing-induced B-mode power spectrum in the concordance $\Lambda$ cold dark matter
model. Our result confirms the reliability of using the remapping approach in upcoming CMB experiments
aiming to detect the primordial gravitational waves with the tensor-to-scalar ratio of $r \sim
10^{-3}$.

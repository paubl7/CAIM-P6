The nearest stars provide a fundamental constraint for our understanding of stellar physics and
the Galaxy. The nearby sample serves as an anchor where all objects can be seen and understood with
precise data. This work is triggered by the most recent data release of the astrometric space mission
Gaia and uses its unprecedented high precision parallax measurements to review the census of objects
within 10 pc. The first aim of this work was to compile all stars and brown dwarfs within 10 pc observable
by Gaia, and compare it with the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars as a quality assurance test. We complement
the list to get a full 10 pc census, including bright stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets. We started
our compilation from a query on all objects with a parallax larger than 100 mas using SIMBAD. We completed
the census by adding companions, brown dwarfs with recent parallax measurements not in SIMBAD yet,
and vetted exoplanets. The compilation combines astrometry and photometry from the recent Gaia
Early Data Release 3 with literature magnitudes, spectral types and line-of-sight velocities.
We give a description of the astrophysical content of the 10 pc sample. We find a multiplicity frequency
of around 28%. Among the stars and brown dwarfs, we estimate that around 61% are M stars and more than
half of the M stars are within the range M3.0 V to M5.0 V. We give an overview of the brown dwarfs and exoplanets
that should be detected in the next Gaia data releases along with future developments. We provide
a catalogue of 541 stars, brown dwarfs, and exoplanets in 339 systems, within 10 pc from the Sun. This
list is as volume-complete as possible from current knowledge and provides benchmark stars that
can be used, for instance, to define calibration samples and to test the quality of the forthcoming
Gaia releases. It also has a strong outreach potential.

We carried out a systematic study of full-orbit phase curves for known transiting systems in the
northern ecliptic sky that were observed during Year 2 of the TESS primary mission. We applied the
same methodology for target selection, data processing, and light-curve fitting as we did in our
Year 1 study. Out of the 15 transiting systems selected for analysis, seven - HAT-P-7, KELT-1, KELT-9,
KELT-16, KELT-20, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12 - show statistically significant secondary eclipses
and day-night atmospheric brightness modulations. Small eastward dayside hotspot offsets were
measured for KELT-9b and WASP-12b. KELT-1, Kepler-13A, and WASP-12 show additional phase-curve
variability attributed to the tidal distortion of the host star; the amplitudes of these signals
are consistent with theoretical predictions. We combined occultation measurements from TESS
and Spitzer to compute dayside brightness temperatures, TESS-band geometric albedos, Bond albedos,
and phase integrals for several systems. The new albedo values solidify the previously reported
trend between dayside temperature and geometric albedo for planets with $1500<T_{\mathrm{day}}<3000$
K. For Kepler-13Ab, we carried out an atmospheric retrieval of the full secondary eclipse spectrum,
which revealed a non-inverted temperature-pressure profile, significant H$_{2}$O and K absorption
in the near-infrared, evidence for strong optical atmospheric opacity due to sodium, and a confirmation
of the high geometric albedo inferred from our simpler analysis. We explore the implications of
the phase integrals (ratios of Bond to geometric albedos) for understanding exoplanet clouds.
We also report updated transit ephemerides for all of the systems studied in this work.

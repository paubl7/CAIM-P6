Reconstruction techniques for intrinsic quasar continua are crucial for the precision study of
Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly-$\alpha$) and Lyman-$\beta$ (Ly-$\beta$) transmission at $z>5.0$, where
the $\lambda<1215 A$ emission of quasars is nearly completely absorbed. While the number and quality
of spectroscopic observations has become theoretically sufficient to quantify Ly-$\alpha$ transmission
at $5.0<z<6.0$ to better than $1\%$, the biases and uncertainties arising from predicting the unabsorbed
continuum are not known to the same level. In this paper, we systematically evaluate eight reconstruction
techniques on a unified testing sample of $2.7<z<3.5$ quasars drawn from eBOSS. The methods include
power-law extrapolation, stacking of neighbours, and six variants of Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) using direct projection, fitting of components, or neural networks to perform weight mapping.
We find that power-law reconstructions and the PCA with fewest components and smallest training
sample display the largest biases in the Ly-$\alpha$ forest ($-9.58\%/+8.22\%$ respectively).
Power-law extrapolations have larger scatters than previously assumed of $+13.1\%/-13.2\%$
over Ly-$\alpha$ and $+19.9\%/-20.1\%$ over Ly-$\beta$. We present two new PCAs which achieve
the best current accuracies of $9\%$ for Ly-$\alpha$ and $17\%$ for Ly-$\beta$. We apply the eight
techniques after accounting for wavelength-dependent biases and scatter to a sample $19$ quasars
at $z>5.7$ with IR X-Shooter spectroscopy, obtaining well-characterised measurements for the
mean flux transmission at $4.7<z<6.3$. Our results demonstrate the importance of testing and,
when relevant, training, continuum reconstruction techniques in a systematic way.

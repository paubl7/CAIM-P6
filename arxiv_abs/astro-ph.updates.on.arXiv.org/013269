The highly neutral inter-galactic medium (IGM) during the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) is expected
to suppress Ly$\alpha$ emission with damping-wing absorption, causing nearly no Ly$\alpha$ detection
from star-forming galaxies at $z{\sim}8$. However, spectroscopic observations of the 4 brightest
galaxies (${\rm H}_{160}{\sim}25$ mag) at these redshifts do reveal prominent Ly$\alpha$ line,
suggesting locally ionised IGM. In this paper, we explore the Ly$\alpha$ IGM transmission and environment
of bright galaxies during the EoR using the Meraxes semi-analytic model. We find brighter galaxies
to be less affected by damping-wing absorption as they are effective at ionizing surrounding neutral
hydrogen. Specifically, the brightest sources (${\rm H}_{160}{\lesssim}25.5$ mag) lie in the
largest ionized regions in our simulation, and have low attenuation of their Ly$\alpha$ from the
IGM (optical depth ${<}1$). Fainter galaxies (25.5 mag${<}{\rm H}_{160}{<}27.5$ mag) have transmission
that depends on UV luminosity, leading to a lower incidence of Ly$\alpha$ detection at fainter magnitudes.
This luminosity-dependent attenuation explains why Ly$\alpha$ has only been observed in the brightest
galaxies at $z{\sim}8$. Follow-up observations have revealed counterparts in the vicinity of
these confirmed $z{\sim}8$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters. The environments of our modelled analogues agree
with these observations in the number of nearby galaxies, which is a good indicator of whether Ly$\alpha$
can be detected among fainter galaxies. At the current observational limit, galaxies with ${\ge}2$--5
neighbours within $2'{\times}2'$ are ${\sim}2$--3 times more likely to show Ly$\alpha$ emission.
JWST will discover an order of magnitude more neighbours, revealing ${\gtrsim}50$ galaxies in
the largest ionizing bubbles and facilitating direct study of reionization morphology.

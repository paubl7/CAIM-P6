Aims. We study the evolution of rotation and high energy X-ray, extreme ultraviolet (EUV), and Ly-alpha
emission for F, G, K, and M dwarfs, with masses between 0.1 and 1.2 Msun, and provide our evolutionary
code and a freely available set of evolutionary tracks for use in planetary atmosphere studies.
Methods. We develop a physical rotational evolution model constrained by observed rotation distributions
in young stellar clusters. Using rotation, X-ray, EUV, and Ly-alpha measurements, we derive empirical
relations for the dependences of high energy emission on stellar parameters. Our description of
X-ray evolution is validated using measurements of X-ray distributions in young clusters. Results.
A star's X-ray, EUV, and Ly-alpha evolution is determined by its mass and initial rotation rate,
with initial rotation being less important for lower mass stars. At all ages, solar mass stars are
significantly more X-ray luminous than lower mass stars and stars that are born as rapid rotators
remain highly active longer than those born as slow rotators. At all evolutionary stages, habitable
zone planets receive higher X-ray and EUV fluxes when orbiting lower mass stars due to their longer
evolutionary timescales. The rates of flares follow similar evolutionary trends with higher mass
stars flaring more often than lower mass stars at all ages, though habitable zone planets are likely
influenced by flares more when orbiting lower mass stars. Conclusions. Our results show that single
decay-laws are insufficient to describe stellar activity evolution and highlight the need for
a more comprehensive description based on the evolution of rotation, including also the effects
of short-term variability. Planets at similar orbital distances from their host stars receive
significantly more X-ray and EUV energy over their lifetimes when orbiting higher mass stars. (abstract

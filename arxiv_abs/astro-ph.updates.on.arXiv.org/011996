Some ultra-compact dwarf galaxies (UCDs) have elevated observed dynamical V-band mass-to-light
($M/L_{\rm V}$) ratios with respect to what is expected from their stellar populations assuming
a canonical initial mass function (IMF). Observations have also revealed the presence of a compact
dark object in the centers of several UCDs, having a mass of a few to 15\% of the present-day stellar
mass of the UCD. This central mass concentration has typically been interpreted as a super-massive
black hole, but can in principle also be a sub-cluster of stellar remnants. We explore the following
two formation scenarios of UCDs, i) monolithic collapse and ii) mergers of star clusters in cluster
complexes as are observed in massively star-bursting regions. We explore the physical properties
of the UCDs at different evolutionary stages assuming different initial stellar masses of the UCDs
and the IMF being either universal or changing systematically with metallicity and density according
to the Integrated Galactic IMF (IGIMF) theory. While the observed elevated $M/L_{\rm V}$ ratios
of the UCDs cannot be reproduced if the IMF is invariant and universal, the empirically derived IMF
which varies systematically with density and metallicity shows agreement with the observations.
Incorporating the UCD-mass-dependent retention fraction of dark remnants improves this agreement.
In addition we apply the results of N-body simulations to young UCDs and show that the same initial
conditions describing the observed $M/L_{\rm V}$ ratios reproduce the observed relation between
the half-mass radii and the present-day masses of the UCDs. The findings thus suggest that the majority
of UCDs that have elevated $M/L_{\rm V}$ ratios could have formed monolithically with significant
remnant-mass components that are centrally concentrated, while those with small $M/L_V$ values
may be merged star-cluster complexes.

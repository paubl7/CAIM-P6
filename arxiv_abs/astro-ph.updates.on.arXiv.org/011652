We present Hubble Space Telescope Cosmic Origin Spectrograph (COS) UV line spectroscopy and integral-field
unit observations of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in the Stephan's Quintet (SQ) galaxy group.
SQ hosts a 30 kpc long shocked ridge triggered by a galaxy collision at a relative velocity of 1000
km/s, where large amounts of cold (10-100 K) and warm (100-5000 K) molecular gas coexist with a hot
plasma. COS spectroscopy along five lines-of-sight, probing 1 kpc-diameter regions in the IGM,
reveals very broad (~2000 km/s) and powerful Ly$\alpha$ line emission with complex line shapes.
These Lyman-alpha line profiles are often similar to, or sometimes much broader than line profiles
obtained in H$\beta$, [CII], and CO (1-0) emission along the same lines-of-sight. In these cases,
the breadth of the Ly$\alpha$ emission, compared with H$\beta$, implies resonance scattering.
Line ratios of Ly$\alpha$/H$\beta$ for the two COS pointings closest to the center of the shocked
ridge are close to the Case B recombination value, suggesting that at these positions Ly$\alpha$
photons escape through scattering in a low density medium free of dust. Some Ly$\alpha$ spectra
show suppressed velocity components compared with [CII] and H$\beta$, implying that some of the
Ly$\alpha$ photons are absorbed. Scattering indicates that the neutral gas of the IGM is clumpy,
with multiple clumps along a given line of sight. Remarkably, over more than four orders of magnitude
in temperature, the powers radiated by the multi-phase IGM in X-rays, Ly$\alpha$, H$_2$, [CII]
are comparable within a factor of a few. We suggest that both shocks and mixing layers co-exist and
contribute to the energy dissipation associated with a turbulent energy cascade. This may be important
for the cooling of gas at higher redshifts, where the metal content is lower than in this local system,
and a high amplitude of turbulence more common.

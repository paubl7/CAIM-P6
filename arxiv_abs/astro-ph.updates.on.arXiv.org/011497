We present the cumulative star-formation histories (SFHs) of >15000 dwarf galaxies ($M_{*}=10^{7-10}M_{\odot}$)
from the TNG50 run of the IllustrisTNG suite across a vast range of environments. The key factors
determining the dwarfs' SFHs are their status as central or satellite and their stellar mass, with
centrals and more massive dwarfs assembling their stellar mass at later times on average compared
to satellites and lower mass dwarfs. The satellites (in hosts of total mass $M_{200c,\,host}=10^{12-14.3}M_{\odot}$)
assembled 90% of their z=0 stellar mass ~$7.0_{-5.5}^{+3.3}$ Gyr ago, while the centrals did so
only ~$1.0_{-0.5}^{+4.0}$ Gyr ago. TNG50 predicts a large diversity in SFHs for both centrals and
satellites, so that the stacked cumulative SFHs are representative of the TNG50 dwarf populations
only in an average sense and individual dwarfs can have significantly different cumulative SFHs.
Satellite dwarfs with the highest stellar mass to host mass ratios have the latest stellar mass assembly.
Satellites at fixed stellar and host halo mass, found closer to the cluster centre, or accreted at
earlier times, show significantly earlier stellar mass assembly. These trends, as well as the shapes
of the SFHs themselves, are a manifestation of the varying proportions within a given subsample
of quenched vs. star-forming galaxies, which exhibit markedly distinct SFH shapes. We also find
a subtle effect whereby satellite dwarfs in the most massive hosts at z=0 have higher SFRs at early
times, well before final infall into their z=0 host, compared to a control sample of centrals mass-matched
at the time of accretion. This suggests that the large-scale environment can have a mild effect even
on future satellites by providing the conditions for enhanced SF at early epochs. Our results are
useful theoretical predictions for comparison to future resolved-stellar-population observations.

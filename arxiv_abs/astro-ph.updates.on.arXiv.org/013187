Triple-star systems exhibit a phenomenon known as the Triple Evolution Dynamical Instability
(TEDI), in which mass loss in evolving triples triggers short-term dynamical instabilities, potentially
leading to collisions of stars, exchanges, and ejections. Previous work has shown that the TEDI
is an important pathway to head-on stellar collisions in the Galaxy, significantly exceeding the
rate of collisions due to random encounters in globular clusters. Here, we revisit the TEDI evolutionary
pathway using state-of-the-art population synthesis methods that self-consistently take into
account stellar evolution and binary interactions, as well as gravitational dynamics and perturbations
from passing stars in the field. We find Galactic TEDI-induced collision rates on the order of 1e-4/yr,
consistent with previous studies which were based on more simplified methods. The majority of TEDI-induced
collisions involve main sequence stars, potentially producing blue straggler stars. Collisions
are also possible involving more evolved stars, potentially producing eccentric post-common-envelope
systems, and white dwarfs collisions leading to Type Ia supernovae (although the latter with a negligible
contribution to the Galactic rate). In our simulations, the TEDI is not only triggered by adiabatic
wind mass loss, but also by Roche lobe overflow in the inner binary: when the donor star becomes less
massive than the accretor, the inner binary orbit widens, triggering triple dynamical instability.
We find that collision rates are increased by ~17% when fly-bys in the field are taken into account.
In addition to collisions, we find that the TEDI produces ~1e-4/yr of unbound stars, although none
with escape speeds in excess of 1e3 km/s.

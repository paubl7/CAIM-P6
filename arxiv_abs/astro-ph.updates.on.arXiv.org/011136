We investigate the chromospheric counterpart of small-scale coronal loops constituting a coronal
bright point (CBP) and its response to a photospheric magnetic-flux increase accompanied by co-temporal
CBP heating. We used co-observations from the AIA and HMI/SDO, together with data from the Fast Imaging
Solar Spectrograph taken in the Halpha and Ca II 8542 lines. We used a new multi-layer spectral inversion
technique to derive the temporal variations of the temperature of the Halpha loops (HLs). We find
that the counterpart of the CBP, as seen at chromospheric temperatures, is composed of a bundle of
dark elongated features named in this work Halpha loops, which constitute an integral part of the
CBP loop magnetic structure. An increase in the photospheric magnetic flux due to flux emergence
is accompanied by a rise of the coronal emission of the CBP loops, that is a heating episode. We also
observe enhanced chromospheric activity associated with the occurrence of new HLs and mottles.
While the coronal emission and magnetic flux increases appear to be co-temporal, the response of
the Halpha counterpart of the CBP occurs with a small delay of less than 3 min. A sharp temperature
increase is found in one of the HLs and in one of the CBP footpoints estimated at 46% and 55% with respect
to the pre-event values, also starting with a delay of less than 3~min following the coronal heating
episode. The low-lying CBP loop structure remains non-potential for the entire observing period.
The magnetic topological analysis of the overlying corona reveals the presence of a coronal null
point at the beginning and towards the end of the heating episode. The delay in the response of the
chromospheric counterpart of the CBP suggests that the heating may have occurred at coronal heights.

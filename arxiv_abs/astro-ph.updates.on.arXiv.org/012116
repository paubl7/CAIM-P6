The dark matter content of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy inferred from its kinematics is substantially
lower than expected from LCDM cosmological simulations. We use N-body simulations to examine whether
this may be the result of Galactic tides. We find that, despite improved proper motions from the Gaia
mission, the pericentric distance of Fornax remains poorly constrained, mainly because its largest
velocity component is roughly anti-parallel to the solar motion. Translating Fornax's proper
motion into a Galactocentric velocity is thus sensitively dependent on Fornax's assumed distance:
the observed distance uncertainty, $\pm 8\%$, implies pericentric distances that vary between
$r_{\rm peri}\sim 50$ and $r_{\rm peri}\sim 150$ kpc. Our simulations show that for $r_{\rm peri}$
in the lower range of that estimate, an LCDM subhalo with maximum circular velocity $V_{\rm max}=40$
km s$^{-1}$ (or virial mass $M_{200}\approx 10^{10} M_\odot$, as expected from LCDM) would be tidally
stripped to $V_{\rm max} \sim 23$ km s$^{-1}$ over $10$ Gyr. This would reduce the dark mass within
the Fornax stellar half-mass radius to about half its initial value, bringing it into agreement
with observations. Tidal stripping affects mainly Fornax's dark matter halo; its stellar component
is affected little, losing less than $5\%$ of its initial mass in the process. We also explore the
effect of Galactic tides on the dynamical friction decay times of Fornax's population of globular
clusters (GC) and find little evidence for substantial changes, compared with models run in isolation.
A population of GCs with initial orbital radii between $1$ and $2$ kpc is consistent with the present-day
spatial distribution of Fornax GCs, despite assuming a cuspy halo. Both the dark matter content
and the GC population of Fornax seem consistent with current models of dwarf galaxy formation in
LCDM.

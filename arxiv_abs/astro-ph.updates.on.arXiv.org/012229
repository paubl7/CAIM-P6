Stars form by accreting material from their surrounding disks. There is a consensus that matter
flowing through the disk is channelled onto the stellar surface by the stellar magnetic field. This
is thought to be strong enough to truncate the disk close to the so-called corotation radius where
the disk rotates at the same rate as the star. Spectro-interferometric studies in young stellar
objects show that Hydrogen is mostly emitted in a region of a few milliarcseconds across, usually
located within the dust sublimation radius. Its origin is still a matter of debate and it can be interpreted
as coming from the stellar magnetosphere, a rotating wind or a disk. In the case of intermediate-mass
Herbig AeBe stars, the fact that the Br gamma emission is spatially resolved rules out that most of
the emission comes from the magnetosphere. This is due to the weak magnetic fields (some tenths of
G) detected in these sources, resulting in very compact magnetospheres. In the case of T Tauri sources,
their larger magnetospheres should make them easier to resolve. However, the small angular size
of the magnetosphere (a few tenths of milliarcseconds), along with the presence of winds emitting
in Hydrogen make the observations interpretation challenging. Here, we present direct evidence
of magnetospheric accretion by spatially resolving the inner disk of the 60 pc T Tauri star TW Hydrae
through optical long baseline interferometry. We find that the hydrogen near-infrared emission
comes from a region approximately 3.5 stellar radii (R*) across. This region is within the continuum
dusty disk emitting region (Rcont = 7 R*) and smaller than the corotation radius which is twice as
big. This indicates that the hydrogen emission originates at the accretion columns, as expected
in magnetospheric accretion models, rather than in a wind emitted at much larger distance (>1au).

We perform the first simultaneous Bayesian parameter inference and optimal reconstruction of
the gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave background (CMB), using 100 deg$^2$ of polarization
observations from the SPTpol receiver on the South Pole Telescope. These data reach noise levels
as low as 5.8 $\mu$K-arcmin in polarization, which are low enough that the typically used quadratic
estimator (QE) technique for analyzing CMB lensing is significantly sub-optimal. Conversely,
the Bayesian procedure extracts all lensing information from the data and is optimal at any noise
level. We infer the amplitude of the gravitational lensing potential to be $A_\phi\,{=}\,0.949\,{\pm}\,0.122$
using the Bayesian pipeline, consistent with our QE pipeline result, but with 17\% smaller error
bars. The Bayesian analysis also provides a simple way to account for systematic uncertainties,
performing a similar job as frequentist "bias hardening," and reducing the systematic uncertainty
on $A_\phi$ due to polarization calibration from almost half of the statistical error to effectively
zero. Finally, we jointly constrain $A_\phi$ along with $A_{\rm L}$, the amplitude of lensing-like
effects on the CMB power spectra, demonstrating that the Bayesian method can be used to easily infer
parameters both from an optimal lensing reconstruction and from the delensed CMB, while exactly
accounting for the correlation between the two. These results demonstrate the feasibility of the
Bayesian approach on real data, and pave the way for future analysis of deep CMB polarization measurements
with SPT-3G, Simons Observatory, and CMB-S4, where improvements relative to the QE can reach 1.5
times tighter constraints on $A_\phi$ and 7 times lower effective lensing reconstruction noise.

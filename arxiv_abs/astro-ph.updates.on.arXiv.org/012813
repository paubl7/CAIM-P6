Many observed disc galaxies harbour a central bar. In the standard cosmological paradigm, galactic
bars should be slowed down by dynamical friction from the dark matter halo. This friction depends
on the galaxy's physical properties in a complex way, making it impossible to formulate analytically.
Fortunately, cosmological hydrodynamical simulations provide an excellent statistical population
of galaxies, letting us quantify how simulated galactic bars evolve within dark haloes. We measure
bar lengths and pattern speeds in barred galaxies in state-of-the-art cosmological hydrodynamical
simulations of the IllustrisTNG and EAGLE projects, using techniques similar to those used observationally.
We then compare our results with the largest available observational sample at $z=0$. We show that
the tension between these simulations and observations in the ratio of corotation radius to bar
length is $12.62\sigma$ (TNG50), $13.56\sigma$ (TNG100), $2.94\sigma$ (EAGLE50), and $9.69\sigma$
(EAGLE100), revealing for the first time that the significant tension reported previously persists
in the recently released TNG50. The slightly lower statistical tension in EAGLE50 is actually caused
by it only having 5 galaxies suitable for our analysis, but all four simulations give similar statistics
for the bar pattern speed distribution. In addition, the fraction of disc galaxies with bars is similar
between TNG50 and TNG100, though somewhat above EAGLE100. The simulated bar fraction and its trend
with stellar mass both differ greatly from observations. These dramatic disagreements cast serious
doubt on the efficiency of dynamical friction acting on real-world galactic bars, and therefore
also on the actual presence of cold dark matter particles on these scales.

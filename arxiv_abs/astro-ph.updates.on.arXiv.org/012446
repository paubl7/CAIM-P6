The Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), a $\sim$200 pc sized region around the Galactic Centre, is peculiar
in that it shows a star formation rate (SFR) that is suppressed with respect to the available dense
gas. To study the SFR in the CMZ, young stellar objects (YSOs) can be investigated. Here we present
radio observations of 334 2.2 $\mu$m infrared sources that have been identified as YSO candidates.
Our goal is to investigate the presence of centimetre wavelength radio continuum counterparts
to this sample of YSO candidates which we use to constrain the current SFR in the CMZ. As part of the
GLOSTAR survey, D-configuration VLA data was obtained for the Galactic Centre, covering -2$^{\circ}<l<$2$^{\circ}$
and -1$^{\circ}<b<$1$^{\circ}$, with a frequency coverage of 4-8 GHz. We matched YSOs with radio
continuum sources based on selection criteria and classified these radio sources as potential
HII regions and determined their physical properties. Of the 334 YSO candidates, we found 35 with
radio continuum counterparts. We find that 94 YSOs are associated with dense dust condensations
identified in the 870 $\mu$m ATLASGAL survey, of which 14 have a GLOSTAR counterpart. Of the 35 YSOs
with radio counterparts, 11 are confirmed as HII regions, based on their spectral indices and the
literature. We estimated their Lyman continuum photon flux in order to estimate the mass of the ionising
star. Combining these with known sources, the present-day SFR in the CMZ is calculated to be $\sim$0.068
M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is $\sim$6.8$\%$ of the Galactic SFR. Candidate YSOs that lack radio
counterparts may not have yet evolved to the stage of exhibiting an HII region or, conversely, are
older and have dispersed their natal clouds. Since many lack dust emission, the latter is more likely.
Our SFR estimate in the CMZ is in agreement with previous estimates in the literature.

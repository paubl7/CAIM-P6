We present the first 850 $\mu$m polarization observations in the most active star-forming site
of the Rosette Molecular Cloud (RMC, $d\sim$1.6 kpc) in the wall of the Rosette Nebula, imaged with
the SCUBA-2/POL-2 instruments of the JCMT, as part of the B-Fields In Star-Forming Region Observations
2 (BISTRO-2) survey. From the POL-2 data we find that the polarization fraction decreases with the
850 $\mu$m continuum intensity with $\alpha$ = 0.49 $\pm$ 0.08 in the $p \propto I^{\rm -\alpha}$
relation, which suggests that some fraction of the dust grains remain aligned at high densities.
The north of our 850 $\mu$m image reveals a "gemstone ring" morphology, which is a $\sim$1 pc-diameter
ring-like structure with extended emission in the "head" to the south-west. We hypothesize that
it might have been blown by feedback in its interior, while the B-field is parallel to its circumference
in most places. In the south of our SCUBA-2 field the clumps are apparently connected with filaments
which follow Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs). Here, the POL-2 magnetic field orientations appear
bimodal with respect to the large-scale Planck field. The mass of our effective mapped area is $\sim$
174 $M_\odot$ that we calculate from 850 $\mu$m flux densities. We compare our results with masses
from large-scale emission-subtracted Herschel 250 $\mu$m data, and find agreement within 30%.
We estimate the POS B-field strength in one typical subregion using the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi
(DCF) technique and find 80 $\pm$ 30 $\mu$G toward a clump and its outskirts. The estimated mass-to-flux
ratio of $\lambda$ = 2.3 $\pm$ 1.0 suggests that the B-field is not sufficiently strong to prevent
gravitational collapse in this subregion.

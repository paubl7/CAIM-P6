A synthetic spectrum-fitting analysis was applied to the Ca II line at 3933.68 A for 122 A-type stars
(7000 <Te < 10000 K) in a wide range of rotational velocity (10 < vsini < 300 km/s), in order to study
the behaviors of Ca abundances ([Ca/H]39) determined from this Ca II 3934 line, especially in context
of (i) how they are related with the Am phenomenon (often seen in slow rotators) and (ii) whether they
are consistent with the Ca abundances ([Ca/H]61) derived from the weaker Ca I 6162 line. It was confirmed
that Ca line strengths in Am stars tend to be weaker and associated abundances are lower compared
to non-Am stars at the same Te, indicating a deficiency of Ca in the photosphere of Am stars. However,
an appreciable fraction of cool Am stars (Te < 8000 K) were found to show anomalous Ca II 3934 line feature
(i.e., unusually broad for its weakness) which is hard to explain. Regarding the comparison between
[Ca/H]39 and [Ca/H]61, while both are roughly consistent for hotter stars (Te > 8000 K), the former
tends to be lower (by up to -1 dex or even more) than the latter for cooler A stars (Te < 8000 K) including
those "weak broad K line" objects, This fact suggests that some special mechanism reducing the strength
of Ca II 3934 line is involved at Te < 8000 K where [Ca/H]39 would be no more reliable. Whereas atomic
diffusion causing the deficit of Ca in the photosphere as a result of element segregation in the deeper
radiative envelope may be regarded as a promising explanation because it seems to fit in the qualitative
trend of [Ca/H]61 in A-type stars, the well-known feature of considerably weak Ca II K line in classical
Am stars should not necessarily be attributed to only this element diffusion scenario, for which
some unknown weakening mechanism specific to this resonance line may independently be operative.

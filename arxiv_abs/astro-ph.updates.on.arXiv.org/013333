We present a census of neutral gas in the Milky Way disk and halo down to limiting column densities
of $N$(HI)$\sim10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ using measurements of HI Lyman-series absorption from the
Far Ultraviolet Spectroscopic Explorer (FUSE). Our results are drawn from an analysis of 25 AGN
sightlines spread evenly across the sky with Galactic latitude |b|$\gtrsim 20^{\circ}$. By simultaneously
fitting multi-component Voigt profiles to 11 Lyman-series absorption transitions covered by
FUSE (Ly$\beta$-Ly$\mu$) plus HST measurements of Ly$\alpha$, we derive the kinematics and column
densities of a sample of 152 HI absorption components. While saturation prevents accurate measurements
of many components with column densities 17$\lesssim$log$N$(HI)$\lesssim$19, we derive robust
measurements at log$N$(HI)$\lesssim$17 and log$N$(HI)$\gtrsim$19. We derive the first ultraviolet
HI column density distribution function (CDDF) of the Milky Way, both globally and for low-velocity
(ISM), intermediate-velocity clouds (IVCs), and high-velocity clouds (HVCs). We find that IVCs
and HVCs show statistically indistinguishable CDDF slopes, with $\beta_{\rm IVC}=$ $-1.01_{-0.14}^{+0.15}$
and $\beta_{\rm HVC}=$ $-1.05_{-0.06}^{+0.07}$. Overall, the CDDF of the Galactic disk and halo
appears shallower than that found by comparable extragalactic surveys, suggesting a relative
abundance of high-column density gas in the Galactic halo. We derive the sky covering fractions
as a function of HI column density, finding an enhancement of IVC gas in the northern hemisphere compared
to the south. We also find evidence for an excess of inflowing HI over outflowing HI, with $-$0.88$\pm$0.40
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ of HVC inflow versus 0.20$\pm$0.10 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ of HVC outflow, confirming
an excess of inflowing HVCs seen in UV metal lines.

Obtaining observational constraints on the role of turbulent effects for the solar dynamo is a difficult,
yet crucial, task. Without such knowledge, the full picture of the operation mechanism of the solar
dynamo cannot be formed. The magnetic helicity spectrum provides important information about
the $\alpha$ effect. Here we demonstrate a formalism in spherical geometry to infer magnetic helicity
spectra directly from observations of the magnetic field, taking into account the sign change of
magnetic helicity across the Sun's equator. Using an angular correlation function of the magnetic
field, we develop a method to infer spectra for magnetic energy and helicity. The retrieval of the
latter relies on a fundamental definition of helicity in terms of linkage of magnetic flux. We apply
the two-scale approach, previously used in Cartesian geometry, to spherical geometry for systems
where a sign reversal of helicity is expected across the equator at both small and large scales. We
test the method by applying it to an analytical model of a fully helical field, and to magneto-hydrodynamic
simulations of a turbulent dynamo. The helicity spectra computed from the vector potential available
in the models are in excellent agreement to the spectra computed solely from the magnetic field using
our method. In a next test, we use our method to obtain the helicity spectrum from a synoptic magnetic
field map corresponding to a Carrington rotation. We observe clear signs of a bihelical spectrum
of magnetic helicity. Our formalism makes it possible to infer magnetic helicity in spherical geometry,
without the necessity of computing the magnetic vector potential. This has the advantage of being
gauge invariant. It has many applications in solar and stellar observations, but can also be used
to analyze global magnetoconvection models of stars and compare them with observations.

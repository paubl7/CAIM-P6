We report a characterization of the multi-band flux variability and correlations of the nearby
(z=0.031) blazar Markarian 421 (Mrk 421) using data from Mets\"{a}hovi, Swift, Fermi-LAT, MAGIC,
FACT and other collaborations and instruments from November 2014 till June 2016. Mrk 421 did not
show any prominent flaring activity, but exhibited periods of historically low activity above
1 TeV (F$_{>1\mathrm{TeV}}<$ 1.7$\times$10$^{-12}$ ph cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$) and in the 2-10 keV
(X-ray) band (F$_{2-10 \mathrm{keV}}<$3.6$\times$10$^{-11}$ erg cm$^{-2}$ s$^{-1}$), during
which the Swift-BAT data suggests an additional spectral component beyond the regular synchrotron
emission. The highest flux variability occurs in X-rays and very-high-energy (E$>$0.1 TeV) $\gamma$-rays,
which, despite the low activity, show a significant positive correlation with no time lag. The HR$_\mathrm{keV}$
and HR$_\mathrm{TeV}$ show the harder-when-brighter trend observed in many blazars, but the trend
flattens at the highest fluxes, which suggests a change in the processes dominating the blazar variability.
Enlarging our data set with data from years 2007 to 2014, we measured a positive correlation between
the optical and the GeV emission over a range of about 60 days centered at time lag zero, and a positive
correlation between the optical/GeV and the radio emission over a range of about 60 days centered
at a time lag of $43^{+9}_{-6}$ days.This observation is consistent with the radio-bright zone
being located about 0.2 parsec downstream from the optical/GeV emission regions of the jet. The
flux distributions are better described with a LogNormal function in most of the energy bands probed,
indicating that the variability in Mrk 421 is likely produced by a multiplicative process.

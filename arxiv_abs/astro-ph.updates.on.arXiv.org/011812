Glitches are sudden increases in the rotation rate $\nu$ of neutron stars, which are thought to be
driven by the neutron superfluid inside the star. The Vela pulsar presents a comparatively high
rate of glitches, with 21 events reported since observations began in 1968. These are amongst the
largest known glitches (17 of them have sizes $\Delta\nu/\nu\geq10^{-6}$) and exhibit very similar
characteristics. This similarity, combined with the regularity with which large glitches occur,
has turned Vela into an archetype of this type of glitching behaviour. The properties of its smallest
glitches, on the other hand, are not clearly established. High-cadence observations of the Vela
pulsar were taken between 1981 and 2005 at the Mount Pleasant Radio Observatory. An automated systematic
search was carried out that investigated whether a significant change of spin frequency $\nu$ and/or
the spin-down rate $\dot{\nu}$ takes place at any given time. We find two new glitches, with respective
sizes $\Delta\nu/\nu$ of $(5.55\pm0.03)\times10^{-9}$ and $(38\pm4)\times10^{-9}$. In addition
to these two glitch events, our study reveals numerous events of all possible signatures (i.e. combinations
of $\Delta\nu$ and $\Delta\dot{\nu}$ signs), all of them small with $|\Delta\nu|/\nu<10^{-9}$,
which contribute to the Vela timing noise. The Vela pulsar presents an under-abundance of small
glitches compared to many other glitching pulsars, which appears genuine and not a result of observational
biases. In addition to typical glitches, the smooth spin-down of the pulsar is also affected by an
almost continuous activity that can be partially characterised by small step-like changes in $\nu$,
$\dot{\nu,}$ or both. Simulations indicate that a continuous wandering of the rotational phase,
following a red spectrum, could mimic such step-like changes in the timing residuals.

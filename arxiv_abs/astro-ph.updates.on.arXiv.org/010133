The long-term evolution of the Sun's rotation period cannot be directly observed, and is instead
inferred from trends in the measured rotation periods of other Sun-like stars. Assuming the Sun
spins-down as it ages, following rotation rate $\propto$ age$^{-1/2}$, requires the current solar
angular momentum-loss rate to be around $6\times 10^{30}$erg. Magnetohydrodynamic models, and
previous observations of the solar wind (from the Helios and Wind spacecraft), generally predict
a values closer to $1\times 10^{30}$erg or $3\times 10^{30}$erg, respectively. Recently, the
Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed tangential solar wind speeds as high as $\sim50$km/s in a localized
region of the inner heliosphere. If such rotational flows were prevalent throughout the corona,
it would imply that the solar wind angular momentum-loss rate is an order of magnitude larger than
all of those previous estimations. In this letter, we evaluate the angular momentum flux in the solar
wind, using data from the first two orbits of PSP. The solar wind is observed to contain both large
positive (as seen during perihelion), and negative angular momentum fluxes. We analyse two solar
wind streams that were repeatedly traversed by PSP; the first is a slow wind stream whose average
angular momentum flux fluctuates between positive to negative, and the second is an intermediate
speed stream containing a positive angular momentum flux (more consistent with a constant flow
of angular momentum). When the data from PSP is evaluated holistically, the average equatorial
angular momentum flux implies a global angular momentum-loss rate of around $2.6-4.2\times 10^{30}$
erg (which is more consistent with observations from previous spacecraft).

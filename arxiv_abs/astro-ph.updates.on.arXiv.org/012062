We present simulations of the multi-phase interstellar medium (ISM) at solar neighbourhood conditions
including thermal and non-thermal ISM processes, star cluster formation, and feedback from massive
stars: stellar winds, hydrogen ionising radiation computed with the novel TreeRay radiative transfer
method, supernovae (SN), and the injection of cosmic rays (CR). N-body dynamics is computed with
a 4th-order Hermite integrator. We systematically investigate the impact of stellar feedback
on the self-gravitating ISM with magnetic fields, CR advection and diffusion and non-equilibrium
chemical evolution. SN-only feedback results in strongly clustered star formation with very high
star cluster masses, a bi-modal distribution of the ambient SN densities, and low volume-filling
factors (VFF) of warm gas, typically inconsistent with local conditions. Early radiative feedback
prevents an initial starburst, reduces star cluster masses and outflow rates. Furthermore, star
formation rate surface densities of $\Sigma_{\dot{M}_\star} = 1.4-5.9 \times 10^{-3}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$,
VFF$_\mathrm{warm} = 60-80$ per cent as well as thermal, kinetic, magnetic, and cosmic ray energy
densities of the model including all feedback mechanisms agree well with observational constraints.
On the short, 100 Myr, timescales investigated here, CRs only have a moderate impact on star formation
and the multi-phase gas structure and result in cooler outflows, if present. Our models indicate
that at low gas surface densities SN-only feedback only captures some characteristics of the star-forming
ISM and outflows/inflows relevant for regulating star formation. Instead, star formation is regulated
on star cluster scales by radiation and winds from massive stars in clusters, whose peak masses agree
with solar neighbourhood estimates.

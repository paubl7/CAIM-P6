Combining stellar atmospheric parameters, such as effective temperature, surface gravity, and
metallicity, with barycentric radial velocity data provides insight into the chemo-dynamics
of the Milky Way and our local Galactic environment. We analyze 3075 stars with spectroscopic data
from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III) MARVELS radial velocity survey and present atmospheric
parameters for 2343 dwarf stars using the spectral indices method, a modified version of the equivalent
width method. We present barycentric radial velocities for a sample of 2610 stars with a median uncertainty
of 0.3 km s$^{-1}$. We determine stellar ages using two independent methods and calculate ages for
2335 stars with a maximum-likelihood isochronal age-dating method and for 2194 stars with a Bayesian
age-dating method. Using previously published parallax data we compute Galactic orbits and space
velocities for 2504 stars to explore stellar populations based on kinematic and age parameters.
This study combines good ages and exquisite velocities to explore local chemo-kinematics of the
Milky Way, which complements many of the recent studies of giant stars with the APOGEE survey, and
we find our results to be in agreement with current chemo-dynamical models of the Milky Way. Particularly,
we find from our metallicity distributions and velocity-age relations of a kinematically-defined
thin disk that the metal rich end has stars of all ages, even after we clean the sample of highly eccentric
stars, suggesting that radial migration plays a key role in the metallicity scatter of the thin disk.
All stellar parameters and kinematic data derived in this work are catalogued and published online
in machine-readable form.

We present constraints on extensions to the flat $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model by varying the
spatial curvature $\Omega_K$, the sum of the neutrino masses $\sum m_\nu$, the dark energy equation
of state parameter $w$, and the Hu-Sawicki $f(R)$ gravity $f_{R0}$ parameter. With the combined
$3\times2$pt measurements of cosmic shear from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS-1000), galaxy clustering
from the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS), and galaxy-galaxy lensing from the overlap
between KiDS-1000, BOSS, and the spectroscopic 2-degree Field Lensing Survey (2dFLenS), we find
results that are fully consistent with a flat $\Lambda$CDM model with $\Omega_K=0.011^{+0.054}_{-0.057}$,
$\sum m_\nu<1.76$ eV (95% CL), and $w=-0.99^{+0.11}_{-0.13}$. The $f_{R0}$ parameter is unconstrained
in our fully non-linear $f(R)$ cosmic shear analysis. Considering three different model selection
criteria, we find no clear preference for either the fiducial flat $\Lambda$CDM model or any of the
considered extensions. Besides extensions to the flat $\Lambda$CDM parameter space, we also explore
restrictions to common subsets of the flat $\Lambda$CDM parameter space by fixing the amplitude
of the primordial power spectrum to the Planck best-fit value, as well as adding external data from
supernovae and lensing of the CMB. Neither the beyond-$\Lambda$CDM models nor the imposed restrictions
explored in this analysis are able to resolve the $\sim 3\sigma$ tension in $S_8$ between the $3\times2$pt
constraints and Planck, with the exception of $w$CDM, where the $S_8$ tension is resolved. The tension
in the $w$CDM case persists, however, when considering the joint $S_8$-$w$ parameter space. The
joint flat $\Lambda$CDM CMB lensing and $3\times2$pt analysis is found to yield tight constraints
on $\Omega_{\rm m}=0.307^{+0.008}_{-0.013}$, $\sigma_8=0.769^{+0.022}_{-0.010}$, and $S_8=0.779^{+0.013}_{-0.013}$.

Messier 8 (M8), one of the brightest HII regions in our Galaxy, is associated with two prominent massive
star-forming regions: M8-Main, the particularly bright part of the large scale HII region (mainly)
ionised by the stellar system Herschel 36 (Her 36) and M8 East (M8 E), which is mainly powered by a deeply
embedded young stellar object (YSO), a bright infrared (IR) source, M8E-IR. We aim to study the interaction
of the massive star-forming region M8 E with its surroundings and to compare the star-forming environments
of M8-Main and M8 E. We used the IRAM 30 m telescope to perform an imaging spectroscopy survey of the
molecular environment of M8E-IR. We imaged and analysed data for the $J$ = 1 $\to$ 0 rotational transitions
of $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO, N$_2$H$^+$, HCN, H$^{13}$CN, HCO$^+$, H$^{13}$CO$^+$, HNC and HN$^{13}$C
observed for the first time toward M8~E. We used LTE and non-LTE techniques to determine column densities
of the observed species and to constrain the physical conditions of the gas responsible for their
emission. Examining the YSO population in M8~E allows us to explore the observed ionization front
(IF) as seen in GLIMPSE 8~$\mu$m emission image. We find that $^{12}$CO probes the warm diffuse gas
also traced by the GLIMPSE 8~$\mu$m emission, while N$_2$H$^+$ and HN$^{13}$C trace the cool and
dense gas. We find that the star-formation in M8~E appears to be triggered by the earlier formed stellar
cluster NGC~6530, which powers an HII region giving rise to an IF that is moving at a speed $\geq$ 0.26~km~s$^{-1}$
across M8~E. We derive temperatures of 80 K and 30 K for the warm and cool gas components, respectively,
and constrain H$_2$ volume densities to be in the range of 10$^4$--10$^6$~cm$^{-3}$. Comparison
of the observed abundances of various species reflects the fact that M8~E is at an earlier stage of
massive star formation than M8-Main.

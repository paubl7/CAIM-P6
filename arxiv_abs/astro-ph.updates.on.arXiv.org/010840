Context. The characterisation of exoplanet atmospheres has shown a wide diversity in compositions.
Hot Jupiters have the appropriate temperatures to host metallic compounds, which should be detectable
through transmission spectroscopy. Aims. We aim to detect exotic species in transmission spectra
of hot Jupiters, specifically WASP-31b, by trying a variety of chemical species to explain the spectrum.
Methods. A reanalysis of publicly available transmission data of WASP-31b has been conducted,
using the Bayesian retrieval framework TauREx II. Various combinations of the opacities of 25 species
are retrieved, to determine the minimum set that is needed to fit the observed spectrum. Results.
We report evidence for the spectroscopic signatures of CrH, H2O and K in WASP-31b. Compared to a flat
model without any signatures, a CrH-only model is preferred with a statistical significance of
~3.9 sigma. A model consisting of both CrH+H2O is found with ~2.6 sigma and ~3 sigma confidence over
a CrH-only and H2O-only model respectively. Furthermore, weak evidence for the addition of K is
found at ~2.2 sigma over the H2O+CrH model, although the fidelity of the data point associated with
this signature was questioned in earlier studies. Finally, the inclusion of CIA and a Rayleigh scattering
slope is found with ~3.5 sigma confidence over the flat model. This analysis presents the first evidence
for the signatures of CrH in a hot Jupiter atmosphere. At a retrieved temperature of 1481 K, the atmosphere
of WASP-31b is hot enough to host gaseous Cr-bearing species. The retrieved abundances agree well
with predictions from thermal equilibrium chemistry and with the CrH abundance found in an L-type
brown dwarf atmosphere. However, additional retrievals using VLT FORS2 data lead to a non-detection
of CrH. JWST and ARIEL have the potential to confirm the detection and discover other CrH features.

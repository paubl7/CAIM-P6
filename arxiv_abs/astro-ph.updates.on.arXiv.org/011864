Context. ALMA observations at 1.4 mm and 0.2'' (750au) angular resolution of the Main core in the
high-mass star forming region G31.41+0.31 have revealed a puzzling scenario: on the one hand, the
continuum emission looks very homogeneous and the core appears to undergo solid-body rotation,
suggesting a monolithic core stabilized by the magnetic field; on the other hand, rotation and infall
speed up toward the core center, where two massive embedded free-free continuum sources have been
detected, pointing to an unstable core having undergone fragmentation. Aims. To establish whether
the Main core is indeed monolithic or its homogeneous appearance is due to a combination of large
dust opacity and low angular resolution, we carried out millimeter observations at higher angular
resolution and different wavelengths. Methods. We carried out ALMA observations at 1.4 mm and 3.5
mm that achieved angular resolutions of 0.1''(375 au) and 0.075'' (280 au), respectively. VLA observations
at 7 mm and 1.3 cm at even higher angular resolution, 0.05'' (190 au) and 0.07'' (260 au), respectively,
were also carried out to better study the nature of the free-free continuum sources detected in the
core. Results. The millimeter continuum emission of the Main core has been clearly resolved into
at least four sources, A, B, C, and D, within 1'', indicating that the core is not monolithic. The deconvolved
radii of the dust emission of the sources, estimated at 3.5 mm, are 400-500au, their masses range
from 15 to 26 Msun, and their number densities are several 1E9 cm-3. Sources A and B, located closer
to the center of the core and separated by 750 au, are clearly associated with two free-free continuum
sources, likely thermal radio jets, and are the brightest in the core. The spectral energy distribution
of these two sources and their masses and sizes are similar and suggest a common origin.

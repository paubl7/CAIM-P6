Most stars are formed as star clusters in galaxies, which then disperse into galactic disks. Upcoming
exascale supercomputational facilities will enable performing simulations of galaxies and their
formation by resolving individual stars (star-by-star simulations). This will substantially
advance our understanding of star formation in galaxies, star cluster formation, and assembly
histories of galaxies. In previous galaxy simulations, a simple stellar population approximation
was used. It is, however, difficult to improve the mass resolution with this approximation. Therefore,
a model for forming individual stars that can be used in simulations of galaxies must be established.
In this first paper of a series of the SIRIUS (SImulations Resolving IndividUal Stars) project,
we demonstrate a stochastic star formation model for star-by-star simulations. An assumed stellar
initial mass function (IMF) is randomly assigned to newly formed stars. We introduce a maximum search
radius to assemble the mass from surrounding gas particles to form star particles. In this study,
we perform a series of N-body/smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations of star cluster formations
from turbulent molecular clouds and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies as test cases. The IMF can be correctly
sampled if a maximum search radius that is larger than the value estimated from the threshold density
for star formation is adopted. In small clouds, the formation of massive stars is highly stochastic
because of the small number of stars. We confirm that the star formation efficiency and threshold
density do not strongly affect the results. We find that our model can naturally reproduce the relationship
between the most massive stars and the total stellar mass of star clusters. Herein, we demonstrate
that our models can be applied to simulations varying from star clusters to galaxies for a wide range
of resolutions.

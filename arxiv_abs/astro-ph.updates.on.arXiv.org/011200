We describe the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Deep Fields, a set of images and associated multi-wavelength
catalogue ($ugrizJHKs$) built from Dark Energy Camera (DECam) and Visible and Infrared Survey
Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA) data. The DES Deep Fields comprise 11 fields (10 DES supernova fields
plus COSMOS), with a total area of $\sim30~$ square degrees in $ugriz$ bands and reaching a maximum
$i$-band depth of 26.75 (AB, $10\sigma$, 2"). We present a catalogue for the DES 3-year cosmology
analysis of those four fields with full 8-band coverage, totalling $5.88~$ sq. deg. after masking.
The catalogue is constructed in order to provide a sample of effectively noiseless galaxies (S/N
$>\sqrt{10}\times$ their equivalents in the main DES survey), to be used as a prior on the population
of objects observed in the DES and their moments in light distribution, a source of high-quality
redshift information in constructing source galaxy redshift distributions for weak lensing analyses,
and a host of deep extragalactic science. Numbering $2.8~$million objects ($1.6~$million post
masking), our catalogue is drawn from images coadded to consistent depths of $r=25.7, i=25, z=24.3$
mag. We use a new model-fitting code, built upon established methods, to deblend sources and ensure
consistent colours across the $u$-band to $Ks$-band wavelength range. We further detail the tight
control we maintain over the point-spread function modelling required for the model fitting, astrometry
and consistency of photometry between the four fields. The catalogue allows us to perform a careful
star-galaxy separation and produces excellent photometric redshift performance (${\rm NMAD}
= 0.023$ at $i<23$). The Deep-Fields catalogue will be made available as part of the cosmology data
products release, following the completion of the DES 3-year weak lensing and galaxy clustering
cosmology work.

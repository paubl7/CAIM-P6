Modeling the optical point spread function (PSF) is particularly challenging for adaptive optics
(AO)-assisted observations owing to the its complex shape and spatial variations. We aim to (i)
exhaustively demonstrate the accuracy of a recent analytical model from comparison with a large
sample of imaged PSFs, (ii) assess the conditions for which the model is optimal, and (iii) unleash
the strength of this framework to enable the joint estimation of atmospheric parameters, AO performance
and static aberrations. We gathered 4812 on-sky PSFs obtained from seven AO systems and used the
same fitting algorithm to test the model on various AO PSFs and diagnose AO performance from the model
outputs. Finally, we highlight how this framework enables the characterization of the so-called
low wind effect on the SPHERE instrument and piston cophasing errors on the Keck II telescope. Over
4812 PSFs, the model reaches down to 4% of error on both the Strehl-ratio (SR) and full width at half
maximum (FWHM). We particularly illustrate that the estimation of the Fried parameter, which is
one of the model parameters, is consistent with known seeing statistics and follows expected trends
in wavelength using the MUSE instrument ($\lambda^{6/5}$) and field (no variations) from GSAOI
images with a standard deviation of 0.4cm. Finally, we show that we can retrieve a combination of
differential piston, tip, and tilt modes introduced by the LWE that compares to ZELDA measurements,
as well as segment piston errors from the Keck II telescope and particularly the stair mode that has
already been revealed from previous studies. This model matches all types of AO PSFs at the level
of 4% error and can be used for AO diagnosis, post-processing, and wavefront sensing purposes.

The surfaces of many planetary bodies, including asteroids and small moons, are covered with dust
to pebble-sized grains held weakly to the surface by gravity and contact forces. The Hayabusa2 and
OSIRIS-REx missions have both confirmed that this is the case for the asteroids (162173) Ryugu and
(101955) Bennu, respectively, raising the question of how surface disturbances propagate in low-gravity
environments. Instruments including sensors and anchoring mechanisms for use on such surfaces
will require efficient and effective design principles. We analyze the behavior of a flexible probe
inserted into loose regolith as a function of speed and gravitational acceleration as a prototypical
example exploring the relevant dynamics. The EMPANADA experiment (Ejecta-Minimizing Protocols
for Applications Needing Anchoring or Digging on Asteroids) flew on several parabolic flights.
It employs a classic granular physics technique, photoelasticity, to quantify the dynamics of
a flexible probe during its insertion into a laboratory system of bi-disperse, cm-sized model grains.
We identify the grain-scale forces throughout the system for probe insertion at a variety of speeds
and for four different levels of gravity: terrestrial, martian, lunar, and microgravity. We demonstrate
that the photoelastic techniques provide results that complement traditional load cell measurements,
with both methods identifying discrete, stick-slip failure events that increase in both magnitude
and frequency as a function of the gravitational acceleration. For microgravity experiments,
stick-slip behaviors are negligible. We additionally find that faster probe insertion can suppress
stick-slip behaviors where they are present. We conclude that the behavior of regolith on rubble
pile asteroids is likely quite distinct from the environments found on larger objects.

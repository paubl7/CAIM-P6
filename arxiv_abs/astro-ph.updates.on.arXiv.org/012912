From Swift monitoring of a sample of active galactic nuclei (AGN) we found a transient X-ray obscuration
event in Seyfert-1 galaxy NGC 3227, and thus triggered our joint XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and Hubble
Space Telescope (HST) observations to study this event. Here in the first paper of our series we present
the broadband continuum modelling of the spectral energy distribution (SED) for NGC 3227, extending
from near infrared (NIR) to hard X-rays. We use our new spectra taken with XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and
HST/COS in 2019, together with archival unobscured XMM-Newton, NuSTAR, and HST/STIS data, in order
to disentangle various spectral components of NGC 3227 and recover the underlying continuum. We
find the observed NIR-optical-UV continuum is explained well by an accretion disk blackbody component
(Tmax = 10 eV), which is internally reddened by E(B-V) = 0.45 with a Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) extinction
law. We derive the inner radius (12 Rg) and the accretion rate (0.1 solar mass per year) of the disk
by modelling the thermal disk emission. The internal reddening in NGC 3227 is most likely associated
with outflows from the dusty AGN torus. In addition, an unreddened continuum component is also evident,
which likely arises from scattered radiation, associated with the extended narrow-line region
(NLR) of NGC 3227. The extreme ultraviolet (EUV) continuum, and the 'soft X-ray excess', can be explained
with a 'warm Comptonisation' component. The hard X-rays are consistent with a power-law and a neutral
reflection component. The intrinsic bolometric luminosity of the AGN in NGC 3227 is about 2.2e+43
erg/s in 2019, corresponding to 3% Eddington luminosity. Our continuum modelling of the new triggered
data of NGC 3227 requires the presence of a new obscuring gas with column density NH = 5e+22 cm^-2,
partially covering the X-ray source (Cf = 0.6).

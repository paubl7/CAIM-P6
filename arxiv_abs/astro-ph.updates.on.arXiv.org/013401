During its performance verification phase, the soft X-ray instrument eROSITA aboard the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma(SRG)
spacecraft observed large regions in the Magellanic Clouds, where almost 40 known high-mass X-ray
binaries (HMXBs, including candidates) are located. We looked for new HMXBs in the eROSITA data,
searched for pulsations in HMXB candidates and investigated the long-term behaviour of the full
sample using archival X-ray and optical data. For sources sufficiently bright, a detailed spectral
and temporal analysis of their eROSITA data was performed. A source detection analysis of the eROSITA
images in different energy bands provided count rates and upper limits for the remaining sources.
We report the discovery of a new Be/X-ray binary in the Large Magellanic Cloud. The transient SRGEt
J052829.5-690345 was detected with a 0.2-8.0 keV luminosity of ~10^35 erg/s and exhibits a hard
X-ray spectrum, typical for this class of HMXBs. The OGLE I-band light curve of the V~15.7 mag counterpart
shows large variations by up to 0.75 mag, which occur quasi periodically with ~511 days. The eROSITA
observations of the Small Magellanic Cloud covered 16 Be/X-ray binary pulsars, five of them were
bright enough to accurately determine their current pulse period. The pulse periods for SXP 726
and SXP 1323 measured from eROSITA data are ~800 s and ~1006 s, respectively, far away from their discovery
periods. Including archival XMM-Newton observations we update the spin-period history of the
two long-period pulsars which show nearly linear trends in their period evolution since more than
15 years. The corresponding average spin-down rate for SXP 726 is 4.3 s/yr while SXP 1323 shows spin-up
with a rate of -23.2 s/yr. We discuss the spin evolution of the two pulsars in the framework of quasi-spherical
accretion.

We present a comprehensive analysis of the 0.3--5\,$\mu$m transit spectrum for the inflated hot
Jupiter HAT-P-41b. The planet was observed in transit with Hubble STIS and WFC3 as part of the Hubble
Panchromatic Comparative Exoplanet Treasury (PanCET) program, and we combine those data with
warm \textit{Spitzer} transit observations. We extract transit depths from each of the data sets,
presenting the STIS transit spectrum (0.29--0.93\,$\mu$m) for the first time. We retrieve the
transit spectrum both with a free-chemistry retrieval suite (AURA) and a complementary chemical
equilibrium retrieval suite (PLATON) to constrain the atmospheric properties at the day-night
terminator. Both methods provide an excellent fit to the observed spectrum. Both AURA and PLATON
retrieve a metal-rich atmosphere for almost all model assumptions (most likely O/H ratio of $\log_{10}{Z/Z_{\odot}}
= 1.46^{+0.53}_{-0.68}$ and $\log_{10}{Z/Z_{\odot}} = 2.33^{+0.23}_{-0.25}$, respectively);
this is driven by a 4.9-$\sigma$ detection of H$_2$O as well as evidence of gas absorption in the optical
($>$2.7-$\sigma$ detection) due to Na, AlO and/or VO/TiO, though no individual species is strongly
detected. Both retrievals determine the transit spectrum to be consistent with a clear atmosphere,
with no evidence of haze or high-altitude clouds. Interior modeling constraints on the maximum
atmospheric metallicity ($\log_{10}{Z/Z_{\odot}} < 1.7$) favor the AURA results. The inferred
elemental oxygen abundance suggests that HAT-P-41b has one of the most metal-rich atmospheres
of any hot Jupiters known to date. Overall, the inferred high metallicity and high inflation make
HAT-P-41b an interesting test case for planet formation theories.

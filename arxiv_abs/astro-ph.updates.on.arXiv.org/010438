We aim to give a reliable estimate of the number of flaring giant stars in the Kepler field. By analyzing
the flaring activity of these stars we explore their flare statistics and the released flare energies.
The role of oscillation in suppressing magnetic activity is also investigated. On a sample of flaring
giant stars we search for flaring specialities which may be associated with the giant nature. We
search for flares using the full K1 data on a sample of 706 stars compiled from two lists of flaring
giants found in the literature. In the end, we confirm only 61 stars as flaring giants. Among these
61 flaring giants we found only six which also show oscillations; we suggest that a large fraction
of the 61 flaring giants are members of spectroscopic binaries which are proven already for 11. Tests
are carried out to correct the detection bias at low flare energies for a subsample of 19 further studied,
frequently flaring stars. For these 19 stars flare energy distributions and flare frequency diagrams
(FFDs) are constructed. The number of detected flares on giant stars correlate only weakly with
the rotational periods. The 61 confirmed flaring giant stars make up only about 0.3% of the entire
giant star population in the Kepler database, in contrast with previous estimates of about an order
higher percentage. No strong correlation was found between the stellar properties and the flaring
characteristics. The wide scale of the flaring specialities are hardly related to the giant nature,
if at all. This, together with the finding that the observed flare durations correlate with flare
energies, regardless of the flare energy level and stellar luminosity class, suggest common background
physics in flaring stars, or in other words, a general scaling effect behind.

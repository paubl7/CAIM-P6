We present detailed photometric observations of the Galactic globular cluster NGC 7492 using the
data obtained with two far-ultraviolet (FUV: 1300 - 1800 \AA) and three near-ultraviolet (NUV:
2000 - 3000 \AA) filters of Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope (UVIT) on-board the \textit{AstroSat}
satellite. We confirmed the cluster membership of the extracted sources using GAIA data release
2 (Gaia DR2) proper motion data. We have used color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) using UVIT and GAIA
filters to separate out different evolutionary stages of the stars present in the cluster. We have
identified a new extreme horizontal branch (EHB) star at the core of the cluster using UV and UV-optical
CMDs. The estimated distance-modulus of the cluster is $16.95\pm0.05$ obtained by fitting BaSTI
isochrones with cluster parameters, $[Fe/H] = -1.8$ dex and age $= 12.0$ Gyr on the V $-$ I vs V CMD.
Interestingly, only the EHB star and blue horizontal branch stars (BHBs) among the UV-bright hot
sources are detected in FUV filters of UVIT. We have derived the effective temperature of BHBs using
color-temperature relation and spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of multi-band filters,
which are in the range from 8,000 K to 10,500 K. We find a variation of He abundance of BHBs by fitting
the BaSTI ZAHB. The range in the He abundance of the BHBs corresponding to the best fit isochrones
is 0.247 to 0.350. We have estimated various physical parameters of the newly identified EHB star
in the cluster using SED fit and post-HB evolutionary tracks. We have studied the radial distribution
of all the sources of the cluster detected in UVIT. The sources detected in FUV filters extend beyond
the half light radius (1.15$'$) of the cluster, whereas the sources detected in NUV filters extend
beyond the tidal radius (9.2$'$) of the cluster.

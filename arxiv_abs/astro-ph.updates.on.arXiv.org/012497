Context: The energy-limited (EL) atmospheric escape approach is used to estimate mass-loss rates
for a broad range of planets that host hydrogen-dominated atmospheres as well as for performing
atmospheric evolution calculations. Aims: We aim to study the applicability range of the EL approximation.
Methods: We revise the EL formalism and its assumptions. We also compare its results with those of
hydrodynamic simulations, employing a grid covering planets with masses, radii, and equilibrium
temperatures ranging between 1 $M_{\oplus}$ and 39 $M_{\oplus}$, 1 $R_{\oplus}$ and 10 $R_{\oplus}$,
and 300 and 2000 K, respectively. Results: Within the grid boundaries, we find that the EL approximation
gives a correct order of magnitude estimate for mass-loss rates for about 76% of the planets, but
there can be departures from hydrodynamic simulations by up to three orders of magnitude in individual
cases. Furthermore, we find that planets for which the mass-loss rates are correctly estimated
by the EL approximation to within one order of magnitude have intermediate gravitational potentials
as well as low-to-intermediate equilibrium temperatures and irradiation fluxes of extreme ultraviolet
and X-ray radiation. However, for planets with low or high gravitational potentials, or high equilibrium
temperatures and irradiation fluxes, the approximation fails in most cases. Conclusions: The
EL approximation should not be used for planetary evolution calculations that require computing
mass-loss rates for planets that cover a broad parameter space. In this case, it is very likely that
the EL approximation would at times return mass-loss rates of up to several orders of magnitude above
or below those predicted by hydrodynamic simulations. For planetary atmospheric evolution calculations,
interpolation routines or approximations based on grids of hydrodynamic models should be used
instead.

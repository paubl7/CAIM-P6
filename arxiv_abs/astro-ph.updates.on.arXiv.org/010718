Shortly after its discovery, General Relativity (GR) was applied to predict the behavior of our
Universe on the largest scales, and later became the foundation of modern cosmology. Its validity
has been verified on a range of scales and environments from the Solar system to merging black holes.
However, experimental confirmations of GR on cosmological scales have so far lacked the accuracy
one would hope for -- its applications on those scales being largely based on extrapolation and its
validity sometimes questioned in the shadow of the unexpected cosmic acceleration. Future astronomical
instruments surveying the distribution and evolution of galaxies over substantial portions of
the observable Universe, such as the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI), will be able
to measure the fingerprints of gravity and their statistical power will allow strong constraints
on alternatives to GR. In this paper, based on a set of $N$-body simulations and mock galaxy catalogs,
we study the predictions of a number of traditional and novel estimators beyond linear redshift
distortions in two well-studied modified gravity models, chameleon $f(R)$ gravity and a braneworld
model, and the potential of testing these deviations from GR using DESI. These estimators employ
a wide array of statistical properties of the galaxy and the underlying dark matter field, including
two-point and higher-order statistics, environmental dependence, redshift space distortions
and weak lensing. We find that they hold promising power for testing GR to unprecedented precision.
The major future challenge is to make realistic, simulation-based mock galaxy catalogs for both
GR and alternative models to fully exploit the statistic power of the DESI survey and to better understand
the impact of key systematic effects. Using these, we identify future simulation and analysis needs
for gravity tests using DESI.

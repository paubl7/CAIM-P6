The direct detection of exoplanets with high-contrast instruments can be boosted with high spectral
resolution. For integral field spectrographs yielding hyperspectral data, this means that the
field of view consists of diffracted starlight spectra and a spatially localized planet. Analysis
usually relies on cross-correlation with theoretical spectra. In a purely blind-search context,
this supervised strategy can be biased with model mismatch and/or be computationally inefficient.
Using an approach that is inspired by the remote-sensing community, we aim to propose an alternative
to cross-correlation that is fully data-driven, which decomposes the data into a set of individual
spectra and their corresponding spatial distributions. This strategy is called spectral unmixing.
We used an orthogonal subspace projection to identify the most distinct spectra in the field of view.
Their spatial distribution maps were then obtained by inverting the data. These spectra were then
used to break the original hyperspectral images into their corresponding spatial distribution
maps via non-negative least squares. The performance of our method was evaluated and compared with
a cross-correlation using simulated hyperspectral data with medium resolution from the ELT/HARMONI
integral field spectrograph. We show that spectral unmixing effectively leads to a planet detection
solely based on spectral dissimilarities at significantly reduced computational cost. The extracted
spectrum holds significant signatures of the planet while being not perfectly separated from residual
starlight. The sensitivity of the supervised cross-correlation is three to four times higher than
with unsupervised spectral unmixing, the gap is biased toward the former because the injected and
correlated spectrum match perfectly. The algorithm was furthermore vetted on real data obtained
with VLT/SINFONI of the beta Pictoris system.

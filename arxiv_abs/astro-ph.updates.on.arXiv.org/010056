Models for black hole (BH) formation from stellar collapse robustly predict the existence of a pair-instability
supernova (PISN) mass gap: black holes cannot be born with masses in the range $50\,M_\odot\lesssim
m\lesssim 120\,M_\odot$. The reported mass of GW190521's primary black hole, $m_1=85^{+21}_{-14}\,M_\odot$,
falls squarely within this mass gap. Moreover, under the same uninformative priors used for $m_1$,
GW190521's secondary black hole is also likely in the PISN mass gap ($m_2>50\,M_\odot$ at 93\% confidence).
Even in proposed scenarios which can produce BHs in the PISN gap, double mass-gap binary black holes
(BBHs) are expected to be rare. We consider the more conservative alternative that GW190521's secondary
BH belongs to the population of BHs previously observed by LIGO/Virgo, finding $m_2<48\,M_\odot$
at 90\% credibility. With this prior on $m_2$, we automatically find that the mass of the primary
BH has a 39\% probability of being above the gap ($m_1>120\,M_\odot$, or 25\% probability for $m_1>130\,M_\odot$).
This is because the total mass of the system is better constrained than the individual masses. As
long as the prior odds for a double-mass-gap BBH are smaller than $\sim1:15$, it is more likely that
GW190521 straddles the PISN gap. Alternatively, if we assume a gap width of $\gtrsim75\,M_\odot$
as predicted from stellar evolution, and assume that both components of GW190521 are formed from
stellar collapse, we again find that GW190521's BHs straddle the mass gap, with the upper edge of
the gap above $116\,M_\odot$ (90\% credibility). We argue that GW190521 may not present a fundamental
challenge to our understanding of stellar evolution and collapse. Instead, GW190521 may be the
first example of a straddling binary black hole, composed of a conventional stellar mass BH and a
BH from the "far side" of the PISN mass gap.

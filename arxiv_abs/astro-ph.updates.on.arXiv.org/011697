We aim to gain insight into the effect of network and faculae on solar irradiance from their apparent
intensity. Taking full-disc observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory, we examined the
intensity contrast of network and faculae in the continuum and core of the Fe I 6173 {\AA} line and
1700 {\AA}, including the variation with magnetic flux density, distance from disc centre, nearby
magnetic fields, and time. The brightness of network and faculae is believed to be suppressed by
nearby magnetic fields from its effect on convection. The difference in intensity contrast between
the quiet-Sun network and active region faculae, noted by various studies, arises because active
regions are more magnetically crowded and is not due to any fundamental physical differences between
network and faculae. These results highlight that solar irradiance models need to include the effect
of nearby magnetic fields on network and faculae brightness. We found evidence that suggests that
departures from local thermal equilibrium (LTE) might have limited effect on intensity contrast.
This could explain why solar irradiance models that are based on the intensity contrast of solar
surface magnetic features calculated assuming LTE reproduce the observed spectral variability
even where the LTE assumption breaks down. Certain models of solar irradiance employ chromospheric
indices as direct indications of the effect of network and faculae on solar irradiance. Based on
past studies of the Ca II K line and on the intensity contrast measurements derived here, we show that
the fluctuations in chromospheric emission from network and faculae are a reasonable estimate
of the emission fluctuations in the middle photosphere, but not of those in the lower photosphere.
The data set, which extends from 2010 to 2018, indicates that intensity contrast was stable to about
3% in this period.

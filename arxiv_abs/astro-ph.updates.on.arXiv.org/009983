Two repeating FRB sources, FRB180916 (CHIME/FRB Collaboration, 2020) and FRB121102 (Rajwade,
et al., 2020) display periodic windowed behavior (PWB) in the times of FRB detections. In PWB, events
occur only within a periodic window spanning some fraction of the period, but additionally, in FRB121102,
no events are detected at all during many of the periods. During 2020 May, coincident soft gamma bursts
and fast radio bursts (FRBs) observed from SGR1935+2154 (Zhang, et al., 2020) established a clear
link between at least some FRBs and soft gamma repeaters (SGR), and therefore magnetars. The analysis
herein, which selects the period giving the minimum window fraction, shows PWB in this sources soft
gamma-ray emission. For 174 bursts from 2014 through 2020 from IPN (Interplanetary Network) instruments,
a clearly resolved minimum in window fraction vs. period occurrs at a 231 day period, and 55 percent
window fraction. Simulations show that PWB is not effectively identified by standard chi-squared
methods used for pulsars. The data cover only 6 bursting episodes; discovery of events significantly
outside the given windows could seriously change these conclusions. However, it is shown that this
result is robust: First, the IPN has excellent time coverage and is unlikely to miss bursts outside
of these windows. For several data sub-samples, the same period was found, and with large bursting
episodes removed, the same period is among the best two or three. Simulations show that even small
numbers of random bursts cannot show PWB; additionally, random events in the same number of periodic
windows as the data yield errors in the period of order 1 percent for even much smaller data sets. These
checks show the results are not due limited sampling. The periodicity of this SGRs bursts should
therefore provide critical hints as to the mechanism behind the bursts, and by association, FRBs.

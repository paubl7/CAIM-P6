The Supergiant X-ray binary Vela X-1 represents one of the best astrophysical sources to investigate
the wind environment of a O/B star irradiated by an accreting neutron star. Previous studies and
hydrodynamic simulations of the system revealed a clumpy environment and the presence of two wakes:
an accretion wake surrounding the compact object and a photoionisation wake trailing it along the
orbit. Our goal is to conduct, for the first time, high-resolution spectroscopy on Chandra/HETG
data at the orbital phase $\varphi_\mathrm{orb} \approx 0.75$, when the line of sight is crossing
the photoionisation wake. We aim to conduct plasma diagnostics, inferring the structure and the
geometry of the wind. We perform a blind search employing a Bayesian Block algorithm to find discrete
spectral features and identify them thanks to the most recent laboratory results or through atomic
databases. Plasma properties are inferred both with empirical techniques and with photoionisation
models within CLOUDY and SPEX. We detect and identify five narrow radiative recombination continua
(Mg XI-XII, Ne IX-X, O VIII) and several emission lines from Fe, S, Si, Mg, Ne, Al, and Na, including
four He-like triplets (S XV, Si XIII, Mg XI, and Ne IX). Photoionisation models well reproduce the
overall spectrum, except for the near-neutral fluorescence lines of Fe, S, and Si. We conclude that
the plasma is mainly photoionised, but more than one component is most likely present, consistent
with a multi-phase plasma scenario, where denser and colder clumps of matter are embedded in the
hot, photoionised wind of the companion star. Simulations with the future X-ray satellites Athena
and XRISM show that a few hundred seconds of exposure will be sufficient to disentangle the lines
of the Fe K$\alpha$ doublet and the He-like Fe XXV, improving, in general, the determination of the
plasma parameters.

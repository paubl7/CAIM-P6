The Moon exhibits striking geological asymmetries in elevation, crustal thickness, and composition
between its nearside and farside. Although several scenarios have been proposed to explain these
asymmetries, their origin remains debated. Recent remote sensing observations suggest that (1)
the crust on the farside highlands consists of two layers: a primary anorthositic layer with thickness
of ~30-50 km and on top a more mafic-rich layer ~10 km thick; and (2) the nearside exhibits a large area
of low-Ca pyroxene that has been interpreted to have an impact origin. These observations support
the idea that the lunar nearside-farside asymmetries may be the result of a giant impact. Here, using
quantitative numerical modeling, we test the hypothesis that a giant impact on the early Moon can
explain the striking differences in elevation, crustal thickness, and composition between the
nearside and farside of the Moon. We find that a large impactor, impacting the current nearside with
a low velocity, can form a mega-basin and reproduce the characteristics of the crustal asymmetry
and structures comparable to those observed on the current Moon, including the nearside lowlands
and the farside's mafic-rich layer on top of a primordial anorthositic crust. Our model shows that
the excavated deep-seated KREEP (potassium, rare-earth elements, and phosphorus) material,
deposited close to the basin rim, slumps back into the basin and covers the entire basin floor; subsequent
large impacts can transport the shallow KREEP material to the surface, resulting in its observed
distribution. In addition, our model suggests that prior to the asymmetry-forming impact, the
Moon may have had an 182W anomaly compared to the immediate post-giant impact Earth's mantle, as
predicted if the Moon was created through a giant collision with the proto-Earth.

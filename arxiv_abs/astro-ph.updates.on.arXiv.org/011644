Stars form in cold dense cores showing subsonic velocity dispersions. The parental molecular clouds
display higher temperatures and supersonic velocity dispersions. The transition from core to
cloud has been observed in velocity dispersion, but temperature and abundance variations are unknown.
We aim to study the transition from cores to ambient cloud in temperature and velocity dispersion
using a single tracer. We use NH3 (1,1) and (2,2) maps in L1688 from the Green Bank Ammonia Survey,
smoothed to 1', and determine the physical properties from fits. We identify the coherent cores
and study the changes in temperature and velocity dispersion from cores to the surrounding cloud.
We obtain a kinetic temperature map tracing the extended cloud, improving from previous maps tracing
mostly the cores. The cloud is 4-6 K warmer than the cores, and shows a larger velocity dispersion
(diff. = 0.15-0.25 km/s). Comparing to Herschel-based measurements, we find that cores show kinetic
temperature $\approx$1.8 K lower than the dust temperature; while the gas temperature is higher
than the dust temperature in the cloud. We find an average p-NH3 fractional abundance (with respect
to H2) of $(4.2\pm0.2) \times 10^{-9}$ towards the coherent cores, and $(1.4\pm0.1) \times 10^{-9}$
outside the core boundaries. Using stacked spectra, we detect two components, one narrow and one
broad, towards cores and their neighbourhoods. We find the turbulence in the narrow component to
be correlated to the size of the structure (Pearson-r=0.54). With these unresolved regional measurements,
we obtain a turbulence-size relation of ${\sigma}_{v,NT}\propto r^{0.5}$, similar to previous
findings using multiple tracers. We discover that the subsonic component extends up to 0.15 pc beyond
the typical coherent boundaries, unveiling larger extents of the coherent cores and showing gradual
transition to coherence over ~0.2 pc.

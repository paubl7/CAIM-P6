The thermal and kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effects (tSZ, kSZ) probe the thermodynamic properties
of the circumgalactic and intracluster medium (CGM and ICM) of galaxies, groups, and clusters,
since they are proportional, respectively, to the integrated electron pressure and momentum along
the line-of-sight. We present constraints on the gas thermodynamics of CMASS galaxies in the Baryon
Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) using new measurements of the kSZ and tSZ signals obtained
in a companion paper. Combining kSZ and tSZ measurements, we measure within our model the amplitude
of energy injection $\epsilon M_\star c^2$, where $M_\star$ is the stellar mass, to be $\epsilon=(33^{+2}_{-5})\times10^{-6}$,
and the amplitude of the non-thermal pressure profile to be $\alpha_{\rm Nth}=0.30^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$,
indicating that 30% of the total pressure within the virial radius is due to a non-thermal component.
We estimate the effects of including baryons in the modeling of weak-lensing galaxy cross-correlation
measurements using the best fit density profile from the kSZ measurement. Our estimate reduces
the difference between the original theoretical model and the weak-lensing galaxy cross-correlation
measurements in arXiv:1611.08606 by half (50% at most), but does not fully reconcile it. Comparing
the kSZ and tSZ measurements to cosmological simulations, we find that they under predict the CGM
pressure and to a lesser extent the CGM density at larger radii. This suggests that the energy injected
via feedback models in the simulations that we compared against does not sufficiently heat the gas
at these radii. We do not find significant disagreement at smaller radii. These measurements provide
novel tests of current and future simulations. This work demonstrates the power of joint, high signal-to-noise
kSZ and tSZ observations, upon which future cross-correlation studies will improve.

Lyman$-\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission lines are typically found to be redshifted with respect
to the systemic redshifts of galaxies, likely due to resonant scattering of Ly$\alpha$ photons.
Here we measure the average velocity offset for a sample of 96 $z\approx3.3$ Ly$\alpha$ emitters
(LAEs) with a median Ly$\alpha$ flux (luminosity) of $\approx 10^{-17}~\rm erg~cm^{-2}~s^{-1}$
($\approx10^{42}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$) and a median star formation rate (SFR) of $\approx1.3 \rm M_{\odot}
yr^{-1}$ (not corrected for possible dust extinction), detected by the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic
Explorer as part of our MUSEQuBES circumgalactic medium (CGM) survey. By postulating that the stacked
CGM absorption profiles of these LAEs, probed by 8 background quasars, must be centered on the systemic
redshift, we measure an average velocity offset, V$_{\rm offset} = 171 \pm 8$ $\rm km s^{-1}$, between
the Ly$\alpha$ emission peak and the systemic redshift. The observed V$_{\rm offset}$ is lower
by factors of $\approx1.4$ and $\approx2.6$ compared to the velocity offsets measured for narrow-band
selected LAEs and Lyman break galaxies, respectively, which probe galaxies with higher masses
and SFRs. Consistent with earlier studies based on direct measurements for individual objects,
we find that the V$_{\rm offset}$ is correlated with the full width at half-maximum of the red peak
of the Ly$\alpha$ line, and anti-correlated with the rest-frame equivalent width. Moreover, we
find that $V_{\rm offset}$ is correlated with SFR with a sub-linear scaling relation, V$_{\rm offset}\propto
\rm SFR^{0.16\pm0.03}$. Adopting the mass scaling for main sequence galaxies, such a relation
suggests that V$_{\rm offset}$ scales with the circular velocity of the dark matter halos hosting
the LAEs.

We made a multi-wavelength study of the timing and spectral properties of the X-ray pulsar A 0535+262
during a recent giant outburst in November and December 2020. The flux of the pulsar reached a record
value of $\sim$12.5 Crab on 19th November 2020 (MJD 59172). We have used the NuSTAR, Swift, and NICER
data for our study. We have studied the evolution of pulse frequency, pulse profile, and different
spectral parameters during the giant outburst. The variation of pulse fraction in different energy
ranges has been studied. We have detected a \textit q like feature for the X-ray pulsar during the
outburst from the hardness intensity diagram. We investigated the evolution of the pulse period
and found the spin period of the neutron star to be $P = 103.58\pm 0.01$ s based on NuSTAR data during
the rising phase of the outburst. It was found that the spin period decreased with time at a rate of
$\dot P= -1.50\pm 0.05\times10^{-7}$ ss$^{-1}$ during the outburst. The timing results revealed
the presence of highly variable pulse profiles. The pulse profile evolved from a double peak feature
to a single peak in a higher energy range and prominent energy dependence of the pulse profile was
established. The variation of pulse fraction with energy is studied during the different days of
the observations. The cyclotron resonant scattering feature (CRSF) from the spectrum have been
detected at $\sim$44 keV and the corresponding magnetic field is B $\sim$4.9$\times10^{12}$ G.
We have studied the broadband spectrum of the source which can be described by a composite model with
two continuum components -- a blackbody emission and a cut-off power law. An emission line of iron
($K_{\alpha}$) near 6.4 keV has been detected from the energy spectrum.

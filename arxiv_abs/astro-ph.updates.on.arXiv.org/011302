Weak gravitational lensing measurements based on photometry are limited by shape noise, the variance
in the unknown unlensed orientations of the source galaxies. If the source is a disk galaxy with a
well-ordered velocity field, however, velocity field data can support simultaneous inference
of the shear, inclination, and position angle, virtually eliminating shape noise. We use the Fisher
Information Matrix formalism to forecast the precision of this method in the idealized case of a
perfectly ordered velocity field defined on an infinitesimally thin disk. For nearly face-on targets
one shear component, $\gamma_\times$, can be constrained to $0.003\frac{90}{I_0}\frac{25}{n_{\rm
pix}}$ where $I_0$ is the S/N of the central intensity pixel and $n_{\rm pix}$ is the number of pixels
across a diameter enclosing 80\% of the light. This precision degrades with inclination angle,
by a factor of three by $i{=}50^\circ$. Uncertainty on the other shear component, $\gamma_+$, is
about 1.5 (7) times larger than the $\gamma_\times$ uncertainty for targets at $i=10^\circ$ ($50^\circ$).
For arbitrary galaxy position angle on the sky, these forecasts apply not to $\gamma_+$ and $\gamma_\times$
as defined on the sky, but to two eigenvectors in $(\gamma_+, \gamma_\times,\mu)$ space where $\mu$
is the magnification. We also forecast the potential of less expensive partial observations of
the velocity field such as slit spectroscopy. We conclude by outlining some ways in which real galaxies
depart from our idealized model and thus create random or systematic uncertainties not captured
here. In particular, our forecast $\gamma_\times$ precision is currently limited only by the data
quality rather than scatter in galaxy properties because the relevant type of scatter has yet to
be measured.

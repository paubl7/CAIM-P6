Context. The high number of super-Earth and Earth-like planets in the habitable zone (HZ) detected
around M-dwarf stars in the last years has revealed these stellar objects to be the key for planetary
radial velocity (RV) searches. Aims. Using the HARPS-N spectrograph within The HArps-n red Dwarf
Exoplanet Survey (HADES) we reach the precision needed to detect small planets with a few Earth masses
using the RV technique. Methods. We obtained 138 HARPS-N RV measurements between 2013 May and 2020
September of GJ 720 A, classified as an M0.5V star located at a distance of 15.56 pc. To characterize
the stellar variability and to discern the periodic variation due to the Keplerian signals from
those related to stellar activity, the HARPS-N spectroscopic activity indicators and the simultaneous
photometric observations were analyzed. The combined analysis of HARPS-N RVs and activity indicators
let us to address the nature of the periodic signals. The final model and the orbital planetary parameters
were obtained by fitting simultaneously the stellar variability and the Keplerian signal using
a Gaussian process regression and following a Bayesian criterion. Results. The HARPS-N RV periodic
signals around 40 d and 100 d have counterparts at the same frequencies in HARPS-N activity indicators
and photometric light curves. Then we attribute these periodicities to stellar activity the former
period being likely associated with the stellar rotation. GJ 720 A shows the most significant signal
at 19.466$\pm$0.005 d with no counterparts in any stellar activity indices. We hence ascribe this
RV signal, having a semiamplitude of 4.72$\pm$0.27 m/s , to the presence of a sub-Neptune mass planet.
The planet GJ 720 Ab has a minimum mass of 13.64$\pm$0.79 M$_{\oplus}$, it is in circular orbit at
0.119$\pm$0.002 AU from its parent star, and lies inside the inner boundary of the HZ around its parent
star.

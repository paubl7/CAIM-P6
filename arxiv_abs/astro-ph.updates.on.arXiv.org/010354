The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Galactic plane survey (HGPS) is to date the most
comprehensive census of Galactic $\gamma$-ray sources at very high energies (VHE; $100\,\mathrm{GeV}\leq
E\leq 100\,\mathrm{TeV}$). As a consequence of the limited sensitivity of this survey, the 78 detected
$\gamma$-ray sources comprise only a small and biased subsample of the overall population. Still,
numerical modelling allows us to study the VHE $\gamma$-ray source population in the Milky Way based
on this sample. In this work, several azimuth-symmetric and spiral-arm models are compared for
spatial source distribution. The luminosity and radius function of the population are derived
from the source properties of the HGPS data set and are corrected for the sensitivity bias of the HGPS.
Based on these models, VHE source populations are simulated and the subsets of sources detectable
according to the HGPS are compared with HGPS sources. The power-law indices of luminosity and radius
functions are determined to range between $-1.6$ and $-1.9$ for luminosity and $-1.1$ and $-1.6$
for radius. Azimuth-symmetric distributions and a distribution following a four-arm spiral structure
without Galactic bar describe the HGPS data reasonably well. The total number of Galactic VHE sources
is predicted to be in the range from 800 to 7000 with a total luminosity and flux of $(1.6-6.3) \cdot
10^{36}$~ph~s$^{-1}$ and $(3-15) \cdot 10^{-10}$~ph~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$, respectively. Depending
on the model, the HGPS sample accounts for $(68-87)\%$ of the emission of the population in the scanned
region. This suggests that unresolved sources represent a critical component of the diffuse emission
measurable in the HGPS. With the foreseen jump in sensitivity of the Cherenkov Telescope Array,
the number of detectable sources is predicted to increase by a factor between 5 - 9.

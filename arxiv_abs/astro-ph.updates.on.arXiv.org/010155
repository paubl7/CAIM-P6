We present rest-optical spectroscopic properties of a sample of four galaxies in the Atacama Large
Millimeter/submillimeter Array Hubble Ultra Deep Field (ALMA HUDF). These galaxies span the redshift
range $1.41 \leq z \leq 2.54$ and the stellar mass range $10.36\leq\log(M_*/{\rm M}_{\odot})\leq10.91$.
They have existing far-infrared and radio measurements of dust-continuum and molecular gas emission
from which bolometric star-formation rates (SFRs), dust masses, and molecular gas masses have
been estimated. We use new $H$- and $K$-band near-infrared spectra from the Keck/MOSFIRE spectrograph
to estimate SFRs from dust-corrected H$\alpha$ emission (SFR(H$\alpha$)) and gas-phase oxygen
abundances from the ratio [NII]$\lambda 6584$/H$\alpha$. We find that the dust-corrected SFR(H$\alpha$)
is systematically lower than the bolometric SFR by a factor of several, and measure gas-phase oxygen
abundances in a narrow range, $12+\log(\mbox{O/H})=8.59-8.69$ ($0.8-1.0\: (\mbox{O/H})_{\odot}$).
Relative to a large $z\sim 2$ comparison sample from the MOSDEF survey, the ALMA HUDF galaxies scatter
roughly symmetrically around the best-fit linear mass-metallicity relation, providing tentative
evidence for a flattening in the SFR dependence of metallicity at high stellar mass. Combining oxygen
abundances with estimates of dust and molecular gas masses, we show that there is no significant
evolution in the normalization of the dust-to-gas ratio DGR vs. metallicity relation from $z\sim0$
to $z\sim2$. This result is consistent with some semi-analytic models and cosmological simulations
describing the evolution of dust in galaxies. Tracing the actual form of the DGR vs. metallicity
relation at high redshift now requires combined measurements of dust, gas, and metallicity over
a significantly wider range in metallicity.

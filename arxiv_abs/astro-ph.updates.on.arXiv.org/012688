Imaging methods often rely on Bayesian statistical inference strategies to solve difficult imaging
problems. Applying Bayesian methodology to imaging requires the specification of a likelihood
function and a prior distribution, which define the Bayesian statistical model from which the posterior
distribution of the image is derived. Specifying a suitable model for a specific application can
be very challenging, particularly when there is no reliable ground truth data available. Bayesian
model selection provides a framework for selecting the most appropriate model directly from the
observed data, without reference to ground truth data. However, Bayesian model selection requires
the computation of the marginal likelihood (Bayesian evidence), which is computationally challenging,
prohibiting its use in high-dimensional imaging problems. In this work we present the proximal
nested sampling methodology to objectively compare alternative Bayesian imaging models, without
reference to ground truth data. The methodology is based on nested sampling, a Monte Carlo approach
specialised for model comparison, and exploits proximal Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to
scale efficiently to large problems and to tackle models that are log-concave and not necessarily
smooth (e.g., involving L1 or total-variation priors). The proposed approach can be applied computationally
to problems of dimension O(10^6) and beyond, making it suitable for high-dimensional inverse imaging
problems. It is validated on large Gaussian models, for which the likelihood is available analytically,
and subsequently illustrated on a range of imaging problems where it is used to analyse different
choices for the sparsifying dictionary and measurement model.

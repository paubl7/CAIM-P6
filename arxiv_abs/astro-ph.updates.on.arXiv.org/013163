Young brown dwarfs are analogs to giant exoplanets, as they share effective temperatures, near-infrared
colors, and surface gravities. Thus, the detailed characterization of young brown dwarfs might
shed light on the study of giant exoplanets, that we are currently unable to observe with sufficient
signal-to-noise to allow precise characterization of their atmospheres. 2MASS J22081363+2921215
is a young L3 brown dwarf, member of the beta-Pictoris young moving group (23 +/-3 Myr), that shares
its effective temperature and mass with the beta Pictoris b giant exoplanet. We performed a ~2.5
hr spectro-photometric J-band monitoring of 2MASS J22081363+2921215 with the MOSFIRE multi-object
spectrograph, installed at the Keck I telescope. We measured a minimum variability amplitude of
3.22 +/- 0.42 % for its J-band light curve. The ratio between the maximum and the minimum flux spectra
of 2MASS J22081363+2921215 shows a weak wavelength dependence and a potential enhanced variability
amplitude in the alkali lines. Further analysis suggests that the variability amplitude on the
alkali lines is higher than the overall variability amplitude (4.5-11 %, depending on the lines).
The variability amplitudes in these lines are lower if we degrade the resolution of the original
MOSFIRE spectra to R~100, which explains why this potential enhanced variability in the alkali
lines has not been found previously in HST/WFC3 light curves. Using radiative-transfer models,
we obtained the different cloud layers that might be introducing the spectro-photometric variability
we observe for 2MASS J22081363+2921215, that further support the measured enhanced variability
amplitude in the alkali lines. We provide an artistic recreation of the vertical cloud structure
of this beta-Pictoris b analog.

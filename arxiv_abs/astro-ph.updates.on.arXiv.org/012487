Under certain rather prevalent conditions (driven by dynamical orbital evolution), a hierarchical
triple stellar system can be well approximated, from the standpoint of orbital parameter estimation,
as two binary star systems combined. Even under this simplifying approximation, the inference
of orbital elements is a challenging technical problem because of the high dimensionality of the
parameter space, and the complex relationships between those parameters and the observations
(astrometry and radial velocity). In this work we propose a new methodology for the study of triple
hierarchical systems using a Bayesian Markov-Chain Monte Carlo-based framework. In particular,
graphical models are introduced to describe the probabilistic relationship between parameters
and observations in a dynamically self-consistent way. As information sources we consider the
cases of isolated astrometry, isolated radial velocity, as well as the joint case with both types
of measurements. Graphical models provide a novel way of performing a factorization of the joint
distribution (of parameter and observations) in terms of conditional independent components
(factors), so that the estimation can be performed in a two-stage process that combines different
observations sequentially. Our framework is tested against three well-studied benchmark cases
of triple systems, where we determine the inner and outer orbital elements, coupled with the mutual
inclination of the orbits, and the individual stellar masses, along with posterior probability
(density) distributions for all these parameters. Our results are found to be consistent with previous
studies. We also provide a mathematical formalism to reduce the dimensionality in the parameter
space for triple hierarchical stellar systems in general.

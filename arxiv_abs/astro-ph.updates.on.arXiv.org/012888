The $\it{eROSITA}$ Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS), completed during the calibration and
performance verification phase of the $\it{eROSITA}$ instrument on $\it{Spectrum\, Roentgen\,
Gamma}$, delivers data at and beyond the final depth of the four-year $\it{eROSITA}$ all-sky survey
(eRASS:8), $f_{0.5-2\,\text{ keV}}$ = $1.1\times10^{-14}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{2}$, over 140 deg$^{2}$.
It provides the first view of normal galaxy X-ray emission from X-ray binaries (XRBs) and the hot
interstellar medium at the full depth of eRASS:8. We use the Heraklion Extragalactic Catalogue
(HECATE) of galaxies to correlate with eFEDS X-ray sources and identify 94 X-ray detected normal
galaxies. We classify galaxies as star-forming, early-type, composite, and AGN using SDSS and
6dF optical spectroscopy. The eFEDS field harbours 37 normal galaxies: 36 late-type (star-forming)
galaxies and 1 early-type galaxy. There are 1.9 times as many normal galaxies as predicted by scaling
relations via SIXTE simulations, with an overabundance of late-type galaxies and a dearth of early-type
galaxies. Dwarf galaxies with high specific star formation rate (SFR) have elevated L$_{\text{X}}$/SFR
when compared with specific SFR and metallicity, indicating an increase in XRB emission due to low-metallicity.
We expect that eRASS:8 will detect 12,500 normal galaxies, the majority of which will be star-forming,
with the caveat that there are unclassified sources in eFEDS and galaxy catalogue incompleteness
issues that could increase the actual number of detected galaxies over these current estimates.
eFEDS observations detected a rare population of galaxies -- the metal-poor dwarf starbursts --
that do not follow known scaling relations. eRASS is expected to discover significant numbers of
these high-redshift analogues, which are important for studying the heating of the intergalactic
medium at high-redshift.

Large galaxies may contain an "atmosphere" of hot interstellar X-ray gas, and the temperature and
radial density profile of this gas can be used to measure the total mass of the galaxy contained within
a given radius r. We use this technique for 102 early-type galaxies (ETGs) with stellar masses M_*
> 10^10 M_Sun, to evaluate the mass fraction of dark matter (DM) within the fiducial radius r = 5 r_e,
denoted f_5 = f_{DM}(5r_e). On average, these systems have a median f_5 = 0.8 - 0.9 with a typical galaxy-to-galaxy
scatter +-0.15. Comparisons with mass estimates made through the alternative techniques of satellite
dynamics (e.g. velocity distributions of globular clusters, planetary nebulae, satellite dwarfs)
as well as strong lensing show encouraging consistency over the same range of stellar mass. We find
that many of the disk galaxies (S0/SA0/SB0) have a significantly higher mean $f_5$ than do the pure
ellipticals, by Delta f_5 = 0.1. We suggest that this higher level may be a consequence of sparse stellar
haloes and quieter histories with fewer major episodes of feedback or mergers. Comparisons are
made with the Magneticum Pathfinder suite of simulations for both normal and centrally dominant
"Brightest Cluster" galaxies. Though the observed data exhibit somewhat larger scatter at a given
galaxy mass than do the simulations, the mean level of DM mass fraction for all classes of galaxies
is in good first-order agreement with the simulations. Lastly, we find that the group galaxies with
stellar masses near M_* ~ 10^11 M_Sun have relatively more outliers at low $f_5$ than in other mass
ranges, possibly the result of especially effective AGN feedback in that mass range leading to expansion
of their dark matter halos.

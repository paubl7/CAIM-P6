By tracing the orbital and star formation histories of galaxies within the Coma cluster, we seek
to understand the role of the high-density cluster environment in quenching these galaxies. We
combine star-formation histories extracted from high-signal-to-noise spectra of 11 early-type
galaxies around the center of the Coma cluster with probability distributions for their orbital
parameters obtained using an N-body simulation to connect their orbital and star formation histories.
We find that all 11 galaxies likely quenched near their first pericentric approach. Higher stellar
mass galaxies ($\log(M_\star/\mathrm{M}_\odot)>10$) had formed a higher fraction of their stellar
mass (more than $\sim90\%$) than their lower mass counterparts ($\sim 80$-$90\%$) by the time they
fell into the cluster (when they cross $2.5r_\mathrm{vir}$). We find that the expected infall occurred
around $z\sim0.6$, followed by the first pericentric passage $\sim4\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ later. Galaxies
in our sample formed a significant fraction of their stellar mass, up to $15\%$, between infall and
first pericenter, and had assembled more than $\sim98\%$ of their cumulative stellar mass by first
pericenter. Unlike previous low-redshift studies which suggest that star formation continues
until about first apocenter or later, the high percentage of stellar mass already formed by first
pericenter in our sample galaxies points to star formation ceasing within a gigayear after the first
pericentric passage. We consider the possible physical mechanisms driving quenching and find
that our results resemble the situation in clusters at $z\sim1$, where active stripping of gas (ram-pressure
or tidally driven) seems to be required to quench satellites by their first pericentric passage.
However, a larger sample will be required to conclusively account for the unknown fraction of pre-processed
satellites in the Coma cluster.

The recent launches of Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SO) and BepiColombo, along with
several older spacecraft, have provided the opportunity to study the solar wind at multiple latitudes
and distances from the Sun simultaneously. We take advantage of this unique spacecraft constellation,
along with low solar activity across two solar rotations between May and July 2020, to investigate
how the Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS) structure varies with latitude. We visualise the sector
structure of the inner heliosphere by ballistically mapping the polarity and solar wind speed from
several spacecraft onto the Sun's source surface. We compare this observed sector structure, and
the local orientations of the boundaries, to a predicted HCS. We show that fine scale ripples in the
HCS can be resolved down to several degrees in longitude, with solar wind speed being a useful indicator
of when a spacecraft is near the HCS without changing magnetic polarity. We found that the local orientation
of sector boundaries were broadly consistent with the shape of the HCS but were steepened due to compression
from stream interaction regions. We identified several transient magnetic clouds associated
with HCS crossings, and have shown that these could disrupt the local HCS orientation up to five days
after their passage, but did not significantly affect the position of the HCS. This spacecraft constellation,
along with ballistic mapping, can reveal the structure of the HCS on scales of a few degrees in longitude
and latitude, while discerning between co-rotating and transient structures. This also provides
an accurate representation of the solar wind within $\pm 10^{\circ}$ latitude, which could be used
as a more rigorous constraint on solar wind models and future space weather predictions. In the future,
this range of latitudes will increase as SO's orbit becomes more inclined.

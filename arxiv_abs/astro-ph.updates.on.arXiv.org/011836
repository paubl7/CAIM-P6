X-ray studies of jellyfish galaxies play a crucial role in understanding the interactions between
the interstellar medium (ISM) and the intracluster medium (ICM). In this paper, we focused on the
jellyfish galaxy JO201. By combining archival Chandra observations, MUSE H$\alpha$ cubes, and
maps of the emission fraction of the diffuse ionised gas, we investigated both its high energy spectral
properties and the spatial correlation between its X-ray and optical emissions. The X-ray emission
of JO201 is provided by both the Compton thick AGN (L$_{\text{X}}^{0.5-10 \text{keV}}$=2.7$\cdot$10$^{41}$
erg s$^{-1}$, not corrected for intrinsic absorption) and an extended component (L$_{\text{X}}^{0.5-10
\, \text{keV}}\approx$ 1.9-4.5$\cdot$10$^{41}$ erg s$^{-1}$) produced by a warm plasma (kT$\approx$1
keV), whose luminosity is higher than expected from the observed star formation (L$_{\text{X}}\sim$3.8$\cdot10^{40}$
erg s$^{-1}$). The spectral analysis showed that the X-ray emission is consistent with the thermal
cooling of hot plasma. These properties are similar to the ones found in other jellyfish galaxies
showing extended X-ray emission. A point-to-point analysis revealed that this X-ray emission
closely follows the ISM distribution, whereas CLOUDY simulations proved that the ionisation triggered
by this warm plasma would be able to reproduce the [OI]/H$\alpha$ excess observed in JO201. We conclude
that the galactic X-ray emitting plasma is originated on the surface of the ISM as a result of the ICM-ISM
interplay. This process would entail the cooling and accretion of the ICM onto the galaxy, which
could additionally fuel the star formation, and the emergence of [OI]/H$\alpha$ excess in the optical
spectrum.

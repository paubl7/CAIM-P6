The Lyman-alpha forest is the large-scale structure probe for which we appear to have modeling control
to the highest wavenumbers, which makes it of great interest for constraining the warmness/fuzziness
of the dark matter and the timing of reionization processes. However, the standard statistic, the
Lyman-alpha forest power spectrum, is unable to strongly constrain the IGM temperature-density
relation, and this inability further limits how well other high wavenumber-sensitive parameters
can be constrained. With the aim of breaking these degeneracies, we measure the power spectrum of
the Lyman-beta forest and its cross correlation with the coeveal Lyman-alpha forest using the one
hundred spectra of z=3.5-4.5 quasars in the VLT/X-Shooter XQ-100 Legacy Survey, motivated by the
Lyman-beta transition's smaller absorption cross section that makes it sensitive to somewhat
higher densities relative to the Lyman-alpha transition. Our inferences from this measurement
for the IGM temperature-density relation appear to latch consistently onto the recent tight lower-redshift
Lyman-alpha forest constraints of arXiv:2009.00016v1 [astro-ph.CO]. The z=3.4-4.7 trends we
find using the Lyman-alpha--Lyman-beta cross correlation show a flattening of the slope of the
temperature-density relation with decreasing redshift. This is the trend anticipated from ongoing
HeII reionization and there being sufficient time to reach the asymptotic temperature-density
slope after hydrogen reionization completes. Furthermore, our measurements provide a consistency
check on IGM models that explain the Lyman-alpha forest, with the cross correlation being immune
to systematics that are uncorrelated between the two forests, such as metal line contamination.

Due to their small mass, subsolar mass black hole binaries would have to be primordial in origin instead
of the result of stellar evolution. Soon after formation in the early universe, primordial black
holes can form binaries after decoupling from the cosmic expansion. Alternatively, primordial
black holes as dark matter could also form binaries in the late universe due to dynamical encounters
and gravitational-wave braking. A significant feature for this channel is the possibility that
some sources retain nonzero eccentricity in the LIGO/Virgo band. Assuming all dark matter is primordial
black holes with a delta function mass distribution, $1M_\odot-1M_\odot$ binaries formed in this
late-universe channel can be detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo with their design sensitivities
at a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1)$/year, where $12\%(3\%)$ of events have eccentricity at a gravitational-wave
frequency of 10 Hz, $e^\mathrm{10Hz}\geq0.01(0.1)$, and nondetection can constrain the binary
formation rate within this model. Third generation detectors would be expected to detect subsolar
mass eccentric binaries as light as $0.01 M_\odot$ within this channel, if they accounted for the
majority of the dark matter. Furthermore, we use simulated gravitational-wave data to study the
ability to search for eccentric gravitational-wave signals using a quasi-circular waveform template
bank with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity. For a match-filtering targeted search, assuming binaries
with a delta function mass of $0.1(1)M_\odot$ and the eccentricity distribution derived from this
late-universe formation channel, $41\%(6\%)$ of the signals would be missed compared to the ideal
detection rate due to the mismatch in the gravitational-wave signal from eccentricity.

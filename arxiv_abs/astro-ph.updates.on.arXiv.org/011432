Recent high precision meteoritic data improve constraints on the formation timescale and bulk
composition of the terrestrial planets. High resolution N-body simulations allow direct comparison
of embryo growth timescale and accretion zones to these constraints. In this paper, we present results
of high resolution simulations for embryo formation from a disc of up to 41,000 fully-self gravitating
planetesimals with the GPU-based N-body code GENGA. Our results indicate that the growth of embryos
are highly dependent on the initial conditions. More massive initial planetesimals, a shorter
gas disc decay timescale and initially eccentric Jupiter and Saturn (EJS) all lead to faster growth
of embryos. Asteroid belt material can thereby be implanted into the terrestrial planet region
via sweeping secular resonances. This could possibly explain the rapid growth of Mars within 10
Myr inferred from its Hf-W chronology. The sweeping secular resonance almost completely clears
the asteroid belt and deposits this material in the Mercury-Venus region, altering the composition
of embryos there. This could result in embryos in the Mercury-Venus region accreting an unexpectedly
high mass fraction from beyond 2 AU. Changing the initial orbits of Jupiter and Saturn to more circular
(CJS) or assuming embryos formed in a gas free environment removes the sweeping secular resonance
effect and thus greatly decreases material accreted from beyond 2 AU for Mercury-Venus region embryos.
We therefore propose that rock samples from Mercury and Venus could aid greatly in deducing the condition
and lifetime of the initial protoplanetary gas disc during planetesimal and embryo formation,
as well as the initial architecture of the giant planets.

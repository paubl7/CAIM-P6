[abridged] Efficient absorption of stellar UV and visible radiation by TiO and VO is predicted to
drive temperature inversions in the upper atmospheres of hot Jupiters. However, few inversions
or detections of TiO or VO have been reported, and results are often contradictory. Using the improved
ExoMol Toto line list, we searched for TiO emission in the dayside spectrum of WASP-33b using the
same data in which the molecule was previously detected with an older line list at 4.8$\sigma$. We
intended to confirm the molecular detection and quantify the signal improvement offered by the
ExoMol Toto line list. Data from the High Dispersion Spectrograph on the Subaru Telescope was extracted
and reduced in an identical manner to the previous study. Stellar and telluric contamination were
then removed. High-resolution TiO emission models of WASP-33b were created using the radiative
transfer code petitRADTRANS and cross-correlated with the data. We measure a 4.3$\sigma$ TiO emission
signature using the ExoMol Toto models, corresponding to a WASP-33b orbital velocity semi-amplitude
of $K_\mathrm{p}=252.9^{+5.0}_{-5.3}\ \mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$ and a system velocity of $v_\mathrm{sys}=-23.0^{+4.7}_{-4.6}\
\mathrm{km\ s^{-1}}$. Injection-recovery tests using models based on the new and earlier line
lists indicate that if the new models provide a perfect match to the planet spectrum, the significance
of the TiO detection should have increased by a factor of $\sim$2. Although the TiO signal we find
is statistically significant, comparison with previous works makes our result too ambiguous to
claim a clear-cut detection. Unexpectedly, the new ExoMol Toto models provide a weaker signal than
that found previously, which is offset in $K_\mathrm{p}$-$v_\mathrm{sys}$ space. This sheds
some doubt on both detections, especially in light of a recently published TiO non-detection using
a different dataset.

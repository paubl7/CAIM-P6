Black hole-neutron star (BHNS) mergers are thought to be sources of gravitational waves (GWs) with
coincident electromagnetic (EM) counterparts. To further probe whether these systems are viable
progenitors of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs) and kilonovae, and how one may use (the lack of) EM
counterparts associated with LIGO/Virgo candidate BHNS GW events to sharpen parameter estimation,
we study the impact of neutron star spin in BHNS mergers. Using dynamical spacetime magnetohydrodynamic
simulations of BHNSs initially on a quasicircular orbit, we survey configurations that differ
in the BH spin ($a_{\rm BH}/M_{\rm BH}=0$ and $0.75$), the NS spin ($a_{\rm NS}/M_{\rm NS}=-0.17,\,0,\,0.23$
and $0.33$), and the binary mass ratio ($q\equiv M_{\rm BH}:M_{\rm NS}=3:1$ and $5:1$). The general
trend we find is that increasing the NS prograde spin increases both the rest mass of the accretion
disk onto the remnant black hole, and the rest mass of dynamically ejected matter. By a time~$\Delta
t\sim 3500-5500M\sim 88-138(M_{\rm NS}/1.4M_\odot)\,\rm ms$ after the peak gravitational wave
amplitude, a magnetically--driven jet is launched only for $q=3:1$ regardless of the initial NS
spin. The lifetime of the jets [$\Delta t\sim 0.5-0.8(M_{\rm NS}/1.4 M_\odot)\,\rm s$] and their
outgoing Poynting luminosity [$L_{\rm Poyn}\sim 10^{51.5\pm 0.5}\,\rm erg/s$] are consistent
with typical sGRBs luminosities and expectations from the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. By the
time we terminate our simulations, we do not observe either an outflow or a large-scale magnetic
field collimation for the other systems we considered. The mass range of dynamically ejected matter
is $10^{-4.5}-10^{-2}~(M_{\rm NS}/1.4M_\odot)M_\odot$, which can power kilonovae with peak
bolometric luminosities $L_{\rm knova}\sim 10^{40}-10^{41.4}$ erg/s with rise times $\lesssim
6.5\,\rm h$ and potentially detectable by the LSST.

Astrophysical fluid flow studies often encompass a wide range of physical processes to account
for the complexity of the system under consideration. In addition to gravity, a proper treatment
of thermodynamic processes via continuum radiation transport and/or photoionization is becoming
the state of the art. We present a major update of our continuum radiation transport module, MAKEMAKE,
and a newly developed module for photoionization, SEDNA, coupled to the magnetohydrodynamics
code PLUTO. These extensions are currently not publicly available; access can be granted on a case-by-case
basis. We explain the theoretical background of the equations solved, elaborate on the numerical
layout, and present a comprehensive test suite for radiation-ionization hydrodynamics. The grid-based
radiation and ionization modules support static one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional
grids in Cartesian, cylindrical, and spherical coordinates. Each module splits the radiation
field into two components, one originating directly from a point source - solved using a ray-tracing
scheme - and a diffuse component - solved with a three-dimensional flux-limited diffusion (FLD)
solver. The FLD solver for the continuum radiation transport makes use of either the equilibrium
one-temperature approach or the linearization two-temperature approach. The FLD solver for the
photoionization module enables accounting for the temporal evolution of the radiation field from
direct recombination of free electrons into hydrogen's ground state as an alternative to the on-the-spot
approximation. A brief overview of completed and ongoing scientific studies is given to explicitly
illustrate the multipurpose nature of the numerical framework presented.

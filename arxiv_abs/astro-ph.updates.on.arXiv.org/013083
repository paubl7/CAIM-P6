In the present work, we study slow-roll inflation in scalar-tensor gravity theories in the presence
of both the non-minimal coupling between the scalar field and curvature, and the Galileon self-interaction
of the scalar field. Furthermore, we give predictions for the duration of reheating as well as for
the reheating temperature after inflation. After working out the expressions for the power spectra
of scalar and tensor perturbations in the case of a general non-minimal coupling function that depends
solely on the scalar field and a general scalar potential, we focus on the special cases of the power-law
coupling function and chaotic quadratic inflation. Thus, under the slow-roll approximation we
confront the predictions of the model with the current PLANCK constraints on the spectral index
$n_s$ and the tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ using the $n_{s}-r$ plane. We found that the combination
of the non-minimal coupling and Galileon self-interaction effects allows us to obtain better results
for $r$ than in the case in which each effect is considered separately. Particularly, we obtained
that the predictions of the model are in agreement with the current observational bounds on $n_{s}$
and $r$ within the $95 \%$ C.L region and also slightly inside the $68 \%$ C.L region. Also, we investigate
the oscillatory regime after the end of inflation by solving the full background equations, and
then we determine the upper bound for the Galileon and non-minimal coupling parameters under the
condition that the scalar field oscillates coherently during reheating. Finally, after approximating
reheating by a constant equation of state, we derive the relations between the reheating duration,
the temperature at the end of reheating, its equation of state, and the number of $e$-folds of inflation
and then we relate all them with the inflationary observables.

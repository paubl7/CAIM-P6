GCIRS 7, the brightest star in the Galactic central parsec, formed $6\pm2$ Myr ago together with
dozens of massive stars in a disk orbiting the central black-hole. It has been argued that GCIRS 7
is a pulsating body, on the basis of photometric variability. We present the first medium-resolution
($R=500$), K-band spectro-interferometric observations of GCIRS 7, using the GRAVITY instrument
with the four auxiliary telescopes of the ESO VLTI. We looked for variations using two epochs, namely
2017 and 2019. We find GCIRS 7 to be moderately resolved with a uniform-disk photospheric diameter
of $\theta^*_\text{UD}=1.55 \pm 0.03$ mas ($R^*_\text{UD}=1368 \pm 26$ $R_\odot$) in the K-band
continuum. The narrow-band uniform-disk diameter increases above 2.3 $\mu$m, with a clear correlation
with the CO band heads in the spectrum. This correlation is aptly modeled by a hot ($T_\text{L}=2368\pm37$
K), geometrically thin molecular shell with a diameter of $\theta_\text{L}=1.74\pm0.03$ mas,
as measured in 2017. The shell diameter increased ($\theta_\text{L}=1.89\pm0.03$ mas), while
its temperature decreased ($T_\text{L}=2140\pm42$ K) in 2019. In contrast, the photospheric
diameter $\theta^*_\text{UD}$ and the extinction up to the photosphere of GCIRS 7 ($A_{\mathrm{K}_\mathrm{S}}=3.18
\pm 0.16$) have the same value within uncertainties at the two epochs. In the context of previous
interferometric and photo-spectrometric measurements, the GRAVITY data allow for an interpretation
in terms of photospheric pulsations. The photospheric diameter measured in 2017 and 2019 is significantly
larger than previously reported using the PIONIER instrument ($\theta_*=1.076 \pm 0.093$ mas
in 2013 in the H band). The parameters of the photosphere and molecular shell of GCIRS 7 are comparable
to those of other red supergiants that have previously been studied using interferometry.

While observations of many high-precision radio pulsars of order $\lesssim1~\mu$s across the
sky are needed for the detection and characterization of a stochastic background of low-frequency
gravitational waves (GWs), sensitivity to single sources of GWs requires even higher timing precision.
The Argentine Institute of Radio Astronomy (IAR; Instituto Argentino de Radioastronom\'ia) has
begun observations of the brightest-known millisecond pulsar, J0437$-$4715. Even though the
two antennas are smaller than other single-dish telescopes previously used for pulsar timing array
(PTA) science, the IAR's capability to monitor this pulsar daily coupled with the pulsar's brightness
allows for high-precision pulse arrival-time measurements. While upgrades of the facility are
currently underway, we show that modest improvements beyond current plans will provide IAR with
unparalleled sensitivity to this pulsar. The most stringent upper limits on single GW sources come
from the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav). Observations
of PSR J0437$-$4715 will provide a significant sensitivity increase in NANOGrav's "blind spot"
in the sky where fewer pulsars are currently being observed. With state-of-the-art instrumentation
installed, we estimate the array's sensitivity will improve by a factor of $\approx$2-4 over 10
years for 20% of the sky with the inclusion of this pulsar as compared to a static version of the PTA
used in NANOGrav's most recent limits. More modest instrumentation result in factors of $\approx$1.4-3.
We identify four other candidate pulsars as suitable for inclusion in PTA efforts. International
PTA efforts will also benefit from inclusion of these data given the potential achievable sensitivity.

Geochronology, or determination of absolute ages for geologic events, underpins many inquiries
into the formation and evolution of planets and our Solar System. Absolute ages of ancient and recent
magmatic products provide strong constraints on the dynamics of magma oceans and crustal formation,
as well as the longevity and evolution of interior heat engines and distinct mantle/crustal source
regions. Absolute dating also relates habitability markers to the timescale of evolution of life
on Earth. However, the number of geochronologically-significant terrains across the inner Solar
System far exceeds our ability to conduct sample return from all of them. In preparation for the upcoming
Decadal Survey, our team formulated a set of medium-class (New Frontiers) mission concepts to three
different locations (the Moon, Mars, and Vesta) where sites that record Solar System bombardment,
magmatism, and/or habitability are uniquely preserved and accessible. We developed a notional
payload to directly date planetary surfaces, consisting of two instruments capable of measuring
radiometric ages in situ, an imaging spectrometer, optical cameras to provide site geologic context
and sample characterization, a trace element analyzer to augment sample contextualization, and
a sample acquisition and handling system. Landers carrying this payload to the Moon, Mars, and Vesta
would likely fit into the New Frontiers cost cap in our study (~$1B). A mission of this type would provide
crucial constraints on planetary history while also enabling a broad suite of investigations such
as basic geologic characterization, geomorphologic analysis, ground truth for remote sensing
analyses, analyses of major, minor, trace, and volatile elements, atmospheric and other long-lived
monitoring, organic molecule analyses, and soil and geotechnical properties.

Context: Observations at the radio continuum band below the gigahertz band are key when the nature
and properties of nonthermal sources are investigated because their radio radiation is strongest
at these frequencies. The low radio frequency range is therefore the best to spot possible counterparts
to very high-energy (VHE) sources: relativistic particles of the same population are likely to
be involved in radio and high-energy radiation processes. Some of these counterparts to VHE sources
can be stellar sources. Aims: The Cygnus region in the northern sky is one of the richest in this type
of sources that are potential counterparts to VHE sources. We surveyed the central ~15sq deg of the
Cygnus constellation at the 325 and 610~MHz bands with angular resolutions and sensitivities of
10" and 6", and 0.5 and 0.2 mJy/beam, respectively. Methods: The data were collected during 172 hours
in 2013 - 2017, using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) with 32MHz bandwidth, and were calibrated
using the SPAM routines. The source extraction was carried out with the PyBDSF tool, followed by
verification through visual inspection of every putative catalog candidate source in order to
determine its reliability. Results: In this first paper we present the catalog of sources, consisting
of 1048 sources at 325 MHz and 2796 sources at 610MHz. By cross-matching the sources from both frequencies
with the objects of the SIMBAD database, we found possible counterparts for 143 of them. Most of the
sources from the 325-MHz catalog (993) were detected at the 610MHz band, and their spectral index
alpha was computed adopting S(nu) ~ nu^alpha. The maximum of the spectral index distribution is
at alpha=-1, which is characteristic of nonthermal emitters and might indicate an extragalactic
population.

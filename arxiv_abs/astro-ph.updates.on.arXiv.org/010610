The aim of the present work is to better understand the gravitational drag forces, so-called dynamical
friction, acting on massive objects moving through a finite-temperature superfluid background.
This is relevant for models of dark matter consisting of light scalar particles with weak self-interactions
that require non-zero temperature, or that have been heated inside galaxies. Expressions for the
dynamical friction are derived using linear perturbation theory, and compared to numerical simulations
in which non-linear effects are included. After testing and improving the linear result, it is applied
to the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Fornax, and its five gravitationally bound globular clusters. By
estimating the rate at which these globular clusters are expected to sink into their host halo due
to dynamical friction, limits on the superfluid dark matter parameter space are inferred. The dynamical
friction in a finite-temperature superfluid is found to behave very similarly to the zero-temperature
limit, even when the thermal contributions are large. However, when a critical velocity for the
superfluid flow is included, the friction force can transition from the zero-temperature value
to the value in a conventional fluid. Increasing the mass of the perturbing object induces a similar
transition as when lowering the critical velocity. When applied to Fornax and its globular clusters,
it is found that the parameter space preferred in the literature for a zero-temperature superfluid
yields decay times in agreement with observations. However, the present work suggests that increasing
the temperature, which is expected to change the preferred parameter space, may lead to too small
decay times, and therefore pose a problem for finite-temperature superfluid models of dark matter.

We present a new, updated version of the EuclidEmulator (called EuclidEmulator2), a fast and accurate
predictor for the nonlinear correction of the matter power spectrum. Percent-level accurate emulation
is now supported in the eight-dimensional parameter space of $w_0w_a$CDM$+\sum m_\nu$models
between redshift $z=0$ and $z=3$ for spatial scales within the range 0.01 $h$/Mpc $\leq k \leq$ 10
$h$/Mpc. In order to achieve this level of accuracy, we have had to improve the quality of the underlying
N-body simulations used as training data: (1) we use self-consistent linear evolution of non-dark
matter species such as massive neutrinos, photons, dark energy and the metric field, (2) we perform
the simulations in the so-called N-body gauge, which allows one to interpret the results in the framework
of general relativity, (3) we run over 250 high-resolution simulations with $3000^3$ particles
in boxes of 1 (Gpc/$h$)${}^3$ volumes based on paired-and-fixed initial conditions and (4) we provide
a resolution correction that can be applied to emulated results as a post-processing step in order
to drastically reduce systematic biases on small scales due to residual resolution effects in the
simulations. We find that the inclusion of the dynamical dark energy parameter $w_a$ significantly
increases the complexity and expense of creating the emulator. The high fidelity of EuclidEmulator2
is tested in various comparisons against N-body simulations as well as alternative fast predictors
like Halofit, HMCode and CosmicEmu. A blind test is successfully performed against the Euclid Flagship
v2.0 simulation. Nonlinear correction factors emulated with EuclidEmulator2 are accurate at
the level of 1% or better for 0.01 $h$/Mpc $\leq k \leq$ 10 $h$/Mpc and $z\leq3$ compared to high-resolution
dark matter only simulations. EuclidEmulator2 is publicly available at https://github.com/miknab/EuclidEmulator2

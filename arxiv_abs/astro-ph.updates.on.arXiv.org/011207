Gravitational waves can probe the existence of planetary-mass primordial black holes. Considering
a mass range of $[10^{-7}-10^{-2}]M_\odot$, inspiraling primordial black holes could emit either
continuous gravitational waves, quasi-monochromatic signals that last for many years, or transient
continuous waves, signals whose frequency evolution follows a power law and last for $\mathcal{O}$(hours-months).
We show that primordial black hole binaries in our galaxy may produce detectable gravitational
waves for different mass functions and formation mechanisms. In order to detect these inspirals,
we adapt methods originally designed to search for gravitational waves from asymmetrically rotating
neutron stars. The first method, the Frequency-Hough, exploits the continuous, quasi-monochromatic
nature of inspiraling black holes that are sufficiently light and far apart such that their orbital
frequencies can be approximated as linear with a small spin-up. The second method, the Generalized
Frequency-Hough, drops the assumption of linearity and allows the signal frequency to follow a
power-law evolution. We explore the parameter space to which each method is sensitive, derive a
theoretical sensitivity estimate, determine optimal search parameters and calculate the computational
cost of all-sky and directed searches. We forecast limits on the abundance of primordial black holes
within our galaxy, showing that we can constrain the fraction of dark matter that primordial black
holes compose, $f_{\rm PBH}$, to be $f_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 1$ for chirp masses between $[4\times
10^{-5}-10^{-3}]M_\odot$ for current detectors. For the Einstein Telescope, we expect the constraints
to improve to $f_{\rm PBH}\lesssim 10^{-2}$ for chirp masses between [$10^{-4}-10^{-3}]M_\odot$.

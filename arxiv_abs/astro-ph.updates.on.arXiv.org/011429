Modelling the low ionization lines (LIL) in active galactic nuclei still faces problems in explaining
the observed equivalent widths (EWs). We examine the optical Fe II and near-infrared Ca II triplet
(CaT) emission strengths using the photoionization code CLOUDY. Using an incident continuum for
I Zw 1 - a prototypical Type-1 narrow-line Seyfert galaxy, we can recover the line ratios for the optical
Fe II (i.e. R$_{\rm{Fe II}}$) and the NIR CaT (i.e. R$_{\rm{CaT}}$) in agreement to the observed
estimates. Although, the pairs of (U,$\rm{n_{H}}$) that reproduce the conforming line ratios,
unfortunately, do not relate to agreeable line EWs. We thus propose that the LIL region of the BLR
cloud doesn't see the same continuum seen by a distant observer that is emanated from the accretion
disk, rather it sees a filtered version of the original continuum. The assumption of the filtered
continuum as the source of BLR irradiation recovers realistic EWs for LIL species. However, our
study finds that to account for the adequate R$_{\rm{Fe II}}$ (Fe II/H$\beta$ flux ratio) emission,
the BLR needs to be selectively overabundant in iron. On the other hand, the R$_{\rm{CaT}}$ (CaT/H$\beta$
flux ratio) emission spans a broader range from solar to super-solar metallicities. In all these
models the BLR cloud density is found to be consistent with our conclusions from prior works, i.e.
$\rm{n_{H}} \sim 10^{12}$ cm$^{-3}$. An interesting result obtained here is the reduction in the
value of the metallicity by up to a factor 10 for the R$_{\rm{Fe II}}$ cases when the microturbulence
is invoked, suggesting that microturbulence can act as an apparent metallicity controller for
the Fe II. On the contrary, the R$_{\rm{CaT}}$ cases are rather unaffected by the effect of microturbulence.

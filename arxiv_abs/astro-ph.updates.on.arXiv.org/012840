We propose that fourteen co-moving groups of stars uncovered by Kounkel & Covey (2019) may be related
to known nearby moving groups and bridge those and nearby open clusters with similar ages and space
velocities. This indicates that known nearby moving groups may be spatially much more extended
than previously though, and some of them might be parts of tidal tails around the cores of known open
clusters, reminiscent of those recently found around the Hyades and a handful of other nearby clusters.
For example, we find that both the nearby Carina and Columba associations may be linked to Theia 208
from Kounkel & Covey (2019) and together form parts of a large tidal tail around the Platais 8 open
cluster. The AB Doradus moving group and Theia 301 may form a trailing tidal tail behind the Pleiades
open cluster, with hints of a possible leading tidal tail in Theia 369. We similarly find that IC 2391
and its tidal tails identified by Meingast et al. (2021) may be extended by the nearby Argus association
and are possibly further extended by Theia 115. The nearby Octans and Octans-Near associations,
as well as Theia 94 and 95, may form a large tidal tail leading the poorly studied Platais 5 open cluster
candidate. While a preliminary analysis of Gaia color-magnitude sequences hint that these structures
are plausibly related, more observational evidence is still required to corroborate their consistent
ages and space velocities. These observations may change our current understanding of nearby moving
groups and the different pathways through which they can form. While some moving groups may have
formed loosely in extended star-formation events with rich spatial structure, others may in fact
correspond to the tidal tails of nearby open clusters.

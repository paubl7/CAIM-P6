We present the kinematics and stellar population properties of a sample of 53 galaxies (50 are Early-Type
galaxies, ETGs) with Counter-Rotating Disks (CRD) extracted from a sample of about 4000 galaxies
of all morphological types in the MaNGA survey (DR16). The kinematic maps were used to select galaxies
based on evidence of counter-rotation in the velocity maps or two peaks in the velocity dispersion
maps. For about 1/3 of the sample, the counter-rotating components can also be separated spectroscopically.
We then produced the age and metallicity maps, and compared the stellar population properties to
those of the general ETGs population. We found that CRDs have similar trends in age and metallicity,
but they are generally less metallic at low masses. The metallicity gradients are similar; instead,
age gradients are typically flatter and confined within a smaller range of values. We compared the
velocity fields of the ionized gas and the stars, and found that in 25 cases the gas corotates with
either the inner (13 cases) or the outer (12 cases) disk, and in 9 cases the gaseous and stellar disks
are misaligned. With one exception, all misaligned cases have stellar masses less than $3 \times
10^{10}$M$_\odot$. We also compared stellar and gaseous disks with age maps and found that in most
cases the gas corotates with the younger disk. We looked for evidences of multimodality in the stellar
populations, and found it in 25 galaxies, plus 11 cases with evidences of ongoing star formation,
and the latter are the youngest and least massive galaxies; 13 galaxies, instead, exhibit unimodality,
and are the oldest and most massive CRDs. As a general result, our work supports different formation
scenarios for the kinematic class of counter-rotators.

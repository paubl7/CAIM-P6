Aims: We investigate the orbital and phase space properties of loss cone stars that interact strongly
with a hard, high-redshift binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) system formed in a cosmological
scenario. Methods: We utilize a novel hybrid integration approach that combines the direct N-body
code $\varphi$-GRAPE, with ETICS, a collisionless code that employs the self-consistent field
integration method. The hybrid approach shows considerable speed-up over direct summation for
particle numbers $> 10^6$, while retaining accuracy of direct N-body for a subset of particles.
During the SMBH binary evolution we monitor individual stellar interactions with the binary in
order to identify stars that noticeably contribute to the SMBH binary hardening. Results: We successfully
identify and analyze in detail the properties of stars which extract energy from the binary. We identify
stars on centrophilic orbits that repopulate the loss cone and estimate that $76\%$ of the centrophilic
orbits are possible only in a triaxial system. We distinguish three different populations of interactions,
based on their apocenter and investigate their contribution to the SMBH binary hardening. We find
a clear prevalence of interactions co-rotating with the binary. While smaller in number, retrograde
interactions are the most energetic, contributing only slightly less than the prograde population
to the overall energy exchange. The most energetic interactions are also likely to result in a sign-flip
change in the angular momentum of the star. We show that even slight triaxiality results in a roughly
constant hardening rate of the binary, avoiding the Final Parsec Problem. We estimate the merger
timescale of the binary to be $\approx 20$ $\mathrm{Myr}$, a value larger by a factor of two than the
timescale reported in a previous study.

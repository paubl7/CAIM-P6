Line profile distortions are commonly observed in gravitationally lensed quasar spectra. These
distortions are caused by microlensing from the stars in the lensing galaxy, which produce differential
magnification of spatially and kinematically separated parts of the broad line region (BLR). The
quasi-simultaneous visible and near-infrared spectroscopy of the lensed quasar Q2237+0305 reveals
strong microlensing-induced line deformations in the high-ionization CIV $\lambda$ 1549 \AA
and the low-ionization H$\alpha$ emission lines. We use this effect to constrain the BLR size, geometry,
and kinematics in Q2237+0305. For this purpose, we modeled the deformation of the emission lines
for three representative BLR models: a Keplerian disk, an equatorial wind, and a biconical polar
wind. We considered various inclinations with respect to the line of sight. We find that the observed
microlensing effect, characterized by a set of four indices, can only be reproduced by a subsample
of the considered BLR models. The microlensing analysis favors a Keplerian disk model for the regions
emitting the CIV and the H$\alpha$ emission lines. A polar wind model remains possible for the CIV
BLR, although it is less likely. The equatorial wind model is totally excluded. A preferred inclination
of the BLR of 40$\deg$ is found, in agreement with expectations for a type 1 AGN and past constraints
on the accretion disk inclination. The half-light radius of the BLR is $ r_{\rm 1/2} \simeq$ 47$\pm$19
light-days, with no significant difference between the CIV and H$\alpha$ BLRs. The size of the CIV
BLR agrees with the radius-luminosity relation derived from reverberation mapping, while the
size of the Balmer line BLR is one order of magnitude smaller, possibly revealing different quasar
properties at high luminosities and high accretion rates.

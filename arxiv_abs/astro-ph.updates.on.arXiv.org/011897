(ABRIDGED) Disentangling line-of-sight alignments of young stellar populations is crucial for
observational studies of star-forming complexes. This task is particularly problematic in a Cygnus-X
subregion where several components, located at different distances, are overlapped: the Berkeley
87 young massive cluster, the poorly-known [DB2001] Cl05 embedded cluster, and the ON2 star-forming
complex, in turn composed of several HII regions. We aim at providing a methodology for building
an exhaustive census of young objects that can consistently deal with large differences in both
extinction and distance. OMEGA2000 near-infrared observations of the Berkeley 87 / ON2 field are
merged with archival data from Gaia, Chandra, Spitzer, and Herschel, as well as cross-identifications
from the literature. To address the incompleteness effects and selection biases that arise from
the line-of-sight overlap, we adapt existing methods for extinction estimation and young object
classification, and we define the intrinsic reddening index, $R_\mathrm{int}$, a new tool to separate
intrinsically red sources from those whose infrared color excess is caused by extinction. We also
introduce a new method to find young stellar objects based on $R_\mathrm{int}$. The flexibility
of our approach allows to overcome photometric biases in order to obtain homogeneous catalogs of
young sources. As a result, we find 571 objects whose classification is related to recent or ongoing
star formation. Together with other point sources with individual estimates of distance or extinction,
we compile a catalog of 3005 objects to be used for further membership work. A new distance for Berkeley
87, ($1673 \pm 17$) pc, is estimated as a median of 13 spectroscopic members with accurate Gaia EDR3
parallaxes. Our multi-wavelength census will serve as a basis for disentangling the overlapped
populations.

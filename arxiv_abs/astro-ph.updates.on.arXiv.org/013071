Recent advances in techniques of critical close reading of historical texts can now be applied to
records of pre-telescopic celestial observations - allowing significant progress for analyzing
and solving orbits of past comets: we exemplify our method by solving the orbit of the comet in AD 760
only with historical observations and then identify it with 1P/Halley. A detailed eyewitness record
with drawing of a comet in AD 760 in the Syriac Chronicle of Zuqnin (finished AD 775/6) was not yet included
in the study of its orbit - the Chinese reports alone do not yield a sufficient number of dated positions.
We analyze the Syriac and Chinese sources with critical methods for quantitative astronomical
usage, we also consider a few further records from the Mediterranean and West Asian area. With our
conservatively derived dated positions we can determine the best fitting Keplerian orbital solution
by least squares fitting yielding the orbital elements; the parameter ranges for non-periodic
solutions and highly eccentric periodic solutions are consistent with each other. The allowed
parameter ranges for perihelion distance and inclination are sufficiently small to identify the
comet with 1P/Halley. Although 1P/Halley is the only comet, where the telescopic orbit is credibly
linked to pre-telescopic returns, e.g. to AD 760, our identification confirms claims from extrapolating
telescopic observations backward in time - here independently based on historical data. In particular,
we obtained a precise perihelion time (760 May 19.1 \pm 1.7). The inferior conjunction between comet
and Sun as on the previously published orbit (760 May 31.9) is shifted by about one day compared to
our new orbit (June 1.8), only the new one is consistent with the last observation (June 1.0) before
conjunction as reported in the Chronicle of Zuqnin. We also study the comet's brightness evolution

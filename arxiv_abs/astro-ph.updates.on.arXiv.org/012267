We present results from a suite of binary merging cluster simulations. The hydrodynamical cluster
simulations are performed employing a smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) formulation in which
gradients are strongly reduced by means of an integral approach. We consider adiabatic as well as
radiative simulations, in which we include gas cooling, star formation and energy feedback from
supernovae. We explore the effects of merging on the thermodynamic structure of the intracluster
gas of the final merger remnant. In particular, we study how core entropy is generated during the
merging and the stability properties of the initial cool-core profile against disruption. To this
end, we consider a range of initial mass ratio and impact parameters. Final entropy profiles of our
adiabatic merging simulations are in good accord with previous findings (ZuHone 2011), with cool-cores
being disrupted for all of the initial merging setups. For equal-mass off-axis mergers, we find
that a significant contribution to the final primary core entropy is due to hydrodynamic instabilities
generated by rotational motions, which are induced by tidal torques during the first pericenter
passage. In radiative simulations, cool-cores are more resilient against heating processes;
nonetheless, they are able to maintain their integrity only in the case of off-axis mergers with
very unequal masses. We suggest that these results are robust against changes in the gas physical
modeling, in particular to the inclusion of AGN thermal feedback. Our findings support the view
that the observed core cluster morphology emerges naturally in a merging cluster context, and conclude
that the merging angular momentum is a key parameter in shaping the thermodynamical properties
of the final merger remnant.

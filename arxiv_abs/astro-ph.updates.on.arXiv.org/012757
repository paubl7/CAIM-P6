V838 Mon erupted in 2002 quickly becoming the prototype of a new type of stellar eruptions known today
as (luminous) red novae. The red nova outbursts are thought to be caused by stellar mergers. The merger
in V838 Mon took place in a triple or higher system involving two B-type stars. We mapped the merger
site with ALMA at a resolution of 25 mas in continuum dust emission and in rotational lines of simple
molecules, including CO, SiO, SO, SO$_2$, AlOH, and H$_2$S. We use radiative transfer calculations
to reproduce the remnant's architecture at the epoch of the ALMA observations. For the first time,
we identify the position of the B-type companion relative to the outbursting component of V838 Mon.
The stellar remnant is surrounded by a clumpy wind with characteristics similar to winds of red supergiants.
The merger product is also associated with an elongated structure, $17.6 \times 7.6$ mas, seen in
continuum emission, and which we interpret as a disk seen at a moderate inclination. Maps of continuum
and molecular emission show also a complex region of interaction between the B-type star (its gravity,
radiation, and wind) and the flow of matter ejected in 2002. The remnant's molecular mass is about
0.1 M$_{\odot}$ and the dust mass is 8.3$\cdot$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$. The mass of the atomic component
remains unconstrained. The most interesting region for understanding the merger of V838 Mon remains
unresolved but appears elongated. To study it further in more detail will require even higher angular
resolutions. ALMA maps show us an extreme form of interaction between the merger ejecta with a distant
(250 au) companion. This interaction is similar to that known from the Antares AB system but at a much
higher mass loss rate. The B-type star not only deflects the merger ejecta but also changes its chemical
composition with an involvement of circumstellar shocks.

In present paper, we describe a theoretical model of generation of harmonic emissions of type III
solar radio bursts. The goal of our study is to fully take into account the most efficient physical
processes participating in generation of harmonic electromagnetic emission via nonlinear coupling
of Langmuir waves in randomly inhomogeneous plasma of solar wind ($l+l^{'} \rightarrow t$). We
revisit the conventional mechanism of coalescence of primarily generated and back-scattered
Langmuir waves in quasihomogeneous plasma. Additionally, we propose and investigate another
mechanism that generates the harmonic emission only in a strongly inhomogeneous plasma: the nonlinear
coupling of incident and reflected Langmuir waves inside localized regions with enhanced plasma
density (clumps), in the close vicinity of the reflection point. Both mechanisms imply the presence
of strong density fluctuations in plasma. We use the results of a probabilistic model of beam-plasma
interaction and evaluate the efficiency of energy transfer from Langmuir waves to harmonic emission.
We infer that harmonic emissions from a quasihomogeneous plasma are significantly more intense
than found in previous studies. The efficiency of Langmuir waves conversion into electromagnetic
harmonic emission is expected to be higher at large heliospheric distances for the mechanism operating
in quasihomogeneous plasma, and at small heliocentric distances - for the one operating in inhomogeneous.
The evaluation of emission intensity in quasihomogeneous plasma may also be applied for type II
solar radio bursts. The radiation pattern in both cases is quadrupolar, and we show that emission
from density clumps may efficiently contribute to the visibility of harmonic radio emission.

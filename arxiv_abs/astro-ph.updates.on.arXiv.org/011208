Polarimetry is about to become a powerful tool for determining the atmospheric properties of exoplanets.
To provide the basis for the interpretation of observational results and for predictive studies
to guide future observations, sophisticated analysis tools are required. Our goal is to develop
a radiative transfer tool that contains all the relevant continuum polarization mechanisms for
the comprehensive analysis of the polarized flux resulting from the scattering in the atmosphere
of, on the surface of, and in the local planetary environment (e.g., planetary rings, exomoons)
of extra-solar planets. Furthermore, our goal is to avoid common simplifications such as locally
plane-parallel planetary atmospheres, the missing cross-talk between latitudinal and longitudinal
regions, or the assumption of either a point-like star or plane-parallel illumination. As a platform
for the newly developed numerical algorithms, we use the 3D Monte Carlo radiative transfer code
POLARIS. The code is extended and optimized for the radiative transfer in exoplanetary atmospheres.
We investigate the reflected flux and its degree of polarization for different phase angles for
a homogeneous cloud-free atmosphere and an inhomogeneous cloudy atmosphere. To take advantage
of the 3D radiative transfer and to demonstrate the potential of the code, the impact of an additional
circumplanetary ring on the reflected polarized flux is studied. The presence of a circumplanetary
ring consisting of small water-ice particles has a noticeable impact on the reflected polarized
radiation. In particular, the reflected flux strongly increases at larger phase angles if the planetary
orbit is seen edge-on because the considered particles tend to scatter forwards. In contrast, the
degree of polarization decreases at these phase angles.

High-speed downflows have been observed in the solar transition region (TR) and lower corona for
many decades. Despite their abundance, it has been hard to find signatures of such downflows in the
solar chromosphere. In this work, we target an enhanced network region that shows ample occurrences
of rapid spicular downflows in the \halpha\ spectral line that could potentially be linked to high-speed
TR downflowing counterparts. We used the $k$-means algorithm to classify the spectral profiles
of on-disk spicules in \halpha{} and \cak{} data observed from the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST)
and employed an automated detection method based on advanced morphological image processing operations
to detect such downflowing features, in conjunction with rapid blue-shifted and red-shifted excursions
(RBEs and RREs). We report the existence of a new category of RREs (termed as downflowing RRE) for
the first time that, contrary to earlier interpretation, are associated with chromospheric field-aligned
downflows moving towards the strong magnetic field regions. Statistical analysis performed on
nearly 20,000 RBEs and 15,000 RREs (including the downflowing counterparts), detected in our 97~min
long dataset, shows that the downflowing RREs are very similar to RBEs and RREs except for their oppositely
directed plane-of-sky motion. Furthermore, we also find that RBEs, RREs and downflowing RREs can
be represented by a wide range of spectral profiles with varying Doppler offsets, and \halpha{}
line core widths, both along and perpendicular to the spicule axis, that causes them to be associated
with multiple substructures that evolve together. We speculate that these rapid plasma downflows
could well be the chromospheric counterparts of the commonly observed TR downflows.

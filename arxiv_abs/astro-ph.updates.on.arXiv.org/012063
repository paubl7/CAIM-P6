Research for possible biosignature gases on habitable exoplanet atmosphere is accelerating.
We add isoprene, C5H8, to the roster of biosignature gases. We found that formation of isoprene geochemical
formation is highly thermodynamically disfavored and has no known abiotic false positives. The
isoprene production rate on Earth rivals that of methane (~ 500 Tg yr-1). On Earth, isoprene is rapidly
destroyed by oxygen-containing radicals, but its production is ubiquitous to a diverse array of
evolutionarily distant organisms, from bacteria to plants and animals-few, if any at all, volatile
secondary metabolite has a larger evolutionary reach. While non-photochemical sinks of isoprene
may exist, the destruction of isoprene in an anoxic atmosphere is mainly driven by photochemistry.
Motivated by the concept that isoprene might accumulate in anoxic environments, we model the photochemistry
and spectroscopic detection of isoprene in habitable temperature, rocky exoplanet anoxic atmospheres
with a variety of atmosphere compositions under different host star UV fluxes. Limited by an assumed
10 ppm instrument noise floor, habitable atmosphere characterization using JWST is only achievable
with transit signal similar or larger than that for a super-Earth sized exoplanet transiting an
M dwarf star with an H2-dominated atmosphere. Unfortunately, isoprene cannot accumulate to detectable
abundance without entering a run-away phase, which occurs at a very high production rate, ~ 100 times
Earth's production rate. In this run-away scenario isoprene will accumulate to > 100 ppm and its
spectral features are detectable with ~ 20 JWST transits. One caveat is that some spectral features
are hard to be distinguished from that of methane. Despite these challenges, isoprene is worth adding
to the menu of potential biosignature gases.

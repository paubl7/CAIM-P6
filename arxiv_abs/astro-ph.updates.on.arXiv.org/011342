LS~5039 is a powerful gamma-ray binary that probably hosts a non-accreting pulsar. Despite the
wealth of data available, the power source of the non-thermal emitter is still unknown. We use a dynamical-radiative
numerical model and multiwavelength data to constrain the properties of a pulsar wind that may power
the non-thermal emitter in LS~5039. We ran simulations of an ultrarelativistic (low-$B$) cold
$e^\pm$-wind that Compton scatters stellar photons and that dynamically interacts with the stellar
wind. The effects of energy losses on the unshocked $e^\pm$-wind dynamics, and the geometry of the
two-wind contact discontinuity, are computed for different wind models. The predicted unshocked
$e^\pm$-wind radiation at periastron, when expected to be highest, is compared to LS~5039 data.
The minimum possible radiation from an isotropic cold $e^\pm$-wind overpredicts the X-ray to gamma-ray
fluxes at periastron by a factor of $\sim 3$. In the anisotropic wind case X-ray and $\gtrsim 100$
MeV data are not violated by wind radiation if the wind axis is at $\lesssim 20-40^\circ$ from the
line of sight (probability of $\lesssim 6-24$\%), depending on the anisotropic wind model, or if
the wind Lorentz factor $\in 10^2-10^3$, in which case the wind power can be higher, but it requires
$e^\pm$-multiplicities of $\sim 10^6$ and $10^9$ for a $10^{-2}$~s and 10~s pulsar period, respectively.
The studied model predicts that a low-$B$ cold pulsar $e^\pm$-wind in LS~5039 should be strongly
anisotropic, with either a wind Lorentz factor $\in 10^2-10^3$ and very high multiplicities or
with a fine-tuned wind orientation. A low-$B$, cold baryon-dominated wind would be possible, but
then the multiplicities should be rather low, while the baryon-to-$e^\pm$ energy transfer should
be very efficient at wind termination. A strongly magnetized cold wind seems to be the most favorable
(least constrained) option.

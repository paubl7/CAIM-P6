[Abridged] Context: We present a systematic X-ray spectral-timing study of the recently discovered,
exceptionally bright black hole X-ray binary system MAXI J1820+070. Our analysis focuses on the
first part of the 2018 outburst, covering the rise throughout the hard state, the bright hard and
hard-intermediate states, and the transition to the soft-intermediate state. Aims: We address
the issue of constraining the geometry of the innermost accretion flow and its evolution throughout
an outburst. Methods: We employed two independent X-ray spectral-timing methods applied to the
NICER data of MAXI J1820+070. We first identified and tracked the evolution of a characteristic
frequency of soft X-ray reverberation lags. Then, we studied the spectral evolution of the quasi-thermal
component responsible for the observed thermal reverberation lags. Results: The frequency of
thermal reverberation lags steadily increases throughout most of the outburst, implying that
the relative distance between the X-ray source and the disc decreases as the source softens. However,
near transition this evolution breaks, showing a sudden increase (decrease) of lag amplitude (frequency).
The evolution of the quasi-thermal component in high-frequency covariance spectra is consistent
with a steady decrease of the inner radius of the disc as the source softens. Conclusions: The behaviour
of thermal reverberation lags near transition might be related to relativistic plasma ejections
detected at radio wavelengths later in the outburst, possibly representing the precursor to such
events. Throughout most of the hard and hard-intermediate states the disc is consistent with being
truncated (with an inner radius $R_{\rm in}>\sim 10 R_{\rm g}$), reaching close to the innermost
stable circular orbit only near transition.

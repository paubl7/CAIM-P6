LiteBIRD has been selected as JAXA's strategic large mission in the 2020s, to observe the cosmic
microwave background (CMB) $B$-mode polarization over the full sky at large angular scales. The
challenges of LiteBIRD are the wide field-of-view (FoV) and broadband capabilities of millimeter-wave
polarization measurements, which are derived from the system requirements. The possible paths
of stray light increase with a wider FoV and the far sidelobe knowledge of $-56$ dB is a challenging
optical requirement. A crossed-Dragone configuration was chosen for the low frequency telescope
(LFT : 34--161 GHz), one of LiteBIRD's onboard telescopes. It has a wide field-of-view ($18^\circ
\times 9^\circ$) with an aperture of 400 mm in diameter, corresponding to an angular resolution
of about 30 arcminutes around 100 GHz. The focal ratio f/3.0 and the crossing angle of the optical
axes of 90$^\circ$ are chosen after an extensive study of the stray light. The primary and secondary
reflectors have rectangular shapes with serrations to reduce the diffraction pattern from the
edges of the mirrors. The reflectors and structure are made of aluminum to proportionally contract
from warm down to the operating temperature at $5\,$K. A 1/4 scaled model of the LFT has been developed
to validate the wide field-of-view design and to demonstrate the reduced far sidelobes. A polarization
modulation unit (PMU), realized with a half-wave plate (HWP) is placed in front of the aperture stop,
the entrance pupil of this system. A large focal plane with approximately 1000 AlMn TES detectors
and frequency multiplexing SQUID amplifiers is cooled to 100 mK. The lens and sinuous antennas have
broadband capability. Performance specifications of the LFT and an outline of the proposed verification
plan are presented.

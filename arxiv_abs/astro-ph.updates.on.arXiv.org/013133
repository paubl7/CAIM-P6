We investigate the application of Hybrid Effective Field Theory (HEFT) -- which combines a Lagrangian
bias expansion with subsequent particle dynamics from $N$-body simulations -- to the modeling
of $k$-Nearest Neighbor Cumulative Distribution Functions ($k{\rm NN}$-${\rm CDF}$s) of biased
tracers of the cosmological matter field. The $k{\rm NN}$-${\rm CDF}$s are sensitive to all higher
order connected $N$-point functions in the data, but are computationally cheap to compute. We develop
the formalism to predict the $k{\rm NN}$-${\rm CDF}$s of discrete tracers of a continuous field
from the statistics of the continuous field itself. Using this formalism, we demonstrate how $k{\rm
NN}$-${\rm CDF}$ statistics of a set of biased tracers, such as halos or galaxies, of the cosmological
matter field can be modeled given a set of low-redshift HEFT component fields and bias parameter
values. These are the same ingredients needed to predict the two-point clustering. For a specific
sample of halos, we show that both the two-point clustering \textit{and} the $k{\rm NN}$-${\rm
CDF}$s can be well-fit on quasi-linear scales ($\gtrsim 20 h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$) by the second-order
HEFT formalism with the \textit{same values} of the bias parameters, implying that joint modeling
of the two is possible. Finally, using a Fisher matrix analysis, we show that including $k{\rm NN}$-${\rm
CDF}$ measurements over the range of allowed scales in the HEFT framework can improve the constraints
on $\sigma_8$ by roughly a factor of $3$, compared to the case where only two-point measurements
are considered. Combining the statistical power of $k{\rm NN}$ measurements with the modeling
power of HEFT, therefore, represents an exciting prospect for extracting greater information
from small-scale cosmological clustering.

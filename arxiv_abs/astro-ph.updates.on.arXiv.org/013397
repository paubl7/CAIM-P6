Classical Cepheids (DCEPs) are the most important primary indicators of the extragalactic distance
scale. Establishing the dependence on metallicity of their period--luminosity and period--Wesenheit
($PLZ$/$PWZ$) relations has deep consequences on the calibration of secondary distance indicators
that lead to the final estimate of the Hubble constant (H$_0$). We collected high-resolution spectroscopy
for 47 DCEPs plus 1 BL Her variables with HARPS-N@TNG and derived accurate atmospheric parameters,
radial velocities and metal abundances. We measured spectral lines for 29 species and characterized
their chemical abundances, finding very good agreement with previous results. We re-determined
the ephemerides for the program stars and measured their intensity-averaged magnitudes in the
$V,I,J,H,K_s$ bands. We complemented our sample with literature data and used the Gaia Early Data
Release 3 (EDR3) to investigate the $PLZ$/$PWZ$ relations for Galactic DCEPs in a variety of filter
combinations. We find that the solution without any metallicity term is ruled out at more than the
5 $\sigma$ level. Our best estimate for the metallicity dependence of the intercept of the $PLK_s$,
$PWJK_s$, $PWVK_s$ and $PWHVI$ relations with three parameters, is $-0.456\pm$0.099, $-0.465\pm$0.071,
$-0.459\pm$0.107 and $-0.366\pm$0.089 mag/dex, respectively. These values are significantly
larger than the recent literature. The present data are still inconclusive to establish whether
or not also the slope of the relevant relationships depends on metallicity. Applying a correction
to the standard zero point offset of the Gaia parallaxes has the same effect of reducing by $\sim$22\%
the size of the metallicity dependence on the intercept of the PLZ/PWZ relations.

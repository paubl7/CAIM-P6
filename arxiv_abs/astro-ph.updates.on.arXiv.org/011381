Four observations of Starlink's LEO communication satellites, Darksat and STARLINK-1113, were
conducted on two nights with two telescopes. The Chakana 0.6\,m telescope at the Ckoirama observatory
(Chile) observed both satellites on 5\,Mar\,2020 (UTC) and 7\,Mar\,2020 (UTC) using a Sloan r'
and Sloan i' filter, respectively. The ESO VISTA 4.1\,m telescope with the VIRCAM instrument observed
both satellites on 5\,Mar\,2020 (UTC) and 7\,Mar\,2020 (UTC) in the NIR J-band and Ks-band, respectively.
The calibration, image processing, and analysis of the Darksat images give r\,$\approx$\,5.6\,mag,
i\,$\approx$\,5.0\,mag, J\,$\approx$\,4.2\,mag, and Ks\,$\approx$\,4.0\,mag when scaled
to a range of 550\,km (airmass $=1$) and corrected for the solar incidence and observer phase angles.
In comparison, the STARLINK-1113 images give r\,$\approx$\,4.9\,mag, i\,$\approx$\,4.4\,mag,
J\,$\approx$\,3.8\,mag, and Ks\,$\approx$\,3.6\,mag when corrected for range, solar incidence,
and observer phase angles. The data and results presented in this work show that the special darkening
coating used by Starlink for Darksat has darkened the Sloan r' magnitude by 50\,\%, Sloan i' magnitude
by 42\,\%, NIR J magnitude by 32\,\%, and NIR Ks magnitude by 28\,\%. The results show that both satellites
increase in reflective brightness with increasing wavelength and that the effectiveness of the
darkening treatment is reduced at longer wavelengths. This shows that the mitigation strategies
being developed by Starlink and other LEO satellite operators need to take into account other wavelengths,
not just the optical. This work highlights the continued importance of obtaining multi-wavelength
observations of many different LEO satellites in order to characterise their reflective properties
and to aid the community in developing impact simulations and developing mitigation tools.

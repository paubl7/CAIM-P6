Enhancing interoperable data access to radio data has become a science priority within the International
Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA). This lead to the foundation of the IVOA Radio astronomy Interest
Group. Several radio astronomers and project scientists enrolled in various projects (NRAO, ASKAP,
LOFAR, JIVE, ALMA, SKA, INAF, NenuFAR, etc.) have joined. Together they are paving the way to a better
integration of their services in the virtual observatory (VO) infrastructure and propose extension
of IVOA standards to help achieving this goal. Calibrated radio datasets such as cubes, images,
spectra and time series can already be searched and retrieved using the ObsCore/ObsTAP specification
defined in the IVOA, or by data product-specific services like SIAv2, SODA, SSA and ConeSearch.
However, properties of radio visibility data are not fully implemented in the VO landscape yet.
We need specific features to refine data discovery and selection that are adapted to radio astronomers'
need. In this context the VO team at the Centre de Donn\'{e}es astronomiques de Strasbourg (CDS)
proposes to consider the ObsCore/ObsTAP specification and to establish cross-walks between the
ObsCore and the existing Measurement Set (MS) metadata profile for data discovery of radio visibility
data (VD). In order to account for the difference in granularity between radio VD datasets and science-ready
datasets of the VO, the approach splits a MS data file into a list of datasets served by an ObsTAP service,
thus enabling coarse grain discovery in the multi-wavelength context. Radio specific metadata
such as number of antennae, frequency ranges, $uv$ plane coverage plots, frequency-phase and frequency-amplitude
plots, primary and synthesized beams are also provided either by adding column metadata or by using
the DataLink technique.

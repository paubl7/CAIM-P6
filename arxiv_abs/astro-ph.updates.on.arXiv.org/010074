Asteroid Impacts pose a major threat to all life on the Earth. Deflecting the asteroid from the impact
trajectory is an important way to mitigate the threat. A kinetic impactor remains to be the most feasible
method to deflect the asteroid. However, due to the constraint of the launch capability, an impactor
with the limited mass can only produce a very limited amount of velocity increment for the asteroid.
In order to improve the deflection efficiency of the kinetic impactor strategy, this paper proposed
a new concept called the Assembled Kinetic Impactor (AKI), which is combining the spacecraft with
the launch vehicle final stage. By making full use of the mass of the launch vehicle final stage, the
mass of the impactor will be increased, which will cause the improvement of the deflection efficiency.
According to the technical data of Long March 5 (CZ-5) launch vehicle, the missions of deflecting
Bennu are designed to demonstrate the power of the AKI concept. Simulation results show that, compared
with the Classic Kinetic Impactor (CKI, performs spacecraft-rocket separation), the addition
of the mass of the launch vehicle final stage can increase the deflection distance to more than 3 times,
and reduce the launch lead-time by at least 15 years. With the requirement of the same deflection
distance, the addition of the mass of the launch vehicle final stage can reduce the number of launches
to 1/3 of that of the number of CKI launches. The AKI concept makes it possible to defend Bennu-like
large asteroids by a no-nuclear technique within 10-year launch lead-time. At the same time, for
a single CZ-5, the deflection distance of a 140 m diameter asteroid within 10-year launch lead-time,
can be increased from less than 1 Earth radii to more than 1 Earth radii.

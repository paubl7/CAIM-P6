Context: In spiral galaxies, star formation tends to trace features of the spiral pattern, including
arms, spurs, feathers, and branches. However, in our own Milky Way, it has been challenging to connect
individual star-forming regions to their larger Galactic environment owing to our perspective
from within the disk. One feature in nearly all modern models of the Milky Way is the Sagittarius Arm,
located inward of the Sun with a pitch angle of ~12 deg. Aims: We map the 3D locations and velocities
of star-forming regions in a segment of the Sagittarius Arm using young stellar objects (YSOs) from
the Spitzer/IRAC Candidate YSO (SPICY) catalog to compare their distribution to models of the arm.
Methods: Distances and velocities for these objects are derived from Gaia EDR3 astrometry and molecular
line surveys. We infer parallaxes and proper motions for spatially clustered groups of YSOs and
estimate their radial velocities from the velocities of spatially associated molecular clouds.
Results: We identify 25 star-forming regions in the Galactic longitude range l~4.0-18.5 deg arranged
in a narrow, ~1 kpc long linear structure with a high pitch angle of $\psi = 56$ deg and a high aspect
ratio of ~7:1. This structure includes massive star-forming regions such as M8, M16, M17, and M20.
The motions in the structure are remarkably coherent, with velocities in the direction of Galactic
rotation of $240\pm3$ km/s (slightly higher than average) and slight drifts toward the Galactic
center (-4.3 km/s) and in the negative Z direction (-2.9 km/s). The rotational shear experienced
by the structure is 4.6 km/s/kpc. Conclusions: The observed 56 deg pitch angle is remarkably high
for a segment of the Sagittarius Arm. We discuss possible interpretations of this feature as a substructure
within the lower pitch angle Sagittarius Arm, as a spur, or as an isolated structure.

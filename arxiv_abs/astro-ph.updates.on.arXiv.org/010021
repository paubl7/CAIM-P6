We report the discovery of unusual broad absorption lines (BALs) in the bright quasar SDSS J075133.35+134548.3
at z~1, and present a detailed study of BAL and emission lines using the archived and newly obtained
optical and NIR spectroscopic data. The BALs are detected tentatively in Mg II, Al III and reliably
in HeI*3889, HeI*10830, which show complexed velocity structures splitting into two components:
a high-velocity component (HV), with a blueshifted velocity range of -9300 ~ -3500 km/s, can be reliably
detected tentatively in Mg II, Al III and reliably in HeI* 10830, whereas it is undetectable in HeI*
3889; and low-Velocity component (LV), with the velocity of -3500 ~ -1800 km/s, is only detected
in HeI*3889 and HeI* 10830. With the BALs from different ions, the HV outflowing gas can be constrained
to have a density n_H~10^10.3-10^11.4 cm^-3, a column density N_H~10^21 cm^-2 and an ionization
parameter U~10^-1.83 - 10^-1.72; and thus inferring a distance of R_HV~0.5 pc from the central continuum
source with a monochromatic luminosity of 7.0*10^45 erg/s at 5100 A. This distance is remarkable
similar to that of normal broad emission line region (BLR) estimated according to the luminosity-distance
from the reverberation experiments, suggesting the association between the BLR and the HV BAL outflowing
gas. Interestingly enough, a blueshifted component is also significantly detected in Mg II and
Al III broad emission lines (BELs), and the Al III/Mg II of such a BEL component can be reproduced by
the physical parameters inferred from the HV BAL gas. The LV BAL gas very likely have a larger column
density and a higher ionization level than the HV BAL gas, and hence a smaller distance than that of
the latter. Further spectroscopy with high S/N ratio and broader wavelength coverage is needed
to confirm this and shed new light on the possible connection between BALs and BELs.

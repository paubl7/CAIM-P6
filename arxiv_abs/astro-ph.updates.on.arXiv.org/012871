Teleparallel gravity has significantly increased in popularity in recent decades, bringing attention
to Einstein's other theory of gravity. In this Review, we relate this form of geometry to the broader
metric-affine approach to forming gravitational theories where we describe a systematic way of
constructing consistent teleparallel theories that respect certain physical conditions such
as local Lorentz invariance. We first use teleparallel gravity to formulate a teleparallel equivalent
of general relativity which is dynamically equivalent to general relativity but which may have
different behaviors for other scenarios, such as quantum gravity. After setting this foundation,
we describe the plethora of modified teleparallel theories of gravity that have been proposed in
the literature. In the second part of the Review, we first survey works in teleparallel astrophysics
literature where we focus on the open questions in this regime of physics. We then discuss the cosmological
consequences for the various formulations of teleparallel gravity. We do this at background level
by exploring works using various approaches ranging from dynamical systems to Noether symmetries,
and more. Naturally, we then discuss perturbation theory, firstly by giving a concise approach
in which this can be applied in teleparallel gravity theories and then apply it to a number of important
theories in the literature. Finally, we examine works in observational and precision cosmology
across the plethora of proposal theories. This is done using some of the latest observations and
is used to tackle cosmological tensions which may be alleviated in teleparallel cosmology. We also
introduce a number of recent works in the application of machine learning to gravity, we do this through
deep learning and Gaussian processes, together with discussions about other approaches in the
literature.

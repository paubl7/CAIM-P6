[abridged] Recent laboratory experiments indicate that destructive collisions of icy dust particles
occur with much lower velocities than previously thought. When these new velocities are considered
from laboratory experiments in dust evolution models, a growth to pebble sizes in protoplanetary
disks (PPDs) is difficult. This may contradict (sub-)mm observations and challenge the formation
of planetesimals and planets. We investigate the conditions that are required in dust evolution
models for growing and trapping pebbles in PPDs when the fragmentation speed is 1ms$^{-1}$ in the
entire disk. We distinguish the parameters controlling the effects of turbulent velocities, vertical
stirring, radial diffusion, and gas viscous evolution, always assuming that particles cannot
diffuse faster (radially or vertically) than the gas. To form pebbles and produce effective particle
trapping, the parameter that controls the particle turbulent velocities must be small ($\delta_t\lesssim10^{-4}$).
In these cases, the vertical settling can limit the formation of pebbles, which also prevents particle
trapping. Therefore the parameter that sets the vertical settling of the grains must be $\delta_z<10^{-3}$.
Our results suggest that different combinations of the particle and gas diffusion parameters can
lead to a large diversity of millimeter fluxes and dust-disk radii. When pebble formation occurs
and trapping is efficient, gaps and rings have higher contrast at mm-emission than in the NIR. In
the case of inefficient trapping, structures are also formed at the two wavelengths, producing
deeper and wider gaps in the NIR. Our results highlight the importance of obtaining observational
constraints of gas and particle diffusion parameters and the properties of gaps at short and long
wavelengths to better understand basic features of PPDs and the origin of the structures that are
observed in these objects.

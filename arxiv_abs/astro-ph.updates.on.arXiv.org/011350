Fast radio bursts (FRBs) can be scattered by ionized gas in their local environments, host galaxies,
intervening galaxies along their lines-of-sight, the intergalactic medium, and the Milky Way.
The relative contributions of these different media depend on their geometric configuration and
the internal properties of the gas. When these relative contributions are well understood, FRB
scattering is a powerful probe of density fluctuations along the line-of-sight. Using FRB 121102
and FRB 180916 as case studies, we place an upper limit on the amount of scattering contributed by
the Milky Way halo to FRBs. The scattering time $\tau \propto (\tilde{F} \times {\rm DM}^2) A_\tau$,
where DM is the dispersion measure, $\tilde{F}$ quantifies electron density variations with $\tilde{F}=0$
for a smooth medium, and the dimensionless constant $A_\tau$ quantifies the difference between
the mean scattering delay and the $1/e$ scattering time typically measured. Using a likelihood
analysis we find $(\tilde{F} \times {\rm DM}^2)_{\rm MW, halo} < 250/A_\tau$ pc$^{4/3}$ km$^{-1/3}$
cm$^{-1/3}$. For an assumed halo $\widehat{{\rm DM}}_{\rm MW, halo} = 60 \pm 18$ pc cm$^{-3}$ we
obtain $\tilde{F}_{\rm MW,halo}<0.03/A_\tau$ pc$^{-2/3}$ km$^{-1/3}$. By contrast, pulsar
scattering and DMs imply $\tilde{F} \sim0.1$ pc$^{-2/3}$ km$^{-1/3}$ for the Galactic thin disk
and $\tilde{F}\sim0.001$ pc$^{-2/3}$ km$^{-1/3}$ for the thick disk. The maximum pulse broadening
from the halo is $\tau \lesssim 12$ $\mu$s at 1 GHz. We compare our analysis of the Milky Way halo with
other galaxy haloes by placing limits on the scattering contributions from haloes intersecting
the lines-of-sight to FRB 181112 and FRB 191108. Our results are consistent with haloes making negligible
or very small contributions to the scattering times of FRBs.

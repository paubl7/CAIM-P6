The radial gradient of the rotation rate in the near-surface shear layer (NSSL) of the Sun is independent
of latitude and radius. Theoretical mean-field models have been successful in explaining this
property of the solar NSSL, while global direct convection models have been unsuccessful. We investigate
reason for this discrepancy by measuring the mean flows, Reynolds stress, and turbulent transport
coefficients under NSSL conditions. Simulations have minimal ingredients. These ingredients
are inhomogeneity due to boundaries, anisotropic turbulence, and rotation. Parameters of the
simulations are chosen such they match the weakly rotationally constrained NSSL. The simulations
probe locally Cartesian patches of the star at a given depth and latitude. The depth of the patch is
varied by changing the rotation rate such that the resulting Coriolis numbers<1. We measure the
turbulent transport coefficient relevant for the non-diffusive and diffusive parts of the Reynolds
stress and compare them with predictions of current mean-field theories. A negative radial gradient
of mean flow similar to the solar NSSL is generated only at the equator where meridional flows are
absent. At other latitudes the meridional flow is comparable to the mean flow corresponding to differential
rotation. We also find that meridional components of the Reynolds stress cannot be ignored. Additionally,
we find that the turbulent viscosity is quenched by rotation by about 50\% from the surface to the
bottom of the NSSL. Our local simulations do not validate the explanation for the generation of the
NSSL from mean-field theory where meridional stresses are neglected. However, the rotational
dependence of turbulent viscosity in our simulations is in good agreement with theoretical prediction.
Our results are in qualitative agreement with global convection simulations in that a NSSL obtained
near the equator.

We exploit the unique characteristics of a sample of open clusters (OCs) and field stars for which
high-precision 7Li abundances and stellar parameters are homogeneously derived by the Gaia-ESO
Survey (GES). We derive possibly undepleted 7Li abundances for 26 OCs and star forming regions with
ages from young to old spanning a large range of Galactocentric distances, which allows us to reconstruct
the local late Galactic evolution of lithium as well as its current abundance gradient along the
disc. Field stars are added to look further back in time and to constrain 7Li evolution in other Galactic
components. The data are then compared to theoretical tracks from chemical evolution models that
implement different 7Li forges. We find that the upper envelope of the 7Li abundances measured in
field stars of nearly solar metallicities traces very well the level of lithium enrichment attained
by the ISM as inferred from observations of cluster stars. We confirm previous findings that the
abundance of 7Li in the solar neighbourhood does not decrease at supersolar metallicity. The comparison
of the data with the chemical evolution model predictions favours a scenario in which the majority
of the 7Li abundance in meteorites comes from novae. Current data also seem to suggest that the nova
rate flattens out at later times. This requirement might have implications for the masses of the
white dwarf nova progenitors and deserves further investigation. Neutrino-induced reactions
taking place in core-collapse supernovae also produce some fresh lithium. This likely makes a negligible
contribution to the meteoritic abundance, but could be responsible for a mild increase of the 7Li
abundance in the ISM of low-metallicity systems that would counterbalance the astration processes.

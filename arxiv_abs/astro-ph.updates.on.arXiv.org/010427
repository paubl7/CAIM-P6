Using a general circulation model (GCM), we investigate trends in simulated hot Jupiter atmospheres
for a range of irradiation temperatures (1,500 - 4,000 K), surface gravities (10 and 40 m s-2), and
cloud conditions. Our models include simplified temperature-dependent clouds with radiative
feedback and show how different cloud compositions, vertical thicknesses, and opacities shape
hot Jupiters atmospheres by potentially increasing planetary albedos, decreasing photospheric
pressures and nightside temperatures, and in some cases producing strong dayside thermal inversions.
With decreasing irradiation, clouds progressively form on the nightside and cooler western limb
followed by the eastern limb and central dayside. We find that clouds significantly modify the radiative
transport and affect the observable properties of planets colder than T_irr ~ 3,000~K (T_eq~2,100
K) depending on the clouds' vertical extent. The precise strength of expected effects depends on
the assumed parameters, but trends in predicted phase curves emerge from an ensemble of simulations.
Clouds lead to larger phase curve amplitudes and smaller phase curve offsets at IR wavelengths,
compared to cloud-free models. At optical wavelengths, we predict mostly westward phase curve
offsets at intermediate temperatures (T_irr ~ 2,000 - 3,500 K) with clouds confined to the nightside
and western limb. If clouds are vertically compact (i.e. on order of a pressure scale height in thickness),
their distributions and effects become more complicated as different condensates form at different
heights -- some too deep to significantly affect the observable atmosphere. Our results have implications
for interpreting the diversity of phase curve observations of planets with T_irr <~3,000~K.

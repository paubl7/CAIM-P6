While optical surveys regularly discover slow transients like supernovae on their own, the most
common way to discover extragalactic fast transients, fading away in a few nights, is via follow-up
observations of gamma-ray burst and gravitational-wave triggers. However, wide-field surveys
have the potential to also identify rapidly fading transients independently of such external triggers.
The volumetric survey speed of the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) makes it sensitive to faint and
fast-fading objects as kilonovae, the optical counterparts to binary neutron stars and neutron
star-black hole mergers, out to almost 200Mpc. We introduce an open-source software infrastructure,
the ZTF REaltime Search and Triggering, ZTFReST, designed to identify kilonovae and fast optical
transients in ZTF data. Using the ZTF alert stream combined with forced photometry, we have implemented
automated candidate ranking based on their photometric evolution and fitting to kilonova models.
Automated triggering of follow-up systems, such as Las Cumbres Observatory, has also been implemented.
In 13 months of science validation, we found several extragalactic fast transients independent
of any external trigger (though some counterparts were identified later), including at least one
supernova with post-shock cooling emission, two known afterglows with an associated gamma-ray
burst, two known afterglows without any known gamma-ray counterpart, and three new fast-declining
sources (ZTF20abtxwfx, ZTF20acozryr, and ZTF21aagwbjr) that are likely associated with GRB200817A,
GRB201103B, and GRB210204A. However, we have not found any objects which appear to be kilonovae;
therefore, we constrain the rate of GW170817-like kilonovae to $R < 900$Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$.
A framework such as ZTFReST could become a prime tool for kilonova and fast transient discovery with
the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.

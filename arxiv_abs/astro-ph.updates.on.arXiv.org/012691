Observing the dynamics of compact astrophysical objects provides insights into their inner workings,
thereby probing physics under extreme conditions. The immediate vicinity of an active supermassive
black hole with its event horizon, photon ring, accretion disk, and relativistic jets is a perfect
pace to study general relativity, magneto-hydrodynamics, and high energy plasma physics. The
recent observations of the black hole shadow of M87* with Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI)
by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) open the possibility to investigate its dynamical processes
on time scales of days. In this regime, radio astronomical imaging algorithms are brought to their
limits. Compared to regular radio interferometers, VLBI networks typically have fewer antennas
and low signal to noise ratios (SNRs). If the source is variable during the observational period,
one cannot co-add data on the sky brightness distribution from different time frames to increase
the SNR. Here, we present an imaging algorithm that copes with the data scarcity and the source's
temporal evolution, while simultaneously providing uncertainty quantification on all results.
Our algorithm views the imaging task as a Bayesian inference problem of a time-varying brightness,
exploits the correlation structure between time frames, and reconstructs an entire, $\mathbf{2+1+1}$
dimensional time-variable and spectrally resolved image at once. The degree of correlation in
the spatial and the temporal domains is inferred from the data and no form of correlation is excluded
a priori. We apply this method to the EHT observation of M87* and validate our approach on synthetic
data. The time- and frequency-resolved reconstruction of M87* confirms variable structures on
the emission ring on a time scale of days. The reconstruction indicates extended and time-variable
emission structures outside the ring itself.

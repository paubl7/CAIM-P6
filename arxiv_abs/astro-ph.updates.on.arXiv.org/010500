Years-long high-precision brightness measurements obtained with telescopes operating in space
have become available for thousands of stars. Such data allowed us to measure the physics of stellar
interiors via nonradial oscillations, opening a new avenue to study the stars in the Universe. Asteroseismology,
the interpretation of the characteristics of oscillation modes in terms of the physical properties
of the stellar interior, brought entirely new insights in how stars rotate and how they build up their
chemistry throughout their evolution. We discuss how data-driven space asteroseismology delivered
a drastic increase in the reliability of computer models mimicking the evolution of stars born with
a variety of masses and metalicities. Such models are critical ingredients for modern physics as
a whole, because they are used throughout various contemporary and multidisciplinary research
fields in space science, including the search for life outside the solar system, archaeological
studies of the Milky Way, and the study of single and binary supernova progenitors, among which future
gravitational wave sources. We illustrate the specific role and potential of asteroseismology
for those modern research fields. We end with current limitations of asteroseismology and highlight
how they can be overcome with ongoing and future large infrastructures for survey astronomy combined
with new theoretical research in the era of high-performance computing. This review presents results
obtained thanks to major community efforts over the past decade. These breakthroughs were achieved
in a collaborative and inclusive spirit so characteristic of the asteroseismology community.
The aim was to write it so as to make this research field well accessible to graduate students and readers
from other fields in physics, with incentives to enjoy and join future applications in this glorious
domain of astrophysics.

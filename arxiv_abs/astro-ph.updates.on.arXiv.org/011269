We present the Stromlo Stellar Tracks, a set of stellar evolutionary tracks, computed by modifying
the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) 1D stellar evolution package, to fit
the Galactic Concordance abundances for hot ($T > 8000$ K) massive ($\geq 10M_\odot$) Main-Sequence
(MS) stars. Until now, all stellar evolution tracks are computed at solar, scaled-solar, or alpha-element
enhanced abundances, and none of these models correctly represent the Galactic Concordance abundances
at different metallicities. This paper is the first implementation of Galactic Concordance abundances
to the stellar evolution models. The Stromlo tracks cover massive stars ($10\leq M/M_\odot \leq
300$) with varying rotations ($v/v_{\rm crit} = 0.0, 0.2, 0.4$) and a finely sampled grid of metallicities
($-2.0 \leq {\rm [Z/H]} \leq +0.5$; $\Delta {\rm [Z/H]} = 0.1$) evolved from the pre-main sequence
to the end of $^{12}$Carbon burning. We find that the implementation of Galactic Concordance abundances
is critical for the evolution of main-sequence, massive hot stars in order to estimate accurate
stellar outputs (L, T$_{\rm eff}$, $g$), which, in turn, have a significant impact on determining
the ionizing photon luminosity budgets. We additionally support prior findings of the importance
that rotation plays on the evolution of massive stars and their ionizing budget. The evolutionary
tracks for our Galactic Concordance abundance scaling provide a more empirically motivated approach
than simple uniform abundance scaling with metallicity for the analysis of \HII\ regions and have
considerable implications in determining nebular emission lines and metallicity. Therefore,
it is important to refine the existing stellar evolutionary models for comprehensive high-redshift
extragalactic studies. The Stromlo tracks are publicly available to the astronomical community
online.

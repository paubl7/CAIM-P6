El Gordo (ACT-CL J0102-4915) is an extremely massive galaxy cluster ($M_{200} \approx 3 \times
10^{15}$ $M_{\odot}$) at redshift $z = 0.87 $ composed of two subclusters with mass ratio 3.6 merging
at speed $V_{infall} \approx 2500$ km/s. Such a fast collision between individually rare massive
clusters is unexpected in Lambda cold dark matter ($\Lambda$CDM) cosmology at such high $z$. However,
this is required for non-cosmological hydrodynamical simulations of the merger to match its observed
properties (Zhang et al. 2015). Here, we determine the probability of finding a similar object in
a $\Lambda$CDM context using the Jubilee simulation box with side length $6 \, h^{-1}$ Gpc. We search
for galaxy cluster pairs that have turned around from the cosmic expansion with properties similar
to El Gordo in terms of total mass, mass ratio, redshift, and collision velocity relative to virial
velocity. We fit the distribution of pair total mass quite accurately, with the fits used in two methods
to infer the probability of observing El Gordo in the surveyed region. The more conservative (and
detailed) method involves considering the expected distribution of pairwise mass and redshift
for analogue pairs with similar dimensionless parameters to El Gordo in the past lightcone of a $z
= 0$ observer. Detecting one pair with its mass and redshift rules out $\Lambda$CDM cosmology at
$6.16\sigma$. We also use the results of Kraljic & Sarkar (2015) to show that the Bullet Cluster is
in $2.78\sigma$ tension once the sky coverage of its discovery survey is accounted for. Using a $\chi^2$
approach, the combined tension can be estimated as $6.43 \sigma$. Both collisions arise naturally
in a Milgromian dynamics (MOND) cosmology with light sterile neutrinos.

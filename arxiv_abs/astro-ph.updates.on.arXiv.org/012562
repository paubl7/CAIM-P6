An ultra-light bosonic particle of mass around $10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ is of special interest
as a dark matter candidate, as it both has particle physics motivations, and may give rise to notable
differences in the structures on highly non-linear scales due to the manifestation of quantum-physical
wave effects on macroscopic scales, which could address a number of contentious small-scale tensions
in the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM. Using a spectral technique, we here discuss
simulations of such fuzzy dark matter (FDM), including the full non-linear wave dynamics, with
a comparatively large dynamic range and for larger box sizes than considered previously. While
the impact of suppressed small-scale power in the initial conditions associated with FDM has been
studied before, the characteristic FDM dynamics are often neglected; in our simulations, we instead
show the impact of the full non-linear dynamics on physical observables. We focus on the evolution
of the matter power spectrum, give first results for the FDM halo mass function directly based on
full FDM simulations, and discuss the computational challenges associated with the FDM equations.
FDM shows a pronounced suppression of power on small scales relative to cold dark matter (CDM), which
can be understood as a damping effect due to 'quantum pressure'. In certain regimes, however, the
FDM power can exceed that of CDM, which may be interpreted as a reflection of order-unity density
fluctuations occurring in FDM. In the halo mass function, FDM shows a significant abundance reduction
below a characteristic mass scale only. This could in principle alleviate the need to invoke very
strong feedback processes in small galaxies to reconcile $\Lambda$CDM with the observed galaxy
luminosity function, but detailed studies that also include baryons will be needed to ultimately
judge the viability of FDM.

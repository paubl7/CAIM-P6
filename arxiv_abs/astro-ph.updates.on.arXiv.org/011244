We present validation tests of emulator-based halo model method for cosmological parameter inference,
assuming hypothetical measurements of the projected correlation function of galaxies, $w_{\rm
p}(R)$, and the galaxy-galaxy weak lensing, $\Delta\!\Sigma(R)$, from the spectroscopic SDSS
galaxies and the Hyper Suprime-Cam Year1 (HSC-Y1) galaxies. To do this, we use \textsc{Dark Emulator}
developed in Nishimichi et al. based on an ensemble of $N$-body simulations, which is an emulation
package enabling a fast, accurate computation of halo clustering quantities for flat-geometry
$w$CDM cosmologies. Adopting the halo occupation distribution, the emulator allows us to obtain
model predictions of $\Delta\!\Sigma$ and $w_{\rm p}$ for the SDSS-like galaxies at a few CPU seconds
for an input set of parameters. We present performance and validation of the method by carrying out
Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses of the mock signals measured from a variety of mock catalogs that
mimic the SDSS and HSC-Y1 galaxies. We show that the halo model method can recover the underlying
true cosmological parameters to within the 68\% credible interval, except for the mocks including
the assembly bias effect (although we consider the unrealistically-large amplitude of assembly
bias effect). Even for the assembly bias mock, we demonstrate that the cosmological parameters
can be recovered {\it if} the analysis is restricted to scales $R\gtrsim 10~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc}$. We
also show that, by using a single population of source galaxies to infer the relative strengths of
$\Delta\!\Sigma$ for multiple lens samples at different redshifts, the joint probes method allows
for self-calibration of photometric redshift errors and multiplicative shear bias. Thus we conclude
that the emulator-based halo model method can be safely applied to the HSC-Y1 dataset, achieving
a precision of $\sigma(S_8)\simeq 0.04$.

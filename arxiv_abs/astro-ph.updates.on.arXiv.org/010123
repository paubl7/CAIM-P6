Context: A census of faint and tiny star forming complexes at high redshift is key for the understanding
of the reionizing sources, galaxy growth and the formation of globular clusters. Aims: We present
the MUSE deep lensed field (MDLF) program. Methods: Deep MUSE observations of 17.1 hours integration
on a single pointing over the Hubble Frontier Field galaxy cluster MACS~J0416 are described. Results:
We confirm 182 multiple images in the redshift range 0.9<z<6.6 (from the previously known 102),
emerging from 66 families drawn from 48 individual background sources. We identify 116 clumps belonging
to background high-z galaxies; the majority of them are multiple images and span magnitude, size
and redshift intervals of [-18,-10], [~400-3] parsec and 1<z<6.6, respectively, with the faintest
and/or most magnified ones probing possible single gravitationally-bound star clusters. The
depth of the MDLF combined with lensing magnification lead us to reach a detection limit for unresolved
emission lines of a few 10$^{-20}$ erg/s/cm2, after correction for lensing magnification. Ultraviolet
high-ionization metal lines (and HeII1640) are detected with S/N>10 for individual objects down
to de-lensed magnitude 28-30 suggesting that they are common in such faint sources. Conclusions:Deep
MUSE observations, in combination with existing HST imaging, allowed us to: (1) confirm redshifts
for extremely faint high-z sources; (2) peer into their internal clumps (down to 100-200 pc scale);
(3) in some cases break down such clumps into bound star clusters (<25 pc scale); (4) double the number
of constraints for the lens model, reaching an unprecedented set of 182 bona-fide multiple images
and confirming up to 213 galaxy cluster members. These results demonstrate the power that JWST and
future ELTs will have when combined to study gravitational telescopes.[abridged]

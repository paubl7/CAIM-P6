Fixing the relationship of a set of experimental quantities is a fundamental issue in many scientific
disciplines. In the 2D case, the classical approach is to compute the linear correlation coefficient
from a scatterplot. This method, however, implicitly assumes a linear relationship between the
variables. Such an assumption is not always correct. With the use of the partial correlation coefficients,
an extension to the multidimensional case is possible. However, the problem of the assumed mutual
linear relationship of the variables remains. A relatively recent approach that makes it possible
to avoid this problem is the modeling of the joint probability density function (PDF) of the data
with copulas. These are functions that contain all the information on the relationship between
two random variables. Although in principle this approach also can work with multidimensional
data, theoretical as well computational difficulties often limit its use to the 2D case. In this
paper, we consider an approach based on so-called vine copulas, which overcomes this limitation
and at the same time is amenable to a theoretical treatment and feasible from the computational point
of view. We applied this method to published data on the near-IR and far-IR luminosities and atomic
and molecular masses of the Herschel reference sample, a volume-limited sample in the nearby Universe.
We determined the relationship of the luminosities and gas masses and show that the far-IR luminosity
can be considered as the key parameter relating the other three quantities. Once removed from the
4D relation, the residual relation among the latter is negligible. This may be interpreted as the
correlation between the gas masses and near-IR luminosity being driven by the far-IR luminosity,
likely by the star formation activity of the galaxy.

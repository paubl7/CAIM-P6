(abridged version) We present a detailed spectroscopic and timing analysis of X-ray observations
of the bright radio-to-gamma-ray emitting pulsar PSR B0656+14, which were obtained simultaneously
with eROSITA and XMM-Newton during the Calibration and Performance Verification phase of the Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma
mission (SRG) for 100 ks. Using XMM-Newton and NICER we firstly established an X-ray ephemeris for
the time interval 2015 to 2020, which connects all X-ray observations in this period without cycle
count alias and phase shifts. The mean eROSITA spectrum clearly reveals an absorption feature originating
from the star at 570 eV with a Gaussian sigma of about 70 eV, tentatively identified earlier in a long
XMM-Newton observation (Arumugasamy et al. 2018). A second absorption feature, described here
as an absorption edge, occurs at 260-265 eV. It could be of atmospheric or of instrumental origin.
These absorption features are superposed on various emission components, phenomenologically
described as the sum of hot (120 eV) and cold (65 eV) blackbody components, both of photospheric origin,
and a power-law with photon index Gamma=2. The phase-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the Gaussian
absorption line at 570 eV is clearly present throughout ~60% of the spin cycle. The visibility of
the line strength coincides in phase with the maximum flux of the hot blackbody. We also present three
families of model atmospheres: a magnetised atmosphere, a condensed surface, and a mixed model,
which were applied to the mean observed spectrum and whose continuum fit the observed data well.
The atmosphere model, however, predicts too short distances. For the mixed model, the Gaussian
absorption may be interpreted as proton cyclotron absorption in a field as high as 10^14 G, which
is significantly higher than that derived from the moderate observed spin-down.

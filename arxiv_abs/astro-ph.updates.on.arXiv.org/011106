Gravitational-wave signals from coalescing binary neutron stars can yield important information
about the properties of nuclear-matter equation of state from the early part of the signal through
tidal effects to the properties and oscillation frequencies of the merger product. We investigate
a direct link between the properties of isolated neutron stars and their merger, by comparing the
frequency of the fundamental oscillation mode ($f$-mode) of neutron stars with the gravitational-wave
frequency associated with the merger of two neutron stars. We calculate the quadrupolar ($l=2$)
$f$-mode oscillation ($f_{2f}$) of non-rotating and rotating neutron stars using a nonlinear
hydrodynamics code in the conformally-flat approximation and obtain the gravitational-wave
frequency associated with the peak amplitude ($f_{\rm max}$) of binary-neutron stars from a set
of publicly available simulations. We find that $f_{\rm max}$ and $f_{2f}$ differ by about 1\%,
on average, across forty-five equal-mass systems with different total mass and equations of state.
Assuming that the gravitational-wave frequency is still approximately equal to twice the orbital
frequency $\Omega$ near the merger, the result indicates that the condition for tidal resonance
$|m|\Omega = f_{2f}$ is satisfied to high accuracy near the merger, where $m=2$ is the azimuthal
quantum number. Moreover, the well established universal relation between $f_{\rm max}$ and the
tidal deformability of equal-mass binary systems can now be explained by a similar relation between
$f_{2f}$ and the tidal deformability of isolated neutron stars, which has been demonstrated to
be associated with the nearly incompressible properties of neutron stars. Our findings suggest
that it is possible to relate the gravitational-wave signal at the merger of a binary neutron star
system directly to the fundamental oscillation modes and the mass ratio.

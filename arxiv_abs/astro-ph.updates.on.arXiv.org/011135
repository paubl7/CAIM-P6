The incredible longevity of Cassini's orbital mission at Saturn has provided the most comprehensive
exploration of a seasonal giant planet to date. This review explores Saturn's changing global temperatures,
composition, and aerosol properties between northern spring and summer solstice (2015-2017),
extending our previous review of Cassini's remote sensing investigations (2004-14, Fletcher
et al., 2018) to the grand finale. The result is an unprecedented record of Saturn's climate that
spans almost half a Saturnian year, which can be used to test the seasonal predictions of radiative
climate models, neutral and ion photochemistry models, and atmospheric circulation models. Hemispheric
asymmetries in tropospheric and stratospheric temperatures were observed to reverse from northern
winter to northern summer; spatial distributions of hydrocarbons and para-hydrogen shifted in
response to atmospheric dynamics (e.g., seasonally-reversing Hadley cells, polar stratospheric
vortex formation, equatorial stratospheric oscillations, and inter-hemispheric transport);
and upper tropospheric and stratospheric aerosols exhibited changes in optical thickness that
modulated Saturn's visible colours (from blue hues to a golden appearance in the north near solstice),
reflectivity, and near-infrared emission. Numerical simulations of radiative balance and photochemistry
do a good job in reproducing the observed seasonal change and phase lags, but discrepancies between
models and observations still persist, indicating a crucial role for atmospheric dynamics and
the need to couple chemical and radiative schemes to the next generation of circulation models.
With Cassini's demise, an extended study of Saturn's seasons, from northern summer to autumn, will
require the capabilities of ground- and space-based observatories, as we eagerly await the next
orbital explorer at Saturn.

Assessing the probability that two or more gravitational waves (GWs) are lensed images of the same
source requires an understanding of the image properties, including their relative phase shifts
in strong lensing (SL). For non-precessing, circular binaries dominated by quadrupole radiation
these phase shifts are degenerate with either a shift in the coalescence phase or a detector and inclination
dependent shift in the orientation angle. This degeneracy is broken by the presence of higher harmonic
modes with $|m|\ne 2$ in the former and $|m| \ne l$ in the latter. Precession or eccentricity will
also break this degeneracy. This implies that lensed GWs will not necessarily be consistent with
(unlensed) predictions from general relativity (GR). Therefore, unlike EM lensing, GW SL can lead
to images with an observable modified phase evolution. However, for a wide parameter space, the
lensed waveform is similar enough to an unlensed waveform that detection pipelines will still find
it. For present detectors, templates with a shifted detector-dependent orientation angle have
SNR differences of less than $1\%$ for mass ratios up to 0.1, and less than $5\%$ for precession parameters
up to 0.5 and eccentricities up to 0.4 at 20Hz. The mismatch is lower than $10\%$ with the alternative
detector-independent coalescence phase shift. Nonetheless, for a loud enough source, even with
one image it may be possible to directly identify it as a SL image from its non-GR waveform. In more
extreme cases, lensing may lead to considerable distortions, and the lensed GWs may be undetected
with current searches. Nevertheless, an exact template with a phase shift in Fourier space can always
be constructed to fit any lensed GW. We conclude that an optimal search strategy would incorporate
phase information in all stages, with an exact treatment in the final assessment of the probability
of multiple lensed events.

The coupling of the atmosphere to the space environment has become recognized as an important driver
of atmospheric chemistry and dynamics. In order to quantify the effects of particle precipitation
on the atmosphere, reliable global energy inputs on spatial scales commensurate with particle
precipitation variations are required. To that end, we have validated the Special Sensor Ultraviolet
Spectrographic Imagers (SSUSI) products for average electron energy and electron energy flux
by comparing to EISCAT electron density profiles. This comparison shows that SSUSI FUV observations
can be used to provide ionization rate profiles throughout the auroral region. The SSUSI on board
the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP) Block 5D3 satellites provide nearly hourly,
high-resolution UV snapshots of auroral emissions. Here we use the SSUSI-derived energies and
fluxes to drive standard parametrizations in order to obtain ionization-rate and electron-density
profiles in the E-region (90--150 km), which are then compared to EISCAT ground-based electron
density measurements. We compare the data from two satellites, DMSP F17 and F18, to the Troms{\o}
UHF radar profiles. We find that differentiating between the magnetic local time (MLT) morning
(3--11 h) and evening (15--23 h) provides the best fit to the ground-based data. The data agree well
in the MLT morning sector using a Maxwellian electron spectrum, while in the evening sector using
a Gaussian spectrum and accounting for bounce-electrons achieved optimum agreement with EISCAT.
Depending on the satellite and MLT, the median of the differences varies between 0 and 20% above 105
km (F17) and $\pm$15% above 100 km (F18). Because of the large gradient below those altitudes, the
relative differences get larger without substantially increasing absolute differences, with
virtually no statistically significant differences at the 1-sigma level.

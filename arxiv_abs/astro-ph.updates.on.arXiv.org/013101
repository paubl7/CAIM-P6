Low Density Points (LDPs, \citet{2019ApJ...874....7D}), obtained by removing high-density
regions of observed galaxies, can trace the Large-Scale Structures (LSSs) of the universe. In particular,
it offers an intriguing opportunity to detect weak gravitational lensing from low-density regions.
In this work, we investigate tomographic cross-correlation between Planck CMB lensing maps and
LDP-traced LSSs, where LDPs are constructed from the DR8 data release of the DESI legacy imaging
survey, with about $10^6$-$10^7$ galaxies. We find that, due to the large sky coverage (20,000 deg$^2$)
and large redshift depth ($z\leq 1.2$), a significant detection ($10\sigma$--$30\sigma$) of
the CMB lensing-LDP cross-correlation in all six redshift bins can be achieved, with a total significance
of $\sim 53\sigma$ over $ \ell\le1024$. Moreover, the measurements are in good agreement with a
theoretical template constructed from our numerical simulation in the WMAP 9-year $\Lambda$CDM
cosmology. A scaling factor for the lensing amplitude $A_{\rm lens}$ is constrained to $A_{\rm
lens}=1\pm0.12$ for $z<0.2$, $A_{\rm lens}=1.07\pm0.07$ for $0.2<z<0.4$ and $A_{\rm lens}=1.07\pm0.05$
for $0.4<z<0.6$, with the r-band absolute magnitude cut of $-21.5$ for LDP selection. A variety
of tests have been performed to check the detection reliability, against variations in LDP samples
and galaxy magnitude cuts, masks, CMB lensing maps, multipole $\ell$ cuts, sky regions, and photo-z
bias. We also perform a cross-correlation measurement between CMB lensing and galaxy number density,
which is consistent with the CMB lensing-LDP cross-correlation. This work therefore further convincingly
demonstrates that LDP is a competitive tracer of LSS.

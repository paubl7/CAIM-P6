The nature of the peculiar `Ca-rich' SN 2019ehk in the nearby galaxy M100 remains unclear. Its origin
has been debated as either a stripped core-collapse supernova or a thermonuclear helium detonation
event. Here, we present very late-time photometry of the transient obtained with the Keck I telescope
at $\approx280$ days from peak light. Using the photometry to perform accurate flux calibration
of a contemporaneous nebular phase spectrum, we measure an [O I] luminosity of $(0.19-1.08)\times10^{38}$
erg s$^{-1}$ and [Ca II] luminosity of $(2.7-15.6)\times10^{38}$ erg s$^{-1}$ over the range of
the uncertain extinction along the line of sight. We use these measurements to derive lower limits
on the synthesized oxygen mass of $\approx0.004-0.069$ M$_\odot$. The oxygen mass is a sensitive
tracer of the progenitor mass for core-collapse supernovae, and our estimate is consistent with
explosions of very low mass CO cores of $1.45-1.5$ M$_\odot$, corresponding to He core masses of
$\approx1.8-2.0$ M$_\odot$. We present high quality peak light optical spectra of the transient
and highlight features of hydrogen in both the early (`flash') and photospheric phase spectra,
that suggest the presence of $\gtrsim0.02$ M$_\odot$ of hydrogen in the progenitor at the time of
explosion. The presence of H, together with the large [Ca II]/[O I] ratio ($\approx10-15$) in the
nebular phase is consistent with SN 2019ehk being a Type IIb core-collapse supernova from a stripped
low mass ($\approx9-9.5$ M$_\odot$) progenitor, similar to the Ca-rich SN IIb iPTF 15eqv. These
results provide evidence for a likely class of `Ca-rich' core-collapse supernovae from stripped
low mass progenitors in star forming environments, distinct from the thermonuclear Ca-rich gap
transients in old environments.

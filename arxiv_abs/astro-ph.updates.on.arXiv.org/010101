Theoretical modeling of massive stars predicts a gap in the black hole (BH) mass function above $\sim
40-50\,M_{\odot}$ for BHs formed through single star evolution, arising from (pulsational) pair-instability
supernovae. However, in dense star clusters, dynamical channels may exist that allow construction
of BHs with masses in excess of those allowed from single star evolution. The detection of BHs in this
so-called "upper-mass gap" would provide strong evidence for the dynamical processing of BHs prior
to their eventual merger. Here, we explore in detail the formation of BHs with masses within or above
the pair-instability gap through collisions of young massive stars in dense star clusters. We run
a suite of 68 independent cluster simulations, exploring a variety of physical assumptions pertaining
to growth through stellar collisions, including primordial cluster mass segregation and the efficiency
of envelope stripping during collisions. We find that as many as $\sim20\%$ of all BH progenitors
undergo one or more collisions prior to stellar collapse and up to $\sim1\%$ of all BHs reside within
or above the pair-instability gap through the effects of these collisions. We show that these BHs
readily go on to merge with other BHs in the cluster, creating a population of massive BH mergers at
a rate that may compete with the "multiple-generation" merger channel described in other analyses.
This has clear relevance for the formation of very massive BH binaries as recently detected by LIGO/Virgo
in GW190521. Finally, we describe how stellar collisions in clusters may provide a unique pathway
to pair-instability supernovae and briefly discuss the expected rate of these events and other
electromagnetic transients.

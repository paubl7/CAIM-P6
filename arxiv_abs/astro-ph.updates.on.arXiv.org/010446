We investigate the inherently nonlinear transverse modes of the gravitational and velocity fields
in $\Lambda$CDM, based on a high-resolution simulation performed using the adaptive-mesh refinement
general-relativistic $N$-body code GRAMSES. We study the generation of vorticity in the dark matter
velocity field at low redshift, providing power-law fits to the shape and evolution of its power
spectrum from large sub-horizon scales to deeply nonlinear scales. By analysing the gravitomagnetic
vector potential, a purely relativistic vector mode of the gravitational field that is absent in
Newtonian simulations, in dark matter haloes with masses from $\sim10^{12.5}~h^{-1}{M}_{\odot}$
to $\sim10^{15}~h^{-1}{M}_{\odot}$, we find that the magnitude of this vector correlates with
the halo mass, peaking in the inner regions and decreasing towards their outskirts. Nevertheless,
on average, its ratio against the scalar gravitational potential remains fairly constant inside
the haloes, below percent level, decreasing roughly linearly with redshift at $z<3$ and showing
a weak dependence on halo mass. Furthermore, we show that the gravitomagnetic acceleration in dark
matter haloes peaks towards the core and reaches almost $10^{-10}$ $h$ cm/s$^2$ in the most massive
halo of the simulation. However, regardless of the halo mass, the ratio between the magnitudes of
the gravitomagnetic force and the standard gravitational force is typically at around $10^{-3}$
in the innermost parts of the haloes and drops by up to one order of magnitude at the outskirts. This
ratio shows a very weak dependence on redshift. This result confirms that the gravitomagnetic field
has a negligible effect on cosmic structure formation, even for the most massive structures, although
its behaviour in low density regions remains to be explored. Its effects on photons and observations
remains to be understood in detail in the future.

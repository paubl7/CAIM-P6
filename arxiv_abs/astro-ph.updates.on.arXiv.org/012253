We investigate the formation and growth of massive black hole (BH) seeds in dusty star-forming galaxies,
relying and extending the framework proposed by Boco et al. 2020. Specifically, the latter envisages
the migration of stellar compact remnants (neutron stars and stellar-mass black holes) via gaseous
dynamical friction towards the galaxy nuclear region, and their subsequent merging to grow a massive
central BH seed. In this paper we add two relevant ingredients: (i) we include primordial BHs, that
could constitute a fraction $f_{\rm pBH}$ of the dark matter, as an additional component participating
in the seed growth; (ii) we predict the stochastic gravitational wave background originated during
the seed growth, both from stellar compact remnant and from primordial BH mergers. We find that the
latter events contribute most to the initial growth of the central seed during a timescale of $10^6-10^7\,\rm
yr$, before stellar compact remnant mergers and gas accretion take over. In addition, if the fraction
of primordial BHs $f_{\rm pBH}$ is large enough, gravitational waves emitted by their mergers in
the nuclear galactic regions could be detected by future interferometers like Einsten Telescope,
DECIGO and LISA. As for the associated stochastic gravitational wave background, we predict that
it extends over the wide frequency band $10^{-6}\lesssim f [{\rm Hz}]\lesssim 10$, which is very
different from the typical range originated by mergers of isolated binary compact objects. On the
one hand, the detection of such a background could be a smoking gun to test the proposed seed growth
mechanism; on the other hand, it constitutes a relevant contaminant from astrophysical sources
to be characterized and subtracted, in the challenging search for a primordial background of cosmological
origin.

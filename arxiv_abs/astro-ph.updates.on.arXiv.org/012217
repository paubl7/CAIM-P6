Context. Kepler-444 is one of the oldest planetary systems known thus far. Its peculiar configuration
consisting of five sub-Earth-sized planets orbiting the companion to a binary stellar system makes
its early history puzzling. Moreover, observations of HI-Ly-$\rm \alpha$ variations raise many
questions about the potential presence of escaping atmospheres today. Aims. We aim to study the
orbital evolution of Kepler-444-d and Kepler-444-e and the impact of atmospheric evaporation
on Kepler-444-e. Methods. Rotating stellar models of Kepler-444-A were computed with the Geneva
stellar evolution code and coupled to an orbital evolution code, accounting for the effects of dynamical,
equilibrium tides and atmospheric evaporation. The impacts of multiple stellar rotational histories
and extreme ultraviolet (XUV) luminosity evolutionary tracks are explored. Results. Using detailed
rotating stellar models able to reproduce the rotation rate of Kepler-444-A, we find that its observed
rotation rate is perfectly in line with what is expected for this old K0-type star, indicating that
there is no reason for it to be exceptionally active as would be required to explain the observed HI-Ly-$\rm
\alpha$ variations from a stellar origin. We show that given the low planetary mass ($\sim$ 0.03
M$_{\rm \oplus}$) and relatively large orbital distance ($\sim$ 0.06 AU) of Kepler-444-d and e,
dynamical tides negligibly affect their orbits, regardless of the stellar rotational history
considered. We point out instead how remarkable the impact is of the stellar rotational history
on the estimation of the lifetime mass loss for Kepler-444-e. We show that, even in the case of an extremely
slow rotating star, it seems unlikely that such a planet could retain a fraction of the initial water-ice
content if we assume that it formed with a Ganymede-like composition.

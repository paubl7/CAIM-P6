We construct a dynamical model of the Milky Way disk from a data set, which combines Gaia EDR3 and APOGEE
data throughout Galactocentric radii between $5.0\leq R\leq19.5$ kpc. We make use of the spherically-aligned
Jeans Anisotropic Method to model the stellar velocities and their velocity dispersions. Building
upon our previous work, our model now is fitted to kinematic maps that have been extended to larger
Galactocentric radii due to the expansion of our data set, probing the outer regions of the Galactic
disk. Our best-fitting dynamical model suggests a logarithmic density slope of $\alpha_{\rm DM}=-1.602\pm0.079_{\rm
syst}$ for the dark matter halo and a dark matter density of $\rho_{\rm DM}(R_{\odot})=(8.92\pm0.56_{\rm
syst})\times 10^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$ ($0.339\pm0.022_{\rm syst}$ GeV cm$^{3}$). We
estimate a circular velocity at the solar radius of $v_{\rm circ}=(234.7\pm1.7_{\rm syst})$ km
s$^{-1}$ with a decline towards larger radii. The total mass density is $\rho_{\rm tot}(R_{\odot})$=$(0.0672\pm0.0015_{\rm
syst})$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-3}$ with a slope of $\alpha_{\rm tot}$=$-2.367\pm0.047_{\rm syst}$
for $5\leq R\leq19.5$ kpc and the total surface density is $\Sigma(R{_\odot}, |z|\leq$ 1.1 kpc)=$(55.5\pm1.7_{\rm
syst})$ M$_{\odot}$ pc$^{-2}$. While the statistical errors are small, the error budget of the
derived quantities is dominated by the 3 to 7 times larger systematic uncertainties. These values
are consistent with our previous determination, but systematic uncertainties are reduced due
to the extended data set covering a larger spatial extent of the Milky Way disk. Furthermore, we test
the influence of non-axisymmetric features on our resulting model and analyze how a flaring disk
model would change our findings.

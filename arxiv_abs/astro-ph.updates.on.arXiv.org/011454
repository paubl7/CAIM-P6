We report the discovery of a spectroscopically-confirmed strong Lyman-$\alpha$ emitter at $z=7.0281\pm0.0003$,
observed as part of the Reionization Cluster Lensing Survey (RELICS). This galaxy, dubbed "Dichromatic
Primeval Galaxy" at $z\sim7$ (DP7), shows two distinct components. While fairly unremarkable
in terms of its ultraviolet (UV) luminosity ($\sim0.3L^{\ast}_{UV}$, where $L^{\ast}_{UV}$
is the characteristic luminosity), DP7 has one of the highest observed Lyman-$\alpha$ equivalent
widths (EWs) among Lyman-$\alpha$ emitters at $z>6$ ($>200$ Angstrom in the rest frame). The strong
Lyman-$\alpha$ emission generally suggests a young metal-poor, low-dust galaxy; however, we
find that the UV slope $\beta$ of the galaxy as a whole is redder than typical star-forming galaxies
at these redshifts, $-1.13\pm 0.84$, likely indicating, on average, a considerable amount of dust
obscuration, or an older stellar population. When we measure $\beta$ for the two components separately,
however, we find evidence of differing UV colors, suggesting two separate stellar populations.
Also, we find that Lyman-$\alpha$ is spatially extended and likely larger than the galaxy size,
hinting to the possible existence of a Lyman-$\alpha$ halo. Rejuvenation or merging events could
explain these results. Either scenario requires an extreme stellar population, possibly including
a component of Population III stars, or an obscured Active Galactic Nucleus. DP7, with its low UV
luminosity and high Lyman-$\alpha$ EW, represents the typical galaxies that are thought to be the
major contribution to the reionization of the Universe, and for this reason DP7 is an excellent target
for follow-up with the James Webb Space Telescope.

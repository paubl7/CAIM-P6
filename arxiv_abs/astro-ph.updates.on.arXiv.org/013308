The observations of compact star inspirals from LIGO/Virgo provide a valuable tool to study the
highly uncertain equation of state (EOS) of dense matter at the densities in which the compact stars
reside. It is not clear whether the merging stars are neutron stars or quark stars containing self-bound
quark matter. In this work, we explore the allowed bag-model-like EOSs by assuming the merging stars
are strange quark stars (SQSs) from a Bayesian analysis employing the tidal deformability observational
data of the GW170817 and GW190425 binary mergers. We consider two extreme states of strange quark
matter, either in nonsuperfluid or color-flavor locked (CFL) and find the results in these two cases
essentially reconcile. In particular, our results indicate that the sound speed in the SQS matter
is approximately a constant close to the conformal limit of $c/\sqrt{3}$. The universal relations
between the mass, the tidal deformability and the compactness are provided for the SQSs. The most
probable values of the maximum mass are found to be $M_{\rm TOV}=2.10_{-0.12}^{+0.12}~(2.15_{-0.14}^{+0.16})\,M_{\odot}$
for normal (CFL) SQSs at a $90\%$ confidence level. The corresponding radius and tidal deformability
for a $1.4\,M_{\odot}$ star are $R_{\rm 1.4}= 11.50_{-0.55}^{+0.52}~({11.42}_{-0.44}^{+0.52})~\rm
km$ and $\Lambda_{1.4}= {650}_{-190}^{+230}~({630}_{-150}^{+220})$, respectively. We also
investigate the possibility of GW190814's secondary component $m_2$ of mass $2.59_{-0.09}^{+0.08}\,M_{\odot}$
being an SQS, and find that it could be a CFL SQS with the pairing gap $\Delta$ larger than $244~\rm
MeV$ and the effective bag parameter $B_{\rm eff}^{1/4}$ in the range of $170$ to $192$ MeV, at a $90\%$
confidence level.

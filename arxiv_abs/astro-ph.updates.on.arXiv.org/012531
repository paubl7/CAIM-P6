(abridged) Context: The ratio of kinematic viscosity to thermal diffusivity, the Prandtl number,
is much smaller than unity in stellar convection zones. Aims: To study the statistics of convective
flows and energy transport as functions of the Prandtl number. Methods: Three-dimensional numerical
simulations convection in Cartesian geometry are used. The convection zone (CZ) is embedded between
two stably stratified layers. Statistics and transport properties of up- and downflows are studied
separately. Results: The rms velocity increases with decreasing Prandtl number. At the same time
the filling factor of downflows decreases and leads to stronger downflows at lower Prandtl numbers,
and to a strong dependence of overshooting on the Prandtl number. Velocity power spectra do not show
marked changes as a function of Prandtl number. At the highest Reynolds numbers the velocity power
spectra are compatible with the Bolgiano-Obukhov $k^{-11/5}$ scaling. The horizontally averaged
convected energy flux ($\overline{F}_{\rm conv}$) is independent of the Prandtl number within
the CZ. However, the upflows (downflows) are the dominant contribution to the convected flux at
low (high) Prandtl number. These results are similar to those from Rayleigh-Ben\'ard convection
in the low Prandtl number regime where convection is vigorously turbulent but inefficient at transporting
energy. Conclusions: The current results indicate a strong dependence of convective overshooting
and energy flux on the Prandtl number. Numerical simulations of astrophysical convection often
use Prandtl number of unity. The current results suggest that this can lead to misleading results
and that the astrophysically relevant low Prandtl number regime is qualitatively different from
the parameters regimes explored in typical simulations.

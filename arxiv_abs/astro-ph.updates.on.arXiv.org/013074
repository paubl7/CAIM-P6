We present new two-fluid models of accretion disks in active galactic nuclei (AGN) that aim to address
the long-standing problem of Toomre instability in AGN outskirts. In the spirit of earlier work
by Sirko & Goodman 2003, and others, we argue that Toomre instability is eventually self-regulated
via feedback produced by fragmentation and its aftermath. Unlike past semi-analytic models, which
(i) adopt local prescriptions to connect star formation rates to heat feedback, and (ii) assume
that AGN disks self-regulate to a star-forming steady state (with Toomre parameter Q=1), we find
that feedback processes are both temporally and spatially non-local. The accumulation of many
stellar-mass black holes (BHs) embedded in AGN gas eventually displaces radiation, winds and supernovae
from massive stars as the dominant feedback source. The delay inherent in BH formation as well as
their subsequent migration causes local heating rates to have little correlation with local star
formation rates. The non-locality of feedback heating, in combination with the need for heat to
efficiently mix throughout the gas, gives rise to steady-state AGN solutions that can have Q>>1
and no ongoing star formation. We explore the implications of our two-fluid disk models for the evolution
of compact object populations embedded in AGN disks, and find self-consistent steady state solutions
in much of the parameter space of AGN mass and accretion rate. These solutions harbor large populations
of embedded compact objects which may grow in mass by factors of a few over the AGN lifetime, including
into the lower and upper mass gaps. These feedback-dominated AGN disks differ significantly in
structure from commonly used 1D disk models, which has broad implications for gravitational wave
source formation inside AGN.

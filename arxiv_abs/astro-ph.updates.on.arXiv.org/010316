Black-holes are known to span at least 9 orders of magnitude in mass: from the stellar-mass objects
observed by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory Scientific Collaboration
and Virgo Collaboration, to supermassive black-holes like the one observed by the Event Horizon
Telescope at the heart of M87. Regardless of the mass scale, all of these objects are expected to form
binaries and eventually emit observable gravitational radiation, with more massive objects emitting
at ever lower gravitational-wave frequencies. We present the tool, gwent, for modelling the sensitivities
of current and future generations of gravitational wave detectors across the entire gravitational-wave
spectrum of coalescing black-hole binaries. We provide methods to generate sensitivity curves
for pulsar timing arrays (PTAs) using a novel realistic PTA sensitivity curve generator, space-based
interferometers using adaptive models that can represent a wide range of proposed detector designs,
and ground-based interferometers using realistic noise models that can reproduce current, second,
and third generation designs, as well as novel variations of the essential design parameters. To
model the signal from black-hole binaries at any mass scale, we use phenomenological waveforms
capable of modelling the inspiral, merger, and ringdown for sources with varying mass ratios and
spins. Using this adaptable framework, we produce signal-to-noise ratios for the combination
of any modelled parameter, associated with either the detector or the source. By allowing variation
across each detector and source parameter, we can pinpoint the most important factors to determining
the optimal performance for particular instrument designs. The adaptability of our detector and
signal models can easily be extended to new detector designs and other models of gravitational wave
signals.

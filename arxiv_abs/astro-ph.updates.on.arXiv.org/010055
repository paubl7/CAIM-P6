For terrestrial exoplanets with thin atmospheres or no atmospheres, the surface contributes light
to the reflected light signal of the planet. Measurement of the variety of disk-integrated brightnesses
of bodies in the Solar System and the variation with illumination and wavelength is essential for
both planning imaging observations of directly imaged exoplanets and interpreting the eventual
datasets. Here we measure the change in brightness of the Galilean satellites as a function of planetocentric
longitude, illumination phase angle, and wavelength. The data span a range of wavelengths from
400-950nm and predominantly phase angles from 0-25 degrees, with some constraining observations
near 60-140 degrees. Despite the similarity in size and density between the moons, surface inhomogeneities
result in significant changes in the disk-integrated reflectivity with planetocentric longitude
and phase angle. We find that these changes are sufficient to determine the rotational periods of
the moon. We also find that at low phase angles the surface can produce reflectivity variations of
8-36% and the limited high phase angle observations suggest variations will have proportionally
larger amplitudes at higher phase angles. Additionally, all the Galilean satellites are darker
than predicted by an idealized Lambertian model at the phases most likely to be observed by direct-imaging
missions. If Earth-size exoplanets have surfaces similar to that of the Galilean moons, we find
that future direct imaging missions will need to achieve precisions of less than 0.1\,ppb. Should
the necessary precision be achieved, future exoplanet observations could exploit similar observation
schemes to deduce surface variations, determine rotation periods, and potentially infer surface
composition.

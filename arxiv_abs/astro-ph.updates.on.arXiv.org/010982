Turbulent gas motions are observed in the intracluster medium (ICM). The ICM is density-stratified,
with the gas density being highest at the centre of the cluster and decreasing radially outwards.
As a result of this, Kolmogorov (homogeneous, isotropic) turbulence theory does not apply to the
ICM. The gas motions are instead explained by anisotropic stratified turbulence, with the stratification
quantified by the perpendicular Froude number ($\mathrm{Fr}_\perp$). These turbulent motions
are associated with density and pressure fluctuations, which manifest as perturbations in X-ray
surface brightness maps of the ICM and as thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect (SZ) fluctuations,
respectively. In order to advance our understanding of the relations between these fluctuations
and the turbulent gas velocities, we have conducted 100 high-resolution hydrodynamic simulations
of stratified turbulence ($256^2\times 384$ -- $1024^2\times1536$ resolution elements), in
which we scan the parameter space of subsonic rms Mach number ($\mathcal{M}$), $\mathrm{Fr}_\perp$,
and the ratio of entropy and pressure scale heights ($R_{PS}=H_P/H_S$), relevant to the ICM. We
develop a new scaling relation between the standard deviation of logarithmic density fluctuations
($\sigma_s$, where $s=\ln(\rho/\left<\rho\right>)$), $\mathcal{M}$, and $\mathrm{Fr}_{\perp}$,
valid till $\mathrm{Fr}_\perp\ll1$:~$\sigma_s^2=\ln\left(1+b^2\mathcal{M}^4+0.10/(\mathrm{Fr}_\perp+0.25/\sqrt{\mathrm{Fr}_\perp})^2\mathcal{M}^2R_{PS}\right)$,
where $b\sim1/3$ for solenoidal turbulence driving studied here. We further find that logarithmic
pressure fluctuations $\sigma_{(\ln{P}/\left<P\right>)}$ are independent of stratification
and scale according to the relation $\sigma_{(\ln{\bar{P}})}^2=\ln\left(1+b^2\gamma^2\mathcal{M}^4\right)$,
where $\bar{P}=P/\left<P\right>$ and $\gamma$ is the adiabatic index of the gas.

Magnetic bright points on the solar photosphere mark the footpoints of kilogauss magnetic flux
tubes extending toward the corona. Convective buffeting of these tubes is believed to excite MHD
waves, which can propagate to the corona and deposit heat. Measuring wave excitation via bright-point
motion can thus constrain coronal and heliospheric models. This has been done extensively with
centroid tracking to estimate kink-mode wave excitation. DKIST will be the first telescope to resolve
well the shapes and sizes of bright points, which can probe wave modes that have been difficult or
impossible to study to date. I develop two complementary ways to take the first step in such an investigation,
which I demonstrate on MURaM-simulated images of DKIST-like resolution as a proof-of-concept
in preparation for future observations. I show that these additional wave modes may double the energy
budget of this wave-heating model. I also investigate the convection driving bright-point motion.
I use a simplified model of granulation alongside MURaM to explore how bright-point motion depends
on convective properties, and I show the importance of turbulence to high-frequency motion. Separately,
I investigate high-frequency, stochastic brightness fluctuations ("flicker" or $F_8$) in Kepler
light curves, which are the signature of stellar convection. I confront a physical model of flicker
with measured values across the H-R diagram. I improve the model's agreement with observations
by including the effect of the Kepler bandpass on measured flicker, including metallicity in determining
convective Mach numbers, and using scaling relations from a wider set of numerical simulations.
I also explore how future research could improve the model. In doing so, I help to establish flicker
as a stellar constraint on convective simulations, which may support future advances in both stellar
and solar convection.

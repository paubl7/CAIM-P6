Context. Diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) is the most promising mechanism to accelerate Galactic
cosmic rays (CRs) in the shocks of supernova remnants (SNRs). The turbulence upstream is supposedly
generated by the CRs, but this process is not well understood. The dominant mechanism may depend
on the evolutionary state of the shock and can be studied via the CRs escaping upstream into the interstellar
medium (ISM). Aims. Previous observations of the $\gamma$-Cygni SNR showed a difference in morphology
between GeV and TeV energies. Since this SNR has the right age and is at the evolutionary stage for
a significant fraction of CRs to escape, we aim to understand $\gamma$-ray emission in the vicinity
of the $\gamma$-Cygni SNR. Methods. We observed the region of the $\gamma$-Cygni SNR with the MAGIC
Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes between May 2015 and September 2017 recording 87 h of
good-quality data. Additionally we analysed Fermi-LAT data to study the energy dependence of the
morphology as well as the energy spectrum in the GeV to TeV range. The energy spectra and morphology
were compared against theoretical predictions, which include a detailed derivation of the CR escape
process and their $\gamma$-ray generation. Results. The MAGIC and Fermi-LAT data allowed us to
identify three emission regions, which can be associated with the SNR and dominate at different
energies. Our hadronic emission model accounts well for the morphology and energy spectrum of all
source components. It constrains the time-dependence of the maximum energy of the CRs at the shock,
the time-dependence of the level of turbulence, and the diffusion coefficient immediately outside
the SNR shock. While in agreement with the standard picture of DSA, the time-dependence of the maximum
energy was found to be steeper than predicted and the level of turbulence was found to change over
the lifetime of the SNR.

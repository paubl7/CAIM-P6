Radiative efficiencies of QSOs and its distribution encode rich information on the evolution of
both masses and spins of massive black holes (MBHs) across cosmic time. In this paper, we develop
a maximum likelihood method to statistically extract the intrinsic relation between radiative
efficiency ($\epsilon$) and mass ($M_{\bullet}$) of QSOs from their distribution on the luminosity-(empirically
estimated virial) mass plane. By using mock samples, we find that strong constraint can be put on
the $\epsilon-M_{\bullet}$ relation at redshift $z\lesssim 0.4$ from uniform QSO samples similar
to those in Sloan Digital Sky Survey, and from QSO samples at $z \sim 0.6$ (or $\lesssim 1.0$) if the
magnitude limit of the survey can be $\sim 1-2$ (or $2-3$) magnitude deeper. Applying this method
to the SDSS DR7 QSOs with $z\lesssim 0.7$, we find $\epsilon \propto M_{\bullet}^{0\sim 1.1}$ (or
$\epsilon \propto M_{\bullet}^{-1.0\sim 0}$) correlation for QSOs with the masses obtained according
to the H$\beta$ (or Mg II) empirical mass estimator. These contradictory results may be due to the
unknown systematic errors in the two mass estimators, preventing an accurate constraint on the
$\epsilon-M_{\bullet}$ relation by using current available QSO samples. We find that both the
estimates of MBH mass and Eddington ratio distribution functions can be affected by the $\epsilon-M_\bullet$
relation, suggesting that the determination of this relation is important for understanding the
accretion and growth history of MBHs. In future, the intrinsic $\epsilon-M_{\bullet}$ relation
is expected to be strongly constrained by using QSO samples obtained from surveys deeper than SDSS
if the host galaxy contamination and systematic errors of the mass estimator(s) can be well modeled
or removed.

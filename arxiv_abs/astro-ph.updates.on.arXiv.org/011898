The triboelectric effect broadly includes any process in which force applied at a boundary layer
results in displacement of surface charge, leading to the generation of an electrostatic potential.
Wind blowing over granular surfaces, such as snow, can induce a potential difference, with subsequent
coronal discharge. Nanosecond timescale discharges can lead to radio-frequency emissions with
characteristics similar to piezoelectric-induced discharges. For Antarctic-sited experiments
seeking detection of radio-frequency signals generated by collisions of cosmic rays or neutrinos
with atmospheric or englacial molecular targets, triboelectric emissions from the surface pose
a potential background. This is particularly true for experiments in which radio antennas are buried
~(1--100) m below the snow surface, and seeking to validate neutrino detection strategies by measurement
of down-coming radio-frequency emissions from extensive air showers. Herein, after summarizing
extant evidence for wind-induced triboelectric effects previously reported elsewhere, we detail
additional analysis using archival data collected with the RICE and AURA experiments at the South
Pole. We broadly characterize those radio-frequency emissions based on source location, and time-domain
and also frequency-domain characteristics. We find that: a) For wind velocities in excess of 10-12
m/s, triboelectric background triggers can dominate data-taking, b) frequency spectra for triboelectric
events are generally shifted to the low-end of the regime to which current radio experiments are
typically sensitive (100-200 MHz), c) there is an apparent preference for tribo-electric discharges
from metal surface structures, consistent with a model in which localized, above-surface structures
provide a repository for transported charge.

Black hole (BH) triples represent one of the astrophysical pathways for BH mergers in the Universe
detectable by LIGO and VIRGO. We study the formation of BH triples via binary-binary encounters
in dense clusters, showing that up two-third of triples formed through this channel are hierarchical
whereas the remaining are in a non-hierarchical, unstable configuration. We build a database of
$32,000$ $N$-body simulations to investigate the evolution of BH triples focusing on mildly hierarchical
and non-hierarchical unstable configurations. Varying the mutual orbital inclination, the BH
masses and the inner and outer eccentricities, we show that retrograde, nearly planar configurations
lead to a significant shrinkage of the inner binary. We find a universal trend of triple systems,
namely that they tend to evolve toward prograde configurations and that the orbital flip, driven
by the torque exerted on the inner BH binary (BHB) by the outer BH, leads in general to tighter inner
orbits. In some cases, the resulting BHB undergoes coalescence within a Hubble time, releasing
gravitational waves (GWs). A large fraction of merging BHBs with initial separation $1$ AU enter
the $10^{-3}-10^{-1}$ Hz frequency band with large eccentricities, thus representing potential
eccentric LISA sources. Mergers originating from initially tighter BHB ($a\sim 0.01$ AU), instead,
often have eccentricities above 0.7 in the $1$ Hz band. We find that the mergers' mass distribution
in this astrophysical channel maps the original BH binary spectrum. This might imply that eccentric
sources detected in high-frequency detectors are most likely connected with a high-velocity dispersion
stellar environment, whereas eccentric sources detected in low-frequency detectors are likely
to develop in low-density clusters. (abridged)

Observations suggest that protoplanetary disks have moderate accretion rates onto the central
young star, especially at early stages (e.g. HL Tau), indicating moderate disk turbulence. However,
recent ALMA observations suggest that dust is highly settled, implying weak turbulence. Motivated
by such tension, we carry out 3D stratified local simulations of self-gravitating disks, focusing
on settling of dust particles in actively accreting disks. We find that gravitationally unstable
disks can have moderately high accretion rates while maintaining a relatively thin dust disk for
two reasons. First, accretion stress from the self-gravitating spirals (self-gravity stress)
can be stronger than the stress from turbulence (Reynolds stress) by a factor of 5-20. Thus, the dust
scale height is much less than that predicted by assuming all accretion is due to turbulence. Second,
the strong gravity from the gas to the dust decreases the dust scale height by another factor of $\sim
2$. Furthermore, the turbulence is slightly anisotropic, producing a larger Reynolds stress than
the vertical dust diffusion coefficient. Thus, gravitoturbulent disks have unusually high vertical
Schmidt numbers ($Sc_z$) if we scale the total accretion stress with the vertical diffusion coefficient
(e.g. $Sc_z\sim$ 10-100). The reduction of the dust scale height by the gas gravity, should also
operate in gravitationally stable disks ($Q>$1). Gravitational forces between particles become
more relevant for the concentration of intermediate dust sizes, forming dense clouds of dust. After
comparing with HL Tau observations, our results suggest that self-gravity and gravity among different
disk components could be crucial for solving the conflict between the protoplanetary disk accretion
and dust settling, at least at the early stages.

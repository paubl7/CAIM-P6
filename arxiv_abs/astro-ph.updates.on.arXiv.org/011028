[Abridged] We investigate the nature of the relations between black hole (BH) mass ($M_{\rm BH}$)
and the central velocity dispersion ($\sigma$) and, for core-S\'ersic galaxies, the size of the
depleted core ($R_{\rm b}$). Our sample of 144 galaxies with dynamically determined $M_{\rm BH}$
encompasses 24 core-S\'ersic galaxies, thought to be products of gas-poor mergers, and reliably
identified based on high-resolution HST imaging. For core-S\'ersic galaxies -- i.e., combining
normal-core ($R_{\rm b} < 0.5 $ kpc) and large-core galaxies ($R_{\rm b} \gtrsim 0.5$ kpc), we find
that $M_{\rm BH}$ correlates remarkably well with $R_{\rm b}$ such that $M_{\rm BH} \propto R_{\rm
b}^{1.20 \pm 0.14}$ (rms scatter in log $M_{\rm BH}$ of $\Delta_{\rm rms} \sim 0.29$ dex), confirming
previous works on the same galaxies except three new ones. Separating the sample into S\'ersic,
normal-core and large-core galaxies, we find that S\'ersic and normal-core galaxies jointly define
a single log-linear $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relation $M_{\rm BH} \propto \sigma^{ 4.88 \pm 0.29}$
with $\Delta_{\rm rms} \sim 0.47$ dex, however, at the high-mass end large-core galaxies (four
with measured $M_{\rm BH}$) are offset upward from this relation by ($2.5-4) \times \sigma_{\rm
s}$, explaining the previously reported steepening of the $M_{\rm BH}-\sigma$ relation for massive
galaxies. Large-core spheroids have magnitudes $M_{V} \le -23.50$ mag, half-light radii Re $>$
10 kpc and are extremely massive $M_{*} \ge 10^{12}M_{\odot}$. Furthermore, these spheroids tend
to host ultramassive BHs ($M_{\rm BH} \ge 10^{10}M_{\odot}$) tightly connected with their $R_{\rm
b}$ rather than $\sigma$. The less popular $M_{\rm BH}-R_{\rm b}$ relation exhibits $\sim$ 62%
less scatter in log $M_{\rm BH}$ than the $M_{\rm BH}- \sigma$ relations.

The properties of galaxies at redshift $z>6$ hold the key to our understanding of the early stages
of galaxy evolution and can potentially identify the sources of the ultraviolet radiation that
give rise to the epoch of reionisation. The far-infrared cooling line of [CII] at 158$\mu$m is known
to be bright and correlate with the star formation rate (SFR) of low-redshift galaxies, and hence
is also suggested to be an important tracer of star formation and interstellar medium properties
for very high-redshift galaxies. With the aim to study the interstellar medium properties of gravitationally
lensed galaxies at $z>6$, we search for [CII] and thermal dust emission in a sample of 52 $z\sim6$
galaxies observed by the ALMA Lensing Cluster Survey (ALCS). We perform our analysis using \textsc{LineStacker},
stacking both [CII] and continuum emission. The target sample is selected from multiple catalogues,
and the sample galaxies have spectroscopic redshift or low-uncertainty photometric redshifts
($\sigma_z < 0.02$) in nine galaxy clusters. Source properties of the target galaxies are either
extracted from the literature or computed using spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting. Both
weighted-average and median stacking are used, on both the full sample and three sub-samples. Our
analyses find no detection of either [CII] or continuum. An upper limit on $L_{\rm [CII]}$ is derived,
implying that [CII] remains marginally consistent for low-SFR $z>6$ galaxies but likely is under-luminous
compared to the local $L_{\rm [CII]}$-SFR relationship. We discuss potential biases and possible
physical effects that may be the cause of the non-detection. Further, the upper limit on the dust
continuum implies that less than half of the star formation is obscured.

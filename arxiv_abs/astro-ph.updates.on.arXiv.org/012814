Aims: We investigate a new method to for obtaining the plasma parameters of solar prominences observed
in the Mgii h&k spectral lines by comparing line profiles from the IRIS satellite to a bank of profiles
computed with a one-dimensional non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (non-LTE) radiative transfer
code. Methods: Using a grid of 1007 one-dimensional non-LTE radiative transfer models we carry
out this new method to match computed spectra to observed line profiles while accounting for line
core shifts not present in the models. The prominence observations were carried out by the IRIS satellite
on 19 April 2018. Results: The prominence is very dynamic with many flows. The models are able to recover
satisfactory matches in areas of the prominence where single line profiles are observed. We recover:
mean temperatures of 6000 to 50,000K; mean pressures of 0.01 to 0.5 dyne cm$^{-2}$; column masses
of 3.7$\times10^{-8}$ to 5$\times10^{-4}$ g cm$^{-2}$; a mean electron density of 7.3$\times10^{8}$
to 1.8$\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-3}$; and an ionisation degree ${n_\text{HII}}/{n_\text{HI}}=0.03
- 4500$. The highest values for the ionisation degree are found in areas where the line of sight crosses
mostly plasma from the PCTR, correlating with high mean temperatures and correspondingly no H$\alpha$
emission. Conclusions: This new method naturally returns information on how closely the observed
and computed profiles match, allowing the user to identify areas where no satisfactory match between
models and observations can be obtained. Regions where satisfactory fits were found were more likely
to contain a model encompassing a PCTR. The line core shift can also be recovered from this new method,
and it shows a good qualitative match with that of the line core shift found by the quantile method.
This demonstrates the effectiveness of the approach to line core shifts in the new method.

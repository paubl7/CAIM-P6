Some supernova (SN) explosions show evidence for interaction with pre-existing non-spherically
symmetric circumstellar medium (CSM) in their light curves, spectral line profiles, and polarization
signatures. To better understand the connection with binary stars and to aid in the interpretation
of observations, we perform two-dimensional axisymmetric hydrodynamic simulations where an
expanding spherical SN ejecta initialized with realistic density and velocity profiles collide
with various aspherical CSM distributions. We consider CSM in the form of a circumstellar disk,
colliding wind shells in binary stars with different orientations and distances from the SN progenitor,
and bipolar lobes representing a scaled down version of the Homunculus nebula of $\eta$~Car. We
study how our simulations map onto observables, including approximate light curves, indicative
spectral line profiles at late times, and estimates of polarization signature. We find that the
SN--CSM collision layer is composed of normal and oblique shocks, reflected waves, and other hydrodynamical
phenomena that lead to acceleration and shear instabilities. As a result, the total shock heating
power fluctuates in time, although the emerging light curve might be smooth if the shock interaction
region is deeply embedded in the SN envelope. SNe with circumstellar disks or bipolar lobes exhibit
late-time spectral line profiles symmetric with respect to the rest velocity and relatively high
polarization. In contrast, SNe with colliding wind shells naturally lead to line profiles with
asymmetric and time-evolving blue and red wings and low polarization. Given the high frequency
of binaries among massive stars, interaction of SN ejecta with a pre-existing colliding wind shell
must occur and the observed signatures could be used to characterize the binary companion.

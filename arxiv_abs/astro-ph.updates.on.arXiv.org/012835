The tilt angle of sunspot groups is crucial in the BL type dynamo. Some studies have shown that the
tilt coefficient is anti-correlated with the cycle strength. If the anti-correlation exists,
it will be shown to act as an effective nonlinearity of the BL-type dynamo to modulate the solar cycle.
However, some studies have shown that the anti-correlation has no statistical significance. We
aim to investigate the causes behind the controversial results of tilt angle studies and to establish
whether the tilt coefficient is indeed anti-correlated with the cycle strength. We first analyzed
the tilt angles from DPD. Based on the methods applied in previous studies, we took two criteria to
select the data, along with the linear and square-root functions to describe Joy's law, and three
methods to derive the tilt coefficients for cycles 21-24. This allowed us to evaluate different
methods based on comparisons of the differences among the tilt coefficients and the tilt coefficient
uncertainties. Then we utilized Monte Carlo experiments to verify the results. Finally, we extended
these methods to analyze the separate hemispheric DPD data and the tilt angle data from Kodaikanal
and Mount Wilson. The tilt angles exhibit an extremely wide scatter due to both the intrinsic mechanism
for its generation and measurement errors, for instance, the unipolar regions included in data
sets. Different methods to deal with the uncertainties are mainly responsible for the controversial
character of the previous results. The linear fit to the tilt-latitude relation of sunspot groups
with $\Delta s>2.5$ of a cycle carried out without binning the data can minimize the effect of the
tilt scatter on the uncertainty of the tilt coefficient. Based on this method the tilt angle coefficient
is anti-correlated with the cycle strength with strong statistical significance.

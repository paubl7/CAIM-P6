New star cluster candidates projected toward the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds (L/SMC) have
been recently discovered from relatively deep imaging surveys. We here conduct a sound analysis
of 24 star cluster candidates located in the outer regions of the L/SMC using PSF photometry produced
by the Survey of the Magellanic Stellar History. With only one exception, the studied objects resulted
to be genuine stellar aggregates. We conclude on their physical reality once their observed color-magnitude
diagrams (CMDs) were statistically decontaminated by the presence of field stars, and the resulting
cleaned CMDs for stars with assigned membership probabilities higher than 50\% were compared with
synthetic CMDs generated for thousand combinations of ages, distances, metallicities, star cluster
mass and binary fractions. The parameter of the best-matched synthetic CMDs obtained from a likelihood
approach were adopted as the star cluster astrophysical properties. The present star cluster sample
spans a wide range of distances, from those star clusters located in front of the LMC, to those along
the onset of the Magellanic Bridge, up to those behind the SMC. Their ages reveal different formation
episodes that took place along the galaxy formation and others as a consequence of the galaxy interactions.
From their estimated metallicities and ages, we speculate with the possibility that relatively
metal-deficient gaseous flows have existed between these galaxies during nearly the last one Gyr
(log(age /yr) $\approx$ 9.0), that made possible the formation of young star clusters in the galaxy
peripheries. Despide the L/SMC interactions, the studied star clusters are similar or more massive
than their counterparts in the Milky Way, which suggests that tidal effects are relatively more
important in our Galaxy.

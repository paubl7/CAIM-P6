We investigate the stellar populations for a sample of 161 massive, mainly quiescent galaxies at
$\langle z_{\rm obs} \rangle=0.8$ with deep Keck/DEIMOS rest-frame optical spectroscopy (HALO7D
survey). With the fully Bayesian framework Prospector, we simultaneously fit the spectroscopic
and photometric data with an advanced physical model (including non-parametric star-formation
histories, emission lines, variable dust attenuation law, and dust and AGN emission) together
with an uncertainty and outlier model. We show that both spectroscopy and photometry are needed
to break the dust-age-metallicity degeneracy. We find a large diversity of star-formation histories:
although the most massive ($M_{\star}>2\times10^{11}~M_{\odot}$) galaxies formed the earliest
(formation redshift of $z_{\rm f}\approx5-10$ with a short star-formation timescale of $\tau_{\rm
SF}\lesssim1~\mathrm{Gyr}$), lower-mass galaxies have a wide range of formation redshifts,
leading to only a weak trend of $z_{\rm f}$ with $M_{\star}$. Interestingly, several low-mass galaxies
with have formation redshifts of $z_{\rm f}\approx5-8$. Star-forming galaxies evolve about the
star-forming main sequence, crossing the ridgeline several times in their past. Quiescent galaxies
show a wide range and continuous distribution of quenching timescales ($\tau_{\rm quench}\approx0-5~\mathrm{Gyr}$)
with a median of $\langle\tau_{\rm quench}\rangle=1.0_{-0.9}^{+0.8}~\mathrm{Gyr}$ and of
quenching epochs of $z_{\rm quench}\approx0.8-5.0$ ($\langle z_{\rm quench}\rangle=1.3_{-0.4}^{+0.7}$).
This large diversity of quenching timescales and epochs points toward a combination of internal
and external quenching mechanisms. In our sample, rejuvenation and "late bloomers" are uncommon.
In summary, our analysis supports the "grow & quench" framework and is consistent with a wide and
continuously-populated diversity of quenching timescales.

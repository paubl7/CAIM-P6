We explore the stellar mass density and colour profiles of 118 low redshift, massive, central galaxies,
selected to have assembled 90 percent of their stellar mass 6 Gyr ago, finding evidence of the minor
merger activity expected to be the driver behind the size growth of quiescent galaxies. We use imaging
data in the $g, r, i, z, y$ bands from the Subaru Hyper Suprime-Cam survey and perform SED fitting to
construct spatially well-resolved radial profiles in colour and stellar mass surface density.
Our visual morphological classification reveals that $\sim 42$ percent of our sample displays
tidal features, similar to previous studies, $\sim 43$ percent of the remaining sample display
a diffuse stellar halo and only $\sim 14$ percent display no features, down to a limiting $\mu_{r\mathrm{-band}}$
$\sim$ 28 mag arcsec$^{-2}$. We find good agreement between the stacked colour profiles of our sample
to those derived from previous studies and an expected smooth, declining stellar mass surface density
profile in the central regions (< 3 R$_{\mathrm{e}}$). However, we also see a flattening of the profile
($\Sigma_* \sim 10^{7.5}$ M$_\odot$ kpc$^{-2}$) in the outskirts (up to 10 R$_{\mathrm{e}}$),
which is revealed by our method of specifically targeting tidal/accretion features. We find similar
levels of tidal features and behaviour in the stellar mass surface density profiles in a younger
comparison sample, however a lack of diffuse haloes. We also apply stacking techniques, similar
to those in previous studies, finding such procedures wash out tidal features and thereby produces
smooth declining profiles. The stellar material in the outskirts contributes on average $\sim
10^{10}$ M$_\odot$ or a few percent of the total stellar mass and has similar colours to SDSS satellites
of similar stellar mass.

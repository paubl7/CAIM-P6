The isotopic ratio of nitrogen presents a wide range of values in the Solar System and in star forming
system whose origin is still unclear. Chemical reactions in the gas phase are one of the possible
processes that could modify the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio. We aim at investigating if and how the
passage of a shock wave in the interstellar medium, can affect the relative fraction of nitrogen
isotopes. The ideal place for such a study is the L1157 outflow, where several shocked clumps are
present. We present the first measurement of the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio in the two shocked clumps,
B1 and B0, of the protostellar outflow L1157, derived from the interferomteric maps of the H$^{13}$CN(1-0)
and the HC$^{15}$N(1-0) lines. In B1, we find that the H$^{13}$CN(1-0) and HC$^{15}$N(1-0) emission
traces the front of the clump, with averaged column density of $N$(H$^{13}$CN) $\sim$ 7$\times$10$^{12}$
cm$^{-2}$ and $N$(HC$^{15}$N) $\sim$ 2$\times$10$^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$. In this region the ratio
H$^{13}$CN(1-0)/HC$^{15}$N(1-0) is quite uniform with an average value of $\sim$ 5$\pm$1. The
same average value is also measured in the smaller clump B0e. Assuming the standard $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C
= 68, we obtain $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N = 340$\pm$70, similar to those usually found in prestellar cores
and protostars. We analysed the prediction of a chemical shock model for several shock conditions
and we found that the nitrogen and carbon fractionations do not vary much for the first period after
the shock. The observed H$^{13}$CN/HC$^{15}$N can be reproduced by a non-dissociative, C-type
shock with parameters in agreement with previous modelling of L1157-B1. Both observations and
chemical models indicate that the shock propagation does not affect the nitrogen isotopic ratio
that remains similar to that measured in lower temperature gas in prestellar cores and in protostellar
envelopes.

High-redshift star-forming galaxies have very different morphologies compared to nearby ones.
Indeed, they are often dominated by bright star-forming structures of masses up to $10^{8-9}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$
dubbed {\guillemotleft}giant clumps{\guillemotright}. However, recent observations questioned
this result by showing only low-mass structures or no structure at all. We use Adaptative Mesh Refinement
hydrodynamical simulations of galaxies with parsec-scale resolution to study the formation of
structures inside clumpy high-redshift galaxies. We show that in very gas-rich galaxies star formation
occurs in small gas clusters with masses below $10^{7-8}$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$ that are themselves
located inside giant complexes with masses up to $10^8$ and sometimes $10^9$ $\mathrm{M}_\odot$.
Those massive structures are similar in mass and size to the giant clumps observed in imaging surveys,
in particular with the Hubble Space Telescope. Using mock observations of simulated galaxies,
we show that at very high resolution with instruments like the Atacama Large Millimeter Array or
through gravitational lensing, only low-mass structures are likely to be detected, and their gathering
into giant complexes might be missed. This leads to the non-detection of the giant clumps and therefore
introduces a bias in the detection of these structures. We show that the simulated giant clumps can
be gravitationally bound even when undetected in mocks representative for ALMA observations and
HST observations of lensed galaxies. We then compare the top-down fragmentation of an initially
warm disc and the bottom-up fragmentation of an initially cold disc to show that the process of formation
of the clumps does not impact their physical properties.

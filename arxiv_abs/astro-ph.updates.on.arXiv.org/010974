Accounting for the effects of stellar magnetic phenomena is indispensable to fully exploit radial
velocities (RVs). Correlated time variations are often mitigated by Gaussian processes (GP).
They rely on fitting kernel functions that are motivated on mathematical grounds, and whose physical
interpretation is often elusive. We aim to establish a connection between stellar activity affecting
RVs and their correlations with physical parameters, and compare this connection with kernels
used in the literature. We use simple activity models to investigate the relationship between the
physical processes generating the signals and the covariances typically found in data, and to demonstrate
the qualitative behaviour of this relationship. We use the StarSim code to calculate RVs of an M dwarf
with different realistic evolving spot configurations. Their auto-correlation functions (ACF)
show a very specific behaviour and are related to the kernel. GP regression is performed using a quasi-periodic
(QP) and harmonic oscillator kernels. Comparison of the resulting kernels with the exact ACFs allows
us to cross-match the kernel hyper-parameters with the introduced physical values, study the overall
capabilities of the kernels, and improve their definition. We find that the QP kernel provides a
more straightforward interpretation of the physics. It is able to consistently recover both the
introduced rotation period P and the spot lifetime. Our study indicates that the performance can
be enhanced by fixing the form factor w and adding a physically motivated cosine term with period
P/2, where the contribution to the ACF for the different spot configurations differs significantly.
The new quasi-periodic with cosine kernel leads to significantly better model likelihoods, can
potentially distinguish between different spot configurations, and can thereby improve the sensitivity
of RV exoplanet searches.

Two groups of astronomers used large telescopes Keck and VLT for decades to observe trajectories
of bright stars near the Galactic Centre. Based on results of their observations astronomers concluded
that trajectories of the stars are roughly elliptical and foci of the orbits are approximately coincide
with the Galactic Centre position. It gives an opportunity to claim that the Newtonian potential
of point like mass around $4.3\times 10^6 M_\odot$ is a good initial approximation for the gravitational
potential near the Galactic Centre. In the last years, the astronomers found that gravitational
redshift of S2 star near pericenter passage in May 2018 is in accordance with general relativity
predictions. In 2020 the GRAVITY team found that the observed relativistic precession of S2 star
orbit is also consistent with theoretical estimates calculated for a weak gravitational field
approximation in a Schwarzschild black hole. In last years a a self-gravitating dark matter core--halo
distribution suggested by Ruffini, Arguelles and Rueda (MNRAS, 2015) (RAR model) was proposed
and recently Becerra-Vergara et al. (MNRAS, 2021) claimed that this model provides a better fit
of trajectories of bright stars in comparison with the conventional model with the supermassive
black hole. We confirm that in the case of this dark matter distribution model for a dense core trajectories
of test bodies are elliptical but in this case centers (not foci) of these ellipses should coincide
with the Galactic Centre and orbital periods do not depend on semi-major axis and it contradicts
observational data and therefore, we concluded supermassive black hole is a preferable model in
comparison with the a dense core--diluted halo density profile for the Galactic Centre.

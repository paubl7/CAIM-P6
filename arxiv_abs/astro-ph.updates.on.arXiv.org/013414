The column density of free electrons with a cosmological-scale depth, cosmic dispersion measures
(DMs), is among the most interesting observables in future transient surveys at radio wavelengths.
For future surveys of fast radio bursts (FRBs), we clarify information available from cosmic DMs
through cross-correlation analyses of foreground dark matter haloes (hosting galaxies and galaxy
clusters) with their known redshifts. With a halo-model approach, we predict that the cross-correlation
with cluster-sized haloes is less affected by the details of gastrophysics, providing robust cosmological
information. For less massive haloes, the cross-correlation at angular scales of $<10\, \mathrm{arcmin}$
is sensitive to gas expelled from the halo centre due to galactic feedback. Assuming $20000$ FRBs
over $20000 \, {\rm deg}^2$ with a localisation error being 3 arcmin, we expect that the cross-correlation
signal at halo masses of $10^{12}$-$10^{14}\, M_\odot$ can be measured with a level of $\sim 1\%$
precision in a redshift range of $0<z<1$. Such precise measurements enable to put a $1.5\%$ level
constraint on $\sigma_8\, (\Omega_\mathrm{M}/0.3)^{0.5}$ and a $3\%$ level constraint on $(\Omega_\mathrm{b}/0.049)(h/0.67)(f_\mathrm{e}/0.95)$
($\sigma_8$, $\Omega_\mathrm{M}$, $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$, $h$ and $f_\mathrm{e}$ are the linear
mass variance smoothed at $8\, h^{-1}\mathrm{Mpc}$, mean mass density, mean baryon density, the
present-day Hubble parameter and fraction of free electrons in cosmic baryons today), whereas
the gas-to-halo mass relation in galaxies and clusters can be constrained with a level of $10\%$-$20\%$.
Furthermore the cross-correlation analyses can break the degeneracy among $\Omega_\mathrm{b}$,
$h$ and $f_\mathrm{e}$, inherent in the DM-redshift relation.

During the last decade in star formation research, many studies have targeted low- and high-mass
star formation regions located at different distances, with different telescopes having specific
angular resolution capabilities. We present a systematic investigation of the angular resolution
effects, with special attention being paid to the derived masses of sources as well as the shape of
the resulting source mass functions (SMFs). We tested the impact of angular resolution, from 0.6
down to 0.02 pc, in two star-forming regions observed with Herschel (NGC6334 and Aquila), and three
(magneto)-hydrodynamical simulations. We detected and measured sources at each resolution using
getsf and we analysed the derived masses and sizes of the sources. We find that the number of sources
does not converge from 0.6 to 0.05 pc. It increases by about two when the angular resolution increases
with a similar factor. Below 0.05 pc, the number of source still increases by about 1.3 when the angular
resolution increases by two, suggesting that we are close to, but not yet at, convergence. We find
that the measured sizes and masses of sources linearly depend on the angular resolution with no sign
of convergence to a resolution-independent value. The corresponding SMF peak also shifts with
angular resolution, while the slope of the high-mass tail of the SMFs remains almost invariant.
If prestellar cores, physically distinct from their background, exist in cluster-forming molecular
clouds, we conclude that their mass must be lower than reported so far in the literature. We discuss
various implications for the studies of star formation: the problem of determining the mass reservoirs
involved in the star-formation process; the inapplicability of the Gaussian beam deconvolution
to infer source sizes; and the impossibility to determine the efficiency of the mass conversion
from the cores to the stars.

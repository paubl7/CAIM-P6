Diffuse cluster radio sources, in the form of radio halos and relics, reveal the presence of cosmic
rays and magnetic fields in the intracluster medium (ICM). These cosmic rays are thought to be (re-)accelerated
through ICM turbulence and shock waves generated by cluster merger events. Here we characterize
the presence of diffuse radio emission in known galaxy clusters in the HETDEX Spring Field, covering
424 deg$^2$. For this, we developed a method to extract individual targets from LOFAR observations
processed with the LoTSS DDF-pipeline. This procedure enables improved calibration and joint
imaging and deconvolution of multiple pointings of selected targets. The calibration strategy
can also be used for LOFAR Low-Band Antenna (LBA) and international-baseline observations. The
fraction of Planck PSZ2 clusters with any diffuse radio emission apparently associated with the
ICM is $73\pm17\%$. We detect a total of 10 radio halos and 12 candidate halos in the HETDEX Spring
Field. Five clusters host radio relics. The fraction of radio halos in Planck PSZ2 clusters is $31\pm11\%$,
and $62\pm15\%$ when including the candidate radio halos. Based on these numbers, we expect that
there will be at least $183 \pm 65$ radio halos found in the LoTSS survey in PSZ2 clusters, in agreement
with predictions. The integrated flux densities for the radio halos were computed by fitting exponential
models to the radio images. From these flux densities, we determine the cluster mass (M$_{500}$)
and Compton Y parameter (Y$_{500}$) 150 MHz radio power (P$_{\rm{150 MHz}}$) scaling relations
for Planck PSZ2-detected radio halos. We find that the slopes of these relations are steeper than
those determined from the 1.4 GHz radio powers. However, considering the uncertainties this is
not a statistically significant result.

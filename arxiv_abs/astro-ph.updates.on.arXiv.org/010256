We study quark-hadron hybrid stars with sharp phase transitions assuming that phase conversions
at the interface are slow. Hadronic matter is described by a set of equations of state (EoS) based
on the chiral effective field theory and quark matter by a generic bag model. Due to slow conversions
at the interface, there is an extended region of stable hybrid stars with central densities above
the density of the maximum mass star. We explore systematically the role of the transition pressure
and the energy-density jump $\Delta \epsilon$ at the interface on some global properties of hybrid
stars. We find that for a given transition pressure, the radius of the last stable hybrid star decreases
as $\Delta \epsilon$ raises resulting in a larger extended branch of stable hybrid stars. Contrary
to purely hadronic stars, the tidal deformability $\Lambda$ can be either a decreasing or an increasing
function of the stellar mass $M$ and for large values of the transition pressure has a very weak dependence
on $M$. Finally, we analyze the tidal deformabilities $\Lambda_1$ and $\Lambda_2$ for a binary
system with the same chirp mass as GW170817. In the scenario where at least one of the stars in the binary
is hybrid, we find that models with low enough transition pressure are inside the $90 \%$ credible
region of GW170817. However, these models have maximum masses below $2 \, M_{\odot}$, in disagreement
with observations. We also find that the LIGO/Virgo constrain (at $90\%$ level) and the $2 \, M_{\odot}$
requirement can be simultaneously fulfilled in a scenario where all hybrid configurations have
masses larger than $1.6 \, M_{\odot}$ and the hadronic EoS is not too stiff, such as several of our
hybrid models involving a hadronic EoS of intermediate stiffness. In such scenario hybrid stars
may exist in Nature but both objects in GW170817 were hadronic stars.

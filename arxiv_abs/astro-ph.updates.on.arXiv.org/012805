We analyze VLT/MUSE observations of 37 radio galaxies from the Third Cambridge catalogue (3C) with
redshift $<$0.3 searching for nuclear outflows of ionized gas. These observations are part of the
MURALES project (a MUse RAdio Loud Emission line Snapshot survey), whose main goal is to explore
the feedback process in the most powerful radio-loud AGN. We applied a nonparametric analysis to
the [O~III] $\lambda$5007 emission line, whose asymmetries and high-velocity wings reveal signatures
of outflows. We find evidence of nuclear outflows in 21 sources, with velocities between $\sim$400
- 1000 km s$^{-1}$, outflowing masses of $\sim 10^5-10^7$ M$_\odot$, and a kinetic energy in the
range $\sim 10^{53} - 10^{56}$ erg. In addition, evidence for extended outflows is found in the 2D
gas velocity maps of 13 sources of the subclasses of high-excitation (HEG) and broad-line (BLO)
radio galaxies, with sizes between 0.4 and 20 kpc. We estimate a mass outflow rate in the range 0.4
- 30 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ and an energy deposition rate of ${\dot E}_{kin} \sim 10^{42}-10^{45}
$ erg s$^{-1}$. Comparing the jet power, the nuclear luminosity of the active galactic nucleus,
and the outflow kinetic energy rate, we find that outflows of HEGs and BLOs are likely radiatively
powered, while jets likely only play a dominant role in galaxies with low excitation. The low loading
factors we measured suggest that these outflows are driven by momentum and not by energy. Based on
the gas masses, velocities, and energetics involved, we conclude that the observed ionized outflows
have a limited effect on the gas content or the star formation in the host. In order to obtain a complete
view of the feedback process, observations exploring the complex multiphase structure of outflows
are required.

One of the last unexplored windows to the cosmos, the Dark Ages and Cosmic Dawn, can be opened using
a simple low frequency radio telescope from the stable, quiet lunar farside to measure the Global
21-cm spectrum. This frontier remains an enormous gap in our knowledge of the Universe. Standard
models of physics and cosmology are untested during this critical epoch. The messenger of information
about this period is the 1420 MHz (21-cm) radiation from the hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen,
Doppler-shifted to low radio astronomy frequencies by the expansion of the Universe. The Global
21-cm spectrum uniquely probes the cosmological model during the Dark Ages plus the evolving astrophysics
during Cosmic Dawn, yielding constraints on the first stars, on accreting black holes, and on exotic
physics such as dark matter-baryon interactions. A single low frequency radio telescope can measure
the Global spectrum between ~10-110 MHz because of the ubiquity of neutral hydrogen. Precise characterizations
of the telescope and its surroundings are required to detect this weak, isotropic emission of hydrogen
amidst the bright foreground Galactic radiation. We describe how two antennas will permit observations
over the full frequency band: a pair of orthogonal wire antennas and a 0.3-m$^3$ patch antenna. A
four-channel correlation spectropolarimeter forms the core of the detector electronics. Technology
challenges include advanced calibration techniques to disentangle covariances between a bright
foreground and a weak 21-cm signal, using techniques similar to those for the CMB, thermal management
for temperature swings of >250C, and efficient power to allow operations through a two-week lunar
night. This simple telescope sets the stage for a lunar farside interferometric array to measure
the Dark Ages power spectrum.

We present a large forward-modeling analysis for 55 late-T (T7-T9) dwarfs, using low-resolution
($R\approx150$) near-infrared spectra and cloudless Sonora-Bobcat model atmospheres. We derive
the objects' effective temperatures, surface gravities, metallicities, radii, masses, and luminosities
using our newly developed Bayesian framework, and use the resulting population properties to test
the model atmospheres. We find (1) our objects' fitted metallicities are 0.3-0.4 dex lower than
those of nearby stars; (2) their ages derived from spectroscopic parameters are implausibly young;
(3) their fitted temperatures show a similar spread as empirical temperature scales at a given spectral
type but are $\sim100$ K hotter for $\geqslant$T8 dwarfs; and (4) their spectroscopically inferred
masses are unphysically small. These results suggest the Sonora-Bobcat assumptions of cloudless
and chemical-equilibrium atmospheres do not adequately reproduce late-T dwarf spectra. We also
find a gravity- and a metallicity-dependence of temperatures. Combining the resulting parameter
posteriors of our sample, we quantify the degeneracy between surface gravity and metallicity such
that an increase in $Z$ combined with a $3.4\times$ increase in $\log{g}$ results in a spectrum that
has similar fitted parameters. We note the systematic difference between our 1.0-2.5 $\mu$m spectra
and the Sonora-Bobcat models is $\approx$2-4% of the objects' peak $J$-band fluxes, implying modeling
systematics will exceed measurement uncertainties when analyzing data with $J$-band S/N $\gtrsim50$.
Using our large sample, we examine the fitting residuals as a function of wavelength and atmospheric
properties to discern how to improve the models. Our work constitutes the largest analysis of brown
dwarf spectra using multi-metallicity models and the most systematic examination of ultracool
model atmospheres to date.

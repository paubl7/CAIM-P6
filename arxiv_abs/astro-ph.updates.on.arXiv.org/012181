(abridged) Within the Orion A molecular cloud, the integral-shaped filament (ISF) is a prominent,
degree-long structure of dense gas and dust, with clear signs of recent and on-going high-mass star
formation. We used the ArTeMiS bolometer camera at APEX to map a 0.6x0.2 deg^2 region covering OMC-1,
OMC-2, OMC-3 at 350 and 450 micron. We combined these data with Herschel-SPIRE maps to recover extended
emission. The combined Herschel-ArTeMiS maps provide details on the distribution of dense, cold
material, with a high spatial dynamic range, from our 8'' resolution (0.016 pc) up to the size of the
map ~10-15 deg. By combining Herschel and ArTeMiS data at 160, 250, 350 and 450 micron, we constructed
high-resolution temperature and H2 column density maps. We extracted radial profiles from the
column density map in several, representative portions of the ISF, that we fitted with Gaussian
and Plummer models to derive their intrinsic widths. We also compared the distribution of material
traced by ArTeMiS with that seen in the higher density tracer N2H+(1-0) recently observed with the
ALMA interferometer. All the radial profiles that we extracted show clear deviation from a Gaussian,
with evidence for an inner plateau, previously not seen using Herschel-only data. We measure intrinsic
half-power widths in the range 0.06 to 0.11 pc. This is significantly larger than the Gaussian widths
measured for fibers seen in N2H+, which probably traces only the dense innermost regions of the large-scale
filament. These half-power widths are within a factor of two of the value of 0.1 pc found for a large
sample of nearby filaments in various low-mass star-forming regions, which tends to indicate that
the physical conditions governing the fragmentation of prestellar cores within transcritical
or supercritical filaments are the same over a large range of masses per unit length.

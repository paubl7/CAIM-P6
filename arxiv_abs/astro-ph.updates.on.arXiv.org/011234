We used Gaia DR2 data in order to estimate parameters of the Pleiades. With the data on stars with m_G<=18
mag, we constructed the density maps and profile, luminosity and mass functions, determined the
cluster radius, 10.9+/-0.3 deg (26.3+/-0.7 pc), and the radius of its core, 2.62 deg (6.24 pc), and
obtained estimates for the number of stars in the cluster, 1542+/-121, and their mass, 855+/-104
solar mass. Distribution of stars with m_G<16 mag at distances r_s from the cluster center in three-dimensional
space of r_s<1 pc and at r_s~1.4-5 pc contains radial density waves. We determined the average `prograde'
rotation velocity of the core of the cluster v_c=0.56+/-0.07 km/s at distances d in the sky plane
d<=4.6 pc from its center. The rotation velocity of the cluster core at a distance of d~5.5 pc from
its center is close to zero: v_c=0.1+/-0.3 km/s. The velocity of the `retrograde' rotation of the
cluster at a distance of d~7.1 pc from its center is v_c=0.48+/-0.20 km/s. The dependences of moduli
of the tangential and radial components of the cluster core star velocities in the sky plane on the
distance d to the cluster center contain the periodic oscillations. The velocity dispersions of
the cluster core stars increase on average with an increase in r_s, which, like the radial density
waves and the waves of oscillations of the velocity field in the sky plane, indicates the non-stationarity
of the cluster in the regular field. The Jeans wavelength in the cluster core decreases, and the velocity
dispersion of the core stars under the Jeans instability increases after taking into account the
Galactic gravitational field. The region of gravitational instability in the Pleiades cluster
is located in the interval r_s=2.2-5.7 pc and contains 39.4-60.5% of the total number of stars in
the considered samples.

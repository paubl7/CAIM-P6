Dust polarization is a powerful tool for studying the magnetic field properties in the interstellar
medium (ISM). However, it does not provide a direct measurement of its strength. Different methods
havebeen developed which employ both polarization and spectroscopic data in order to infer the
field strength. The most widely applied methods have been developed by Davis (1951), Chandrasekhar
& Fermi (1953) (DCF), Hildebrand et al. (2009) and Houde et al.(2009) (HH09). They rely on the assumption
that isotropic turbulent motions initiate the propagation of Alvf\'en waves. Observations,however,
indicate that turbulence in the ISM is anisotropic and non-Alfv\'enic (compressible) modes may
be important. Our goal is to develop a new method for estimating the field strength in the ISM, which
includes the compressible modes and does not contradict the anisotropic properties of turbulence.
We use simple energetics arguments that take into account the compressible modes to estimate the
strength of the magnetic field. We derive the following equation: $B_{0}=\sqrt{2 \pi\rho} \delta
v /\sqrt{\delta \theta}$, where $\rho$ is the gas density, $\delta v$ is the rms velocity as derived
from the spread of emission lines, and $\delta \theta$ is the dispersion of polarization angles.
We produce synthetic observations from 3D MHD simulationsand we assess the accuracy of our method
by comparing the true field strength with the estimates derived from our equation. We find a mean
relative deviation of $17 \%$. The accuracy of our method does not depend on the turbulence properties
of the simulated model. In contrast DCF and HH09 systematically overestimate the field strength.
HH09 produces accurate results only for simulations with high sonic Mach numbers.

Based on SITELLE spectroscopy, we studied the ionised gas emission for the 175 H$\alpha$ emission
regions in the Stephan's Quintet (SQ). A detailed analysis is performed of the star formation rate
(SFR), oxygen abundance (O/H), and nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratio (N/O) of the SQ regions,
to explore the provenance and evolution of this complex structure. According to the BPT diagram,
we found 91 HII, 17 composite, and 7 active galactic nucleus-like regions in SQ. Several regions
are compatible with fast shocks models without a precursor for solar metallicity and low density
(n=0.1 cm$^{-3}$), with velocities between 175 - 300 km s$^{-1}$. We derived the total SFR in SQ (log(SFR/M$_\odot\,yr^{-1}$=0.496);
starburst A and B provide 28% and 9% of the total SFR, and 45% comes from the regions with a radial velocity
lower than 6160 km s$^{-1}$. For this reason, we assume that the material prior to the collision with
the new intruder (NI) does not show a high SFR, and therefore SQ was apparently quenched. When considering
the integrated SFR for the whole SQ and the NI, we found that both zones have a SFR consistent with those
obtained in the SDSS star-forming galaxies. At least two chemically different gas components cohabit
in SQ where, on average, the regions with high radial velocities (v$>$6160 km s$^{-1}$) have lower
values of O/H and N/O than those with low radial velocities (v$\leq$6160 km s$^{-1}$). The values
found for the line ratios, O/H, and N/O for the southern debris region and the northernmost tidal
tail, are compatible with regions belonging to the outer part of the galaxies. We highlight the presence
of inner-outer variation for O/H and some emission line ratios along the NI strands and the young
tidal tail south strand. Finally, the SQ H$\alpha$ regions are outside the galaxies because the
interactions have dispersed the gas to the peripheral zones.

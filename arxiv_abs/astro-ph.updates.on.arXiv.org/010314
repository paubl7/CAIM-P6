Milky Way globular clusters (MW GCs) are difficult to identify at low Galactic latitudes because
of high differential extinction and heavy star crowding. The new deep near-IR images and photometry
from the VISTA Variables in the Via L\'actea Extended Survey (VVVX) allow us to chart previously
unexplored regions. Our long term aim is to complete the census of MW GCs. The immediate goals are
to estimate the astrophysical parameters, measuring their reddenings, extinctions, distances,
total luminosities, proper motions, sizes, metallicities and ages. We use the near-IR VVVX survey
database, in combination with Gaia DR2 optical photometry, and with the Two Micron All Sky Survey
(2MASS) photometry. We report the detection of a heretofore unknown Galactic Globular Cluster
at $RA =$ 14:09:00.0; $DEC=-$65:37:12 (J2000). We calculate a reddening of $E(J-K_s)=(0.3\pm
0.03)$ mag and an extinction of $A_{K_s}=(0.15\pm 0.01)$ mag for this new GC. Its distance modulus
and corresponding distance were measured as $(m-M)=(15.93\pm0.03)$ mag and $D=(15.5\pm1.0)$
kpc, respectively. We estimate the metallicity and age by comparison with known GCs and by fitting
PARSEC and Dartmouth isochrones, finding $[Fe/H]=(-0.70\pm0.2)$ dex and $t=(11.0\pm1.0)$ Gyr.
The mean GC PMs from Gaia are $\mu_{\alpha^\ast}=(-4.68 \pm 0.47 )$ mas $yr^{-1}$ and $\mu_{\delta}=(-1.34
\pm 0.45)$ mas $yr^{-1}$. The total luminosity of our cluster is estimated to be $M_{Ks}=(-7.76\pm
0.5)$ mag. We have found a new low-luminosity, old and metal-rich globular cluster, situated in
the far side of the Galactic disk, at $R_{G}=11.2$ kpc from the Galactic centre, and at $z=1.0$ kpc
below the plane. Interestingly, the location, metallicity and age of this globular cluster are
coincident with the Monoceros Ring (MRi) structure.

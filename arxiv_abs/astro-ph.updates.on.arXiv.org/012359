We present a full analysis of a broadband spectral line survey of Sagittarius B2 (Main), one of the
most chemically rich regions in the Galaxy located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr
B2 in the Central Molecular Zone. Our goal is to derive the molecular abundances and temperatures
of the high-mass star-forming region Sgr B2(M) and thus its physical and astrochemical conditions.
Sgr B2(M) was observed using the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI) on board the
Herschel Space Observatory in a spectral line survey from 480 to 1907 GHz at a spectral resolution
of 1.1 MHz, which provides one of the largest spectral coverages ever obtained toward this high-mass
star-forming region in the submillimeter with high spectral resolution and includes frequencies
> 1 THz unobservable from the ground. We model the molecular emission from the submillimeter to the
far-IR using the XCLASS program. For each molecule, a quantitative description was determined
taking all emission and absorption features of that species across the entire spectral range into
account. Additionally, we derive velocity resolved ortho / para ratios for those molecules for
which ortho and para resolved molecular parameters are available. Finally, the temperature and
velocity distributions are analyzed and the derived abundances are compared with those obtained
for Sgr B2(N) from a similar HIFI survey. A total of 92 isotopologues were identified, arising from
49 different molecules, ranging from free ions to complex organic compounds and originating from
a variety of environments from the cold envelope to hot and dense gas within the cores. Sulfur dioxide,
methanol, and water are the dominant contributors. For the ortho / para ratios we find deviations
from the high temperature values between 13 and 27 %. In total 14 % of all lines remain unidentified.

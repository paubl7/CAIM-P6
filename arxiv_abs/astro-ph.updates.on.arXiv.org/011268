Transition discs are expected to be a natural outcome of the interplay between photoevaporation
(PE) and giant planet formation. Massive planets reduce the inflow of material from the outer to
the inner disc, therefore triggering an earlier onset of disc dispersal due to PE through a process
known as Planet-Induced PhotoEvaporation (PIPE). In this case, a cavity is formed as material inside
the planetary orbit is removed by PE, leaving only the outer disc to drive the migration of the giant
planet. We investigate the impact of PE on giant planet migration and focus specifically on the case
of transition discs with an evacuated cavity inside the planet location. This is important for determining
under what circumstances PE is efficient at halting the migration of giant planets, thus affecting
the final orbital distribution of a population of planets. For this purpose, we use 2D FARGO simulations
to model the migration of giant planets in a range of primordial and transition discs subject to PE.
The results are then compared to the standard prescriptions used to calculate the migration tracks
of planets in 1D planet population synthesis models. The FARGO simulations show that once the disc
inside the planet location is depleted of gas, planet migration ceases. This contradicts the results
obtained by the impulse approximation, which predicts the accelerated inward migration of planets
in discs that have been cleared inside the planetary orbit. These results suggest that the impulse
approximation may not be suitable for planets embedded in transition discs. A better approximation
that could be used in 1D models would involve halting planet migration once the material inside the
planetary orbit is depleted of gas and the surface density at the 3:2 mean motion resonance location
in the outer disc reaches a threshold value of $0.01\,\mathrm{g\,cm^{-2}}$.

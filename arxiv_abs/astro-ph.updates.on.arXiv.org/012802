We present a population of 20 radio-luminous supernovae (SNe) with emission reaching $L_{\nu}{\sim}10^{26}-10^{29}\rm{erg
s^{-1} Hz^{-1}}$ in the first epoch of the Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) at $2-4$ GHz. Our sample
includes one long Gamma-Ray Burst, SN 2017iuk/GRB171205A, and 19 core-collapse SNe detected at
$\approx (1-60)$ years after explosion. No thermonuclear explosion shows evidence for bright
radio emission, and hydrogen-poor progenitors dominate the sub-sample of core-collapse events
with spectroscopic classification at the time of explosion (73%). We interpret these findings
into the context of the expected radio emission from the forward shock interaction with the circumstellar
medium (CSM). We conclude that these observations require a departure from the single wind-like
density profile (i.e., $\rho_{\rm{CSM}}\propto r^{-2}$) that is expected around massive stars
and/or a departure from a spherical Newtonian shock. Viable alternatives include the shock interaction
with a detached, dense shell of CSM formed by a large effective progenitor mass-loss rate $\dot M
\sim (10^{-4}-10^{-1})$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ (for an assumed wind velocity of $1000\,\rm{km\,s^{-1}}$);
emission from an off-axis relativistic jet entering our line of sight; or the emergence of emission
from a newly-born pulsar-wind nebula. The relativistic SN\,2012ap that is detected 5.7 and 8.5
years after explosion with $L_{\nu}{\sim}10^{28}$ erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ might constitute the
first detections of an off-axis jet+cocoon system in a massive star. Future multi-wavelength observations
will distinguish among these scenarios. Our VLASS source catalogs, which were used to perform the
VLASS cross matching, are publicly available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4895112.

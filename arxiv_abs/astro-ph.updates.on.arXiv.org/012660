The presence of stable, compact circumbinary discs of gas and dust around post-asymptotic giant
branch (post-AGB) binary systems has been well established. We focus on one such system: IRAS 08544-4431.
We present an interferometric multi-wavelength analysis of the circumstellar environment of
IRAS 08544-4431. The aim is to constrain different contributions to the total flux in the H, K, L,
and N-bands in the radial direction. The data from VLTI/PIONIER, VLTI/GRAVITY, and VLTI/MATISSE
range from the near-infrared, where the post-AGB star dominates, to the mid-infrared, where the
disc dominates. We fitted two geometric models to the visibility data to reproduce the circumbinary
disc: a ring with a Gaussian width and a flat disc model with a temperature gradient. The flux contributions
from the disc, the primary star (modelled as a point-source), and an over-resolved component are
recovered along with the radial size of the emission, the temperature of the disc as a function of
radius, and the spectral dependencies of the different components. The trends of all visibility
data were well reproduced with the geometric models. The near-infrared data were best fitted with
a Gaussian ring model while the mid-infrared data favoured a temperature gradient model. This implies
that a vertical structure is present at the disc inner rim, which we attribute to a rounded puffed-up
inner rim. The N-to-K size ratio is 2.8, referring to a continuous flat source, analogues to young
stellar objects. By combining optical interferometric instruments operating at different wavelengths
we can resolve the complex structure of circumstellar discs and study the wavelength-dependent
opacity profile. A detailed radial, vertical, and azimuthal structural analysis awaits a radiative
transfer treatment in 3D to capture all non-radial complexity.

Flares, energetic eruptions on the surfaces of stars, are an unmistakable manifestation of magnetically
driven emission. Their occurrence rates and energy distributions trace stellar characteristics
such as mass and age. But before flares can be used to constrain stellar properties, the flaring-age-mass
relation requires proper calibration. This work sets out to quantify flaring activity of independently
age-dated main sequence stars for a broad range of spectral types using optical light curves obtained
by the Kepler satellite. Drawing from the complete K2 archive, we searched 3435 $\sim 80$ day long
light curves of 2111 open cluster members for flares using the open-source software packages K2SC
to remove instrumental and astrophysical variability from K2 light curves, and AltaiPony to search
and characterize the flare candidates. We confirmed a total of 3844 flares on high probability open
cluster members with ages from zero age main sequence (Pleiades) to 3.6 Gyr (M67). We extended the
mass range probed in the first study of this series to span from Sun-like stars to mid-M dwarfs. We
added the Hyades (690 Myr) to the sample as a comparison cluster to Praesepe (750 Myr), the 2.6 Gyr
old Ruprecht 147, and several hundred light curves from the late K2 Campaigns in the remaining clusters.
The flare energy distribution was similar in the entire parameter space, following a power law relation
with exponent $\alpha\approx 1.84-2.39$. The flaring rates declined with age, and declined faster
for higher mass stars. We found evidence that a rapid decline in flaring activity occurred in M1-M2
dwarfs around Hyades/Praesepe age, when these stars spun down to rotation periods of about 10 days,
while higher mass stars had already transitioned to lower flaring rates, and lower mass stars still
resided in the saturated activity regime. (abridged)

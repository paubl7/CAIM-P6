The large disparity in physical conditions from the diffuse interstellar medium (ISM) to denser
clouds such as photon-dominated regions (PDRs) triggers an evolution of the dust properties (i.e.
composition, size, and shape). The gas physics and chemistry are tightly connected to these dust
properties and are therefore affected by dust evolution and especially the nano-grain depletion
in the outer irradiated part of PDRs. We highlight the influence of nano-grain depletion on the gas
physics and chemistry in the Horsehead nebula, a prototypical PDR. We used a model for atomic and
molecular gas in PDRs, the Meudon PDR code, using diffuse ISM-like dust and Horsehead-like dust
to study the influence of nano-grain depletion on the gas physics and chemistry, focusing on the
impact on photoelectric heating and H2 formation and, therefore, on the H2 gas lines. We find that
nano-grain depletion in the Horsehead strongly affects gas heating through the photoelectric
effect and thus the gas temperature and the H2 formation, hence the H -> H2 position. Consequently,
the first four pure rotational lines of H2 (e.g. 0-0 S(0), S(1), S(2), and S(3)) vary by a factor of
2 to 14. The 0-0 S(3) line that is often underestimated in models is underestimated even more when
taking nano-grain depletion into account due to the decrease in gas heating through the photoelectric
effect. This strongly suggests that our understanding of the excitation of H2 and/or of heating
processes in the Horsehead, and more generally in PDRs, is still incomplete. Nano-grain depletion
in the outer part of the Horsehead has a strong influence on several gas tracers that will be prominent
in JWST observations of irradiated clouds. We therefore need to take this depletion into account
in order to improve our understanding of the Horsehead, and more generally PDRs, and to contribute
to the optimal scientific return of the mission.

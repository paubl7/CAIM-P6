Dust is observed in the polar regions of nearby AGN and it is known to contribute substantially to
their mid-IR emission and to the obscuration of their UV to optical emission. We selected a sample
of 1275 BLAGN in the XMM-XXL field, with optical to infrared photometric data. These AGN are seen
along their polar direction and we expect a maximal impact of dust located around the poles when it
is present. We used X-CIGALE, which introduces a dust component to account for obscuration along
the polar directions, modeled as a foreground screen, and an extinction curve that is chosen as it
steepens significantly at short wavelengths or is much grayer. By comparing the results of different
fits, we are able to define subsamples of sources with positive statistical evidence in favor of
or against polar obscuration and described using the gray or steep extinction curve. We find a similar
fraction of sources with positive evidence for and against polar dust. Applying statistical corrections,
we estimate that half of our sample could contain polar dust and among them, 60% exhibit a steep extinction
curve and 40% a flat extinction curve; although these latter percentages are found to depend on the
adopted extinction curves. The obscuration in the V-band is not found to correlate with the X-ray
column density, while A_V/N_H ratios span a large range of values and higher dust temperatures are
found with the flat, rather than with the steep extinction curve. Ignoring this polar dust component
in the fit of the spectral energy distribution of these composite systems leads to an overestimation
of the stellar contribution. A single fit with a polar dust component described with an SMC extinction
curve efficiently overcomes this issue but it fails at identifying all the AGN with polar dust obscuration.

The X-ray telescope eROSITA onboard the newly launched SRG mission serendipitously observed the
galaxy cluster A3408 ($z=0.0420$) during the PV observation of the AGN 1H0707-495. Despite its
brightness and large extent, it has not been observed by any modern X-ray observatory. A neighbouring
cluster in NW direction, A3407 ($z=0.0428$), appears to be close at least in projection ($\sim 1.7$
Mpc). This cluster pair could be in a pre- or post-merger state. We perform a detailed X-ray analysis
of A3408. We construct particle background subtracted and exposure corrected images and surface
brightness profiles in different sectors. The spectral analysis is performed out to $1.4r_{500}$.
Additionally, a temperature map is presented depicting the distribution of the ICM temperature.
Furthermore, we make use of data from the RASS to estimate some bulk properties of A3408 and A3407,
using the growth curve analysis method and scaling relations. The imaging analysis shows a complex
morphology of A3408 with a strong elongation in SE-NW direction. This is quantified by comparing
the surface brightness profiles of the NW, SW, SE and NE directions, where the NW and SE directions
show a significantly higher surface brightness compared to the other directions. We determine
a gas temperature ${\rm k_B}T_{500}=(2.23\pm0.09)$ keV. The T-profile reveals a hot core within
$2'$ of the emission peak, ${\rm k_B}T=3.04^{+0.29}_{-0.25}$ keV. Employing a M-T relation, we
obtain $M_{500}=(9.27\pm0.75)\times 10^{13}M_{\odot}$ iteratively. The $r_{200}$ of A3407
and A3408 are found to overlap in projection which makes ongoing interactions plausible. The 2d
T-map reveals higher temperatures in W than in E direction. A3407 and A3408 are likely in a pre-merger
state, affecting the ICM properties, i.e., increased temperatures in the direction of A3407 indicate
adiabatic compression or shocks due to the interaction.

Luminous Red Novae (LRNe) are astrophysical transients associated with the partial ejection of
a binary system's common envelope (CE) shortly before its merger. Here we present the results of
our photometric and spectroscopic follow-up campaign of AT2018bwo (DLT18x), a LRN discovered
in NGC45, and investigate its progenitor system using binary stellar-evolution models. The transient
reached a peak magnitude of $M_r=-10.97\pm0.11$ and maintained this brightness during its optical
plateau of $t_p = 41\pm5$days. During this phase, it showed a rather stable photospheric temperature
of ~3300K and a luminosity of ~$10^{40}$erg/s. The photosphere of AT2018bwo at early times appeared
larger and cooler than other similar LRNe, likely due to an extended mass-loss episode before the
merger. Towards the end of the plateau, optical spectra showed a reddened continuum with strong
molecular absorption bands. The reprocessed emission by the cooling dust was also detected in the
mid-infrared bands ~1.5 years after the outburst. Archival Spitzer and Hubble Space Telescope
data taken 10-14 years before the transient event suggest a progenitor star with $T_{prog}\sim
6500$K, $R_{prog}\sim 100R_{\odot}$ and $L_{prog}\sim 2\times10^4L_{\odot}$, and an upper
limit for optically thin warm (1000 K) dust mass of $M_d<10^{-6}M_{\odot}$. Using stellar binary-evolution
models, we determined the properties of binary systems consistent with the progenitor parameter
space. For AT2018bwo, we infer a primary mass of 12-16 $M_{\odot}$, which is 9-45% larger than the
~11$M_{\odot}$ obtained using single-star evolution models. The system, consistent with a yellow-supergiant
primary, was likely in a stable mass-transfer regime with -2.4<log ($\dot{M}/M_{\odot}$/yr)<-1.2
a decade before the main instability occurred. During the dynamical merger, the system would have
ejected 0.15-0.5$M_{\odot}$ with a velocity of ~500 km/s.

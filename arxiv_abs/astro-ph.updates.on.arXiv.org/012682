{In order to understand the emergence of the active region, we investigate the emerging process
and magnetic properties of a naked anti-Hale active region during the period between August 24 to
25, 2018.} {Using the data from Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager on board the Soar Dynamic Observatory
and the New Vacuum Solar Telescope, we calculated different evolving parameters (such as pole separation,
tilt angle) and magnetic parameters (such as vertical electric current, force-free parameter,
relative magnetic helicity) during the emergence of the active region. With these calculated parameters
and some reasonable assumptions, we use two different methods to estimate the twist of the active
region.} {The magnetic flux and pole separation continue increasing while the tilt angle exhibits
a decreasing pattern during the emergence of the active region. The increase of the pole separation
is mainly contributed as a result of the enhancement in the longitude direction. A power-law relationship
between pole separation and total flux is found during the emergence of the active region. On the
other hand, it is found that both the positive and negative electric currents increased equivalently
and the average flux-weighted force-free parameter $\tilde \alpha$ remains almost consistently
positive, on the order of $\sim$ 10$^{-8}$ m$^{-1}$. The relative magnetic helicity is mainly contributed
by the shear term, while the relative magnetic helicity injection flux of the shear term changes
its sign at the latter stage of the emergence. The twist number of the whole active region remains
on the order of 10$^{-1}$ turns during the emergence of the active region.} {We find that the magnetic
flux tube with low twist also could emerge into the solar atmosphere.}

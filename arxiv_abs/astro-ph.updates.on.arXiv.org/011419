Gravitational waves (GWs) from strong first-order phase transitions (SFOPTs) in the early Universe
are a prime target for upcoming GW experiments. In this paper, I construct novel peak-integrated
sensitivity curves (PISCs) for these experiments, which faithfully represent their projected
sensitivities to the GW signal from a cosmological SFOPT by explicitly taking into account the expected
shape of the signal. Designed to be a handy tool for phenomenologists and model builders, PISCs allow
for a quick and systematic comparison of theoretical predictions with experimental sensitivities,
as I illustrate by a large range of examples. PISCs also offer several advantages over the conventional
power-law-integrated sensitivity curves (PLISCs); in particular, they directly encode information
on the expected signal-to-noise ratio for the GW signal from a SFOPT. I provide semianalytical fit
functions for the exact numerical PISCs of LISA, DECIGO, and BBO. In an appendix, I moreover present
a detailed review of the strain noise power spectra of a large number of GW experiments. The numerical
results for all PISCs, PLISCs, and strain noise power spectra presented in this paper can be downloaded
from the Zenodo online repository [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3689582]. In a companion
paper [1909.11356], the concept of PISCs is used to perform an in-depth study of the GW signal from
the cosmological phase transition in the real-scalar-singlet extension of the standard model.
The PISCs presented in this paper will need to be updated whenever new theoretical results on the
expected shape of the signal become available. The PISC approach is therefore suited to be used as
a bookkeeping tool to keep track of the theoretical progress in the field.

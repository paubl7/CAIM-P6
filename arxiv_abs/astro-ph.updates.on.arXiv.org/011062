Previous numerical studies have shown that in protostellar outflows, the mass-velocity distribution
$m(v)$ can be well described by a broken power law $\propto v^{- \gamma}$. On the other hand, recent
observations of a sample of outflows show that the CO intensity-velocity distribution, closely
related to $m(v)$, follows an exponential law $\propto \exp(-v/v_0)$. In the present work, we revisit
the physical origin of the mass-velocity relationship $m(v)$ in jet-driven protostellar outflows.
We investigate the respective contributions of the different regions of the outflow, from the swept-up
ambient gas to the jet. We performed 3D numerical simulations of a protostellar jet propagating
into a molecular cloud using the hydrodynamical code Yguazu-a. The code takes into account atomic
and ionic species and was modified to include the H$_2$ gas. We find that by excluding the jet contribution,
$m(v)$ is satisfyingly fitted with a single exponential law, with $v_0$ well in the range of observational
values. The jet contribution results in additional components in the mass-velocity relationship.
This empirical mass-velocity relationship is found to be valid locally in the outflow. The exponent
$v_0$ is almost constant in time and for a given level of mixing between the ambient medium and the
jet material. In general, $v_0$ displays only a weak spatial dependence. A simple modeling of the
L1157 outflow successfully reproduces the various components of the observed CO intensity-velocity
relationship. Our simulations indicate that these components trace the outflow cavity of swept-up
gas and the material entrained along the jet, respectively. The CO intensity-velocity exponential
law is naturally explained by the jet-driven outflow model. The entrained material plays an important
role in shaping the mass-velocity profile.

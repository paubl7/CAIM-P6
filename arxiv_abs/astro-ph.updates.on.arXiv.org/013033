We present redshift space two-point ($\xi$), three-point ($\zeta$) and reduced three-point (Q)
correlation of Ly$\alpha$ absorbers (i.e Voigt profile components having HI column density $N_{HI}>10^{13.5}$cm$^{-2}$)
over three redshift bins spanning $1.7<z<3.5$ using high resolution spectra of 292 quasars. We
detect positive $\xi$ up to 8$h^{-1}$cMpc in all three redshift bins. The strongest detection of
$\zeta$ is seen in $z=1.7-2.3$ redshift bin at $1-2h^{-1}$cMpc with an amplitude of $1.81\pm0.59$
($\sim3.1\sigma$ level). The corresponding Q is found to be $0.68\pm0.23$. The measured $\xi$
and $\zeta$ values show an increasing trend with $N_{HI}$, while Q remains relatively independent
of $N_{HI}$. We find $\xi$ and $\zeta$ to evolve strongly with $z$ over the redshift range studied.
Using hydrodynamical simulations, we find that the $\xi$ and especially $\zeta$ seen in real space
may be strongly amplified by peculiar velocities in redshift space. Simulations also suggest that
while feedback, thermal and pressure smoothing effects affect the clustering of Ly$\alpha$ absorbers
at small scales, i.e $<0.5h^{-1}$cMpc, the HI photo-ionization rates ($\Gamma_{HI}$) strongly
influence the correlation amplitudes at all scales. We find that the strong redshift evolution
shown by $\xi$ and $\zeta$ is primarily sourced by the redshift evolution of the relationship between
$N_{HI}$ and baryon overdensity ($\Delta$). Our simulations that uses available best fitted $\Gamma_{HI}(z)$
measurements produce consistent clustering signals with observations at $z\sim2$ but under-predict
the clustering at higher redshifts. One possible remedy is to have higher values of $\Gamma_{HI}$
at higher redshifts compared to the existing measurements. Alternatively the discrepancy could
be related to non-equilibrium and inhomogeneous conditions prevailing during HeII reionization
not captured by our simulations.

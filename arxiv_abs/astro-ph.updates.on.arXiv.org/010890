We present ~120,000 Spitzer/IRAC candidate young stellar objects (YSOs) based on surveys of the
Galactic midplane between l~255 deg and 110 deg, including the GLIMPSE I, II, and 3D, Vela-Carina,
Cygnus X, and SMOG surveys (613 square degrees), augmented by near-infrared catalogs. We employed
a classification scheme that uses the flexibility of a tailored statistical learning method and
curated YSO datasets to take full advantage of IRAC's spatial resolution and sensitivity in the
mid-infrared ~3-9 micron range. Multi-wavelength color/magnitude distributions provide intuition
about how the classifier separates YSOs from other red IRAC sources and validate that the sample
is consistent with expectations for disk/envelope-bearing pre-main-sequence stars. We also
identify areas of IRAC color space associated with objects with strong silicate absorption or polycyclic
aromatic hydrocarbon emission. Spatial distributions and variability properties help corroborate
the youthful nature of our sample. Most of the candidates are in regions with mid-IR nebulosity,
associated with star-forming clouds, but others appear distributed in the field. Using Gaia DR2
distance estimates, we find groups of YSO candidates associated with the Local Arm, the Sagittarius-Carina
Arm, and the Scutum-Centaurus Arm. Candidate YSOs visible to the Zwicky Transient Facility tend
to exhibit higher variability amplitudes than randomly selected field stars of the same magnitude,
with many high-amplitude variables having light-curve morphologies characteristic of YSOs.
Given that no current or planned instruments will significantly exceed IRAC's spatial resolution
while possessing its wide-area mapping capabilities, Spitzer-based catalogs such as ours will
remain the main resources for mid-infrared YSOs in the Galactic midplane for the near future.

The Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) with the Vera Rubin Observatory will provide strong microlensing
constraints on dark compact objects (DCOs) in our Galaxy. However, most current forecasts limit
their analysis to Primordial Black Holes (PBH) as the primary DCO candidate. Thus, it is unclear
how well LSST microlensing will be able to constrain alternative models of DCOs which may possess
different galactic spatial profile distributions at a subdominant DM fraction. In this work, we
investigate how well LSST microlensing will constrain spherical or disk-like galactic spatial
distributions of DCOs, taking into account the effects of extended observing times, baryonic microlensing
background, and sky distribution of LSST sources. These extensions represent significant improvements
over existing microlensing forecasts for LSST in terms of both accuracy and versatility. We demonstrate
this power by deriving new LSST sensitivity projections for DCOs in spherical and disk-like distributions.
We forecast that LSST will be able to constrain PBHs with one solar mass to have a DM fraction under
$1.6\times10^{-4}$. One-solar-mass objects in a dark disk distribution with the same dimensions
as the Galactic disk will be constrained below $1.4\times10^{-4}$, while those with $m = 10^5 M_{\odot}$
will be constrained to below $9.3\times10^{-6}$. We find that compressed dark disks can be constrained
up to a factor of $\sim10$ better than ones with identical dimensions to the baryonic disk. We also
find that dark disks become less tightly constrained when they are tilted with respect to our own
disk. This forecasting software is a versatile tool, capable of constraining any model of DCOs in
the Milky Way with microlensing, and is made publically available at {https://github.com/HarrisonWinch96/DarkDisk_Microlensing}.

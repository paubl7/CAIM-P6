The redshift ($z$) evolution of the Extragalactic Background Light (EBL) photon density is very
important to understand the history of cosmological structure formation of galaxies and stars
since the epoch of recombination. The EBL photons with the characteristic spectral energy distribution
ranging from ultraviolet/optical to far-infrared provide a major source of opacity of the Universe
to the GeV-TeV $\gamma$-rays travelling over cosmological distances. The effect of the EBL is very
significant through $\gamma \gamma \rightarrow e^- e^+$ absorption process on the propagation
of the $\gamma$-ray photons with energy $E >$ 50 GeV emitted from the sources at $z \sim 1$. This effect
is characterized by the optical depth ($\tau$) which strongly depends on $E$, $z$ and density of
the EBL photons. The proper density of the EBL photons increases with $z$ due to expansion of the Universe
whereas evolution of radiation sources contributing to the EBL leads to a decrease in the density
with increasing $z$. Therefore, the resultant volumetric evolution of the EBL photon density is
approximated by a modified redshift dependence. In this work, we probe evolution of the EBL photon
density predicted by two prominent models using cosmic gamma-ray horizon ($\tau (E,z)=$ 1) determined
by the measurements from the \emph{Fermi}-Large Area Telescope (LAT) observations. The modified
redshift dependence of the EBL photon density is optimized for a given EBL model by estimating the
same gamma-ray horizon as predicted by the \emph{Fermi}-LAT observations. We further compare
the optical depth estimates in the energy range $E =$ 4 GeV-1 TeV and redshift range $z =0.01-1$ from
the \emph{Fermi}-LAT observations with the values derived from the two EBL models to further constrain
the evolution of the EBL photon density in the $z~\sim 1$ Universe.

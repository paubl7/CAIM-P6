In the last decades, several multiwavelength studies have been dedicated to exploring the properties
of the obscuring material in active galactic nuclei (AGN). Various models have been developed to
describe the structure and distribution of this material and constrain its physical and geometrical
parameters through spectral fitting techniques. However, questions, including how the torus
mid-infrared (mid-IR) and X-ray emission are related remain unanswered. In this work, we study
whether the dust continuum at mid-IR and gas reflection at X-rays have the same distribution in a
sample of AGN. We carefully selected a sample of 36 nearby AGN with NuSTAR and Spitzer spectra available
in both archives. We derived the properties of the nuclear dust and gas through a spectral fitting,
using models developed for mid-IR and X-ray wavelengths assuming smooth and clumpy distributions
for this structure. We found that a combination of smooth and clumpy distributions of gas and dust,
respectively, is preferred for ~80% of sources with good spectral fits according to the Akaike criterion.
However, considering extra information about each individual source, such as the absorption variability,
we found that ~50% of our sources are best described by a clumpy distribution of both dust and gas.
The remaining ~50% of our sources can still be explained with a smooth distribution of gas and a clumpy
distribution of dust. The results presented in this paper suggest that the distribution of the gas
and dust in AGN is complex. We find at least six scenarios to explain the observed properties of our
sample. In these scenarios, three gas-dust distribution combinations are possible: clumpy-clumpy,
smooth-smooth, and smooth-clumpy. Most of them are in agreement with the notion that gas could also
be located in the dust-free region, which is consistent with the dust-to-gas ratio found.

HERMES is a scientific mission composed of 3U nano-satellites dedicated to the detection and localization
of high-energy astrophysical transients, with a distributed space architecture to form a constellation
in Earth orbits. The space segment hosts novel miniaturized detectors to probe the X-ray temporal
emission of bright events, such as Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), and the electromagnetic counterparts
of Gravitational Wave Events (GWEs), playing a crucial role in future multi-messenger astrophysics.
During operations, at least three instruments, separated by a minimum distance shall observe a
common area of the sky to perform a triangulation of the observed event. An effective detection by
the nano-satellite payload is achieved by guaranteeing a beneficial orbital and pointing configuration
of the constellation. The design has to cope with the limitations imposed by small space systems,
such as the lack of on-board propulsion and the reduced systems budgets. The paper describes the
methodologies and the proposed strategies to overcome the mission limitations, while achieving
a satisfactory constellation visibility of the sky throughout the mission duration. The mission
design makes use of a high-fidelity orbit propagator, combined with an innovative mission analysis
tool that estimates the scientific performances of the constellation. The influence of the natural
relative motion, which is crucial to achieve an effective constellation configuration without
on-board orbit control, is assessed. The presented methodology can be easily extended to any kind
of distributed scientific space applications, as well as to constellations dedicated to Earth
and planetary observation. In addition, the visibility tool is applicable in the context of the
constellation flight dynamics operations, yielding optimized results and pointing plans based
on actual satellite orbital positions.

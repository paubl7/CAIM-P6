Quasi-Hilda asteroid P/2010 H2 (Vales) underwent a spectacular photometric outburst by 7.5 magnitudes
(factor of 1000) in 2010. Here, we present our optical observations of this event in the four month
period from April 20 to August 10. The outburst, starting UT 2010 April 15.76, released dust particles
of total cross-section 17,600 sq km (albedo 0.1 assumed) and mass 1.2e9 kg, this being about 1e-4
of the mass of the nucleus, taken as a sphere of radius 1.5 km and density 500 kg/m3. While the rising
phase of the outburst was very steep (brightness doubling time of hours), subsequent fading occurred
slowly (fading timescales increasing from weeks to months), as large, low velocity particles drifted
away from the nucleus. A simple model of the fading lightcurve indicates that the ejected particles
occupied a broad range of sizes, from microns to centimeters, and followed a differential power-law
distribution with index 3.6+/-0.1 (similar to that in other comets). The fastest particles had
speeds 210 m/s, indicating gas-drag acceleration of small grains well-coupled to the flow. Low
energy processes known to drive mass loss in active asteroids, including rotational disruption,
thermal and desiccation stress cracking, and electrostatic repulsion, cannot generate the high
particles speeds measured in P/Vales, and are discounted. Impact origin is unlikely given the short
dynamical lifetimes of the quasi-Hildas and the low collision probabilities of these objects.
The specific energy of the ejecta is estimated at 220 J/kg. The outburst follows a series of encounters
with Jupiter in the previous century, consistent with the delayed activation of buried supervolatiles
(and/or the crystallization of sub-surface amorphous ice) by conducted heat following an inward
displacement of the perihelion. A potential origin in the debris cloud produced by avalanche is
also considered.

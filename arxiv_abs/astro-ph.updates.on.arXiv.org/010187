The KBC void is a local underdensity with the observed relative density contrast $\delta \equiv
1 - \rho/\rho_{0} = 0.46 \pm 0.06$ between 40 and 300 Mpc around the Local Group. If mass is conserved
in the Universe, such a void could explain the $5.3\sigma$ Hubble tension. However, the MXXL simulation
shows that the KBC void causes $6.04\sigma$ tension with standard cosmology ($\Lambda$CDM). Combined
with the Hubble tension, $\Lambda$CDM is ruled out at $7.09\sigma$ confidence. Consequently,
the density and velocity distribution on Gpc scales suggest a long-range modification to gravity.
In this context, we consider a cosmological MOND model supplemented with $11 \, \rm{eV}/c^{2}$
sterile neutrinos. We explain why this $\nu$HDM model has a nearly standard expansion history,
primordial abundances of light elements, and cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies.
In MOND, structure growth is self-regulated by external fields from surrounding structures. We
constrain our model parameters with the KBC void density profile, the local Hubble and deceleration
parameters derived jointly from supernovae at redshifts $0.023 - 0.15$, time delays in strong lensing
systems, and the Local Group velocity relative to the CMB. Our best-fitting model simultaneously
explains these observables at the $1.14\%$ confidence level (${2.53 \sigma}$ tension) if the void
is embedded in a time-independent external field of ${0.055 \, a_{_0}}$. Thus, we show for the first
time that the KBC void can naturally resolve the Hubble tension in Milgromian dynamics. Given the
many successful a priori MOND predictions on galaxy scales that are difficult to reconcile with
$\Lambda$CDM, Milgromian dynamics supplemented by $11 \, \rm{eV}/c^{2}$ sterile neutrinos may
provide a more holistic explanation for astronomical observations across all scales.

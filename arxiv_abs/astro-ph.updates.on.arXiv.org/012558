Theoretical studies predict the presence of thermal inversions in the atmosphere of highly irradiated
gas giant planets. Recent observations have identified these inversion layers. However, the role
of different chemical species in their formation remains unclear. We search for the signature of
the thermal inversion agents TiO and Fe in the dayside emission spectrum of the ultra-hot Jupiter
WASP-33b. The spectra were obtained with CARMENES and HARPS-N, covering different wavelength
ranges. Telluric and stellar absorption lines were removed with SYSREM. We cross-correlated the
residual spectra with model spectra to retrieve the signals from the planetary atmosphere. We find
evidence for TiO at a significance of 4.9$\mathrm{\sigma}$ with CARMENES. The strength of the TiO
signal drops close to the secondary eclipse. No TiO signal is found with HARPS-N. An injection-recovery
test suggests that the TiO signal is below the detection level at the wavelengths covered by HARPS-N.
The emission signature of Fe is detected with both instruments at significance levels of 5.7$\mathrm{\sigma}$
and 4.5$\mathrm{\sigma}$, respectively. By combining all observations, we obtain a significance
level of 7.3$\mathrm{\sigma}$ for Fe. We find the TiO signal at $K_\mathrm{p}$ = $248.0_{-2.5}^{+2.0}$
km s$^{-1}$, which is in disagreement with the Fe detection at $K_\mathrm{p}$ = $225.0_{-3.5}^{+4.0}$
km s$^{-1}$. The $K_\mathrm{p}$ value for Fe is in agreement with prior investigations. The model
spectra require different temperature profiles for TiO and Fe to match the observations. We observe
a broader line profile for Fe than for TiO. Our results confirm the existence of a temperature inversion
layer in the planetary atmosphere. The observed $K_\mathrm{p}$ offset and different strengths
of broadening in the line profiles suggest the existence of a TiO-depleted hot spot in the planetary
atmosphere.

We present high resolution millimeter continuum and CO line observations for the circumbinary
disk around V892 Tau to constrain the stellar and disk properties. The total mass of the two near-equal-mass
A stars is estimated to be $6.0\pm0.2\,M_{\odot}$ based on our models of the Keplerian-dominated
gas disk rotation. The detection of strong ionized gas emission associated with the two stars at
8 mm, when combined with previous astrometric measurements in the near-infrared, provides an updated
view of the binary orbit with $a=7.1\pm0.1$ au, $e=0.27\pm0.1$, and $P=7.7\pm0.2$ yr, which is
about half of a previously reported orbital period. The binary orbital plane is proposed to be near
coplanar to the circumbinary disk plane (with a mutual inclination of only $\Delta=8\pm4.2$ deg;
another solution with $\Delta=113$ deg is less likely given the short re-alignment timescale).
An asymmetric dust disk ring peaking at a radius of 0.''2 is detected at 1.3 mm and its fainter counterparts
are also detected at the longer 8 and 9.8 mm. The CO gas disk, though dominated by Keplerian rotation,
presents a mild inner and outer disk misalignment, such that the inner disk to the SW and outer disk
to the NE appear brighter than their counterparts at the opposite disk sides. The radial extension
of the disk, its asymmetric dust ring, and the presence of a disk warp could all be explained by the
interaction between the eccentric binary and the circumbinary disk, which we assume were formed
with non-zero mutual inclination. Some tentatively detected gas spirals in the outer disk are likely
produced by interactions with the low mass tertiary component located 4'' to the northeast. Our
analyses demonstrate the promising usage of V892 Tau as an excellent benchmark system to study the
details of binary--disk interactions.

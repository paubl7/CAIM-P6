X-ray SOI pixel sensors, "XRPIX", are being developed for the next-generation X-ray astronomical
satellite, "FORCE". The XRPIX are fabricated with the SOI technology, which makes it possible to
integrate a high-resistivity Si sensor and a low-resistivity Si CMOS circuit. The CMOS circuit
in each pixel is equipped with a trigger function, allowing us to read out outputs only from the pixels
with X-ray signals at the timing of X-ray detection. This function thus realizes high throughput
and high time resolution, which enables to employ anti-coincidence technique for background rejection.
A new series of XRPIX named XRPIX6E developed with a pinned depleted diode (PDD) structure improves
spectral performance by suppressing the interference between the sensor and circuit layers. When
semiconductor X-ray sensors are used in space, their spectral performance is generally degraded
owing to the radiation damage caused by high-energy protons. Therefore, before using an XRPIX in
space, it is necessary to evaluate the extent of degradation of its spectral performance by radiation
damage. Thus, we performed a proton irradiation experiment for XRPIX6E for the first time at HIMAC
in the NIRS. We irradiated XRPIX6E with high-energy protons with a total dose of up to 40 krad, equivalent
to 400 years of irradiation in orbit. The 40-krad irradiation degraded the energy resolution of
XRPIX6E by 25 $\pm$ 3%, yielding an energy resolution of 260.1 $\pm$ 5.6 eV at the full width half maximum
for 5.9 keV X-rays. However, the value satisfies the requirement for FORCE, 300 eV at 6 keV, even after
the irradiation. It was also found that the PDD XRPIX has enhanced radiation hardness compared to
previous XRPIX devices. In addition, we investigated the degradation of the energy resolution;
it was shown that the degradation would be due to increasing energy-independent components, e.g.,
readout noise.

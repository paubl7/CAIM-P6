Total-power radiometry with individual meter-wave antennas is a potentially effective way to
study the Cosmic Dawn ($z\sim20$) through measurement of sky brightness arising from the $21$~cm
transition of neutral hydrogen, provided this can be disentangled from much stronger Galactic
and extra-galactic foregrounds. In the process, measured spectra of integrated sky brightness
temperature can be used to quantify the foreground emission properties. In this work, we analyze
a subset of data from the Large-aperture Experiment to Detect the Dark Age (LEDA) in the range $50-87$~MHz
and constrain the foreground spectral index $\beta$ in the northern sky visible from mid-latitudes.
We focus on two zenith-directed LEDA radiometers and study how estimates of $\beta$ vary with local
sidereal time (LST). We correct for the effect of gain pattern chromaticity and compare estimated
absolute temperatures with simulations. We develop a reference dataset consisting of 14 days of
optimal condition observations. Using this dataset we estimate, for one radiometer, that $\beta$
varies from $-2.55$ at LST~$<6$~h to a steeper $-2.58$ at LST~$\sim13$~h, consistently with sky
models and previous southern sky measurements. In the LST~$=13-24$~h range, however, we find that
$\beta$ fluctuates between $-2.55$ and $-2.61$ (data scatter $\sim0.01$). We observe a similar
$\beta$ vs. LST trend for the second radiometer, although with slightly smaller $|\beta|$, in the
$-2.46<\beta<-2.43$ range, over $24$~h of LST (data scatter $\sim0.02$). Combining all data gathered
during the extended campaign between mid-2018 to mid-2019, and focusing on the LST~$=9-12.5$~h
range, we infer good instrument stability and find $-2.56<\beta<-2.50$ with $0.09<\Delta\beta<0.12$.

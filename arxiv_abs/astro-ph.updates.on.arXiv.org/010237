Among the most powerful cosmic events, supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be highly
disruptive for life: their radiation can be harmful for biota or induce extinction by removing most
of the protective atmospheric ozone layer on terrestrial planets. Nearby high-energy transient
astrophysical events have been proposed as possible triggers of mass extinctions on Earth. We aim
at assessing the habitability of the Milky Way (MW) along its cosmic history against potentially
disruptive astrophysical transients with the scope of identifying the safest places and epochs
within our Galaxy. We also test the hypothesis that long GRBs had a leading role in the late Ordovician
mass extinction event (~440 Myrs ago). We characterise the habitability of the MW along its cosmic
history as a function of galactocentric distance of terrestrial planets. We estimate the dangerous
effects of transient astrophysical events (long/short GRBs and SNe) with a model which binds their
rate to the specific star formation and metallicity evolution within the Galaxy along its cosmic
history. Our model also accounts for the probability of forming terrestrial planets around FGK
and M stars. Until ~6 billion years ago the outskirts of the Galaxy were the safest places to live,
despite the relatively low density of terrestrial planets. In the last ~4 billion years, regions
between 2 and 8 kpc from the center, featuring a higher density of terrestrial planets, became the
best places for a relatively safer biotic life growth. We confirm the hypothesis that one long GRB
had a leading role in the late Ordovician mass extinction event. In the last 500 Myrs, the safest galactic
region is comprised between 2 and 8 kpc from the center of the MW, whereas the outskirts of the Galaxy
have been sterilized by 2-5 long GRBs.

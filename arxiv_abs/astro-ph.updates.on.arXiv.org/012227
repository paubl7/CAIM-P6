Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are the densest stellar systems in the Universe and are found in the
centres of all types of galaxies. They are thought to form via mergers of star clusters such as ancient
globular clusters (GCs) that spiral to the centre as a result of dynamical friction or through in-situ
star formation directly at the galaxy centre. There is evidence that both paths occur, but the relative
contribution of either channel and their correlation with galaxy properties are not yet constrained
observationally. We aim to derive the dominant NSC formation channel for a sample of 25 nucleated
galaxies, mostly in the Fornax galaxy cluster, with stellar masses between $M_\rm{gal} \sim 10^8$
and $10^{10.5} M_\odot$ and NSC masses between $M_\rm{NSC} \sim 10^5$ and $10^{8.5} M_\odot$.
Using Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) data from the Fornax 3D survey and the ESO archive,
we derive star formation histories, mean ages and metallicities of NSCs, and compare them to the
host galaxies. In many low-mass galaxies, the NSCs are significantly more metal-poor than the hosts
with properties similar to GCs. In contrast, in the massive galaxies, we find diverse star formation
histories and cases of ongoing or recent in-situ star formation. Massive NSCs ($> 10^7 M_\odot$)
occupy a different region in the mass-metallicity diagram than lower mass NSCs and GCs, indicating
a different enrichment history. We find a clear transition of the dominant NSC formation channel
with both galaxy and NSC mass. We hypothesise that while GC-accretion forms the NSCs of the dwarf
galaxies, central star formation is responsible for the efficient mass build up in the most massive
NSCs in our sample. At intermediate masses, both channels can contribute. The transition between
these formation channels seems to occur at galaxy masses $M_\rm{gal} \sim 10^9 M_\odot$ and NSC
masses $M_\rm{NSC} \sim 10^7 M_\odot$.

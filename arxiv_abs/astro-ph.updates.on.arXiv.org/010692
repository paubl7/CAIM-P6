Stellar winds are an integral part of the underlying dynamo, the motor of stellar activity. The wind
controls the star's angular momentum loss, which depends on the magnetic field geometry which varies
significantly in time and latitude. Here we study basic properties of a self-consistent model that
includes simple representations of both the global stellar dynamo in a spherical shell and the exterior
in which the wind accelerates and becomes supersonic. We numerically solve an axisymmetric mean-field
model for the induction, momentum, and continuity equations using an isothermal equation of state.
The model allows for the simultaneous generation of a mean magnetic field and the development of
a Parker wind. The resulting flow is transonic at the critical point, which we arrange to be between
the inner and outer radii of the model. The boundary conditions are assumed to be such that the magnetic
field is antisymmetric about the equator, i.e., dipolar. At the solar rotation rate, the dynamo
is oscillatory and of $\alpha^2$ type. In most of the domain, the magnetic field corresponds to that
of a split monopole. The magnetic energy flux is largest between the stellar surface and the critical
point. The angular momentum flux is highly variable in time and can reach negative values, especially
at midlatitudes. At rapid rotation of up to 50 times the solar value, most of the magnetic field is
lost along the axis within the inner tangential cylinder of the model. The model reveals unexpected
features that are not generally anticipated from models that are designed to reproduce the solar
wind: highly variable angular momentum fluxes even from just an $\alpha^2$ dynamo in the star. A
major caveat of our isothermal models with a magnetic field produced by a dynamo is the difficulty
to reach small enough plasma betas without the dynamo itself becoming unrealistically strong inside
the star.

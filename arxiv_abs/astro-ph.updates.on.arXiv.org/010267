ABRIDGED: Dorado is a nearby, rich and clumpy galaxy group that extends for several degrees in the
Southern Hemisphere. For the first time, we map the Ha distribution as a possible indicator of star
formation (SF) activity of Dorado members a large fraction of which show interaction and merging
signatures. With the 2.5m du Pont and the 1m Swope telescopes we obtained narrow-band, calibrated
images of 14 galaxies, forming the backbone of the group, mapping Ha+[N II] down to few 10$^{-17}$
erg~cm$^{-2}$~s$^{-1}$~arcsec$^{-2}$. We estimated the galaxy star formation rate (SFR) from
the Ha fluxes, corrected for Galaxy foreground extinction and [N II] contamination. Ha+[N II] emission
has been detected in all galaxies. HII regions clearly emerge in late-type galaxies (LTGs) , while
in early-type galaxies (ETGs) the Ha+[N II] emission is dominated by [N II], especially in the central
regions. However, HII complexes are also revealed in four ETGs. Considering the Dorado group as
a whole, we notice that the Ha+[N II] equivalent width, a measure of the specific SF, increases with
the morphological type, from early to late-type members, although it remains lower that what observed
in similar surveys of spiral galaxies. The SFR of the spiral members is in the range of what observed
in similar galaxies surveys James+ (2004), although, in three spirals the SFR is well below the median
for their morphological classes. The SFR of some early-type members tends, at odds, to be higher
than the average derived from Ha+[N II] surveys of this morphological family. We detected in Ha+[N
II] all the ETGs observed and half of them show HII regions. These findings suggest that ETGs in this
group are not dead galaxies: their SF has not shut down yet. Mechanisms such as gas stripping and gas
accretion, through galaxy-galaxy interaction, seem relevant in modifying the SF in this evolutionary
phase of Dorado.

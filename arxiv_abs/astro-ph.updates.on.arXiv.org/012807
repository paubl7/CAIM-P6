We aim to characterize a diverse selection of dense, potentially star-forming cores, clumps, and
clouds within the Milky Way in terms of their dust emission and SF activity. We studied 53 fields that
have been observed in the JCMT SCUBA-2 continuum survey SCOPE and have been mapped with Herschel.
We estimated dust properties by fitting Herschel observations with modified blackbody functions,
studied the relationship between dust temperature and dust opacity spectral index $\beta$, and
estimated column densities. We extracted clumps from the SCUBA-2 850 $\mu$m maps with the FellWalker
algorithm and examined their masses and sizes. Clumps are associated with young stellar objects
found in several catalogs. We estimated the gravitational stability of the clumps with virial analysis.
The clumps are categorized as unbound starless, prestellar, or protostellar. We find 529 dense
clumps, typically with high column densities from (0.3-4.8)$\times 10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, with
a mean of (1.5$\pm$0.04)$\times10^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$, low temperatures ($T\sim $10-20 K), and estimated
submillimeter $\beta$ =1.7$\pm$0.1. We detect a slight increase in opacity spectral index toward
millimeter wavelengths. Masses of the sources range from 0.04 $M_\odot$ to 4259 $M_\odot$. Mass,
linear size, and temperature are correlated with distance. Furthermore, the estimated gravitational
stability is dependent on distance, and more distant clumps appear more virially bound. Finally,
we present a catalog of properties of the clumps.Our sources present a large array of SF regions,
from high-latitude, nearby diffuse clouds to large SF complexes near the Galactic center. Analysis
of these regions will continue with the addition of molecular line data, which will allow us to study
the densest regions of the clumps in more detail.

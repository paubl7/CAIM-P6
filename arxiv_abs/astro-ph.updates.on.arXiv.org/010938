Context. Determining the metallicities and ages of M31 clusters is fundamental to the study of the
formation and evolution of M31 itself. The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic Telescope
(LAMOST) has carried out a systematic spectroscopic campaign of clusters and candidates in M31.
Aims. We constructed a catalogue of 346 M31 clusters observed by LAMOST. By combining the information
of the LAMOST spectra and the multi-band photometry, we developed a new algorithm to estimate the
metallicities and ages of these clusters. Methods. We distinguish young clusters from old using
random forest classifiers based on a empirical training data set selected from the literature.
Ages of young clusters are derived from the spectral energy distribution (SED) fits of their multi-band
photometric measurements. Their metallicities are estimated by fitting their observed spectral
principal components extracted from the LAMOST spectra with those from the young metal-rich single
stellar population (SSP) models. For old clusters, we built non-parameter random forest models
between the spectral principal components and/or multi-band colours and the parameters of the
clusters based on a training data set constructed from the SSP models. The ages and metallicities
of the old clusters are then estimated by fitting their observed spectral principal components
extracted from the LAMOST spectra and multi-band colours from the photometric measurements with
the resultant random forest models. Results. We derived parameters of 53 young and 293 old clusters
in our catalogue. Our resultant parameters are in good agreement with those from the literature.
The ages of about 30 catalogued clusters and metallicities of about 40 sources are derived for the
first time.

We present ultra-deep, matched-resolution Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) observations
at 10 and $3$ GHz in the COSMOS field: the COSMOS-XS survey. The final 10 and $3$ GHz images cover $\sim16\rm{arcmin}^{2}$
and $\sim180\rm{arcmin}^{2}$ and reach median rms values of $0.41\mu\rm{Jy\,beam}^{-1}$ and
$0.53\mu\rm{Jy\,beam}^{-1}$, respectively. Both images have an angular resolution of $\sim
2.0''$. To fully account for the spectral shape and resolution variations across the broad bands,
we image all data with a multi-scale, multi-frequency synthesis algorithm. We present source catalogs
for the 10 and $3$ GHz image with 91 and 1498 sources, respectively, above a peak brightness threshold
of $5\sigma$. We present source counts with completeness corrections included that are computed
via Monte Carlo simulations. Our corrected radio counts at $3$ GHz with direct detections down to
$\sim2.8\mu$Jy are consistent within the uncertainties with other results at 3 and 1.4 GHz, but
extend to fainter flux densities than previous direct detections. The ultra-faint $3$ GHz number
counts are found to exceed the counts predicted by the semi-empirical radio sky simulations developed
in the framework of the SKA Simulated Skies project, consistent with previous P(D) analyses. Our
measured source counts suggest a steeper luminosity function evolution for these faint star-forming
sources. The semi-empirical Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation (T-RECS) predicts
this steeper evolution and is in better agreement with our results. The $10$ GHz radio number counts
also agree with the counts predicted by the T-RECS simulation within the expected variations from
cosmic variance. In summary, the multi-band, matched-resolution COSMOS-XS survey in the well-studied
COSMOS field provides a high-resolution view of the ultra-faint radio sky that can help guide next
generation radio facilities.

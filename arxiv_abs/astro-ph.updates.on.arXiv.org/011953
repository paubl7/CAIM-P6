Super-Earths and sub-Neptunes are commonly thought to have accreted hydrogen/helium envelopes,
consisting of a few to ten percent of their total mass, from the primordial gas disk. Subsequently,
hydrodynamic escape driven by core-powered mass-loss and/or photo-evaporation likely stripped
much of these primordial envelopes from the lower-mass and closer-in planets to form the super-Earth
population. In this work we show that after undergoing core-powered mass-loss, some super-Earths
can retain small residual H/He envelopes. This retention is possible because, for significantly
depleted atmospheres, the density at the radiative-convective boundary drops sufficiently such
that thhe cooling time-scale becomes less than the mass-loss time-scale. The residual envelope
is therefore able to contract, terminating further mass loss. Using analytic calculations and
numerical simulations, we show that the mass of primordial H/He envelope retained as a fraction
of the planet's total mass, $f_{ret}$, increases with increasing planet mass, $M_{c}$, and decreases
with increasing equilibrium temperature, $T_{eq}$, scaling as $f_{ret} \propto M_{c}^{3/2}
T_{eq}^{-1/2} \exp{[M_{c}^{3/4} T_{eq}^{-1}]}$. $f_{ret}$ varies from $< 10^{-8}$ to about
$10^{-3}$ for typical super-Earth parameters. To first order, the exact amount of left-over H/He
depends on the initial envelope mass, the planet mass, its equilibrium temperature, and the envelope's
opacity. These residual hydrogen envelopes reduce the atmosphere's mean molecular weight compared
to a purely secondary atmosphere, a signature observable by current and future facilities. These
remnant atmospheres may, however, in many cases be vulnerable to long-term erosion by photo-evaporation.
Any residual hydrogen envelope likely plays an important role in the long-term physical evolution
of super-Earths, including their geology and geochemistry.

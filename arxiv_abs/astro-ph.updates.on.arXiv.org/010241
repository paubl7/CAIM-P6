The X-ray observations of Mkn 421 show significant spectral curvature that can be reproduced by
a log-parabola function. The spectra can also be fitted by an analytical model considering synchrotron
emission from an electron distribution that is accelerated at a shock front with an energy-dependent
diffusion(EDD model). The spectral fit of NuSTAR and Swift-XRT observations using EDD model during
different flux states reveal the model parameters are strongly correlated. We perform a detailed
investigation of this correlation to decipher the information hidden underneath. The model predicts
the synchrotron peak energy to be correlated with the peak spectral curvature which is consistent
with the case of Mkn 421. Expressing the energy dependence of the diffusion in terms of the magnetohydrodynamic
turbulence energy index, it appears the turbulence shifts from Kolmogorov/Kraichnan type to Bohm
limit during high flux states. Further, the correlation between the best-fit parameters of EDD
model lets us derive an expression for the product of source magnetic field(B) and jet Doppler factor($\delta$)
in terms of synchrotron and Compton peak energies. The synchrotron peak energy is obtained using
the simultaneous Swift-XRT and NuSTAR observations; whereas, the Compton peak energy is estimated
by performing a linear regression analysis of the archival spectral peaks. The deduced $\delta$B
varies over a wide range; however, it satisfies reasonably well with the values estimated solely
from the spectral peak energies independent of the EDD model. This highlights the plausible connection
between the microscopic description of the electron diffusion with the macroscopic quantities
deciding the broadband spectrum of Mkn 421.

The GaLactic and Extragalactic All-sky Murchison Widefield Array (GLEAM) is a radio continuum
survey at 76-227 MHz of the entire southern sky (Declination $<+30\deg$) with an angular resolution
of $\approx 2$ arcmin. In this paper, we combine GLEAM data with optical spectroscopy from the 6dF
Galaxy Survey to construct a sample of 1,590 local (median $z \approx 0.064$) radio sources with
$S_{200\,\mathrm{MHz}} > 55$ mJy across an area of $\approx 16,700~\mathrm{deg}^{2}$. From the
optical spectra, we identify the dominant physical process responsible for the radio emission
from each galaxy: 73 per cent are fuelled by an active galactic nucleus (AGN) and 27 per cent by star
formation. We present the local radio luminosity function for AGN and star-forming galaxies at
200 MHz and characterise the typical radio spectra of these two populations between 76 MHz and $\sim
1$ GHz. For the AGN, the median spectral index between 200 MHz and $\sim 1$ GHz, $\alpha_{\mathrm{high}}$,
is $-0.600 \pm 0.010$ (where $S \propto \nu^{\alpha}$) and the median spectral index within the
GLEAM band, $\alpha_{\mathrm{low}}$, is $-0.704 \pm 0.011$. For the star-forming galaxies, the
median value of $\alpha_{\mathrm{high}}$ is $-0.650 \pm 0.010$ and the median value of $\alpha_{\mathrm{low}}$
is $-0.596 \pm 0.015$. Among the AGN population, flat-spectrum sources are more common at lower
radio luminosity, suggesting the existence of a significant population of weak radio AGN that remain
core-dominated even at low frequencies. However, around 4 per cent of local radio AGN have ultra-steep
radio spectra at low frequencies ($\alpha_{\mathrm{low}} < -1.2$). These ultra-steep-spectrum
sources span a wide range in radio luminosity, and further work is needed to clarify their nature.

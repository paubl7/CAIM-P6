In star-forming galaxies, the far-infrared (FIR) and radio-continuum luminosities obey a tight
empirical relation over a large range of star-formation rates (SFR). To understand the physics,
we examine magneto-hydrodynamic galaxy simulations, which follow the genesis of cosmic ray (CR)
protons at supernovae and their advective and anisotropic diffusive transport. We show that gravitational
collapse of the proto-galaxy drives a small-scale dynamo, which exponentially amplifies weak
seed magnetic fields. After saturation at small scales, they grow in scale to reach equipartition
with thermal and CR energy densities in Milky Way-mass galaxies. In small galaxies, the magnetic
energy saturates at the turbulent energy while it fails to reach equipartition with thermal and
CR energies. We solve for steady-state spectra of CR protons, secondary electrons/positrons from
hadronic CR-proton interactions with the interstellar medium, and primary shock-accelerated
electrons at supernovae. The modeled radio-synchrotron emission is dominated by primary electrons,
irradiates the magnetised disc and bulge of our simulated Milky Way-mass galaxy and weakly traces
bubble-shaped magnetically-loaded outflows. Our star-forming and star-bursting galaxies with
saturated magnetic fields match the global FIR-radio correlation (FRC) across four orders of magnitude.
Its intrinsic scatter arises due to (i) different magnetic saturation levels that result from different
seed magnetic fields, (ii) different radio synchrotron luminosities for different specific SFRs
at fixed SFR and (iii) a varying radio intensity with galactic inclination. In agreement with observations,
several 100-pc-sized regions within star-forming galaxies also obey the FRC, while the centres
of starbursts exceed the FRC by a substantial amount.

Precision calibration of the instruments poses challenges to experiments probing the redshifted
21-cm signal of neutral hydrogen from the Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization (z~30-6). Both
single antenna and interferometers are being used to search for the signal and in both types, systematic
calibration is the leading source of error. Though many aspects of calibration have been studied,
the overlap between the two types of instruments has received less attention. In this paper, we investigate
sky based calibration of total power measurements. Comparing a HERA dish and an EDGES style antenna
we hope to obtain a holistic understanding of the role auto-correlations might play in an interferometer
and what role the sky might play in calibrating a total power instrument. Using simulations we study
various scenarios such as time variable gain, incomplete sky calibration model, and primary beam
model. We find that temporal gain drifts, sky model incompleteness, and beam inaccuracies cause
biases in the receiver gain amplitude and the receiver temperature estimates. In some cases, these
biases mix spectral structure between beam and sky resulting in spectrally variable gain errors.
Applying the calibration method to data from HERA and EDGES we find good agreement with calibration
via the more standard methods and deviations consistent with beam and sky errors similar in scale
to those simulated. While we show that it is possible to partially mitigate biases due to model inaccuracies
by incorporating a time-dependent gain model in calibration, the resulting errors on calibration
products are larger and more correlated. Completely addressing these biases, as in the case of interferometer
sky calibration, will require a more accurate sky model and primary beam models.

We present the first Faraday rotation measure (RM) grid study of an individual low-mass cluster
-- the Fornax cluster -- which is presently undergoing a series of mergers. Exploiting commissioning
data for the POlarisation Sky Survey of the Universe's Magnetism (POSSUM) covering a $\sim34$ square
degree sky area using the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP), we achieve an RM
grid density of $\sim25$ RMs per square degree from a 280 MHz band centred at 887 MHz, which is similar
to expectations for forthcoming GHz-frequency all-sky surveys. We thereby probe the extended
magnetoionic structure of the cluster in unprecedented detail. We find that the scatter in the Faraday
RM of confirmed background sources is increased by $16.8\pm2.4$ rad m$^{-2}$ within 1 degree (360
kpc) projected distance to the cluster centre, which is 2--4 times more extended than the presently-detectable
X-ray-emitting intracluster medium (ICM). The Faraday-active plasma is more massive than the
X-ray-emitting ICM, with an average density that broadly matches expectations for the Warm-Hot
Intergalactic Medium. The morphology of the Faraday depth enhancement exhibits the classic morphology
of an astrophysical bow shock on the southwest side of the main Fornax cluster, and an extended, swept-back
wake on the northeastern side. Our favoured explanation is an ongoing merger between the main cluster
and a sub-cluster to the southwest. The shock's Mach angle and stand-off distance lead to a self-consistent
transonic merger speed with Mach 1.06. The region hosting the Faraday depth enhancement shows a
decrement in both total and polarised intensity. We fail to identify a satisfactory explanation
for this; further observations are warranted. Generally, our study illustrates the scientific
returns that can be expected from all-sky grids of discrete sources generated by forthcoming all-sky
radio surveys.

Aims. Comparing theoretical models with observations allows one to make key step forward towards
an understanding of planetary systems. It however requires a model able to (i) predict all the necessary
observable quantities (not only masses and orbits, but also radii, luminosities, magnitudes,
or evaporation rates) and (ii) address the large range in relevant planetary masses (from Mars mass
to super-Jupiters) and distances (from stellar-grazing to wide orbits). Methods. We have developed
a combined global end-to-end planetary formation and evolution model, the Generation III Bern
model, based on the core accretion paradigm. This model solves as directly as possible the underlying
differential equations for the structure and evolution of the gas disc, the dynamical state of the
planetesimals, the internal structure of the planets yielding their planetesimal and gas accretion
rates, disc-driven orbital migration, and the gravitational interaction of concurrently forming
planets via a full N-body calculation. Importantly, the model also follows the long-term evolution
of the planets on Gigayear timescales after formation including the effects of cooling and contraction,
atmospheric escape, bloating, and stellar tides. Results. To test the model, we compared it with
classical scenarios of Solar System formation. For the terrestrial planets, we find that we obtain
a giant impact phase provided enough embryos (~100) are initially emplaced in the disc. For the giant
planets, we find that Jupiter-mass planets must accrete their core shortly before the dispersal
of the gas disc to prevent strong inward migration that would bring them to the inner edge of the disc.
Conclusions. The model can form planetary systems with a wide range of properties. We find that systems
with only terrestrial planets are often well-ordered while giant-planet bearing systems show
no such similarity.

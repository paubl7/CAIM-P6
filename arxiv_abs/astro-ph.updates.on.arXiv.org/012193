Asteroseismic modelling of the internal structure of main-sequence stars born with a convective
core has so far been based on homogeneous analyses of space photometric Kepler light curves of 4 years
duration, to which most often incomplete inhomogeneously deduced spectroscopic information
was added to break degeneracies. We composed a sample of 111 dwarf gravity-mode pulsators observed
by the Kepler space telescope whose light curves allowed for determination of their near-core rotation
rates. For this sample we assembled HERMES high-resolution optical spectroscopy at the 1.2-m Mercator
telescope. Our spectroscopic information offers additional observational input to also model
the envelope layers of these non-radially pulsating dwarfs. We determined stellar parameters
and surface abundances in a homogeneous way from atmospheric analysis with spectrum normalisation
based on a new machine learning tool. Our results suggest a systematic overestimation of [M/H] in
the literature for the studied F-type dwarfs, presumably due to normalisation limitations caused
by the dense line spectrum of these rotating stars. CNO-surface abundances were found to be uncorrelated
with the rotation properties of the F-type stars. For the B-type stars, we find a hint of deep mixing
from C and O abundance ratios; N abundances have too large uncertainties to reveal a correlation
with the rotation of the stars. Our spectroscopic stellar parameters and abundance determinations
allow for future joint spectroscopic, astrometric (Gaia), and asteroseismic modelling of this
legacy sample of gravity-mode pulsators, with the aim to improve our understanding of transport
processes in the core-hydrogen burning phase of stellar evolution.

Kepler-30 is a unique target to study stellar activity and rotation in a young solar-like star accompanied
by a compact planetary system. We use about 4 years of high-precision photometry collected by the
Kepler mission to investigate the fluctuations caused by photospheric convection, stellar rotation,
and starspot evolution as a function of the timescale. Our main goal is to apply methods for the analysis
of timeseries to find the timescales of the phenomena that affect the light variations. We correlate
those timescales with periodicities in the star as well as in the planetary system. We model the flux
rotational modulation induced by active regions using spot modelling and apply the MFDMA in standard
and multiscale versions for analysing the behaviour of variability and light fluctuations that
can be associated with stellar convection and the evolution of magnetic fields on timescales ranging
from less than 1 day up to about 35 days. The light fluctuations produced by stellar activity can be
described by the multifractal Hurst index that provides a measure of their persistence. The spot
modeling indicates a lower limit to the relative surface differential rotation of $\Delta \Omega/\Omega\sim
0.02\pm 0.01$ and suggests a short-term cyclic variation in the starspot area with a period of $\sim
34$ days, virtually close to the synodic period of 35.2 days of the planet Kepler-30b. By subtracting
the two timeseries of the SAP and PDC Kepler pipelines, we reduce the rotational modulation and find
a 23.1-day period close to the synodic period of Kepler-30c. This period also appears in the multifractal
analysis as a crossover of the fluctuation functions associated with the characteristic evolutionary
timescales of the active regions in Kepler-30 as confirmed by spot modelling. These procedures
and methods may be greatly useful for analysing current TESS and future PLATO data.

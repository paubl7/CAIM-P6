The optical time-domain astronomy has grown rapidly in the past decade but the dynamic infrared
sky is rarely explored. Aiming to construct a sample of mid-infrared outburst in nearby galaxies
(MIRONG), we have conducted a systematical search of low-redshift ($z<0.35$) SDSS spectroscopic
galaxies that have experienced recent MIR flares using their Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE) light curves. A total of 137 galaxies have been selected by requiring a brightening amplitude
of 0.5 magnitude in at least one WISE band with respect to their quiescent phases. Only a small faction
(10.9%) has corresponding optical flares. Except for the four supernova (SNe) in our sample, the
MIR luminosity of remaining sources ($L_{\rm 4.6\mu m}>10^{42}~\rm erg~s^{-1}$) are markedly
brighter than known SNe and their physical locations are very close to the galactic center (median
<0.1"). Only four galaxies are radio-loud indicating that synchrotron radiation from relativistic
jets could contribute MIR variability. We propose that these MIR outburst are dominated by the dust
echoes of transient accretion onto supermassive black holes, such as tidal disruption events (TDEs)
and turn-on (changing-look) AGNs. Moreover, the inferred peak MIR luminosity function is generally
consistent with the X-ray and optical TDEs at high end albeit with large uncertainties. Our results
suggest that a large population of transients have been overlooked by optical surveys, probably
due to dust obscuration or intrinsically optical weakness. Thus, a search in the infrared band is
crucial for us to obtain a panoramic picture of nuclear outburst. The multiwavength follow-up observations
of the MIRONG sample are in progress and will be presented in a series of subsequent papers.

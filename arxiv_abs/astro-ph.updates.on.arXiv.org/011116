The Cassini mission to the Saturn system discovered a plume of ice grains and water vapor erupting
from cracks on the icy surface of the satellite Enceladus. This moon has a global ocean in contact
with a rocky core beneath its icy exterior, making it a promising location to search for evidence
of extraterrestrial life in the solar system. The previous detection of H$_2$ in the plume indicates
that there is free energy available for methanogenesis, the metabolic reaction of H$_2$ with CO$_2$
to form methane and water. Additional metabolic pathways could provide sources of energy in Enceladus'
ocean, but require the use of other oxidants that have not been detected in the plume. Here, we perform
chemical modeling to determine how the production of radiolytic O$_2$ and H$_2$O$_2$, and abiotic
redox chemistry in the ocean and rocky core, contribute to chemical disequilibria that could support
metabolic processes in Enceladus' ocean. We consider three possible cases for ocean redox chemistry:
Case I in which reductants are not present in appreciable amounts and oxidants accumulate over time,
and Cases II and III in which aqueous reductants or seafloor minerals, respectively, convert O$_2$
and H$_2$O$_2$ to SO$_4^{2-}$ and ferric oxyhydroxides. We calculate the upper limits on the concentrations
of oxidants and chemical energy available for metabolic reactions in all three cases, neglecting
additional abiotic reactions. For all three cases, we find that many aerobic and anaerobic metabolic
reactions used by microbes on Earth could meet the minimum free energy threshold required for terrestrial
life to convert ADP to ATP, as well as sustain positive cell density values within the Enceladus seafloor
and/or ocean. These findings indicate that oxidant production and oxidation chemistry could contribute
to supporting possible life and a metabolically diverse microbial community on Enceladus.

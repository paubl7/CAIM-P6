We present the first results of the Galaxy Activity, Torus and Outflows Survey (GATOS), a project
aimed at understanding the properties of the dusty molecular tori and their connection to the host
galaxy in nearby Seyfert galaxies. Our project expands the range of AGN luminosities and Eddington
ratios covered by previous surveys of Seyferts conducted by ALMA and allows us to study the gas feeding
and feedback cycle in a combined sample of 19 Seyferts. We used ALMA to obtain new images of the emission
of molecular gas and dust using the CO(3-2) and HCO+(4-3) lines as well as their underlying continuum
emission at 870 microns with high spatial resolutions (0.1'' ~ 7 - 13 pc) in the CND of 10 nearby (D <
28 Mpc) Seyfert galaxies. Our new ALMA observations detect 870 micron continuum and CO line emission
from spatially resolved disks located around the AGN in all the sources. The bulk of the continuum
flux can be accounted for by thermal emission from dust in the majority of the targets. For most of
the sources the disks show a preponderant orientation perpendicular to the AGN wind axes, as expected
for dusty molecular tori. The median diameters and molecular gas masses of the tori are ~ 42 pc, and
~ 6 x 10**5 Msun, respectively. We find a positive correlation between the line-of-sight gas column
densities responsible for the absorption of X-rays and the molecular gas column densities derived
from CO towards the AGN in our sources. The radial distributions of molecular gas in the CND of our
combined sample show signs of nuclear-scale molecular gas deficits. We also detect molecular outflows
in the sources that show the most extreme nuclear-scale gas deficits in our sample. These observations
find for the first time supporting evidence that the imprint of AGN feedback is more extreme in higher
luminosity and/or higher Eddington ratio Seyfert galaxies.

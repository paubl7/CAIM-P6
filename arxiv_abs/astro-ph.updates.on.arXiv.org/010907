We investigate the star formation histories (SFHs) of massive red spiral galaxies with stellar
mass $M_\ast>10^{10.5}M_\odot$, and make comparisons with blue spirals and red ellipticals of
similar masses. We make use of the integral field spectroscopy from the SDSS-IV/DR15 MaNGA sample,
and estimate spatially resolved SFHs and stellar population properties of each galaxy by applying
a Bayesian spectral fitting code to the MaNGA spectra. We find that massive red spirals are similar
to red ellipticals in both SFHs and present-day stellar populations. Both types of galaxies have
experienced only one major star formation episode at early times, and the result is independent
of the adopted SFH model. On average, more than half of their present-day stellar mass were formed
$>$10 Gyrs ago, and more than 90\% of the mass were formed $>6$ Gyrs ago. The two types of galaxies show
similarly flat profiles in a variety of stellar population parameters: old stellar ages indicated
by $D4000$ (the spectral break at around 4000\AA), high stellar metallicities, large Mgb/Fe ratios
indicative of fast formation, and little stellar dust attenuation. In contrast, the SFHs of blue
spirals cannot be modelled with a single episode of star formation. Although they formed the majority
of stars in their central regions also $>$10 Gyrs ago, both the central and outer disk have been continuously
forming stars over a long timescale. Our results strongly suggest that massive red spirals share
common processes of formation (and possibly quenching) with massive red ellipticals in the sense
that both types were formed at $z>2$ through a fast formation process, and that massive red spirals
are not evolutionary remnants of their blue counterparts. Possible mechanisms for the formation
and quenching of massive red spirals are discussed.

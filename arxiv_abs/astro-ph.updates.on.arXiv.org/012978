Protoplanetary disks drive some of the formation process (e.g., accretion, gas dissipation, formation
of structures, etc.) of stars and planets. Understanding such physical processes is one of the main
astrophysical questions. HD 163296 is an interesting young stellar object for which infrared and
sub-millimeter observations have shown a prominent circumstellar disk with gaps plausibly created
by forming planets. This study aims at characterizing the morphology of the inner disk in HD 163296
with multi-epoch near-infrared interferometric observations performed with GRAVITY at the Very
Large Telescope Interferometer (VLTI). Our goal is to depict the K-band (lambda_0 ~ 2.2 um) structure
of the inner rim with milliarcsecond (sub-au) angular resolution. Our data is complemented with
archival PIONIER (H-band; lambda_0 ~ 1.65 um) data of the source. We performed a Gradient Descent
parametric model fitting to recover the sub-au morphology of our source. Our analysis shows the
existence of an asymmetry in the disk surrounding the central star of HD 163296. We confirm variability
of the disk structure in the inner ~2 mas (0.2 au). While variability of the inner disk structure in
this source has been suggested by previous interferometric studies, this is the first time that
it is confirmed in the H- and K-bands by using a complete analysis of the closure phases and squared
visibilities over several epochs. Because of the separation from the star, position changes, and
persistence of this asymmetric structure on timescales of several years, we argue that it is a dusty
feature (e.g., a vortex or dust clouds), probably, made by a mixing of sillicate and carbon dust and/or
refractory grains, inhomogeneously distributed above the mid-plane of the disk.

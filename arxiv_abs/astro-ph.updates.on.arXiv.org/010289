We have developed an open-source, modular pipeline for the analysis of Spitzer/IRAC channel 1 and
2 time series photometry, incorporating some of the most popular decorrelation methods. We applied
this pipeline to new phase curve observations of ultra-hot Jupiters MASCARA-1b and KELT-16b, and
we have performed the first comprehensive reanalysis of 15 previously published phase curves.
We find that MASCARA-1b and KELT-16b have phase offsets of $1^{+12}_{-11}~^{\circ}$W and $30^{+13}_{-13}~^{\circ}$W,
dayside temperatures of $3017^{+92}_{-90}$ K and $3030^{+150}_{-140}$ K, and nightside temperatures
of $1260^{+400}_{-360}$ K and $1520^{+410}_{-360}$ K, respectively. The Bond albedos of KELT-16b
and MASCARA-1b are poorly constrained but are consistent with zero, and both planets show minimal
recirculation. We confirm a strong correlation between dayside and irradiation temperatures,
a shallow dependency of nightside temperature on irradiation temperature, and a correlation between
Bond albedo and planetary surface gravity. We also find correlations between phase curve amplitude,
orbital period, and phase offset consistent with previous predictions. In addition, while our
different decorrelation models often retrieve similar parameters, significant differences
occasionally arise between our models, as well as between our preferred model and the literature
values. Nevertheless, our preferred models are consistent with published phase offsets to within
$1\pm16$ degrees ($0.6\pm2.5$ sigma), and phase curve amplitudes are on average reproduced to
within $0.02\pm0.19$ ($0.27\pm4.9$ sigma). Finally, we find that BLISS performs best in most cases,
but not all; we therefore recommend future phase curve analyses consider a wide range of detector
models to ensure an optimal fit and to assess the dependence of phase curve parameters on the decorrelation
model used.

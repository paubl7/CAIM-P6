The evolved massive binary star Eta Carinae underwent eruptive mass loss events that formed the
complex bi-polar Homunculus nebula harboring tens of solar masses of unusually nitrogen-rich
gas and dust. Despite expectations for the presence of a significant molecular component to the
gas, detections have been observationally challenged by limited access to the far-infrared and
the intense thermal continuum. A spectral survey of the atomic and rotational molecular transitions
was carried out with the Herschel Space Observatory, revealing a rich spectrum of broad emission
lines originating in the ejecta. Velocity profiles of selected PACS lines correlate well with known
substructures: H I in the central core; NH and weak [C II] within the Homunculus; and [N II] emissions
in fast-moving structures external to the Homunculus. We have identified transitions from [O I],
H I, and 18 separate light C- and O-bearing molecules including CO, CH, CH+, and OH, and a wide set of
N-bearing molecules, NH, NH+, N2H+, NH2, NH3, HCN, HNC, CN, and N2H+. Half of these are new detections
unprecedented for any early-type massive star environment. A very low ratio [12C/13C] LE 4 is estimated
from five molecules and their isotopologues. We demonstrate that non-LTE effects due to the strong
continuum are significant. Abundance patterns are consistent with line formation in regions of
carbon and oxygen depletions with nitrogen enhancements, reflecting an evolved state of the erupting
star with efficient transport of CNO-processed material to the outer layers. The results offer
many opportunities for further observational and theoretical investigations of the molecular
chemistry under extreme physical and chemical conditions around massive stars in their final stages
of evolution.

Context. The nitrogen isotopic ratio is considered an important diagnostic tool of the star formation
process, and $N_2H^+$ is particularly important because it is directly linked to molecular nitrogen
$N_2$. However, theoretical models still lack to provide an exhaustive explanation for the observed
$^{14}N/^{15}N$ values. Aims. Recent theoretical works suggest that the $^{14}N/^{15}N$ behaviour
is dominated by two competing reactions that destroy $ N_2H^+$: dissociative recombination and
reaction with CO. When CO is depleted from the gas phase, if $N_2H^+$ recombination rate is lower
with respect to the $N^{15}NH^+$ one, the rarer isotopologue is destroyed faster. This implies
that the $N_2H^+$ isotopic ratio in protostars should be lower than the one in prestellar cores,
and consistent with the elemental value of ~440. We aim to test this hypothesis, producing the first
sample of $N_2H^+ / N^{15}NH^+$ measurements in low mass protostars. Methods. We observe the $N_2H^+$
and $N^{15}NH^+$ lowest rotational transition towards six young stellar objects in Perseus and
Taurus molecular clouds. We model the spectra with a custom python code using a constant $T_{ex}$
approach to fit the observations. We discuss in appendix the validity of this hypothesis. The derived
column densities are used to compute the nitrogen isotopic ratio. Results. Our analysis yields
an average of $\rm ^{14}N/^{15}N|_{pro} = 420 \pm 15$ in the protostellar sample. This is consistent
with the protosolar value of 440, and significantly lower than the average value previously obtained
in a sample of prestellar objects. Conclusions. Our results are in agreement with the hypothesis
that, when CO is depleted from the gas-phase, dissociative recombinations with free electrons
destroy $N^{15}NH^+$ faster than $N_2H^+$, leading to high isotopic ratios in prestellar cores,
where CO is frozen on dust grains.

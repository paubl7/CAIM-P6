We perform a comprehensive demographic study of the CO extent relative to dust of the disk population
in the Lupus clouds, in order to find indications of dust evolution and possible correlations with
other properties. We increase up to 42 the number of disks of the region with measured CO and dust sizes
($R_{\mathrm{CO}}$, $R_{\mathrm{dust}}$) from observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA). The sizes are obtained from modeling the ${^{12}}$CO $J = 2-1$ line emission and continuum
emission at $\sim 0.89$ mm with an empirical function (Nuker profile or Gaussian function). The
CO emission is more extended than the dust continuum, with a $R_{68\%}^{\mathrm{CO}}$/$R_{68\%}^{\mathrm{dust}}$
median value of 2.5, for the entire population and for a sub-sample with high completeness. 6 disks,
around $15\%$ of the Lupus disk population have a size ratio above 4. Based on thermo-chemical modeling,
this value can only be explained if the disk has undergone grain growth and radial drift. These disks
do not have unusual properties in terms of stellar mass ($M_{\star}$), disk mass ($M_{\mathrm{disk}}$),
CO and dust sizes ($R_{\mathrm{CO}}$, $R_{\mathrm{dust}}$), and mass accretion. We search for
correlations between the size ratio and $M_{\star}$, $M_{\mathrm{disk}}$, $R_{\mathrm{CO}}$
and $R_{\mathrm{dust}}$: only a weak monotonic anti-correlation with the $R_{\mathrm{dust}}$
is found. The lack of strong correlations is remarkable and suggests that the bulk of the population
may be in a similar evolutionary stage, independent of the stellar and disk properties. These results
should be further investigated, since the optical depth difference between CO and dust continuum
may play a role in the inferred size ratios. Lastly, the CO emission for the majority of the disks is
consistent with optically thick emission and an average CO temperature of around 30 K.

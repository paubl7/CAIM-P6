Context: Pollux is considered as an archetype of a giant star hosting a planet. We then discovered
a weak magnetic field at its surface using spectropolarimetry. Aims and Methods: We followed up
our investigations on Pollux first using ESPaDOnS at CFHT and then Narval at TBL to obtain Stokes
I and Stokes V spectra to study their variations for a duration of 4.25 years, that is, for more than
two periods of about 590 d of the RV variations. We used the least-squares deconvolution (LSD) profiles
to measure the longitudinal magnetic field and to perform a Zeeman Doppler imaging (ZDI) investigation.
Results: The longitudinal magnetic field of Pollux is found to vary with a sinusoidal behavior and
a period similar to that of the RV variations. From the ZDI investigation a rotation period of Pollux
is determined to be equal to 660+/-15 days and possibly different than the period of variations of
the RV. As to the magnetic topology, the poloidal component is dominant and almost purely dipolar
with an inclination of 10.5{\deg} of the dipole with respect to the rotation axis. The mean strength
of the surface magnetic field is 0.44 G. Conclusions: As to the origin of the magnetic field of Pollux,
we favor the hypothesis that it is maintained through contemporaneous dynamo action. Pollux appears
as the representative of a class of slowly rotating and weakly magnetic G-K red giants. To explain
the sinusoidal RV variations of Pollux, two scenarios are proposed. If the RV period is different
from the rotation period, the observed periodic RV variations are due to the hosted planet and the
contribution of Pollux magnetic activity is not significantly detected. In the peculiar case in
which the two periods are equal, we cannot discard the possibility that the activity of Pollux could
explain the total RV variations and that the planet hypothesis would appear unnecessary.

Atmospheric compositions offer valuable clues to planetary formation and evolution. Jupiter
has been the most well-studied giant planet in terms of its atmosphere; however, the origin of the
Jovian atmospheric composition remains a puzzle as the abundances of nitrogen and noble gases as
high as those of other elements could only originate from extremely cold environments. We propose
a novel idea for explaining the Jovian atmospheric composition: Dust pileup at the H$_2$O snow line
casts a shadow and cools the Jupiter orbit so that N$_2$ and noble gases can freeze. Planetesimals
or a core formed in the shadowed region can enrich nitrogen and noble gases as much as other elements
through their dissolution in the envelope. We compute the temperature structure of a shadowed protosolar
disk with radiative transfer calculations. Then, we investigate the radial volatile distributions
and predict the atmospheric composition of Jupiter with condensation calculations. We find that
the vicinity of the current Jupiter orbit, approximately $3$--$7~{\rm AU}$, could be as cold as
$30~{\rm K}$ if the small-dust surface density varies by a factor of $\gtrsim30$ across the H$_2$O
snow line. According to previous grain growth simulations, this condition could be achieved by
weak disk turbulence if silicate grains are more fragile than icy grains. The shadow can cause the
condensation of most volatile substances, namely N$_2$ and Ar. We demonstrate that the dissolution
of shadowed solids can explain the elemental abundance patterns of the Jovian atmosphere even if
proto-Jupiter was formed near Jupiter's current orbit. The disk shadow may play a vital role in controlling
atmospheric compositions. The effect of the shadow also impacts the interpretation of upcoming
observations of exoplanetary atmospheres by JWST.

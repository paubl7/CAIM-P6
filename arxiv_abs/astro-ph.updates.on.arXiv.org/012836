Context. Extragalactic Planetary Nebulae (PNe) are useful distance indicators and are often used
to trace the dark-matter content in external galaxies. At the same time, PNe can also be used as probes
of their host galaxy stellar populations and to help understanding the later stages of stellar evolution.
Previous works have indicated that specific number of PNe per stellar luminosity can vary across
different galaxies and as a function of stellar-population properties, for instance increasing
with decreasing stellar metallicity. Aims. In this study we further explore the importance of stellar
metallicity in driving the properties of the PNe population in early-type galaxies, using three
edge-on galaxies in the Fornax cluster offering a clear view into their predominantly metal-rich
and metal-poor regions near the equatorial plane or both below and above it, respectively . Methods.
Using VLT-MUSE integral-field observations and dedicated PNe detection procedures, we construct
the PNe luminosity function and compute the luminosity-specific number of PNe alpha in both in-
and off-plane regions of our edge-on systems. Results. Comparing these alpha values with metallicity
measurements also based on the same MUSE data, we find no evidence for an increase in the specific
abundance of PNe when transitioning between metal-rich and metal-poor regions. Conclusions.
Our analysis highlights the importance of ensuring spatial consistency to avoid misleading results
when investigating the link between PNe and their parent stellar populations and suggest that in
passively-evolving systems variations in the specific number of PNe may pertain to rather extreme
metallicity regimes found either in the innermost or outermost regions of galaxies.

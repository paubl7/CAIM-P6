The success of supernova (SN) cosmology in the determination of the accelerating expansion of the
Universe is based upon the distance standardisation of Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia), which relies
on a single global linear relationship between their brightness and colour, the $\beta$ parameter.
However, there are several pieces of evidence and physical reasons to believe that this relation
may change within different subgroups, or even among individual objects. In this work, by allowing
$\beta$ to vary with different observed properties in the cosmological fits, we coherently bring
together several loose ends of SN science: their distance calibration and the origin of the mass-step,
the presence of multiple intrinsic populations related to environment, and a difference in average
reddening laws for different galaxies. Although the inferred cosmology is always consistent with
previous studies, we find that the SN data favour nonuniversal distributions of $\beta$ when divided
according to SN colour and/or host-galaxy mass. For galaxy mass, we obtain a $\beta$-step relation
in which low $\beta$ values occur in more massive galaxies, a trend that can be explained by differing
dust reddening laws for two types of environments. For colour, we find that bluer/redder SNe Ia are
consistent with a lower/larger $\beta$, which is explained with $\beta$ being a combination of
a low intrinsic colour-luminosity relation dominant in bluer SNe and a higher extrinsic reddening
relation dominant at larger colours. The galaxy mass-step always provides better distance calibration,
regardless of the multiple $\beta$ approaches, and its origin is a difference in intrinsic colour-luminosity
properties of SNe Ia in two types of environments. We also find that blue SNe in low-mass galaxies
are better standard candles than the rest. Our simple methodology can be used in present and future
cosmological analyses.

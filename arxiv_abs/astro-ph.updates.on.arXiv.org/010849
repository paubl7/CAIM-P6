The presence of an invisible substructure has previously been detected in the gravitational lens
galaxy SDSSJ0946+1006 through its perturbation of the lensed images. Using flexible models for
the main halo and the subhalo perturbation to fit the lensed images, we demonstrate that the subhalo
has an extraordinarily high central density and steep density slope. The inferred concentration
for the subhalo is well above the expected scatter in concentrations for $\Lambda$CDM halos of similar
mass. We robustly infer the subhalo's projected mass within 1 kpc to be $\sim 2$-$3.7\times 10^9$M$_\odot$
at $>$95% CL for all our lens models, while the average slope of the subhalo's projected density profile
over the radial range 0.75-1.25 kpc is constrained to be steeper than isothermal ($\gamma_{2D}
\lesssim -1$). By modeling the subhalo light directly, we infer a conservative upper bound on its
luminosity $L_V < 1.2\times 10^8L_\odot$ at 95% CL, which shows that the perturber is dark matter
dominated. To compare to $\Lambda$CDM expectations, we analyze subhalos within analogues of lensing
galaxies in the Illustris TNG100-1 simulation over many lines of sight, and find hundreds of subhalos
that achieve a projected mass within 1 kpc of $\gtrsim 2\times10^9M_\odot$. However, less than
1% of the mock observations yield a log-slope steep enough to be consistent with our lensing models,
and they $all$ have stellar masses in excess of that allowed by observations by about an order of magnitude
or more. We conclude that the presence of such a dark, highly concentrated subhalo is unexpected
in a $\Lambda$CDM universe. Finally, we show that this tension with CDM is not significantly reduced
if the perturber is assumed to be a line-of-sight structure, rather than a subhalo.

Subsequent to the Moon's formation, late accretion to the terrestrial planets strongly modified
the physical and chemical nature of silicate crusts and mantles. This alteration came in the form
of melting through impacts, as well as the belated addition of volatiles and the highly siderophile
elements (HSEs). Current debate centres on whether the lunar HSE record is representative of its
whole late accretion history or alternatively that these were only retained in the mantle and crust
after a particular time, and if so, when. Here we employ improved Monte Carlo impact simulations
of late accretion onto the Moon and Mars and present an updated chronology based on new dynamical
simulations of leftover planetesimals and the E-belt. We take into account the inefficient retention
of colliding material. We compute the crater and basin densities on the Moon and Mars, the largest
objects to strike these planets and the amount of material they accreted. Outputs are used to infer
the mass in leftover planetesimals at a particular time period, which is then compared to the lunar
HSE abundance. From this estimate we calculate a preferred lunar HSE retention age of ca. 4450 Ma
which means that the modelled lunar mantle HSE abundances trace almost all of lunar late accretion.
Based on our results, the surface ages of the lunar highlands are at least 4370 Ma. We find that the
mass of leftover planetesimals with diameters Di<300 km at 4500 Ma that best fits the crater chronology
is approximately 2x10^{-3} Earth mass (ME) while the mass of the E-belt was fixed at 4.5x10^{-4}
ME. We also find that a leftover planetesimal mass in excess of 0.01 ME results in a lunar HSE retention
age younger than major episodes of lunar differentiation and crust formation, which in turn violates
geochemical constraints for the timing and intensity of late accretion to the Earth (Mojzsis et
al., 2019).

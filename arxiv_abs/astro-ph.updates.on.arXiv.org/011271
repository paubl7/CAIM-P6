The anisotropy or triaxiality of massive dark matter haloes largely defines the structure of the
cosmic web, in particular the filaments that join the haloes together. Here we investigate such
oriented correlations in mass-Peak Patch halo catalogues by using the initial strain tensor of
spherical proto-halo regions to orient the haloes. To go beyond the spherically averaged two-point
correlation function of haloes we use oriented stacks to compute oriented two-point correlations:
we explicitly break isotropy by imposing a local frame set by the strain tensor of the reference halo
before stacking neighbouring haloes. Beyond the exclusion zone of the reference halo, clustering
is found to be strongly enhanced along the major direction of the strain tensor as expected. This
anisotropic clustering of haloes along filaments is further quantified by using a spherical harmonics
decomposition. Furthermore, we compute the evolution of cluster-scale halo principal directions
relative to those of their neighbours and show that there are strong correlations extending up to
very large scales. In order to provide calculations more suitable to observational confrontations,
we also utilize 2D projected versions of some equivalent correlation functions. Finally, we show
that the multipole structure of the mass-peak patch halo's anisotropic clustering can be qualitatively
captured in an analytic treatment based on peak theory. Though highly informative, analytic evaluation
involves extensive use of Monte Carlo methods, which is also what the simulated catalogue uses,
taking into account as they do the adaptive nature of the mass-peak patch mass hierarchy and all non-local
complexities associated with the exclusion of smaller haloes overlapping with larger ones: there
is no substitute for the mass-Peak Patch simulation-based determination of oriented and anisotropic
correlations.

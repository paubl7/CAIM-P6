The aim of this work is to determine abundances of neutron-capture elements for thin- and thick-disc
F, G, and K stars in several sky fields near the north ecliptic pole and to compare the results with
the Galactic chemical evolution models, to explore elemental gradients according to stellar ages,
mean galactocentric distances, and maximum heights above the Galactic plane. The observational
data were obtained with the 1.65m telescope at the Moletai Astronomical Observatory and a fibre-fed
high-resolution spectrograph. Elemental abundances were determined using a differential spectrum
synthesis with the MARCS stellar model atmospheres and accounting for the hyperfine-structure
effects. We determined abundances of Sr, Y, Zr, Ba, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, and Eu for 424 thin- and 82 thick-disc
stars. The sample of thick-disc stars shows a clearly visible decrease in [Eu/Mg] with increasing
[Fe/H] compared to the thin-disc stars, bringing more evidence of a different chemical evolution
in these two Galactic components. Abundance correlation with age slopes for the investigated thin-disc
stars are slightly negative for the majority of s-process dominated elements, while r-process
dominated elements have positive correlations. Our sample of thin-disc stars with ages spanning
from 0.1 to 9 Gyrs give the [Y/Mg]=0.022 ($\pm$0.015)-0.027 ($\pm$0.003)*age [Gyr] relation.
For the thick-disc stars, when we also took data from other studies into account, we found that [Y/Mg]
cannot serve as an age indicator. The radial [El/Fe] gradients in the thin disc are negligible for
the s-process dominated elements and become positive for the r-process dominated elements. The
vertical gradients are negative for the light s-process dominated elements and become positive
for the r-process dominated elements. In the thick disc, the radial [El/Fe] slopes are negligible,
and the vertical slopes are predominantly negative.

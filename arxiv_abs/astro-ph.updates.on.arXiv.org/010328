The center of the Milky Way is offering one of the most striking mystery in Astroparticle Physics.
An excess of gamma rays (GCE) has been measured by several groups in the data collected by the Fermi
Large Area Telescope (LAT) towards the Galactic center region. The spectrum and spatial morphology
of the GCE have been claimed by some groups to be compatible with a signal from the Galactic halo of
dark matter (DM). Instead, other analyses have demonstrated that the GCE properties, e.g., its
energy spectrum, highly depend on the choice of the Galactic interstellar emission (IEM) model
source catalogs and analysis techniques. In this paper we investigate the sensitivity of Fermi-LAT
to detect the characteristics of the GCE. In particular we simulate the GCE as given by DM and we verify
that, with a perfect knowledge of the background components, its energy spectrum, position, spatial
morphology and symmetry is properly measured. We also inspect two more realist cases for which there
are imperfections in the IEM model. In the first we have an un-modeled gamma-ray source, constituted
by the low-latitude component of the Fermi bubbles. In the second we simulate the data with one IEM
template and analyze the data with an other. We verify that a mismodeling of the IEM introduces a systematics
of about 10-15% in the GCE energy spectrum between 1-10 GeV and about 5% in the value of the slope for
a NFW DM density profile, which is used to fit the GCE spatial morphology. Finally, we show how the
GCE would be detected in case of alternative processes such as gamma-ray emission from a bulge population
of pulsars or from electrons and positrons or protons injected from the Galactic center. We demonstrate
that for each of these cases there is a distinctive smoking gun signature that would help to identify
the real mechanism behind the origin of the GCE.

Traditionally, 1D models based on scaling laws have been used to parameterized convective heat
transfer rocks in the interior of terrestrial planets like Earth, Mars, Mercury and Venus to tackle
the computational bottleneck of high-fidelity forward runs in 2D or 3D. However, these are limited
in the amount of physics they can model (e.g. depth dependent material properties) and predict only
mean quantities such as the mean mantle temperature. We recently showed that feedforward neural
networks (FNN) trained using a large number of 2D simulations can overcome this limitation and reliably
predict the evolution of entire 1D laterally-averaged temperature profile in time for complex
models [Agarwal et al. 2020]. We now extend that approach to predict the full 2D temperature field,
which contains more information in the form of convection structures such as hot plumes and cold
downwellings. Using a dataset of 10,525 two-dimensional simulations of the thermal evolution
of the mantle of a Mars-like planet, we show that deep learning techniques can produce reliable parameterized
surrogates (i.e. surrogates that predict state variables such as temperature based only on parameters)
of the underlying partial differential equations. We first use convolutional autoencoders to
compress the temperature fields by a factor of 142 and then use FNN and long-short term memory networks
(LSTM) to predict the compressed fields. On average, the FNN predictions are 99.30% and the LSTM
predictions are 99.22% accurate with respect to unseen simulations. Proper orthogonal decomposition
(POD) of the LSTM and FNN predictions shows that despite a lower mean absolute relative accuracy,
LSTMs capture the flow dynamics better than FNNs. When summed, the POD coefficients from FNN predictions
and from LSTM predictions amount to 96.51% and 97.66% relative to the coefficients of the original
simulations, respectively.

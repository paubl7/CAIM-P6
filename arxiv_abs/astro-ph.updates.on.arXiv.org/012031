It has long been suspected that powerful radio sources may lower the efficiency with which stars
form from the molecular gas in their host galaxy, but so far, alternative mechanisms, in particular
related to the stellar mass distribution in the massive bulges of their host galaxies, are not ruled
out. We present new ALMA CO(1-0) interferometry of cold molecular gas in the nearby (z=0.0755),
massive (M_stellar=4x10^11 M_sun), isolated, late-type spiral galaxy 2MASSX J23453269-044925,
which is outstanding for having two pairs of powerful, giant radio jets, and a bright X-ray halo.
The molecular gas is in a massive (M_gas=2x10^10 M_sun), 24 kpc wide, rapidly rotating ring, which
is associated with the inner stellar disk. Broad (FWHM=70-180 km s^-1) lines with complex profiles
associated with the radio source are seen over large regions in the ring, indicating gas velocities
that are high enough to keep the otherwise marginally Toomre-stable gas from fragmenting into gravitationally
bound, star-forming clouds. About 1-2% of the jet kinetic energy are required to power these motions.
Resolved star-formation rate surface densities fall factors 50-75 short of expectations from
the Kennicutt-Schmidt law of star-forming galaxies, and near gas-rich early-type galaxies with
signatures of star formation lowered by jet feedback. We argue that radio AGN feedback is the only
plausible mechanism to explain the low star-formation rates in this galaxy. Previous authors have
already noted that the X-ray halo of J2345-0449 implies a baryon fraction near the cosmic average,
which is very high for a galaxy. We contrast this finding with other, equally massive baryon-rich
spiral galaxies without prominent radio sources. Most of the baryons in these galaxies are in stars,
not in the halos. We also discuss the implications of our results for our general understanding of
AGN feedback in massive galaxies.

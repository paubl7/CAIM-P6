Axion-CMB scenario is an interesting possibility to explain the temperature anisotropy of the
cosmic microwave background (CMB) by primordial fluctuations of the QCD axion \cite{Iso:2020pzv}.
In this scenario, fluctuations of radiations are generated by an energy exchange between axions
and radiations, which results in the correlation between the primordial axion fluctuations and
the CMB anisotropies. Consequently, the cosmological observations stringently constrain a model
of the axion and the early history of the universe. In particular, we need a large energy fraction
$\Omega_A^{}$ of the axion at the QCD phase transition, but it must become tiny at the present universe
to suppress the isocurvature power spectrum. One of natural cosmological scenarios to realize
such a situation is the thermal inflation which can sufficiently dilute the axion abundance. Thermal
inflation occurs in various models. In this paper, we focus on a classically conformal (CC) $B$-$L$
model with a QCD axion. In this model, the early universe undergoes a long supercooling era of the
$B$-$L$ and electroweak symmetries, and thermal inflation naturally occurs. Thus it can be a good
candidate for the axion-CMB scenario. But the axion abundance at the QCD transition is shown to be
insufficient in the original CC $B$-$L$ model. To overcome the situation, we extend the model by
introducing $N$ scalar fields $S$ (either massive or massless) and consider a novel cosmological
history such that the $O(N)$ and the $B$-$L$ sectors evolve almost separately in the early universe.
We find that all the necessary conditions for the axion-CMB scenario can be satisfied in some parameter
regions for massless $S$ fields, typically $N\sim 10^{19}$ and the mass of $B$-$L$ gauge boson around
$5-10$ TeV.

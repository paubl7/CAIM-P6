We study analytic core-envelope models obtained in Negi et al. (1989) under slow rotation. We have
regarded in the present study, the lower bound on the estimate of moment of inertia of the Crab pulsar,
$I_{\rm Crab,45} \geq 2$ (where $I_{45}=I/10^{45}\rm g{cm}^2$) obtained by Gunn and Ostriker
(1969) as a round off value of the recently estimated value of $I_{\rm Crab,45} \geq 1.93$ (Bejger
\& Haensel 2003) for the Crab pulsar. If this value of lower bound is combined with the other observational
constraint obtained for the Crab pulsar (Crawford \& Demiansky 2003), $G_h = I_{\rm core}/I_{\rm
total} \geq 0.7$ ( where $G_h$ is called the glitch healing parameter and represents the fractional
moment of inertia of the core component in the starquake mechanism of glitch generation), the models
yield the mass, $M$, and surface redshift, $z_a$, for the Crab pulsar in the range, $M = 1.79M_\odot
- 1.88M_\odot$; $z_a = 0.374 - 0.393$ ($I_{45} = 2$) for an assigned value of the surface density,
$E_a = 2\times 10^{14}\rm g{cm}^{-3}$ (like, Brecher and Caporaso 1976). This assigned value of
surface density, in fact, is an outcome of the first observational constraint imposed on our models
that further yields the mass $M = 1.96M_\odot $ and surface redshift $z_a=$ 0.414 ($I_{45}= 2$) for
the values of $G_h \approx 0.12$, which actually belongs to the observed `central' weighted mean
value for the Vela pulsar. These values of mass and surface redshift predict the energy of a gravitationally
redshifted electron-positron annihilation line, $E (\rm {MeV}) = 0.511/(1+z_a)$ (Lindblom 1984)
in the range about 0.396 - 401 MeV from the Crab and about 0.389 MeV from the Vela pulsar. The evidence
of a line feature at about 0.40MeV from the Crab pulsar (Leventhal et al. 1977) agrees quite well with
the finding of this study.

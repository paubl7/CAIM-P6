We study the effect of magnetic fields on a simulated galaxy and its surrounding gaseous halo, or
circumgalactic medium (CGM), within cosmological 'zoom-in' simulations of a Milky Way-mass galaxy
as part of the 'Simulating the Universe with Refined Galaxy Environments' (SURGE) project. We use
three different galaxy formation models, each with and without magnetic fields, and include additional
spatial refinement in the CGM to improve its resolution. The central galaxy's star formation rate
and stellar mass are not strongly affected by the presence of magnetic fields, but the galaxy is more
disc-dominated and its central black hole is more massive when $B>0$. The physical properties of
the CGM change significantly. With magnetic fields, the circumgalactic gas flows are slower, the
atomic hydrogen-dominated extended discs around the galaxy are more massive and the densities
in the inner CGM are therefore higher, the temperatures in the outer CGM are higher, and the pressure
in the halo is higher and smoother. The total gas fraction and metal mass fraction in the halo are also
higher when magnetic fields are included, because less gas escapes the halo. Additionally, we find
that the CGM properties depend on azimuthal angle and that magnetic fields reduce the scatter in
radial velocity, whilst enhancing the scatter in metallicity at fixed azimuthal angle. The metals
are thus less well-mixed throughout the halo, resulting in more metal-poor halo gas. These results
together show that magnetic fields in the CGM change the flow of gas in galaxy haloes, making it more
difficult for metal-rich outflows to mix with the metal-poor CGM and to escape the halo, and therefore
should be included in simulations of galaxy formation.

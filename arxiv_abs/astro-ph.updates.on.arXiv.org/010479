Diffuse radio emission has been found in many galaxy clusters, predominantly in massive systems
which are in the state of merging. The radio emission can usually be classified as relic or halo emission,
which are believed to be related to merger shocks or volume-filling turbulence, respectively.
Recent observations have revealed radio bridges for some pairs of very closeby galaxy clusters.
The mechanisms that may allow to explain the high specific density of relativistic electrons, necessary
to explain the radio luminosity of these bridge regions, are poorly explored. We analyse the galaxy
cluster Abell 1430 with LoTSS data in detail and complement it with recent JVLA L-band observations,
XMM-Newton, Chandra, and SDSS data. Moreover, we compare our results to clusters extracted from
the "The Three Hundred Project" cosmological simulation. We find that Abell 1430 consists of two
components, namely A1430-A and A1430-B. We speculate that the two components undergo an off-axis
merger. The more massive component shows diffuse radio emission which can be classified as radio
halo showing a low radio power given the mass of the cluster. Most interestingly, there is extended
diffuse radio emission, dubbed as the `Pillow', which is apparently related to A1430-B and thus
related to low density intracluster or intergalactic medium. To date, a only few examples for emission
originating from such regions are known. These discoveries are crucial to constrain possible acceleration
mechanisms, which may allow to explain the presence of relativistic electrons in these regions.
Our results indicate a spectral index of $\alpha_{144\,\text{MHz}}^{1.5\,\text{GHz}}=-1.4\pm0.5$
for the Pillow. If future observations confirm a slope as flat as the central value of -1.4 or even
flatter, this would pose a severe challenge for the electron acceleration scenarios.

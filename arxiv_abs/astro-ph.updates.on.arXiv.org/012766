We produce the first low to mid frequency radio simulation that incorporates both traditional extragalactic
radio sources as well as synchrotron cosmic web emission. The FIlaments \& GAlactic RadiO (FIGARO)
simulation includes ten unique \SI{4x4}{\degree} fields, incorporating active galactic nucleii
(AGNs), star forming galaxies (SFGs) and synchrotron cosmic web emission out to a redshift of $z
= 0.8$ and over the frequency range 100-1400 MHz. To do this, the simulation brings together a recent
$100^3$ Mpc$^3$ magneto-hydrodynamic simulation (Vazza et al., 2019), calibrated to match observed
radio relic population statistics, alongside updated `T-RECS' code for simulating extragalactic
radio sources (Bonaldi et al., 2019). Uniquely, the AGNs and SFGs are populated and positioned in
accordance with the underlying matter density of the cosmological simulation. In this way, the
simulation provides an accurate understanding of the apparent morphology, angular scales, and
brightness of the cosmic web as well as -- crucially -- the clustering properties of the cosmic web
with respect to the embedded extragalactic radio population. We find that the synchrotron cosmic
web does not closely trace the underlying mass distribution of the cosmic web, but is instead dominated
by shocked shells of emission surrounding dark matter halos and resembles a large, undetected population
of radio relics. We also show that, with accurate kernels, the cosmic web radio emission is clearly
detectable by cross-correlation techniques and this signal is separable from the embedded extragalactic
radio population. We offer the simulation as a public resource towards the development of techniques
for detecting and measuring the synchrotron cosmic web.

Although thousands of galaxy mergers are known, only a handful of sub-kpc scale Super Massive Black
Hole (SMBH) pairs have been confirmed so far, leaving a huge gap between the observed and predicted
numbers of such objects. Here we present a detailed analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey optical
spectrum and of near-infrared diffraction limited imaging of SDSSJ1431+4358. This is a local radio-quiet
type 2 Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) previously selected as double AGN candidate on the basis of
the double-peaked [OIII] emission line. The near-infrared AO-assisted observations were obtained
at the Large Binocular Telescope with the LUCI+FLAO camera. We found that most of the prominent optical
emission lines are characterized by a double-peaked profile, mainly produced by AGN photoionization.
Our spectroscopical analysis disfavors the hypothesis that the double-peaked emission lines
in the source are the signatures of outflow kinematics, leaving open the possibility that we are
detecting either the rotation of a single Narrow Line Region (NLR) or the presence of two SMBHs orbiting
around a common central potential. The latter scenario is further supported by the high-spatial
resolution NIR imaging: after subtracting the dominant contribution of the stellar bulge component
in the host galaxy, we detect two faint nuclear sources at r<0.5 kpc projected separation. Interestingly,
the two sources have a position angle consistent with the one defined by the two regions where the
[OIII] double peaks most likely originate. Beside the discovery of a promising sub-kpc scale dual
AGN, our analysis shows the importance of an appropriate host galaxy subtraction in order to achieve
a reliable estimate of the incidence of dual AGNs at small projected separations.

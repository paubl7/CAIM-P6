Context: WISE J085510.83-071442.5 (W0855) is a unique object: with Teff ca. 250 K, it is the coldest
known brown dwarf (BD), located at only ca.2.2 pc form the Sun. It is extremely faint, which makes
any astronomical observations difficult. However, at least one remotely similar ultra-low-mass
object, the M9 dwarf TVLM 513-46546, has been shown to be a steady radio emitter at frequencies up
to 95 GHz with superimposed active states where strong, pulsed emission is observed. Aims: Our goal
is to determine the millimeter radio properties of W0855 with deep observations around 93 GHz (3.2
mm) in order to investigate whether radio astrometry of this object is feasible and to measure or
set an upper limit on its magnetic field. Methods: We observed W0855 for 94 min at 85.1-100.9 GHz on
24 December 2019 using 44 of the Atacama Large millimeter Array (ALMA) 12 m antennas. We used the standard
ALMA calibration procedure and created the final image for our analysis by accommodating the Quasar
3C 209, the brightest nearby object by far. Furthermore, we created a light curve with a 30 s time resolution
to search for pulsed emission. Results: Our observations achieve a noise RMS of 7.3 {\mu}Jy/beam
for steady emission and of 88 {\mu}Jy for 30 s pulses in the aggregated bandwidth (Stokes I). There
is no evidence for steady or pulsed emission from the object at the time of the observation. We derive
3 {\sigma} upper limits of 21.9 {\mu}Jy on the steady emission and of 264 {\mu}Jy on the pulsed emission
of W0855 between 85 GHz and 101 GHz. Conclusions: Together with the recent non-detection of W0855
at 4-8 GHz, our constraints on the steady and pulsed emission from W0855 confirm that the object is
neither radio-loud nor magnetospherically particularly active.

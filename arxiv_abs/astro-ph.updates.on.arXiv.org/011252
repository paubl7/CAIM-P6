We present VLT-FORS spectropolarimetric observations of the type II supernova (SN) 2012aw taken
at seven epochs during the photospheric phase, from 16 to 120d after explosion. We correct for the
interstellar polarization by postulating that the SN polarization is naught near the rest wavelength
of the strongest lines - this is later confirmed by our modeling. SN2012aw exhibits intrinsic polarization,
with strong variations across lines, and with a magnitude that grows in the 7000A line-free region
from 0.1% at 16d up to 1.2% at 120d. This behavior is qualitatively similar to observations gathered
for other type II SNe. A suitable rotation of Stokes vectors places the bulk of the polarization in
q, suggesting the ejecta of SN2012aw is predominantly axisymmetric. Using an upgraded version
of our 2D polarized radiative transfer code, we model the wavelength- and time-dependent polarization
of SN2012aw. The key observables may be explained by the presence of a confined region of enhanced
56Ni at ~4000km/s, which boosts the electron density in a cone having an opening angle of ~50deg and
an observer's inclination of ~70deg to the axis of symmetry. With this fixed asymmetry in time, the
observed evolution of the SN2012aw polarization arises from the evolution of the ejecta optical
depth, ionization, and the relative importance of multiple versus single scattering. However,
the polarization signatures exhibit numerous degeneracies. Cancellation effects at early times
imply that a low polarization may occur for ejecta with a large asymmetry. An axisymmetric ejecta
with a latitude-dependent explosion energy can also yield similar polarization signatures as
an asymmetric 56Ni distribution. Despite these uncertainties, SN2012aw provides additional
evidence for the generic asymmetry of type II SN ejecta, of which VLT-FORS spectropolarimetric
observations are a decisive and exquisite probe.

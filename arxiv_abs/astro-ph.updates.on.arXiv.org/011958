Models of particle physics that feature phase transitions typically provide predictions for stochastic
gravitational wave signals at future detectors and such predictions are used to delineate portions
of the model parameter space that can be constrained. The question is: how precise are such predictions?
Uncertainties enter in the calculation of the macroscopic thermal parameters and the dynamics
of the phase transition itself. We calculate such uncertainties with increasing levels of sophistication
in treating the phase transition dynamics. Currently, the highest level of diligence corresponds
to careful treatments of the source lifetime; mean bubble separation; going beyond the bag model
approximation in solving the hydrodynamics equations and explicitly calculating the fraction
of energy in the fluid from these equations rather than using a fit; and including fits for the energy
lost to vorticity modes and reheating effects. The lowest level of diligence incorporates none
of these effects. We compute the percolation and nucleation temperatures, the mean bubble separation,
the fluid velocity, and ultimately the gravitational wave spectrum corresponding to the level
of highest diligence for three explicit examples: SMEFT, a dark sector Higgs model, and the real
singlet-extended Standard Model (xSM). In each model, we contrast different levels of diligence
in the calculation and find that the difference in the final predicted signal can be several orders
of magnitude. Our results indicate that calculating the gravitational wave spectrum for particle
physics models and deducing precise constraints on the parameter space of such models continues
to remain very much a work in progress and warrants care.

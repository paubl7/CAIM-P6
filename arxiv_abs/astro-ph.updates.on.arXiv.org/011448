CONTEXT. Gaia EDR3 has produced parallaxes for 1.468x10^9 sources but there are calibration issues
that require corrections to the published values and uncertainties. AIMS. We want to characterize
the behavior of the uncertainties of the Gaia EDR3 parallaxes. We also aim to provide a procedure
for the calculation of distances to stars and stellar clusters. METHODS. We reanalyze some of the
data in the calibration papers for QSO and LMC parallaxes and combine those results with measurements
for six bright GCs. We calculate the angular covariance of EDR3 parallaxes at small separations
based on the LMC results and combine it with the results for larger angles using QSOs to obtain an analytical
formula for the angular covariance over the whole sky. The results for the six GCs are used to validate
the parallax bias correction as a function of magnitude, color, and ecliptic latitude and to determine
the constant used to convert internal uncertainties to external ones. RESULTS. The angular covariance
at zero separation is 106.2 muas^2, yielding a minimum uncertainty for EDR3 parallaxes of 10.3 muas
for individual stars. That value can be only slightly reduced for GCs after considering the behavior
of the angular covariance of the parallaxes for small separations. The Lindegren et al. parallax
bias correction works quite well, except for the brighter magnitudes, suggesting improvements
may be possible there. The value of k is 1.1-1.7 and depends on G. Stars with moderately large values
of RUWE can still provide useful parallaxes albeit with larger values of k. We give accurate and precise
Gaia EDR3 distances to the six GCs and for the specific case of 47 Tuc we are able to beat the angular
covariance limit and derive a high-precision distance of 4.53+-0.06 kpc. Finally, a recipe for
the derivation of distances to stars and stellar clusters using Gaia EDR3 parallaxes is given. [ABRIDGED]

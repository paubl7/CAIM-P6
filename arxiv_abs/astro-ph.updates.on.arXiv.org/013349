In recent years, phosphorus monoxide (PO) -- an important molecule for prebiotic chemistry -- has
been detected in star-forming regions and in the comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. These studies
have revealed that, in the interstellar medium, PO is systematically the most abundant P-bearing
species, with abundances that are $\sim$1-3 times greater than those derived for phosphorus nitride
(PN), the second most abundant P-containing molecule. The reason why PO is more abundant than PN
remains still unclear. Experimental studies with phosphorus in the gas phase are not available,
probably because of the difficulties in dealing with its compounds. Therefore, the reactivity
of atomic phosphorus needs to be investigated using reliable computational tools. To this end,
state-of-the-art quantum-chemical computations have been employed to evaluate accurate reaction
rates and branching ratios for the P + OH $\rightarrow$ PO + H and P + H$_2$O $\rightarrow$ PO + H$_2$
reactions in the framework of a master equation approach based on ab-initio transition state theory.
The hypothesis that OH and H${_2}$O can be potential oxidizing agents of atomic phosphorus is based
on the ubiquitous presence of H${_2}$O in the ISM. Its destruction then produces OH, which is another
very abundant species. While the reaction of atomic phosphorus in its gound state with water is not
a relevant source of PO because of emerged energy barriers, the P + OH reaction represents an important
formation route of PO in the interstellar medium. Our kinetic results show that this reaction follow
an Arrhenius behavior, and thus its rate coefficients alpha=2.28$\times$10$^{-10}$ cm${^3}$
molecule$^{-1}$ s$^{-1}$, beta=0.16 and gamma=0.37 K increase by increasing the temperature.

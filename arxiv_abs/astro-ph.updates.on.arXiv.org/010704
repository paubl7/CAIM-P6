The narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxy Mrk 335 was one of the X-ray brightest AGN, but it has systematically
faded since 2007. Here, we report the discovery with Swift of a sequence of bright and rapid X-ray
flare events that reveal the emergence of Mrk 335 from its ultra-deep multiyear low state. Results
are based on our dedicated multiyear monitoring with Swift. Unlike other bright AGN, the optical-UV
is generally not correlated with the X-rays in Mrk 335 on a timescale of days to months. This fact either
implies the absence of a direct link between the two emission components; or else implies that the
observed X-rays are significantly affected by (dust-free) absorption along our l.o.s. The UV and
optical, however, are closely correlated at the 99.99 percent confidence level. The UV is leading
the optical by delta t = 1.5+/-1.5 d. The Swift X-ray spectrum shows strong deviations from a single
power law in all brightness states of the outbursts, indicating that significant absorption or
reprocessing is taking place. Mrk 335 displays a softer-when-brighter variability pattern at
intermediate X-ray levels, which has been seen in our Swift data since 2007 (based on a total of 590
observations). This pattern breaks down at the highest and lowest count rates. We interpret the
2020 brightening of Mrk 335 as a decrease in column density and covering factor of a partial-covering
absorber along our line of sight in form of a clumpy accretion-disk wind that reveals an increasing
portion of the intrinsic emission of Mrk 335 from the disk and/or corona region, while the optical
emission-line regions receive a less variable spectral energy distribution. This then also explains
why Mrk 335 was never seen to change its optical Seyfert type (not 'changing look') despite its factor
50 X-ray variability with Swift.

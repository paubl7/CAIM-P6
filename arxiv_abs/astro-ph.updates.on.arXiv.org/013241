Spectroscopic observations of the emission lines formed in the solar transition region (TR) commonly
show persistent downflows of the order of 10--15 km/s. The cause of such downflows, however, is still
not fully clear and has remained a matter of debate. We aim to understand the cause of such downflows
by studying the coronal and TR responses to the recently reported chromospheric downflowing rapid
red shifted excursions (RREs), and their impact on heating the solar atmosphere. We have used two
sets of coordinated data from SST, IRIS, and SDO for analyzing the response of the downflowing RREs
in the TR and corona. To provide theoretical support, we use an already existing 2.5D MHD simulation
of spicules performed with the Bifrost code. We find ample occurrences of downflowing RREs and show
several examples of their spatio-temporal evolution, sampling multiple wavelength channels
ranging from the cooler chromospheric to hotter coronal channels. These downflowing features
are thought to be likely associated with the returning components of the previously heated spicular
plasma. Furthermore, the TR Doppler shifts associated with them are close to the average red shifts
observed in this region which further implies that these flows could (partly) be responsible for
the persistent downflows observed in the TR. We also propose two mechanisms (a typical upflow followed
by a downflow and downflows along a loop), from the perspective of numerical simulation, that could
explain the ubiquitous occurrence of such downflows. A detailed comparison between the synthetic
and observed spectral characteristics, reveals a distinctive match, and further suggests an impact
on the heating of the solar atmosphere. We present evidence that suggests that at least some of the
downflowing RREs are the chromospheric counterparts of the TR and lower coronal downflows.

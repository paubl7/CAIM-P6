In the BH-galaxy co-evolution framework, most of the star-formation (SF) and the black hole (BH)
accretion is expected to take place in highly obscured conditions. Thus, obscured AGN are difficult
to identify in optical or X-ray bands, but shine bright in the IR. Moreover, X-ray background (XRB)
synthesis models predict that a large fraction of the yet-unresolved XRB is due to the most obscured
(Compton thick, CT) of these AGN. In this work, we investigate the synergies between putative IR
missions (using SPICA, proposed for ESA/M5 but withdrawn in October 2020, and Origins Space Telescope,
OST, as `templates') and the X-ray mission Athena, which should fly in early 2030s, in detecting
and characterizing AGN, with a particular focus on the most obscured ones. Using an XRB synthesis
model, we estimated the number of AGN and the number of those which will be detected in the X-rays.
For each AGN we associated an optical-to-FIR SED from observed AGN with both X-ray data and SED decomposition,
and used these SEDs to check if the AGN will be detected by SPICA-like or OST at IR wavelengths. We expect
that, with the deepest Athena and SPICA-like (or OST) surveys, we will be able to detect in the IR more
than $90\,\%$ of all the AGN (down to L$_{2-10\text{keV}} \sim 10^{42}\,$erg/s and up to $z \sim
10$) predicted by XRB synthesis modeling, and we will detect at least half of them in the X-rays. Athena
will be extremely powerful in detecting and discerning moderate- and high-luminosity AGN. We find
that the most obscured and elusive CT-AGN will be exquisitely sampled by SPICA-like mission or OST
and that Athena will allow a fine characterization of the most-luminous ones. This will provide
a significant step forward in the process of placing stronger constraints on the yet-unresolved
XRB and investigating the BH accretion rate evolution up to very high redshift ($z \ge 4$).

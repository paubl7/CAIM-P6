Planets form in young circumstellar disks called protoplanetary disks. However, it is still difficult
to catch planet formation in-situ. Nevertheless, from recent ALMA/SPHERE data, encouraging evidence
of the direct and indirect presence of embedded planets has been identified in disks around young
stars: co-moving point sources, gravitational perturbations, rings, cavities, and emission
dips or shadows cast on disks. The interpretation of these observations needs a robust physical
framework to deduce the complex disk geometry. In particular, protoplanetary disk models usually
assume the gas pressure scale-height given by the ratio of the sound speed over the azimuthal velocity
$H/r = c_{s\rm }/v_{\rm k}$. By doing so, \textit{radiative} pressure fields are often ignored,
which could lead to a misinterpretation of the real vertical structure of such disks. We follow the
evolution of a gaseous disk with an embedded Jupiter mass planet through hydrodynamical simulations,
computing the disk scale-height including radiative pressure, which was derived from a generalization
of the stellar atmosphere theory. We focus on the vertical impact of the radiative pressure in the
vicinity of circumplanetary disks, where temperatures can reach $\gtrsim 1000$ K for an accreting
planet, and radiative forces can overcome gravitational forces from the planet. The radiation-pressure
effects create a vertical optically thick column of gas and dust at the proto-planet location, casting
a shadow in scattered light. This mechanism could explain the peculiar illumination patterns observed
in some disks around young stars such as HD 169142 where a moving shadow has been detected, or the extremely
high aspect-ratio $H/r \sim 0.2$ observed in systems like AB Aur and CT Cha.

We present the first southern-hemisphere all-sky imager and radio-transient monitoring system
implemented on two prototype stations of the low-frequency component of the Square Kilometre Array.
Since its deployment the system has been used for real-time monitoring of the recorded commissioning
data. Additionally, a transient searching algorithm has been executed on the resulting all-sky
images. It uses a difference imaging technique, and has enabled identification of a wide variety
of transient classes, ranging from human-made radio-frequency interference to genuine astrophysical
events. Observations at the frequency 159.4 MHz and higher in a single coarse channel (0.926 MHz)
were made with 2s time resolution, and multiple nights were analysed. Despite having modest sensitivity
(~few Jy/beam), using a single coarse channel and 2-s imaging, the system detected bright transients
from PSR B0950+08, proving that it can be used to detect bright transients of an astrophysical origin.
The unusual, extreme activity of the pulsar PSR B0950+08 (up to ~155 Jy/beam) was initially detected
in a "blind" search in the 2020-04-10/11 data and later assigned to this specific pulsar. The limitations
of our data, however, prevent use from making firm conclusions of the effect being due to a combination
of refractive and diffractive scintillation or intrinsic emission mechanisms. The system can
routinely collect data over many days without interruptions; the large amount of recorded data
at 159.4 and 229.7 MHz allowed us to determine a preliminary transient surface density upper limit
of $1.32 \times 10^{-9} \text{deg}^{-2}$ for a timescale and limiting flux density of 2s and 42 Jy,
respectively. We plan to extend the observing bandwidth to tens of MHz and improve time resolution
to tens of milliseconds in order to increase the sensitivity and enable detections of Fast Radio
Bursts below 300 MHz.

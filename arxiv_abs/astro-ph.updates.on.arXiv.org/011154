Gravitational waves are ripples in the space time fabric when high energy events such as black hole
mergers or neutron star collisions take place. The first Gravitational Wave (GW) detection (GW150914)
was made by the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) and Virgo Collaboration
on September 14, 2015. Furthermore, the proof of the existence of GWs had countless implications
from Stellar Evolution to General Relativity. Gravitational waves detection requires multiple
filters and the filtered data has to be studied intensively to come to conclusions on whether the
data is a just a glitch or an actual gravitational wave detection. However, with the use of Deep Learning
the process is simplified heavily, as it reduces the level of filtering greatly, and the output is
more definitive, even though the model produces a probabilistic result. Our technique, Deep Learning,
utilizes a different implementation of a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (CNN).
The model is trained by a composite of real LIGO noise, and injections of GW waveform templates. The
CNN effectively uses classification to differentiate weak GW time series from non-gaussian noise
from glitches in the LIGO data stream. In addition, we are the first study to utilize fine-tuning
as a means to train the model with a second pass of data, while maintaining all the learned features
from the initial training iteration. This enables our model to have a sensitivity (1.00) higher
than all prior studies in this field, when making real-time detections of GWs at an extremely low
SNR (4), while still being less computationally expensive. In part, this sensitivity is also achieved
through the use of deep signal manifolds from both the Hanford and Livingston detectors, which enable
the neural network to be responsive to false positives.

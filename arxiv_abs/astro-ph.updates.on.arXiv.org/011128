We present a deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging study of two dwarf galaxies in the halos of
Local Volume Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) analogs. These dwarfs were discovered as part of our Subaru+Hyper
Suprime-Cam MADCASH survey: MADCASH-1, which is a satellite of NGC 2403 (D~3.2 Mpc), and MADCASH-2,
a previously unknown dwarf galaxy near NGC 4214 (D~3.0 Mpc). Our HST data reach >3.5 mag below the
tip of the red giant branch (TRGB) of each dwarf, allowing us to derive their structural parameters
and assess their stellar populations. We measure TRGB distances ($D=3.41^{+0.24}_{-0.23}$ Mpc
for MADCASH-1, and $D=3.00^{+0.13}_{-0.15}$ Mpc for MADCASH-2), and confirm their associations
with their host galaxies. MADCASH-1 is a predominantly old, metal-poor stellar system (age ~13.5
Gyr, [M/H] ~ -2.0), similar to many Local Group dwarfs. Modelling of MADCASH-2's CMD suggests that
it contains mostly ancient, metal-poor stars (age ~13.5 Gyr, [M/H] ~ -2.0), but that ~10% of its stellar
mass was formed 1.1--1.5 Gyr ago, and ~1% was formed 400--500 Myr ago. Given its recent star formation,
we search MADCASH-2 for neutral hydrogen using the Green Bank Telescope, but find no emission and
estimate an upper limit on the HI mass of $<4.8\times10^4 M_{\odot}$. These are the faintest dwarf
satellites known around host galaxies of LMC mass outside the Local Group ($M_{V,\text{MADCASH-1}}=-7.81\pm0.18$,
$M_{V,\text{MADCASH-2}}=-9.15\pm0.12$), and one of them shows signs of recent environmental
quenching by its host. Once the MADCASH survey for faint dwarf satellites is complete, our census
will enable us to test CDM predictions for hierarchical structure formation, and discover the physical
mechanisms by which low-mass hosts influence the evolution of their satellites.

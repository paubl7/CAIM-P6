We perform a cross validation of the cluster catalog selected by the red-sequence Matched-filter
Probabilistic Percolation algorithm (redMaPPer) in Dark Energy Survey year 1 (DES-Y1) data by
matching it with the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect (SZE) selected cluster catalog from the South Pole
Telescope SPT-SZ survey. Using the mass information from the SZE signal, we calibrate the richness--mass
relation above a measured richness $\hat\lambda>40$ using a Bayesian cluster population model.
We find a mass trend $\lambda\propto M^{B}$ consistent with a linear relation ($B\sim1$), no significant
redshift evolution and an intrinsic scatter in richness of $\sigma_{\lambda} = 0.22\pm0.06$.
By considering two error models, we explore the impact of projection effects on the richness--mass
modelling, confirming that such effects are not detectable at the current level of systematic uncertainties.
At low richness SPT-SZ confirms fewer redMaPPer clusters than expected. We interpret this richness
dependent deficit in confirmed systems as due to the increased presence at low richness of low mass
objects not correctly accounted for by our richness-mass scatter model, which we call contaminants.
At a richness $\hat \lambda=40$, this population makes up $>$12$\%$ (97.5 percentile) of the total
population. Extrapolating this to a measured richness $\hat \lambda=20$ yields $>$22$\%$ (97.5
percentile). With these contamination fractions, the predicted redMaPPer number counts in different
plausible cosmologies are compatible with the measured abundance. The mean mass from stacked weak
lensing (WL) measurements suggests that these low mass contaminants are galaxy groups with masses
$\sim3$-$5\times 10^{13} $ M$_\odot$ which are beyond the sensitivity of current SZE and X-ray
surveys but a natural target for SPT-3G and eROSITA.

With the expectation that projects like LISA and Pulsar Timing Arrays will detect gravitational
waves from supermassive black hole mergers in the near future, it is key that we understand what we
can expect those detections to be, and maximize what we can learn from them. To address this, we study
the mergers of supermassive black holes in the Illustris simulation, looking at both the overall
rate of mergers, and the correlation between merging black holes and the galaxies which host them.
We find that these mergers take place in typical galaxies along the $M_{\rm{BH}}-M_*$ relation,
and that between LISA and PTA detections we can expect to probe the full range of galaxy masses. As
galaxy mergers can trigger increased star formation, we do find that galaxies hosting low-mass
black hole mergers tend to show a slight increase in star formation rates compared to a mass-matched
sample. However, high-mass merger hosts have typical star formation rates, due to a combination
of low gas fractions and powerful AGN feedback. Although minor black hole mergers do not correlate
with disturbed morphologies, major mergers (especially between high-mass black holes) tend to
show morphological evidence of a recent galaxy merger which survives for ~500 Myr. However, this
typical timescale is of the same order of magnitude as the infall/hardening time of the merging black
holes, suggesting that electromagnetic followups to gravitational wave signals may not be able
to observe this correlation. We further find that incorporating a realistic timescale delay for
the black hole mergers could shift the distribution of merger masses toward higher-mass mergers,
decreasing the rate of LISA detections while increasing the rate of PTA detections.

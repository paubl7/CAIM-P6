We investigate the strongly lensed (\mu x10-100) Lyman continuum (LyC) galaxy, dubbed Sunburst,
at z=2.37, taking advantage of a new accurate model of the lens. A characterization of the intrinsic
(delensed) properties of the galaxy yields a size of ~3 sq.kpc, a luminosity Muv=-20.3,and a stellar
mass M~10^9 Msun;16% of the ultraviolet light is located in a 3 Myr old gravitationally-bound young
massive star cluster (YMC) with an effective radius of Re~8 pc and a dynamical mass of ~10^7 Msun (similar
to the stellar mass), from which LyC radiation is detected (\lambda < 912A). The inferred outflowing
gas velocity (>300 km/s) exceeds the escape velocity of the star cluster. The resulting escape fraction
of the ionizing radiation emerging from the Sunburst galaxy is >6-12%, whilst it is >46-93% if inferred
from the YMC. 12 additional likely star clusters with 3<Re<20 pc are identified in the galaxy from
which we derive a cluster formation efficiency \Gamma>~30%, which is consistent with the high \Gamma
derived in local galaxies experiencing extreme gas physical conditions. The presence of the YMC
influences the morphology (nucleation), photometry (photometric jumps) and spectroscopic output
(nebular emission) of the entire galaxy. The de-lensed LyC and UV (1600A) magnitudes of the YMC are
~30.6 and ~26.9, whilst the galaxy has m1600~24.8. A relatively large rest-frame equivalent width
of EWrest(Hb+[OIII]4959-5007)~450A emerges from the galaxy with the YMC contributing to ~30%.
If O-type stars are mainly forged in star clusters, then such engines were the key ionizing agents
during reionization and the increasing occurrence of high EW lines (Hb+[OIII]) observed at z>6.5
might be an indirect signature of a high \Gamma at reionization.Future facilities (like VLT/MAVIS
or ELT), will probe bound clusters on moderately magnified (\mu<5-10) galaxies across cosmic epochs

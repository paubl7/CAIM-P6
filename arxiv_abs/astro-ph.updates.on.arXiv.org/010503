Gravitational wave detections are starting to allow us to probe the physical processes in the evolution
of very massive stars through the imprints they leave on their final remnants. Stellar evolution
theory predicts the existence of a gap in the black hole mass distribution at high mass due to the effects
of pair-instability. Previously, we showed that the location of the gap is robust against model
uncertainties, but it does depend sensitively on the uncertain $^{12}\rm{C}\left(\alpha,\gamma\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$
rate. This rate is of great astrophysical significance and governs the production of oxygen at the
expense of carbon. We use the open source MESA stellar evolution code to evolve massive helium stars
to probe the location of the mass gap. We find that the maximum black hole mass below the gap varies
between $40\rm{M}_\odot$ to $90\rm{M}_\odot$, depending on the strength of the uncertain $^{12}\rm{C}\left(\alpha,\gamma\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$
reaction rate. With the first ten gravitational-wave detections of black holes, we constrain the
astrophysical S-factor for $^{12}\rm{C}\left(\alpha,\gamma\right)^{16}\!\rm{O}$, at $300\rm{keV}$,
to $S_{300}>175\rm{\,keV\, barns}$ at 68% confidence. With $\mathcal{O}(50)$ detected binary
black hole mergers, we expect to constrain the S-factor to within $\pm10$-$30\rm{\,keV\, barns}$.
We also highlight a role for independent constraints from electromagnetic transient surveys.
The unambiguous detection of pulsational pair instability supernovae would imply that $S_{300}>79\rm{\,keV\,
barns}$. Degeneracies with other model uncertainties need to be investigated further, but probing
nuclear stellar astrophysics poses a promising science case for the future gravitational wave
detectors.

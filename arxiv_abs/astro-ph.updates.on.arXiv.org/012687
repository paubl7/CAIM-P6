Aims. We aim to detect molecules in the atmosphere of the young forming companion PDS70 b by searching
for atmospheric absorption features typical of substellar objects. Methods. We obtained medium-resolution
(R$\approx$5075) spectra of the PDS70 planetary system with the SINFONI integral field spectrograph
at the Very Large Telescope. We applied molecular mapping, based on cross-correlation with synthetic
spectra, to identify signatures of molecular species in the atmosphere of the planet. Results.
Although the planet emission is clearly detected when resampling the data to lower resolution,
no molecular species could be identified with the cross-correlation technique. We estimated upper
limits on the abundances of H$_2$O, CO and CH$_4$ ($\log(X_\mathrm{mol}) < -4.0$, $-4.1$ and $-4.9$,
respectively) assuming a clear atmosphere, and we explored the impact of clouds, which increase
the upper limits by a factor up to 0.7 dex. Assuming that the observations directly probe the planet's
atmosphere, we found a lack of molecular species compared to other directly imaged companions or
field objects. Under the assumption that the planet atmosphere presents similar characteristics
to other directly imaged planets, we conclude that a dusty environment surrounds the planet, effectively
obscuring any feature generated in its atmosphere. We quantify the extinction necessary to impede
the detection ($A_V\approx16-17$ mag), pointing to the possibility of higher optical thickness
than previously estimated from other studies. Finally, the non-detection of molecular species
conflicts with atmospheric models previously proposed to describe the forming planet. Conclusions.
To unveil how giant planets form, a comprehensive approach that includes constraints from multiple
techniques needs to be undertaken. Molecular mapping emerges as an alternative to more classical
techniques like SED fitting.

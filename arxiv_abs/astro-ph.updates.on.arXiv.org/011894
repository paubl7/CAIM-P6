We analyze three prototypical black hole (BH) X-ray binaries (XRBs), \4u1630, \gro1655\ and \h1743,
in an effort to systematically understand the intrinsic state transition of the observed accretion-disk
winds between \windon\ and \windoff\ states by utilizing state-of-the-art {\it Chandra}/HETGS
archival data from multi-epoch observations. We apply our magnetically-driven wind models in
the context of magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) calculations to constrain their (1) global density slope
($p$), (2) their density ($n_{17}$) at the foot point of the innermost launching radius and (3) the
abundances of heavier elements ($A_{\rm Fe,S,Si}$). Incorporating the MHD winds into {\tt xstar}
photoionization calculations in a self-consistent manner, we create a library of synthetic absorption
spectra given the observed X-ray continua. Our analysis clearly indicates a characteristic bi-modal
transition of multi-ion X-ray winds; i.e. the wind density gradient is found to steepen (from $p
\sim 1.2-1.4$ to $\sim 1.4-1.5$) while its density normalization declines as the source transitions
from \windon\ to \windoff\ state. The model implies that the ionized wind {\it remains physically
present} even in \windoff\ state, despite its absent appearance in the observed spectra. Super-solar
abundances for heavier elements are also favored. Our global multi-ion wind models, taking into
account soft X-ray ions as well as Fe K absorbers, show that the internal wind condition plays an important
role in wind transitions besides photoionization changes. % Simulated {\it XRISM}/Resolve and
{\it Athena}/X-IFU spectra are presented to demonstrate a high fidelity of the multi-ion wind model
for better understanding of these powerful ionized winds in the coming decades.

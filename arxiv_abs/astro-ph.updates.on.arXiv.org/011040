We combine orbital information from N-body simulations with an analytic model for star formation
quenching and SDSS observations to infer the differential effect of the group/cluster environment
on star formation in satellite galaxies. We also consider a model for gas stripping, using the same
input supplemented with HI fluxes from the ALFALFA survey. The models are motivated by and tested
on the Hydrangea cosmological hydrodynamical simulation suite. We recover the characteristic
times when satellite galaxies are stripped and quenched. Stripping in massive ($M_\mathrm{ vir}\sim
10^{14.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) clusters typically occurs at or just before the first pericentric
passage. Lower mass ($\sim10^{13.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$) groups strip their satellites on a
significantly longer (by $\sim3\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) timescale. Quenching occurs later: Balmer
emission lines typically fade $\sim3.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$ ($5.5\,\mathrm{Gyr}$) after first pericentre
in clusters (groups), followed a few hundred $\mathrm{Myr}$ later by reddenning in $(g-r)$ colour.
These `delay timescales' are remarkably constant across the entire satellite stellar mass range
probed ($\sim10^{9.5}-10^{11}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$), a feature closely tied to our treatment
of `group pre-processing'. The lowest mass groups in our sample ($\sim10^{12.5}\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$)
strip and quench their satellites extremely inefficiently: typical timescales may approach the
age of the Universe. Our measurements are qualitatively consistent with the `delayed-then-rapid'
quenching scenario advocated for by several other studies, but we find significantly longer delay
times. Our combination of a homogeneous analysis and input catalogues yields new insight into the
sequence of events leading to quenching across wide intervals in host and satellite mass.

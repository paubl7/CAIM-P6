For most of their existence stars are fueled by the fusion of hydrogen into helium proceeding via
two theoretically well understood processes, namely the $pp$ chain and the CNO cycle. Neutrinos
emitted along such fusion processes in the solar core are the only direct probe of the deep interior
of the star. A complete spectroscopy of neutrinos from the {\it pp} chain, producing about 99\% of
the solar energy, has already been performed \cite{bib:Nature-2018}. Here, we report the direct
observation, with a high statistical significance, of neutrinos produced in the CNO cycle in the
Sun. This is the first experimental evidence of this process obtained with the unprecedentedly
radio-pure large-volume liquid-scintillator Borexino detector located at the underground Laboratori
Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy. The main difficulty of this experimental effort is to identify
the excess of the few counts per day per 100 tonnes of target due to CNO neutrino interactions above
the backgrounds. A novel method to constrain the rate of \bi contaminating the scintillator relies
on the thermal stabilisation of the detector achieved over the past 5 years. In the CNO cycle, the
hydrogen fusion is catalyzed by the carbon (C) - nitrogen (N) - oxygen (O) and thus its rate, as well
as the flux of emitted CNO neutrinos, directly depends on the abundance of these elements in solar
core. Therefore, this result paves the way to a direct measurement of the solar metallicity by CNO
neutrinos. While this result quantifies the relative contribution of the CNO fusion in the Sun to
be of the order of 1\%, this process is dominant in the energy production of massive stars. The occurrence
of the primary mechanism for the stellar conversion of hydrogen into helium in the Universe has been
proven.

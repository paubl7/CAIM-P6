Astrophysical time series often contain periodic signals. The large and growing volume of time
series data from photometric surveys demands computationally efficient methods for detecting
and characterizing such signals. The most efficient algorithms available for this purpose are
those that exploit the $\mathcal{O}(N\log N)$ scaling of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). However,
these methods are not optimal for non-sinusoidal signal shapes. Template fits (or periodic matched
filters) optimize sensitivity for a priori known signal shapes but at a significant computational
cost. Current implementations of template periodograms scale as $\mathcal{O}(N_f N_{obs})$,
where $N_f$ is the number of trial frequencies and $N_{obs}$ is the number of lightcurve observations,
and due to non-convexity, they do not guarantee the best fit at each trial frequency, which can lead
to spurious results. In this work, we present a non-linear extension of the Lomb-Scargle periodogram
to obtain a template-fitting algorithm that is both accurate (globally optimal solutions are obtained
except in pathological cases) and computationally efficient (scaling as $\mathcal{O}(N_f\log
N_f)$ for a given template). The non-linear optimization of the template fit at each frequency is
recast as a polynomial zero-finding problem, where the coefficients of the polynomial can be computed
efficiently with the non-equispaced fast Fourier transform. We show that our method, which uses
truncated Fourier series to approximate templates, is an order of magnitude faster than existing
algorithms for small problems ($N\lesssim 10$ observations) and 2 orders of magnitude faster for
long base-line time series with $N_{obs} \gtrsim 10^4$ observations. An open-source implementation
of the fast template periodogram is available at https://www.github.com/PrincetonUniversity/FastTemplatePeriodogram.

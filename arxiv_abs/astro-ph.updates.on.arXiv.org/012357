We investigate magnetic activity properties of 21 stars via medium resolution optical spectra
and long-term photometry. Applying synthetic spectrum fitting method, we find that all targets
are cool giant or sub-giant stars possessing overall [M/H] abundances between $0$ and $-0.5$. We
find that six of these targets exhibit only linear trend in mean brightness while eight of them clearly
shows cyclic mean brightness variation. Remaining seven target appear to exhibit cyclic mean brightness
variation but this can not be confirmed due to the long time scales of the predicted cycle compared
to the current time range of the photometric data. We further determine seasonal photometric periods
and compute average photometric period of each target. Analysed sample in this study provides a
quantitative representation of a positive linear correlation between the inverse of the rotation
period and the cycle period normalized to the rotation period, on the log-log scale. We also observe
no correlation between the activity cycle length and the relative surface shear, indicating that
the activity cycle must be driven by a parameter rather than the differential rotation. Our analyses
show that the relative surface shear is positively correlated with the rotation period and there
is a noticeable separation between main sequence stars and our sample. Compared to our sample, the
relative surface shear of a main sequence star is larger for a given rotation period. However, dependence
of the relative surface shear on the rotation period appears stronger for our sample. Analysis of
the current photometric data indicates that the photometric properties of the observed activity
cycles in 8 targets seem dissimilar to the sunspot cycle.

Many galaxy clusters host Mpc scale diffuse radio sources called radio halos. Their origin is connected
to the processes that lead to the formation of clusters themselves. In order to unveil this connection,
statistical studies of radio halos are necessary. We selected a sample of galaxy clusters with M500>6e14Msun
and z=0.08-0.33 from the Planck SZ catalogue. In paper I, we presented the radio and X-ray data analysis
that we carried out on these clusters. Here, we study the radio properties of the sample, in connection
to the mass and dynamical state of clusters. We used the dynamical information derived from the X-ray
data to assess the role of mergers in the origin of radio halos. We studied the distribution of clusters
in the radio power-mass diagram and the role of dynamics on the radio luminosity and emissivity of
radio halos. We measured the occurrence of radio halos as a function of the cluster mass and we compared
it with the expectations of turbulent acceleration models. We found that more than the 90% of radio
halos are in merging clusters and that their radio power correlates with the mass of the host clusters.
The correlation shows a large dispersion. Interestingly, we showed that cluster dynamics contributes
significantly to this dispersion with more disturbed clusters being more radio luminous. Clusters
without radio halos are generally relaxed and the upper limits to their diffuse emission lie below
the correlation. We showed that the radio emissivity of clusters exhibits an apparent bimodality,
with the emissivity of radio halos being at least 5 times larger than the non-emission associated
with more relaxed clusters. We found that the fraction of radio halos drops from ~70% in high mass
clusters to ~35% in the lower mass systems of the sample and we showed that this result is in good agreement
with the expectations from turbulent re-acceleration models.

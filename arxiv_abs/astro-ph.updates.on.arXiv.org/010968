The SEDIGISM (Structure, Excitation and Dynamics of the Inner Galactic Interstellar Medium) survey
used the APEX telescope to map 84 deg^2 of the Galactic plane between l = -60 deg and l = +31 deg in several
molecular transitions, including 13CO(2-1) and C18O(2-1), thus probing the moderately dense
(~10^3 cm^-3) component of the interstellar medium. With an angular resolution of 30'' and a typical
1-sigma sensitivity of 0.8-1.0 K at 0.25 km/s velocity resolution, it gives access to a wide range
of structures, from individual star-forming clumps to giant molecular clouds and complexes. The
coverage includes a good fraction of the first and fourth Galactic quadrants, allowing us to constrain
the large scale distribution of cold molecular gas in the inner Galaxy. In this paper we provide an
updated overview of the full survey and the data reduction procedures used. We also assess the quality
of these data and describe the data products that are being made publicly available as part of this
first data release (DR1). We present integrated maps and position-velocity maps of the molecular
gas and use these to investigate the correlation between the molecular gas and the large scale structural
features of the Milky Way such as the spiral arms, Galactic bar and Galactic centre. We find that approximately
60 per cent of the molecular gas is associated with the spiral arms and these appear as strong intensity
peaks in the derived Galactocentric distribution. We also find strong peaks in intensity at specific
longitudes that correspond to the Galactic centre and well known star forming complexes, revealing
that the 13CO emission is concentrated in a small number of complexes rather than evenly distributed
along spiral arms.

We report on the population of the 47 compact binary mergers detected with a false-alarm rate 1/yr
in the second LIGO--Virgo Gravitational-Wave Transient Catalog, GWTC-2. We observe several characteristics
of the merging binary black hole (BBH) population not discernible until now. First, we find that
the primary mass spectrum contains structure beyond a power-law with a sharp high-mass cut-off;
it is more consistent with a broken power law with a break at $39.7^{+20.3}_{-9.1}\,M_\odot$, or
a power law with a Gaussian feature peaking at $33.1^{+4.0}_{-5.6}\,M_\odot$ (90\% credible interval).
While the primary mass distribution must extend to $\sim65\,M_\odot$ or beyond, only $2.9^{+3.5}_{1.7}\%$
of systems have primary masses greater than $45\,M_\odot$. Second, we find that a fraction of BBH
systems have component spins misaligned with the orbital angular momentum, giving rise to precession
of the orbital plane. Moreover, 12% to 44% of BBH systems have spins tilted by more than $90^\circ$,
giving rise to a negative effective inspiral spin parameter $\chi_\mathrm{eff}$. Under the assumption
that such systems can only be formed by dynamical interactions, we infer that between 25% and 93%
of BBH with non-vanishing $|\chi_\mathrm{eff}| > 0.01$ are dynamically assembled. Third, we estimate
merger rates, finding $\mathcal{R}_\text{BBH} = 23.9^{+14.3}_{8.6}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$
for BBH and $\mathcal{R}_\text{BNS}= 320^{+490}_{-240}$ Gpc$^{-3}$ yr$^{-1}$ for binary neutron
stars. We find that the BBH rate likely increases with redshift ($85\%$ credibility), but not faster
than the star-formation rate ($86\%$ credibility). Additionally, we examine recent exceptional
events in the context of our population models, finding that the asymmetric masses of GW190412 and
the high component masses of GW190521 are consistent with our models, but the low secondary mass
of GW190814 makes it an outlier.

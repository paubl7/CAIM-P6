Since the 1950s, quasi-periodic oscillations have been studied in the terrestrial equatorial
stratosphere. Other planets of the solar system present (or are expected to present) such oscillations,
like the Jupiter Equatorial Oscillation(JEO) and the Saturn Semi-Annual Oscillation (SSAO).
In Jupiter's stratosphere, the equatorial oscillation of its relative temperature structure
about the equator, is characterized by a quasi-period of 4.4 years. The stratospheric wind field
in Jupiter's equatorial zone has never been directly observed. In this paper, we aim at mapping the
absolute wind speeds in Jupiter's equatorial stratosphere to quantify vertical and horizontal
wind and temperature shear. Assuming geostrophic equilibrium, we apply the thermal wind balance
using nearly simultaneous stratospheric temperature measurements between 0.1 and 30 mbar performed
with Gemini/TEXES and direct zonal wind measurements derived at 1 mbar from ALMA observations,
all carried out between March 14th and 22nd, 2017. We are thus able to calculate self-consistently
the zonal wind field in Jupiter's stratosphere where the JEO occurs. We obtain stratospheric map
of the zonal wind speeds as a function of latitude and pressure about Jupiter's equator for the first
time. The winds are vertically layered with successive eastward and westward jets. We find a 200
m/s westward jet at 4 mbar at the equator, with a typical longitudinal variability on the order of
~50 m/s. By extending our wind calculations to the upper troposphere, we find a wind structure qualitatively
close to the wind observed using cloud-tracking techniques. Nearly simultaneous temperature
and wind measurements, both in the stratosphere, are a powerful tool for future investigations
of the JEO (and other planetary equatorial oscillations) and its temporal evolution.

Aims. We aim to perform consistent comparisons between observations and simulations on the mass
dependence of the galaxy major merger fraction at low redshift over an unprecedentedly wide range
of stellar masses (10^9 to 10^12 solar masses). Methods. We first carry out forward modelling of
ideal synthetic images of major mergers and non-mergers selected from the Next Generation Illustris
Simulations (IllustrisTNG) to include major observational effects. We then train deep convolutional
neural networks (CNNs) using realistic mock observations of galaxy samples from the simulations.
Subsequently, we apply the trained CNNs to real the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) images of galaxies
selected from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey. Based on the major merger samples, which
are detected in a consistent manner in the observations and simulations, we determine the dependence
of major merger fraction on stellar mass at z around 0.15 and make comparisons between the two. Results.
The detected major merger fraction in the GAMA/KiDS observations has a fairly mild decreasing trend
with increasing stellar mass over the mass range 10^9 < M_sun < M_star < 10^11.5 M_sun. There is good
agreement in the mass dependence of the major merger fraction in the GAMA/KiDS observations and
the IllustrisTNG simulations over 10^9.5 M_sun < M_star < 10^10.5 M_sun. However, the observations
and the simulations show some differences at M_star > 10^10.5M_sun, possibly due to the supermassive
blackhole feedback in its low-accretion state in the simulations which causes a sharp transition
in the quenched fractions at this mass scale. The discrepancy could also be due to the relatively
small volume of the simulations and/or differences in how stellar masses are measured in simulations
and observations.

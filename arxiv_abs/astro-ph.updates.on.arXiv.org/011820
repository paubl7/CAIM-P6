In Stage-IV imaging surveys, a significant amount of the cosmologically useful information is
due to sources whose images overlap with those of other sources on the sky. The cosmic shear signal
is primarily encoded in the estimated shapes of observed galaxies and thus directly impacted by
overlaps. We introduce a framework based on the Fisher formalism to analyze effects of overlapping
sources (blending) on the estimation of cosmic shear. For the Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of
Space and Time (LSST), we present the expected loss in statistical sensitivity for the ten-year
survey due to blending. We find that for approximately 62% of galaxies that are likely to be detected
in full-depth LSST images, at least 1% of the flux in their pixels is from overlapping sources. We
also find that the statistical correlations between measures of overlapping galaxies and, to a
much lesser extent the higher shot noise level due to their presence, decrease the effective number
density of galaxies, $N_{eff}$, by $\sim$18%. We calculate an upper limit on $N_{eff}$ of 39.4 galaxies
per arcmin$^2$ in $r$ band. We study the impact of varying stellar density on $N_{eff}$ and illustrate
the diminishing returns of extending the survey into lower Galactic latitudes. We extend the Fisher
formalism to predict the increase in pixel-noise bias due to blending for maximum-likelihood (ML)
shape estimators. We find that noise bias is sensitive to the particular shape estimator and measure
of ensemble-average shape that is used, and properties of the galaxy that include redshift-dependent
quantities such as size and luminosity. Based on the magnitude of the estimated biases and these
many dependencies, we conclude that it will not be possible to estimate noise biases of ML shear estimators
using simulations, at the sensitivity required for LSST measurements of cosmic shear.

Uranus provides a unique laboratory to test our understanding of planetary atmospheres under extreme
conditions. Multi-spectral observations from Voyager, ground-based observatories, and space
telescopes have revealed a delicately banded atmosphere punctuated by storms, waves, and dark
vortices, evolving slowly under the seasonal influence of Uranus' extreme axial tilt. Condensables
like methane and hydrogen sulphide play a crucial role in shaping circulation, clouds, and storm
phenomena via latent heat release through condensation, strong equator-to-pole gradients suggestive
of equatorial upwelling and polar subsidence, and through forming stabilising layers that may
decouple different circulation and convective regimes as a function of depth. Weak vertical mixing
and low atmospheric temperatures associated with Uranus' negligible internal heat means that
stratospheric methane photochemistry occurs in a unique high-pressure regime, decoupled from
the influx of external oxygen. The low homopause also allows for the formation of an extensive ionosphere.
Finally, the atmosphere provides a window on the bulk composition of Uranus - the ice-to-rock ratio,
supersolar elemental and isotopic enrichments inferred from remote sensing and future \textit{in
situ} measurements - providing key insights into its formation and subsequent migration. This
review reveals the state of our knowledge of the time-variable circulation, composition, meteorology,
chemistry, and clouds on this enigmatic `Ice Giant,' summarising insights from more than three
decades of observations, and highlighting key questions for the next generation of planetary missions.
As a hydrogen-dominated, intermediate-sized, and chemically-enriched world, Uranus could be
our closest and best example of atmospheric processes on a class of worlds that may dominate the census
of planets beyond our own Solar System.

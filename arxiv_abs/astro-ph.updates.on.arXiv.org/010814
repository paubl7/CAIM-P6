Quenching is a key topic in exploring the formation and evolution of galaxies. In this work, we study
the quenching rate, i.e., the variation in the fraction of quenched galaxies per unit time, of the
Illustris-1 simulation. By building the quenched fraction function $f(m,\rho, t)$ of each snapshot
in the simulation, we derive an accurate form of quenching rate as $\Re_q=df(m,\rho,t)/dt$. According
to the analytic expression of the quenching rate $\Re_q$, we split it into four components: mass
quenching, environmental quenching, intrinsic mass quenching and intrinsic environmental quenching.
The precise value and evolutions can be given via the formula of $\Re_q$. With this method, we analyze
the Illustris-1 simulation. We find that quenched galaxies concentrate around $M_*\simeq10^{11}h^{-1}M_\odot$
and $\delta+1\simeq10^{3.5}$ at earlier times, and that the quenching galaxy population slowly
shifts to lower stellar mass and lower overdensity regions with time. We also find that mass quenching
dominates the quenching process in this simulation, in agreement with some previous analytical
models. Intrinsic quenching is the second most important component. Environmental quenching
is very weak, because it is possible that the pre- or postprocessing of environments disguises environmental
quenching as intrinsic quenching. We find that our method roughly predict the actual quenching
rate. It could well predict the actual amount of galaxies quenched by intrinsic quenching. However,
it overestimates the amount of mass quenching galaxies and underestimates the amount of environmental
quenching. We suggest that the reason is the nonlinearity of the environmental overdensity change
and mass growth of the galaxy.

The underlying distribution of galaxies' dust SEDs (i.e., their spectra re-radiated by dust from
rest-frame $\sim$3$\mu$m-3mm) remains relatively unconstrained due to a dearth of FIR/(sub)mm
data for large samples of galaxies. It has been claimed in the literature that a galaxy's dust temperature
-- observed as the wavelength where the dust SED peaks ($\lambda_{peak}$) -- is traced most closely
by its specific star-formation rate (sSFR) or parameterized 'distance' to the SFR-M$_\star$ relation
(the galaxy 'main sequence'). We present 0.24" resolved 870$\mu$m ALMA dust continuum observations
of seven $z=1.4-4.6$ dusty star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) chosen to have a large range of well-constrained
luminosity-weighted dust temperatures. We also draw on similar resolution dust continuum maps
from a sample of ALESS submillimeter galaxies from Hodge et al. (2016). We constrain the physical
scales over which the dust radiates and compare those measurements to characteristics of the integrated
SED. We confirm significant correlations of $\lambda_{peak}$ with both L$_{IR}$ (or SFR) and $\Sigma_{\rm
IR}$ ($\propto$SFR surface density). We investigate the correlation between $\log_{10}$($\lambda_{peak}$)
and $\log_{10}$($\Sigma_{\rm IR}$) and find the relation to hold as would be expected from the Stefan-Boltzmann
Law, or the effective size of an equivalent blackbody. The correlations of $\lambda_{peak}$ with
sSFR and distance from the SFR-M$_\star$ relation are less significant than those for $\Sigma_{\rm
IR}$ or L$_{IR}$; therefore, we conclude that the more fundamental tracer of galaxies' luminosity-weighted
integrated dust temperatures are indeed their star-formation surface densities in line with local
Universe results, which relate closely to the underlying geometry of dust in the ISM.

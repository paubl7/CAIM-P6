We present the $360^\circ$ catalogue of physical properties of Hi-GAL compact sources, detected
between 70 and 500 $\mu$m. This release not only completes the analogous catalogue previously produced
by the Hi-GAL collaboration for $-71^\circ \lesssim \ell \lesssim 67^\circ$, but also meaningfully
improves it thanks to a new set of heliocentric distances, 120808 in total. About a third of the 150223
entries are located in the newly added portion of the Galactic plane. A first classification based
on detection at 70 $\mu$m as a signature of ongoing star-forming activity distinguishes between
protostellar sources (23~per cent of the total) and starless sources, with the latter further classified
as gravitationally bound (pre-stellar) or unbound. The integral of the spectral energy distribution,
including ancillary photometry from $\lambda=21$ to 1100 $\mu$m, gives the source luminosity
and other bolometric quantities, while a modified black body fitted to data for $\lambda \geq 160\,
\mu$m yields mass and temperature. All tabulated clump properties are then derived using photometry
and heliocentric distance, where possible. Statistics of these quantities are discussed with
respect to both source Galactic location and evolutionary stage. No strong differences in the distributions
of evolutionary indicators are found between the inner and outer Galaxy. However, masses and densities
in the inner Galaxy are on average significantly larger, resulting in a higher number of clumps that
are candidates to host massive star formation. Median behaviour of distance-independent parameters
tracing source evolutionary status is examined as a function of the Galactocentric radius, showing
no clear evidence of correlation with spiral arm positions.

Eccentricity has emerged as a potentially useful tool for helping to identify the origin of black
hole mergers. However, owing to the large number of harmonics required to compute the amplitude
of an eccentric signal, eccentric templates can be computationally very expensive, making statistical
analyses to distinguish distributions from different formation channels very challenging. In
this paper, we outline a method for estimating the signal-to-noise ratio for inspiraling binaries
at lower frequencies such as those proposed for LISA and DECIGO. Our approximation can be useful
more generally for any quasi-periodic sources. We argue that surprisingly, the signal-to-noise
ratio evaluated at or near the peak frequency (of the power) is well approximated by using a constant
noise curve, even if in reality the noise strain has power law dependence. We furthermore improve
this initial estimate over our previous calculation to allow for frequency-dependence in the noise
to expand the range of eccentricity and frequency over which our approximation applies. We show
how to apply this method to get an answer accurate to within a factor of two over almost the entire projected
observable frequency range. We emphasize this method is not a replacement for detailed signal processing.
The utility lies chiefly in identifying theoretically useful discriminators among different
populations and providing fairly accurate estimates for how well they should work. This approximation
can furthermore be useful for narrowing down parameter ranges in a computationally economical
way when events are observed. We furthermore show a distinctive way to identify events with extremely
high eccentricity where the signal is enhanced relative to na\"ive expectations on the high frequency
end.

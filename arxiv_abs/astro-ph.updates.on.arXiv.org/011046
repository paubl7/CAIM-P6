Sirius-like systems are wide binaries composed of a white dwarf (WD) and a companion of a spectral
type earlier than M0. The WD progenitor evolves in isolation, but its wind during the AGB phase pollutes
the companion surface and transfers some angular momentum. Within SHINE survey that uses SPHERE
at the VLT, we acquired images of HD2133, HD114174, and CD-567708 and combined this data with high
resolution spectra of the primaries, TESS, and literature data. We performed accurate abundance
analyses for the MS. We found brighter J and K magnitudes for HD114174B than obtained previously
and extended the photometry down to 0.95 micron. Our new data indicate a higher temperature and then
shorter cooling age (5.57+/-0.02 Gyr) and larger mass (0.75+/-0.03 Mo) for this WD than previously
assumed. This solved the discrepancy previously found with the age of the MS star. The two other WDs
are less massive, indicating progenitors of ~1.3 Mo and 1.5-1.8 Mo for HD2133B and CD-56 7708B, respectively.
We were able to derive constraints on the orbit for HD114174 and CD-56 7708. The composition of the
MS stars agrees fairly well with expectations from pollution by the AGB progenitors of the WDs: HD2133A
has a small enrichment of n-capture elements, which is as expected for pollution by an AGB star with
a mass <1.5 Mo; CD-56 7708A is a previously unrecognized mild Ba-star, which is expected due to pollution
by an AGB star with a mass in the range of 1.5-3.0 Mo; and HD114174 has a very moderate excess of n-capture
elements, which is in agreement with the expectation for a massive AGB star to have a mass >3.0 Mo.
On the other hand, none of these stars show the excesses of C that are expected to go along with those
of n-capture elements. This might be related to the fact that these stars are at the edges of the mass
range where we expect nucleosynthesis related to thermal pulses.

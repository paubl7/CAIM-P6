Globular clusters (GCs) in the Milky Way (MW) bulge are very difficult to study because: i) they suffer
from the severe crowding and galactic extinction; which are characteristic of these inner Galactic
regions ii) they are more prone to be affected by dynamical processes. Therefore, they are relatively
faint and difficult to map. However, deep near-infrared photometry like that provided by the VISTA
Variables in the Via L\'actea Extended Survey (VVVX) is allowing us to map GCs in this crucial yet
relatively uncharted region. Our results confirm with high confidence that both FSR 19 and FSR 25
are genuine MW bulge GCs. Each of the performed tests and resulting parameters provides clear evidence
for the GC nature of these targets. We derive distances of 7.2$\pm$0.7 kpc and D=7.0$\pm$0.6 (corresponding
to distance moduli of 14.29$\pm$0.08 and 14.23$\pm$0.07) for FSR 19 and FSR 25, respectively. Their
ages and metallicities are 11 Gyr and [Fe/H]= -0.5 dex for both clusters, which were determined from
Dartmouth and PARSEC isochrone fitting. The integrated luminosities are M$_{Ks}$(FSR 19) = -7.72
mag and M$_{Ks}$(FSR 25) = -7.31 mag which places them in the faint tail of the GC Luminosity Function.
By adopting a King profile for their number distribution, we determine their core and tidal radii
($r_c$, $r_t$). For FSR 19, r$_{c}$= 2.76$\pm$0.36 pc and r$_{t}$=5.31$\pm$0.49 pc, while FSR
25 appears more extended with r$_{c}$= 1.92$\pm$0.59 pc and r$_{t}$=6.85$\pm$1.78 pc. Finally
their mean GC PMs (from Gaia EDR3) are $\mu_{\alpha^\ast}$= -2.50 $\pm$0.76 mas $yr^{-1}$, $\mu_{\delta}$=
-5.02 $\pm$0.47 mas $yr^{-1}$ and $\mu_{\alpha^\ast}$= -2.61 $\pm$ 1.27 mas $yr^{-1}$ , $\mu_{\delta}$=
-5.23 $\pm$0.74 mas $yr^{-1}$ for FSR 19 and FSR 25, respectively. }

We present an estimation of lifetimes of massive galaxies with distinct UV colors at $0.5 \le z \le
2.5$ in the COSMOS/UltraVISTA field. After dividing the galaxy sample into subsamples of red sequence
(RS), blue cloud (BC), and green valley (GV) galaxies in different redshift bins, according to their
rest-frame extinction-corrected UV colors, we derive their lifetimes using clustering analyses.
Several essentials that may influence the lifetime estimation have been explored, including the
dark matter (DM) halo mass function (HMF), the width of redshift bin, the growth of DM halos within
each redshift bin, and the stellar mass. We find that the HMF difference results in scatters of $\sim0.2$
dex on lifetime estimation; adopting a redshift bin width of $\Delta z = 0.5$ is good enough to estimate
the lifetime; and no significant effect on lifetime estimation is found due to the growth of DM halos
within each redshift bin. The galaxy subsamples with higher stellar masses generally have shorter
lifetimes; however, the lifetimes among different subsamples at z > 1:5 tend to be independent of
stellar mass. Consistently, the clustering-based lifetime for each galaxy subsample agrees well
with that inferred using the spectral energy distribution modeling. Moreover, the lifetimes of
the RS and BC galaxies also coincide well with their typical gas depletion timescales attributed
to the consumption of star formation. Interestingly, the distinct lifetime behaviors of the GV
galaxies at $z \le 1.5$ and $z>1.5$ can not be fully accounted for by their gas depletion timescales.
Instead, this discrepancy between the lifetimes and gas depletion timescales of the GV galaxies
suggests that there are additional physical processes, such as feedback of active galactic nuclei,
accelerating the quenching of GV galaxies at high redshifts.

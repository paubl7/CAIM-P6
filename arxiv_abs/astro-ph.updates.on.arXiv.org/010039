Despite over 50 years of research, many open questions remain about the origin and nature of GRBs.
Polarization measurements of the prompt emission of these extreme phenomena have long been thought
to be the key to answering a range of these questions. The POLAR detector was designed to produce the
first set of detailed and reliable polarization measurements in an energy range of approximately
50-500 keV. During late 2016 and early 2017, POLAR detected a total of 55 GRBs. Analysis results of
5 of these GRBs have been reported in the past. The results were found to be consistent with a low or
unpolarized flux. However, previous reports by other collaborations found high levels of polarization.
We study the polarization for all the 14 GRBs observed by POLAR for which statistically robust inferences
are possible. Additionally, time-resolved polarization studies are performed on GRBs with sufficient
apparent flux. A publicly available polarization analysis tool, developed within the 3ML framework,
was used to produce statistically robust results. The method allows to combine spectral and polarimetric
data from POLAR with spectral data from the Fermi GBM and Swift-BAT to jointly model the spectral
and polarimetric parameters. The time integrated analysis finds all results to be compatible with
a low or zero polarization with the caveat that, when time-resolved analysis is possible within
individual pulses, we observe moderate polarization with a rapidly changing polarization angle.
Thus, time-integrated polarization results, while pointing to lower polarization are potentially
an artifact of summing over the changing polarization signal and thus, washing out the true moderate
polarization. Therefore, we caution against over interpretation of any time-integrated results
and encourage one to wait for more detailed polarization measurements from forthcoming missions
such as POLAR-2 and LEAP.

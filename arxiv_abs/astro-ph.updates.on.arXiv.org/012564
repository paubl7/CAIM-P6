We study the relations between the mass of the central black hole (BH) $M_{\rm BH}$, the dark matter
halo mass $M_{\rm h}$, and the stellar-to-halo mass fraction $f_\star\propto M_\star/M_{\rm
h}$ in a sample of $55$ nearby galaxies with dynamically measured $M_{\rm BH}>10^6\,{\rm M}_\odot$
and $M_{\rm h}>5\times10^{11}\,{\rm M}_\odot$. The main improvement with respect to previous
studies is that we consider both early- and late-type systems for which $M_{\rm h}$ is determined
either from globular cluster dynamics or from spatially resolved rotation curves. Independently
of their structural properties, galaxies in our sample build a well defined sequence in the $M_{\rm
BH}$-$M_{\rm h}$-$f_\star$ space. We find that: (i) $M_{\rm h}$ and $M_{\rm BH}$ strongly correlate
with each other and anti-correlate with $f_\star$; (ii) there is a break in the slope of the $M_{\rm
BH}$-$M_{\rm h}$ relation at $M_{\rm h}$ of $10^{12}\,{\rm M}_\odot$, and in the $f_\star$-$M_{\rm
BH}$ relation at $M_{\rm BH}$ of $\sim10^7\!-\!10^8\,{\rm M}_\odot$; (iii) at a fixed $M_{\rm
BH}$, galaxies with a larger $f_\star$ tend to occupy lighter halos and to have later morphological
types. We show that the observed trends can be reproduced by a simple equilibrium model in the $\Lambda$CDM
framework where galaxies smoothly accrete dark and baryonic matter at a cosmological rate, having
their stellar and black hole build-up regulated both by the cooling of the available gas reservoir
and by the negative feedback from star formation and active galactic nuclei (AGN). Feature (ii)
arises as the BH population transits from a rapidly accreting phase to a more gentle and self-regulated
growth, while scatter in the AGN feedback efficiency can account for feature (iii).

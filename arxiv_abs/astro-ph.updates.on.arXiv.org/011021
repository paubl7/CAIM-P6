Black hole X-ray binaries in the quiescent state (Eddington ratios typically $\lesssim$10$^{-5}$)
display softer X-ray spectra (photon indices $\Gamma\sim2$) compared to higher-luminosity black
hole X-ray binaries in the hard state ($\Gamma\sim1.7$). However, the cause of this softening,
and its implications for the underlying accretion flow, are still uncertain. Here, we present quasi-simultaneous
X-ray and radio spectral monitoring of the black hole X-ray binary MAXI J1820$+$070 during the decay
of its 2018 outburst and of a subsequent re-flare in 2019, providing an opportunity to monitor a black
hole X-ray binary as it actively transitions into quiescence. We probe 1-10 keV X-ray luminosities
as low as $L_{\rm X}\sim4\times10^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$, equivalent to Eddington fractions of $\sim4\times10^{-7}$.
During its decay towards quiescence, the X-ray spectrum of MAXI J1820$+$070 softens from $\Gamma\sim1.7$
to $\Gamma\sim2$, with the softening taking $\sim30$d, and completing at $L_{\rm X}\approx10^{34}$
erg s$^{-1}$ ($\approx10^{-5} L_{\rm Edd}$). While the X-ray spectrum softens, the radio spectrum
generally remains flat/inverted throughout the decay. We also find that MAXI J1820$+$070 follows
a radio ($L_{\rm R}$) -- X-ray luminosity correlation of the form $L_{\rm R} \propto L_{\rm X}^{0.52\pm0.07}$,
making it the fourth black hole system to follow the so-called `standard track' unbroken over several
(in this case, four) decades in $L_{\rm X}$. Comparing the radio/X-ray spectral evolution(s) with
the $L_{\rm R}$ -- $L_{\rm X}$ plane, we find that the X-ray softening is consistent with X-rays produced
by Comptonization processes in a radiatively inefficient accretion flow. We generally disfavor
X-ray emission originating solely from within the jet, with the possible exception of X-rays produced
via synchrotron self-Compton processes.

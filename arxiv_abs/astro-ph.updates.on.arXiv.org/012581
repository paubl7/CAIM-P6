Space observatories have provided unprecedented depictions of the many variability behaviors
typical of low-mass, young stars. However, those studies have so far largely omitted more massive
objects ($\sim$2 $M_\odot$ to 4-5 $M_\odot$), and were limited by the absence of simultaneous,
multi-wavelength information. We present a new study of young star variability in the $\sim$1-2
Myr-old, massive Lagoon Nebula region. Our sample encompasses 278 young, late-B to K-type stars,
monitored with Kepler/K2. Auxiliary $u,g,r,i,H\alpha$ time series photometry, simultaneous
with K2, was acquired at the Paranal Observatory. We employed this comprehensive dataset and archival
infrared photometry to determine individual stellar parameters, assess the presence of circumstellar
disks, and tie the variability behaviors to inner disk dynamics. We found significant mass-dependent
trends in variability properties, with B/A stars displaying substantially reduced levels of variability
compared to G/K stars for any light curve morphology. These properties suggest different magnetic
field structures at the surface of early-type and later-type stars. We also detected a dearth of
some disk-driven variability behaviors, particularly dippers, among stars earlier than G. This
indicates that their higher surface temperatures and more chaotic magnetic fields prevent the
formation and survival of inner disk dust structures co-rotating with the star. Finally, we examined
the characteristic variability timescales within each light curve, and determined that the day-to-week
timescales are predominant over the K2 time series. These reflect distinct processes and locations
in the inner disk environment, from intense accretion triggered by instabilities in the innermost
disk regions, to variable accretion efficiency in the outer magnetosphere.

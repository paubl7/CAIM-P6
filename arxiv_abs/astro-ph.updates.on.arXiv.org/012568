The Neil Gehrels Swift observatory observe Gamma-Ray bursts (GRBs) plateaus in X-rays. We test
the reliability of the closure relations through the fireball model when dealing with the GRB plateau
emission. We analyze 455 X-ray lightcurves (LCs) collected by \emph{Swift} from 2005 (January)
until 2019 (August) for which the redshift is both known and unknown using the phenomenological
Willingale 2007 model. Using these fits, we analyze the emission mechanisms and astrophysical
environments of these GRBs through the closure relations within the time interval of the plateau
emission. Finally, we test the 3D fundamental plane relation (Dainotti relation) which connects
the prompt peak luminosity, the time at the end of the plateau (rest-frame), and the luminosity at
that time, on the GRBs with redshift, concerning groups determined by the closure relations. This
allows us to check if the intrinsic scatter \sigma_{int} of any of these groups is reduced compared
to previous literature. The most fulfilled environments for the electron spectral distribution,
p>2, are Wind Slow Cooling (SC) and ISM Slow Cooling for cases in which the parameter q, which indicates
the flatness of the plateau emission and accounts for the energy injection, is =0 and =0.5, respectively,
both in the cases with known and unknown redshifts. We also find that for the sGRBs All ISM Environments
with $q=0$ have the smallest \sigma_{int}=0.04 \pm 0.15 in terms of the fundamental plane relation
holding a probability of occurring by chance of p=0.005. We have shown that the majority of GRBs presenting
the plateau emission fulfil the closure relations, including the energy injection, with a particular
preference for the Wind SC environment. The subsample of GRBs that fulfil given relations can be
used as possible standard candles and can suggest a way to reduce the intrinsic scatter of these studied
relationships.

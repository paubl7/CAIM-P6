We discuss in a thermodynamic, geologically empirical way the long-term nature of the stable majority
ices that could be present in Kuiper Belt Object 2014 MU69 after its 4.6 Gyr residence in the EKB as
a cold classical object. Considering the stability versus sublimation into vacuum for the suite
of ices commonly found on comets, Centaurs, and KBOs at the average ~40K sunlit surface temperature
of MU69 over Myr to Gyr, we find only 3 common ices that are truly refractory: HCN, CH3OH, and H2O (in
order of increasing stability). NH3 and H2CO ices are marginally stable and may be removed by any
positive temperature excursions in the EKB, as produced every 1e8 - 1e9 yrs by nearby supernovae
and passing O/B stars. To date the NH team has reported the presence of abundant CH3OH and evidence
for H2O on MU69s surface (Lisse et al. 2017, Grundy et al. 2020). NH3 has been searched for, but not
found. We predict that future absorption feature detections will be due to an HCN or poly-H2CO based
species. Consideration of the conditions present in the EKB region during the formation era of MU69
lead us to infer that it formed "in the dark", in an optically thick mid-plane, unable to see the nascent,
variable, highly luminous Young Stellar Object-TTauri Sun, and that KBOs contain HCN and CH3OH
ice phases in addition to the H2O ice phases found in their Short Period comet descendants. Finally,
when we apply our ice thermal stability analysis to bodies/populations related to MU69, we find
that methanol ice may be ubiquitous in the outer solar system; that if Pluto is not a fully differentiated
body, then it must have gained its hypervolatile ices from proto-planetary disk sources in the first
few Myr of the solar systems existence; and that hypervolatile rich, highly primordial comet C/2016
R2 was placed onto an Oort Cloud orbit on a similar timescale.

Due to the fact that HI mass measurements are not available for large galaxy samples at high redshifts,
we apply a photometric estimator of the HI-to-stellar mass ratio (M_HI/M_*) calibrated using a
local Universe sample of galaxies to a sample of galaxies at z ~ 1 in the DEEP2 survey. We use these HI
mass estimates to calculate HI mass functions (HIMFs) and cosmic HI mass densities (Omega_HI),
and to examine the correlation between star formation rate and HI gas content, for galaxies at z ~
1. We have estimated HI gas masses for ~ 7,000 galaxies in the DEEP2 survey with redshifts in the range
0.75 < z < 1.4 and stellar masses M_* > 10^{10} M_solar, using a combination of the rest-frame ultraviolet-optical
colour (NUV - r) and stellar mass density (mu_*) as a way to estimate M_HI/M_*. It is found that the
high mass end of high-z HI mass function (HIMF) is quite similar to that of the local HIMF. The lower
limit of Omega_HI,limit = 2.1 * 10^{-4} h_70^{-1}, obtained by directly integrating the HI mass
of galaxies with M_* > 10^{10} M_solar, confirms that massive star-forming galaxies do not dominate
the neutral gas at z ~ 1. We study the evolution of the HI mass to stellar mass ratio from z ~ 1 to today
and find a steeper relation between HI gas mass fraction and stellar mass at higher redshifts. Specifically,
galaxies with M_* = 10^{11} M_solar at z ~ 1 are found to have 3 - 4 times higher neutral gas fractions
than local galaxies, while the increase is as high as 4 - 12 times at M_* = 10^{10} M_solar. The quantity
M_HI/SFR exhibits very large scatter, and the scatter increases from a factor of 5 - 7 at z = 0 to factors
close to a hundred at z = 1. This implies that there is no relation between HI gas and star formation
in high redshift galaxies. The HI gas must be linked to cosmological gas accretion processes at high
redshifts.

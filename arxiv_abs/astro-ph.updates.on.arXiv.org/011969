Astrochemistry lies at the nexus of astronomy, chemistry, and molecular physics. On the basis of
precise laboratory data, a rich collection of more than 200 familiar and exotic molecules have been
identified in the interstellar medium, the vast majority by their unique rotational fingerprint.
Despite this large body of work, there is scant evidence in the radio band for the basic building blocks
of chemistry on earth -- five and six-membered rings -- despite long standing and sustained efforts
during the past 50 years. In contrast, a peculiar structural motif, highly unsaturated carbon in
a chain-like arrangement, is instead quite common in space. The recent astronomical detection
of cyanobenzene, the simplest aromatic nitrile, in the dark molecular cloud TMC-1, and soon afterwards
in additional pre-stellar, and possibly protostellar sources, establishes that aromatic chemistry
is likely widespread in the earliest stages of star formation. The subsequent discovery of cyanocyclopentadienes
and even cyanonapthlenes in TMC-1 provides further evidence that organic molecules of considerable
complexity are readily synthesized in regions with high visual extinction but where the low temperature
and pressure are remarkably low. This review focuses on laboratory efforts now underway to understand
the rich transition region between linear and planar carbon structures using microwave spectroscopy.
We present key features, advantages, and disadvantages of current detection methods, a discussion
of the types of molecules found in space and in the laboratory, and approaches under development
to identify entirely new species in complex mixtures. Studies focusing on the cyanation of hydrocarbons
and the formation of benzene from acyclic precursors are highlighted, as is the role that isotopic
studies might play in elucidating the chemical pathways to ring formation.

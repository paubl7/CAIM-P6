We present a new determination of the galaxy stellar mass function (GSMF) over the redshift interval
$0.25 \leq z \leq 3.75$, derived from a combination of ground-based and Hubble Space Telescope (HST)
imaging surveys. Based on a near-IR selected galaxy sample selected over an area of 3 deg$^{2}$ and
spanning $\geq 4$ dex in stellar mass, we fit the GSMF with both single and double Schechter functions,
carefully accounting for Eddington bias to derive both observed and intrinsic parameter values.
We find that a double Schechter function is a better fit to the GSMF at all redshifts, although the
single and double Schechter function fits are statistically indistinguishable by $z=3.25$. We
find no evidence for significant evolution in $M^{\star}$, with the intrinsic value consistent
with $\log_{10}(M^{\star} / M_{\odot})=10.55\pm{0.1}$ over the full redshift range. Overall,
our determination of the GSMF is in good agreement with recent simulation results, although differences
persist at the highest stellar masses. Splitting our sample according to location on the UVJ plane,
we find that the star-forming GSMF can be adequately described by a single Schechter function over
the full redshift range, and has not evolved significantly since $z\simeq 2.5$. In contrast, both
the normalization and functional form of the passive GSMF evolves dramatically with redshift,
switching from a single to a double Schechter function at $z \leq 1.5$. As a result, we find that while
passive galaxies dominate the integrated stellar-mass density at $z \leq 0.75$, they only contribute
$\lesssim 10$ per cent by $z\simeq 3$. Finally, we provide a simple parameterization that provides
an accurate estimate of the GSMF, both observed and intrinsic, at any redshift within the range $0
\leq z \leq 4$.

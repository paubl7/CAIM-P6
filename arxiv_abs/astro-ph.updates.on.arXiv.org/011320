A crucial phase during planetary growth is the migration when the planetary core has been assembled,
but the planet did not open a deep gap yet. During this phase the planet is subject to fast type-I migration,
which is mostly directed inwards, and the planet can lose a significant fraction of its semi-major
axis. The duration of this phase is set by how long the planetary envelope needs to contract until
it reaches a mass similar to the mass of the planetary core, which is when runaway gas accretion can
set in and the planet can open a deeper gap in the disc, transitioning into the slower type-II migration.
This envelope contraction phase depends crucially on the planetary mass and on the opacity inside
the planetary envelope. Here we study how different opacity prescriptions influence the envelope
contraction time and how this in turn influences how far the planet migrates through the disc. We
find within our simulations that the size distribution of the grains as well as the chemical composition
of the grains crucially influences how far the planet migrates before it can reach the runaway gas
accretion phase. Grain size distributions with larger grain sizes result in less inward migration
of the growing planet, due to faster gas accretion enabled by more efficient cooling. In addition,
we find that planets forming in water poor environments can contract their envelope faster and thus
migrate less, implying that gas giants forming in water poor environments might be located further
away from their central star compared to gas giants forming in water rich environments. Future studies
of planet formation that aim to investigate the chemical composition of formed gas giants need to
take these effects self consistently into account.

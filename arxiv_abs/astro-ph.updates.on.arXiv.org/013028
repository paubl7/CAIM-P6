In all inflationary scenarios of primordial black holes (PBH) formation, amplified scalar perturbations
inevitably accompany an induced stochastic gravitational waves background (ISGWB) at smaller
scales. In this paper, we study the ISGWB originating from the inflationary model, introduced in
our previous paper [1] wherein PBHs can be produced with a nearly monochromatic mass fraction in
the asteroid mass window accounting for the total dark matter in the universe. We numerically calculate
the ISGWB in our scenario for frequencies ranging from nanoHz to KHz that covers the observational
scales corresponding to future space based GW observatories such as IPTA, LISA, DECIGO and ET. Interestingly,
we find that ultralight PBHs ($M_{\rm PBH} \sim 10^{-20} M_\odot$) which shall completely evaporate
by today with exceedingly small contribution to dark matter, would still generate an ISGWB that
may be detected by a future design of the ground based Advanced LIGO detector. Using a model independent
approach, we obtain a stringent lower mass limit for ultralight PBHs which would be valid for a large
class of ultra slow roll inflationary models. Further, we extend our formalism to study the imprints
of a reheating epoch on both the ISGWB and the derived lower mass bound. We find that any non-instantaneous
reheating leads to an even stronger lower bound on PBHs mass and an epoch of a prolonged matter dominated
reheating shifts the ISGWB spectrum to smaller frequencies. In particular, we show that an epoch
of an early matter dominated phase leads to a secondary amplification of ISGWB at much smaller scales
corresponding to the smallest comoving scale leaving the horizon during inflation or the end of
inflation scale. Finally, we discuss the prospects of the ISGWB detection by the proposed and upcoming
GW observatories.

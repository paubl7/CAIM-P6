Galaxy clusters identified from the Sunyaev Zel'dovich (SZ) effect are a key ingredient in multi-wavelength
cluster-based cosmology. We present a comparison between two methods of cluster identification:
the standard Matched Filter (MF) method in SZ cluster finding and a method using Convolutional Neural
Networks (CNN). We further implement and show results for a `combined' identifier. We apply the
methods to simulated millimeter maps for several observing frequencies for an SPT-3G-like survey.
There are some key differences between the methods. The MF method requires image pre-processing
to remove point sources and a model for the noise, while the CNN method requires very little pre-processing
of images. Additionally, the CNN requires tuning of hyperparameters in the model and takes as input,
cutout images of the sky. Specifically, we use the CNN to classify whether or not an 8 arcmin $\times$
8 arcmin cutout of the sky contains a cluster. We compare differences in purity and completeness.
The MF signal-to-noise ratio depends on both mass and redshift. Our CNN, trained for a given mass
threshold, captures a different set of clusters than the MF, some of which have SNR below the MF detection
threshold. However, the CNN tends to mis-classify cutouts whose clusters are located near the edge
of the cutout, which can be mitigated with staggered cutouts. We leverage the complementarity of
the two methods, combining the scores from each method for identification. The purity and completeness
of the MF alone are both 0.61, assuming a standard detection threshold. The purity and completeness
of the CNN alone are 0.59 and 0.61. The combined classification method yields 0.60 and 0.77, a significant
increase for completeness with a modest decrease in purity. We advocate for combined methods that
increase the confidence of many lower signal-to-noise clusters.

Direct $N$-body simulations of star clusters are accurate but expensive largely due to the numerous
$\mathcal{O} (N^2)$ pairwise force calculations. State-of-the-art $N$-body codes can take nearly
6 months of computer wall time to simulate a single $N=10^6$ globular cluster over a single relaxation
time. To solve the post-million body problem, it will be necessary to use approximated force solvers,
such as tree codes. In this work, we adapt a tree-based, optimized Fast Multipole Method (FMM) to
the collisional $N$-body problem. The use of a rotation-accelerated translation operator and
an error-controlled cell opening criteria leads to a code which can be tuned to arbitrary accuracy.
We demonstrate that our code, Taichi, can be as accurate as direct summation when $N> 10^4$. This
opens up the possibility of performing large-$N$, star-by-star simulations of massive stellar
clusters, and would permit large parameter space studies that would require years with the current
generation of direct summation codes. Using a series of tests and idealized models, we show that
Taichi can accurately model collisional effects, such as dynamical friction and the core-collapse
time of idealized clusters, producing results in strong agreement with benchmarks from other collisional
codes such as NBODY6++GPU or PeTar. Parallelized using OpenMP and AVX, Taichi is nearly 70 times
faster on a 28-core single machine than its direct integration counterpart. With future improvements
to the handling of close encounters and binary evolution, we clearly demonstrate the potential
of an optimized FMM for the modelling of collisional stellar systems, opening the door to accurate
simulations of massive globular clusters, super star clusters, and even galactic nuclei.

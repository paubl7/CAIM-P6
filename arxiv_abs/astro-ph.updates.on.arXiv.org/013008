We present a systematic study of the diffuse hot gas around early-type galaxies (ETGs) residing
in the Virgo cluster, based on archival {\it Chandra} observations. Our representative sample
consists of 79 galaxies with low-to-intermediate stellar masses ($M_* \approx 10^{9-11}\rm~M_\odot$),
a mass range that has not been extensively explored with X-ray observations thus far. We detect diffuse
X-ray emission in only eight galaxies and find that in five cases a substantial fraction of the detected
emission can be unambiguously attributed to truly diffuse hot gas, based on their spatial distribution
and spectral properties. For the individually non-detected galaxies, we constrain their average
X-ray emission by performing a stacking analysis, finding a specific X-ray luminosity of $L_{\rm
X}/M_* \sim 10^{28}{\rm~erg~s^{-1}~M_{\odot}^{-1}}$, which is consistent with unresolved
stellar populations. The apparent paucity of truly diffuse hot gas in these low- and intermediate-mass
ETGs may be the result of efficient ram pressure stripping by the hot intra-cluster medium. However,
we also find no significant diffuse hot gas in a comparison sample of 57 field ETGs of similar stellar
masses, for which archival {\it Chandra} observations with similar sensitivity are available.
This points to the alternative possibility that galactic winds evacuate the hot gas from the inner
region of low- and intermediate-mass ETGs, regardless of the galactic environment. Nevertheless,
we do find strong morphological evidence for on-going ram pressure stripping in two galaxies (NGC
4417 and NGC 4459). A better understanding of the roles of ram pressure stripping and galactic winds
in regulating the hot gas content of ETGs, invites sensitive X-ray observations for a large galaxy
sample.

The IR emission of dust heated by stars provides critical information for galaxy evolution studies.
Unfortunately, observations are often limited to the MIR, making templates a necessity. Previously
published templates were based on small samples of luminous galaxies, not necessarily representative
of normal star-forming galaxies. We construct new dust templates, including instrument-specific
relations and software tools that facilitate the estimation of the TIR luminosity and SFR based
on one or several fluxes up to z=4. For the first time the templates include a dependence on both TIR
luminosity and the sSFR, thereby increasing their reliability and utility. We also provide formulae
for calculating TIR luminosities and SFR from JWST F2100W observations at 0<z<2. Our templates
are based on 2584 normal star-forming galaxies spanning a wide range of stellar mass and sSFR, including
sSFRs typical at higher redshifts. IR spectra and properties are obtained using CIGALE and the Draine
& Li (2007) dust models. The photometry from the GALEX-SDSS-WISE Legacy Catalog is supplemented
with 2MASS and H-ATLAS, from FUV to 500 microns. The shape of the dust spectrum varies with TIR luminosity,
but also independently with sSFR. Remarkably precise estimates of the dust luminosity are possible
with a single band over the rest-frame 12-17 and 55-130 microns. We validate single-band estimates
on diverse populations, including local LIRGs, and find no significant systematic errors. Using
two or more bands simultaneously yields unbiased estimation of the TIR luminosity even of star-forming
dwarfs. We obtain fresh insights regarding the interplay between monochromatic IR luminosities,
spectral shapes and physical properties, and construct new templates and estimators of the dust
luminosity and SFR. We provide software for generating templates and estimating these quantities
based on 1-4 bands up to z=4.

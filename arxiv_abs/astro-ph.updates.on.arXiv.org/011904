Deep rest-optical observations are required to accurately constrain the stellar populations
of $z\sim8$ galaxies. Due to significant limitations in the availability of such data for statistically
complete samples, observational results have been limited to modest numbers of bright or lensed
sources. To revolutionize the present characterization of $z\sim8$ galaxies, we exploit the ultradeep
($\sim27$ mag, $3\sigma$) Spitzer/IRAC $3.6\mu$m and $4.5\mu$m data, probing the rest-frame
optical at $z\sim8$, over $\sim200$ arcmin$^2$ of the GOODS fields from the recently completed
GOODS Re-ionization Era wide-Area Treasury from Spitzer (GREATS) program, combined with observations
in the CANDELS UDS and COSMOS fields. We stacked $\gtrsim100$ $z\sim8$ Lyman-Break galaxies in
four bins of UV luminosity ($M_\mathrm{UV}\sim -20.7$ to $-18.4$) and study their $H_\mathrm{160}-[3.6]$
and $[3.6]-[4.5]$ colors. We find young ages ($\lesssim100$ Myr) for the three faintest stacks,
inferred from their blue $H_\mathrm{160}-[3.6]\sim 0$ mag colors, consistent with a negative
Balmer break. Meanwhile, the redder $H_\mathrm{160}-[3.6]$ color seen in the brightest stack
is suggestive of slightly older ages. We explored the existence of a correlation between the UV luminosity
and age, and find either no trend or fainter galaxies being younger. The stacked SEDs also exhibit
very red $[3.6]-[4.5]\sim0.5$ mag colors, indicative of intense [OIII]+H$\beta$ nebular emission
and SFR. The correspondingly high specific star-formation rates, sSFR$\gtrsim10$Gyr$^{-1}$,
are consistent with recent determinations at similar redshifts and higher luminosities, and support
the co-evolution between the sSFR and the specific halo mass accretion rate.

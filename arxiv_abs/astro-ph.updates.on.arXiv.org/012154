We use VANDELS spectroscopic data overlapping with the $\simeq$7 Ms Chandra Deep Field South survey
to extend studies of high-mass X-ray binary systems (XRBs) in 301 normal star-forming galaxies
in the redshift range $3 < z < 5.5$. Our analysis evaluates correlations between X-ray luminosities
($L_X$), star formation rates (SFR) and stellar metallicities ($Z_\star$) to higher redshifts
and over a wider range in galaxy properties than hitherto. Using a stacking analysis performed in
bins of both redshift and SFR for sources with robust spectroscopic redshifts without AGN signatures,
we find convincing evolutionary trends in the ratio $L_X$/SFR to the highest redshifts probed,
with a stronger trend for galaxies with lower SFRs. Combining our data with published samples at
lower redshift, the evolution of $L_X$/SFR to $z\simeq5$ proceeds as $(1 + z)^{1.03 \pm 0.02}$.
Using stellar metallicities derived from photospheric absorption features in our spectroscopic
data, we confirm indications at lower redshifts that $L_X$/SFR is stronger for metal-poor galaxies.
We use semi-analytic models to show that metallicity dependence of $L_X$/SFR alone may not be sufficient
to fully explain the observed redshift evolution of X-ray emission from high-mass XRBs, particularly
for galaxies with SFR $<30$ $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. We speculate that the discrepancy may arise due
to reduced overall stellar ages in the early Universe leading to higher $L_X$/SFR for the same metallicity.
We use our data to define the redshift-dependent contribution of XRBs to the integrated X-ray luminosity
density and, in comparison with models, find that the contribution of high-mass XRBs to the cosmic
X-ray background at $z>6$ may be $\gtrsim 0.25$ dex higher than previously estimated.

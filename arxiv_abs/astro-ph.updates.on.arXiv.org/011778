Supernova remnants (SNRs) are observable for about 6-15x10^4 years before they fade into the Galactic
interstellar medium. With a Galactic supernova rate of approximately two per century, we can expect
to have of the order of 1200 SNRs in our Galaxy. However, only about 300 of them are known to date, with
the majority having been discovered in Galactic plane radio surveys. Given that these SNRs represent
the brightest tail of the distribution and are mostly located close to the plane, they are not representative
of the complete sample. Here we report findings from the search for new SNRs in the eROSITA all-sky
survey data which led to the detection of one of the largest SNRs discovered at wavelengths other
than the radio: G249.5+24.5. This source is located at a relatively high Galactic latitude, where
SNRs are not usually expected to be found. The remnant, 'Hoinga', has a diameter of about 4.4 degrees
and shows a circular shaped morphology with diffuse X-ray emission filling almost the entire remnant.
Spectral analysis of the remnant emission reveals that an APEC spectrum from collisionally ionised
diffuse gas and a plane-parallel shock plasma model with non-equilibrium ionisation are both able
to provide an adequate description of the data, suggesting a gas temperature of the order of kT = 0.1
keV and an absorbing column density of N_H=3.6 x 10^20 cm^-2. Subsequent searches for a radio counterpart
of the Hoinga remnant identified its radio emission in archival data from the Continuum HI Parkes
All-Sky Survey (CHIPASS) and the 408-MHz `Haslam' all-sky survey. The radio spectral index alpha=-0.69
+- 0.08 obtained from these data definitely confirms the SNR nature of Hoinga. From its size and X-ray
and radio spectral properties we conclude that Hoinga is a middle-aged Vela-like SNR located at
a distance of about twice that of the Vela SNR, i.e. at ~500 pc.

Galaxy morphologies, kinematics, and stellar populations are thought to link to each other. However,
both simulations and observations have pointed out mismatches therein. In this work, we study the
nature and origin of the present-day quenched, bulge-dominated, but dynamically cold galaxies
within a stellar mass range of $10.3<\log\,M_{\ast}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}<11.2$ in the IllustrisTNG-100
Simulation, as a companion paper of Lu et al.(2021), which aimed at the star-forming but dynamically
hot disc galaxies within a lower stellar mass range of $9.7<\log\,M_{\ast}/\mathrm{M_{\odot}}<10.3$.
We compare cold quenched population with a population of normal star-forming dynamically cold
disc galaxies and a population of normal quenched dynamically hot elliptical galaxies within the
same mass range. The populations of the present-day quenched and bulge-dominated galaxies (both
being dynamically cold and hot) used to have significantly higher star-formation rates and thinner
morphologies at redshifts of z~2. They have experienced more frequent larger mass-ratio mergers
below z~0.7 in comparison to their star-forming disc counterparts, which is responsible for the
formation of their bulge-dominated morphologies. The dynamically cold populations (both being
star-forming and quenched) have experienced more frequent prograde and tangential mergers especially
below z~1, in contrast to the dynamically hot ellipticals, which have had more retrograde and radial
mergers. Such different merging histories can well explain the differences on the cold and hot dynamical
status among these galaxies. We point out that the real-world counterparts of these dynamically
cold and hot bulge-dominated quenched populations are the fast- and slow-rotating early-type
galaxies, respectively, as seen in observations and hence reveal the different evolution paths
of these two distinct populations of early-type galaxies.

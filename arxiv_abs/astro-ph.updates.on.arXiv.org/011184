The Serpens filament, a prominent elongated structure in a relatively nearby molecular cloud,
is believed to be at an early evolutionary stage, so studying its physical and chemical properties
can shed light on filament formation and early evolution. The main goal is to address the physical
and chemical properties as well as the dynamical state of the Serpens filament at a spatial resolution
of $\sim$0.07 pc and a spectral resolution of $\lesssim$0.1~km~s$^{-1}$. We performed $^{13}$CO
(1--0), C$^{18}$O (1--0), C$^{17}$O (1--0), $^{13}$CO (2--1), C$^{18}$O (2--1), and C$^{17}$O
(2--1) imaging observations toward the Serpens filament with the Institut de Radioastronomie
Millim{\'e}trique 30-m (IRAM-30 m) and Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX) telescopes. Widespread
narrow $^{13}$CO (2--1) self-absorption is observed in this filament, causing the $^{13}$CO morphology
to be different from the filamentary structure traced by C$^{18}$O and C$^{17}$O. Our excitation
analysis suggests that the opacities of C$^{18}$O transitions become higher than unity in most
regions, and this analysis confirms the presence of widespread CO depletion. Further we show that
the local velocity gradients have a tendency to be perpendicular to the filament's long axis in the
outskirts and parallel to the large-scale magnetic field direction. The magnitudes of the local
velocity gradients decrease toward the filament's crest. The observed velocity structure can
be a result of gravity-driven accretion flows. The isochronic evolutionary track of the C$^{18}$O
freeze-out process indicates the filament is young with an age of $\lesssim$2 Myr. We propose that
the Serpens filament is a newly-formed slightly-supercritical structure which appears to be actively
accreting material from its ambient gas.

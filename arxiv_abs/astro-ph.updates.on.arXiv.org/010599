The composition of Solar System surfaces can be inferred through reflectance and emission spectroscopy,
by comparing these observations to laboratory measurements and radiative transfer models. While
several populations of objects appear to be covered by sub-micrometre sized particles (referred
to as hyperfine), there are limited studies on reflectance and emission of particulate surfaces
composed of particles smaller than the visible and infrared wavelengths. We have undertaken an
effort to determine the reflectance of hyperfine particulate surfaces in conjunction with high-porosity,
in order to simulate the physical state of cometary surfaces and their related asteroids (P- and
D-types). In this work, we present a technique developed to produce hyperfine particles of astrophysical
relevant materials. Hyperfine powders were prepared and measured in reflectance in the 0.4-2.6
micrometer range. These powders were then included in water ice particles, sublimated under vacuum,
in order to produce a hyperporous sample of hyperfine material. When grinded below one micrometre,
the four materials studied (olivine, smectite, pyroxene and amorphous silica), show strong decrease
of their absorption features together with a blueing of the spectra. This small grain degeneracy
implies that surfaces covered by hyperfine grains should show only shallow absorption features
if any. These two effects, decrease of band depth and spectral blueing, appear magnified when the
grains are incorporated in the hyperporous residue. We interpret the distinct behaviour between
hyperporous and more compact surfaces by the distancing of individual grains and a decrease in the
size of the elemental scatterers. This work implies that hyperfine grains are unabundant at the
surfaces of S- or V-type asteroids, and that the blue nature of B-type may be related to a physical
effect rather than a compositional effect.

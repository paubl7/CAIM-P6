Aims: Our goal is to develop methodologies to seamlessly track transient solar wind flows viewed
by coronagraphs or heliospheric imagers from rapidly varying viewpoints. Methods: We constructed
maps of intensity versus time and elongation (J-maps) from Parker Solar Probe (PSP) Wide-field
Imager (WISPR) observations during the fourth encounter of PSP. From the J-map, we built an intensity
on impact-radius-on-Thomson-surface map (R-map). Finally, we constructed a latitudinal intensity
versus time map (Lat-map). Our methodology satisfactorily addresses the challenges associated
with the construction of such maps from data taken from rapidly varying viewpoint observations.
Results: Our WISPR J-map exhibits several tracks, corresponding to transient solar wind flows
ranging from a coronal mass ejection (CME) down to streamer blobs. The latter occurrence rate is
about 4-5 per day, which is similar to the occurrence rate in a J-map made from $\sim1$ AU data obtained
with the Heliospheric Imager-1 (HI-1) on board the Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory Ahead
spacecraft (STEREO-A). STEREO-A was radially aligned with PSP during the study period. The WISPR
J-map tracks correspond to angular speeds of $2.28 \pm 0.7$$^{\circ}$/hour ($2.49 \pm 0.95$$^{\circ}$/hour),
for linear (quadratic) time-elongation fittings, and radial speeds of about 150-300 km s$^{-1}$.
The analysis of the Lat-map reveals a bifurcating streamer, which implies that PSP was flying through
a slightly folded streamer during perihelion. Conclusions: We developed a framework to systematically
capture and characterize transient solar wind flows from space platforms with rapidly varying
vantage points. The methodology can be applied to PSP WISPR observations as well as to upcoming observations
from instruments on board the Solar Orbiter mission.

We extended the modified Lemaitre-Tolman model taking into account the effect of angular momentum
and dynamical friction. The inclusion of these quantities in the equation of motion modifies the
evolution of a perturbation, initially moving with the Hubble flow. Solving the equation of motions
we got the relationships between mass, $M$, and the turn-around radius, $R_0$. Knowing $R_0$, the
quoted relation allows the determination of the mass of the object studied. The relationships for
the case in which also the angular momentum is taken into account gives a mass $\simeq 90$ \% larger
than the standard Lemaitre-Tolman model, and two times the value of the standard Lemaitre-Tolman
model, in the case also dynamical friction is taken into account. As a second step, we found relationships
between the velocity, $v$, and radius, $R$, and fitted them to data of the Local Group, M81, NGC 253,
IC342, CenA/M83, and to the Virgo clusters obtained by Ref.[New Astronomy 11(4):325, A&A 488(3):845].
This allowed us to find optimized values of the mass and Hubble constant of the objects studied. The
fit gives values of the masses smaller with respect to the $M-R_0$ relationship method, but in any
case 30-40\% larger than the $v-R$ relationship obtained from the standard Lemaitre-Tolman model.
Differently from mass, the Hubble parameter becomes smaller with respect to the standard Lemaitre-Tolman
model, when angular momentum, and dynamical friction are introduced. This is in agreement with
Ref.[New Astronomy 11(4):325, A&A 488(3):845], who improved the standard Lemaitre-Tolman model
taking into account the cosmological constant. Finally, we used the mass, $M$, and $R_0$ of the studied
objects to put constraints to the dark energy equation of state parameter, $w$. Comparison with
previous studies show different constraints on $w$.

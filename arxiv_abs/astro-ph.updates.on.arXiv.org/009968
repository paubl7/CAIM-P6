We present a comprehensive analysis of the performance of noise-reduction (``denoising'') algorithms
to determine whether they provide advantages in source detection on extragalactic survey images.
The methods under analysis are Perona-Malik filtering, Bilateral filter, Total Variation denoising,
Structure-texture image decomposition, Non-local means, Wavelets, and Block-matching. We tested
the algorithms on simulated images of extragalactic fields with resolution and depth typical of
the Hubble, Spitzer, and Euclid Space Telescopes, and of ground-based instruments. After choosing
their best internal parameters configuration, we assess their performance as a function of resolution,
background level, and image type, also testing their ability to preserve the objects fluxes and
shapes. We analyze in terms of completeness and purity the catalogs extracted after applying denoising
algorithms on a simulated Euclid Wide Survey VIS image, on real H160 (HST) and K-band (HAWK-I) observations
of the CANDELS GOODS-South field. Denoising algorithms often outperform the standard approach
of filtering with the Point Spread Function (PSF) of the image. Applying Structure-Texture image
decomposition, Perona-Malik filtering, the Total Variation method by Chambolle, and Bilateral
filtering on the Euclid-VIS image, we obtain catalogs that are both more pure and complete by 0.2
magnitudes than those based on the standard approach. The same result is achieved with the Structure-Texture
image decomposition algorithm applied on the H160 image. The advantage of denoising techniques
with respect to PSF filtering increases at increasing depth. Moreover, these techniques better
preserve the shape of the detected objects with respect to PSF smoothing. Denoising algorithms
provide significant improvements in the detection of faint objects and enhance the scientific
return of current and future extragalactic surveys.

A rare opportunity to distinguish internal and environmental effects on galaxy evolution is afforded
by "Supergroups", systems which are rich and massive but include several comparably rich substructures,
surrounded by filaments. We present here a multiwavelength photometric and spectroscopic study
of the galaxy population in the Supergroup Abell 1882 at $z$=0.139, combining new data from the MMT
and Hectospec with archival results from the Galaxy And Mass Assembly (GAMA) survey, the Sloan Digital
Sky Survey (SDSS), NED, the Gemini Multi-Object Spectrograph (GMOS) and Galaxy Evolution Explorer
(GALEX). These provide spectroscopic classifications for 526 member galaxies, across wide ranges
of local density and velocity dispersion. We identify three prominent filaments along which galaxies
seem to be entering the Supergroup (mostly in E-W directions). Abell 1882 has a well-populated red
sequence, containing most galaxies with stellar mass $>$ $10^{10.5}$ $M_{sun}$, and a pronounced
color-density relation even within its substructures. Thus, galaxy evolution responds to the
external environment as strongly in these unrelaxed systems as we find in rich and relaxed clusters.
From these data, local density remains the primary factor with a secondary role for distance from
the inferred center of the entire structure's potential well. Effects on star formation, as traced
by optical and near-UV colors, depend on galaxy mass. We see changes in lower-mass galaxies (M $<$
$10^{10.5}$ $M_{sun}$) at four times the virial radius of major substructures, while the more massive
$NUV$ Green Valley galaxies show low levels of star formation within two virial radii. Suppression
of star formation ("quenching") occurs in the infall regions of these structures even before galaxies
enter the denser group environment.

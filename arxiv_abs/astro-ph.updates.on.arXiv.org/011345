Traditional spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting codes used to derive galaxy physical properties
are often uncertain at the factor of a few level owing to uncertainties in galaxy star formation histories
and dust attenuation curves. Beyond this, Bayesian fitting (which is typically used in SED fitting
software) is an intrinsically compute-intensive task, often requiring access to expensive hardware
for long periods of time. To overcome these shortcomings, we have developed {\sc mirkwood}: a user-friendly
tool comprising of an ensemble of supervised machine learning-based models capable of non-linearly
mapping galaxy fluxes to their properties. By stacking multiple models, we marginalize against
any individual model's poor performance in a given region of the parameter space. We demonstrate
\textsc{mirkwood}'s significantly improved performance over traditional techniques by training
it on a combined data set of mock photometry of z=0 galaxies from the \textsc{Simba}, \textsc{EAGLE}
and \textsc{IllustrisTNG} cosmological simulations, and comparing the derived results with
those obtained from traditional SED fitting techniques. \textsc{mirkwood} is also able to account
for uncertainties arising both from intrinsic noise in observations, and from finite training
data and incorrect modeling assumptions. To increase the added value to the observational community,
we use Shapley value explanations (SHAP) to fairly evaluate the relative importance of different
bands to understand why particular predictions were reached. We envisage \textsc{mirkwood} to
be an evolving, open-source framework that will provide highly accurate physical properties from
observations of galaxies as compared to traditional SED fitting.

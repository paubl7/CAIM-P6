We reveal the importance of ongoing in-situ star formation in the Brightest Cluster Galaxy in the
massive cool-core CLASH cluster MACS 1931.8-2635 at z=0.35. Using a multi-wavelength approach,
we assess the stellar and warm ionized medium components, spatially resolved by the VLT-MUSE spectroscopy,
and link them to the molecular gas by incorporating sub-mm ALMA observations. We measure the fluxes
of strong emission lines, allowing us to determine the physical conditions of the warm ionized gas.
The ionized gas flux brightness peak corresponds to the location of the supermassive black hole
and the system shows a diffuse warm ionized gas tail extending 30 kpc in N-E direction. The ionized
and molecular gas are co-spatial and co-moving, with the gaseous component in the tail falling inward,
providing fuel for star formation and accretion-powered nuclear activity. The gas is ionized by
a mix of star formation and other energetic processes which give rise to LINER-like emission, with
active galactic nuclei emission dominant only in the BCG core. We measure a star formation rate of
97 Msun/yr, with its peak at the BCG core. However, star formation accounts for only 50-60% of the
energetics needed to ionize the warm gas. In situ star formation generated by thermally unstable
intracluster medium cooling and/or dry mergers dominate the stellar mass growth at z<0.5 and these
mechanisms account for the build-up of 20% of the mass of the system. Our measurements reveal that
the most central regions of the BCG contain the lowest gas phase oxygen abundance, whereas the tail
exhibits slightly more elevated values. The galaxy is a dispersion dominated system, typical for
massive, elliptical galaxies. The gas and stellar kinematics are decoupled, with the gaseous velocity
fields being more closely related to the bulk motions of the intracluster medium.

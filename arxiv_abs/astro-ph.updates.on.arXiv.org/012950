Since particles obey wave equations, in general one is not free to postulate that particles move
on the geodesics associated with test particles. Rather, for this to be the case one has to be able
to derive such behavior starting from the equations of motion that the particles obey, and to do so
one can employ the eikonal approximation. To see what kind of trajectories might occur we explore
the domain of support of the propagators associated with the wave equations. For a minimally coupled
massless scalar field the domain of support in curved space is shown to not be restricted to the light
cone, while for a conformally coupled massless scalar field the curved space domain is only restricted
to the light cone if it propagates in a conformal to flat background. Consequently, eikonalization
does not in general lead to null geodesics for curved space massless rays even though it does lead
to straight line trajectories in flat spacetime. Equal remarks apply to the massless conformal
invariant Maxwell equations. However, for massive particles one does obtain standard geodesic
behavior this way, since they do not propagate on the light cone to begin with. Thus depending on how
big the curvature actually is, in principle, even if not necessarily in practice, the standard null-geodesic-based
gravitational bending formula and the general behavior of propagating light rays are in need of
modification in regions with high enough curvature. We show that relativistic eikonalization
has an intrinsic light-front structure, and show that eikonalization in a theory with local conformal
symmetry leads to trajectories that are only globally conformally symmetric. Propagation of massless
particles off the light cone is also manifest in a conformal invariant scalar field propagator in
two spacetime dimensions. It takes support both on and inside the light cone, even if the geometry
is conformal to flat.

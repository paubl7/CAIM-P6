We report the discovery and characterization of two transiting planets around the bright M1 V star
LP 961-53 (TOI-776, J = 8.5 mag, M = 0.54+-0.03 Msun) detected during Sector 10 observations of the
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). Combining the TESS photometry with HARPS radial
velocities, as well as ground-based follow-up transit observations from MEarth and LCOGT telescopes,
we measured for the inner planet, TOI-776 b, a period of 8.25 d, a radius of 1.85+-0.13 Re, and a mass
of 4.0+-0.9 Me; and for the outer planet, TOI-776 c, a period of 15.66 d, a radius of 2.02+-0.14 Re,
and a mass of 5.3+-1.8 Me. The Doppler data shows one additional signal, with a period of 34 d, associated
with the rotational period of the star. The analysis of fifteen years of ground-based photometric
monitoring data and the inspection of different spectral line indicators confirm this assumption.
The bulk densities of TOI-776 b and c allow for a wide range of possible interior and atmospheric compositions.
However, both planets have retained a significant atmosphere, with slightly different envelope
mass fractions. Thanks to their location near the radius gap for M dwarfs, we can start to explore
the mechanism(s) responsible for the radius valley emergence around low-mass stars as compared
to solar-like stars. While a larger sample of well-characterized planets in this parameter space
is still needed to draw firm conclusions, we tentatively estimate that the stellar mass below which
thermally-driven mass loss is no longer the main formation pathway for sculpting the radius valley
is between 0.63 and 0.54 Msun. Due to the brightness of the star, the TOI-776 system is also an excellent
target for the James Webb Space Telescope, providing a remarkable laboratory to break the degeneracy
in planetary interior models and to test formation and evolution theories of small planets around
low-mass stars.

Quiescent hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray emission from neutron stars constitute a promising frontier
to explore axion-like-particles (ALPs). ALP production in the core peaks at energies of a few keV
to a few hundreds of keV; subsequently, the ALPs escape and convert to photons in the magnetosphere.
The emissivity goes as $\sim T^6$ while the conversion probability is enhanced for large magnetic
fields, making magnetars, with their high core temperatures and strong magnetic fields, ideal
targets for probing ALPs. We compute the energy spectrum of photons resulting from conversion of
ALPs in the magnetosphere and then compare it against hard X-ray data from NuSTAR, INTEGRAL, and
XMM-Newton, for a set of eight magnetars for which such data exists. Upper limits are placed on the
product of the ALP-nucleon and ALP-photon couplings. For the production in the core, we perform
a calculation of the ALP emissivity in degenerate nuclear matter modeled by a relativistic mean
field theory. The reduction of the emissivity due to improvements to the one-pion exchange approximation
is incorporated, as is the suppression of the emissivity due to proton superfluidity in the neutron
star core. A range of core temperatures is considered, corresponding to different models of the
steady heat transfer from the core to the stellar surface. For the subsequent conversion, we solve
the coupled differential equations mixing ALPs and photons in the magnetosphere. The conversion
occurs due to a competition between the dipolar magnetic field and the photon refractive index induced
by the external magnetic field. Semi-analytic expressions are provided alongside the full numerical
results. We also present an analysis of the uncertainty on the axion limits we derive due to the uncertainties
in the magnetar masses, nuclear matter equation of state, and the proton superfluid critical temperature.

Hot stars are the main source of ionization of the interstellar medium and its enrichment due to heavy
elements. Constraining the physical conditions of their environments is crucial to understand
how these stars evolve and their impact on the evolution of galaxies. The objective of my thesis was
to investigate the physical properties of the photosphere and circumstellar environment of massive
hot stars confronting multi-band spectroscopic or spectro-interferometric observations and
sophisticated non-LTE radiative transfer codes. My work was focused on two main lines of research.
The first concerns radiative line-driven winds. Using UV and visible spectroscopic data and the
radiative transfer code CMFGEN, I investigated the weak wind phenomenon on a sample of nine Galactic
O stars. This study shows for the first time that the weak wind phenomenon, originally found for O
dwarfs, also exists on more evolved O stars and that future studies must evaluate its impact on the
evolution of massive stars. My other line of research concerns the study of classical Be stars, the
fastest rotators among the non-degenerated stars, and which are surrounded by rotating equatorial
disks. I studied the Be star $\omicron$ Aquarii using H$\alpha$ (CHARA/VEGA) and Br$\gamma$ (VLTI/AMBER)
spectro-interferometric observations, the radiative transfer code HDUST, and developing new
automatic procedures to better constrain the kinematics of the disk. This multi-band study allowed
to draw the most detailed picture of this object and its environment, to test the limits of the current
generation of radiative transfer models, and paved the way to my future work on a large samples of
Be stars observed with VEGA, AMBER, and the newly available VLTI mid-infrared combiner MATISSE.

Active galactic nuclei (AGNs) show episodic activity, evident in galaxies that exhibit restarted
radio jets. These restarted jets can interact with their environment, leaving signatures on the
radio spectral energy distribution. Tracing these signatures requires resolved spectral index
measurements over a broad frequency range including low frequencies. We present such a study for
the radio galaxy 3C 293. Using the International LOFAR telescope (ILT) we probed spatial scales
as fine as ~0.2" at 144 MHz, and to constrain the spectrum we combined these data with Multi-Element
Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) and Very Large Array (VLA) archival data. In the inner
lobes (~2 kpc), we detect the presence of a spectral turnover that peaks at ~225 MHz and is most likely
caused by free-free absorption from the rich surrounding medium. We confirm that these inner lobes
are part of a jet-dominated young radio source (spectral age $\lesssim$0.17 Myr), which is strongly
interacting with the rich interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. The outer lobes (~100 kpc)
have a spectral index of $\alpha$~0.6-0.8 from 144-4850 MHz with a remarkably uniform spatial distribution
and only mild spectral curvature ($\Delta\alpha\lesssim$ 0.2). We propose that intermittent
fuelling and jet flow disruptions are powering the mechanisms that keep the spectral index in the
outer lobes from steepening and maintain the spatial uniformity of the spectral index. Overall,
it appears that 3C 293 has gone through multiple (two to three) epochs of activity. This study adds
3C 293 to the new sub-group of restarted galaxies with short interruption time periods. This is the
first time a spatially resolved study simultaneously studies a young source as well as the older
outer lobes at such low frequencies. This illustrates the potential of the ILT to expand such studies
to a larger sample of radio galaxies.

A self-similar spherical collapse model predicts a dark matter (DM) splashback and accretion shock
in the outskirts of galaxy clusters while misses a key ingredient of structure formation - processes
associated with mergers. To fill this gap, we perform simulations of merging self-similar clusters
and investigate their DM and gas evolution in an idealized cosmological context. Our simulations
show that the cluster rapidly contracts during the major merger and the splashback radius $r_{\rm
sp}$ decreases, approaching the virial radius $r_{\rm vir}$. While $r_{\rm sp}$ correlates with
a smooth mass accretion rate (MAR) parameter $\Gamma_{\rm s}$ in the self-similar model, our simulations
show a similar trend with the total MAR $\Gamma_{\rm vir}$ (includes both mergers and $\Gamma_{\rm
s}$). The scatter of the $\Gamma_{\rm vir}-r_{\rm sp}/r_{\rm vir}$ relation indicates a generally
low $\Gamma_{\rm s}\sim1$ in clusters in cosmological simulations. In contrast to the DM, the hot
gaseous atmospheres significantly expand by the merger-accelerated (MA-) shocks formed when
the runaway merger shocks overtake the outer accretion shock. After a major merger, the MA-shock
radius is larger than $r_{\rm sp}$ by a factor of up to $\sim1.7$ for $\Gamma_{\rm s}\lesssim1$ and
is $\sim r_{\rm sp}$ for $\Gamma_{\rm s}\gtrsim3$. This implies that (1) mergers could easily generate
the MA-shock-splashback offset measured in cosmological simulations, and (2) the smooth MAR is
small in regions away from filaments where MA-shocks reside. We further discuss various shocks
and contact discontinuities formed at different epochs of the merger, the ram pressure stripping
in cluster outskirts, and the dependence of member galaxies' splashback feature on their orbital
parameters.

Context. The recent estimates of the 3D shape of the M/Xe-type triple asteroid system (216) Kleopatra
indicated a density of 5 g.cm$^{-3}$. Such a high density implies a high metal content and a low porosity
which is not easy to reconcile with its peculiar dumbbell shape. Aims. Given the unprecedented angular
resolution of the VLT/SPHERE/ZIMPOL camera, we aim to constrain the mass and the shape of Kleopatra
with high accuracy, hence its density. Methods. We combined our new VLT/SPHERE observations of
Kleopatra recorded in 2017 and 2018 with archival data, as well as lightcurve, occultation, and
delay-Doppler images, to derive its 3D shape model using two different algorithms (ADAM, MPCD).
Furthermore, an N-body dynamical model allowed us to retrieve the orbital elements of the two moons
as explained in the accompanying paper. Results. The shape of Kleopatra is very close to an equilibrium
dumbbell figure with two lobes and a thick neck. Its volume equivalent diameter (118.75$\pm$1.40)
km and mass (2.97$\pm$0.32) 10$^{18}$ kg imply a bulk density of (3.38$\pm$0.50) g cm$^{-3}$. Such
a low density for a supposedly metal-rich body indicates a substantial porosity within the primary.
This porous structure along with its near-equilibrium shape is compatible with a formation scenario
including a giant impact followed by reaccumulation. Kleopatra's current rotation period and
dumbbell shape imply that it is in a critically rotating state. The low effective gravity along the
equator of the body, together with the equatorial orbits of the moons and possibly rubble-pile structure,
opens the possibility that the moons formed via mass shedding. Conclusions. Kleopatra is a puzzling
multiple system due to the unique characteristics of the primary. It deserves particular attention
in the future, with the Extremely Large Telescopes and possibly a dedicated space mission.

We study quadratic gravity $R^2+R_{[\mu\nu]}^2$ in the Palatini formalism where the connection
and the metric are independent. This action has a {\it gauged} scale symmetry (also known as Weyl
gauge symmetry) of Weyl gauge field $v_\mu= (\tilde\Gamma_\mu-\Gamma_\mu)/2$, with $\tilde\Gamma_\mu$
($\Gamma_\mu$) the trace of the Palatini (Levi-Civita) connection, respectively. The underlying
geometry is non-metric due to the $R_{[\mu\nu]}^2$ term acting as a gauge kinetic term for $v_\mu$.
We show that this theory has an elegant spontaneous breaking of gauged scale symmetry and mass generation
in the absence of matter, where the necessary scalar field ($\phi$) is not added ad-hoc to this purpose
but is "extracted" from the $R^2$ term. The gauge field becomes massive by absorbing the derivative
term $\partial_\mu\ln\phi$ of the Stueckelberg field ("dilaton"). In the broken phase one finds
the Einstein-Proca action of $v_\mu$ of mass proportional to the Planck scale $M\sim \langle\phi\rangle$,
and a positive cosmological constant. Below this scale $v_\mu$ decouples, the connection becomes
Levi-Civita and metricity and Einstein gravity are recovered. These results remain valid in the
presence of non-minimally coupled scalar field (Higgs-like) with Palatini connection and the
potential is computed. In this case the theory gives successful inflation and a specific prediction
for the tensor-to-scalar ratio $0.007\leq r \leq 0.01$ for current spectral index $n_s$ (at $95\%$CL)
and N=60 efolds. This value of $r$ is mildly larger than in inflation in Weyl quadratic gravity of
similar symmetry, due to different non-metricity. This establishes a connection between non-metricity
and inflation predictions and enables us to test such theories by future CMB experiments.

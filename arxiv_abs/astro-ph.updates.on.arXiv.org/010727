Energy injection by supernovae may drive hot supersonic galactic winds in rapidly star-forming
galaxies, driving metal-enriched gas into the circumgalactic medium and potentially accelerating
cool gas. If sufficiently mass-loaded, such flows become radiative within the wind-driving region,
reducing the overall mass outflow rate from the host galaxy. We show that this sets a maximum on the
total outflow momentum for hot energy-driven winds. For a spherical wind of Solar metallicity driven
by continuous star formation, $\dot p_\rm{max} \simeq 1.9\times10^4\ M_\odot/\rm{yr\ km/s}\
(\alpha/0.9)^{0.86}(R_\star/300\ \rm{pc})^{0.14}(\dot M_\star/20\ M_\odot/\rm{yr})^{0.86}$,
where $\alpha$ is the fraction of supernova energy that thermalizes the wind, and $\dot M_\star$
and $R_\star$ are the star formation rate and radius of the wind-driving region. This maximum momentum
for hot winds can also apply to cool, ionized outflows that are typically observed in starburst galaxies,
if the hot wind undergoes bulk radiative cooling or if the hot wind transfers mass and momentum to
cool clouds within the flow. We show that requiring the hot wind to undergo single-phase cooling
on large scales sets a minimum on the total outflow momentum rate. These maximum and minimum outflow
momenta have similar values, setting a characteristic momentum rate of hot galactic winds that
can become radiative on large scales. We find that most observations of photoionized outflow wind
momentum fall below the theoretical maximum and thus may be signatures of cooling hot flows. On the
other hand, many systems fall below the minimum momentum required for bulk cooling, indicating
that perhaps the cool material observed has instead been entrained in or mixed with the hot flow.

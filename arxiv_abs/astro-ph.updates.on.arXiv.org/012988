We extend the local stellar galaxy-(sub)halo connection to the atomic hydrogen (HI) component
by seeding semi-empirically galaxies into a large N-body dark matter (DM) simulation. The main
input to construct the mock galaxy catalogue are: our constrained stellar mass-to-(sub)halo circular
velocity ($M_{\ast}$-$V_{\rm DM}$) relation, assuming a scatter independent of any galaxy property,
and the empirical $M_{\rm HI}$ conditional probability distributions given $M_{\ast}$ for central
and satellite galaxies. We find that the $\langle\log M_{\rm HI}\rangle-\log M_{\rm DM}$ relation
is not a monotonic increasing function. It increases with mass up to $M_{\rm DM}\sim 10^{12}$ $M_{\odot}$,
attaining a maximum of $\langle\log(M_{\rm HI}/M_{\odot})\rangle \sim 9.2$, and at higher (sub)halo
masses, $\langle\log(M_{\rm HI})\rangle$ decreases slightly with $M_{\rm DM}$. The scatter
around it is also large and mass dependent. The bivariate $M_{\rm HI}$ and $M_{\rm DM}$ distribution
is broad and bimodal, specially at $M_{\rm DM}\gtrsim 10^{12}$ $M_\odot$, which is inherited from
the input $M_{\rm HI}$ conditional distributions. We also report the total (central+satellites)
HI gas mass within halos, $\langle M^{\rm tot}_{\rm HI}(M_{\rm DM})\rangle$, as a function of $M_{\rm
DM}$. The mean $M^{\rm tot}_{\rm HI}-M_{\rm DM}$ relation is an increasing monotonic function.
The galaxy spatial clustering increases weakly as the $M_{\rm HI}$ threshold increases. Our HI
mock galaxies cluster more in comparison to the blind HI ALFALFA (Arecibo Fast Legacy ALFA) survey
but we show that it is mainly due to the selection effects. We discuss the implications of our results
in the light of predictions from semi-analytical models and hydrodynamics simulations of galaxy
evolution.

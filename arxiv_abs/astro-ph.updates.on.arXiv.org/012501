Transit surveys have revealed a significant population of compact multi-planet systems, containing
several sub-Neptune-mass planets on close-in, tightly-packed orbits. These systems are thought
to have formed through a final phase of giant impacts, which would tend to leave systems close to the
edge of stability. Here, we assess this hypothesis, comparing observed eccentricities in systems
exhibiting transit-timing variations (TTVs), with the maximum eccentricities compatible with
long-term stability. We use the machine-learning classifier SPOCK (Tamayo et al. 2020) to rapidly
classify the stability of numerous initial configurations and hence determine these stability
limits. While previous studies have argued that multi-planet systems are often maximally packed,
in the sense that they could not host any additional planets, we find that the existing planets in
these systems have measured eccentricities below the limits allowed by stability by a factor of
2--10. We compare these results against predictions from the giant impact theory of planet formation,
derived from both $N$-body integrations and theoretical expectations that in the absence of dissipation,
the orbits of such planets should be distributed uniformly throughout the phase space volume allowed
by stability. We find that the observed systems have systematically lower eccentricities than
this scenario predicts, with a median eccentricity about 4 times lower than predicted. These findings
suggest that if such systems formed through giant impacts, then some dissipation must occur to damp
their eccentricities. This may take place during formation, perhaps through interactions with
the natal gas disk or a leftover population of planetesimals, or over longer timescales through
the coupling of tidal and secular processes.

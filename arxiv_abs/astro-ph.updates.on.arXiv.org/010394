Most of the variability studies of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are based on ensemble analyses.
Nevertheless, it is interesting to provide estimates of the individual variability properties
of each AGN, in order to relate them with intrinsic physical quantities. A useful dataset is provided
by the Catalina Surveys Data Release 2 (CSDR2), which encompasses almost a decade of photometric
measurements of $\sim500$ million objects repeatedly observed hundreds of times. We aim to investigate
the individual optical variability properties of 795 AGNs originally included in the Multi-Epoch
XMM Serendipitous AGN Sample 2 (MEXSAS2). Our goals consist in: (i) searching for correlations
between variability and AGN physical quantities; (ii) extending our knowledge of the variability
features of MEXSAS2 from the X-ray to the optical. We use the structure function (SF) to analyse AGN
flux variations. We model the SF as a power-law, $\text{SF}(\tau)=A\,(\tau/\tau_0)^\gamma$,
and we compute its variability parameters. We introduce the V-correction as a simple tool to correctly
quantify the amount of variability in the rest frame of each source. We find a significant decrease
of variability amplitude with increasing bolometric, optical and X-ray luminosity. We obtain
the indication of an intrinsically weak positive correlation between variability amplitude and
redshift, $z$. Variability amplitude is also positively correlated with $\alpha_\text{ox}$.
The slope of the SF, $\gamma$, is weakly correlated with the bolometric luminosity $L_\text{bol}$
and/or with the black hole mass $M_\text{BH}$. When comparing optical to X-ray variability properties,
we find that X-ray variability amplitude is approximately the same for those AGNs with larger or
smaller variability amplitude in the optical. On the contrary, AGNs with steeper SF in the optical
do present steeper SF in the X-ray, and vice versa.

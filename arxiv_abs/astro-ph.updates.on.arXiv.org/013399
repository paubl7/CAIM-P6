We present deep Chandra X-ray observations of two nearby Type Ia supernovae, SN 2017cbv and SN 2020nlb,
which reveal no X-ray emission down to a luminosity $L_X$$\lesssim$5.3$\times$10$^{37}$ and
$\lesssim$5.4$\times$10$^{37}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (0.3--10 keV), respectively, at $\sim$16--18
days after the explosion. With these limits, we constrain the pre-explosion mass-loss rate of the
progenitor system to be $\dot{M}$$<$7.2$\times$10$^{-9}$ and $<$9.7$\times$10$^{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$ for each (at a wind velocity $v_w$=100 km s$^{-1}$ and a radius of $R$$\approx$10$^{16}$
cm), assuming any X-ray emission would originate from inverse Compton emission from optical photons
up-scattered by the supernova shock. If the supernova environment was a constant density medium,
we find a number density limit of n$_{CSM}$$<$36 and $<$65 cm$^{-3}$, respectively. These X-ray
limits rule out all plausible symbiotic progenitor systems, as well as large swathes of parameter
space associated with the single degenerate scenario, such as mass loss at the outer Lagrange point
and accretion winds. We also present late-time optical spectroscopy of SN 2020nlb, and set strong
limits on any swept up hydrogen ($L_{H\alpha}$$<$2.7$\times$10$^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) and helium
($L_{He, \lambda 6678}$$<$2.7$\times$10$^{37}$ ergs s$^{-1}$) from a nondegenerate companion,
corresponding to $M_{H}$$\lesssim$0.7--2$\times$10$^{-3}$ M$_{\odot}$ and $M_{He}$$\lesssim$4$\times$10$^{-3}$
M$_{\odot}$. Radio observations of SN 2020nlb at 14.6 days after explosion also yield a non-detection,
ruling out most plausible symbiotic progenitor systems. While we have doubled the sample of normal
type Ia supernovae with deep X-ray limits, more observations are needed to sample the full range
of luminosities and sub-types of these explosions, and set statistical constraints on their circumbinary
environments.

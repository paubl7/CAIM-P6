We study the possible occurrence of the hadron-quark phase transition (PT) during the merging of
neutron star binaries by hydrodynamical simulations employing a set of temperature dependent
hybrid equations of state (EoSs). Following previous work we describe an unambiguous and measurable
signature of deconfined quark matter in the gravitational-wave (GW) signal of neutron star binary
mergers including equal-mass and unequal-mass systems of different total binary mass. The softening
of the EoS by the PT at higher densities, i.e. after merging, leads to a characteristic increase of
the dominant postmerger GW frequency f_peak relative to the tidal deformability Lambda inferred
during the premerger inspiral phase. Hence, measuring such an increase of the postmerger frequency
provides evidence for the presence of a strong PT. If the postmerger frequency and the tidal deformability
are compatible with results from purely baryonic EoS models yielding very tight relations between
f_peak and Lambda, a strong PT can be excluded up to a certain density. We find tight correlations
of f_peak and Lambda with the maximum density during the early postmerger remnant evolution. These
GW observables thus inform about the density regime which is probed by the remnant and its GW emission.
Exploiting such relations we devise a directly applicable, concrete procedure to constrain the
onset density of the QCD PT from future GW measurements. We point out two interesting scenarios:
if no indications for a PT are inferred from a GW detection, our procedure yields a lower limit on the
onset density of the hadron quark PT. On the contrary, if a merger event reveals evidence for the occurrence
of deconfined quark matter, the inferred GW parameters set an upper limit on the PT onset density.

We developed a parametric Galactic model toward the Galactic bulge by fitting to spatial distributions
of the Gaia DR2 disk velocity, VVV proper motion, BRAVA radial velocity, OGLE-III red clump star
count, and OGLE-IV star count and microlens rate, optimized for use in microlensing studies. We
include the asymmetric drift of Galactic disk stars and the dependence of velocity dispersion on
Galactic location in kinematic model, which has been ignored in most previous models used for microlensing
studies. We show that our model predicts a microlensing parameter distribution that is significantly
different from the one with a typically used model in the previous studies. Through our modeling,
we estimate various fundamental model parameters for our Galaxy, including the initial mass function
(IMF) in the inner Galaxy. Combined constraints from star counts and the microlensing event timescale
distribution from the OGLE-IV survey, in addition to a prior on the bulge stellar mass, enable us
to successfully measure IMF slopes using a broken power law form over a broad mass range, $\alpha_{\rm
bd} = 0.22^{+0.20}_{-0.55}$ for $M < 0.08 \, M_{\odot}$, $\alpha_{\rm ms} = 1.16^{+0.08}_{-0.15}$
for $0.08 \, M_{\odot} \leq M < M_{\rm br}$, and $\alpha_{\rm hm} = 2.32^{+0.14}_{-0.10}$ for $M
\geq M_{\rm br}$, as well as a break mass at $M_{\rm br} = 0.90^{+0.05}_{-0.14} \, M_{\odot}$. This
is significantly different from the Kroupa IMF for local stars, but similar to the Zoccali IMF measured
from a bulge luminosity function. We also estimate the dark matter mass fraction in the bulge region
of $28 \pm 7$\% which could be larger than a previous estimate. Because our model is purely parametric,
it can be universally applied using the parameters provided in this paper.

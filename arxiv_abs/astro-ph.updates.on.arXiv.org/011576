Motivated by the development of high-dispersion spectrographs in the mid-infrared (MIR) range,
we study their application to the atmospheric characterization of nearby non-transiting temperate
terrestrial planets around M-type stars. We examine the detectability of CO$_2$, H$_2$O, N$_2$O,
and O$_3$ in high-resolution planetary thermal emission spectra at 12-18 $\mu $m assuming an Earth-like
profile and a simplified thermal structure. The molecular line width of such planets can be comparable
to or broader than the Doppler shift due to the planetary orbital motion. Given the likely difficulty
in knowing the high-resolution MIR spectrum of the host star with sufficient accuracy, we propose
to observe the target system at two quadrature phases and extract the differential spectra as the
planetary signal. In this case, the signals can be substantially suppressed compared with the case
where the host star spectrum is perfectly known, as some parts of the spectral features do not remain
in the differential spectra. Despite this self-subtraction, the CO$_2$ and H$_2$O features of
nearby ($\lesssim $ 5~pc) systems with mid-/late-M host stars would be practical with a 6.5-meter-class
cryogenic telescope, and orbital inclination could also be constrained for some of them. For CO$_2$
and N$_2$O in a 1~bar Earth-like atmosphere, this method would be sensitive when the mixing ratio
is 1-10$^3$ ppm. The detectability of molecules except O$_3$ is not significantly improved when
the spectral resolution is higher than $\mathcal{R}\gtrsim 10,000$, although the constraint
on the orbital inclination is improved. This study provides some benchmark cases useful for assessing
the value of MIR high-resolution spectroscopy in terms of characterization of potentially habitable
planets.

Context. The properties of the population of Galactic supernova remnants (SNRs) are essential
to our understanding of the dynamics of the interstellar medium (ISM) in the Milky Way. However,
the completeness of the catalog of Galactic SNRs is expected to be only ${\sim}30\%$, with on order
700 SNRs yet to be detected. Deep interferometric radio continuum surveys of the Galactic plane
help in rectifying this apparent deficiency by identifying low surface brightness SNRs and compact
SNRs that have not been detected in previous surveys. However, SNRs are routinely confused with
H II regions, which can have similar radio morphologies. Radio spectral index, polarization, and
emission at mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths can help distinguish between SNRs and H II regions.
Aims. We aim to identify SNR candidates using continuum images from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array GLObal view of the STAR formation in the Milky Way (GLOSTAR) survey. Methods. GLOSTAR is a C-band
(4--8 GHz) radio wavelength survey of the Galactic plane covering $358^{\circ} \leq l \leq 60^{\circ},
|b| \leq 1^{\circ}$. The continuum images from this survey, which resulted from observations with
the most compact configuration of the array, have an angular resolution of $18''$. We searched for
SNRs in these images to identify known SNRs, previously identified SNR candidates, and new SNR candidates.
We study these objects in MIR surveys and the GLOSTAR polarization data to classify their emission
as thermal or nonthermal. Results. We identify 157 SNR candidates, of which 80 are new. Polarization
measurements provide evidence of nonthermal emission from 9 of these candidates. We find that two
previously identified candidates are filaments. We also detect emission from 91 of the 94 known
SNRs in the survey region. Four of these are reclassified as H II regions following detection in MIR
surveys. (Abridged)

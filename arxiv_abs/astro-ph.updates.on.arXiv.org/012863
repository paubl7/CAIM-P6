Sub/millimiter observations of dusty star-forming galaxies with ALMA have shown that the dust
continuum emission occurs generally in compact regions smaller than the stellar distribution.
However, it remains to be understood how systematic these findings are, as they often lack of homogeneity
in the sample selection, target discontinuous areas with inhomogeneous sensitivities, and suffer
from modest $uv$-coverage coming from single array configurations. GOODS-ALMA is a 1.1 mm galaxy
survey over a continuous area of 72.42 arcmin$^2$ at a homogeneous sensitivity. In this version
2.0, we present a new low-resolution dataset and its combination with the previous high-resolution
dataset from Franco et al. (2018), improving the $uv$-coverage and sensitivity reaching an average
of $\sigma = 68.4$ $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$. A total of 88 galaxies are detected in a blind search (compared
to 35 in the high-resolution dataset alone), 50% at $\rm{S/N_{peak}} \geq 5$ and 50% at $3.5 \leq
\rm{S/N_{peak}} \leq 5$ aided by priors. Among them, 13/88 are optically dark/faint sources ($H$
or $K$-band dropouts). The sample dust continuum sizes at 1.1 mm are generally compact, with a median
effective radius of $R_{\rm{e}} = 0"10 \pm 0"05$ (physical size of $R_{\rm{e}} = 0.73 \pm 0.29$ kpc,
at the redshift of each source). Dust continuum sizes evolve with redshift and stellar mass resembling
the trends of the stellar sizes measured at optical wavelengths, albeit a lower normalization compared
to those of late-type galaxies. We conclude that for sources with flux densities $S_{\rm{1.1mm}}
> 1$ mJy compact dust continuum emission at 1.1 mm prevails, and sizes as extended as typical star-forming
stellar disks are rare. $S_{\rm{1.1mm}} < 1$ mJy sources appear slightly more extended at 1.1 mm,
although still generally compact below the sizes of typical star-forming stellar disks.

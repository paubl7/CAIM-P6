Reflections from objects in Earth orbit can produce sub-second, star-like optical flashes similar
to astrophysical transients. Reflections have historically caused false alarms for transient
surveys, but the population has not been systematically studied. We report event rates for these
orbital flashes using the Evryscope Fast Transient Engine, a low-latency transient detection
pipeline for the Evryscopes. We select single-epoch detections likely caused by Earth satellites
and model the event rate as a function of both magnitude and sky position. We measure a rate of $1800^{+600}_{-280}$
sky$^{-1}$ hour$^{-1}$, peaking at $m_g = 13.0$, for flashes morphologically degenerate with
real astrophysical signals in surveys like the Evryscopes. Of these, $340^{+150}_{-85}$ sky$^{-1}$
hour$^{-1}$ are bright enough to be visible to the naked eye in typical suburban skies with a visual
limiting magnitude of $V\approx4$. These measurements place the event rate of orbital flashes
orders of magnitude higher than the combined rate of public alerts from all active all-sky fast-timescale
transient searches, including neutrino, gravitational-wave, gamma-ray, and radio observatories.
Short-timescale orbital flashes form a dominating foreground for un-triggered searches for fast
transients in low-resolution, wide-angle surveys. However, events like fast radio bursts (FRBs)
with arcminute-scale localization have a low probability ($\sim10^{-5}$) of coincidence with
an orbital flash, allowing optical surveys to place constraints on their potential optical counterparts
in single images. Upcoming satellite internet constellations, like SpaceX Starlink, are unlikely
to contribute significantly to the population of orbital flashes in normal operations.

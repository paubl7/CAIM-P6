We present new measurements of the spatial distribution and kinematics of neutral hydrogen in the
circumgalactic and intergalactic medium surrounding star-forming galaxies at z ~ 2. Using the
spectra of ~ 3000 galaxies with redshifts <z> +/- 0.4 from the Keck Baryonic Structure Survey (KBSS),
we assemble a sample of more than 200,000 distinct foreground-background pairs with projected
angular separations of 3 - 500 arcsec and spectroscopic redshifts, with <$z_{fg}$> = 2.23 and <$z_{bg}$>
= 2.57. The ensemble of sightlines and foreground galaxies is used to construct a 2D map of the mean
excess Ly$\alpha$ optical depth relative to the intergalactic mean as a function of projected galactocentric
distance (20 < $D_{tran}$/pkpc < 4000) and line-of-sight velocity. We provide information on the
line-of-sight kinematics of H I gas as a function of projected distance $D_{tran}$. We compare the
map with cosmological zoom-in simulation, finding qualitative agreement between them. A simple
two-component (accretion, outflow) analytical model generally reproduces the observed line-of-sight
kinematics and projected spatial distribution of H I. The best-fitting model suggests that galaxy-scale
outflows with initial velocity $v_{out}$ ~ 600 km/s dominate the kinematics of circumgalactic
H I out to $D_{tran}$ ~ 50 kpc, while H I at $D_{tran}$ > 100 kpc is dominated by infall with characteristic
$v_{in}$ < $v_c$, where $v_c$ is the circular velocity of the host halo ($M_h$ ~ $10^{12} M_\odot$).
Over the impact parameter range 80 < $D_{tran}$/pkpc < 200, the H I line-of-sight velocity range
reaches a minimum, with a corresponding flattening in the rest-frame Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width.
These observations can be naturally explained as the transition between outflow-dominated and
accretion-dominated flows. Beyond $D_{tran}$ ~ 300 kpc, the line of sight kinematics are dominated
by Hubble expansion.

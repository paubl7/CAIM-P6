In this work we study how to employ the upcoming Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) data to constrain
physical properties of normal, star forming galaxies. We use simulated LSST data and existing real
observations to test the estimations of the physical properties of galaxies, such as star formation
rate (SFR), stellar mass ($M_{star}$), and dust luminosity ($L_{dust}$). We focus on normal star-forming
galaxies, as they form the majority of the galaxy population in the universe and therefore are more
likely to be observed by the LSST. We perform a simulation of LSST observations and uncertainties
of 50,385 real galaxies within redshift range $0<z<2.5$. In order to achieve this goal, we used the
unique multi-wavelength data from the Herschel Extragalactic Legacy Project (HELP) survey. Our
analysis focus on two fields: ELAIS-N1 and COSMOS. To obtain galaxy physical properties we fit their
Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) using the Code Investigating GALaxy Emission (CIGALE).
We compare the main galaxy physical properties obtained from the fit of the observed multi-wavelength
photometry of galaxies (from UV to FIR) to the ones obtained from the simulated LSST optical measurements
only. The stellar masses estimated based on the LSST measurements are in agreement with the full
UV-FIR SED estimations, as they depend mainly on the UV and optical emission, well covered by LSST
in the considered redshift range. We obtain a clear overestimation of SFR, $L_{dust}$, $M_{dust}$
estimated with LSST only, highly correlated with redshift. We investigate the cause of this overestimation
and we conclude that it is related to an overestimation of the dust attenuation, both UV and NIR. We
find that it is necessary to employ auxiliary rest-frame mid-infrared observations, simulated
UV observations, or FUV attenuation (AFUV)- Mstar relation, to correct the overestimation.

Recently, it has been shown that rocky planets orbiting neutron stars can be habitable under non
unrealistic circumstances. If a distant, pointlike source of visible light such as a Sun-like main
sequence star or the gravitationally lensed accretion disk of a supermassive black hole is present
as well, possible temporal variations $\Delta\varepsilon_\mathrm{p}(t)$ of the planet's axial
tilt $\varepsilon_\mathrm{p}$ to the ecliptic plane should be included in the overall habitability
budget since the obliquity determines the insolation at a given latitude on a body' s surface. I point
out that, for rather generic initial spin-orbit initial configurations, general relativistic
and classical spin variations induced by the post-Newtonian de Sitter and Lense-Thirring components
of the field of the host neutron star and by its pull to the planetary oblateness $J_2^\mathrm{p}$
may induce huge and very fast variations of $\varepsilon_\mathrm{p}$ which would likely have an
impact on the habitability of such worlds. In particular, for a planet's distance of, say, $0.005\,\mathrm{au}$
from a $1.4\,M_\odot$ neutron star corresponding to an orbital period $P_\mathrm{b}=0.109\,\mathrm{d}$,
obliquity shifts $\Delta\varepsilon_\mathrm{p}$ as large as $\varepsilon^\mathrm{max}_\mathrm{p}-\varepsilon_\mathrm{p}^\mathrm{min}\simeq
50^\circ-100^\circ$ over characteristic timescales as short as $10\,\mathrm{d}$ ($J_2^\mathrm{p}$)
to $3\,\mathrm{Myr}$ (Lense-Thirring) may occur for arbitrary orientations of the orbital and
spin angular momenta $\boldsymbol{L},\,{\boldsymbol{S}}_\mathrm{ns},\,{\boldsymbol{S}}_\mathrm{p}$
of the planet-neutron star system. In view of this feature of their spins, I dub such hypothetical
planets as ``nethotrons".

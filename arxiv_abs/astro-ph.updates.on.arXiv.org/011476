We investigate the effect of strong emission line galaxies on the performance of empirical photometric
redshift estimation methods. In order to artificially control the contribution of photometric
error and emission lines to total flux, we develop a PCA-based stochastic mock catalogue generation
technique that allows for generating infinite signal-to-noise ratio model spectra with realistic
emission lines on top of theoretical stellar continua. Instead of running the computationally
expensive stellar population synthesis and nebular emission codes, our algorithm generates realistic
spectra with a statistical approach, and - as an alternative to attempting to constrain the priors
on input model parameters - works by matching output observational parameters. Hence, it can be
used to match the luminosity, colour, emission line and photometric error distribution of any photometric
sample with sufficient flux-calibrated spectroscopic follow-up. We test three simple empirical
photometric estimation methods and compare the results with and without photometric noise and
strong emission lines. While photometric noise clearly dominates the uncertainty of photometric
redshift estimates, the key findings are that emission lines play a significant role in resolving
colour space degeneracies and good spectroscopic coverage of the entire colour space is necessary
to achieve good results with empirical photo-z methods. Template fitting methods, on the other
hand, must use a template set with sufficient variation in emission line strengths and ratios, or
even better, first estimate the redshift empirically and fit the colours with templates at the best-fit
redshift to calculate the K-correction and various physical parameters.

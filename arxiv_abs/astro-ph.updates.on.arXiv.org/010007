As part of the search for planets around evolved stars, we can understand planet populations around
significantly higher-mass stars than the Sun on the main sequence. This population is difficult
to study any other way, particularly with radial-velocities since these stars are too hot and rotate
too fast to measure precise velocities. Here we estimate stellar parameters for all of the giant
stars from the EXPRESS project, which aims to detect planets orbiting evolved stars, and study their
occurrence rate as a function of stellar mass. We analyse high resolution echelle spectra of these
stars, and compute the atmospheric parameters by measuring the equivalent widths for a set of iron
lines, using an updated method implemented during this work. Physical parameters are computed
by interpolating through a grid of stellar evolutionary models, following a procedure that carefully
takes into account the post-MS evolutionary phases. Probabilities of the star being in the red giant
branch (RBG) or the horizontal branch (HB) are estimated from the derived distributions. Results:
We find that, out of 166 evolved stars, 101 of them are most likely in the RGB phase, while 65 of them
are in the HB phase. The mean derived mass is 1.41 and 1.87 Msun for RGB and HB stars, respectively.
To validate our method, we compared our results with interferometry and asteroseismology studies.
We find a difference in the radius with interferometry of 1.7%. With asteroseismology, we find 2.4%
difference in logg, 1.5% in radius, 6.2% in mass, and 11.9% in age. Compared with previous spectroscopic
studies, and find a 0.5% difference in Teff, 1% in logg, and 2% in [Fe/H]. We also find a mean mass difference
with respect to the EXPRESS original catalogue of 16%. We show that the method presented here can
greatly improve the estimates of the stellar parameters for giant stars compared to what was presented
previously.

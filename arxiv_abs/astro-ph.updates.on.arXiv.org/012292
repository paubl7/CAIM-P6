The first appearance of radio type II burst emission at decameter-hectometer (DH) waves typically
occurs in connection, and often simultaneously, with other types of radio emissions. As type II
bursts are signatures of propagating shock waves that are associated with flares and coronal mass
ejections (CMEs), a rich variety of radio emissions can be expected. However, sometimes DH type
II bursts appear in the dynamic spectra without other or earlier radio signatures. One explanation
for them could be that the flare-CME launch happens on the far side of the Sun, and the emission is observed
only when the source gets high enough in the solar atmosphere. In this study we have analysed 26 radio
type II bursts that started at DH waves and were well-separated ('isolated') from other radio emission
features. These bursts were identified from all DH type II bursts observed in 1998-2016, and for
12 events we had observations from at least two different viewing angles with the instruments onboard
Wind and STEREO satellites. We found that only 30% of the type II bursts had their source origin on
the far side of the Sun, but also that no bursts originated from the central region of the Sun (longitudes
E30 - W40). Almost all of the isolated DH type II bursts could be associated with a shock near the CME
leading front, and only few were determined to be shocks near the CME flank regions. In this respect
our result differs from earlier findings. Our analysis, which included inspection of various CME
and radio emission characteristics, suggests that the isolated DH type II bursts could be a special
subgroup within DH type II bursts, where the radio emission requires particular coronal conditions
to form and to die out.

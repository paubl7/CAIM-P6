Large surveys using modern telescopes are producing images that are increasing exponentially
in size and quality. Identifying objects in the generated images by visual recognition is time-consuming
and labor-intensive, while classifying the extracted radio sources is even more challenging.
To address these challenges, we develop a deep learning-based radio source detector, named \textsc{HeTu},
which is capable of rapidly identifying and classifying radio sources in an automated manner for
both compact and extended radio sources. \textsc{HeTu} is based on a combination of a residual network
(ResNet) and feature pyramid network (FPN). We classify radio sources into four classes based on
their morphology. The training images are manually labeled and data augmentation methods are applied
to solve the data imbalance between the different classes. \textsc{HeTu} automatically locates
the radio sources in the images and assigns them to one of the four classes. The experiment on the testing
dataset shows an average operation time of 5.4 millisecond per image and a precision of 99.4\% for
compact point-like sources and 98.1\% for double-lobe sources. We applied \textsc{HeTu} to the
images obtained from the GaLactic and the Galactic Extragalactic All-Object Murchison Wide-field
Array (GLEAM) survey project. More than 96.9\% of the \textsc{HeTu}-detected compact sources
are matched compared to the source finding software used in the GLEAM. We also detected and classified
2,298 extended sources (including Fanaroff-Riley type I and II sources, and core-jet sources)
above $5\sigma$. The cross-matching rates of extended sources are higher than 97\%, showing excellent
performance of \textsc{HeTu} in identifying extended radio sources. \textsc{HeTu} provides
an efficient tool for radio source finding and classification and can be applied to other scientific
fields.

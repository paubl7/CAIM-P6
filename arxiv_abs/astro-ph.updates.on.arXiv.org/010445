Binary supermassive black holes (BSBHs) are expected to be a generic byproduct from hierarchical
galaxy formation. The final coalescence of BSBHs is thought to be the loudest gravitational wave
(GW) siren, yet no confirmed BSBH is known in the GW-dominated regime. While periodic quasars have
been proposed as BSBH candidates, the physical origin of the periodicity has been largely uncertain.
Here we report discovery of a periodicity (P=1607$\pm$7 days) at 99.95% significance (with a global
p-value of ~$10^{-3}$ accounting for the look elsewhere effect) in the optical light curves of a
redshift 1.53 quasar, SDSS J025214.67-002813.7. Combining archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey
data with new, sensitive imaging from the Dark Energy Survey, the total ~20-yr time baseline spans
~4.6 cycles of the observed 4.4-yr (restframe 1.7-yr) periodicity. The light curves are best fit
by a bursty model predicted by hydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary accretion disks. The periodicity
is likely caused by accretion rate modulation by a milli-parsec BSBH emitting GWs, dynamically
coupled to the circumbinary accretion disk. A bursty hydrodynamic variability model is statistically
preferred over a smooth, sinusoidal model expected from relativistic Doppler boost, a kinematic
effect proposed for PG1302-102. Furthermore, the frequency dependence of the variability amplitudes
disfavors Doppler boost, lending independent support to the circumbinary accretion variability
hypothesis. Given our detection rate of one BSBH candidate from circumbinary accretion variability
out of 625 quasars, it suggests that future large, sensitive synoptic surveys such as the Vera C.
Rubin Observatory Legacy Survey of Space and Time may be able to detect hundreds to thousands of candidate
BSBHs from circumbinary accretion with direct implications for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

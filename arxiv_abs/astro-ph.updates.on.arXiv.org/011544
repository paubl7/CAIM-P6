Brightest cluster galaxies (BCGs) have grown by accreting numerous smaller galaxies and can be
used as tracers of cluster formation and evolution in the cosmic web. However, there is still a controversy
on the main epoch of formation of BCGs, since some authors believe they have already formed before
redshift z=2, while others still find them to evolve at more recent epochs. We aim to analyse the physical
properties of a large sample of BCGs covering a wide redshift range up to z=1.8 and analysed in a homogeneous
way, to see if their characteristics vary with redshift. As a first step, we also present a new tool
to define for each cluster which galaxy is the BCG. For a sample of 137 clusters with HST images in the
optical and/or infrared, we analyse the BCG properties by applying GALFIT with one or two Sersic
components. For each BCG, we compute the Sersic index, effective radius, major axis position angle,
surface brightness. We then search for correlations of these quantities with redshift. We find
that BCGs follow the Kormendy relation (between the effective radius and the mean surface brightness),
with a slope that remains constant with redshift, but with a variation with redshift of the ordinate
at the origin. Although the trends are faint, we find that both the absolute magnitudes and effective
radii tend to become respectively brighter and bigger with decreasing redshift. On the other hand,
we find no significant correlation of the mean surface brightnesses or Sersic indices with redshift.
The major axes of the cluster elongations and of the BCGs agree within 30 degrees for 73% of our clusters
at redshift z <= 0.9. Our results agree with the BCGs being mainly formed before redshift z=2. The
alignment of the major axes of BCGs with their clusters agree with the general idea that BCGs form
at the same time as clusters by accreting matter along the filaments of the cosmic web.

As part of the Portuguese Space Surveillance and Tracking (SST) System, two new Wide Field of View
(2.3deg x 2.3deg) small aperture (30cm) telescopes will be deployed in 2021, at the Pampilhosa da
Serra Space Observatory (PASO), located in the center of the continental Portuguese territory,
in the heart of a certified Dark Sky area. These optical systems will provide added value capabilities
to the Portuguese SST network, complementing the optical telescopes currently in commissioning
in Madeira and Azores. These telescopes are optimized for GEO and MEO survey operations and besides
the required SST operational capability, they will also provide an important development component
to the Portuguese SST network. The telescopes will be equipped with filter wheels, being able to
perform observations in several optical bands including white light, BVRI bands and narrow band
filters such as H(alpha) and O[III] to study potential different objects' albedos. This configuration
enables us to conduct a study on space debris classification$/$characterization using combinations
of different colors aiming the production of improved color index schemes to be incorporated in
the automatic pipelines for classification of space debris. This optical sensor will also be used
to conduct studies on image processing algorithms, including source extraction and classification
solutions through the application of machine learning techniques. Since SST dedicated telescopes
produce a large quantity of data per observation night, fast, efficient and automatic image processing
techniques are mandatory. A platform like this one, dedicated to the development of Space Surveillance
studies, will add a critical capability to keep the Portuguese SST network updated, and as a consequence
it may provide useful developments to the European SST network as well.

Assessing the probability that two or more gravitational wave (GW) events are lensed images of the
same source requires an understanding of the properties of the lensed images. For short enough wavelengths
where wave effects can be neglected, lensed images will generically have a fixed relative phase
shift that needs to be taken into account in the lensing hypothesis. For non-precessing, circular
binaries dominated by quadrupole radiation these lensing phase shifts are degenerate with either
a shift in the coalescence phase or a detector and inclination dependent shift in the orientation
angle. This degeneracy is broken by the presence of higher harmonic modes with $|m|\ne 2$ in the former
and $|m| \ne l$ in the latter. The presence of precession or eccentricity will also break this degeneracy.
This implies that a lensed GW image will not necessarily be consistent with (unlensed) predictions
from general relativity (GR). Therefore, unlike the conventional scenario of electromagnetic
waves, strong lensing of GWs can lead to images with a modified phase evolution that can be observed.
However, we find that templates with a shifted orientation angle remain a good approximation, with
signal-to-noise ratio differences of less than $1\%$ for mass ratios up to 1/18, and less than $5\%$
for precession parameters up to 0.5 and eccentricities up to 0.4. We conclude that an optimal strong
lensing search strategy would incorporate phase information in all stages of the identification
of strong-lensing, with an exact treatment in the final assessment of the probability of multiple
lensed events. This work clarifies the role that strong lensing plays in the phase evolution of GWs:
how it can lead to apparent deviations from GR, how it can affect the detectability of GW events, and
how it can be exploited to help identify cases of strong gravitational lensing of gravitational
wave sources.

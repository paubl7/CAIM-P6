Detailed elemental-abundance patterns of giant stars in the Galactic halo measured by APOGEE-2
have revealed the existence of a unique and significant stellar sub-population of silicon-enhanced
([Si/Fe]$\gtrsim +0.5$) metal-poor stars, spanning a wide range of metallicities ($-1.5\lesssim$[Fe/H]$\lesssim-0.8$).
Stars with over-abundances in [Si/Fe] are of great interest because these have very strong silicon
($^{28}$Si) spectral features for stars of their metallicity and evolutionary stage, offering
clues about rare nucleosynthetic pathways in globular clusters (GCs). Si-rich field stars have
been conjectured to have been evaporated from GCs, however, the origin of their abundances remains
unclear, and several scenarios have been offered to explain the anomalous abundance ratios. These
include the hypothesis that some of them were born from a cloud of gas previously polluted by a progenitor
that underwent a specific and peculiar nucleosynthesis event, or due to mass transfer from a previous
evolved companion. However, those scenarios do not simultaneously explain the wide gamut of chemical
species that are found in Si-rich stars. Instead, we show that the present inventory of such unusual
stars, as well as their relation to known halo substructures (including the in-situ halo, \textit{Gaia}-Enceladus,
the Helmi Stream(s), and Sequoia, among others), is still incomplete. We report the chemical abundances
of the iron-peak (Fe), the light- (C and N), the $\alpha-$ (O and Mg), the odd-Z (Na and Al), and the
\textit{s}-process (Ce and Nd) elements of 55 newly identified Si-rich field stars (among more
than $\sim$600,000 APOGEE-2 targets), that exhibit over-abundance of [Si/Fe] as extreme as those
observed in some Galactic GCs, and are relatively cleanly from other stars in the [Si/Fe]-[Fe/H]
plane. This new census confirms the presence of a statistically significant ...

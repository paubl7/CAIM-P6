One of the primary science goals of the Large UV/Optical/Infrared Surveyor (LUVOIR) mission concept
is to detect and characterize Earth-like exoplanets orbiting nearby stars with direct imaging.
The success of its coronagraph instrument ECLIPS (Extreme Coronagraph for Living Planetary Systems)
depends on the ability to stabilize the wavefront from a large segmented mirror such that optical
path differences are limited to tens of picometers RMS during an exposure time of a few hours. In order
to relax the constraints on the mechanical stability, ECLIPS will be equipped with a wavefront sensing
and control (WS&C) architecture to correct wavefront errors up to temporal frequencies >~1 Hz.
These errors may be dominated by spacecraft structural dynamics exciting vibrations at the segmented
primary mirror. In this work, we present detailed simulations of the WS&C system within the ECLIPS
instrument and the resulting contrast performance. This study assumes wavefront aberrations
based on a finite element model of a simulated telescope with spacecraft structural dynamics. Wavefront
residuals are then computed according to a model of the adaptive optics system that includes numerical
propagation to simulate a realistic wavefront sensor and an analytical model of the temporal performance.
An end-to-end numerical propagation model of ECLIPS is then used to estimate the residual starlight
intensity distribution at the science detector. We show that the contrast performance depends
strongly on the target star magnitude and the spatio-temporal distribution of wavefront errors
from the telescope. In cases with significant vibration, we advocate for the use of laser metrology
to mitigate high temporal frequency wavefront errors and increase the mission yield.

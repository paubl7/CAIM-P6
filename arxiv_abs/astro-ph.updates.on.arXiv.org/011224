Measures of discordance between datasets have become an essential part of cosmological analyses.
It is important to accurately evaluate the significance of such discordances when present. We propose
here a Bayesian interpretation of inconsistency measures that can extract information about physical
inconsistencies in the presence of data scatter. The new framework is based on the conditional probability
distribution of the level of physical inconsistency given the obtained value of the measure. We
use the index of inconsistency as a case study to illustrate the new interpretation framework, but
this can be generalized to other metrics. Importantly, there are two aspects in the quantification
of inconsistency that behave differently as the number of model parameters increases. The first
is the probability for the level of physical inconsistency to reach a threshold which drops with
the increase of the number of parameters under consideration. Then the second is the actual level
of physical inconsistency which remains rather insensitive to such an increase in parameters.
This often-overlooked ambiguity leads to an underestimation of the physical inconsistency by
the commonly adopted significance level when used, but is resolved by the Bayesian interpretation
because the conditional probability distribution includes all the statistical information of
the level of physical inconsistency. Finally, we apply the Bayesian interpretation to examine
the (in)consistency between Planck versus the Cepheid-based local measurement, the Dark Energy
Survey (DES), the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) and WMAP. We confirm and revisit the degrees
of previous physical inconsistencies and show the stability of the new interpretation to the number
of cosmological parameters compared to the commonly used n-$\sigma$ interpretation when applied
to cosmological tensions in multi-parameter spaces.

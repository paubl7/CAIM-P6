The knowledge of the binding energy of molecules on astrophysically relevant ices can help to obtain
an estimate of the desorption rate, i.e. the molecules residence time on the surface. This represents
an important parameter for astrochemical models, crucial to determine the chemical fate of complex
organic molecules formed on dust grains and observed in the densest regions of the interstellar
medium. In this work, we propose a new robust procedure to study the interaction of atoms and molecules
with interstellar ices, based on \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics and density functional
theory, validated by high-level \textit{ab initio} methods at a CCSD(T)/CBS level. We have applied
this procedure to hydrogen fluoride (HF), a promising tracer of the molecular content of galaxies.
In total we found 13 unique equilibrium structures of HF binding to small water clusters of up to 4
molecules, with binding energies ranging from 1208 to 7162 K. We computed a 22-molecules model of
amorphous solid water (ASW) surface using \textit{ab initio} molecular dynamics simulations
and carried out a systematic analysis of the binding sites of HF, in terms of binding modes and binding
energies. Considering 10 different water clusters, we found a binding energy distribution with
an average value of $5313\pm74$ K, and a dispersion of $921\pm115$ K. Finally, the effect of the electrostatic
field of the 22 water molecules on the binding energies was investigated incrementally by symmetry
adapted perturbation theory, in order to gauge the effect of the water environment. The results
indicate that the extent of the electrostatic interaction of HF with ASW depends strongly on the
properties of the binding site. We expect that this work will provide a solid foundation for a systematic
development of a binding energy distribution database of molecules on interstellar surfaces.

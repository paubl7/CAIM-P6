Elements in the interstellar medium (ISM) exist in the form of gas or dust. The interstellar extinction
and elemental abundances provide crucial constraints on the composition, size and quantity of
interstellar dust. Most of the extinction modeling efforts have assumed the total abundances (both
in gas and in dust) of the dust-forming elements---known as the "interstellar abundances", the
"interstellar reference abundances", or the "cosmic abundances"---to be solar and the gas-phase
abundances to be independent of the interstellar environments. However, it remains unclear if
the solar abundances are an appropriate representation of the interstellar abundances. Meanwhile,
the gas-phase abundances are known to exhibit appreciable variations with the local interstellar
environments. In this work we explore the viability of the abundances of B stars, the solar and protosolar
abundances, and the protosolar abundances augmented by Galactic chemical enrichment (GCE) as
an appropriate representation of the interstellar abundances by quantitatively examining the
extinction and elemental abundances of ten interstellar lines of sight for which both the extinction
curves and the gas-phase abundances of all the major dust-forming elements (i.e., C, O, Mg, Si and
Fe) have been observationally determined. Instead of assuming a specific dust model and then fitting
the observed extinction curves, for each sightline we apply the model-independent Kramers-Kronig
relation, which relates the wavelength-integrated extinction to the total dust volume, to place
a lower limit on the dust depletion. This, together with the observationally-derived gas-phase
abundances, allows us to rule out the B-star, solar, and protosolar abundances as the interstellar
reference standard. We conclude that the GCE-augmented protosolar abundances are a viable representation
of the interstellar abundances.

We investigate the spatially-resolved morphology of galaxies in the early Universe. We consider
a typical redshift z = 6 Lyman Break galaxy, "Althaea" from the SERRA hydrodynamical simulations.
We create mock rest-frame ultraviolet, optical, and far-infrared observations, and perform a
two-dimensional morphological analysis to de-blend the galaxy disk from substructures (merging
satellites or star-forming regions). We find that the [CII]158um emitting region has an effective
radius 1.5 - 2.5 times larger than the optical one, consistent with recent observations. This [CII]
halo in our simulated galaxy arises as the joint effect of stellar outflows and carbon photoionization
by the galaxy UV field, rather than from the emission of unresolved nearby satellites. At the typical
angular resolution of current observations (> 0.15") only merging satellites can be detected;
detection of star-forming regions requires resolutions of < 0.05". The [CII]-detected satellite
has a 2.5 kpc projected distance from the galaxy disk, whereas the star-forming regions are embedded
in the disk itself (distance < 1 kpc). This suggests that multi-component systems reported in the
literature, which have separations > 2 kpc, are merging satellites, rather than galactic substructures.
Finally, the star-forming regions found in our mock maps follow the local L[CII] - SFR_UV relation
of galaxy disks, although sampling the low-luminosity, low-SFR tail of the distribution. We show
that future JWST observations, bridging UV and [CII] datasets, will be exceptionally suited to
characterize galaxy substructures thanks to their exquisite spatial resolution and sensitivity
to both low-metallicity and dust-obscured regions that are bright at infrared wavelengths.

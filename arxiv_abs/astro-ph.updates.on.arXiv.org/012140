A variety of kinetic waves develop in the solar wind. The relationship between these waves and larger-scale
structures, such as current sheets and ongoing turbulence remain a topic of investigation. Similarly,
the instabilities producing ion-acoustic waves in the solar wind remains an open question. The
goals of this paper are to investigate kinetic electrostatic Langmuir and ion-acoustic waves in
the solar wind at 0.5 AU and determine whether current sheets and associated streaming instabilities
can produce the observed waves. The relationship between these waves and currents is investigated
statistically. Solar Orbiter's Radio and Plasma Waves instrument suite provides high-resolution
snapshots of the fluctuating electric field. The Low Frequency Receiver resolves the waveforms
of ion-acoustic waves and the Time Domain Sampler resolves the waveforms of both ion-acoustic and
Langmuir waves. Using these waveform data we determine when these waves are observed in relation
to current structures in the solar wind, estimated from the background magnetic field. Langmuir
and ion-acoustic waves are frequently observed in the solar wind. Ion-acoustic waves are observed
about 1% of the time at 0.5 AU. The waves are more likely to be observed in regions of enhanced currents.
However, the waves typically do not occur at current structures themselves. The observed currents
in the solar wind are too small to drive instability by the relative drift between single ion and electron
populations. When multi-component ion and/or electron distributions are present the observed
currents may be sufficient for instability. Ion beams are the most plausible source of ion-acoustic
waves. The spacecraft potential is confirmed to be a reliable probe of the background electron density
by comparing the peak frequencies of Langmuir waves with the plasma frequency calculated from the
spacecraft potential.

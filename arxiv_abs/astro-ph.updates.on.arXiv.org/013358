(Abriged) Blue compact galaxies (BCGs) are low-luminosity, metal-poor, gas-rich objects that
form stars at high rates, excellent analogs to the high-redshift star-forming galaxy population.
Being low-mass starbursts, they also constitute ideal laboratories for investigating star formation
and massive stellar feedback. This work presents results from integral field spectroscopic observations
of the BCG Haro 14 taken with the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). The large MUSE field of
view enables simultaneous observations of the starburst and the host galaxy. We built galaxy maps
in continuum and in emission lines and generated synthetic VRI images, from which we produced color
index maps and surface brightness profiles. We detected numerous clumps spread throughout the
galaxy, both in continuum and in emission lines, and produced a catalog with their position, size,
and photometry. This analysis allowed us to study the morphology and stellar populations of Haro
14 in detail. The stellar distribution shows a pronounced asymmetry; the intensity peak in continuum
is not centered with respect to the stellar host but is displaced by about 500 pc southwest. At the
position of the continuum peak we find a bright stellar cluster that with M$_{V}=-12.18$ appears
as a strong super stellar cluster candidate. We also find a highly asymmetric, blue, but nonionizing
stellar component that occupies almost the whole eastern part of the galaxy. We conclude that there
are at least three different stellar populations in Haro 14: the current starburst of about 6 Myr;
an intermediate-age component of between ten and several hundred million years; and a red and regular
host of several gigayears. The pronounced lopsidedness in the continuum and also in the color maps,
and the presence of numerous stellar clusters, are consistent with a scenario of mergers or interactions
acting in Haro 14.

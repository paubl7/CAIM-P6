Late time cosmic acceleration may be achieved by modifying gravity on large scales. This should
also have consequences on the evolution of perturbations. We thus extend our study of exponential
infrared $f(T)$ teleparallel gravity to examine the viability of the theory at the linear perturbation
level, evaluating the full CMB and matter power spectra. As the theory does not introduce extra free
parameters, it fits within the minimal six parameter space of standard $\Lambda$CDM. Using Planck
2018 CMB (TT+TE+EE+lensing) alone, best fits predict those parameters to be almost identical to
$\Lambda$CDM, with slightly smaller $\chi^2_{min}$. The resulting $H_0=72.24\pm 0.64$ km/s/Mpc,
which "practically" alleviates the tension with local measurements, due to late time phantom behaviour.
Inclusion of BAO data however reduces $H_0$, reflecting furthermore systematic deviations from
data that are also present in supernova distances and the growth rate of structure (increasing the
apparent tension in the latter case). As the theory, unlike other viable $f(T)$ models, does not
reduce to $\Lambda$CDM through extra free parameters, those conclusions are generic; applying
to any modified gravity or dynamical dark energy with phantom behaviour. With best fit parameters,
the present scenario produces a CMB spectrum almost identical to $\Lambda$CDM, with slight deviation
at low-multipole $\ell < 30$, where cosmic variance is large. The matter power spectrum is also quite
close to $\Lambda$CDM; with percent level scale free modifications affecting modes significantly
smaller than the horizon, arising primarily from modified background evolution. More significant
deviations appear on larger scales, and may in principle distinguish modified gravity scenarios
of the type studied here from dynamical dark energy.

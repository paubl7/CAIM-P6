Context. Recent observations by the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUI) on board Solar Orbiter have
characterized prevalent small-scale transient brightenings in the corona above the quiet Sun
termed campfires. Aims. In this study we search for comparable brightenings in a numerical model
and then investigate their relation to the magnetic field and the processes that drive these events.
Methods. We use the MURaM code to solve the 3D radiation MHD equations in a box that stretches from
the upper convection zone to the corona. The model self-consistently produces a supergranular
network of the magnetic field and a hot corona above this quiet Sun. For the comparison with the model
we synthesize the coronal emission as seen by EUI in its 174 {\AA} channel, isolate the seven strongest
transient brightenings, and investigate (the changes of) the magnetic field in and around these
in detail. Results. The transients we isolate have a lifetime of about 2 minutes and are elongated
loop-like features with lengths around 1Mm to 4 Mm. They tend to occur at heights of about 2Mm to 5Mm
above the photosphere a bit offset from magnetic concentrations that mark the bright chromospheric
network and they reach temperatures of above 1 MK. With this they very much resemble the (larger)
campfires found in observations. In our model most events are energised by component reconnection
between (bundles of) field lines that interact at coronal heights. In one case we find that untwisting
of a highly twisted flux rope initiates the heating. Conclusions. Based on our study we propose that
the majority of campfire events found by EUI are driven by component reconnection and our model suggests
that this process contributes significantly to the heating of the corona above the quiet Sun.

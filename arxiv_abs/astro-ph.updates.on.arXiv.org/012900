The recent star formation histories (SFHs) of post-starburst galaxies have been determined almost
exclusively from detailed modeling of their composite star light. This has provided important
but limited information on the number, strength, and duration of bursts of star formation. In this
work, we present a direct and independent measure of the recent SFH of S12 (plate-mjd-fiber for SDSS
623-52051-207; designated EAS12 in Smercina et al. 2018) from its star cluster population. We detect
clusters from high resolution, $UBR$ optical observations from HST, and compare their luminosities
and colors with stellar population models to estimate the ages and masses of the clusters. No clusters
younger than $\sim$70 Myr are found, indicating star formation shut off at this time. Clusters formed
$\sim$120 Myr ago reach masses up to $\sim \mbox{few}\times10^7~M_{\odot}$, several times higher
than similar age counterparts formed in actively merging galaxies like the Antennae and NGC 3256.
We develop a new calibration based on known properties for 8 nearby galaxies to estimate the star
formation rate (SFR) of a galaxy from the mass of the most massive cluster, $M_{\rm max}$. The cluster
population indicates that S12 experienced an extremely intense but short-lived burst $\sim$120
Myr ago, with an estimated peak of $500^{+500}_{-250}~M_{\odot}~\mbox{yr}^{-1}$ and duration
of $50\pm25$ Myr, one of the highest SFRs estimated for any galaxy in the nearby universe. Prior to
the recent, intense burst, S12 was forming stars at a moderate rate of $\sim 3{-}5~M_{\odot}~\mbox{yr}^{-1}$,
typical of spiral galaxies. However, the system also experienced an earlier burst approximately
$1{-}3$ Gyr ago. While fairly uncertain, we estimate that the SFR during this earlier burst was $\sim20{-}30~M_{\odot}~\mbox{yr}^{-1}$,
similar to the current SFR in the Antennae and NGC 3256.

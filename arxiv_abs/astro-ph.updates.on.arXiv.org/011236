We study static spherically symmetric anisotropic fluid solutions of the Einstein equations in
curvature coordinates to find algorithms that generate all solutions of the system and sub-algorithms
that generate all solutions that are regular at the center. For this, we study all possible combinations
of input functions from the set of four functions that characterize the anisotropic system and revisit
the conditions for central regularity of fluid spheres (isotropic and anisotropic) to see how different
sets of initial conditions serve as equivalent sets for regularity. We provide the first regularity
analysis of the solutions generated by the well-known algorithm that uses the potential function
and anisotropy. This includes the algorithm for the isotropic system as a special case. We show that
the one-parameter family of solutions produced by either algorithm are regular at the center for
the usual initial conditions for the input functions; these conditions by themselves are inadequate
for geometric regularity, but the Einstein equations fill the gap. By reformulating the anisotropic
algorithm in terms of the potential function and tangential pressure, all regular anisotropic
solutions can further be obtained in a 1-1 fashion with the input. This allows us to interpret the
parameter in the existing algorithms for the isotropic and anisotropic systems as the central density.
For three other choices of input function pairs (any two of the three functions: the potential function,
density, and radial pressure), a remarkably straightforward algorithm follows. The equivalency
of the three pairs in this algorithm arises precisely because of the same algebraic relation between
these three functions that made the different equivalent sets of regularity conditions possible.
This makes this algorithm very streamlined for generating regular anisotropic solutions.

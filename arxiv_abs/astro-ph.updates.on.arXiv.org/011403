We study the evolution of the binary black hole (BBH) mass distribution across cosmic time. The second
gravitational-wave transient catalog (GWTC-2) from LIGO/Virgo contains BBH events out to redshifts
$z \sim 1$, with component masses in the range $\sim5$--$80\,M_\odot$. In this catalog, the biggest
black holes, with $m_1 \gtrsim 45\,M_\odot$, are only found at the highest redshifts, $z \gtrsim
0.4$. We ask whether the absence of high-mass BBH observations at low redshift indicates that the
astrophysical BBH mass distribution evolves: the biggest BBHs only merge at high redshift, and
cease merging at low redshift. Alternatively, this feature might be explained by gravitational-wave
selection effects. Modeling the BBH primary mass spectrum as a power law with a sharp maximum mass
cutoff (Truncated model), we find that the cutoff increases with redshift ($> 99.9\%$ credibility).
An abrupt cutoff in the mass spectrum is expected from (pulsational) pair instability supernova
simulations; however, GWTC-2 is only consistent with a Truncated mass model if the location of the
cutoff increases from $45^{+13}_{-5}\,M_\odot$ at $z < 0.4$ to $80^{+16}_{-13}\,M_\odot$ at
$z > 0.4$. Alternatively, if the primary mass spectrum has a break in the power law (Broken power law)
at ${38^{+15}_{-8}\,M_\odot}$, rather than a sharp cutoff, the data are consistent with a non-evolving
mass distribution. In this case, the overall rate of mergers, at all masses, increases with increasing
redshift. Future observations will confidently distinguish between a sharp maximum mass cutoff
that evolves with redshift and a non-evolving mass distribution with a gradual taper, such as a Broken
power law. After $\sim 100$ BBH merger observations, a continued absence of high-mass, low-redshift
events would provide a clear signature that the mass distribution evolves with redshift.

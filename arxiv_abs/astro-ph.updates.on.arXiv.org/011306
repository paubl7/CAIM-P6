We report the results of a pilot spectroscopic program of a region at z=5.2 in the GOODS-N field containing
an overdensity of galaxies around the well-known submillimeter galaxy HDF850.1. We have selected
candidate cluster members from the optical 25 medium-band photometric catalog of the project SHARDS
(Survey for High-z Absorption Red and Dead Sources). 17 rest-frame UV selected galaxies (LAEs and
LBGs) with 5.15<z_phot<5.27, candidates to be physically associated with the overdensity, have
been observed with the instrument OSIRIS at the GranTeCan telescope. 13 out of these 17 (76 per cent)
sources have secure spectroscopic confirmations via the Ly$\alpha$ line at the redshift of the
galaxy protocluster PCl$-$HDF850.1, demonstrating the high reliabilty of our photometric redshift
method. 10 out of 13 sources are newly confirmed members. Thus, we increase the number of confirmed
members in this overdensity from 13 to 23 objects. In order to fully characterize this structure
we combined our dataset with the sample from the literature. Beside the SMG HDF850.1, none of the
23 spectroscopically confirmed members are bright in the far-infrared/submm wavelength regime
(SFR_IR< few hundred M_sun yr^-1). The clustering analysis of the whole sample of 23 confirmed members
reveals four distinct components in physical space in different evolutionary states, within Delta_z<0.04
from the central region hosting SMG HDF850.1. The halo mass of the whole structure at z=5.2, estimated
by a variety of methods, range between 2-8 x 10^12 M_sun. The comparison with literature suggests
a large scale assembly comparable to the formation of a central Virgo-like cluster at z=0 with several
satellite components which will possibly be incorporated in a single halo if the protocluster is
the progenitor of a more massive Coma-like cluster (>10^15 M_sun).

Climate change is a major impending threat to the future of humanity. According to the International
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), our emissions are estimated to have caused 0.8 deg C-1.2 deg C of anthropogenic
global warming (AGW) above pre-industrial levels. AGW is likely to reach 1.5 degrees C between 2030
and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate. As the climate change is driven by the release
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases (GHG) into the atmosphere, there is a broad consensus
that the mitigation of climate change requires transition to low GHG emission energy sources, technologies
and practices. Implementing such changes systematically from individual to community-wide scales
together with the resulting cultural changes and leadership towards environmental consciousness
and responsibility are crucial to mitigate the looming damage of AGW. Given planetary scientists'
wide recognition of the realities of climate change, and the need for us to maintain credibility
by leading by example, it is appropriate to make own professional behavior more environmentally
responsible. While scientists are few in numbers, and planetary scientists far fewer, high volumes
of academic travel to conferences, panels, colloquia, and research collaboration visits together
with extensive use of large, energetically demanding infrastructures make the "carbon footprint"
of scientists much higher than that of an average citizen. This White Paper focuses on how modifying
our activities, particularly associated with academic travel, can affect the carbon footprint
of the planetary science community, and it makes recommendations on how the community and the funding
agencies could best participate in the cultural change required to mitigate the damage that AGW
will cause.

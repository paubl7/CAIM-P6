We summarize the channels formation of neutron stars (NS) in single or binary evolution and the classic
recycling scenario by which mass accretion by a donor companion accelerates old NS to millisecond
pulsars (MSP). We consider the possible explanations and requirements for the high frequency of
the MSP population in Globular Clusters. Basics of binary evolution are given, and the key concepts
of systemic angular momentum losses are first discussed in the framework of the secular evolution
of Cataclysmic Binaries. MSP binaries with compact companions represent end-points of previous
evolution. In the class of systems characterized by short orbital period and low companion mass,
we may instead be catching the recycling phase `in the act'. These systems are in fact either MSP,
or low mass X--ray binaries (LMXB), some of which accreting X-ray MSP (AMXP), or even `transitional'
systems from the accreting to the radio MSP stage. The donor structure is affected by irradiation
due to X-rays from the accreting NS, or by the high fraction of MSP rotational energy loss emitted
in the gamma rays range of the energy spectrum. X-ray irradiation leads to cyclic LMXB stages, causing
super-Eddington mass transfer rates during the first phases of the companion evolution, and, possibly
coupled with the angular momentum carried away by the non-accreted matter, helps to explain the
high positive orbital period derivatives of some LMXB systems and account for the (apparently)
different birthrates of LMXB and MSP. Irradiation by the MSP may be able to drive the donor to a stage
in which either radio-ejection (in the redbacks) or mass loss due to the companion expansion, and
`evaporation' may govern the evolution to the black widow stage and to the final disruption of the
companion.

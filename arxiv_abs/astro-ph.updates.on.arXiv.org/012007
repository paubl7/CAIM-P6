Galactic Internet may already exist, if all stars are exploited as gravitational lenses. In fact,
the gravitational lens of the Sun is a well-known astrophysical phenomenon predicted by Einstein's
general theory of relativity. It implies that, if we can send a probe along any radial direction away
from the Sun up to the minimal distance of 550 AU and beyond, the Sun's mass will act as a huge magnifying
lens, letting us "see" detailed radio maps of whatever may lie on the other side of the Sun even at very
large distances. The 2009 book by this author, ref. [1], studies such future FOCAL space missions
to 550 AU and beyond. In this paper, however, we want to study another possibility yet: how to create
the future interstellar radio links between the solar system and any future interstellar probe
by utilizing the gravitational lens of the Sun as a huge antenna. In particular, we study the Bit Error
Rate (BER) across interstellar distances with and without using the gravitational lens effect
of the Sun (ref. [2]). The conclusion is that only when we will exploit the Sun as a gravitational lens
we will be able to communicate with our own probes (or with nearby Aliens) across the distances of
even the nearest stars to us in the Galaxy, and that at a reasonable Bit Error Rate. We also study the
radio bridge between the Sun and any other Star that is made up by the two gravitational lenses of both
the Sun and that Star. The alignment for this radio bridge to work is very strict, but the power-saving
is enormous, due to the huge contributions of the two stars' lenses to the overall antenna gain of
the system. We study a few cases in detail. Finally, we find the information channel capacity for
each of those radio bridges, putting thus a physical constraint to the amount of information transfer
that will be possible even by exploiting the stars as gravitational lenses

(Abridged) We present a large sample of o-H$_2$D$^+$ observations in high-mass star-forming regions
and discuss possible empirical correlations with relevant physical quantities to assess its role
as a chronometer of star-forming regions through different evolutionary stages. APEX observations
of the ground-state transition of o-H$_2$D$^+$ were analysed in a sample of massive clumps selected
from ATLASGAL at different evolutionary stages. Column densities and beam-averaged abundances
of o-H$_2$D$^+$ with respect to H$_2$, $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$), were obtained by modelling the spectra
under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. We detect 16 sources in o-H$_2$D$^+$
and find clear correlations between $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$) and the clump bolometric luminosity and
the dust temperature, while only a mild correlation is found with the CO-depletion factor. In addition,
we see a clear correlation with the luminosity-to-mass ratio, which is known to trace the evolution
of the star formation process. This would indicate that the deuterated forms of H$_3^+$ are more
abundant in the early stages of the star formation process and that deuteration is influenced by
the time evolution of the clumps. In this respect, our findings would suggest that the $X$(o-H$_2$D$^+$)
abundance is mainly affected by the thermal changes rather than density changes in the gas. We have
employed these findings together with observations of H$^{13}$CO$^+$, DCO$^+$, and C$^{17}$O
to provide an estimate of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate in a sub-sample of eight clumps based on
recent analytical work. Our study presents the largest sample of o-H$_2$D$^+$ in star-forming
regions to date. The results confirm that the deuteration process is strongly affected by temperature
and suggests that o-H$_2$D$^+$ can be considered a reliable chemical clock during the star formation
processes, as proved by its strong temporal dependence.

We present the temporal and spectral study of blazar PKS 0208-512, using recent flaring activity
from November 2019 to March 2020, as detected by Fermi-LAT, Swift-XRT/UVOT observatories. The
source was in a low ${\gamma}$-ray flux state for a decade and started flaring in November 2019, which
continues until March 2020. During the activity state, 2-days binned ${\gamma}$-ray lightcurve
shows multiple-peaks indicating sub-flares. To understand the possible physical mechanisms
behind flux enhancement, a detailed temporal and spectral study has been carried out by dividing
the activity into several flux-states. Timing analysis of lightcurves suggests that peaks of sub-flares
have rise and decay time in days-order with flux-doubling time $\sim$ 2-days. The 2-days binned
${\gamma}$-ray lightcurve shows double-lognormal flux distribution. The broadband spectral
energy distribution for three selected flux states can be well fitted under synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton
(SSC) and external-Compton (EC) emission mechanisms. We obtained the physical parameters of the
source and their confidence intervals through ${\chi}^2$-statistics. Our spectral study suggests
that during quiescent-state, gamma-ray spectrum can be well explained by considering the EC-scattering
of IR-photons from the dusty-torus. However, gamma-ray spectra corresponding to flares demand
additional target photons from broad-line-region (BLR) along with the IR. These suggest that during
flares, the emission-region is close to the edge of BLR, while for quiescent-state the emission-region
is away from the BLR. The best-fit results suggest that, marginal increase in the magnetic-field
can result in the flux enhancement. This is possibly associated with the efficiency of particle
acceleration during flaring-states as compared to quiescent-state.

We investigate the impact on convective numerical simulations of thermo-compositional diabatic
processes. We focus our study on simulations with a stabilizing temperature gradient and a destabilizing
mean-molecular weight gradient. We aim to establish the possibility for a reduced temperature-gradient
in such setups. A suite of 3D simulations were conducted using a numerical hydrodynamic code. We
used as a simplified test case, a sample region of the secondary atmosphere of a hot rocky exoplanet
within which the chemical transition CO+O $\leftrightarrow$ CO$_{2}$ could occur. Newtonian
cooling and a chemical source term was used to maintain a negative mean molecular weight gradient.
Our results demonstrate that this setup can reduce the temperature gradient, a result which does
not converge away with resolution or over time. We also show that the presence of the reduced temperature
gradient is a function of the forcing timescales. The above transition leads to a bifurcation of
the temperature profile when the chemical forcing is fast, reminiscent of the bifurcation seen
in the boiling crisis for steam/liquid convection. With the reduced temperature gradient in these
idealized setups, there exists the possibility for an analogy of the reddening (currently observed
in the spectra of brown dwarfs) in the spectra of rocky exoplanet atmospheres. Detailed 1D modelling
is needed, in order to characterize the equilibrium thermal and compositional gradients, the timescales,
and the impact of a realistic equation of state, in order to assess if the regime identified here will
develop in realistic situations. This possibility cannot, however, be excluded a priori. This
prediction is new for terrestrial atmospheres and represents strong motivation for the use of diabatic
models when analysing atmospheric spectra of rocky exoplanets that will be observed with e.g. the
James Webb Space Telescope.

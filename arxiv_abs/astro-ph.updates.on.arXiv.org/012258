In the currently favored cosmological paradigm galaxies form hierarchically through the accretion
of numerous satellite galaxies. Since the satellites are much less massive than the host halo, they
occupy a small fraction of the volume in action space defined by the potential of the host halo. Since
actions are conserved when the potential of the host halo changes adiabatically, stars from an accreted
satellite are expected to remain clustered in action space as the host halo evolves. In this paper,
we identify accreted satellites in three Milky Way like disk galaxies from the cosmological baryonic
FIRE-2 simulations by tracking satellite galaxies through simulation snapshots. We then try to
recover these satellites by applying the cluster analysis algorithm Enlink to the orbital actions
of accreted star particles in the present-day snapshot. We define several metrics to quantify the
success of the clustering algorithm and use these metrics to identify well-recovered and poorly-recovered
satellites. We plot these satellites in the infall time-progenitor mass (or stellar mass) space,
and determine the boundaries between the well-recovered and poorly-recovered satellites in these
two spaces with classification tree method. The groups found by Enlink are more likely to correspond
to a real satellite if they have high significance, a quantity assigned by Enlink. Since cosmological
simulations predict that most stellar halos have a population of insitu stars, we test the ability
of Enlink to recover satellites when the sample is contaminated by 10-50% of insitu star particles,
and show that most of the satellites well-recovered by Enlink in the absence of insitu stars, stay
well-recovered even with 50% contamination. We thus expect that, in the future, cluster analysis
in action space will be useful in upcoming data sets (e.g. Gaia) for identifying accreted satellites
in the Milky Way.

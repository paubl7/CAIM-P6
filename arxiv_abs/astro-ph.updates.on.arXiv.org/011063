The Milky Way hosts on average a few supernova explosions per century, yet in the past millennium
only five supernovae have been identified confidently in the historical record. This deficit of
naked-eye supernovae is at least partly due to dust extinction in the Galactic plane. We explore
this effect quantitatively, developing a formalism for the supernova probability distribution,
accounting for dust and for the observer's flux limit. We then construct a fiducial axisymmetric
model for the supernova and dust densities, featuring an exponential dependence on galactocentric
radius and height, with core-collapse events in a thin disk and Type Ia events including a thick disk
component. When no flux limit is applied, our model predicts supernovae are intrinsically concentrated
in the Galactic plane, with Type Ia events extending to higher latitudes reflecting their thick
disk component. We then apply a flux limit and include dust effects, to predict the sky distribution
of historical supernovae. We use well-observed supernovae as light-curve templates, and introduce
naked-eye discovery criteria. The resulting sky distributions are strikingly inconsistent with
the locations of confident historical supernovae, none of which lie near our model's central peaks.
Indeed, SN 1054 lies off the plane almost exactly in the anticenter, and SN 1181 is in the 2nd Galactic
quadrant. We discuss possible explanations for these discrepancies. We calculate the percentage
of all supernovae bright enough for historical discovery: $\simeq 13\%$ of core-collapse and $\simeq
33\%$ of Type Ia events. Using these and the confident historical supernovae, we estimate the intrinsic
Galactic supernova rates, finding general agreement with other methods. Finally, we urge searches
for supernovae in historical records from civilizations in the southern hemisphere.

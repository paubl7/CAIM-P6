Submillimeter interferometry has the potential to image supermassive black holes on event horizon
scales, providing tests of the theory of general relativity and increasing our understanding of
black hole accretion processes. The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) performs these observations
from the ground, and its main imaging targets are Sagittarius A* in the Galactic Center and the black
hole at the center of the M87 galaxy. However, the EHT is fundamentally limited in its performance
by atmospheric effects and sparse terrestrial $(u,v)$-coverage (Fourier sampling of the image).
The scientific interest in quantitative studies of the horizon size and shape of these black holes
has motivated studies into using space interferometry which is free of these limitations. Angular
resolution considerations and interstellar scattering effects push the desired observing frequency
to bands above 500 GHz. This paper presents the requirements for meeting these science goals, describes
the concept of interferometry from Polar or Equatorial Medium Earth Orbits (PECMEO) which we dub
the Event Horizon Imager (EHI), and utilizes suitable space technology heritage. In this concept,
two or three satellites orbit at slightly different orbital radii, resulting in a dense and uniform
spiral-shaped $(u,v)$-coverage over time. The local oscillator signals are shared via an inter-satellite
link, and the data streams are correlated on-board before final processing on the ground. Inter-satellite
metrology and satellite positioning are extensively employed to facilitate the knowledge of the
instrument position vector, and its time derivative. The European space heritage usable for both
the front ends and the antenna technology of such an instrument is investigated. Current and future
sensors for the required inter-satellite metrology are listed. Intended performance estimates
and simulation results are given.

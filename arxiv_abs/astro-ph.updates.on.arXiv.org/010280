ESPRESSO is the new high-resolution spectrograph of ESO's Very-Large Telescope (VLT). It was designed
for ultra-high radial-velocity precision and extreme spectral fidelity with the aim of performing
exoplanet research and fundamental astrophysical experiments with unprecedented precision
and accuracy. It is able to observe with any of the four Unit Telescopes (UT) of the VLT at a spectral
resolving power of 140,000 or 190,000 over the 378.2 to 788.7 nm wavelength range, or with all UTs
together, turning the VLT into a 16-m diameter equivalent telescope in terms of collecting area,
while still providing a resolving power of 70,000. We provide a general description of the ESPRESSO
instrument, report on the actual on-sky performance, and present our Guaranteed-Time Observation
(GTO) program with its first results. ESPRESSO was installed on the Paranal Observatory in fall
2017. Commissioning (on-sky testing) was conducted between December 2017 and September 2018.
The instrument saw its official start of operations on October 1st, 2018, but improvements to the
instrument and re-commissioning runs were conducted until July 2019. The measured overall optical
throughput of ESPRESSO at 550 nm and a seeing of 0.65 arcsec exceeds the 10% mark under nominal astro-climatic
conditions. We demonstrate a radial-velocity precision of better than 25 cm/s during one night
and 50 cm/s over several months. These values being limited by photon noise and stellar jitter show
that the performanceis compatible with an instrumental precision of 10 cm/s. No difference has
been measured across the UTs neither in throughput nor RV precision. The combination of the large
collecting telescope area with the efficiency and the exquisite spectral fidelity of ESPRESSO
opens a new parameter space in RV measurements, the study of planetary atmospheres, fundamental
constants, stellar characterisation and many other fields.

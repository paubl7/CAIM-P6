Galaxy surface density maps reveal the clustering of red and blue galaxies around 3C radio galaxies
and quasars at $1<z<2.5$. The maps are made from optical and near-infrared $HST$ images with a 2'
field-of-view, where the filters encompass the 4000{\AA} break. 16 of 21 radio sources lie inside
a galaxy overdensity of less than 250kpc ($30"$) projected radius; the overdensity is defined as
3$\sigma$ above the mean galaxy density of the periphery ($30"-60"$). We find a spatial galaxy segregation
with brightness and color as well as evolution with redshift. At $z < 1.5$, the overdensity is dominated
by red galaxies, while blue galaxies are more frequent in the periphery. With a few exceptions, the
fainter galaxies contributing to the overdensity are bluer than the brighter galaxies. The derived
number of central luminous red galaxies is comparable to that of the Coma cluster core. This and the
brightness and color segregation of candidate cluster member galaxies leads us to conclude that
at $1 < z < 1.5$ the 3C sources are not just becoming galaxy groups. Rather we suggest that the foundation
of a galaxy cluster with luminous red galaxies has largely been set, and the formation of the red sequence
is still going on from a reservoir of blue galaxies in the periphery. At $z > 1.5$, overdensities are
less frequent and progressively composed of blue galaxies. Compared to $z<1.5$, the lower galaxy
concentration and bluer nature of potential cluster member galaxies indicate that a 3C cluster
at $z > 1.5$ is in an earlier assembly phase. The clustering of galaxies around high-redshift 3C sources
appears to precede with a few exceptions the assembly of detectable mass concentrations and of extended
hot X-ray gas found for most of the lower-redshift 3C sources.

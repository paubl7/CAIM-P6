In order to constrain the models describing circumstellar environments, it is necessary to solve
the radiative transfer equation in the presence of absorption and scattering, coupled with the
equation for radiative equilibrium. However, solving this problem requires much CPU time, which
makes the use of automatic minimisation procedures to characterise these environments challenging.
The use of approximate methods is then of primary interest. One promising candidate method is the
flux-limited diffusion (FLD), which recasts the radiative transfer problem into a non-linear
diffusion equation. One important aspect for the accuracy of the method lies in the implementation
of appropriate boundary conditions (BCs). We present new BCs for the FLD approximation in circumstellar
environments that we apply here to spherically symmetric envelopes. At the inner boundary, the
entering flux (coming from the star and from the envelope itself) may be written in the FLD formalism
and provides us with an adequate BC. At the free outer boundary, we used the FLD formalism to constrain
the ratio of the mean radiation intensity over the emerging flux. In both cases we derived non-linear
mixed BCs relating the surface values of the mean specific intensity and its gradient. We implemented
these conditions and compared the results with previous benchmarks and the results of a Monte Carlo
radiative transfer code. A comparison with results derived from BCs that were previously proposed
in other contexts is presented as well. For all the tested cases, the average relative difference
with the benchmark results is below 2\% for the temperature profile and below 6\% for the corresponding
spectral energy distribution or the emerging flux. We point out that the FLD method together with
the new outer BC also allows us to derive an approximation for the emerging flux.

Gravitational waves (GWs) directly measure the luminosity distance to the merger, which, when
combined with an independent measurement of the source's redshift, provides a novel probe of cosmology.
The proposed next generation of ground-based GW detectors, Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer,
will detect tens of thousands of binary neutron stars (BNSs) out to cosmological distances ($z>2$),
beyond the peak of the star formation rate (SFR), or "cosmic noon." At these distances, it will be
challenging to measure the sources' redshifts by observing electromagnetic (EM) counterparts
or statistically marginalizing over a galaxy catalog. In the absence of an EM counterpart or galaxy
catalog, Ding et al. showed that theoretical priors on the merger redshift distribution can be used
to infer parameters in a $w$CDM cosmology. We argue that in the BNS case, the redshift distribution
will be measured by independent observations of short gamma ray bursts (GRBs), kilonovae, and known
BNS host galaxies. We show that, in addition to measuring the background cosmology, this method
can constrain the effects of dark energy on modified GW propagation. We consider the simple case
in which the BNS rate is \textit{a priori} known to follow the SFR. If the SFR is perfectly known, $\mathcal{O}(10,000)$
events (to be expected within a year of observation with Cosmic Explorer) would yield a sub-tenth
percent measurement of the combination $H_0^{2.8}\Omega_M$. Fixing $H_0$ and $\Omega_M$, this
method may enable a 5\% measurement of the dark energy equation of state parameter. Fixing the background
cosmology and probing modified GW propagation, the running of the Planck mass parameter $c_M$ may
be measured to $\pm0.02$. Although realistically, the redshift evolution of the merger rate will
be uncertain, prior knowledge of the peak redshift will provide valuable information for standard
siren analyses.

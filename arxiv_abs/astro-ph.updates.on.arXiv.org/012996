Signatures of vertical disequilibrium have been observed across the Milky Way's disk. These signatures
manifest locally as unmixed phase-spirals in $z$--$v_z$ space ("snails-in-phase") and globally
as nonzero mean $z$ and $v_z$ which wraps around as a physical spiral across the $x$--$y$ plane ("snails-in-space").
We explore the connection between these local and global spirals through the example of a satellite
perturbing a test-particle Milky Way (MW)-like disk. We anticipate our results to broadly apply
to any vertical perturbation. Using a $z$--$v_z$ asymmetry metric we demonstrate that in test-particle
simulations: (a) multiple local phase-spiral morphologies appear when stars are binned by azimuthal
action $J_\phi$, excited by a single event (in our case, a satellite disk-crossing); (b) these distinct
phase-spirals are traced back to distinct disk locations; and (c) they are excited at distinct times.
Thus, local phase-spirals offer a global view of the MW's perturbation history from multiple perspectives.
Using a toy model for a Sagittarius (Sgr)-like satellite crossing the disk, we show that the full
interaction takes place on timescales comparable to orbital periods of disk stars within $R \lesssim
10$ kpc. Hence such perturbations have widespread influence which peaks in distinct regions of
the disk at different times. This leads us to examine the ongoing MW-Sgr interaction. While Sgr has
not yet crossed the disk (currently, $z_{Sgr} \approx -6$ kpc, $v_{z,Sgr} \approx 210$ km/s), we
demonstrate that the peak of the impact has already passed. Sgr's pull over the past 150 Myr creates
a global $v_z$ signature with amplitude $\propto M_{Sgr}$, which might be detectable in future
spectroscopic surveys.

Context: The discovery of distant trans-Neptunian objects has led to heated discussions about
the structure of the outer Solar System. Aims: We study the dynamical evolution of small bodies from
the Hill regions of migrating giant gaseous clumps that form in the outer solar nebula via gravitational
fragmentation. We attempt to determine whether the observed features of the orbital distribution
of distant trans-Neptunian objects could be caused by this process. Methods: We consider a simple
model that includes the Sun, two point-like giant clumps with masses of ~ 10 Jupiter masses, and a
set of massless objects initially located in the Hill regions of these clumps. We carry out numerical
simulations of the motions of small bodies under gravitational perturbations from two giant clumps
that move in elliptical orbits and approach each other. The orbital distribution of these small
bodies is compared with the observed distribution of distant trans-Neptunian objects. Results:
In addition to the known grouping in longitudes of perihelion, we note new features for observed
distant trans-Neptunian objects. The observed orbital distribution points to the existence of
two groups of distant trans-Neptunian objects with different dynamical characteristics. We show
that the main features of the orbital distribution of distant trans-Neptunian objects can be explained
by their origin in the Hill regions of migrating giant gaseous clumps. Small bodies are ejected from
the Hill regions when the giant clumps move in high-eccentricity orbits and have a close encounter
with each other. Conclusions: The resulting orbital distribution of small bodies in our model and
the observed distribution of distant trans-Neptunian objects have similar features.

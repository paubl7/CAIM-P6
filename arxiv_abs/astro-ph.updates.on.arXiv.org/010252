I study the potential role of young massive (YMCs) and open star clusters (OCs) in assembling stellar-mass
binary black holes (BBHs) which would be detectable as persistent gravitational-wave (GW) sources
by the forthcoming LISA mission. The energetic dynamical interactions inside star clusters make
them factories of assembling BBHs and other types of double-compact binaries that undergo general-relativistic
(GR) inspiral and merger. The initial phase of such inspirals would, typically, sweep through the
LISA GW band. Here, such LISA sources are studied from a set of evolutionary models of star clusters
with masses ranging over $10^4M_\odot-10^5M_\odot$ that represent YMCs and intermediate-aged
OCs in metal-rich and metal-poor environments of the Local Universe. These models are evolved with
long-term, direct, relativistic many-body computations incorporating state-of-the-art stellar-evolutionary
and remnant-formation models. Based on models of Local Universe constructed with such model clusters,
it is shown that YMCs and intermediate-aged OCs would yield several 10s to 100s of LISA BBH sources
at the current cosmic epoch with GW frequency within $10^{-3}{\rm~Hz} - 10^{-1}{\rm~Hz}$ and signal-to-noise-ratio
(S/N) $>5$, assuming a mission lifetime of 5 or 10 years. Such LISA BBHs would have a bimodal distribution
in total mass, be generally eccentric ($\lesssim0.7$), and typically have similar component masses
although mass-asymmetric systems are possible. Intrinsically, there would be 1000s of present-day,
LISA-detectable BBHs from YMCs and OCs. That way, YMCs and OCs would provide a significant and the
dominant contribution to the stellar-mass BBH population detectable by LISA. A small fraction,
$<5$%, of these BBHs would undergo GR inspiral to make it to LIGO-Virgo GW frequency band and merge,
within the mission timespan; $<15$% would do so within twice the timespan.

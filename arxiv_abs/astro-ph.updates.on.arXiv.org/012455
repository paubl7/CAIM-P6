Aims. The main aim of the present analysis is to decipher (i) the small-scale bright features in solar
images of the quiet Sun and active regions obtained with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA) and (ii) the ALMA correspondence of various known chromospheric structures visible
in the H-alpha images of the Sun. Methods. Small-scale ALMA bright features in the quiet Sun region
were analyzed using single-dish ALMA observations (1.21 mm, 248 GHz) and in an active region using
interferometric ALMA measurements (3 mm, 100 GHz). With the single-dish observations, a full-disk
solar image is produced, while interferometric measurements enable the high-resolution reconstruction
of part of the solar disk, including the active region. The selected quiet Sun and active regions
are compared with the H-alpha (core and wing sum), EUV, and soft X-ray images and with the magnetograms.
Results. In the quiet Sun region, enhanced emission seen in the ALMA is almost always associated
with a strong line-of-sight (LOS) magnetic field. Four coronal bright points were identified,
while other small-scale ALMA bright features are most likely associated with magnetic network
elements and plages. In the active region, in 14 small-scale ALMA bright features randomly selected
and compared with other images, we found five good candidates for coronal bright points, two for
plages, and five for fibrils. Two unclear cases remain: a fibril or a jet, and a coronal bright point
or a plage. A comparison of the H-alpha core image and the 3 mm ALMA image of the analyzed active region
showed that the sunspot appears dark in both images (with a local ALMA radiation enhancement in sunspot
umbra), the four plage areas are bright in both images and dark small H-alpha filaments are clearly
recognized as dark structures of the same shape also in ALMA.

Ultra-massive white dwarfs are relevant for their role as type Ia Supernova progenitors, the occurrence
of physical processes in the asymptotic giant-branch phase, the existence of high-field magnetic
white dwarfs, and the occurrence of double white dwarf mergers. Some hydrogen-rich ultra-massive
white dwarfs are pulsating stars, and as such, they offer the possibility of studying their interiors
through asteroseismology. On the other hand, pulsating helium-rich ultra-massive white dwarfs
could be even more attractive objects for asteroseismology if they were found, as they should be
hotter and less crystallized than pulsating hydrogen-rich white dwarfs, something that would
pave the way for probing their deep interiors. We explore the pulsational properties of ultra-massive
helium-rich white dwarfs with carbon-oxygen and oxygen-neon cores resulting from single stellar
evolution. Our goal is to provide a theoretical basis that could eventually help to discern the core
composition of ultra-massive white dwarfs and the scenario of their formation through asteroseismology,
anticipating the possible future detection of pulsations in this type of stars. We find that, given
that the white dwarf models coming from the three scenarios considered are characterized by distinct
core chemical profiles, their pulsation properties are also different, thus leading to distinctive
signatures in the period-spacing and mode-trapping properties. Our results indicate that, in
case of an eventual detection of pulsating ultra-massive helium-rich white dwarfs, it would be
possible to derive valuable information encrypted in the core of these stars in connection with
the origin of such exotic objects. The detection of pulsations in these stars has many chances to
be achieved soon through observations collected with ongoing space missions.

With the Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE), it is now possible to detect spatially extended
Lyman alpha emission from individual faint (M_UV ~ -18) galaxies at redshifts, 3 < z < 6, tracing gas
out to circum-galactic scales comparable to the dark matter halo virial radius. To explore the implications
of such observations, we present a cosmological radiation hydrodynamics simulation of a single
galaxy, chosen to be typical of the Lyman alpha-emitting galaxies detected by MUSE in deep fields.
We use this simulation to study the origin and dynamics of the high-redshift circum-galactic medium
(CGM). We find that the majority of the mass in the diffuse CGM is comprised of material infalling
for the first time towards the halo center, but with the inner CGM also containing a comparable amount
of mass that has moved past first-pericentric passage, and is in the process of settling into a rotationally
supported configuration. Making the connection to Lyman alpha emission, we find that the observed
extended surface brightness profile is due to a combination of three components: scattering of
galactic Lyman alpha emission in the CGM, in-situ emission of CGM gas (mostly infalling), and Lyman
alpha emission from small satellite galaxies. The weight of these contributions vary with distance
from the galaxy such that (1) scattering dominates the inner regions (r < 7 kpc), at surface brightness
larger than a few 10^-19 cgs, (2) all components contribute equally around r ~ 10 kpc (or SB ~10^-19),
and (3) the contribution of small satellite galaxies takes over at large distances (or SB ~10^-20).
Our simulation fails to reproduce the characteristic observed Lyman alpha spectral morphology
that is red-shifted with respect to the systemic velocity, with the implication that the simulation
is missing an important component of neutral outflowing gas.

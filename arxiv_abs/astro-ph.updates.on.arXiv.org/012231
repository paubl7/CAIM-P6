Cosmological probes based on galaxy clusters rely on cluster number counts and large-scale structure
information. X-ray cluster surveys are well suited for this purpose, since they are far less affected
than optical surveys by projection effects, and cluster properties can be predicted with good accuracy.
The XMM Cluster Archive Super Survey, X-CLASS, is a serendipitous search of X-ray-detected galaxy
clusters in 4176 XMM-Newton archival observations until August 2015. All observations are clipped
to exposure times of 10 and 20 ks to obtain uniformity and they span ~269 deg$^2$ across the high-Galactic
latitude sky ($|b|> 20^o$). The main goal of the survey is the compilation of a well-selected cluster
sample suitable for cosmological analyses. We describe the detection algorithm, the visual inspection,
the verification process and the redshift validation of the cluster sample, as well as the cluster
selection function computed by simulations. We also present the various metadata that are released
with the catalogue, along with the redshifts of 124 clusters obtained with a dedicated multi-object
spectroscopic follow-up programme. With this publication we release the new X-CLASS catalogue
of 1646 well-selected X-ray-detected clusters over a wide sky area, along with their selection
function. The sample spans a wide redshift range, from the local Universe up to z~1.5, with 982 spectroscopically
confirmed clusters, and over 70 clusters above z=0.8. Because of its homogeneous selection and
thorough verification, the cluster sample can be used for cosmological analyses, but also as a test-bed
for the upcoming eROSITA observations and other current and future large-area cluster surveys.
It is the first time that such a catalogue is made available to the community via an interactive database
which gives access to a wealth of supplementary information, images, and data.

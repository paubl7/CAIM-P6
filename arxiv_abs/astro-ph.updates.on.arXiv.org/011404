In this work we study a system of two galaxies, Astarte and Adonis, at z $\sim $2 when the Universe was
undergoing its peak of star formation activity. Astarte is a dusty star-forming galaxy at the massive-end
of the main sequence (MS) and Adonis is a less-massive, bright in ultraviolet (UV), companion galaxy
with an optical spectroscopic redshift. We analyse the physical properties of this system, and
probe the gas mass of Astarte with its ALMA CO emission, to investigate whether this ultra-massive
galaxy is quenching or not. We use CIGALE - a spectral energy distribution modeling code - to derive
the key physical properties of Astarte and Adonis, mainly their star formation rates (SFRs), stellar
masses, and dust luminosities. We inspect the variation of the physical parameters depending on
the assumed dust attenuation law. We also estimate the molecular gas mass of Astarte from its CO emission,
using different $\alpha_{CO}$ and transition ratios ($r_{31}$) and discuss the implication of
the various assumptions on the gas mass derivation. We find that Astarte exhibits a MS-like star
formation activity, while Adonis is undergoing a strong starburst (SB) phase. The molecular gas
mass of Astarte is far below the gas fraction of typical star-forming galaxies at z=2. This low gas
content and high SFR, result in a depletion time of $0.22\pm0.07$ Gyrs, slightly shorter than what
is expected for a MS galaxy at this redshift. The CO luminosity versus the total IR luminosity suggests
a MS-like activity assuming a galactic conversion factor and a low transition ratio. The SFR of Astarte
is of the same order using different attenuation laws, unlike its stellar mass that increases using
shallow attenuation laws. We discuss these properties and suggest that Astarte might be experiencing
a recent decrease of star formation activity and is quenching through the MS following a SB epoch.

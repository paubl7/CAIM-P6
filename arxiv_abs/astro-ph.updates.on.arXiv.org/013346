We present a comparative study of the near-infrared (NIR) H$_2$ line emission from five regions
near hot young stars: Sharpless 140, NGC 2023, IC 63, the Horsehead Nebula, and the Orion Bar. This
emission originates in photodissociation or photon-dominated regions (PDRs), interfaces between
photoionized and molecular gas near hot (O) stars or reflection nebulae illuminated by somewhat
cooler (B) stars. In these environments, the dominant excitation mechanism for NIR emission lines
originating from excited rotational-vibrational (rovibrational) levels of the ground electronic
state is radiative or UV excitation (fluorescence), wherein absorption of far-UV photons pumps
H$_2$ molecules into excited electronic states from which they decay into the upper levels of the
NIR lines. Our sources span a range of UV radiation fields ($G_0 = 10^2$-$10^5$) and gas densities
($n_H = 10^4$-$10^6$ cm$^{-3}$), enabling examination of how these properties affect the emergent
spectrum. We obtained high-resolution ($R \approx 45,000$) spectra spanning $1.45$-$2.45$~$\mu$m
on the 2.7m Harlan J. Smith Telescope at McDonald Observatory with the Immersion Grating INfrared
Spectrometer (IGRINS), detecting up to over 170 transitions per source from excited vibrational
states ($v = 1$-$14$). The populations of individual rovibrational levels derived from these data
clearly confirm UV excitation. Among the five PDRs in our survey, the Orion Bar shows the greatest
deviation of the populations and spectrum from pure UV excitation, while Sharpless 140 shows the
least deviation. However, we find that all five PDRs exhibit at least some modification of the level
populations relative to their values under pure UV excitation, a result we attribute to collisional
effects.

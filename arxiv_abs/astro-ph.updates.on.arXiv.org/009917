Since the epoch of cosmic star formation peak at $z \sim 2$, most of it is obscured in high mass galaxies,
while in low mass galaxies the radiation escapes unobstructed. During the reionization epoch,
the presence of evolved, dust obscured galaxies are a challenge to galaxy formation and evolution
models. By means of a chemodynamical evolution model, we investigate the star formation and dust
production required to build up the bulk of dust in galaxies with initial baryonic mass ranging from
$7.5 \times 10^{7}$~M$_\odot$ to $2.0 \times 10^{12}$~M$_\odot$. The star formation efficiency
was also chosen to represent the star formation rate from irregular dwarf to giant elliptical galaxies.
We adopted a dust coagulation efficiency from \citep[][Case A]{dwek1998evolution} as well as
a lower efficiency one (Case B), about five times smaller than Case A. All possible combination of
these parameters was computed, summing forty different scenarios. We find that in high stellar
formation systems the dust accretion in ISM rules over stellar production before the star formation
peak, making these systems almost insensible to dust coagulation efficiency. In low star formation
systems, the difference between Case A and B lasts longer, mainly in small galaxies. Thus, small
irregular galaxies should be the best place to discriminate different dust sources. In our observational
sample, taken from the literature, dust-to-gas ratio tends to be more spread only than dust mass,
for both stellar mass and star formation rate. Dust-to-gas vs. dust-to-star diagram is a good tracer
for both galaxy and dust evolution, due to the link between gas, star, dust and star formation rate.
However, the model do not constrain simultaneously all this quantities. The new generation facilities
(such as JWST, ELT, VLT and SPICA) will be indispensable to constrain dust formation across the cosmic
time.

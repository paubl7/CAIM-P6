An excess of $\gamma$ rays in the data measured by the Fermi Large Area Telescope in the direction
of the Galactic center has been reported in several publications. This excess, labeled as the Galactic
center excess (GCE), is detected analyzing the data with different interstellar emission models,
point source catalogs and analysis techniques. The characteristics of the GCE, recently measured
with unprecedented precision, are all compatible with dark matter particles (DM) annihilating
in the main halo of our Galaxy, even if other interpretations are still not excluded. We investigate
the DM candidates that fit the observed GCE spectrum and spatial morphology. We assume a simple scenario
with DM annihilating into a single channel but we inspect also more complicated models with two and
three channels. We perform a search for a $\gamma$-ray flux from a list of 48 Milky Way dwarf spheroidal
galaxies (dSphs) using state-of-the-art estimation of the DM density in these objects. Since we
do not find any significant signal from the dSphs, we put upper limits on the annihilation cross section
that result to be compatible with the DM candidate that fits the GCE. However, we find that the GCE
DM signal is excluded by the AMS-02 $\bar{p}$ flux data for all hadronic and semi-hadronic annihilation
channels unless the vertical size of the diffusion halo is smaller than 2 kpc -- which is in tension
with radioactive cosmic ray fluxes and radio data. Furthermore, AMS-02 $e^+$ data rule out pure
or mixed channels with a component of $e^+ e^-$. The only DM candidate that fits the GCE spectrum and
is compatible with constraints obtained with the combined dSphs analysis and the AMS-02 $\bar{p}$
and $e^+$ data annihilates purely into $\mu^+\mu^-$, has a mass of 60 GeV and roughly a thermal cross
section.

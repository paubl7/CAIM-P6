We present three-dimensional astrochemical simulations and synthetic observations of magnetised,
turbulent, self-gravitating molecular clouds. We explore various galactic interstellar medium
environments, including cosmic-ray ionization rates in the range of $\zeta_{\rm CR}=10^{-17}$-$10^{-14}\,{\rm
s}^{-1}$, far-UV intensities in the range of $G_0=1$-$10^3$ and metallicities in the range of $Z=0.1$-$2\,{\rm
Z}_{\odot}$. The simulations also probe a range of densities and levels of turbulence, including
cases where the gas has undergone recent compression due to cloud-cloud collisions. We examine:
i) the column densities of carbon species across the cycle of CII, CI and CO, along with OI, in relation
to the HI-to-H$_2$ transition; ii) the velocity-integrated emission of [CII]~$158\mu$m, [$^{13}$CII]~$158\mu$m,
[CI]~$609\mu$m and $370\mu$m, [OI]~$63\mu$m and $146\mu$m, and of the first ten $^{12}$CO rotational
transitions; iii) the corresponding Spectral Line Energy Distributions; iv) the usage of [CII]
and [OI]~$63\mu$m to describe the dynamical state of the clouds; v) the behavior of the most commonly
used ratios between transitions of CO and [CI]; and vi) the conversion factors for using CO and CI
as H$_2$-gas tracers. We find that enhanced cosmic-ray energy densities enhance all aforementioned
line intensities. At low metallicities, the emission of [CII] is well connected with the H$_2$ column,
making it a promising new H$_2$ tracer in metal-poor environments. The conversion factors of $X_{\rm
CO}$ and $X_{\rm CI}$ depend on metallicity and the cosmic-ray ionization rate, but not on FUV intensity.
In the era of ALMA, SOFIA and the forthcoming CCAT-prime telescope, our results can be used to understand
better the behaviour of systems in a wide range of galactic and extragalactic environments.

In this work, we extend our previous study of the bulk viscosity of hot and dense $npe$ matter induced
by the Urca process in the neutrino trapped regime to $npe\mu$ matter by adding the muonic Urca processes
as well as the purely leptonic electroweak processes involving electron-muon transition. The
nuclear matter is modeled in a relativistic density functional approach with two different parametrizations
which predict neutrino dominated matter (DDME2 model) and anti-neutrino dominated matter (NL3
model) at temperatures for which neutrinos/anti-neutrinos are trapped. In the case of neutrino-dominated
matter, the main equilibration mechanism is lepton capture, whereas in the case of antineutrino-dominated
matter this is due to neutron decay. We find that the equilibration rates of Urca processes are higher
than that of the pure leptonic processes, which implies that the Urca bulk viscosity can be computed
with the leptonic reactions assumed to be frozen. We find that the bulk viscosity decreases with
temperature as $\zeta\sim T^{-2}$ at moderate temperatures. At high temperatures this scaling
breaks down by sharp drops of the bulk viscosity close to the temperature where the proton fraction
is density-independent and the matter becomes scale-invariant. This occurs also when the matter
undergoes a transition from the antineutrino-dominated regime to the neutrino-dominated regime
where the bulk viscosity attains a local maximum. We also estimate the bulk viscous dissipation
timescales and find that these are in the range $\gtrsim$ 1 s for temperatures above the neutrino
trapping temperature. These timescales would be relevant only for long-lived objects formed in
binary neutron star mergers and hot proto-neutron stars formed in core-collapse supernovas.

We infer the gravitational potential of the Galactic disk by analysing the phase-space densities
of 120 stellar samples, in 40 spatially separate sub-regions of the solar neighbourhood, using
Gaia's second data release (DR2), in order to quantify spatially dependent systematic effects
that bias this type of measurement. The gravitational potential is inferred under the assumption
of a steady state, in a framework of a Bayesian hierarchical model. We perform a joint fit of our stellar
tracers' three-dimensional velocity distribution, while fully accounting for the astrometric
uncertainties of all stars, dust extinction, and also mask angular areas of known open clusters.
The inferred gravitational potential is compared, post-inference, to the expected potential
coming from the observed baryonic matter and halo dark matter densities. We see an unexpected but
clear trend for all 40 spatially separate sub-regions: while the gravitational potential agrees
well with the expected result at greater distances from the Galactic mid-plane (~400 pc), it is significantly
steeper than expected at lower heights (<60 pc). We see a dependence on Galactic radius that is consistent
with a disk scale length of a few kpc. Apart from this, there are discrepancies between stellar samples,
implying spatially dependent systematic effects which are, at least in part, explained by sub-structures
in the phase-space distributions. The inferred result does not imply a surface density surplus
per se, but rather a total matter density distribution that is highly concentrated to the Galactic
mid-plane, which is inconsistent with the observed distributions of baryons. Our interpretation
is that these results must be biased by a time-varying phase-space structure, possibly a breathing
mode, that is large enough to affect all stellar samples in the same manner.

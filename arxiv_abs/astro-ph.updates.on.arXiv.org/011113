Asteroids orbiting into the highly magnetized and highly relativistic wind of a pulsar offer a favourable
configuration for repeating fast radio bursts (FRB). The body in direct contact with the wind develops
a trail formed of a stationary Alfv\'en wave, called an \textit{Alfv\'en wing}. When an element
of wind crosses the Alfv\'en wing, it sees a rotation of the ambient magnetic field that can cause
radio-wave instabilities. In the observer's reference frame, the waves are collimated in a very
narrow range of directions, and they have an extremely high intensity. A previous work, published
in 2014, showed that planets orbiting a pulsar can cause FRB when they pass in our line of sight. We
predicted periodic FRB. Since then random FRB repeaters have been discovered. We present an upgrade
of this theory where repeaters can be explained by the interaction of smaller bodies with a pulsar
wind. Considering the properties of relativistic Alfv\'en wings attached to a body in the pulsar
wind, and taking thermal consideration into account we conduct a parametric study. We find that
FRBs, including the Lorimer burst (30 Jy), can be explained by small size pulsar companions (1 to
10 km) between 0.03 and 1 AU from a highly magnetized millisecond pulsar. Some sets of parameters
are also compatible with a magnetar. Our model is compatible with the high rotation measure of FRB121102.
The bunched timing of the FRBs is the consequence of a moderate wind turbulence. As asteroid belt
composed of less than 200 bodies would suffice for the FRB occurrence rate measured with FRB121102.
This model, after the present upgrade, is compatible with the properties discovered since its first
publication in 2014, when repeating FRB were still unknown. It is based on standard physics, and
on common astrophysical objects that can be found in any kind of galaxy. It requires $10^{10}$ times
less power than (common) isotropic-emission FRB models.

We utilize the galaxy shape catalogue from the first-year data release of the Subaru Hyper Suprime-cam
Survey (HSC) to study the dark matter content of galaxy groups in the Universe using weak gravitational
lensing. As our lens sample, we use galaxy groups that have been spectroscopically selected from
the Galaxy Mass and Assembly galaxy survey in approximately 100 sq. degrees of the sky that overlap
with the HSC survey. We restrict our analysis to the 1587 groups with at least five group members.
We divide these galaxy groups into six bins each of galaxy group luminosity and group member velocity
dispersion and measure the coherent tangential ellipticity pattern on background HSC galaxies
imprinted by weak gravitational lensing. We measure the weak lensing signal with a signal-to-noise
ratio of 55 and 51 for these two different selections, respectively. We use a Bayesian halo model
framework to infer the halo mass distribution of our galaxy groups binned in the two different observable
properties and obtain constraints on the power-law scaling relation between mean halo masses and
the two group observable properties. We obtain a 5 percent constraint on the amplitude of the scaling
relation between halo mass and group luminosity with $\langle M\rangle = (0.81\pm0.04)\times10^{14}h^{-1}M_\odot$
for $L_{\rm grp}=10^{11.5}h^{-2}L_\odot$, and a power-law index of $\alpha=1.01\pm0.07$. We
also obtain a 5-percent constraint on the amplitude of the scaling relation between halo mass and
velocity dispersion with $\langle M\rangle=(0.93\pm0.05)\times10^{14}h^{-1}M_\odot$ for
$\sigma=500{\,\rm kms}^{-1}$ and a power-law index $\alpha=1.52\pm0.10$, although these scaling
relations are sensitive to the exact cuts applied to the number of group members. Comparisons with
similar scaling relations from the literature indicate that our results are consistent, but have
significantly reduced errors.

The Airborne Infrared Spectrometer (AIR-Spec) was commissioned during the 2017 total solar eclipse,
when it observed five infrared coronal emission lines from the Gulfstream V High-performance Instrumented
Airborne Platform for Environmental Research (GV HIAPER), a research jet owned by the National
Science Foundation (NSF) and operated by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
The second AIR-Spec research flight took place during the July 2, 2019 total solar eclipse across
the south Pacific. The 2019 eclipse flight resulted in seven minutes of observations, during which
the instrument measured all four of its target emission lines: S XI 1.393 $\mu$m, Si X 1.431 $\mu$m,
S XI 1.921 $\mu$m, and Fe IX 2.853 $\mu$m. The 1.393 $\mu$m line, half of a density-sensitive S XI line
pair, was detected for the first time. The 2017 AIR-Spec detection of Fe IX was confirmed and the first
observations were made of the Fe IX intensity as a function of solar radius. Observations of S XI and
Si X were used to estimate the temperature and density above the east and west limbs, the subject of
a future paper. Atmospheric absorption was significant in the 2019 data, and atmospheric modeling
was required to extract accurate line intensities. Telluric absorption features were used to calibrate
the wavelength mapping, instrumental broadening, and throughput of the instrument. AIR-Spec
underwent significant upgrades in preparation for the 2019 eclipse flight. The thermal background
was reduced by a factor of 30, providing a 5.5x improvement in signal-to-noise ratio, and the pointing
stability was improved by a factor of five to $<$10 arcsec RMS after image co-alignment. In addition,
two imaging artifacts were identified and resolved, making the 2019 data easier to interpret and
improving the spectral resolution by up to 50%.

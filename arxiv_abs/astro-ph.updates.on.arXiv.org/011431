The analysis of the APOGEE DR16 data suggests the existence of a clear distinction between two sequences
of disc stars at different Galactocentric distances in the [$\alpha$/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] abundance
ratio space: the so-called high-$\alpha$ sequence, classically associated to an old population
of stars in the thick disc, and the low-$\alpha$ sequence, which mostly comprises relatively young
stars in the thin disc. We perform a Bayesian analysis based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method to
constrain a multi-zone two-infall chemical evolution model designed for regions at different
Galactocentric distances using measured chemical abundances from the APOGEE DR16 sample. An inside-out
formation of the Galaxy disc naturally emerges from the best fit of our two-infall chemical-evolution
model to APOGEE-DR16: inner Galactic regions are assembled on shorter time-scales compared to
the external ones. In the outer disc (with radii $R>6$ kpc), the chemical dilution due to a late accretion
event of gas with primordial chemical composition is the main driver of the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] abundance
pattern in the low-$\alpha$ sequence. In the inner disc, in the framework of the two-infall model,
we confirm the presence of an enriched gas infall in the low-$\alpha$ phase as suggested by chemo-dynamical
models. Our Bayesian analysis of the recent APOGEE DR16 data suggests a significant delay time,
ranging from $\sim$3.0 to 4.7 Gyr, between the first and second gas infall events for all the analyzed
Galactocentric regions. Our results propose a clear interpretation of the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relations
along the Galactic discs. The signatures of a delayed gas-rich merger which gives rise to a hiatus
in the star formation history of the Galaxy are impressed in the [Mg/Fe] vs. [Fe/H] relation, determining
how the low-$\alpha$ stars are distributed in the abundance space at different Galactocentric
distances.

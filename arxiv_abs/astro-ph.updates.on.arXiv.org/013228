We present new measurements of rest-UV luminosity functions and angular correlation functions
from 4,100,221 galaxies at z~2-7 identified in the Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam survey and CFHT Large-Area
U-band Survey. The obtained luminosity functions at z~4-7 cover a very wide UV luminosity range
of ~0.002-2000L*uv combined with previous studies, revealing that the dropout luminosity function
is a superposition of the AGN luminosity function dominant at Muv<-24 mag and the galaxy luminosity
function dominant at Muv>-22 mag, consistent with galaxy fractions based on 1037 spectroscopically-identified
sources. Galaxy luminosity functions estimated from the spectroscopic galaxy fractions show
the bright end excess beyond the Schechter function at >2sigma levels, which is possibly made by
inefficient mass quenching, low dust obscuration, and/or hidden AGN activity. By analyzing the
correlation functions at z~2-6 with halo occupation distribution models, we find a weak redshift
evolution (within 0.3 dex) of the ratio of the star formation rate (SFR) to the dark matter accretion
rate, SFR/(dMh/dt), indicating the almost constant star formation efficiency at z~2-6, as suggested
by our earlier work at z~4-7. Meanwhile, the ratio gradually increases with decreasing redshift
at z<5 within 0.3 dex, which quantitatively reproduces the redshift evolution of the cosmic SFR
density, suggesting that the evolution is primarily driven by the increase of the halo number density
due to the structure formation, and the decrease of the accretion rate due to the cosmic expansion.
Extrapolating this calculation to higher redshifts assuming the constant efficiency suggests
a rapid decrease of the SFR density at z>10 with $\rho_\mathrm{SFR}\propto10^{-0.5(1+z)}$, which
will be directly tested with JWST.

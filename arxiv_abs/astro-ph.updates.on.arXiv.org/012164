Many stars are in binaries or higher-order multiple stellar systems. Although in recent years a
large number of binaries have been proven to host exoplanets, how planet formation proceeds in multiple
stellar systems has not been studied much yet from the theoretical standpoint. In this paper we focus
on the evolution of the dust grains in planet-forming discs in binaries. We take into account the
dynamics of gas and dust in discs around each component of a binary system under the hypothesis that
the evolution of the circumprimary and the circumsecondary discs is independent. It is known from
previous studies that the secular evolution of the gas in binary discs is hastened due to the tidal
interactions with their hosting stars. Here we prove that binarity affects dust dynamics too, possibly
in a more dramatic way than the gas. In particular, the presence of a stellar companion significantly
reduces the amount of solids retained in binary discs because of a faster, more efficient radial
drift, ultimately shortening their lifetime. We prove that how rapidly discs disperse depends
both on the binary separation, with discs in wider binaries living longer, and on the disc viscosity.
Although the less-viscous discs lose high amounts of solids in the earliest stages of their evolution,
they are dissipated slowly, while those with higher viscosities show an opposite behaviour. The
faster radial migration of dust in binary discs has a striking impact on planet formation, which
seems to be inhibited in this hostile environment, unless other disc substructures halt radial
drift further in. We conclude that if planetesimal formation were viable in binary discs, this process
would take place on very short time scales.

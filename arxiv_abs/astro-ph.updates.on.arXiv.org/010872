CONTEXT. Many massive stars have nearby companions whose presence hamper their characterization
through spectroscopy. AIMS. We want to continue obtaining spatially resolved spectroscopy of
close massive visual binaries to derive their spectral types. METHODS. We have used lucky spectroscopy
to obtain many short long-slit spectroscopic exposures of 19 close visual binaries under good seeing
conditions. We selected those with the best characteristics, extracted the spectra using multiple-profile
fitting, and combined the results to derive spatially separated spectra. The results are analyzed
in combination with data from lucky imaging, regular intermediate-resolution single-order spectroscopy,
and \'echelle high-resolution spectroscopy. RESULTS. The new application of lucky spectroscopy
has allowed us to [a] spatially disentangle for the first time two O stars (FN CMa B and 6 Cas B) with
brighter BA supergiant companions; [b] determine that two B stars (alpha Sco B and HD 164492 B) with
close and more massive companions are fast rotators; [c] extend the technique to cases with extreme
magnitude differences, shorter separations, and fainter primary magnitudes down to B=11; [d]
spatially disentangle the spectra of stars with companions as diverse as an A supergiant (6 Cas A),
a WR star (WR 157), and an M supergiant (alpha Sco A); [e] discover the unexpected identity of some
targets such as two previously unknown bright O stars (HD 51756 B and BD +60 544) and a new member of
the rare OC category (HD 8768 A); and [f] identify and classify which of the components of four visual
binaries is a double-lined spectroscopic binary and for another seven systems detect signs of spectroscopic
binarity using high-spectral-resolution spectroscopy. We also present a determination of the
limits of the technique. [ABRIDGED]

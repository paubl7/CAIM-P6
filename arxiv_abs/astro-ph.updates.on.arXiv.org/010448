Type Ic supernovae represent the explosions of the most stripped massive stars, but their progenitors
and explosion mechanisms remain unclear. Larger samples of observed supernovae can help characterize
the population of these transients. We present an analysis of 44 spectroscopically normal Type
Ic supernovae, with focus on the light curves. The photometric data were obtained over 7 years with
the Palomar Transient Factory (PTF) and its continuation, the intermediate Palomar Transient
Factory (iPTF). This is the first homogeneous and large sample of SNe Ic from an untargeted survey,
and we aim to estimate explosion parameters for the sample. We present K-corrected Bgriz light curves
of these SNe, obtained through photometry on template-subtracted images. We performed an analysis
on the shape of the $r$-band light curves and confirmed the correlation between the rise parameter
Delta m_{-10} and the decline parameter Delta m_{15}. Peak r-band absolute magnitudes have an average
of -17.71 +- 0.85 mag. To derive the explosion epochs, we fit the r-band lightcurves to a template
derived from a well-sampled light curve. We computed the bolometric light curves using r and g band
data, g-r colors and bolometric corrections. Bolometric light curves and Fe II lambda 5169 velocities
at peak were used to fit to the Arnett semianalytic model in order to estimate the ejecta mass M_{ej},
the explosion energy E_{K} and the mass of radioactive nickel (M(56) Ni) for each SN. Including 41
SNe, we find average values of <M_{ej}>=4.50 +-0.79 msun, <E_{K}>=1.79 +- 0.29 x10^{51} erg, and
<M(56)Ni)>= 0.19 +- 0.03 msun. The explosion-parameter distributions are comparable to those
available in the literature, but our large sample also includes some transients with narrow and
very broad light curves leading to more extreme ejecta masses values.

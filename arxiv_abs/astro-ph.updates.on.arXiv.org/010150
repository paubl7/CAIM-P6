Quasar broad emission lines are largely powered by photoionization from the accretion continuum.
Increased central luminosity will enhance line emissivity in more distant clouds, leading to increased
average distance of the broad-line-emitting clouds and decreased averaged line width, known as
the broad-line region (BLR) "breathing". However, different lines breathe differently, and some
high-ionization lines, such as C IV, can even show "anti-breathing" where the line broadens when
luminosity increases. Using multi-year photometric and spectroscopic monitoring data from the
Sloan Digital Sky Survey Reverberation Mapping project, we quantify the breathing effect ($\Delta$log
W=$\alpha\Delta$log L) of broad H$\alpha$, H$\beta$, Mg II, C IV, and C III] for statistical quasar
samples over $z\approx 0.1-2.5$. We found that H$\beta$ displays the most consistent normal breathing
expected from the virial relation ($\alpha\sim-0.25$), Mg II and H$\alpha$ on average show no breathing
($\alpha\sim 0$), and C IV (and similarly C III] and Si IV mostly shows anti-breathing ($\alpha>0$).
The anti-breathing of C IV can be well understood by the presence of a non-varying core component
in addition to a reverberating broad-base component, consistent with earlier findings. The deviation
from canonical breathing introduces extra scatter (a luminosity-dependent bias) in single-epoch
virial BH mass estimates due to intrinsic quasar variability, which underlies the long argued caveats
of C IV single-epoch masses. Using the line dispersion instead of FWHM leads to less, albeit still
substantial, deviations from canonical breathing in most cases. Our results strengthen the need
for reverberation mapping to provide reliable quasar BH masses, and quantify the level of variability-induced
bias in single-epoch BH masses based on various lines.

In an effort to improve our understanding of the spiral arm structure of the Milky Way, we use Classical
Cepheids (CCs) to increase the number of young tracers on the far side of the Galactic disk with accurately
determined distances. We use a sample of 30 CCs, discovered using near-infrared photometry from
the VISTA Variables in the V\'ia L\'actea survey (VVV) and classified based on their radial velocities
and metallicities. We combine them with another 20 CCs from the literature for which VVV photometry
is available. The compiled sample of CCs with homogeneously computed distances based on VVV infrared
photometry was employed as a proof of concept to trace the spiral structure in the poorly explored
far side of the disk. Although the use of CCs has some caveats, these variables are currently the only
available young tracers in the far side disk for which a numerous sample with accurate distances
can be obtained. Therefore, a larger sample could allow us to make a significant step forward in our
understanding of the Milky Way disk as a whole. We present preliminary evidence that CCs favor: a
spiral arm model with two main arms (Perseus and Scutum-Centaurus) branching out into four arms
at galactocentric distances, $R_\mathrm {GC}\gtrsim5-6\,\mathrm{kpc}$; the extension of the
Scutum-Centaurus arm behind the Galactic center; a possible connection between the Perseus arm
and the Norma tangency direction. The current sample of CCs in the far side of the Galaxy are in the
mid-plane, arguing against the presence of a severely warped disk at small Galactocentric distances
($R_\mathrm {GC}\lesssim12\,\mathrm{kpc}$) in the studied area. The discovery and characterization
of CCs at near-IR wavelengths appears to be a promising tool to complement studies based on other
spiral arm tracers and extend them to the far side of our Galaxy.

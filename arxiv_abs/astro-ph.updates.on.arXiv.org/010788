Assuming that a scalar field controls the inflationary era, we examine the combined effects of string
and $f(R)$ gravity corrections on the inflationary dynamics of canonical scalar field inflation,
imposing the constraint that the speed of the primordial gravitational waves is equal to that of
light's. Particularly, we study the inflationary dynamics of an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity
in the presence of $\alpha R^2$ corrections, where $\alpha$ is a free coupling parameter. As it was
the case in the pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity, the realization that the gravitational waves
propagate through spacetime with the velocity of light, imposes the constraint that the Gauss-Bonnet
coupling function $\xi(\phi)$ obeys the differential equation $\ddot\xi=H\dot\xi$, where $H$
is the Hubble rate. Subsequently, a relation for the time derivative of the scalar field is extracted
which implies that the scalar functions of the model, which are the Gauss-Bonnet coupling and the
scalar potential, are interconnected and simply designating one of them specifies the other immediately.
In this framework, it is useful to freely designate $\xi(\phi)$ and extract the corresponding scalar
potential from the equations of motion but the opposite is still feasible. We demonstrate that the
model can produce a viable inflationary phenomenology and for a wide range of the free parameters.
Also, a mentionable issue is that when the coupling parameter $\alpha$ of the $R^2$ correction term
is $\alpha<10^{-3}$ in Planck Units, the $R^2$ term is practically negligible and one obtains the
same equations of motion as in the pure Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory, however the dynamics still
change, since now the time derivative of $\frac{\partial f}{\partial R}$ is nonzero.

Upcoming measurements of the small-scale primary cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature
and polarization power spectra ($TT$/$TE$/$EE$) are anticipated to yield transformative constraints
on new physics, including the effective number of relativistic species in the early universe ($N_{\rm
eff}$). However, at multipoles $\ell \gtrsim 3000$, the primary CMB power spectra receive significant
contributions from gravitational lensing. While these modes still carry primordial information,
their theoretical modeling requires knowledge of the CMB lensing convergence power spectrum,
$C_L^{\kappa\kappa}$, including on small scales where it is affected by nonlinear gravitational
evolution and baryonic feedback processes. Thus, the high-$\ell$ primary CMB is sensitive to these
late-time, nonlinear effects. Here, we show that inaccuracies in the modeling of $C_L^{\kappa\kappa}$
can yield surprisingly large biases on cosmological parameters inferred from the primary CMB power
spectra measured by the upcoming Simons Observatory and CMB-S4 experiments. For CMB-S4, the biases
can be as large as $1.6\sigma$ on the Hubble constant $H_0$ in a fit to $\Lambda$CDM and $1.2\sigma$
on $N_{\rm eff}$ in a fit to $\Lambda$CDM+$N_{\rm eff}$. We show that these biases can be mitigated
by explicitly discarding all $TT$ data at $\ell>3000$ or by marginalizing over parameters describing
baryonic feedback processes, both at the cost of slightly larger error bars. We also discuss an alternative,
data-driven mitigation strategy based on delensing the CMB $T$ and $E$-mode maps. Finally, we show
that analyses of upcoming data will require Einstein-Boltzmann codes to be run with much higher
numerical precision settings than is currently standard, so as to avoid similar -- or larger -- parameter
biases due to inaccurate theoretical predictions.

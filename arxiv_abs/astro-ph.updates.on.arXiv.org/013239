LBVs are massive evolved stars that suffer sporadic and violent mass-loss events. They have been
proposed as the progenitors of some core-collapse SNe, but this idea is still debated due to the lack
of direct evidence. Since SNRs can carry in their morphology the fingerprints of the progenitor
stars as well as of the inhomogeneous CSM sculpted by the progenitors, the study of SNRs from LBVs
could help to place core-collapse SNe in context with the evolution of massive stars. We investigate
the physical, chemical and morphological properties of the remnants of SNe originating from LBVs,
in order to search for signatures, revealing the nature of the progenitors, in the ejecta distribution
and morphology of the remnants. As a template of LBVs, we considered the actual LBV candidate Gal
026.47+0.02. We selected a grid of models, which describe the evolution of a massive star with properties
consistent with those of Gal 026.47+0.02 and its final fate as core-collapse SN. We developed a 3D
HD model that follows the post-explosion evolution of the ejecta from the breakout of the shock wave
at the stellar surface to the interaction of the SNR with a CSM characterized by two dense nested toroidal
shells, parametrized in agreement with multi-wavelength observations of Gal 026.47+0.02. Our
models show a strong interaction of the blast wave with the CSM which determines an important slowdown
of the expansion of the ejecta in the equatorial plane where the two shells lay, determining a high
degree of asymmetry in the remnant. After 10000 years of evolution the ejecta show an elongated shape
forming a broad jet-like structure caused by the interaction with the shells and oriented along
the axis of the toroidal shells.

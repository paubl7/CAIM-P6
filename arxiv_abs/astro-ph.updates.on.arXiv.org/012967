Observations of the redshifted 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen (HI) are a new and powerful window
of observation that offers us the possibility to map the spatial distribution of cosmic HI and learn
about cosmology. BINGO (Baryon Acoustic Oscillations [BAO] from Integrated Neutral Gas Observations)
is a new unique radio telescope designed to be one of the first to probe BAO at radio frequencies. BINGO
has two science goals: cosmology and astrophysics. Cosmology is the main science goal and the driver
for BINGO's design and strategy. The key of BINGO is to detect the low redshift BAO to put strong constraints
in the dark sector models. Given the versatility of the BINGO telescope, a secondary goal is astrophysics,
where BINGO can help discover and study Fast Radio Bursts (FRB) and other transients, Galactic and
extragalactic science. In this paper, we introduce the latest progress of the BINGO project, its
science goals, describing the scientific potential of the project in each science and the new developments
obtained by the collaboration. We introduce the BINGO project and its science goals and give a general
summary of recent developments in construction, science potential and pipeline development obtained
by the BINGO collaboration in the past few years. We show that BINGO will be able to obtain competitive
constraints for the dark sector, and also that will allow for the discovery of several FRBs in the
southern hemisphere. The capacity of BINGO in obtaining information from 21-cm is also tested in
the pipeline introduced here. There is still no measurement of the BAO in radio, and studying cosmology
in this new window of observations is one of the most promising advances in the field. The BINGO project
is a radio telescope that has the goal to be one of the first to perform this measurement and it is currently
being built in the northeast of Brazil. (Abridged)

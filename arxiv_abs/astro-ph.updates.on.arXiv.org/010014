(Abridged) Type I superluminous supernovae (SLSNe I) are rare, powerful explosions whose mechanism
and progenitors remain elusive. SLSNe I show a preference for low-metallicity, actively star-forming
dwarf galaxies. We investigate whether the hosts of SLSNe I show increased evidence for interaction.
We use a sample of 42 SLSN I images obtained with $\textit{HST}$ and measure the number of companion
galaxies by counting the objects detected within a given radius from the host. As a comparison, we
used two Monte Carlo-based methods to estimate the expected average number of companion objects
in the same images, as well as a sample of 32 galaxies that have hosted long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs).
About 50% of SLSN I hosts have at least one major companion (within a flux ratio of 1:4) within 5 kpc.
The average number of major companions per SLSN I host galaxy is $0.70^{+0.19}_{-0.14}$. Our Monte
Carlo comparison methods yield a lower number of companions for random objects of similar brightness
in the same image or for the SLSN host after randomly redistributing the sources in the same image.
The Anderson-Darling test shows that this difference is statistically significant independent
of the redshift range. The same is true for the projected distance distribution of the companions.
The SLSN I hosts are, thus, found in areas of their images, where the object number density is greater
than average. SLSN I hosts have more companions than GRB hosts ($0.44^{+0.25}_{-0.13}$ companions
per host distributed over 25% of the hosts) but the difference is not statistically significant.
The difference between their separations is, however, marginally significant. The dwarf galaxies
hosting SLSNe I are often part of interacting systems. This suggests that SLSNe I progenitors are
formed after a recent burst of star formation. Low metallicity alone cannot explain this tendency.

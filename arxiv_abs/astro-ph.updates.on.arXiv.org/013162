Molecular kinetic simulations are typically used to accurately describe the tenuous regions of
the upper atmospheres on planetary bodies. These simulations track the motion of particles representing
real atmospheric atoms and/or molecules subject to collisions, the object's gravity, and external
influences. Because particles can end up in very large ballistic orbits, upper boundary conditions
(UBC) are typically used to limit the domain size thereby reducing the time for the atmosphere to
reach steady-state. In the absence of a clear altitude at which all molecules are removed, such as
a Hill sphere, an often used condition is to choose an altitude at which collisions become infrequent
so that particles on escape trajectories are removed. The remainder are then either specularly
reflected back into the simulation domain or their ballistic trajectories are calculated analytically
or explicitly tracked so they eventually re-enter the domain. Here we examine the effect of the choice
of the UBC on the escape rate and the structure of the atmosphere near the nominal exobase in the convenient
and frequently used 1D spherically symmetric approximation. Using Callisto as the example body,
we show that the commonly used specular reflection UBC can lead to significant uncertainties when
simulating a species with a lifetime comparable to or longer than a dynamical time scale, such as
an overestimation of escape rates and an inflated exosphere. Therefore, although specular reflection
is convenient, the molecular lifetimes and body's dynamical time scales need to be considered even
when implementing the convenient 1D spherically symmetric simulations in order to accurately
estimate the escape rate and the density and temperature structure in the transition regime.

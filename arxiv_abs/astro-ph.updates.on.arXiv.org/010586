The past few decades have seen the burgeoning of wide field, high cadence surveys, the most formidable
of which will be the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST) to be conducted by the Vera C. Rubin Observatory.
So new is the field of systematic time-domain survey astronomy, however, that major scientific
insights will continue to be obtained using smaller, more flexible systems than the LSST. One such
example is the Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer (GOTO), whose primary science objective
is the optical follow-up of Gravitational Wave events. The amount and rate of data production by
GOTO and other wide-area, high-cadence surveys presents a significant challenge to data processing
pipelines which need to operate in near real-time to fully exploit the time-domain. In this study,
we adapt the Rubin Observatory LSST Science Pipelines to process GOTO data, thereby exploring the
feasibility of using this "off-the-shelf" pipeline to process data from other wide-area, high-cadence
surveys. In this paper, we describe how we use the LSST Science Pipelines to process raw GOTO frames
to ultimately produce calibrated coadded images and photometric source catalogues. After comparing
the measured astrometry and photometry to those of matched sources from PanSTARRS DR1, we find that
measured source positions are typically accurate to sub-pixel levels, and that measured L-band
photometries are accurate to $\sim50$ mmag at $m_L\sim16$ and $\sim200$ mmag at $m_L\sim18$. These
values compare favourably to those obtained using GOTO's primary, in-house pipeline, GOTOPHOTO,
in spite of both pipelines having undergone further development and improvement beyond the implementations
used in this study. Finally, we release a generic "obs package" that others can build-upon should
they wish to use the LSST Science Pipelines to process data from other facilities.

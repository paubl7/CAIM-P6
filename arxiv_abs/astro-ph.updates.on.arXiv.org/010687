We present abundances of 21 elements in a sample of 13 bright FG dwarfs drawn from the Kepler LEGACY
sample to examine the applicability of the abundance-age relations to stars with properties strongly
departing from solar. These stars have precise asteroseismic ages that can be compared to the abundance-based
estimates. We analyse the well-known binary 16 Cyg AB for validation purposes and confirm the existence
of a slight metal enhancement (~0.02 dex) in the primary, which might arise from planetary formation/ingestion.
We draw attention to systematic errors in some widely-used catalogues of non-seismic parameters
that may significantly bias asteroseismic inferences. In particular, we find evidence that the
ASPCAP Teff scale used for the APOKASC catalogue is too cool for dwarfs and that the [Fe/H] values
are underestimated by ~0.1 dex. We compare seismic ages to those inferred from empirical abundance-age
relations based on ages from PARSEC isochrones and abundances obtained in the framework of the HARPS-GTO
program. These calibrations take into account a dependency with the stellar effective temperature,
metallicity, and/or mass. We find that the seismic and abundance-based ages differ on average by
1.5-2 Gyrs, while taking into account a dependency with one or two stellar parameters in the calibrations
leads to a global improvement of up to ~0.5 Gyr. However, even in that case we find that seismic ages
are systematically larger by ~0.7 Gyr. We argue that it may be ascribed to a variety of causes including
the presence of small zero-point offsets between our abundances and those used to construct the
calibrations or to the choice of the set of theoretical isochrones. The conclusions above are supported
by the analysis of literature data for a larger number of Kepler targets. [Abridged]

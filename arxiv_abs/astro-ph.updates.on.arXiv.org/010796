We announce the second data release (DR2) of the NOIRLab Source Catalog (NSC), using 412,116 public
images from CTIO-4m+DECam, the KPNO-4m+Mosaic3 and the Bok-2.3m+90Prime. NSC DR2 contains over
3.9 billion unique objects, 68 billion individual source measurements, covers $\approx$35,000
square degrees of the sky, has depths of $\approx$23rd magnitude in most broadband filters with
$\approx$1-2% photometric precision, and astrometric accuracy of $\approx$7 mas. Approximately
1.9 billion objects within $\approx$30,000 square degrees of sky have photometry in three or more
bands. There are several improvements over NSC DR1. DR2 includes 156,662 (61%) more exposures extending
over 2 more years than in DR1. The southern photometric zeropoints in $griz$ are more accurate by
using the Skymapper DR1 and ATLAS-Ref2 catalogs, and improved extinction corrections were used
for high-extinction regions. In addition, the astrometric accuracy is improved by taking advantage
of Gaia DR2 proper motions when calibrating the WCS of individual images. This improves the NSC proper
motions to $\sim$2.5 mas/yr (precision) and $\sim$0.2 mas/yr (accuracy). The combination of sources
into unique objects is performed using a DBSCAN algorithm and mean parameters per object (such as
mean magnitudes, proper motion, etc.) are calculated more robustly with outlier rejection. Finally,
eight multi-band photometric variability indices are calculated for each object and variable
objects are flagged (23 million objects). NSC DR2 will be useful for exploring solar system objects,
stellar streams, dwarf satellite galaxies, QSOs, variable stars, high-proper motion stars, and
transients. Several examples of these science use cases are presented. The NSC DR2 catalog is publicly
available via the NOIRLab's Astro Data Lab science platform.

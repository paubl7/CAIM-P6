Solar Orbiter is the first space mission observing the solar plasma both in situ and remotely, from
a close distance, in and out of the ecliptic. The ultimate goal is to understand how the Sun produces
and controls the heliosphere, filling the Solar System and driving the planetary environments.
With six remote-sensing and four in-situ instrument suites, the coordination and planning of the
operations are essential to address the following four top-level science questions: (1) What drives
the solar wind and where does the coronal magnetic field originate? (2) How do solar transients drive
heliospheric variability? (3) How do solar eruptions produce energetic particle radiation that
fills the heliosphere? (4) How does the solar dynamo work and drive connections between the Sun and
the heliosphere? Maximising the mission's science return requires considering the characteristics
of each orbit, including the relative position of the spacecraft to Earth (affecting downlink rates),
trajectory events (such as gravitational assist manoeuvres), and the phase of the solar activity
cycle. Furthermore, since each orbit's science telemetry will be downloaded over the course of
the following orbit, science operations must be planned at mission level, rather than at the level
of individual orbits. It is important to explore the way in which those science questions are translated
into an actual plan of observations that fits into the mission, thus ensuring that no opportunities
are missed. First, the overarching goals are broken down into specific, answerable questions along
with the required observations and the so-called Science Activity Plan (SAP) is developed to achieve
this. The SAP groups objectives that require similar observations into Solar Orbiter Observing
Plans (SOOPs), resulting in a strategic, top-level view of the optimal opportunities for science
observations during the mission lifetime.

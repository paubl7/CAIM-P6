We constrain cosmological parameters from a joint cosmic shear analysis of peak-counts and the
two-point shear correlation functions, as measured from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y1). We find
the structure growth parameter $S_8\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.766^{+0.033}_{-0.038}$,
which at 4.8% precision, provides one of the tightest constraints on $S_8$ from the DES-Y1 weak lensing
data. In our simulation-based method we determine the expected DES-Y1 peak-count signal for a range
of cosmologies sampled in four $w$CDM parameters ($\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_8$, $h$, $w_0$).
We also determine the joint covariance matrix with over 1000 realisations at our fiducial cosmology.
With mock DES-Y1 data we calibrate the impact of photometric redshift and shear calibration uncertainty
on the peak-count, marginalising over these uncertainties in our cosmological analysis. Using
dedicated training samples we show that our measurements are unaffected by mass resolution limits
in the simulation, and that our constraints are robust against uncertainty in the effect of baryon
feedback. Accurate modelling for the impact of intrinsic alignments on the tomographic peak-count
remains a challenge, currently limiting our exploitation of cross-correlated peak counts between
high and low redshift bins. We demonstrate that once calibrated, a fully tomographic joint peak-count
and correlation functions analysis has the potential to reach a 3% precision on $S_8$ for DES-Y1.
Our methodology can be adopted to model any statistic that is sensitive to the non-Gaussian information
encoded in the shear field. In order to accelerate the development of these beyond-two-point cosmic
shear studies, our simulations are made available to the community upon request.

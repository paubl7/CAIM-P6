Recent studies have shown that the radii and masses of adjacent planets within a planetary system
are correlated. It is unknown how this 'peas-in-a-pod' phenomenon originates, whether it is in
place at birth or requires evolution, and whether it (initially) applies only to neighboring planets
or to all planets within a system. Here we address these questions by making use of the recent discovery
that planetary system architectures strongly depend on ambient stellar clustering. Based on Gaia's
second data release, we divide the sample of planetary systems hosting multiple planets into those
residing in stellar position-velocity phase space overdensities and the field, representing
samples with elevated and low degrees of external perturbation, respectively. We demonstrate
that the peas-in-a-pod phenomenon manifests itself in both samples, suggesting that the uniformity
of planetary properties within a system is not restricted to direct neighbors and likely already
exists at birth. The radius uniformity is significantly elevated in overdensities, suggesting
that it can be enhanced by evolutionary effects that either have a similar impact on the entire planetary
system or favour the retention of similar planets. The mass uniformity may exhibit a similar, but
weaker dependence. Finally, we find ordering in both samples, with the planet radius and mass increasing
outwards. Despite its prevalence, the ordering is somewhat weaker in overdensities, suggesting
that it may be disrupted by external perturbations arising from stellar clustering. We conclude
that a comprehensive understanding of the 'peas-in-a-pod' phenomenon requires linking planet
formation and evolution to the large-scale stellar and galactic environment.

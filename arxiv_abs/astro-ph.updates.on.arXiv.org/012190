Reflected starlight measurements will open a new path in the characterization of directly imaged
exoplanets. However, we still lack a population study of known targets amenable to this technique.
Here, we investigate which of the about 4300 exoplanets confirmed to date are accessible to the Roman
Space Telescope's coronagraph (CGI) in reflected starlight at reference wavelengths $\lambda$=575,
730 and 825 nm. We carry out a population study and also address the prospects for phase-curve measurements.
We used the NASA Exoplanet Archive as a reference for planet and star properties, and explored the
impact of their uncertainties on the exoplanet's detectability by applying statistical arguments.
We define a planet as Roman-accessible on the basis of the instrument inner and outer working angles
and its minimum planet-to-star constrast (IWA, OWA, $C_{min}$). We adopt for these technical specifications
three plausible configurations labeled as pessimistic, intermediate and optimistic. Our key
outputs for each exoplanet are its probability of being Roman-accessible ($P_{access}$), the
range of observable phase angles, the evolution of its equilibrium temperature, the number of days
per orbit that it is accessible and its transit probability. In the optimistic scenario, we find
26 Roman-accessible exoplanets with $P_{access}$>25% and host stars brighter than $V$=7 mag.
This population is biased towards planets more massive than Jupiter but also includes the super-Earths
tau Cet e and f which orbit near their star's habitable zone. A total of 13 planets are part of multiplanet
systems, 3 of them with known transiting companions, offering opportunities for contemporaneous
characterization. The intermediate and pessimistic scenarios yield 10 and 3 Roman-accessible
exoplanets, respectively. We find that inclination estimates (e.g. with astrometry) are key for
refining the detectability prospects.

Context. We study two coronal mass ejections (CMEs) observed between April 1-2, 2019 by both the
inner Wide-Field Imager for Parker Solar Probe (WISPR-I) and the inner heliospheric imager (HI-1)
on board STEREO-A. This is the first study of CME observations from two viewpoints in similar directions
but at considerably different solar distances. Aims. Our objective is to understand how the PSP
observations affect the CME kinematics, especially due to its proximity to the Sun. Methods. We
estimate the CME positions, speeds, accelerations, propagation directions and longitudinal
deflections using imaging observations from two spacecraft, and a set of analytical expressions
that consider the CME as a point structure and take into account the rapid change in spacecraft position.
Results. We find that both CMEs are slow ($< 400\ km\ s^{-1}$), propagating eastward of the Sun-Earth
line. The second CME seems to accelerate between $\sim 0.1$ to $\sim 0.2\ au$ and deflect westward
with an angular speed consistent with the solar rotation speed. We find some discrepancies in the
CME solar distance (up to $0.05\ au$, particularly for CME \#1), latitude (up to $\sim10^{\circ}$)
and longitude (up to $24^{\circ}$) when comparing results from different fit cases (different
observations or set of free parameters). Conclusions. Discrepancies in longitude are likely due
to the feature tracked visually rather than instrumental biases or fit assumptions. For similar
reasons, the CME \#1 solar distance, as derived from WISPR-I observations, is larger than the HI-1
result, regardless of the fit parameters considered. Error estimates for CME kinematics do not
show any clear trend associated to the observing instrument. The source region location and the
lack of any clear in situ counterparts (both at near-Earth and at PSP) support our estimate of the
propagation direction for both events.

(Abridged) In this paper, we present analyses of images taken with the Herschel ESA satellite from
70mu to 500mu. We first constructed column density and dust temperature maps. Next, we identified
compact cores in the maps, and characterize the cores using modified blackbody fits to their SEDs:
we identified 684 starless cores, of which 199 are bound and potential prestellar cores, and 132
protostars. We also matched the Herschel-identified young stars with GAIA sources to model distance
variations across the Perseus cloud. We measure a linear gradient function with right ascension
and declination for the entire cloud. From the SED fits, mass and temperature of cores were derived.
The core mass function can be modelled with a log-normal distribution that peaks at 0.82~$M_\sun$
suggesting a star formation efficiency of 0.30. The high-mass tail can be modelled with a power law
of slope $\sim-2.32$, close to the Salpeter's value. We also identify the filamentary structure
of Perseus, confirming that stars form preferentially in filaments. We find that the majority of
filaments where star formation is ongoing are transcritical against their own internal gravity
because their linear masses are below the critical limit of 16~$M_\sun$pc$^{-1}$ above which we
expect filaments to collapse. We find a possible explanation for this result, showing that a filament
with a linear mass as low as 8~$M_\sun$pc$^{-1}$ can be already unstable. We confirm a linear relation
between star formation efficiency and slope of dust probability density function and a similar
relation is also seen with the core formation efficiency. We derive a lifetime for the prestellar
core phase of $1.69\pm0.52$~Myr for Perseus but different regions have a wide range in prestellar
core fractions, hint that star-formation has started only recently in some clumps. We also derive
a free-fall time for prestellar cores of 0.16~Myr.

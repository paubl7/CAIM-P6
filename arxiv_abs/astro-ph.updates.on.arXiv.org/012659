Aims: We present the first measurements of the solar-wind angular-momentum (AM) flux recorded
by the Solar Orbiter spacecraft. Our aim is the validation of these measurements to support future
studies of the Sun's AM loss. Methods: We combine 60-minute averages of the proton bulk moments and
the magnetic field measured by the Solar Wind Analyser (SWA) and the magnetometer (MAG) onboard
Solar Orbiter. We calculate the AM flux per solid-angle element using data from the first orbit of
the mission's cruise phase during 2020. We separate the contributions from protons and from magnetic
stresses to the total AM flux. Results: The AM flux varies significantly over time. The particle
contribution typically dominates over the magnetic-field contribution during our measurement
interval. The total AM flux shows the largest variation and is typically anti-correlated with the
radial solar-wind speed. We identify a compression region, potentially associated with a co-rotating
interaction region or a coronal mass ejection, that leads to a significant localised increase in
the AM flux, yet without a significant increase in the AM per unit mass. We repeat our analysis using
the density estimate from the Radio and Plasma Waves (RPW) instrument. Using this independent method,
we find a decrease in the peaks of positive AM flux but otherwise consistent results. Conclusions:
Our results largely agree with previous measurements of the solar-wind AM flux in terms of amplitude,
variability, and dependence on radial solar-wind bulk speed. Our analysis highlights the potential
for future, more detailed, studies of the solar wind's AM and its other large-scale properties with
data from Solar Orbiter. We emphasise the need to study the radial evolution and latitudinal dependence
of the AM flux in combination with data from Parker Solar Probe and assets at heliocentric distances
of 1 au and beyond.

CMB-S4---the next-generation ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB) experiment---is
set to significantly advance the sensitivity of CMB measurements and enhance our understanding
of the origin and evolution of the Universe, from the highest energies at the dawn of time through
the growth of structure to the present day. Among the science cases pursued with CMB-S4, the quest
for detecting primordial gravitational waves is a central driver of the experimental design. This
work details the development of a forecasting framework that includes a power-spectrum-based
semi-analytic projection tool, targeted explicitly towards optimizing constraints on the tensor-to-scalar
ratio, $r$, in the presence of Galactic foregrounds and gravitational lensing of the CMB. This framework
is unique in its direct use of information from the achieved performance of current Stage 2--3 CMB
experiments to robustly forecast the science reach of upcoming CMB-polarization endeavors. The
methodology allows for rapid iteration over experimental configurations and offers a flexible
way to optimize the design of future experiments given a desired scientific goal. To form a closed-loop
process, we couple this semi-analytic tool with map-based validation studies, which allow for
the injection of additional complexity and verification of our forecasts with several independent
analysis methods. We document multiple rounds of forecasts for CMB-S4 using this process and the
resulting establishment of the current reference design of the primordial gravitational-wave
component of the Stage-4 experiment, optimized to achieve our science goals of detecting primordial
gravitational waves for $r > 0.003$ at greater than $5\sigma$, or, in the absence of a detection,
of reaching an upper limit of $r < 0.001$ at $95\%$ CL.

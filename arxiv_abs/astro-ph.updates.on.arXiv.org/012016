In a series of recent papers and in a book, this author put forward a mathematical model capable of
embracing the search for extra-terrestrial intelligence (SETI), Darwinian Evolution and Human
History into a single, unified statistical picture, concisely called Evo-SETI. The relevant mathematical
tools are: (1) Geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the stochastic process representing evolution
as the stochastic increase of the number of species living on Earth over the last 3.5 billion years.
This GBM is well known in the mathematics of finances (Black-Sholes models). (2) The probability
distributions known as b-lognormals, i.e. lognormals starting at a certain positive instant b>0
rather than at the origin. In the framework of Darwinian Evolution, the resulting mathematical
construction was shown to be what evolutionary biologists call Cladistics. (3) The (Shannon) entropy
of such b-lognormals is then seen to represent the 'degree of progress' reached by each living organism
or by each big set of living organisms, like historic human civilizations. (4) All these results
also match with SETI in that the statistical Drake equation (generalization of the ordinary Drake
equation to encompass statistics) leads just to the lognormal distribution as the probability
distribution for the number of extra-terrestrial civilizations existing in the Galaxy. (5) The
well-known 'Molecular Clock of Evolution', namely the 'constant rate of Evolution at the molecular
level' as shown by Kimura's Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution, identifies with growth rate
of the entropy of our Evo-SETI model. (6) Furthermore, we apply our Evo-SETI model to lognormal stochastic
processes other than GBMs. For instance, we provide two models for the mass extinctions that occurred
in the past. (7) Finally, we show that the Markov & Korotayev model for Darwinian Evolution identifies
with an Evo-SETI model.

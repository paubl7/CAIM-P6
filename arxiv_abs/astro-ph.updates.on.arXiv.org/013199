Sixty years ago the first observation was published showing solar energetic particles (SEPs) with
a sampling of chemical elements. Thus began study of the direct products of dynamic physics in the
solar corona. As we have progressed from 4-min sounding-rocket samples to continuous satellite
coverage of SEP events, we have extended the observations to the unusual distribution of element
abundances throughout the periodic table. Small "impulsive" SEP events from islands of magnetic
reconnection on open magnetic-field lines in solar jets generate huge enhancements in abundances
of 3He and of the heaviest elements. Solar flares involve the same physics but there the SEPs are trapped
on closed loops, expending their energy as heat and light. The larger, energetic "gradual" SEP events
are accelerated at shock waves driven by fast, wide coronal mass ejections (CMEs). However, these
shocks can also reaccelerate ions from pools of residual suprathermal impulsive ions, and CMEs
from jets can also drive fast shocks, complicating the picture. The underlying element abundances
in SEP events represent the solar corona, which differs from corresponding abundances in the photosphere
as a function of the first ionization potential (FIP) of the elements, distinguishing low-FIP (<10
eV) ions from high-FIP neutral atoms as they expand through the chromosphere. Dependence of SEP
acceleration upon A/Q allows best-fit estimation of ion Q-values and hence of the source plasma
temperature of ~1 - 3 MK, derived from abundances, which correlates with recent measures of temperatures
using extreme ultraviolet emission from jets. New questions arise, however, about the theoretical
basis of correlations of energy-spectral indices with power-laws of abundances, about the coexistence
of mechanisms for enhancements of 3He and of heavy elements, and about the overall paucity of C in
FIP comparisons.

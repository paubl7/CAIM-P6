Star-forming galaxies with nebular HeII emission contain very energetic ionizing sources of radiation,
which can be considered as analogs to the major contributors of the reionization of the Universe
in early epochs. It is therefore of great importance to provide a reliable absolute scale for the
equivalent effective temperature (T*) for these sources. We study a sample of local (z< 0.2) star-forming
galaxies showing optical nebular HeII emission using the so-called softness diagrams, involving
emission lines of two elements in two consecutive stages of ionization (e.g., [SII]/[SIII] vs.
[OII]/[OIII]). We use for the first time the HeI/heII ratio in these diagrams in order to explore
the higher range of T* expected in these objects.We build grids of photoionization models covering
different black-body temperatures, model cluster atmospheres, and density-bounded geometries
to explain the conditions observed in the sample. We verified that the use of the softness diagrams
including the emission-line ratio HeI/HeII combined with black-body photoionization models
can provide an absolute scale of T* for these objects. The application of a Bayesian-like code indicates
T* in the range 50-80 kK for the sample of galaxies, with a mean value higher than 60 kK. The average
of these high temperature values can only be reproduced using cluster model populations with nearly
metal-free stars, although such ionizing sources cannot explain either the highest T* values,
beyond 1 sigma, or the dispersion observed in the softness diagrams. According to our photoionization
models, most sample galaxies could be affected to some extent by ionizing photon leaking, presenting
a mean photon absorption fraction of 26% or higher depending on the metallicity assumed for the ionizing
cluster.

This brief review will discuss the current knowledge on the origin and evolution of the nitrogen
atmospheres of the icy bodies in the solar system, particularly of Titan, Triton and Pluto. An important
tool to analyse and understand the origin and evolution of these atmospheres can be found in the different
isotopic signatures of their atmospheric constituents. The $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of the N$_2$-dominated
atmospheres of these bodies serve as a footprint of the building blocks from which Titan, Triton
and Pluto originated and of the diverse fractionation processes that shaped these atmospheres
over their entire evolution. Together with other measured isotopic and elemental ratios such as
$^{12}$C/$^{13}$C or Ar/N these atmospheres can give important insights into the history of the
icy bodies in the solar system, the diverse processes that affect their N$_2$-dominated atmospheres,
and the therewith connected solar activity evolution. Titan's gaseous envelope most likely originated
from ammonia ices with possible contributions from refractory organics. Its isotopic signatures
can yet be seen in the - compared to Earth - comparatively heavy $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio of 167.7,
even though this value slightly evolved over its history due to atmospheric escape and photodissociation
of N$_2$. The origin and evolution of Pluto's and Triton's tenuous nitrogen atmospheres remain
unclear, even though it might be likely that their atmospheres originated from the protosolar nebula
or from comets. An in-situ space mission to Triton such as the recently proposed Trident mission,
and/or to the ice giants would be a crucial cornerstone for a better understanding of the origin and
evolution of the icy bodies in the outer solar system and their atmospheres in general.

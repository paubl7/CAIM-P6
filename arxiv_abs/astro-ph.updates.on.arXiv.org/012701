The nature of flows in tornado-prominences is an open issue. While the AIA imager aboard the Solar
Dynamics Observatory (SDO) allowed us to follow the global structure of a tornado-like prominence
during five hours, the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS), and the Multi subtractive
Double pass spectrograph (MSDP) permitted to obtain plasma diagnostics of its fine structures.
We aim to address two questions. Is the observed plasma rotation conceptually acceptable in a flux
rope magnetic support configuration with dips? How is the plasma density distributed in the tornado-like
prominence? We calculated line-of-sight velocities and non-thermal line widths using Gaussian
fitting for Mg II lines and bisector method for H-alpha line. We determined the electron density
from Mg II line integrated intensities and profile fitting methods using 1D NLTE radiative transfer
theory models. The global structure of the prominence observed in H-alpha, and Mg II h and k lines
fits with a magnetic field structure configuration with dips. Coherent Dopplershifts in red- and
blue-shifted areas observed in both lines were detected along rapidly-changing vertical and horizontal
structures. However, the tornado at the top of the prominence consists of multiple-fine threads
with opposite flows suggesting counter streaming flows rather than rotation. Surprisingly we
found that the electron density at the top of the prominence could be larger (10^11 cm^{-3}) than
in the inner part of the prominence. We suggest that the tornado is in a formation state with cooling
of hot plasma in a first phase, and following that, a phase of leakage of the formed blobs with large
transverse flows of material along long loops extended away of the UV prominence top. The existence
of such long magnetic field lines on both sides of the prominence would avoid the tornado-like prominence
to really turn around its axis.

The Reionization Era Bright Emission Line Survey (REBELS) is a cycle-7 ALMA Large Program (LP) that
is identifying and performing a first characterization of many of the most luminous star-forming
galaxies known in the z>6.5 universe. REBELS is providing this probe by systematically scanning
40 of the brightest UV-selected (-23.0<M_{UV,AB}<-21.3) galaxies identified over a 7-deg**2
area (including the wide-area COSMOS/UltraVISTA, VIDEO/XMM-LSS, and UKIDSS/UDS fields) for
bright 158-micron [CII] and 88-micron [OIII] lines and dust-continuum emission. Selection of
the 40 REBELS targets was done by combining our own and other photometric selections, each of which
is subject to extensive vetting using three completely independent sets of photometry and template-fitting
codes. Building on the observational strategy deployed in two pilot programs, we are increasing
the number of massive interstellar medium (ISM) reservoirs known at z>6.5 by ~4-5x to >30. In this
manuscript, we motivate the observational strategy deployed in the REBELS program and present
initial results. Based on the 60.6 hours of ALMA observations taken in the first year of the program
(November 2019 to January 2020), 18 highly significant >~7sigma [CII] lines have already been discovered,
the bulk of which (13/18) also show >~3 sigma dust-continuum emission. These newly discovered lines
more than triple the number of bright ISM-cooling lines known in the z>6.5 universe, such that the
number of ALMA-derived redshifts at z>6.5 already rival Lya redshift discoveries. An analysis
of the completeness of our search results vs. star formation rate (SFR) suggests an ~81% efficiency
in scanning for [CII] when the SFR(UV+IR) is in excess of 20 M_sol/yr. These new LP results further
demonstrate ALMA's efficiency as a "redshift machine", particularly in the epoch of reionization.

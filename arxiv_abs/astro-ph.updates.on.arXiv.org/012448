We present a method to self-consistently propagate M$_{*}$ and SFR ($\Psi$) uncertainties onto
intercept, slope and intrinsic scatter estimates for a simple model of the main sequence of star
forming galaxies where $\Psi = \alpha + \beta$M$_{*} + \mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$. From simple idealised
models set up with broad-band photometry from NIRCam filters at $z\sim5$, we test the method and
compare to methods in the literature. Simplifying the $\Psi$ estimate by basing it on dust-corrected
MUV can help to reduce the impact of template set degeneracies on slope and intercept estimates,
but act to bias the intrinsic scatter estimate. We find that broad-band fluxes alone cannot constrain
the contribution from emission lines, implying that strong priors on the emission-line contribution
are required if no medium-band constraints are available. Therefore at high redshifts, where emission
lines contribute a higher fraction of the broad-band flux, photometric fitting is sensitive to
$\Psi$ variations on short ($\sim$ 10 Myr) timescales. Priors on age imposed with a constant (or
rising) star formation history (SFH) do not allow one to investigate a possible dependence of $\sigma$
on M$_{*}$ at high redshifts. Delayed exponential SFHs have less constrained priors, but do not
account for $\Psi$ variations on short timescales, a problem if $\sigma$ increases due to stochasticity
of star formation. A simple SFH with current star formation decoupled from the previous history
is appropriate. We show that, for simple exposure-time calculations assuming point sources, with
low levels of dust, we should be able to obtain unbiased estimates of the main sequence down to log(M/M$_{\odot}$)
$\sim$ 8 at $z\sim5$ with the James Webb Space Telescope while allowing for stochasticity of star
formation.

The detection of AT2017gfo proved that binary neutron star mergers are progenitors of kilonovae.
Using a combination of numerical-relativity and radiative-transfer simulations, the community
has developed sophisticated models for these transients for a wide portion of the expected parameter
space. Using these simulations and surrogate models made from them, it has been possible to perform
Bayesian inference of the observed signals to infer properties of the ejected matter. It has been
pointed out that combining inclination constraints derived from the kilonova with gravitational-wave
measurements increases the accuracy with which binary parameters can be measured and allows a more
accurate inference of the Hubble Constant. In order to not introduce biases, constraints on the
inclination angle for AT2017gfo should be insensitive to the employed models. In this work, we compare
different assumptions about the ejecta and radiative reprocesses used by the community and we investigate
their impact on the parameter inference. While most inferred parameters agree, we find disagreement
between posteriors for the inclination angle for different geometries that have been used in the
literature. According to our study, the inclusion of reprocessing of the photons between different
ejecta types improves the modeling fits to AT2017gfo and in some cases affects the inferred constraints.
Our study motivates the inclusion of large $\sim$ 1 mag uncertainties in the kilonova models employed
for Bayesian analysis to capture yet unknown systematics, especially when inferring inclination
angles, although smaller uncertainties seem appropriate to capture model systematics for other
parameters. We also use this method to impose soft constraints on the ejecta geometry of the kilonova
AT2017gfo.

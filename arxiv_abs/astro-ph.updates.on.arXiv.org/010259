Recent surveys indicate that planets in binary systems are more abundant than previously thought,
which is in agreement with theoretical work on disc dynamics and planet formation in binaries. In
order to measure the abundance and physical characteristics of wide-orbit giant exoplanets in
binary systems, we have designed the 'VIsual Binary Exoplanet survey with Sphere' (VIBES) to search
for planets in visual binaries. It uses the SPHERE instrument at VLT to search for planets in 23 visual
binary and four visual triple systems with ages of <145 Myr and distances of <150 pc. We used the IRDIS
dual-band imager on SPHERE to acquire high-contrast images of the sample targets. For each binary,
the two components were observed at the same time with a coronagraph masking only the primary star.
For the triple star, the tight components were treated as a single star for data reduction. This enabled
us to effectively search for companions around 50 individual stars in binaries and four binaries
in triples. We derived upper limits of $<$13.7\% for the frequency of sub-stellar companions around
primaries in visual binaries, $<$26.5\% for the fraction of sub-stellar companions around secondaries
in visual binaries, and an occurrence rate of $<$9.0\% for giant planets and brown dwarfs around
either component of visual binaries. We have combined our observations with literature measurements
to astrometrically confirm, for the first time, that 20 binaries and two triple systems, which were
previously known, are indeed physically bound. Finally, we discovered a third component of the
binary HD~121336. The upper limits we derived are compatible with planet formation through the
core accretion and the gravitational instability processes in binaries. These limits are also
in line with limits found for single star and circumbinary planet search surveys.

A significant fraction of all $\gamma$-ray sources detected by the Large Area Telescope aboard
the \fer\ satellite is still lacking a low-energy counterpart. In addition, there is still a large
population of $\gamma$-ray sources with associated low-energy counterparts that lack firm classifications.
In the last 10 years we have undertaken an optical spectroscopic campaign to address the problem
of unassociated/unidentified $\gamma$-ray sources (UGSs), mainly devoted to observing blazars
and blazar candidates because they are the largest population of $\gamma$-ray sources associated
to date. Here we describe the overall impact of our optical spectroscopic campaign on sources associated
in \fer-LAT catalogs, coupled with objects found in the literature. In the literature search, we
kept track of efforts by different teams that presented optical spectra of counterparts or potential
counterparts of \fer-LAT catalog sources. Our summary includes an analysis of an additional 30
newly-collected optical spectra of counterparts or potential counterparts of \fer-LAT sources
of previously unknown nature.New spectra were acquired at the Blanco 4-m and OAN-SPM 2.1-m telescopes,
and those available in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (data release 15) archive. All new sources with
optical spectra analyzed here are classified as blazars. Thanks to our campaign, we altogether
discovered and classified 394 targets with an additional 123 objects collected from a literature
search. We began our optical spectroscopic campaign between the release of the second and third
\fer-LAT source catalogs (2FGL and 3FGL, respectively), and classified about 25\% of the sources
with uncertain nature and discovered a blazar-like potential counterpart for $\sim$10\% of UGSs
listed therein. In the 4FGL catalog, about 350 \fer-LAT sources are classified to date thanks to
our campaign. [incomplete abstract]

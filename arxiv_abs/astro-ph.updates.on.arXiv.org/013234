[Abbreviated] Rest-frame UV emission lines probe physical parameters of the emitting star-forming
galaxies and their environments. The strongest main UV line, Ly$\alpha$, has been instrumental
in advancing the general knowledge of galaxy formation in the early universe. However, observing
Ly$\alpha$ emission becomes increasingly challenging at $z \gtrsim 6$ when the neutral hydrogen
fraction of the CGM and IGM increases. Secondary weaker UV emission lines provide important alternative
methods for studying galaxy properties at high redshift. We present a large sample of rest-frame
UV emission line sources at intermediate redshift for calibrating and exploring the connection
between secondary UV lines and the emitting galaxies' physical properties and their Ly$\alpha$
emission. The sample of 2052 emission line sources with $1.5 < z < 6.4$ was selected through untargeted
source detection in three-dimensional MUSE data cubes. We searched optimally extracted 1D spectra
of the full sample for UV emission features via emission line template matching, resulting in a sample
of more than 100 rest-frame UV emission line detections. We show that the detection efficiency of
(non-Ly$\alpha$) UV emission lines increases with survey depth, and that the UV emission line strength
often correlate with the strength of Ciii]. We measured the velocity offsets of resonant emission
lines with respect to systemic tracers as well as the electron density and the gas-phase abundance.
Lastly, using "PhotoIonization Model Probability Density Functions" we find that the UV line emitters
generally have ionization parameter log10(U) $\approx$ -2.5 and metal mass fractions that scatter
around Z $\approx$ 10$^{-2}$, that is Z $\approx$ 0.66Z$\odot$. Value-added catalogs of the full
sample of MUSE objects studied in this work and a collection of UV line emitters from the literature
are provided with this paper.

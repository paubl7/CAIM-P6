We seek to update the spectroscopy binary fraction of the SACY (Search for Associations Containing
Young stars) sample taking in consideration all possible biases in our identification of binary
candidates, such as activity and rotation. Using high-resolution spectroscopic observations
we have produced $\sim$1300 cross-correlation functions (CCFs) to disentangle the previously
mentioned sources of contamination. The radial velocity values obtained were cross-matched with
the literature and were used to revise and update the spectroscopic binary (SB) fraction in each
of the SACY association. In order to better describe the CCF profile, we calculated a set of high-order
cross-correlation features to determine the origin of the variations in radial velocities. We
identified 68 SB candidates from our sample of 410 objects. Our results hint that the youngest associations
have a higher SB fraction. Specifically, we found sensitivity-corrected SB fractions of $22 \substack{+15
\\ -11} \%$ for $\epsilon$~Cha , $31 \substack{+16 \\ -14} \%$ for TW Hya and $32 \substack{+9 \\ -8}
\%$ for $\beta$~Pictoris, in contrast with the five oldest ($\sim 35-125$ Myr) associations we
have sampled which are $\sim 10\%$ or lower. This result seems independent of the methodology used
to asses membership to the associations. The new CCF analysis, radial velocity estimates and SB
candidates are particularly relevant for membership revision of targets in young stellar associations.
These targets would be ideal candidates for follow-up campaigns using high-resolution techniques
in order to confirm binarity, resolve the orbits, and ideally calculate dynamical masses. Additionally,
if the results on SB fraction in the youngest associations are confirmed, it could hint of non-universal
multiplicity among SACY associations.

Young giant planets and brown dwarf companions emit near-infrared radiation that can be linearly
polarized up to several percent. This polarization can reveal the presence of a circumsubstellar
accretion disk, rotation-induced oblateness of the atmosphere, or an inhomogeneous distribution
of atmospheric dust clouds. We measured the near-infrared linear polarization of 20 known directly
imaged exoplanets and brown dwarf companions with the high-contrast imager SPHERE-IRDIS at the
VLT. We reduced the data using the IRDAP pipeline to correct for the instrumental polarization and
crosstalk with an absolute polarimetric accuracy <0.1% in the degree of polarization. We report
the first detection of polarization originating from substellar companions, with a polarization
of several tenths of a percent for DH Tau B and GSC 6214-210 B in H-band. By comparing the measured polarization
with that of nearby stars, we find that the polarization is unlikely to be caused by interstellar
dust. Because the companions have previously measured hydrogen emission lines and red colors,
the polarization most likely originates from circumsubstellar disks. Through radiative transfer
modeling, we constrain the position angles of the disks and find that the disks must have high inclinations.
The presence of these disks as well as the misalignment of the disk of DH Tau B with the disk around its
primary star suggest in situ formation of the companions. For the 18 other companions, we do not detect
significant polarization and place subpercent upper limits on their degree of polarization. These
non-detections may indicate the absence of circumsubstellar disks, a slow rotation rate of young
companions, the upper atmospheres containing primarily submicron-sized dust grains, and/or
limited cloud inhomogeneity. Finally, we present images of the circumstellar disks of DH Tau, GQ
Lup, PDS 70, Beta Pic, and HD 106906.

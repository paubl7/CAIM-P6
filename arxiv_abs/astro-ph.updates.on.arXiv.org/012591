We make use of ALMA continuum observations of $15$ luminous Lyman-break galaxies at $z$$\sim$$7$$-$$8$
to probe their dust-obscured star-formation. These observations are sensitive enough to probe
to obscured SFRs of $20$ $M_{\odot}$$/$$yr$ ($3\sigma$). Six of the targeted galaxies show significant
($\geq$$3$$\sigma$) dust continuum detections, more than doubling the number of known dust-detected
galaxies at $z$$>$$6.5$. Their IR luminosities range from $2.7$$\times$$10^{11}$ $L_{\odot}$
to $1.1$$\times$$10^{12}$ $L_{\odot}$, equivalent to obscured SFRs of $20$ to $105$ $M_{\odot}$$/$$yr$.
We use our results to quantify the correlation of the infrared excess IRX on the UV-continuum slope
$\beta_{UV}$ and stellar mass. Our results are most consistent with an SMC attenuation curve for
intrinsic $UV$-slopes $\beta_{UV,intr}$ of $-2.63$ and most consistent with an attenuation curve
in-between SMC and Calzetti for $\beta_{UV,intr}$ slopes of $-2.23$, assuming a dust temperature
$T_d$ of $50$ K. Our fiducial IRX-stellar mass results at $z$$\sim$$7$$-$$8$ are consistent with
marginal evolution from $z$$\sim$$0$. We then show how both results depend on $T_d$. For our six
dust-detected sources, we estimate their dust masses and find that they are consistent with dust
production from SNe if the dust destruction is low ($<$$90$%). Finally we determine the contribution
of dust-obscured star formation to the star formation rate density for $UV$ luminous ($<$$-$$21.5$
mag: $\gtrsim$$1.7$$L_{UV} ^*$) $z$$\sim$$7$$-$$8$ galaxies, finding that the total SFR density
at $z$$\sim$$7$ and $z$$\sim$$8$ from bright galaxies is $0.18_{-0.10}^{+0.08}$ dex and $0.20_{-0.09}^{+0.05}$
dex higher, respectively, i.e. $\sim$$\frac{1}{3}$ of the star formation in $\gtrsim$$1.7$$L_{UV}
^*$ galaxies at $z$$\sim$$7$$-$$8$ is obscured by dust.

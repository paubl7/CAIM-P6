Context: The accretion history of the Milky Way is still unknown, despite the recent discovery of
stellar systems that stand out in terms of their energy-angular momentum space, such as Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage.
In particular, it is still unclear how these groups are linked and to what extent they are well-mixed.
Aims: We investigate the similarities and differences in the properties between the prograde and
retrograde (counter-rotating) stars and set those results in context by using the properties of
Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage, Thamnos/Sequoia, and other suggested accreted populations. Methods:
We used the stellar metallicities of the major large spectroscopic surveys (APOGEE, Gaia-ESO,
GALAH, LAMOST, RAVE, SEGUE) in combination with astrometric and photometric data from Gaia's second
data-release. We investigated the presence of radial and vertical metallicity gradients as well
as the possible correlations between the azimuthal velocity, $v_\phi,$ and metallicity, [M/H],
as qualitative indicators of the presence of mixed populations. Results: We find that a handful
of super metal-rich stars exist on retrograde orbits at various distances from the Galactic center
and the Galactic plane. We also find that the counter-rotating stars appear to be a well-mixed population,
exhibiting radial and vertical metallicity gradients on the order of $\sim$ -0.04 dex/kpc and -0.06
dex/kpc, respectively, with little (if any) variation when different regions of the Galaxy are
probed. The prograde stars show a $v_\phi$-[M/H] relation that flattens -- and, perhaps, even reverses
as a function of distance from the plane. Retrograde samples selected to roughly probe Thamnos and
Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage appear to be different populations yet they also appear to be quite linked,
as they follow the same trend in terms of the eccentricity versus metallicity space.

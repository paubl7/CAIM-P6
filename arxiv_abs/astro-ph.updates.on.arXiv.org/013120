We characterized the kinematics, morphology, and stellar population (SP) properties of a sample
of massive compact quiescent galaxies (MCGs, $10 \lesssim \log M_\star$/$M_\odot \lesssim 11$
and $r_{\rm e} \sim 1-3 $kpc) in the MaNGA Survey, with the goal of constraining their formation,
assembly history and assessing their relation with non-compact quiescent galaxies. We compared
their properties with those of a control sample of median-sized quiescent galaxies ($r_{\rm e}
\sim 4-8 $kpc) with similar effective velocity dispersions. MCGs have elevated rotational support,
as evidenced by a strong anti-correlation between the Gauss-Hermite moment $h_3$ and $V/\sigma$.
In contrast, 30$\%$ of control sample galaxies (CSGs) are slow rotators, and fast-rotating CSGs
generally show a weak $h_3-V/\sigma$ anti-correlation. MCGs and CSGs have similar ages, but MCGs
are more metal-rich and $\alpha$-enhanced. Both MCGs and CSGs have shallow negative metallicity
gradients and flat [$\alpha$/Fe] gradients. On average, MCGs and CSGs have flat age gradients,
but CSGs have a significantly larger dispersion of gradient values. The kinematics and SP properties
of MCGs suggest that they experienced highly-dissipative gas-rich events, such as mergers, followed
by an intense, short, and centrally concentrated burst of star formation, between 4 to 10 Gyr ago
($z\sim0.4-2$), and had a quiet accretion history since then. This sequence of events might be analogous
to, although less extreme than, the compaction events which formed compact quiescent galaxies
at $z \sim 2$. The small sizes of MCGs, and the high efficiency and short duration of their last star
formation episode suggest that they are descendants of compact post-starburst galaxies.

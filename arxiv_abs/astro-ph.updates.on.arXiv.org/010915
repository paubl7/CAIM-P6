Context. The derived physical parameters for young HII regions are normally determined assuming
the emission region to be optically thin. However, this assumption is unlikely to hold for young
HII regions such as hyper-compact HII(HCHII) and ultra-compact HII(UCHII) regions and leads to
the underestimation of their properties. This can be overcome by fitting the SEDs over a wide range
of radio frequencies. Aims. The two primary goals of this study are (1) to determine the physical
properties of young HII regions from radio SEDs in the search for potential HCHII regions, and (2)
to use these physical properties to investigate their evolution. Method. We used the Karl G. Jansky
Very Large Array (VLA) to observe the X-band and K-band with angular resolutions of ~1.7" and ~0.7",
respectively, toward 114 HII regions with rising-spectra between 1-5 GHz. We complement our observations
with VLA archival data and construct SEDs in the range of 1-26 GHz and model them assuming an ionization-bounded
HII region with uniform density. Results. Our sample has a mean electron density of ne=1.6E4cm^{-3},
diameter diam=0.14pc, and emission measure EM = 1.9E7pc*cm^{-6}. We identify 16 HCHII region candidates
and 8 intermediate objects between the classes of HCHII and UCHII regions. The ne, diam, and EM change
as expected, but the Lyman continuum flux is relatively constant over time. We find that about 67%
of Lyman-continuum photons are absorbed by dust within these HII regions and the dust absorption
fraction tends to be more significant for more compact and younger HII regions. Conclusion. Young
HII regions are commonly located in dusty clumps; HCHII regions and intermediate objects are often
associated with various masers, outflows, broad radio recombination lines, and extended green
objects, and the accretion at the two stages tends to be quickly reduced or halted.

The accuracy of photometric redshifts (photo-zs) particularly affects the results of the analyses
of galaxy clustering with photometrically-selected galaxies (GCph) and weak lensing. In the next
decade, space missions like Euclid will collect photometric measurements for millions of galaxies.
These data should be complemented with upcoming ground-based observations to derive precise and
accurate photo-zs. In this paper, we explore how the tomographic redshift binning and depth of ground-based
observations will affect the cosmological constraints expected from Euclid. We focus on GCph and
extend the study to include galaxy-galaxy lensing (GGL). We add a layer of complexity to the analysis
by simulating several realistic photo-z distributions based on the Euclid Consortium Flagship
simulation and using a machine learning photo-z algorithm. We use the Fisher matrix formalism and
these galaxy samples to study the cosmological constraining power as a function of redshift binning,
survey depth, and photo-z accuracy. We find that bins with equal width in redshift provide a higher
Figure of Merit (FoM) than equipopulated bins and that increasing the number of redshift bins from
10 to 13 improves the FoM by 35% and 15% for GCph and its combination with GGL, respectively. For GCph,
an increase of the survey depth provides a higher FoM. But the addition of faint galaxies beyond the
limit of the spectroscopic training data decreases the FoM due to the spurious photo-zs. When combining
both probes, the number density of the sample, which is set by the survey depth, is the main factor
driving the variations in the FoM. We conclude that there is more information that can be extracted
beyond the nominal 10 tomographic redshift bins of Euclid and that we should be cautious when adding
faint galaxies into our sample, since they can degrade the cosmological constraints.

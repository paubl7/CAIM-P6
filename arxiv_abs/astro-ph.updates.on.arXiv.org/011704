We revisit the theory of stochastic heating of ions and investigate its phase-space signatures
in kinetic turbulence of relevance to low-$\beta$ portions of the solar wind. We retain a full scale-dependent
approach in our treatment, and consider the case in which electric-field fluctuations can be described
by a generalized Ohm's law that includes Hall and thermo-electric effects. These two electric-field
terms provide the dominant contributions to stochastic ion heating when the ion-Larmor scale is
much smaller than the ion skin depth, $\rho_{\mathrm{i}}\ll d_{\mathrm{i}}$, which is the case
at $\beta{\ll}1$. Employing well-known spectral scaling laws for Alfv\'en-wave and kinetic-Alfv\'en-wave
turbulent fluctuations, we obtain scaling relations characterizing the field-perpendicular
particle-energization rate and energy diffusion coefficient associated with stochastic heating
in these two regimes. Phase-space signatures of ion heating are then investigated using 3D hybrid-kinetic
simulations of continuously driven Alfv\'enic turbulence at low $\beta$. In these simulations,
energization of ions parallel to the magnetic field is sub-dominant compared to its perpendicular
counterpart ($Q_{\parallel,\mathrm{i}}\ll Q_{\perp,\mathrm{i}}$), and the fraction of turbulent
energy that goes into ion heating is ${\approx}75$\% at $\beta_{\mathrm{i}}=0.3$ and ${\approx}40$\%
at $\beta_{\mathrm{i}}{\simeq}0.1$. The phase-space signatures of ion energization are consistent
with Landau-resonant collisionless damping and a ($\beta$-dependent) combination of ion-cyclotron
and stochastic heating. We demonstrate good agreement between our theory and various signatures
associated with the stochastic portion of the heating. We discuss the effect of intermittency on
stochastic heating and the implications of our work for the interpretation of stochastic heating
in solar-wind spacecraft data.

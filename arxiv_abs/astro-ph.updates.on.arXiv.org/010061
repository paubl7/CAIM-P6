[Abridged] The formation of Jupiter is modeled via core-nucleated accretion, and the planet's
evolution is simulated up to the present epoch. The growth from a small embryo until gas accretion
overtakes solids' accretion was presented by D'Angelo et al. (Icarus 2014, 241, 298). Those calculations
followed the formation for $4\times 10^{5}$ years, until the heavy-element and H/He masses were
$M_{Z}\approx 7.3$ and $M_{XY}\approx 0.15$ Earth's masses ($M_{\oplus}$), respectively, and
$dM_{XY}/dt\approx dM_{Z}/dt$. The calculation is continued through the phase when $M_{XY}=M_{Z}$,
at which age, about $2.4\times 10^{6}$ years, the planet mass is $M_{p}\approx 20\,M_{\oplus}$.
About $9\times 10^{5}$ years later, $M_{p}$ is approximately $60\,M_{\oplus}$ and $M_{Z}\approx
16\,M_{\oplus}$. Around this epoch, the contraction of the envelope dictates gas accretion rates
a few times $10^{-3}\,M_{\oplus}$ per year, initiating the regime of disk-limited accretion,
when the planet's evolution is tied to disk's evolution. Growth is continued by constructing simplified
models of accretion disks that evolve through viscous diffusion, winds, and accretion on the planet.
Jupiter's formation ends after $\approx 3.4$-$4.2$ Myr, when nebula gas disperses. The young Jupiter
is $4.5$-$5.5$ times as voluminous as it is presently and thousands of times as luminous, $\sim 10^{-5}\,L_{\odot}$.
The heavy-element mass is $\approx 20\,M_{\oplus}$. The evolution proceeds through the cooling
and contraction phase, in isolation except for solar irradiation. After $4570$ Myr, radius and
luminosity of the planet are within $10$% of current values. During formation, and soon thereafter,
the planet exhibits features, e.g., luminosity and effective temperature, that may probe aspects
of the latter stages of formation, if observable. These possibly distinctive features, however,
seem to disappear within a few tens of Myr.

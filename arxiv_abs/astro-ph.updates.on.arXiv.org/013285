Describing how the properties of the interstellar medium combine across size-scales is crucial
for understanding star formation scaling laws and connecting Galactic and extragalactic data
of molecular clouds. We describe how the statistical structure of clouds, and its connection to
star formation, changes from sub-parsec to kiloparsec scales in a complete region within the Milky
Way disk. We build a census of molecular clouds within 2 kpc from the Sun using literature. We examine
the dust-based column density probability distributions (N-PDFs) of the clouds and their relation
to star formation traced by young stellar objects (YSOs). We then examine our survey region from
the outside, within apertures of varying sizes, and describe how the N-PDFs and their relation to
star formation changes with the size-scale. The N-PDFs of the clouds are not well described by any
single simple model; use of any single model may bias the interpretation of the N-PDFs. The top-heaviness
of the N-PDFs correlates with star formation activity, and the correlation changes with Galactic
environment (spiral-/inter-arm regions). We find that the density contrast of clouds may be more
intimately linked to star formation than the dense gas mass fraction. The aperture-averaged N-PDFs
vary with the size-scale and are more top-heavy for larger apertures. The top-heaviness of the aperture
N-PDFs correlates with star formation activity up to roughly 0.5 kpc size-scale, depending on the
environment. Our results suggest that the relations between cloud structure and star formation
are environment specific and best captured by relative quantities (e.g., the density contrast).
Finally, we show how the density structures of individual clouds give rise to a kpc-scale Kennicutt-Schmidt
relationship as a combination of sampling effects and blending of different galactic environments.

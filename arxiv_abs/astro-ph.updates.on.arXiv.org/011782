Interferometric measurements with arrays of radio antennas are a powerful and widely used technique
in astronomy. Recently, this technique has been revisited for the reconstruction of extensive
air showers [1]. This radio-interferometric technique exploits the coherence in the radio emission
emitted by billions of secondary shower particles to reconstruct the shower parameters, in particular
the shower axis and depth of the shower maximum $X_\mathrm{max}$. The accuracy previously demonstrated
on simulations with an idealized detector is very promising. In this article we evaluate the potential
of interferometric $X_\mathrm{max}$ measurements using (simulated) inclined air showers with
sparse antenna arrays under realistic conditions. To determine prerequisites for the application
of the radio-interferometric technique with various antenna arrays, the influence of inaccuracies
in the time synchronisation between antennas and its inter-dependency with the antenna density
is investigated in detail. We find a strong correlation between the antenna multiplicity (per event)
and the maximum acceptable time jitter, i.e., inaccuracy in the time synchronisation. For data
recorded with a time synchronisation accurate to within 1 ns in the commonly used frequency band
of 30 to 80 MHz, an antenna multiplicity of $> 50$ is needed to achieve an $X_\mathrm{max}$ resolution
of $\sigma_{X_\mathrm{max}} \lesssim 20$ g cm$^{-2}$. For data recorded with 2 ns accuracy, already
$\gtrsim 200$ antennas are needed to achieve this $X_\mathrm{max}$ resolution. Furthermore,
we find no advantage reconstructing $X_\mathrm{max}$ from data simulated at higher observation
frequencies, i.e., up to several hundred MHz. Finally, we provide a generalisation of our results
from very inclined air showers to vertical geometries.

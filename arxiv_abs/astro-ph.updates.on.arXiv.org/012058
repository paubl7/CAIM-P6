We present X-ray and multi-band optical observations of the afterglow and host galaxy of GRB 180418A,
discovered by ${\it Swift}$/BAT and ${\it Fermi}$/GBM. We present a reanalysis of the GBM and BAT
data deriving durations of the prompt emission of $T_{90}\approx$2.56s and $\approx$1.90s, respectively.
Modeling the ${\it Fermi}$/GBM catalog of 1405 bursts (2008-2014) in the Hardness-$T_{90}$ plane,
we obtain a probability of $\approx$60% that GRB 180418A is a short-hard burst. From a combination
of ${\it Swift}$/XRT and ${\it Chandra}$ observations, the X-ray afterglow is detected to $\approx$38.5
days after the burst, and exhibits a single power-law decline with $F_{\rm X} \propto t^{-0.98}$.
Late-time Gemini observations reveal a faint r$\approx$25.69 mag host galaxy at an angular offset
of $\approx$0.16''. At the likely redshift range of z$\approx$1-2.25, we find that the X-ray afterglow
luminosity of GRB 180418A is intermediate between short and long GRBs at all epochs during which
there is contemporaneous data, and that GRB 180418A lies closer to the $E_{\gamma,{\rm peak}}-E_{\gamma,{\rm
iso}}$ correlation for short GRBs. Modeling the multi-wavelength afterglow with the standard
synchrotron model, we derive the burst explosion properties and find a jet opening angle of $\theta_{\rm
j} \gtrsim 9-14^{\circ}$. If GRB 180418A is a short GRB that originated from a neutron star merger,
it has one of the brightest and longest-lived afterglows along with an extremely faint host galaxy.
If instead the event is a long GRB that originated from a massive star collapse, it has among the lowest
luminosity afterglows, and lies in a peculiar space in terms of the Hardness-$T_{90}$ and $E_{\gamma,{\rm
peak}}-E_{\gamma,{\rm iso}}$ planes.

With the successes of $f(R)$ theory as a neutral modification of the Einstein general relativity
(GR), we continue our study in this field and attempt to find general natural and charged black hole
(BH) solutions. In the previous papers (arXiv:2012.05711 and arXiv:2010.04701), we applied the
field equation of the $f(R)$ gravity to a spherically symmetric space-time $ds^2=-U(r)dt^2+\frac{dr^2}{V(r)}+r^2
\left( d\theta^2+\sin^2\theta d\phi^2 \right)$ with unequal metric potentials $U(r)$ and $V(r)$
and with/without electric charge. To ensure the closed form of system of the resulting differential
equations, we assumed the derivative of the $f(R)$ with respect to the scalar curvature $R$ to have
a form $F_1(r)=\frac{df(R(r))}{dR(r)} \propto \frac{c}{r^n}$ but in case $n>2$, the resulting
black hole solutions with/without charge do not generate asymptotically GR BH solutions in the
limit $c\rightarrow 0$ which means that the only case that can generate GR BHs is $n=2$. In this paper,
we assume another form, i.e., $F_1(r)= 1-\frac{F_0-\left(n-3\right)}{r^n}$ with a constant
$F_0$ and show that we can generate asymptotically GR BH solutions for $n>2$ but we show that $n=2$
case is not allowed. This form of $F_1(r)$ could be the most acceptable physical form that we can generate
from it physical metric potentials that can have well known asymptotic form and we obtain the metric
of the Einstein general relativity in the limit of $F_0\to n-3$. We show that the form of the electric
charge depends on $n$ and that $n\neq 2$. Our study shows that the power $n$ is sensitive and why we
should exclude the case $n=2$ for the choice of $F_1(r)$ presented in this study. We also study the
physics of these black hole solutions by calculating their thermodynamical quantities, like entropy,
the Hawking temperature and Gibb's free energy, and derive the stability conditions by using geodesic
deviations.

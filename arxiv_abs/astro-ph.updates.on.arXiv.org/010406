Droplets of absolutely stable strange quark matter (strangelets) immersed in a lepton background
may be the energetically preferred composition of strange star crusts and may also constitute the
interior of a new class of stellar objects known as strangelet dwarfs. In this work we calculate the
surface tension $\sigma$ of charged strangelets as a function of the baryon number density, the
temperature, the chemical potential of trapped neutrinos, the strangelet size, the electric potential
and the electric charge at their boundary. Strange quark matter in chemical equilibrium and with
global electric charge neutrality is described within the MIT bag model. We focus on three different
astrophysical scenarios, namely cold strange stars, proto strange stars and post merger strange
stars, characterized by the temperature and the amount of neutrinos trapped in the system. Finite
size effects are implemented within the multiple reflection expansion framework. We find that
the surface tension decreases significantly as the strangelet's boundary becomes more positively
charged. This occurs because $\sigma$ is dominated by the contribution of $s$ quarks which are the
most massive particles in the system. Negatively charged $s$-quarks are suppressed in strangelets
with a large positive electric charge, diminishing their contribution to $\sigma$ and resulting
in smaller values of the total surface tension. We also verify that the more extreme astrophysical
scenarios, with higher temperatures and higher neutrino chemical potentials, allow higher positive
values of the strangelet's electric charge at the boundary and consequently smaller values of $\sigma$.
We discuss some astrophysical consequences of these results.

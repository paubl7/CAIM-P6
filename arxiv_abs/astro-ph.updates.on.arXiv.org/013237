We present an update of the open-source photochemical kinetics code VULCAN (Tsai et al. 2017; https://github.com/exoclime/VULCAN)
to include C-H-N-O-S networks and photochemistry. Additional new features are advection transport,
condensation, various boundary conditions, and temperature-dependent UV cross-sections. First,
we validate our photochemical model for hot Jupiter atmospheres by performing an intercomparison
of HD 189733b models between Moses et al. (2011), Venot et al. (2012), and VULCAN, to diagnose possible
sources of discrepancy. Second, we set up a model of Jupiter extending from the deep troposphere
to upper stratosphere to verify the kinetics for low temperature. Our model reproduces hydrocarbons
consistent with observations, and the condensation scheme successfully predicts the locations
of water and ammonia ice clouds. We show that vertical advection can regulate the local ammonia distribution
in the deep atmosphere. Third, we validate the model for oxidizing atmospheres by simulating Earth
and find agreement with observations. Last, VULCAN is applied to four representative cases of extrasolar
giant planets: WASP-33b, HD 189733b, GJ 436b, and 51 Eridani b. We look into the effects of the C/O
ratio and chemistry of titanium/vanadium species for WASP-33b; we revisit HD 189733b for the effects
of sulfur and carbon condensation; the effects of internal heating and vertical mixing ($K_{\textrm{zz}}$)
are explored for GJ 436b; we test updated planetary properties for 51 Eridani b with S$_8$ condensates.
We find sulfur can couple to carbon or nitrogen and impact other species such as hydrogen, methane,
and ammonia. The observable features of the synthetic spectra and trends in the photochemical haze
precursors are discussed for each case.

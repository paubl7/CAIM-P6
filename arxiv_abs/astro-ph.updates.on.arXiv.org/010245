Context. The origin of giant planets at moderate separations $\simeq$$1$$-$$10$ au is still not
fully understood because numerical studies of Type II migration in protoplanetary disks often
predict a decay of the semi-major axis that is too fast. According to recent 2D simulations, inward
migration of a gap-opening planet can be slowed down or even reversed if the outer gap edge becomes
heated by irradiation from the central star, and puffed up. Aims. Here we study how stellar irradiation
reduces the disk-driven torque and affects migration in more realistic 3D disks. Methods. Using
3D hydrodynamic simulations with radiation transfer, we investigated the static torque acting
on a single gap-opening planet embedded in a passively heated accretion disk. Results. Our simulations
confirm that a temperature inversion is established at the irradiated outer gap edge and the local
increase of the scale height reduces the magnitude of the negative outer Lindblad torque. However,
the temperature excess is smaller than assumed in 2D simulations and the torque reduction only becomes
prominent for specific parameters. For the viscosity $\alpha=10^{-3}$, the total torque is reduced
for planetary masses ranging from $0.1$ to $0.7$ Jupiter mass, with the strongest reduction being
by a factor of $-0.17$ (implying outward migration) for a Saturn-mass planet. For a Jupiter-mass
planet, the torque reduction becomes stronger with increasing $\alpha$ (the torque is halved when
$\alpha=5\times10^{-3}$). Conclusions. We conclude that planets that open moderately wide and
deep gaps are subject to the largest torque modifications and their Type II migration can be stalled
due to gap edge illumination. We then argue that the torque reduction can help to stabilize the orbits
of giant planets forming at $\gtrsim$$1$ au.

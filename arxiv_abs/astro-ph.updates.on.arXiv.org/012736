One of the key noise sources that currently limits high-contrast imaging observations for exoplanet
detection is quasi-static speckles. Quasi-static speckles originate from slowly evolving non-common
path aberrations (NCPA). The purpose of this work is to present a proof-of-concept on-sky demonstration
of spatial Linear Dark Field Control (LDFC). The ultimate goal of LDFC is to stabilize the point spread
function (PSF) by addressing NCPA using the science image as additional wavefront sensor. We combined
spatial LDFC with the Asymmetric Pupil vector-Apodizing Phase Plate (APvAPP) on the Subaru Coronagraphic
Extreme Adaptive Optics system at the Subaru Telescope. In this paper, we report the results of the
first successful proof-of-principle LDFC on-sky tests. We present results from two types of cases:
(1) correction of instrumental errors and atmospheric residuals plus artificially induced static
aberrations introduced on the deformable mirror and (2) correction of only atmospheric residuals
and instrumental aberrations. When introducing artificial static wavefront aberrations on the
DM, we find that LDFC can improve the raw contrast by a factor of $3$--$7$ over the dark hole. In these
tests, the residual wavefront error decreased by $\sim$50 nm RMS, from $\sim$90 nm to $\sim40$ nm
RMS. In the case with only residual atmospheric wavefront errors and instrumental aberrations,
we show that LDFC is able to suppress evolving aberrations that have timescales of $<0.1$--$0.4$
Hz. We find that the power at $10^{-2}$ Hz is reduced by a factor of $\sim$20, 7, and 4 for spatial frequency
bins at 2.5, 5.5, and 8.5 $\lambda/D$, respectively. The results presented in this work show that
LDFC is a promising technique for enabling the high-contrast imaging goals of the upcoming generation
of extremely large telescopes.

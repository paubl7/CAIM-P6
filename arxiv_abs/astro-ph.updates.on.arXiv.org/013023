In this paper we present and validate the galaxy sample used for the analysis of the Baryon Acoustic
Oscillation signal (BAO) in the Dark Energy Survey (DES) Y3 data. The definition is based on a colour
and redshift-dependent magnitude cut optimized to select galaxies at redshifts higher than 0.5,
while ensuring a high quality photometric redshift determination. The sample covers $\approx
4100$ square degrees to a depth of $i = 22.3 \ (AB)$ at $10\sigma$. It contains 7,031,993 galaxies
in the redshift range from $z$= 0.6 to 1.1, with a mean effective redshift of 0.835. Photometric redshifts
are estimated with the machine learning algorithm DNF, and are validated using the VIPERS PDR2 sample.
We find a mean redshift bias of $z_{\mathrm{bias}} \approx 0.01$ and a mean uncertainty, in units
of $1+z$, of $\sigma_{68} \approx 0.03$. We evaluate the galaxy population of the sample, showing
it is mostly built upon Elliptical to Sbc types. Furthermore, we find a low level of stellar contamination
of $\lesssim 4\%$. We present the method used to mitigate the effect of spurious clustering coming
from observing conditions and other large-scale systematics. We apply it to the DES Y3 BAO sample
and calculate sample weights that are used to get a robust estimate of the galaxy clustering signal.
This paper is one of a series dedicated to the analysis of the BAO signal in the DES Y3 data. In the companion
papers, Ferrero et al. (2021) and DES Collaboration (2021), we present the galaxy mock catalogues
used to calibrate the analysis and the angular diameter distance constraints obtained through
the fitting to the BAO scale, respectively. The galaxy sample, masks and additional material will
be released in the public DES data repository upon acceptance.

We present spatially resolved measurements of cool gas flowing into and out of the Milky Way (MW),
using archival ultraviolet spectra of background quasars from the Hubble Space Telescope/Cosmic
Origins Spectrograph. We co-add spectra of different background sources at close projected angular
separation on the sky. This novel stacking technique dramatically increases the signal-to-noise
ratio of the spectra, allowing detection of low column density gas (down to $EW$ > 2 mA). We identify
absorption as inflowing or outflowing, by using blue/redshifted high velocity cloud (HVC) absorption
components in the Galactocentric rest frame, respectively. The mass surface densities of inflowing
and outflowing gas both vary by more than an order of magnitude across the sky, with mean values of
$\langle \Sigma_{in}\rangle \gtrsim 10^{4.6\pm0.1}$ $M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$ for
inflowing gas and $\langle \Sigma_{out}\rangle \gtrsim 10^{3.5\pm 0.1}$ $M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}$
for outflowing gas, respectively. The mass flow rate surface densities (mass flow rates per unit
area) also show large variation across the sky with $\langle \dot{\Sigma}(d)_{in}\rangle \gtrsim
(10^{-3.6\pm0.1})(d/12 \mathrm{kpc})^{-1} M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2} \mathrm{yr}^{-1}$
for inflowing and $\langle \dot{\Sigma}(d)_{out}\rangle \gtrsim (10^{-4.8\pm0.1})(d/12\,\mathrm{kpc})^{-1}
M_{\odot}\,\mathrm{kpc}^{-2}\,\mathrm{yr}^{-1}$ for outflowing gas, respectively. The regions
with highest surface mass density of inflowing gas are clustered at smaller angular scales ($\theta
< 40^\circ$). This indicates that most of the mass in inflowing gas is confined to small, well-defined
structures, whereas the distribution of outflowing gas is spread more uniformly throughout the
sky. Our study confirms that the MW is predominantly accreting gas, but is also losing a non-negligible
mass of gas via outflow.

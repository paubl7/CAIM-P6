Intensity mapping of multiple emission lines is emerging as a new branch to astronomy, to probe both
properties of ionizing sources and the medium between, in particular the intergalactic medium.
For Epoch of Reionization (EoR) studies, both multi-line experiments and analysis methods are
still in their infancy. Here we explore optimal survey parameters for Ly$\alpha$ (and H$\alpha$)
intensity mapping up to high redshifts of reionization, and requirements for optimised synergy
with 21cm experiments. We investigate line sensitivity, spectral resolution and detector pixel
size requirements for optimal (high signal-to-noise) mission output. Power and cross-power spectra
in a fiducial setup are derived, as are mock intensity maps. For line power spectrum measurements
a cumulative signal-to-noise of O$\left(10^3 \right)$, and for respective cross-spectra with
SKA 21cm observations of O$\left(10\right)$ to O$\left(10^2\right)$ are possible per redshift
bin around the midpoint of reionization. These high signal-to-noise tomographic measurements
are in reach for line sensitivities $>8\times 10^{-18}$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1}$,
spectral resolution $R>250$ and detector pixel sizes $<2\,$arcsec; all three requirements are
met by the proposed Cosmic Dawn Intensity Mapper (CDIM). For CDIM similar S/N values are in reach
for H$\alpha$. Already the planned NASA mission SPHEREx will detect during the EoR Ly$\alpha$ autopower
and cross power with 21cm, for sensitivities better than $10^{-18}$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1}$
in a moderate 21cm foreground scenario (better than $10^{-17}$erg$\,$s$^{-1}$sr$^{-1}$Hz$^{-1}$
in an optimistic scenario). We advocate for IR missions in flavor of CDIM for a leap in IM and finish
by providing a cookbook for successful multi-line IM during the EoR.

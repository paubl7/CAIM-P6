Pulsars in the Galactic centre promise to enable unparalleled tests of gravity theories and black
hole physics and to serve as probes of the stellar formation history and evolution and the interstellar
medium in the complex central region of the Milky Way. The community has surveyed the innermost region
of the galaxy for decades without detecting a population of pulsars, which is puzzling. A strong
scattering of the pulsed signals in this particular direction has been argued to be a potential reason
for the non-detections. Scattering has a strong inverse dependence on observing frequency, therefore
an effective way to alleviate its effect is to use higher frequencies in a survey for pulsars in the
Galactic centre, in particular, close to the supermassive black hole Sagittarius A*. We present
the first pulsar survey at short millimetre wavelengths, using several frequency bands between
84 and 156 GHz (3.57-1.92 mm), targeted to the Galactic centre. The observations were made with the
Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique (IRAM) 30m Telescope in 28 epochs between 2016 December
and 2018 May. This survey is the first that is essentially unaffected by scattering and therefore
unbiased in population coverage, including fast-spinning pulsars that might be out of reach of
lower-frequency Galactic centre surveys. We discovered no new pulsars and relate this result mainly
to the decreased flux density of pulsars at high frequencies, combined with our current sensitivity.
However, we demonstrate that surveys at these extremely high radio frequencies are capable of discovering
new pulsars, analyse their sensitivity limits with respect to a simulated Galactic centre pulsar
population, and discuss the main challenges and possible improvements for similar surveys in the
future.

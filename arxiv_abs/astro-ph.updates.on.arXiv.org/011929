[...] This paper presents a rigorous derivation of a goodness-of-fit statistics for colour-magnitude
diagrams (CMD). We discuss the reliability of the underlying assumptions and their validity. We
derived the distribution of the sum of squared Mahalanobis distances of stellar data and theoretical
isochrone for a generic set of data and models. We applied this to the case of synthetic CMDs constructed
to mimic real data of open clusters in the GAIA sample. We analysed the capability of distinguishing
among different sets of input physics and parameters that were used to compute the stellar models.
We generated synthetic clusters from isochrones computed with these perturbed quantities, and
we evaluated the goodness-of-fit with respect to the unperturbed isochrone. We show that when $r$
magnitudes are available for each of the $N$ observational objects and $p$ hyperparameters are
estimated in the fit, the error distribution follows a $\chi^2$ distribution with $(r-1)N - p$ degrees
of freedom. We show that the linearisation of the isochrone causes negligible deviation from this
result. We investigated the possibility of detecting the effects on stellar models that are induced
when varying convective core overshooting efficiency, $^{14}$N$(p,\gamma)^{15}$O reaction
rate, microscopic diffusion velocities, outer BCs, and colour transformation. The results suggest
that it is possible to detect the effect induced by only some of the perturbed quantities. [...] A
variation in the convective core overshooting efficiency was detectable only for photometric
errors of 0.003 mag and only for the 1 Gyr case. The effects induced by the outer boundary conditions
and the bolometric corrections are the largest. [...] As a last exercise, we addressed the validity
of the goodness-of-fit statistics for real-world open cluster CMDs, contaminated by field stars
or unresolved binaries. [...]

In recent years, dramatic outbursts have been identified toward massive protostars via infrared
and millimeter dust continuum and molecular maser emission. The longest lived outburst ($>6$ yr)
persists in NGC6334I-MM1, a deeply-embedded object with no near-IR counterpart. Using FORCAST
and HAWC+ on SOFIA, we have obtained the first mid-infrared images of this field since the outburst
began. Despite being undetected in pre-outburst ground-based 18 $\mu$m images, MM1 is now the brightest
region at all three wavelengths (25, 37, and 53 $\mu$m), exceeding the ultracompact HII region MM3
(NGC6334F). Combining the SOFIA data with ALMA imaging at four wavelengths, we construct a spectral
energy distribution of the combination of MM1 and the nearby hot core MM2. The best-fit Robitaille
radiative transfer model yields a luminosity of $(4.9\pm0.8)\times10^4 L_\odot$. Accounting
for an estimated pre-outburst luminosity ratio MM1:MM2 = $2.1\pm0.4$, the luminosity of MM1 has
increased by a factor of $16.3\pm4.4$. The pre-outburst luminosity implies a protostar of mass
6.7 $M_\odot$, which can produce the ionizing photon rate required to power the pre-outburst hypercompact
HII region surrounding the likely outbursting protostar MM1B. The total energy and duration of
the outburst exceed the S255IR-NIRS3 outburst by a factor of $\gtrsim3$, suggesting a different
scale of event involving expansion of the protostellar photosphere (to $\gtrsim$ 20 $R_\odot$),
thereby supporting a higher accretion rate ($\gtrsim$0.0023 $M_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) and reducing
the ionizing photon rate. In the grid of hydrodynamic models of Meyer et al. 2021, the combination
of outburst luminosity and magnitude (3) places the NGC6334I-MM1 event in the region of moderate
total accretion ($\sim$0.1-0.3 $M_\odot$) and hence long duration ($\sim$40-130 yr).

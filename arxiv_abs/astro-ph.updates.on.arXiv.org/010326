Gravitational wave (GW) detections have considerably enriched our understanding of the universe.
To date, all the known events were observed via direct detection. In this paper, we study a GW detection
technique based on astrometric observation and demonstrate that it offers a highly flexible frequency
range that can uniquely complement existing detection methods. Using repeated point-source astrometric
measurements, periodic GW-induced deflections can be extracted and wave parameters inferred.
We illustrate how high-cadence observations of the galactic bulge, such as offered by the Roman
Space Telescope's Exoplanet MicroLensing (EML) survey, have the potential to be a potent GW probe
with complementary frequency range to Gaia, pulsar timing arrays (PTAs), and the Laser Interferometer
Space Antenna (LISA). We calculate that the Roman EML survey is sensitive to GWs with frequencies
ranging from $7.7\times10^{-8}~{\rm{Hz}}$ to $5.6\times10^{-4}~\rm{Hz}$, which opens up a
unique GW observing window for supermassive black hole binaries and their waveform evolution.
While the detection threshold assuming the currently expected performance proves too high for
detecting individual GWs in light of the expected supermassive black hole binary population distribution,
we show that binaries with chirp mass $M_c>10^{7.6}~M_\odot$ out to 10 Mpc can be detected if the
telescope is able to achieve an astrometric accuracy of 0.11 mas. To confidently detect binaries
with $M_c>10^{7}~M_\odot$ out to 50 Mpc, a factor of 100 sensitivity improvement is required. We
propose several improvement strategies, including recovering the mean astrometric deflection
and increasing astrometric accuracy, number of observed stars, field-of-view size, and observational
cadence. We also discuss how other existing and planned photometric surveys could contribute to
detecting GWs via astrometry.

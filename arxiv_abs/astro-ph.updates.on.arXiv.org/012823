The interpretation of Galactic synchrotron observations is complicated by the degeneracy between
the strength of the magnetic field perpendicular to the line of sight (LOS), $B_\perp$, and the cosmic-ray
electron (CRe) spectrum. Depending on the observing frequency, an energy-independent spectral
energy slope $s$ for the CRe spectrum is usually assumed: $s=-2$ at frequencies below $\simeq$400
MHz and $s=-3$ at higher frequencies. Motivated by the high angular and spectral resolution of current
facilities such as the LOw Frequency ARray (LOFAR) and future telescopes such as the Square Kilometre
Array (SKA), we aim to understand the consequences of taking into account the energy-dependent
CRe spectral energy slope on the analysis of the spatial variations of the brightness temperature
spectral index, $\beta$, and on the estimate of the average value of $B_\perp$ along the LOS. We illustrate
analytically and numerically the impact that different realisations of the CRe spectrum have on
the interpretation of the spatial variation of $\beta$. We find that the common assumption of an
energy-independent $s$ is valid only in special cases. We show that for typical magnetic field strengths
of the diffuse interstellar medium ($\simeq$2$-$20 $\mu$G), at frequencies of 0.1$-$10 GHz, the
electrons that are mainly responsible for the synchrotron emission have energies in the range $\simeq$100
MeV$-$50 GeV. This is the energy range where the spectral slope, $s$, of CRe has its greatest variation.
We also show that the polarisation fraction can be much smaller than the maximum value of $\simeq
70\%$ because the orientation of ${\bf B}_\perp$ varies across the telescope's beam and along the
LOS. Finally, we present a look-up plot that can be used to estimate the average value of $B_\perp$
along the LOS from a set of values of $\beta$ measured at centimetre to metre wavelengths, for a given
CRe spectrum.

We forecast the reionization history constraints, inferred from Lyman-alpha damping wing absorption
features, for a future sample of $\sim 20$ $z \geq 6$ gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows. We describe
each afterglow spectrum by a three-parameter model. First, L characterizes the size of the ionized
region (the "bubble size") around a GRB host halo. Second, $\langle{x_{\rm HI}\rangle}$ is the
volume-averaged neutral fraction outside of the ionized bubble around the GRB, which is approximated
as spatially uniform. Finally, $N_{\mathrm{HI}}$ denotes the column-density of a local damped
Lyman-alpha absorber (DLA) associated with the GRB host galaxy. The size distribution of ionized
regions is extracted from a numerical simulation of reionization, and evolves strongly across
the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). The model DLA column densities follow the empirical distribution
determined from current GRB afterglow spectra. We use a Fisher matrix formalism to forecast the
$\langle{x_{\rm HI}(z)\rangle}$ constraints that can be obtained from follow-up spectroscopy
of afterglows with SNR = 20 per R=3,000 resolution element at the continuum. We find that the neutral
fraction may be determined to better than 10-15\% (1-$\sigma$) accuracy from this data across multiple
independent redshift bins at $z \sim 6-10$, spanning much of the EoR, although the precision degrades
somewhat near the end of reionization. A more futuristic survey with $80$ GRB afterglows at $z \geq
6$ can improve the precision here by a factor of $2$ and extend measurements out to $z \sim 14$. We further
discuss how these constraints may be combined with estimates of the escape fraction of ionizing
photons, derived from the DLA column density distribution towards GRBs extracted at slightly lower
redshift. This combination will help in testing whether we have an accurate census of the sources
that reionized the universe.

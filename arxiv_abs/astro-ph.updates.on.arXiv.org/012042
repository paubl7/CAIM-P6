We present the first cluster catalog extracted from combined space-based (Planck) and ground-based
(South Pole Telescope; SPT-SZ) millimeter data. We developed and applied a matched multi-filter
(MMF) capable of dealing with the different transfer functions and resolutions of the two datasets.
We verified that it produces results consistent with publications from Planck and SPT collaborations
when applied on the datasets individually. We also verified that Planck and SPT-SZ cluster fluxes
are consistent with each other. When applied blindly to the combined dataset, the MMF generated
a catalog of 419 detections ($S/N>5$), of which 323 are already part of the SPT-SZ or PSZ2 catalogs;
54 are new SZ detections, which have been identified in other catalogs or surveys; and 42 are new unidentified
candidates. The MMF takes advantage of the complementarity of the two datasets, Planck being particularly
useful for detecting clusters at a low redshift ($z<0.3$), while SPT is efficient at finding higher
redshift ($z>0.3$) sources. This work represents a proof of concept that blind cluster extraction
can be performed on combined, inhomogeneous millimeter datasets acquired from space and ground.
This result is of prime importance for planned ground-based cosmic microwave background (CMB)
experiments (e.g., Simons Observatory, CMB-S4) and envisaged CMB space missions (e.g., PICO,
Backlight) that will detect hundreds of thousands of clusters in the low mass regime ($M_{500} \leqslant
10^{14} M_\odot$), for which the various sources of intra-cluster emission (gas, dust, synchrotron)
will be of the same order of magnitude and hence require broad ground and space frequency coverage
with a comparable spatial resolution for adequate separation.

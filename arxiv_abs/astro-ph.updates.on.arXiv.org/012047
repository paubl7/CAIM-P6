We carried a detailed spectral and temporal study of blazar, \mbox{PKS\,0903-57} using the \emph{Fermi}-LAT
and \emph{Swift}-XRT/UVOT observations, during its brightest flaring period MJD\,58931--58970.
During this period, the maximum daily averaged $\gamma$-ray flux ($\rm F_{0.1-500\,GeV}$) of
$\rm9.42\times10^{-6}\,ph\,cm^{-2}\,s^{-1}$ is observed on MJD\,58951.5, the highest $\gamma$-ray
flux detected from \mbox{PKS\,0903-57} till now. Several high-energy (HE) photons ($>\,10$\,GeV)
consistent with the source location at high probability (>\,99\%) are detected, and the $\gamma$-ray
lightcurve in the active state shows multiple substructures with asymmetric profile. In order
to understand the possible physical scenario responsible for the flux enhancement, we carried
a detailed broadband spectral study of \mbox{PKS\,0903-57} by choosing different flux states
from its active period. Neglecting the multi-band variability in each of the selected time intervals,
we could reproduce their averaged broadband SEDs with a one-zone leptonic model whose parameters
were derived with a $\chi^2$-fit. We found that the broadband SED during different flux states can
be reproduced by the synchrotron, synchrotron-self-Compton (SSC) and External-Compton (EC)
processes. The seed photons for EC process from BLR or IR torus provide acceptable fits to the GeV
spectrum in all the flux states; however, the detection of HE photons together with the equipartition
condition suggest that the EC/IR process is a more likely scenario. Further, a detailed comparison
between the fit parameters shows that the flux enhancement from quiescent-state to the flaring-state
is mostly related to increase in the bulk Lorentz factor of the emission region and change in the break
energy of the source spectrum.

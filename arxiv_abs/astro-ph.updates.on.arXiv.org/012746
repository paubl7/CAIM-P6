Recently, the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration (LVC) concluded that there is no evidence for lensed gravitational
waves (GW) in the first half of the O3 run, claiming "We find the observation of lensed events to be
unlikely, with the fractional rate at $\mu>2$ being $3.3\times 10^{-4}$". While we agree that the
chance of an individual GW event being lensed at $\mu>2$ is smaller than $10^{-3}$, the number of
observed events depends on the product of this small probability times the rate of mergers at high
redshift. Observational constraints from the stochastic GW background indicate that the rate
of conventional mass BBH mergers (8 < M (M$_{\odot}$) < 15) in the redshift range 1<z< 2 could be as
high as O($10^7$) events per year, more than sufficient to compensate for the intrinsically low
probability of lensing. To reach the LVC trigger threshold these events require high magnification,
but would still produce up to 10 to 30 LVC observable events per year. Thus, all the LVC observed ordinary
stellar mass BBH mergers from this epoch must be strongly lensed. By adopting low-rates at high redshift,
LVC assumes that lensed events can not be taking place, thus incorrectly assigning them a closer
distance and higher masses by a factor of a few (typically 2 to 5). The LVC adopted priors on time delay
are in tension with the distribution of observed time delays in lensed quasars. Pairs of events like
GW190421-GW190910 and GW190424-GW190910, which are directly assigned a probability of zero by
LVC, should be instead considered as prime candidates to be strongly lensed GW pairs, since their
separation in time is consistent with observations of time delays in lensed quasars. Correcting
for the LVC wrong Bayesian priors, maximum merger rate of conventional mass BBH in 1<z<2, and gravitational
lensing time-delay model, reverses the LVC conclusions and supports the strong gravitational
lensing hypothesis.

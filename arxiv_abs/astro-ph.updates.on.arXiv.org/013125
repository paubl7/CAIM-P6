Globular clusters (GCs) are important tools to rebuild the accretion history of a galaxy. There
are newly discovered GCs in the Sagittarius (Sgr) dwarf galaxy, that can be used as probes of the accretion
event onto the Milky Way (MW). Our main aim is to characterize the Sgr GC system by measuring its main
physical parameters. We build the optical and near-IR color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) for 21 new
Sgr GCs using the VISTA Variables in the Via Lactea Extended Survey (VVVX) near-IR database combined
with the Gaia EDR3 optical database. We derive metallicities and ages for all targets, using the
isochrone-fitting method and the RGB-slope and metallicity relation. The total luminosities
are calculated both in the near-IR and in the optical. We construct the metallicity distribution
(MD), the globular cluster luminosity function (GCLF), and the age-metallicity relation for the
Sgr GC system. We find 17 metal-rich GCs with -0.9<[Fe/H]<-0.3, 4 metal-poor GCs with -2.0<[Fe/H]<-1.1
in the new Sgr GC sample. Even though our age estimates are rough, we find that the metal-poor GCs are
consistent with an old population with an average age of ~13 Gyr, while the metal-rich GCs show a wider
age range, between 6-8 Gyr and 10-13 Gyr. We compare the MD and the GCLF for the Sgr GC system with those
of the MW, M31 and Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxies. We conclude that the majority of the metal-rich
GCs are located within the main body of Sgr galaxy. We confirm that the GCLF is not a universal distribution,
since the Sgr GCLF peaks at fainter luminosities than the GCLFs of the MW, M31 and LMC. The MD shows
a double-peaked distribution, and we note that the metal-rich population looks like the MW bulge
GCs. We compared our results with the literature concluding that the Sgr progenitor could have been
a reasonably large galaxy able to retain the SNe ejecta, thus enriching its ISM.

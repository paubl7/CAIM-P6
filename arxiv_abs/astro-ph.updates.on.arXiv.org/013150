Planet formation around one component of a tight, eccentric binary system such as $\gamma$ Cephei
(with semimajor axis around 20 AU) is theoretically challenging because of destructive high-velocity
collisions between planetesimals. Despite this fragmentation barrier, planets are known to exist
in such orbital configurations. Here we present a novel numerical framework for carrying out multi-annulus
coagulation-fragmentation calculations of planetesimal growth, which fully accounts for the
specifics of planetesimal dynamics in binaries, details of planetesimal collision outcomes,
and the radial transport of solids in the disk due to the gas drag-driven inspiral. Our dynamical
inputs properly incorporate the gravitational effects of both the eccentric stellar companion
and the massive non-axisymmetric protoplanetary disk in which planetesimals reside, as well as
gas drag. We identify a set of disk parameters that lead to successful planetesimal growth in systems
such as $\gamma$ Cephei or $\alpha$ Centauri starting from $1-10$ km size objects. We identify the
apsidal alignment of a protoplanetary disk with the binary orbit as one of the critical conditions
for successful planetesimal growth: It naturally leads to the emergence of a dynamically quiet
location in the disk (as long as the disk eccentricity is of order several percent), where favorable
conditions for planetesimal growth exist. Accounting for the gravitational effect of a protoplanetary
disk plays a key role in arriving at this conclusion, in agreement with our previous results. These
findings lend support to the streaming instability as the mechanism of planetesimal formation.
They provide important insights for theories of planet formation around both binary and single
stars, as well as for the hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary disks in binaries (for which
we identify a set of key diagnostics to verify).

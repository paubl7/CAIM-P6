The Andromeda galaxy is the best-known large galaxy besides our own Milky Way. Several images and
studies exist at all wavelengths from radio to hard X-ray. Nevertheless, only a few observations
are available in the microwave range where its average radio emission reaches the minimum. In this
paper, we want to study the radio morphology of the galaxy, decouple thermal from nonthermal emission,
and extract the star formation rate. We also aim to derive a complete catalog of radio sources for
the mapped patch of sky. We observed the Andromeda galaxy with the Sardinia Radio Telescope at 6.6
GHz with very high sensitivity and angular resolution, and an unprecedented sky coverage. Using
new 6.6 GHz data and Effelsberg radio telescope ancillary data, we confirm that, globally, the spectral
index is $\sim 0.7-0.8$, while in the star forming regions it decreases to $\sim 0.5$. By disentangling
(gas) thermal and nonthermal emission, we find that at 6.6 GHz, thermal emission follows the distribution
of HII regions around the ring. Nonthermal emission within the ring appears smoother and more uniform
than thermal emission because of diffusion of the cosmic ray electrons away from their birthplaces.
This causes the magnetic fields to appear almost constant in intensity. Furthermore, we calculated
a map of the star formation rate based on the map of thermal emission. Integrating within a radius
of $R_{max}=15$ kpc, we obtained a total star formation rate of $0.19 \pm 0.01$ $M_{\odot}$/yr in
agreement with previous results in the literature. Finally, we correlated our radio data with infrared
images of the Andromeda galaxy. We find an unexpectedly high correlation between nonthermal and
mid-infrared data in the central region, with a correlation parameter $r=0.93$.

We study the flux variation in helium white dwarfs (WDs) induced by dynamical tides for a variety
of WD models with effective temperatures ranging from $T$=10 kK to $T$=26 kK. At linear order, we
find the dynamical tide can significantly perturb the observed flux in hot WDs. If the temperature
$T\gtrsim14$ kK, then the dynamical tide may induce a fractional change in the flux by >1% when the
orbital period is $P_{\rm orb}\simeq 20-60\,{\rm min}$. The ratio between the flux modulation
due to the dynamical tide and that due to the equilibrium tide (i.e., ellipsoidal variability) increases
as the WD's radius decreases, and it could exceed O(10) if the WD has a radius $R\lesssim0.03 R_\odot$.
Unlike the ellipsoidal variability which is in phase with the orbital motion, the pulsation caused
by the dynamical tide may have a substantial phase shift. A cold WD with $T\lesssim 10$ kK, on the other
hand, is unlikely to show observable pulsations due to the dynamical tide. At shorter orbital periods,
the dynamical tide may become highly nonlinear. We approximate this regime by treating the waves
as one-way traveling waves and find the flux variation is typically reduced to 0.1%-1% and the excess
phase is likely to be 90 degrees (though with large uncertainty). Even in the traveling-wave limit,
the flux perturbation due to dynamical tide could still exceed the ellipsoidal variability for
compact WDs with $R\lesssim0.02 R_\odot$. We further estimate the nonlinear flux perturbations
oscillating at four times the orbital frequency dominated by a self-coupled parent g-mode driving
low-order daughter p-modes. The nonlinear flux variation could be nearly 50% of the linear variation
for very hot WD models with $T\gtrsim26$ kK and 1% linear flux variation. We thus predict both the
linear and nonlinear flux variations due to dynamical tides are likely to have significant observational
signatures.

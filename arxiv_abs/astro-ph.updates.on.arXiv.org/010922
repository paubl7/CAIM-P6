The Pluto-Charon system provides a broad variety of constraints on planetary formation, composition,
chemistry, and evolution. Pluto was the first body to be discovered in what is now known as the Kuiper
belt, its orbit ultimately becoming a major clue that the giant planets underwent substantial orbital
migration early in Solar System history. This migration has been linked to an early instability
in the orbits of the giant planets and the formation of the Kuiper belt itself, from an ancestral trans-Neptunian
planetesimal disk that included Pluto. Pluto-Charon is emblematic of what are now recognized as
small or dwarf planets. Far from being a cold, dead, battered icy relic, Pluto displays evidence
of a complex geological history, with ongoing processes including tectonism, cryovolcanism,
solid-state convection, glacial flow, atmospheric circulation, surface-atmosphere volatile
exchange, aeolian processes, and atmospheric photochemistry, microphysics, and haze formation.
Despite Pluto's relatively modest scale, the combination of original accretional heat, long-term
internal radiogenic heat release, and external solar forcing, when combined with sufficiently
volatile (and thus mobile) materials, yields an active world. Pluto may have inherited a large organic
mass fraction during accretion, which may responsible, in part, for its surface and atmospheric
volatiles. Charon, Pluto's major moon, displays evidence of extensive early tectonism and cryovolcanism.
Dwarf planets are thus truly planetary in terms of satellite systems and geological and atmospheric
complexity (if not ongoing activity). What they may lack in mass is made up in number, and the majority
of the Solar System's dwarf planets remain undiscovered.

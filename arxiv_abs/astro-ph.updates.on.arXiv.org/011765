ASASSN-18am/SN 2018gk is a newly discovered member of the rare group of luminous, hydrogen-rich
supernovae (SNe) with a peak absolute magnitude of $M_V \approx -20$ mag that is in between normal
core-collapse SNe and superluminous SNe. These SNe show no prominent spectroscopic signatures
of ejecta interacting with circumstellar material (CSM), and their powering mechanism is debated.
ASASSN-18am declines extremely rapidly for a Type II SN, with a photospheric-phase decline rate
of $\sim6.0~\rm mag~(100 d)^{-1}$. Owing to the weakening of HI and the appearance of HeI in its later
phases, ASASSN-18am is spectroscopically a Type IIb SN with a partially stripped envelope. However,
its photometric and spectroscopic evolution show significant differences from typical SNe IIb.
Using a radiative diffusion model, we find that the light curve requires a high synthesised $\rm
^{56}Ni$ mass $M_{\rm Ni} \sim0.4~M_\odot$ and ejecta with high kinetic energy $E_{\rm kin} = (7-10)
\times10^{51} $ erg. Introducing a magnetar central engine still requires $M_{\rm Ni} \sim0.3~M_\odot$
and $E_{\rm kin}= 3\times10^{51} $ erg. The high $\rm ^{56}Ni$ mass is consistent with strong iron-group
nebular lines in its spectra, which are also similar to several SNe Ic-BL with high $\rm ^{56}Ni$
yields. The earliest spectrum shows "flash ionisation" features, from which we estimate a mass-loss
rate of $ \dot{M}\approx 2\times10^{-4}~\rm M_\odot~yr^{-1} $. This wind density is too low to
power the luminous light curve by ejecta-CSM interaction. We measure expansion velocities as high
as $ 17,000 $ km/s for $H_\alpha$, which is remarkably high compared to other SNe II. We estimate an
oxygen core mass of $1.8-3.4$ $M_\odot$ using the [OI] luminosity measured from a nebular-phase
spectrum, implying a progenitor with a zero-age main sequence mass of $19-26$ $M_\odot$.

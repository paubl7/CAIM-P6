Rapidly decaying long-period oscillations often occur in hot coronal loops of active regions associated
with small (or micro-) flares. This kind of wave activity was first discovered with the SOHO/SUMER
spectrometer from Doppler velocity measurements of hot emission lines, thus also often called
"SUMER" oscillations. They were mainly interpreted as global (or fundamental mode) standing slow
magnetoacoustic waves. In addition, increasing evidence has suggested that the decaying harmonic
type of pulsations detected in light curves of solar and stellar flares are likely caused by standing
slow-mode waves. The study of slow magnetoacoustic waves in coronal loops has become a topic of particular
interest in connection with coronal seismology. We review recent results from SDO/AIA and Hinode/XRT
observations that have detected both standing and reflected intensity oscillations in hot flaring
loops showing the physical properties (e.g., oscillation periods, decay times, and triggers)
in accord with the SUMER oscillations. We also review recent advances in theory and numerical modeling
of slow-mode waves focusing on the wave excitation and damping mechanisms. MHD simulations in 1D,
2D and 3D have been dedicated to understanding the physical conditions for the generation of a reflected
propagating or a standing wave by impulsive heating. Various damping mechanisms and their analysis
methods are summarized. Calculations based on linear theory suggest that the non-ideal MHD effects
such as thermal conduction, compressive viscosity, and optically thin radiation may dominate
in damping of slow-mode waves in coronal loops of different physical conditions. Finally, an overview
is given of several important seismological applications such as determination of transport coefficients
and heating function.

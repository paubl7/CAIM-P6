Galaxies in dense environments are subject to interactions and mechanisms which directly affect
their evolution by lowering their gas fractions and reducing their star-forming capacity earlier
than their isolated counterparts. The aim of our project is to get new insights about the role of environment
on the stellar and baryonic content of galaxies using a kinematic approach, through the study of
the Tully-Fisher relation (TFR). We study a sample of galaxies in 8 groups spanning a redshift range
of $0.5<z<0.8$ and located in 10 pointings of the MAGIC MUSE Guaranteed Time Observations program.
We perform a morpho-kinematics analysis of this sample and set up a selection based on galaxy size,
[OII] emission line doublet signal-to-noise ratio, bulge-to-disk ratio and nuclear activity
to construct a robust kinematic sample of 67 star-forming galaxies. This selection considerably
reduces the number of outliers in the TFR, which are predominantly dispersion-dominated galaxies.
Our results suggest a significant offset of the TFR zero-point between galaxies in low- and high-density
environments, whatever kinematics estimator is used. This can be interpreted as a decrease of either
stellar mass by $\sim 0.05 - 0.3$ dex or an increase of rotation velocity by $\sim 0.02 - 0.06$ dex for
galaxies in groups, depending on the samples used for comparison. We also studied the stellar and
baryon mass fractions within stellar disks and found they both increase with stellar mass, the trend
being more pronounced for the stellar component alone. These fractions do not exceed 50%. We show
that this evolution of the TFR is consistent either with a decrease of star formation or with a contraction
of the mass distribution due to the environment. These two effects probably act together with their
relative contribution depending on the mass regime.

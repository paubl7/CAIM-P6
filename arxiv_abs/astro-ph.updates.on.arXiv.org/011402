We study the release of energy during the gradual phase of a flare, characterized by faint bursts
of non-thermal hard X-ray (HXR) emission associated with decimetric radio spikes and type III radio
bursts starting at high frequencies and extending to the heliosphere. We characterize the site
of electron acceleration in the corona and study the radial evolution of radio source sizes in the
high corona. Imaging and spectroscopy of the HXR emission with Fermi and RHESSI provide a diagnostic
of the accelerated electrons in the corona as well as a lower limit on the height of the acceleration
region. Radio observations in the decimetric range with the ORFEES spectrograph provide radio
diagnostics close to the acceleration region. Radio spectro-imaging with LOFAR in the meter range
provide the evolution of the radio source sizes with their distance from the Sun, in the high corona.
Non-thermal HXR bursts and radio spikes are well correlated on short timescales. The spectral index
of non-thermal HXR emitting electrons is -4 and their number is about $2\times 10^{33}$ electrons/s.
The density of the acceleration region is constrained between $1-5 \times 10^9$ cm$^{-3}$. Electrons
accelerated upward rapidly become unstable to Langmuir wave production, leading to high starting
frequencies of the type III radio bursts, and the elongation of the radio beam at its source is between
0.5 and 11.4 Mm. The radio source sizes and their gradient observed with LOFAR are larger than the
expected size and gradient of the size of the electron beam, assuming it follows the expansion of
the magnetic flux tubes. These observations support the idea that the fragmentation of the radio
emission into spikes is linked to the fragmentation of the acceleration process itself. The combination
of HXR and radio diagnostics in the corona provides strong constrains on the site of electron acceleration.

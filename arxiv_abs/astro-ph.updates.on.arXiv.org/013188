Observations of small-scale brightenings in the low solar atmosphere can provide valuable constraints
on possible heating/heat-transport mechanisms. We present a method for the detection and analysis
of brightenings and demonstrate its application to IRIS EUV time-series imagery. The method uses
band-pass filtering, adaptive thresholding and centroid tracking, and records an event's position,
duration, and total/maximum brightness. Area, brightness, and position are also recorded as functions
of time throughout their lifetime. Detected brightenings can fragment or merge over time, thus
the number of distinct regions constituting a brightening event is recorded over time and the maximum
number of regions are recorded as a simple measure of an event's coherence/complexity. A test is
made on a synthetic datacube composed of a static background based on IRIS data, Poisson noise and
$\approx10^4$ randomly-distributed, moving, small-scale Gaussian brightenings. Maximum brightness,
total brightness, area, and duration follow power-law distributions and the results show the range
over which the method can extract information. The recorded maximum brightness is a reliable measure
for the brightest and most accurately detected events with an error of 6%. Area, duration, and speed
are generally underestimated by 15% with an uncertainty of 20-30%. Total brightness is underestimated
by 30% with an uncertainty of 30%. Applying this method to real IRIS QS data spanning 19 minutes over
a 54.40"$\times$55.23" FOV yields 2997 detections. 1340 of these either remain un-fragmented
or fragment to two distinct regions at least once during their lifetime equating to an event density
of $3.96\times10^{-4}$arcsec$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$. The method will be used for a future large-scale
statistical analysis of several QS data sets from IRIS, other EUV imagers, as well as H-$\alpha$
and visible photospheric imagery.

Galaxy internal structure growth has long been accused of inhibiting star formation in disc galaxies.
We investigate the potential physical connection between the growth of dispersion-supported
stellar structures (e.g. classical bulges) and the position of galaxies on the star-forming main
sequence at $z\sim0$. Combining the might of the SAMI and MaNGA galaxy surveys, we measure the $\lambda_{Re}$
spin parameter for 3781 galaxies over $9.5 < \log M_{\star} [\rm{M}_{\odot}] < 12$. At all stellar
masses, galaxies at the locus of the main sequence possess $\lambda_{Re}$ values indicative of
intrinsically flattened discs. However, above $\log M_{\star}[\rm{M}_{\odot}]\sim10.5$ where
the main sequence starts bending, we find tantalising evidence for an increase in the number of galaxies
with dispersion-supported structures, perhaps suggesting a connection between bulges and the
bending of the main sequence. Moving above the main sequence, we see no evidence of any change in the
typical spin parameter in galaxies once gravitationally-interacting systems are excluded from
the sample. Similarly, up to 1 dex below the main sequence, $\lambda_{Re}$ remains roughly constant
and only at very high stellar masses ($\log M_{\star}[\rm{M}_{\odot}]>11$), do we see a rapid decrease
in $\lambda_{Re}$ once galaxies decline in star formation activity. If this trend is confirmed,
it would be indicative of different quenching mechanisms acting on high- and low-mass galaxies.
The results suggest that while a population of galaxies possessing some dispersion-supported
structure is already present on the star-forming main sequence, further growth would be required
after the galaxy has quenched to match the kinematic properties observed in passive galaxies at
$z\sim0$.

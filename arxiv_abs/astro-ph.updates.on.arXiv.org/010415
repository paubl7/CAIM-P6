The composition of rocky exoplanets in the context of stars' composition provides important constraints
to formation theories. In this study, we select a sample of exoplanets with mass and radius measurements
with an uncertainty <25% and obtain their interior structure. We calculate compositional markers,
ratios of iron to magnesium and silicon, as well as core-mass fractions (cmf) that fit the planetary
parameters, and compare them to the stars'. We find four key results that successful planet formation
theories need to predict: (1) In a population sense, the composition of rocky planets spans a wider
range than stars. The stars' Fe/Si distribution is close to a Gaussian distribution $1.63^{+0.91}_{-0.85}$,
while the planets' distribution peaks at lower values and has a longer tail, $1.15^{+1.43}_{-0.76}$.
It is easier to see the discrepancy in cmf space, where primordial stellar composition is $0.32^{+0.14}_{-0.12}$,
while rocky planets' follow a broader distribution $0.24^{+0.33}_{-0.18}$. (2) We introduce
uncompressed density ($\overline{\rho_0}$ at reference pressure/temperature) as a metric to
compare compositions. With this, we find what seems to be the maximum iron enrichment that rocky
planets attain during formation ($\overline{\rho_0}$ ~ 6 and cmf ~ 0.8). (3) Highly irradiated
planets exhibit a large range of compositions. If these planets are the result of atmospheric evaporation,
iron enrichment and perhaps depletion must happen before gas dispersal. And (4), we identify a group
of highly-irradiated planets that, if rocky, would be 2-fold depleted in Fe/Si with respect to the
stars. Without a reliable theory for forming iron-depleted planets, these are interesting targets
for follow up.

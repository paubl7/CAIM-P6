The effects in the local U-V velocity field due to orbital trapping by bar resonances have been studied
computing fifteen resonant families in a non-axisymmetric Galactic potential, considering the
bar's angular velocity between 35 and 57.5 ${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$. Only cases in the low,
37.5, 40 ${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$, and high, 55, 57.5 ${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$,
velocity ranges give trapping structures that have some similarity with observed features in the
velocity distribution. The resulting structures in the local U-V plane form resonant bands appearing
at various levels in velocity V. Cases with angular velocity 40 and 55 ${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$
show the greatest similarity with observed branches. Our best approximation to the local velocity
field by orbital trapping is obtained with a bar angular velocity of 40 ${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}{kpc}^{-1}}$
and a bar angle of 40${^\circ}$. With this solution, three main observed features can be approximated:
i) the Hercules branch at V=$-50$ ${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}}$ produced by the resonance 8/1 outside corotation,
and the close features produced by resonances 5/1 and 6/1, ii) the newly detected low-density arch
at V $\simeq$ 40 ${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}}$ produced approximately by the resonance 4/3, iii) the inclined
structure below the Hercules branch, also observed in the $\textit{Gaia}$ DR2 data, produced by
tube orbits around Lagrange point $L_5$ at corotation. Some predicted contributions due to orbital
trapping in regions of the U-V plane corresponding to the Galactic halo are given, which could help
to further restrict the value of the angular velocity of the Galactic bar. No support by orbital trapping
is found for the Arcturus stream at V $\approx$ $-100$ ${\rm\,km\,s^{-1}}$.

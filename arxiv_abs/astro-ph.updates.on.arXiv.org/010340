In this paper we present a statistical study of the kinematics of 28894 coronal mass ejections (CMEs)
recorded by the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO) on board the Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory spacecraft from 1996 until mid-2017. The initial acceleration phase is characterized
by a rapid increase in CME velocity just after eruption in the inner corona. This phase is followed
by a non-significant residual acceleration (deceleration) characterized by an almost constant
speed of CMEs. We demonstrate that the initial acceleration is in the range 0.24-2616 ms-2 with median
(average) value of 57 ms-2 (34 ms-2 ) and it takes place up to a distance of about 28 solar radius with
median (average) value of 7.8 solar radius (6 solar radius). Additionally, the initial acceleration
is significant in the case of fast CMEs (V > 900 kms-1 ), where the median (average) values are about
295 ms-2 (251 ms-2 ), respectively, and much weaker in the case of slow CMEs (V < 250 kms-1 ), where the
median (average) values are about 18 ms-2 (17 ms-2 ), respectively. We note that the significant
driving force (Lorentz force) can operate up to a distance of 6 solar radius from the Sun during the
first 2 hours of propagation. We found a significant anti-correlation between the initial acceleration
magnitude and the acceleration duration, whereas the residual acceleration covers a range from
-1224 to 0 ms-2 with a median (average) value of -34 ms-2 (-17 ms-2 ). One intriguing finding is that
the residual acceleration is much smaller during the 24th cycle in comparison to the 23rd cycle of
solar activity. Our study has also revealed that the considered parameters, initial acceleration
(ACC INI ), residual acceleration (ACC RES ), maximum velocity (V MAX ), and time at maximum velocity
(Time MAX ) mostly follow solar cycles and the intensities of the individual cycle.

Thanks to modern understanding of stellar evolution, we can accurately measure the age of Open Clusters
(OCs). Given their position, they are ideal tracers of the Galactic disc. Gaia data release 2, besides
providing precise parallaxes, led to the detection of many new clusters, opening a new era for the
study of the Galactic disc. However, detailed information on the chemical abundance for OCs is necessary
to accurately date them and to efficiently use them to probe the evolution of the disc.Mapping and
exploring the Milky Way structure %to combine accurate chemical information of OCs is the main aim
of the Stellar Population Astrophysics (SPA) project. Part of this work involves the use of OCs and
the derivation of their precise and accurate chemical composition.We analyze here a sample of OCs
located within about 2 kpc from the Sun, with ages from about 50 Myr to a few Gyr.We used HARPS-N at the
Telescopio Nazionale Gaileo and collected very high-resolution spectra (R = 115\,000) of 40 red
giant/red clump stars in 18 OCs (16 never or scarcely studied plus two comparison clusters). We measured
their radial velocities and derived the stellar parameters.We discussed the relationship between
metallicity and Galactocentric distance, adding literature data to our results to enlarge the
sample and taking also age into account. We compared the result of observational data with that from
chemo-dynamical models. These models generally reproduce the metallicity gradient well. However,
at young ages we found a large dispersion in metallicity, not reproduced by models. Several possible
explanations are explored, including uncertainties in the derived metallicity. We confirm the
difficulties in determining parameters for young stars (age < 200 Myr), due to a combination of intrinsic
factors which atmospheric models can not easily reproduce and which affect the parameters uncertainty

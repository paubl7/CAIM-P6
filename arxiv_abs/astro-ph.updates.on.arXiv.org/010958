We study populations of soft and super-soft X-ray sources in nearby galaxies of various morphological
types with the special emphasis on characterizing populations of stable nuclear burning accreting
WDs. Analysing the content of Chandra archive we assembled a sample of nearby galaxies suitable
for studying populations of super-soft X-ray sources. Our sample includes 4 spiral galaxies, 2
lenticular galaxies and 3 ellipticals with stellar mass exceeding $10^{10}$ $M_\odot$ and X-ray
sensitivity of the order of a ${\rm few}\times 10^{36}$ erg/s. We used combination of hardness ratio
and median energy to pre-select X-ray sources with soft spectra, and temperature - X-ray luminosity
diagram to identify super-soft X-ray sources - likely nuclear burning accreting white dwarfs.
For spiral galaxies, there is a distinct and rare population of super-soft sources, largely detached
from the rest of sources on the $kT_{bb}-L_X$ plane. The boundary between these sources and the much
more numerous population of harder (but still soft) sources is consistent with the boundary of stable
hydrogen burning on the white dwarf surface. Combined spectrum of soft sources located outside
this boundary, shows clear emission lines of Mg and S, which equivalent width is similar to that in
the combined spectrum of a large number of confirmed supernova remnants in M83. This confirms earlier
suggestions that the vast majority of so called quasi-soft sources are supernova remnants. In early-type
galaxies, populations of super-soft sources are about a factor of $\approx 8$ less abundant, in
broad agreement with the population synthesis calculations. Specific frequencies of super-soft
sources are: (2.08$\pm$0.46)$\times10^{-10}$ M$_{\odot}^{-1}$ in spiral galaxies and (2.47$\pm$1.34)$\times10^{-11}$
M$_{\odot}^{-1}$ in lenticular and elliptical galaxies, with the ratio of the latter to the former
of $0.12\pm0.05$.

The vast quantity of strong galaxy-galaxy gravitational lenses expected by future large-scale
surveys necessitates the development of automated methods to efficiently model their mass profiles.
For this purpose, we train an approximate Bayesian convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict
mass profile parameters and associated uncertainties, and compare its accuracy to that of conventional
parametric modelling for a range of increasingly complex lensing systems. These include standard
smooth parametric density profiles, hydrodynamical EAGLE galaxies and the inclusion of foreground
mass structures, combined with parametric sources and sources extracted from the Hubble Ultra
Deep Field. In addition, we also present a method for combining the CNN with traditional parametric
density profile fitting where the CNN provides initial priors on the latter's parameters. Across
the test sets of images, the CNN achieved errors 19 $\pm$ 22 per cent lower than the traditional method's
blind modelling. Using these CNN-predicted parameters as priors for this method to use in an automated
fashion instead achieved 27 $\pm$ 11 per cent lower errors over the latter. This was reduced further
to 37 $\pm$ 11 per cent when also incorporating the CNN-predicted uncertainties into the priors,
helping it to avoid local minima in parameter space, with errors also 17 $\pm$ 21 per cent lower than
the CNN by itself. While the CNN is undoubtedly the fastest modelling method, the combination of
the two increases the speed of conventional fitting alone by a factor of 1.73 and 1.19 with and without
CNN-predicted uncertainties, respectively. This, combined with greatly improved accuracy,
highlights the benefits one can obtain through combining neural networks with conventional techniques
in order to achieve an efficient automated modelling approach.

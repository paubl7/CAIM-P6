Nearby galaxies offer unique laboratories allowing multi-wavelength spatially resolved studies
of the interstellar medium, star formation and nuclear activity across a broad range of physical
conditions. In particular, detailed studies of individual local luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs)
are crucial for gaining a better understanding of these processes and for developing and testing
models that are used to explain statistical studies of large populations of such galaxies at high
redshift for which it is currently impossible to reach a sufficient physical resolution. Here,
we provide an overview of the impact of spatially resolved infrared, sub-millimetre and radio observations
in the study of the interstellar medium, star formation and active galactic nuclei as well as their
interplay in local LIRGs. We also present an overview of the modelling of their spectral energy distributions
using state-of-the-art radiative transfer codes. These contribute necessary and powerful 'workhorse'
tools for the study of LIRGs (and their more luminous counterparts) at higher redshifts which are
unresolved in observations. We describe how spatially-resolved time domain observations have
recently opened a new window to study the nuclear activity in LIRGs. We describe in detail the observational
characteristics of Arp 299 which is one of the best studied local LIRGs and exemplifies the power
of the combination of high-resolution observations at infrared to radio wavelengths together
with radiative transfer modelling used to explain the spectral energy distributions of its different
components. We summarise the previous achievements obtained using high-spatial resolution observations
and provide an outlook into what we can expect to achieve with future facilities.

How global faculae and network coverage relates to that of sunspots is relevant to the brightness
variations of the Sun and Sun-like stars. We extend earlier studies that found the facular-to-sunspot-area
ratio diminishes with total sunspot coverage. Chromospheric indices and the total magnetic flux
enclosed in network and faculae, referred to here as 'facular indices', are modulated by the amount
of facular and network present. We probed the relationship between various facular and sunspot
indices through an empirical model that takes into account how active regions evolve. This model
was incorporated into a total solar irradiance (TSI) model. The model presented here replicates
most of the observed variability in the facular indices, and is better at doing so than earlier models.
Contrary to recent studies, we found the relationship between the facular and sunspot indices to
be stable over the past four decades. The model indicates that, like the facular-to-sunspot-area
ratio, the ratio of the variation in chromospheric emission and total network and facular magnetic
flux to sunspot area decreases with the latter. The TSI model indicates the ratio of the TSI excess
from faculae and network to the deficit from sunspots also declines with sunspot area, with the consequence
being that TSI rises with sunspot area more slowly than if the two quantities were linearly proportional
to one another. The extrapolation of the TSI model to higher activity levels indicates that in the
activity range where Sun-like stars are observed to switch from growing brighter with increasing
activity to becoming dimmer instead, the activity-dependence of TSI exhibits a similar transition
as sunspot darkening starts to rise more rapidly with activity than facular brightening. This bolsters
the interpretation of this behavior of Sun-like stars as the transition from a faculae-dominated
to a spot-dominated regime.

The study of the magnification bias produced on high-redshift sub-millimetre galaxies by foreground
galaxies through the analysis of the cross-correlation function was recently demonstrated as
an interesting independent alternative to the weak-lensing shear as a cosmological probe. In the
case of the proposed observable, most of the cosmological constraints mainly depend on the largest
angular separation measurements. Therefore, we aim to study and correct the main large-scale biases
that affect foreground and background galaxy samples to produce a robust estimation of the cross-correlation
function. Then we analyse the corrected signal to derive updated cosmological constraintsWe measured
the large-scale, bias-corrected cross-correlation functions using a background sample of H-ATLAS
galaxies with photometric redshifts > 1.2 and two different foreground samples (GAMA galaxies
with spectroscopic redshifts or SDSS galaxies with photometric ones, both in the range 0.2 < z < 0.8).
These measurements are modelled using the traditional halo model description that depends on both
halo occupation distribution and cosmological parameters. We then estimated these parameters
by performing a Markov chain Monte Carlo under multiple scenarios to study the performance of this
observable and how to improve its results. After the large-scale bias corrections, we obtain only
minor improvements with respect to the previous magnification bias results, mainly confirming
their conclusions: a lower bound on $\Omega_m > 0.22$ at $95\%$ C.L. and an upper bound $\sigma_8
< 0.97$ at $95\%$ C.L. (results from the $z_{spec}$ sample). However, by combining both foreground
samples into a simplified tomographic analysis, we were able to obtain interesting constraints
on the $\Omega_m$-$\sigma_8$ plane as follows: $\Omega_m= 0.50_{- 0.20}^{+ 0.14}$ and $\sigma_8=
0.75_{- 0.10}^{+ 0.07}$ at 68\% CL.

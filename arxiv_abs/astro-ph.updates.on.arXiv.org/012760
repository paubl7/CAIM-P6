High-resolution optical spectra of 30 metal-poor stars selected from the \Pristine\ survey are
presented, based on observations taken with the Gemini Observatory GRACES spectrograph. Stellar
parameters \teff and \logg are determined using a Gaia DR2 colour-temperature calibration and
surface gravity from the Stefan-Boltzmann equation. GRACES spectra are used to determine chemical
abundances (or upper-limits) for 20 elements (Li, O, Na, Mg, K, Ca, Ti, Sc, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Y,
Zr, Ba, La, Nd, Eu). These stars are confirmed to be metal-poor ([Fe/H]$<-2.5$), with higher precision
than from earlier medium-resolution analyses. The chemistry for most targets is similar to other
extremely metal-poor stars in the Galactic halo. Three stars near [Fe/H]$=-3.0$ have unusually
low Ca and high Mg, suggestive of contributions from few SN~II where alpha-element formation through
hydrostatic nucleosynthesis was more efficient. Three new carbon-enhanced metal-poor stars
are also identified (two CEMP-s and one potential CEMP-no star) when our chemical abundances are
combined with carbon from previous medium-resolution analyses. The GRACES spectra also provide
precision radial velocities ($\sigma_{\rm RV}\le0.2$km\,s$^{-1}$) for dynamical orbit calculations
with the Gaia DR2 proper motions. Most of our targets are dynamically associated with the Galactic
halo; however, five stars with [Fe/H]$<-3$ have planar-like orbits, including one retrograde
star. Another five stars are dynamically consistent with the Gaia-Sequoia accretion event; three
have typical halo [$\alpha$/Fe] ratios for their metallicities, whereas two are [Mg/Fe]-deficient,
and one is a new CEMP-s candidate. These results are discussed in terms of the formation and early
chemical evolution of the Galaxy.

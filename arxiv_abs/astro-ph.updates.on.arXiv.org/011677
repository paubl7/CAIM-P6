For decades, AE Aquarii (AE Aqr) has been the only cataclysmic variable star known to contain a magnetic
propeller: a persistent outflow whose expulsion from the binary is powered by the spin-down of the
rapidly rotating, magnetized white dwarf. In 2020, LAMOST-J024048.51+195226.9 (J0240) was identified
as a candidate eclipsing AE Aqr object, and we present three epochs of time-series spectroscopy
that strongly support this hypothesis. We show that during the photometric flares noted by Thorstensen
(arXiv:2007.09285), the half-width-at-zero-intensity of the Balmer and HeI lines routinely
reaches a maximum of ~3000 km/s, well in excess of what is observed in normal cataclysmic variables.
This is, however, consistent with the high-velocity emission seen in flares from AE Aqr. Additionally,
we confirm beyond doubt that J0240 is a deeply eclipsing system. The flaring continuum, HeI and much
of the Balmer emission likely originate close to the WD because they disappear during the eclipse
that is centered on inferior conjunction of the secondary star. The fraction of the Balmer emission
remaining visible during eclipse has a steep decrement and it is likely produced in the extended
outflow. Most enticingly of all, this outflow produces a narrow P-Cyg absorption component for
nearly half of the orbit, and we demonstrate that this scenario closely matches the outflow kinematics
predicted by Wynn, King, & Horne. While an important piece of evidence for the magnetic-propeller
hypothesis---a rapid WD spin period---remains elusive, our spectra provide compelling support
for the existence of a propeller-driven outflow viewed nearly edge-on, enabling a new means of rigorously
testing theories of the propeller phenomenon.

The process of momentum and energy transfer from a massive body moving through a background medium,
known as dynamical friction (DF), is key to our understanding of many astrophysical systems. We
present a series of high-resolution simulations of gaseous DF using Lagrangian hydrodynamics
solvers, in the state-of-the-art multi-physics code, GIZMO. The numerical setup is chosen to allow
direct comparison to analytic predictions for DF in the range of Mach 0.2<M<3. We investigate, in
detail, the DF drag force, the radial structure of the wake, and their time evolution. The subsonic
forces are shown to be well resolved, except at Mach numbers close to M=1. The supersonic cases, close
to M=1, significantly under-shoot the predicted force. We find that for scenarios with 0.7<M<2,
between 10%-50% of the expected DF force is missing. The origin of this deficit is mostly related
to the wake structure close to the perturber, where the density profile of the Mach cone face shows
significant smoothing, which does not improve with time. The spherical expanding perturbation
of the medium is captured well by the hydro scheme, but it is the sharp density structure, at the transition
from Mach cone to average density, that introduces the mismatch. However, we find a general improvement
of the force deficit with time, though significant differencesremain, in agreement with other
studies. This is due to (1) the structure of the far field wake being reproduced well, and (2) the fraction
of total drag from the far field wake increasing with time. Dark matter sub-haloes, in typical cosmological
simulations, occupy parameters similar to those tested here, suggesting that the DF which these
sub-haloes experience is significantly underestimated, and hence their merger rate. Dynamical
friction is a relevant benchmark and should be included as one of the standard hydro tests for astrophysical
simulations.

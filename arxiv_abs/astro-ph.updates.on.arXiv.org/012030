Studies of close-in planets orbiting M dwarfs have suggested that the M dwarf radius valley may be
well-explained by distinct formation timescales between enveloped terrestrials, and rocky planets
that form at late times in a gas-depleted environment. This scenario is at odds with the picture that
close-in rocky planets form with a primordial gaseous envelope that is subsequently stripped away
by some thermally-driven mass loss process. These two physical scenarios make unique predictions
of the rocky/enveloped transition's dependence on orbital separation such that studying the compositions
of planets within the M dwarf radius valley may be able to establish the dominant physics. Here, we
present the discovery of one such keystone planet: the ultra-short period planet TOI-1634 b ($P=0.989$
days, $F=121 F_{\oplus}$, $r_p = 1.790^{+0.080}_{-0.081} R_{\oplus}$) orbiting a nearby M2 dwarf
($K_s=8.7$, $R_s=0.45 R_{\odot}$, $M_s=0.50 M_{\odot}$) and whose size and orbital period sit
within the M dwarf radius valley. We confirm the TESS-discovered planet candidate using extensive
ground-based follow-up campaigns, including a set of 32 precise radial velocity measurements
from HARPS-N. We measure a planetary mass of $4.91^{+0.68}_{-0.70} M_{\oplus}$, which makes TOI-1634
b inconsistent with an Earth-like composition at $5.9\sigma$ and thus requires either an extended
gaseous envelope, a large volatile-rich layer, or a rocky portion that is not dominated by iron and
silicates to explain its mass and radius. The discovery that the bulk composition of TOI-1634 b is
inconsistent with that of the Earth favors the gas-depleted formation mechanism to explain the
emergence of the radius valley around M dwarfs with $M_s\lesssim 0.5 M_{\odot}$.

We present near-IR photometry and spectroscopy of 30 extremely luminous radio and mid-IR selected
galaxies. With bolometric luminosities exceeding $\sim10^{13}$ $\rm{L_{\odot}}$ and redshifts
ranging from $z = 0.880-2.853$, we use VLT instruments X-shooter and ISAAC to investigate this unique
population of galaxies. Broad multi-component emission lines are detected in 18 galaxies and we
measure the near-IR lines $\rm{H\rm{\beta}}$, $\text{[OIII]}\rm{\lambda}\rm{\lambda}4959,5007$
and $\rm{H\rm{\alpha}}$ in six, 15 and 13 galaxies respectively, with 10 $\rm{Ly\alpha}$ and five
CIV lines additionally detected in the UVB arm. We use the broad $\text{[OIII]}\rm{\lambda}5007$
emission lines as a proxy for the bolometric AGN luminosity, and derive lower limits to supermassive
black hole masses of $10^{7.9}$-$10^{9.4}$ $\text{M}_{\odot}$ with expectations of corresponding
host masses of $10^{10.4}$-$10^{12.0}$ $\text{M}_{\odot}$. We measure $\rm{\lambda}_{Edd}$
> 1 for eight of these sources at a $2\sigma$ significance. Near-IR photometry and SED fitting are
used to compare stellar masses directly. We detect both Balmer lines in five galaxies and use these
to infer a mean visual extinction of $A_{V}$ = 2.68 mag. Due to non-detections and uncertainties
in our $\rm{H\rm{\beta}}$ emission line measurements, we simulate a broad $\rm{H\rm{\beta}}$
line of FWHM = 1480 $\rm{kms^{-1}}$ to estimate extinction for all sources with measured $\rm{H\rm{\alpha}}$
emission. We then use this to infer a mean $A_{V}=3.62$ mag, demonstrating the highly-obscured
nature of these galaxies, with the consequence of increasing our estimates of black-hole masses
by an 0.5 orders of magnitude in the most extreme and obscured cases.

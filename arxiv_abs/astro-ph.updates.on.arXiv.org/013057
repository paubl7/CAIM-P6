Recent cosmic-ray (CR) studies have claimed the possibility of an excess on the antiproton flux
over the predicted models at around $10$ GeV, which can be the signature of dark matter annihilating
into hadronic final states that subsequently form antiprotons. However, this excess is subject
to many uncertainties related to the evaluation of the antiproton spectrum produced from spallation
interactions of CRs. In this work, we implement a combined Markov-Chain Monte Carlo analysis of
the secondary ratios of B, Be and Li and the antiproton-to-proton ratio ($\bar{p}/p$), while also
including nuisance parameters to consider the uncertainties related to the spallation cross sections.
This study allows us to constrain the Galactic halo height and the rest of propagation parameters,
evaluate the impact of cross sections uncertainties in the determination of the antiproton spectrum
and test the origin of the excess of antiprotons. In this way, we provide a set of propagation parameters
and scale factors for renormalizing the cross sections parametrizations that allow us to reproduce
all the ratios of B, Be, Li and $\bar{p}$ simultaneously. We show that the energy dependence of the
$\bar{p}/p$ ratio is compatible with a pure secondary origin. We find that the energy dependence
of the evaluated $\bar{p}/p$ spectrum matches the AMS-02 data at energies above $\sim3$GeV, although
there is still a nearly constant $\sim10\%$ excess of $\bar{p}$ over our prediction. We discuss
that this discrepancy is more likely explained from a $\sim10\%$ scaling in the cross sections of
antiproton production, rather than a component of dark matter leading to antiprotons. In particular,
we find that the best-fit WIMP mass ($\sim 300$ GeV) needed to explain the discrepancy lies above
the constraints from most indirect searches of dark matter and the resultant fit is poorer than with
a cross sections scaling.

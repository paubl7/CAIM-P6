The evolution of young stars and disks is driven by the interplay of several processes, notably accretion
and ejection of material. Critical to correctly describe the conditions of planet formation, these
processes are best probed spectroscopically. About five-hundred orbits of the Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) are being devoted in 2020-2022 to the ULLYSES public survey of about 70 low-mass (M<2Msun)
young (age<10 Myr) stars at UV wavelengths. Here we present the PENELLOPE Large Program that is being
carried out at the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT) to acquire, contemporaneous to HST, optical ESPRESSO/UVES
high-resolution spectra to investigate the kinematics of the emitting gas, and UV-to-NIR X-Shooter
medium-resolution flux-calibrated spectra to provide the fundamental parameters that HST data
alone cannot provide, such as extinction and stellar properties. The data obtained by PENELLOPE
have no proprietary time, and the fully reduced spectra are made available to the whole community.
Here, we describe the data and the first scientific analysis of the accretion properties for the
sample of thirteen targets located in the Orion OB1 association and in the sigma-Orionis cluster,
observed in Nov-Dec 2020. We find that the accretion rates are in line with those observed previously
in similarly young star-forming regions, with a variability on a timescale of days of <3. The comparison
of the fits to the continuum excess emission obtained with a slab model on the X-Shooter spectra and
the HST/STIS spectra shows a shortcoming in the X-Shooter estimates of <10%, well within the assumed
uncertainty. Its origin can be either a wrong UV extinction curve or due to the simplicity of this
modelling, and will be investigated in the course of the PENELLOPE program. The combined ULLYSES
and PENELLOPE data will be key for a better understanding of the accretion/ejection mechanisms
in young stars.

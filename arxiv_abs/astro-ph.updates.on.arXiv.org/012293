We present self-consistent, 3D core-collapse supernova simulations of a 40 Msun progenitor model
using the isotropic diffusion source approximation for neutrino transport and an effective general
relativistic potential up to $\sim0.9$~s~postbounce. We consider three different rotational
speeds with initial angular velocities of $\Omega_0=0$,~0.5, and~1~rad~s$^{-1}$ and investigate
the impact of rotation on shock dynamics, black hole formation, and gravitational wave signals.
The rapidly-rotating model undergoes an early explosion at $\sim 250$~ms postbounce and shows
signs of the low $T/|W|$ instability. We do not find black hole formation in this model within $\sim
460$~ms postbounce. In contrast, we find black hole formation at 776~ms~postbounce and 936~ms~postbounce
for the non-rotating and slowly-rotating models, respectively. The slowly-rotating model explodes
at $\sim 650$~ms postbounce, and the subsequent fallback accretion onto the proto-neutron star
(PNS) results in BH formation. In addition, the standing~accretion~shock~instability induces
rotation of the proto-neutron star in the model that started with a non-rotating progenitor. Assuming
conservation of specific angular momentum during black hole formation, this corresponds to a black~hole
spin parameter of $a=J/M=0.046$. However, if no explosion sets in, all the angular momentum will
eventually be accreted by the BH, resulting in a non-spinning BH. The successful explosion of the
slowly-rotating model drastically slows down the accretion onto the PNS, allowing continued cooling
and contraction that results in an extremely high gravitational-wave frequency ($f\sim3000$~Hz)
at black~hole formation, while the non-rotating model generates gravitational wave signals similar
to our corresponding 2D simulations.

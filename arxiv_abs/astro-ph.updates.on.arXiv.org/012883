The eROSITA Final Equatorial-Depth Survey (eFEDS), covering ~140 square degrees, was performed
as part of the performance verification phase of the eROSITA telescope on board of the Russian-German
satellite Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG). In this paper we present the optical follow-up of 542
X-ray extent selected galaxy group and cluster candidates providing redshifts and cluster confirmation
for the full sample. We use optical imaging data from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic Program
and from the Legacy Survey to run the cluster redshift and confirmation tool MCMF as well as the optical
cluster finder CAMIRA at the location of the X-ray candidates. While providing redshift estimates
for all 542 candidates, we construct an optically confirmed sample of 477 clusters and groups with
a residual contamination of 6%. Of these, 470 (98.5%) are confirmed using MCMF and 7 systems are added
through cross matching with spectroscopic group catalogs. Using observable to observable scaling
and the applied confirmation threshold, we predict 8 +/- 2 real systems have been excluded with the
MCMF cut required to build this low contamination sample. This number is in good agreement with the
7 systems recovered through cross matching. Thus, we expect those 477 systems to include >99% of
all true clusters in the candidate list. Using an MCMF independent method, we confirm the catalog
contamination of the confirmed subsample to be 6 +/- 3% and find 17 +/- 3% contamination for the full
X-ray sample. The estimated contamination of the fulls sample is in agreement with MCMF dependent
estimate of ~17% and the expectation from dedicated X-ray simulations of ~20%. We further present
a sample of optically selected merging cluster candidates.

We perform a series of three-dimensional, magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of star cluster
formation including gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, stellar radiative heating and outflow
feedback. We observe that the inclusion of protostellar outflows (1) reduces the star formation
rate by a factor of $\sim2$, (2) increases fragmentation, and (3) shifts the initial mass function
(IMF) to lower masses by a factor of $2.0\pm0.2$, without significantly affecting the overall shape
of the IMF. The form of the sink particle (protostellar objects) mass distribution obtained from
our simulations matches the observational IMFs reasonably well. We also show that turbulence-based
theoretical models of the IMF agree well with our simulation IMF in the high-mass and low-mass regime,
but do not predict any brown dwarfs, whereas our simulations produce a considerable number of sub-stellar
objects, which are produced by dynamical interactions (ejections). We find that these dynamical
interactions also play a key role for the binary separation distribution and stellar kinematics
in general. Our numerical model of star cluster formation also reproduces the observed mass dependence
of multiplicity. Our multiplicity fraction estimates generally concur with the observational
estimates for different spectral types. We further calculate the specific angular momentum of
all the sink particles and find that the average value of $1.5 \times 10^{19}\, \mathrm{cm^2\, s^{-1}}$
is consistent with observational data. The specific angular momentum of our sink particles lies
in the range typical of protostellar envelopes and binaries. We conclude that the IMF is controlled
by a combination of gravity, turbulence, magnetic fields, radiation and outflow feedback.

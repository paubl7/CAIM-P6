The goal of this work is to study magnetic fields of the cool, eclipsing binary star UV Piscium (UV
Psc). This system contains two active late-type stars, UV Psc A (G5V) and B (K3V). To obtain a complete
picture, the properties of both global and local magnetic field structures are studied for both
components. High-resolution intensity and circular polarisation spectra, collected in 2016
with the ESPaDOnS spectropolarimeter at the CFHT, were used to analyse the magnetic field of UV Psc.
To increase the signal-to-noise ratio, the multi-line technique of least-squares deconvolution
(LSD) was used to obtain average Stokes IV profiles. Then, a Zeeman-Doppler imaging (ZDI) code was
employed to obtain the large-scale magnetic field topology and brightness distribution for both
components of UV Psc. In addition, the small-scale magnetic fields, not visible to ZDI, were studied
using the Zeeman intensification of Fe I lines. Maps of the surface magnetic field for both components
of UV Psc were obtained, the large-scale magnetic fields feature strong toroidal and non-axisymetric
components. UV Psc A and B have average global field strengths of 137 G and 88 G, respectively. The
small-scale fields are notably stronger, with average strengths of 2.5 and 2.2 kG, respectively.
Our results are in agreement with previous studies of partly-convective stars. Overall, UV Psc
A has a stronger magnetic field compared to UV Psc B. Due to the eclipsing binary geometry, certain
magnetic field features are not detectable using circular polarisation only. An investigation
into theoretical linear polarisation profiles shows that they could be used to reveal antisymmetric
components of the magnetic field. This result also has implications for the study of exoplanetary
transit hosts.

Although ZwCl0024+1652 galaxy cluster at $z\sim0.4$ has been thoroughly analysed, it lacks a comprehensive
study of star formation and nuclear activity of its members. With GaLAxy Cluster Evolution (GLACE)
survey, a total of 174 H$\alpha$ emission-line galaxies (ELGs) were detected, most of them having
[NII}]. We reduced and analysed a set of [OIII] and H$\beta$ tunable filter (TF) observations within
GLACE survey. Using H$\alpha$ priors, we identified [OIII] and H$\beta$ in 35 ($\sim$20%) and 59
($\sim$34%) sources, respectively, with 21 of them having both emission lines, and 20 having in
addition [NII]. Applying BPT-NII diagnostic diagram, we classified these ELGs into 40% star-forming
(SF), 55% composites, and 5% LINERs. Star formation rate (SFR) measured through extinction corrected
H$\alpha$ fluxes increases with stellar mass ($\mathrm{M}_{*}$), attaining its peak at $\mathrm{M}_{*}\sim10^{9.8}\mathrm{M}_\odot$.
We observed that the cluster centre to $\sim$1.3Mpc is devoid of SF galaxies and AGN. Our results
suggest that the star formation efficiency declines as the local density increases in the cluster
medium. Moreover, the SF and AGN fractions drop sharply towards high-density environments. We
observed a strong decline in SF fraction in high $\mathrm{M}_*$, confirming that star formation
is highly suppressed in high-mass cluster galaxies. Finally, we determined that SFR correlates
with $\mathrm{M}_*$ while specific SFR (sSFR) anti-correlates with $\mathrm{M}_*$, both for
cluster and field. This work shows the importance and strength of TF observations when studying
ELGs in clusters at higher redshifts. We provide with this paper a catalogue of ELGs with H$\beta$
and/or [OIII] lines in ZwCl0024+1652 cluster.

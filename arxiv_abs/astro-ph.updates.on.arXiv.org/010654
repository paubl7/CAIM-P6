We present a statistical analysis of the gravoturbulent velocity fluctuations in molecular cloud
complexes extracted from our "Cloud Factory" galactic-scale ISM simulation suite. For this purpose,
we produce non-LTE $^{12}$CO J=1-0 synthetic observations and apply the Principal Component Analysis
(PCA) reduction technique on a representative sample of cloud complexes. The velocity fluctuations
are self-consistently generated by different physical mechanisms at play in our simulations,
which include galactic-scale forces, gas self-gravity, and supernova feedback. The statistical
analysis suggests that, even though purely gravitational effects are necessary to reproduce standard
observational laws, they are not sufficient in most cases. We show that the extra injection of energy
from supernova explosions plays a key role in establishing the global turbulent field and the local
dynamics and morphology of molecular clouds. Additionally, we characterise structure function
scaling parameters as a result of cloud environmental conditions: some of the complexes are immersed
in diffuse (inter-arm) or dense (spiral-arm) environments, and others are influenced by embedded
or external supernovae. In quiescent regions, we obtain time-evolving trajectories of scaling
parameters driven by gravitational collapse and supersonic turbulent flows. Our findings suggests
that a PCA-based statistical study is a robust method to diagnose the physical mechanisms that drive
the gravoturbulent properties of molecular clouds. Also, we present a new open source module, the
PCAFACTORY, which smartly performs PCA to extract velocity structure functions from simulated
or real data of the ISM in a user-friendly way. Software DOI: 10.5281/zenodo.3822718

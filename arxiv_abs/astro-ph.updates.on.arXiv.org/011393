We present new spectroscopic and polarimetric observations of the first discovered gravitational
lens Q0957+561 obtained with the 6m telescope of the Special Astrophysical Observatory (SAO, Russia).
We explore spectropolarimetric parameters of Q0957+561 A,B components to investigate the innermost
structure of the quasar, and explore the nature of polarization in lensed quasars. Additionally,
we compare their present-day spectral characteristics with previous observations in order to
study long-term spectral changes. We analyze spectral characteristics of lensed quasar comparing
spectra of A and B images, as well as comparing previously observed image spectra with present-day
ones. The polarization parameters of A-B images are compared. We also model the macro-lens influence
on the polarization of the images representing the gravitational lens with a singular isothermal
elliptical potential. We find that the brightness and SED ratio of components A and B changed during
a long period. Polarization in broad lines of components A and B showed that the equatorial scattering
cannot be detected in this quasar. We find wavelength-dependent polarization that may be explained
as a combination of the polarization from the disc and outflowing material. There is a significant
difference between polarization parameters of the A and B images: the B component shows a higher
polarization degree and polarization angle. However, both polarization vectors are nearly perpendicular
to the observed radio jet projection. It indicates that the polarization in the continuum is coming
from the accretion disc. Our simple lensing model of a polarized source showed that macro-lens can
cause the observed differences in polarization parameters of Q0957+561 A,B images. Using Mg II
broad line and luminosity of component A we estimated that the Q0957+561 black hole mass is M~(4.8-6.1)

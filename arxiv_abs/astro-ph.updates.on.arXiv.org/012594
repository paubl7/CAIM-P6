We use the Cosmic Assembly Deep Near-infrared Extragalactic Legacy Survey (CANDELS) data to study
the relationship between quenching and the stellar mass surface density within the central radius
of 1 kpc ($\Sigma_1$) of low-mass galaxies (stellar mass $M_* \lesssim 10^{9.5} M_\odot$) at $0.5
\leq z < 1.5$. Our sample is mass complete down to $\sim 10^9 M_\odot$ at $0.5 \leq z < 1.0$. We compare
the mean $\Sigma_1$ of star-forming galaxies (SFGs) and quenched galaxies (QGs) at the same redshift
and $M_*$. We find that low-mass QGs have higher $\Sigma_1$ than low-mass SFGs, similar to galaxies
above $10^{10} M_\odot$. The difference of $\Sigma_1$ between QGs and SFGs increases slightly
with $M_*$ at $M_* \lesssim 10^{10} M_\odot$ and decreases with $M_*$ at $M_* \gtrsim 10^{10} M_\odot$.
The turnover mass is consistent with the mass where quenching mechanisms transition from internal
to environmental quenching. At $0.5 \leq z < 1.0$, we find that the $\Sigma_1$ of galaxies increases
by about 0.25 dex in the green valley (i.e., the transitioning region from star forming to fully quenched),
regardless of their $M_*$. Using the observed specific star formation rate (sSFR) gradient in the
literature as a constraint, we estimate that the quenching timescale (i.e., time spent in the transition)
of low-mass galaxies is a few ($\sim4$) Gyrs at $0.5 \leq z < 1.0$. The mechanisms responsible for
quenching need to gradually quench star formation in an outside-in way, i.e., preferentially ceasing
star formation in outskirts of galaxies while maintaining their central star formation to increase
$\Sigma_1$. An interesting and intriguing result is the similarity of the growth of $\Sigma_1$
in the green valley between low-mass and massive galaxies, which suggests that the role of internal
processes in quenching low-mass galaxies is a question worthy of further investigation.

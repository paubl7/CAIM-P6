The central molecular zone (CMZ) plays an essential role in regulating the nuclear ecosystem of
our Galaxy. To get an insight into the magnetic fields of the CMZ, we employ the Gradient Technique
(GT), which is rooted in the anisotropy of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence. Our analysis is based
on the data of multiple wavelengths, including molecular emission lines, radio 1.4 GHz continuum
image, and Herschel 70 um image, as well as ionized [Ne II] and Paschen-alpha emissions. The results
are compared with the observations of Planck 353 GHz and High-resolution Airborne Wideband Camera
Plus (HWAC+) 53 um polarized dust emissions. We map the wavelength-dependent magnetic field orientation
across the central molecular zone, including close-ups of the Radio Arc and Sagittarius A West regions,
on multi scales from ~0.1 pc to 10 pc. The magnetic fields towards the central molecular zone traced
by GT are globally compatible with the polarization measurements, accounting for the contribution
from the galactic foreground and background. This correspondence suggests that the magnetic field
and turbulence are dynamically crucial in the galactic center. We find that the magnetic fields
associated with the Arched filaments and the thermal components of the Radio Arc are in good agreement
with the HAWC+ polarization. Our measurement towards the non-thermal Radio Arc reveals the poloidal
magnetic field components in the galactic center. For Sagittarius A West region, we find a great
agreement between the GT measurement using [Ne II] emission and HWAC+ 53 um observation. We use GT
to predict the magnetic fields associated with ionized Paschen-alpha gas down to scales of 0.1 pc.
These results demonstrate the potential power of GT in the high-resolution mapping of magnetic
fields and in decomposing contributions from different velocity components and/or different
gas phases.

We test the hypothesis that environments play a key role in enabling the growth of enormous radio
structures spanning more than 700 kpc, an extreme population of radio galaxies called giant radio
galaxies (GRGs). To achieve this, we explore (1) the relationships between the occurrence of GRGs
and the surface number density of surrounding galaxies, including satellite galaxies and galaxies
from neighboring halos, as well as (2) the GRG locations towards large-scale structures. The analysis
is done by making use of a homogeneous sample of 110 GRGs detected from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey
in combination with photometric galaxies from the DESI Legacy Imaging Surveys and a large-scale
filament catalog from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. Our results show that the properties of galaxies
around GRGs are similar with that around the two control samples, consisting of galaxies with optical
colors and luminosity matched to the properties of the GRG host galaxies. Additionally, the properties
of surrounding galaxies depend on neither their relative positions to the radio jet/lobe structures
nor the sizes of GRGs. We also find that the locations of GRGs and the control samples with respect
to the nearby large-scale structures are consistent with each other. These results demonstrate
that there is no correlation between the GRG properties and their environments traced by stars,
indicating that external galaxy environments are not the primary cause of the large sizes of the
radio structures. Finally, regarding radio feedback, we show that the fraction of blue satellites
does not correlate with the GRG properties, suggesting that the current epoch of radio jets have
minimal influence on the nature of their surrounding galaxies.

Observational astrophysics consists of making inferences about the Universe by comparing data
and models. The credible intervals placed on model parameters are often as important as the maximum
a posteriori probability values, as the intervals indicate concordance or discordance between
models and with measurements from other data. Intermediate statistics (e.g. the power spectrum)
are usually measured and inferences made by fitting models to these rather than the raw data, assuming
that the likelihood for these statistics has multivariate Gaussian form. The covariance matrix
used to calculate the likelihood is often estimated from simulations, such that it is itself a random
variable. This is a standard problem in Bayesian statistics, which requires a prior to be placed
on the true model parameters and covariance matrix, influencing the joint posterior distribution.
As an alternative to the commonly-used Independence-Jeffreys prior, we introduce a prior that
leads to a posterior that has approximately frequentist matching coverage. This is achieved by
matching the covariance of the posterior to that of the distribution of true values of the parameters
around the maximum likelihood values in repeated trials, under certain assumptions. Using this
prior, credible intervals derived from a Bayesian analysis can be interpreted approximately as
confidence intervals, containing the truth a certain proportion of the time for repeated trials.
Linking frequentist and Bayesian approaches that have previously appeared in the astronomical
literature, this offers a consistent and conservative approach for credible intervals quoted
on model parameters for problems where the covariance matrix is itself an estimate.

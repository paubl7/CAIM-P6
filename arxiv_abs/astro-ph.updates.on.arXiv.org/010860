One of the most significant revelations from Kepler is that roughly one-third of Sun-like stars
host planets which orbit their stars within 100 days and are between the size of Earth and Neptune.
How do these super-Earth and sub-Neptune planets form, what are they made of, and do they represent
a continuous population or naturally divide into separate groups? Measuring their masses and thus
bulk densities can help address these questions of their origin and composition. To that end, we
began the Magellan-TESS Survey (MTS), which uses Magellan II/PFS to obtain radial velocity (RV)
masses of 30 transiting exoplanets discovered by TESS and develops an analysis framework that connects
observed planet distributions to underlying populations. In the past, RV measurements of small
planets have been challenging to obtain due to the faintness and low RV semi-amplitudes of most Kepler
systems, and challenging to interpret due to the potential biases in the existing ensemble of small
planet masses from non-algorithmic decisions for target selection and observation plans. The
MTS attempts to minimize these biases by focusing on bright TESS targets and employing a quantitative
selection function and multi-year observing strategy. In this paper, we (1) describe the motivation
and survey strategy behind the MTS, (2) present our first catalog of planet mass and density constraints
for 25 TESS Objects of Interest (TOIs; 20 in our population analysis sample, five that are members
of the same systems), and (3) employ a hierarchical Bayesian model to produce preliminary constraints
on the mass-radius (M-R) relation. We find qualitative agreement with prior mass-radius relations
but some quantitative differences (abridged). The the results of this work can inform more detailed
studies of individual systems and offer a framework that can be applied to future RV surveys with
the goal of population inferences.

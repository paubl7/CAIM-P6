We use comparisons between the SAMI Galaxy Survey and equilibrium galaxy models to infer the importance
of disc fading in the transition of spirals into lenticular (S0) galaxies. The local S0 population
has both higher photometric concentration and lower stellar spin than spiral galaxies of comparable
mass and we test whether this separation can be accounted for by passive aging alone. We construct
a suite of dynamically self--consistent galaxy models, with a bulge, disc and halo using the GalactICS
code. The dispersion-dominated bulge is given a uniformly old stellar population, while the disc
is given a current star formation rate putting it on the main sequence, followed by sudden instantaneous
quenching. We then generate mock observables (r-band images, stellar velocity and dispersion
maps) as a function of time since quenching for a range of bulge/total (B/T) mass ratios. The disc
fading leads to a decline in measured spin as the bulge contribution becomes more dominant, and also
leads to increased concentration. However, the quantitative changes observed after 5 Gyr of disc
fading cannot account for all of the observed difference. We see similar results if we instead subdivide
our SAMI Galaxy Survey sample by star formation (relative to the main sequence). We use EAGLE simulations
to also take into account progenitor bias, using size evolution to infer quenching time. The EAGLE
simulations suggest that the progenitors of current passive galaxies typically have slightly
higher spin than present day star-forming disc galaxies of the same mass. As a result, progenitor
bias moves the data further from the disc fading model scenario, implying that intrinsic dynamical
evolution must be important in the transition from star-forming discs to passive discs.

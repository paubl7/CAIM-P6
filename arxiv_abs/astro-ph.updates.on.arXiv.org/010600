Dusty star-forming galaxies at high redshift (1 < z < 3) represent the most intense star-forming
regions in the Universe. Key aspects to these processes are the gas heating and cooling mechanisms.
Although it is well known that these galaxies are gas-rich, little is known about the gas excitation
conditions. Here we examine these processes in a sample of 24 strongly lensed star-forming galaxies
identified by the \textit{Planck} satellite (LPs) at z ~ 1.1 - 3.5. We analyze 162 CO rotational transitions
(ranging from Jupper = 1 - 12) and 37 atomic carbon fine-structure lines ([CI]) in order to characterize
the physical conditions of the gas in sample of LPs. We simultaneously fit the CO and [CI] lines, and
the dust continuum emission, using two different non-LTE, radiative transfer models. The first
model represents a two component gas density, while the second assumes a turbulence driven log-normal
gas density distribution. These LPs are among the most gas-rich, infrared (IR) luminous galaxies
ever observed ($\mu_{\rm L}$L$_{\rm IR(8-1000\mu m) } \sim 10^{13-14.6} $\Lsun; $< \mu_{\rm L}$M$_{\rm
ISM}> = 2.7 \pm 1.2 \times 10^{12}$ \Msun, with $\mu_{\rm L} \sim 10-30$ the average lens magnification
factor). Our results suggest that the turbulent ISM present in the LPs can be well-characterized
by a high turbulent velocity dispersion ($<\Delta V_{\rm turb}> \sim 100 $ \kms) and gas kinetic
temperature to dust temperature ratios $<T_{\rm kin}$/$T_{\rm d}> \sim 2.5$, sustained on scales
larger than a few kpc. We speculate that the average surface density of the molecular gas mass and
IR luminosity $\Sigma_{\rm M_{\rm ISM}}$ $\sim 10^{3 - 4}$ \Msun pc$^{-2}$ and $\Sigma_{\rm L_{\rm
IR}}$ $\sim 10^{11 - 12}$ \Lsun kpc$^{-2}$, arise from both stellar mechanical feedback and a steady
momentum injection from the accretion of intergalactic gas.

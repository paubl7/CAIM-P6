Using the relativistic MHD code MPI-AMRVAC and a radiative transfer code in post-processing, we
explore the influence of the magnetic-field configuration and transverse stratification of an
over-pressured jet on its morphology, on the moving shock dynamics, and on the emitted radio light
curve. First, we investigate different large-scale magnetic fields with their effects on the standing
shocks and on the stratified jet morphology. Secondly, we study the interaction of a moving shock
wave with the standing shocks. We calculate the synthetic synchrotron maps and radio light curves
and analyse the variability at two frequencies 1 and 15.3 GHz and for several observation angles.
Finally, we compare the characteristics of our simulated light curves with radio flares observed
from the blazar 3C 273 with OVRO and VLBA in the MOJAVE survey between 2008 and 2019. We find that, in
a structured, over-pressured relativistic jet, the presence of the large-scale magnetic field
structure changes the properties of the standing shock waves and leads to an opening of the jet. When
crossing such standing shocks, moving shock waves accompanying overdensities injected in the
base of the jet are causing very luminous radio flares. The observation of the temporal structure
of these flares under different viewing angles probes the jet at different optical depths. At 1 GHz
and for small angles, the self-absorption caused by the moving shock wave becomes more important
and leads to a drop in the observed flux after it interacts with the brightest standing knot. A weak
asymmetry is seen in the shape of the simulated flares, resulting from the remnant emission of the
shocked standing shocks. The characteristics of the simulated flares and the correlation of peaks
in the light curve with the crossing of moving and standing shocks favor this scenario as an explanation
of the observed radio flares of 3C 273.

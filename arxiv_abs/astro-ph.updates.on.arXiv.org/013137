Contrary to expectations from scenarios of black hole growth driven by galaxy interactions and
mergers, dual active galactic nuclei (AGN) with kiloparsec separations are rarely observed and
are very difficult to identify, in particular at high redshifts (i.e. z>2). Focussing on the recently
discovered dual AGN system LBQS 0302-0019 at z=3.29, we seek to identify further group members in
its environment and to understand their formation history through deep high-angular-resolution
imaging. We present deep Hubble Space Telescope (HST) Wide-field Camera 3 near-infrared imaging
of LBQS 0302-0019. In combination with ground-based VLT/HAWK-I imaging, we infer accurate sizes,
colours, ages, and stellar masses of companion galaxies. We clearly detect four companion objects
close to LBQS 0302-0019 that also have faint signatures in the ground-based images. We constrain
light-weighted ages and masses for the two most prominent companions, Jil1 and Jil2, to $t_\star=252_{-109}^{+222}$Myr
with $\log(M_\star/[\mathrm{M}_\odot])= 11.2_{-0.1}^{+0.3}$ and $t_{\star}=19_{-14}^{+74}$Myr
with $\log(M_\star/[\mathrm{M}_\odot])= 9.4_{-0.4}^{+0.9}$, respectively. The HST data also
show that the obscured AGN, previously identified by strong nebular HeII emission, is associated
with the young massive companion Jil2. Because very massive stars of the starburst cannot be solely
responsible for the HeII emission, we strengthen our initial conclusion that Jil2 has been hosting
an AGN. If the young starburst of Jil2 had been accompanied by sustained black hole growth, Jil2 may
have contributed HeII-ionising flux to create the large HeII Ly$\alpha$ proximity zone around
LBQS 0302-0019. Hence, the duration of the current luminous AGN episode of LBQS 0302-0019 may have
been overestimated.

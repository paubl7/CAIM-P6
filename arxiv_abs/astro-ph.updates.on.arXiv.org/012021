Multi-wavelength images from the farUV (~0.15 micron) to the sub-millimeter of the central region
of the galaxy NGC 3351 are analyzed to constrain its stellar populations and dust attenuation. Despite
hosting a ~1 kpc circumnuclear starburst ring, NGC 3351 deviates from the IRX-beta relation, the
relation between the infrared-to-UV luminosity ratio and the UV continuum slope (beta) that other
starburst galaxies follow. To understand the reason for the deviation, we leverage the high angular
resolution of archival nearUV-to-nearIR HST images to divide the ring into ~60-180 pc size regions
and model each individually. We find that the UV slope of the combined intrinsic (dust-free) stellar
populations in the central region is redder than what is expected for a young model population. This
is due to the region's complex star formation history, which boosts the nearUV emission relative
to the farUV. The resulting net attenuation curve has a UV slope that lies between those of the starburst
attenuation curve (Calzetti et al. 2000) and the Small Magellanic Cloud extinction curve; the total-to-selective
attenuation value, R'(V)=4.93, is larger than both. As found for other star-forming galaxies,
the stellar continuum of NGC 3351 is less attenuated than the ionized gas, with E(B-V)_{star}=0.40
E(B-V)_{gas}. The combination of the `red' intrinsic stellar population and the new attenuation
curve fully accounts for the location of the central region of NGC 3351 on the IRX-beta diagram. Thus,
the observed characteristics result from the complex mixture of stellar populations and dust column
densities in the circumnuclear region. Despite being a sample of one, these findings highlight
the difficulty of defining attenuation curves of general applicability outside the regime of centrally-concentrated
starbursts.

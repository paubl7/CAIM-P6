The solar acoustic oscillations are likely stochastically excited by convective dynamics in the
solar photosphere, though few direct observations of individual source events have been made and
their detailed characteristics are still unknown. Wave source identification requires measurements
that can reliably discriminate the local wave signal from the background convective motions and
resonant modal power. This is quite challenging as these 'noise' contributions have amplitudes
several orders of magnitude greater than the sources and the propagating wave fields they induce.
In this paper, we employ a high-temporal-frequency filter to identify sites of acoustic emission
in a radiative magnetohydrodynamic simulation. The properties of the filter were determined from
a convolutional neural network trained to identify the two-dimensional acoustic Green's function
response of the atmosphere, but once defined, it can be directly applied to an image time series to
extract the signal of local wave excitation, bypassing the need for the original neural network.
Using the filter developed, we have uncovered previously unknown properties of the acoustic emission
process. In the simulation, acoustic events are found to be clustered at mesogranular scales, with
peak emission quite deep, about 500 km below the photosphere, and sites of very strong emission can
result from the interaction of two supersonic downflows that merge at that depth. We suggest that
the method developed, when applied to high-resolution high-cadence observations, such as those
forthcoming with Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope (DKIST), will have important applications in
chromospheric wave-studies and may lead to new investigations in high-resolution local-helioseismology.

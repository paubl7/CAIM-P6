Variability observed in photometric lightcurves of late-type stars (on timescales longer than
a day) is a dominant noise source in exoplanet surveys and results predominantly from surface manifestations
of stellar magnetic activity, namely faculae and spots. The implementation of faculae in lightcurve
models is an open problem, with scaling typically based on spectra equivalent to hot stellar atmospheres
or assuming a solar-derived facular contrast. We modelled rotational (single period) lightcurves
of active G2, K0, M0 and M2 stars, with Sun-like surface distributions and realistic limb-dependent
contrasts for faculae and spots. The sensitivity of lightcurve variability to changes in model
parameters such as stellar inclination, feature area coverage, spot temperature, facular region
magnetic flux density and active band latitudes is explored. For our lightcurve modelling approach
we used actress, a geometrically accurate model for stellar variability. actress generates 2-sphere
maps representing stellar surfaces and populates them with user-prescribed spot and facular region
distributions. From this, lightcurves can be calculated at any inclination. Quiet star limb darkening
and limb-dependent facular contrasts were derived from MURaM 3D magnetoconvection simulations
using ATLAS9. 1D stellar atmosphere models were used for the spot contrasts. We applied actress
in Monte-Carlo simulations, calculating lightcurve variability amplitudes in the Kepler band.
We found that, for a given spectral type and stellar inclination, spot temperature and spot area
coverage have the largest effect on variability of all simulation parameters. For a spot coverage
of 1%, the typical variability of a solar-type star is around 2 parts-per-thousand. The presence
of faculae clearly affects the mean brightness and lightcurve shape, but has relatively little
influence on the variability.

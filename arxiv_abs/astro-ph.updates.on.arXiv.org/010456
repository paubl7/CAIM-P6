The proposal that core collapse supernovae are neutrino driven is still the subject of active investigation
more than fifty years after the seminal paper by Colgate and White. The modern version of this paradigm,
which we owe to Wilson, proposes that the supernova shock wave is powered by neutrino heating, mediated
by the absorption of electron-flavor neutrinos and antineutrinos emanating from the proto-neutron
star surface, or neutrinosphere. Neutrino weak interactions with the stellar core fluid, the theory
of which is still evolving, are flavor and energy dependent. The associated neutrino mean free paths
extend over many orders of magnitude and are never always small relative to the stellar core radius.
Thus, neutrinos are never always fluid like. Instead, a kinetic description of them in terms of distribution
functions that determine the number density of neutrinos in the six-dimensional phase space of
position, direction, and energy, for both neutrinos and antineutrinos of each flavor, or in terms
of angular moments of these neutrino distributions that instead provide neutrino number densities
in the four-dimensional phase-space subspace of position and energy, is needed. In turn, the computational
challenge is twofold: (i) to map the kinetic equations governing the evolution of these distributions
or moments onto discrete representations that are stable, accurate, and, perhaps most important,
respect physical laws such as conservation of lepton number and energy and the Fermi--Dirac nature
of neutrinos and (ii) to develop efficient, supercomputer-architecture-aware solution methods
for the resultant nonlinear algebraic equations. In this review, we present the current state of
the art in attempts to meet this challenge.

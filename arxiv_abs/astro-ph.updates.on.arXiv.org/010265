We perform the first three-dimensional radiation hydrodynamical simulations that investigate
the growth of intermediate-mass BHs (IMBHs) embedded in massive self-gravitating, dusty nuclear
accretion disks. We explore the dependence of mass accretion efficiency on the gas metallicity
$Z$ and mass injection at super-Eddington accretion rates from the outer galactic disk $\dot{M}_{\rm
in}$, and find that the central BH can be fed at rates exceeding the Eddington rate only when the dusty
disk becomes sufficiently optically thick to ionizing radiation. In this case, mass outflows from
the disk owing to photoevaporation is suppressed and thus a large fraction ($\gtrsim 40\%$) of the
mass injection rate can feed the central BH. The conditions are expressed as $\dot{M}_{\rm in} >
2.2\times 10^{-1}~M_\odot ~{\rm yr}^{-1} (1+Z/10^{-2}~Z_\odot)^{-1}(c_{\rm s}/10~{\rm km~s}^{-1})$,
where $c_{\rm s}$ is the sound speed in the gaseous disk. With increasing numerical resolution,
vigorous disk fragmentation reduces the disk surface density and dynamical heating by formed clumps
makes the disk thickness higher. As a result, the photoevaorative mass-loss rate rises and thus
the critical injection rate increases for fixed metallicity. This process enables super-Eddington
growth of BHs until the BH mass reaches $M_{\rm BH} \sim 10^{7-8}~M_\odot$, depending on the properties
of the host dark-matter halo and metal-enrichment history. In the assembly of protogalaxies, seed
BHs that form in overdense regions with a mass variance of 3-4$\sigma$ at $z\sim 15-20$ are able to
undergo short periods of their rapid growth and transits into the Eddington-limited growth phase
afterwards to be supermassive BHs observed at $z>6-7$.

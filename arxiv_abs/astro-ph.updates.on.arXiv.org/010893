The H{\alpha} spectral line is a well-studied absorption line revealing properties of the highly
structured and dynamic solar chromosphere. Typical features with distinct spectral signatures
in H{\alpha} include filaments and prominences, bright active-region plages, superpenumbrae
around sunspots, surges, flares, Ellerman bombs, filigree, and mottles and rosettes, among others.
This study is based on high-spectral resolution H{\alpha} spectra obtained with the echelle spectrograph
of the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT) located at Observatorio del Teide (ODT), Tenerife, Spain. The
t-distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a machine learning algorithm, which is
used for nonlinear dimensionality reduction. In this application, it projects H{\alpha} spectra
onto a two-dimensional map, where it becomes possible to classify the spectra according to results
of Cloud Model (CM) inversions. The CM parameters optical depth, Doppler width, line-of-sight
velocity, and source function describe properties of the cloud material. Initial results of t-SNE
indicate its strong discriminatory power to separate quiet-Sun and plage profiles from those that
are suitable for CM inversions. In addition, a detailed study of various t-SNE parameters is conducted,
the impact of seeing conditions on the classification is assessed, results for various types of
input data are compared, and the identified clusters are linked to chromospheric features. Although
t-SNE proves to be efficient in clustering high-dimensional data, human inference is required
at each step to interpret the results. This exploratory study provides a framework and ideas on how
to tailor a classification scheme towards specific spectral data and science questions.

Quantifying tidal interactions in close-in two-body systems is of prime interest since they have
a crucial impact on the architecture and on the rotational history of the bodies. Various studies
have shown that the dissipation of tides in either body is very sensitive to its structure and to its
dynamics, like differential rotation which exists in the outer convective enveloppe of solar-like
stars and giant gaseous planets. In particular, tidal waves may strongly interact with zonal flows
at the so-called corotation resonances, where the wave's Doppler-shifted frequency cancels out.
We aim to provide a deep physical understanding of the dynamics of tidal inertial waves at corotation
resonances, in the presence of differential rotation profiles typical of low-mass stars and giant
planets. By developping an inclined shearing box, we investigate the propagation and the transmission
of free inertial waves at corotation, and more generally at critical levels, which are singularities
in the governing wave differential equation. Through the construction of an invariant called the
wave action flux, we identify different regimes of wave transmission at critical levels, which
are confirmed with a one-dimensional three-layer numerical model. We find that inertial waves
can be either fully transmitted, strongly damped, or even amplified after crossing a critical level.
The occurrence of these regimes depends on the assumed profile of differential rotation, on the
nature as well as the latitude of the critical level, and on wave parameters such as the inertial frequency
and the longitudinal and vertical wavenumbers. Waves can thus either deposit their action flux
to the fluid when damped at critical levels, or they can extract action flux to the fluid when amplified
at critical levels. Both situations could lead to significant angular momentum exchange between
the tidally interacting bodies.

The large separation in the low radial order regime is considered as a highly valuable observable
to derive mean densities of $\delta$ Scuti stars, due to its independence with rotation. Up to now,
theoretical studies of this $\Delta\nu$-${\bar \rho}$ relation have been limited to 1D non-rotating
models, and 2D pseudo-evolutionary models. The present work aims at completing this scenario by
investigating quantitatively the impact of rotation in this relation on a large grid of 1D asteroseismic
models representative of $\delta$ Scuti stars. These include rotation effects on both the stellar
evolution and the interaction with pulsation. This allowed us to compute the stellar deformation,
get the polar and equatorial radii, and correct the stellar mean densities. We found that the new
$\Delta\nu$-${\bar \rho}$ relation for rotating models is compatible with previous works. We
explained the dispersion of the points around the linear fits as caused mainly by the distribution
of the stellar mass, and partially by the evolutionary stage. The new fit is found to be close to the
previous theoretical studies for lower masses ($1.3-1.81\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$). However,
the opposite holds for the observations: for the higher masses ($1.81-3\,\mathrm{M}_{\odot}$)
the fit is more compatible with the empirical relation. We applied these results to characterise
the two well-known $\delta$ Scuti stars observed by CoRoT, HD174936 and HD174966, and compared
the physical parameters with those of previous works. Inclusion of rotation in the modelling causes
a tendency towards greater masses, radii, luminosities and lower density values. Comparison between
$\Delta\nu$ and Gaia's luminosities also allowed us to constraint the inclination angles and rotational
velocities of both stars. The present results pave the way to systematically constrain the angle
of inclination of $\delta$ Scuti stars

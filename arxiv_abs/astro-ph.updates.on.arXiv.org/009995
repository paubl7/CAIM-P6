We present a unified model for X-ray quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs) seen in Narrow-line Seyfert
1 (NLSy1) galaxies, $\gamma$-ray and optical band QPOs that are seen in Blazars. The origin of these
QPOs is attributed to the plasma motion in corona or jets of these AGN. In the case of X-ray QPOs, we
apply the general relativistic precession model for the two simultaneous QPOs seen in NLSy1 1H 0707-945
and deduce orbital parameters like the radius of the emission region, and spin parameter $a$ for
a circular orbit, while we obtain the Carter's constant $Q$, $a$, and the radius in the case of a spherical
orbit solution. In other cases where only one X-ray QPO is seen we localize the orbital parameters
for NLSy1 galaxies REJ 1034+396, 2XMM J123103.2+110648, MS 2254.9-3712, Mrk 766, and MCG-06-30-15.
By applying the lighthouse model, we find that a kinematic origin of the jet based $\gamma$-ray and
optical QPOs, in a relativistic MHD framework, is possible. Based on the inbuilt Hamiltonian formulation
with a power-law distribution in the orbital energy of the plasma consisting of only circular or
spherical trajectories, we show that the resulting Fourier power spectral density (PSD) has a break
corresponding to the energy at ISCO. Further, we derive connection formulae between the slopes
in the PSD and that of the energy distribution. Overall, given the preliminary but promising results
of these relativistic orbit models to match the observed QPO frequencies and PSD at diverse scales
in the inner corona and the jet, it motivates us to build detailed models including a transfer function
for the energy spectrum in the corona and relativistic MHD jet models for plasma flow and its polarization
properties.

The ensemble of chemical element abundance measurements for stars, along with precision distances
and orbit properties, provides high-dimensional data to study the evolution of the Milky Way. With
this third data release of the Galactic Archaeology with HERMES (GALAH) survey, we publish 678 423
spectra for 588 571 mostly nearby stars (81.2% of stars are within <2 kpc), observed with the HERMES
spectrograph at the Anglo-Australian Telescope. This release (hereafter GALAH+ DR3) includes
all observations from GALAH Phase 1 (bright, main, and faint survey, 70%), K2-HERMES (17%), TESS-HERMES
(5%), and a subset of ancillary observations (8%) including the bulge and >75 stellar clusters.
We derive stellar parameters $T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, [Fe/H], $v_\text{mic}$, $v_\text{broad}$
& $v_\text{rad}$ using our modified version of the spectrum synthesis code Spectroscopy Made Easy
(SME) and 1D MARCS model atmospheres. We break spectroscopic degeneracies in our spectrum analysis
with astrometry from $Gaia$ DR2 and photometry from 2MASS. We report abundance ratios [X/Fe] for
30 different elements (11 of which are based on non-LTE computations) covering five nucleosynthetic
pathways. We describe validations for accuracy and precision, flagging of peculiar stars/measurements
and recommendations for using our results. Our catalogue comprises 65% dwarfs, 34% giants, and
1% other/unclassified stars. Based on unflagged chemical composition and age, we find 62% young
low-$\alpha$, 9% young high-$\alpha$, 27% old high-$\alpha$, and 2% stars with $\mathrm{[Fe/H]}
\leq -1$. Based on kinematics, 4% are halo stars. Several Value-Added-Catalogues, including stellar
ages and dynamics, updated after $Gaia$ eDR3, accompany this release and allow chrono-chemodynamic
analyses, as we showcase.

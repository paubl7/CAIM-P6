Hybrid hadron-quark equations of state that give rise a third family of stable compact stars have
been shown to be compatible with the LIGO-Virgo event GW170817. Stable configurations in the third
family are called hybrid hadron-quark stars. The equilibrium stable hybrid hadron-quark star
branch is separated by the stable neutron star branch with a branch of unstable hybrid hadron-quark
stars. The end-state of these unstable configurations has not been studied, yet, and it could have
implications for the formation and existence of twin stars -- hybrid stars with the same mass as neutron
stars but different radii. We modify existing hybrid hadron-quark equations of state with a first-order
phase transition in order to guarantee a well-posed initial value problem of the equations of general
relativistic hydrodynamics, and study the dynamics of non-rotating or rotating unstable twin
stars via 3-dimensional simulations in full general relativity. We find that unstable twin stars
naturally migrate toward the hadronic branch. Before settling into the hadronic regime, these
stars undergo (quasi)radial oscillations on a dynamical timescale while the core bounces between
the two phases. Our study suggests that it may be difficult to form stable twin stars if the phase transition
is sustained over a large jump in energy density, and hence it may be more likely that astrophysical
hybrid hadron-quark stars have masses above the twin star regime. We also study the minimum-mass
instability for hybrid stars, and find that these configurations do not explode, unlike the minimum-mass
instability for neutron stars. Additionally, our results suggest that oscillations between the
two Quantum Chromodynamic phases could provide gravitational wave signals associated with such
phase transitions in core-collapse supernovae and white dwarf-neutron star mergers.

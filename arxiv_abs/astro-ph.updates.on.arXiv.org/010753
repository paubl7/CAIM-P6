Several important mechanisms that explain the coherent pulsar radio emission rely on streaming
(or beam) instabilities of the relativistic pair plasma in a pulsar magnetosphere. However, it
is still not clear whether a streaming instability by itself is sufficient to explain the observed
coherent radio emission. Due to the relativistic conditions that are present in the pulsar magnetosphere,
kinetic instabilities could be quenched. Moreover, uncertainties regarding specific model-dependent
parameters impede conclusions concerning this question. Our aim is to constrain the possible parameter
range for which a streaming instability could lead to pulsar radio emission. We focus on the transition
between strong and weak beam models, beam drift speed, and temperature dependence of the beam and
background plasma components. We use a linear relativistic kinetic dispersion relation appropriate
for pulsar conditions solved in a more general way than in previous studies, considering a wider
parameter range. We validate the analytical results by comparison with relativistic kinetic particle-in-cell
(PIC) numerical simulations. The growth rates obtained in dependence on background and beam densities,
temperatures and streaming velocities showed a remarkable agreement of the linear dispersion
predictions and numerical simulation results in a wide parameter range. Monotonous growth was
found when increasing the beam-to-background density ratio. With growing beam velocity, the growth
rates firstly increase, reach a maximum and decrease again for higher beam velocities. Monotonous
dependence on the plasma temperatures was found, featuring an asymptotic behaviour when reaching
colder temperatures. It was shown that the generated waves are phase coherent by calculating the
fractional bandwidth. We provide a explicit parameter range of plasma conditions for efficient
pulsar radio emission.

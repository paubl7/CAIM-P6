Sulfur is the tenth most abundant element in the universe and is known to play a significant role in
biological systems. Accordingly, in recent years there has been increased interest in the role
of sulfur in astrochemical reactions and planetary geology and geochemistry. Among the many avenues
of research currently being explored is the laboratory processing of astrophysical ice analogues.
Such research involves the synthesis of an ice of specific morphology and chemical composition
at temperatures and pressures relevant to a selected astrophysical setting (such as the interstellar
medium or the surfaces of icy moons). Subsequent processing of the ice under conditions that simulate
the selected astrophysical setting commonly involves radiolysis, photolysis, thermal processing,
neutral-neutral fragment chemistry, or any combination of these, and has been the subject of several
studies. The in-situ changes in ice morphology and chemistry occurring during such processing
has been monitored via spectroscopic or spectrometric techniques. In this paper, we have reviewed
the results of laboratory investigations concerned with sulfur chemistry in several astrophysical
ice analogues. Specifically, we review (i) the spectroscopy of sulfur-containing astrochemical
molecules in the condensed phase, (ii) atom and radical addition reactions, (iii) the thermal processing
of sulfur-bearing ices, (iv) photochemical experiments, (v) the non-reactive charged particle
radiolysis of sulfur-bearing ices, and (vi) sulfur ion bombardment of and implantation in ice analogues.
Potential future studies in the field of solid phase sulfur astrochemistry are also discussed in
the context of forthcoming space missions, such as the NASA James Webb Space Telescope and the ESA
Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer mission.

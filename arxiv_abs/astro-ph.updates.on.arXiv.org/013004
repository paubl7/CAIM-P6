The complex structure of gas, metals, and dust in the interstellar and circumgalactic medium (ISM
and CGM, respectively) in star-forming galaxies can be probed by Ly$\alpha$ emission and absorption,
low-ionization interstellar (LIS) metal absorption, and dust reddening E(B-V). We present a statistical
analysis of the mutual correlations among Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW$_{Ly\alpha}$), LIS
equivalent width (EW$_{LIS}$), and E(B-V) in a sample of 157 star-forming galaxies at $z\sim2.3$.
With measurements obtained from individual, deep rest-UV spectra and spectral-energy distribution
(SED) modeling, we find that the tightest correlation exists between EW$_{LIS}$ and E(B-V), although
correlations among all three parameters are statistically significant. These results signal
a direct connection between dust and metal-enriched HI gas, and that they are likely co-spatial.
By comparing our results with the predictions of different ISM/CGM models, we favor a dusty ISM/CGM
model where dust resides in HI gas clumps and Ly$\alpha$ photons escape through the low HI covering
fraction/column density intra-clump medium. Finally, we investigate the factors that potentially
contribute to the intrinsic scatter in the correlations studied in this work, including metallicity,
outflow kinematics, Ly$\alpha$ production efficiency, and slit loss. Specifically, we find evidence
that scatter in the relationship between EW$_{Ly\alpha}$ and E(B-V) reflects the variation in
metal-to-HI covering fraction ratio as a function of metallicity, and the effects of outflows on
the porosity of the ISM/CGM. Future simulations incorporating star-formation feedback and the
radiative transfer of Ly$\alpha$ photons will provide key constraints on the spatial distributions
of neutral hydrogen gas and dust in the ISM/CGM structure.

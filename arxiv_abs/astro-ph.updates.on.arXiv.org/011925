Using Chandra observations, we derive the $Y_{\rm X}$ proxy and associated total mass measurement,
$M_{500}^{\rm Y_X}$, for 147 clusters with $z \leq 0.35$ from the Planck Early Sunyaev-Zel'dovich
catalog, and for 80 clusters with $z \leq 0.30$ from an X-ray flux-limited sample. We re-extract
the Planck $Y_{\rm SZ}$ measurements and obtain the corresponding mass proxy, $M_{500}^{\rm SZ}$,
from the full Planck mission maps, minimizing the Malmquist bias due to observational scatter.
The masses re-extracted using the more precise X-ray position and characteristic size agree with
the published PSZ2 values, but yield a significant reduction in the scatter (by a factor of two) in
the $M_{500}^{\rm SZ}$-$M_{500}^{\rm X}$ relation. The slope is $0.93\pm0.03$, and the median
ratio, $M_{500}^{\rm SZ}/M_{500}^{\rm X}= 0.91\pm0.01$, is within the expectations from known
X-ray calibration systematics. The $Y_{\rm SZ}/Y_{\rm X}$ ratio is $0.88\pm0.02$, in good agreement
with predictions from cluster structure, and implying a low level of clumpiness. In agreement with
the findings of the Planck Collaboration, the slope of the $Y_{\rm SZ}$-$D_{\rm A}^{-2} Y_{X}$
flux relation is significantly less than unity ($0.89\pm0.01$). Using extensive simulations,
we show that this result is not due to selection effects, intrinsic scatter, or covariance between
quantities. We demonstrate analytically that changing the $Y_{\rm SZ}$-$Y_{X}$ relation from
apparent flux to intrinsic properties results in a best-fit slope that is closer to unity and increases
the dispersion about the relation. The redistribution resulting from this transformation implies
that the best fit parameters of the $M_{500}^{\rm SZ}$-$M_{500}^{\rm X}$ relation will be sample-dependent.

Recent detailed 1D core-collapse simulations have brought new insights on the final fate of massive
stars, which are in contrast to commonly used parametric prescriptions. In this work, we explore
the implications of these results to the formation of coalescing black-hole (BH) - neutron-star
(NS) binaries, such as the candidate event GW190426_152155 reported in GWTC-2. Furthermore, we
investigate the effects of natal kicks and the NS's radius on the synthesis of such systems and potential
electromagnetic counterparts linked to them. Synthetic models based on detailed core-collapse
simulations result in an increased merger detection rate of BH-NS systems ($\sim 2.3$ yr$^{-1}$),
5 to 10 times larger than the predictions of "standard" parametric prescriptions. This is primarily
due to the formation of low-mass BH via direct collapse, and hence no natal kicks, favored by the detailed
simulations. The fraction of observed systems that will produce an electromagnetic counterpart,
with the detailed supernova engine, ranges from $2$-$25$%, depending on uncertainties in the NS
equation of state. Notably, in most merging systems with electromagnetic counterparts, the NS
is the first-born compact object, as long as the NS's radius is $\lesssim 12\,\mathrm{km}$. Furthermore,
core-collapse models that predict the formation of low-mass BHs with negligible natal kicks increase
the detection rate of GW190426_152155-like events to $\sim 0.6 \, $yr$^{-1}$; with an associated
probability of electromagnetic counterpart $\leq 10$% for all supernova engines. However, increasing
the production of direct-collapse low-mass BHs also increases the synthesis of binary BHs, over-predicting
their measured local merger density rate. In all cases, models based on detailed core-collapse
simulation predict a ratio of BH-NSs to binary BHs merger rate density that is at least twice as high
as other prescriptions.

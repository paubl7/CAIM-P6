We employ the hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG-300-1 to explore the halo occupation distribution
(HOD) and environmental dependence of luminous star-forming emission-line galaxies (ELGs) at
$z \sim 1$. Such galaxies are key targets for current and upcoming cosmological surveys. We select
model galaxies through cuts in colour-colour space allowing for a direct comparison with the Extended
Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey and the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI)
surveys and then compare them with galaxies selected based on specific star-formation rate (sSFR)
and stellar mass. We demonstrate that the ELG populations are twice more likely to reside in lower-density
regions (sheets) compared with the mass-selected populations and twice less likely to occupy the
densest regions of the cosmic web (knots). We also show that the colour-selected and sSFR-selected
ELGs exhibit very similar occupation and clustering statistics, finding that the agreement is
best for lower redshifts. In contrast with the mass-selected sample, the occupation of haloes by
a central ELG peaks at $\sim$20\%. We furthermore explore the dependence of the HOD and the auto-correlation
on environment, noticing that at fixed halo mass, galaxies in high-density regions cluster about
10 times more strongly than low-density ones. This result suggests that we should model carefully
the galaxy-halo relation and implement assembly bias effects into our models (estimated at $\sim$4\%
of the clustering of the DESI colour-selected sample at $z = 0.8$). Finally, we apply a simple mock
recipe to recover the clustering on large scales ($r \gtrsim 1 \ {\rm Mpc}/h$) to within 1\% by augmenting
the HOD model with an environment dependence, demonstrating the power of adopting flexible population
models.

The Galactic Center region, including the nuclear disk, has until recently been largely avoided
in chemical census studies because of extreme extinction and stellar crowding. Making use of the
latest APOGEE data release (DR16), we are able for the first time to study cool AGB stars and supergiants
in this region. The stellar parameters of five known AGB stars and one supergiant star (VR 5-7) show
that their location is well above the tip of the RGB.We study metallicities of 157 M giants situated
within 150 pc of the Galactic center from observations obtained by the APOGEE survey with reliable
stellar parameters from the APOGEE/ASPCAP pipeline making use of the cool star grid down to 3200
K. Distances, interstellar extinction values, and radial velocities were checked to confirm that
these stars are indeed situated in the Galactic Center region. We detect a clear bimodal structure
in the metallicity distribution function, with a dominant metal-rich peak of [Fe/H] ~ +0.3 dex and
a metal-poor peak around [Fe/H]= -0.5 dex, which is 0.2 dex poorer than Baade's Window. The alpha-elements
Mg, Si, Ca, and O show a similar trend to the Galactic Bulge. The metal-poor component is enhanced
in the alpha-elements, suggesting that this population could be associated with the classical
bulge and a fast formation scenario. We find a clear signature of a rotating nuclear stellar disk
and a significant fraction of high velocity stars with $\rm v_{gal} > 300\,km/s$; the metal-rich
stars show a much higher rotation velocity ($\rm \sim 200\,km/s$) with respect to the metal-poor
stars ($\rm \sim 140\,km/s$). The chemical abundances as well as the metallicity distribution
function suggest that the nuclear stellar disc and the nuclear star cluster show distinct chemical
signatures and might be formed differently.

We performed timing and spectral analysis of multi-epoch Suzaku, XMM-Newton and NuSTAR observations
of the ultraluminous X-ray source (ULX) Circinus ULX5, to put constraints on the mass of the central
object and the accretion mode operating in this source. We aim to answer whether the source contains
a stellar mass black hole with a super-Eddington accretion flow or an intermediate mass black hole
accreting matter in a sub-Eddington mode. Moreover, we search for major observed changes in spectra
and timing occur, and determine if they are associated with major structural changes in the disk,
similar to those in black hole X-ray binaries. We performed timing and spectral analysis to study
the relation between luminosity and inner disk temperature. We constructed the hardness ratio
versus intensity diagram to reveal spectral state transitions in Circinus ULX5. Our spectral analysis
revealed at least three distinctive spectral states of Circinus ULX5, in analogy to state transitions
in Galactic black hole X-ray binaries. Disk-dominated spectra are found in high flux states and
the power-law dominated spectra are found in lower flux states. The source was also observed in an
intermediate state, where the flux was low, but spectrum is dominated by a disk component. Over eighteen
years of collected data, ULX5 appeared two times in the high, three times in the low, and two times
in the intermediate state. The fastest observed transition was $\sim$7 months. Our analysis suggests
that the central object in Circinus ULX5 is a stellar mass BH ($<10\ \rm M_{\odot}$), or possibly
a NS even though we do not detect pulsations in the lightcurves. Fractional variability amplitudes
are consistent with state transitions in Circinus ULX5 wherein higher variability from the power
law-like Comptonized emission gets suppressed in the thermal disk-dominated state.

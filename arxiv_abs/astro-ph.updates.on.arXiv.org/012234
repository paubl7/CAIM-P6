Recent water line observations toward several low-mass protostars suggest low water gas fractional
abundances in the inner warm envelopes. Water destruction by X-rays has been proposed to influence
the water abundances in these regions, but the detailed chemistry, including the nature of alternative
oxygen carriers, is not yet understood. In this study, we aim to understand the impact of X-rays on
the composition of low-mass protostellar envelopes, focusing specifically on water and related
oxygen bearing species. We compute the chemical composition of two low-mass protostellar envelopes
using a 1D gas-grain chemical reaction network, under various X-ray field strengths. According
to our calculations, outside the water snowline, the water gas abundance increases with $L_{\mathrm{X}}$.
Inside the water snowline, water maintains a high abundance of $\sim 10^{-4}$ for small $L_{\mathrm{X}}$,
with water and CO being the dominant oxygen carriers. For large $L_{\mathrm{X}}$, the water gas
abundances significantly decrease just inside the water snowline (down to $\sim10^{-8}-10^{-7}$)
and in the innermost regions ($\sim10^{-6}$). For these cases, the O$_{2}$ and O gas abundances
reach $\sim 10^{-4}$ within the water snowline, and they become the dominant oxygen carriers. The
HCO$^{+}$ and CH$_{3}$OH abundances, which have been used as tracers of the water snowline, significantly
increase/decrease within the water snowline, respectively, as the X-ray fluxes become larger.
The abundances of some other dominant molecules, such as CO$_{2}$, OH, CH$_{4}$, HCN, and NH$_{3}$,
are also affected by strong X-ray fields, especially within their own snowlines. These X-ray effects
are larger in lower density envelope models. Future observations of water and related molecules
(using e.g., ALMA and ngVLA) will access the regions around protostars where such X-ray induced
chemistry is effective.

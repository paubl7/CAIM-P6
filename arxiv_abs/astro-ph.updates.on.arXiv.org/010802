Following the break up of a parent body, the Yarkovsky effect causes asteroid family members to spread
in orbital semimajor axis with a rate often inversely proportional to their diameter. This size
dependent semimajor axis drift causes family members to form structures in the semimajor axis vs
inverse diameter plane that have the shape of the letter V. The V-shape method consists in finding
the borders of such V-shapes of unknown center and opening. Although successfully employed to find
some very old families in the inner main asteroid belt, the V-shape searching method is very sensitive
to many parameters. In this work, we first created and evolved a synthetic asteroid family over billions
of years. Then, by adding uncertainties to semimajor axis and diameter of the evolved synthetic
family components, we randomly generated additional 99 similar, but not perfectly V-shaped, family
clones. We chose a fairly low initial velocity dispersion of 20 m/s for our family. Thus, we can more
easily relate the spreading in semimajor axis with the family's age (slope of the evolving V). A synthetic
background with an initially randomly distributed components was also created and evolved for
100 Myr. Thus, by setting different levels of ratio of the synthetic family and background asteroids,
we derived a detection efficiency map for the V-shape method and determined how sensitive the results
can be based on signal-to-noise levels. We also determined optimal parameter values for the method's
efficiency. We found that, families older than ~3 Gyr are likely undetectable, with a method efficiency
of 50% or less, whereas younger families (0.5--2.5 Gyr) are more easily detected by the method, with
an efficiency of >80%.

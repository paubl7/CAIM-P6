We study the process of the Primordial Black Holes (PBHs) production in the novel framework, namely
$\alpha$-attractor Galileon inflation (G-inflation) model. In our framework, we take the Galileon
function as $G(\phi)=G_{I}(\phi)\left(1+G_{II}(\phi)\right)$, where the part $G_{I}(\phi)$
is motivated from the $\alpha$-attractor inflationary scenario in its original non-canonical
frame, and it ensures for the model to be consistent with the Planck 2018 observations at the CMB scales.
The part $G_{II}(\phi)$ is invoked to enhance the curvature perturbations at some smaller scales
which in turn gives rise to PBHs formation. By fine-tuning of the model parameters, we find three
parameter sets which successfully produce a sufficiently large peak in the curvature power spectrum.
We show that these parameter sets produce PBHs with masses ${\cal O}(10)M_\odot$, ${\cal O}(10^{-5})M_\odot$,
and ${\cal O}(10^{-12})M_\odot$ which can explain the LIGO events, the ultrashort-timescale
microlensing events in OGLE data, and around $0.98\%$ of the current Dark Matter (DM) content of
the universe, respectively. Additionally, we study the secondary Gravitational Waves (GWs) in
our setup and show that our model anticipates the peak of their present fractional energy density
as $\Omega_{GW0} \sim 10^{-8}$ for all the three parameter sets, but at different frequencies.
These predictions can be located well inside the sensitivity region of some GWs detectors, and therefore
the compatibility of our model can be assessed in light of the future data. We further estimate the
tilts of the included GWs spectrum in the different ranges of frequency, and confirm that spectrum
follows the power-law relation $\Omega_{GW0}\sim f^{n}$ in those frequency bands.

Gravitational wave science is a pioneering field with rapidly evolving data analysis methodology
currently assimilating and inventing deep learning techniques. The bulk of the sophisticated
flagship searches of the field rely on the time-tested matched filtering principle within their
core. In this paper, we make a key observation on the relationship between the emerging deep learning
and the traditional techniques: matched filtering is formally equivalent to a particular neural
network. This means that a neural network can be constructed analytically to exactly implement
matched filtering, and can be further trained on data or boosted with additional complexity for
improved performance. This fundamental equivalence allows us to define a "complexity standard
candle" allowing us to characterize the relative complexity of the different approaches to gravitational
wave signals in a common framework. Additionally it also provides a glimpse of an intriguing symmetry
that could provide clues on how neural networks approach the problem of finding signals in overwhelming
noise. Moreover, we show that the proposed neural network architecture can outperform matched
filtering, both with or without knowledge of a prior on the parameter distribution. When a prior
is given, the proposed neural network can approach the statistically optimal performance. We also
propose and investigate two different neural network architectures MNet-Shallow and MNet-Deep,
both of which implement matched filtering at initialization and can be trained on data. MNet-Shallow
has simpler structure, while MNet-Deep is more flexible and can deal with a wider range of distributions.
Our theoretical findings are corroborated by experiments using real LIGO data and synthetic injections.
Finally, our results suggest new perspectives on the role of deep learning in gravitational wave
detection.

We present a study on the relationship between the ratio of the depth of a crater to its diameter and
the diameter for lunar craters both on the maria and on the highlands. We consider craters younger
than 1.1 billion years in age, i.e. of Copernican period. The aim of this work is to improve our understanding
of such relationships based on our new estimates of the craters's depth and diameter. Previous studies
considered similar relationships for much older craters (up to 3.2 billion years). We calculated
the depths of craters with diameters from 10 to 100 km based on the altitude profiles derived from
data obtained by the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) onboard the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter
(LRO). The ratio h/D of the depth h of a crater to its diameter D can diverge by up to a factor of two for
craters with almost the same diameters. The linear and power approximations (regressions) of the
dependence of h/D on D were made for simple and complex Copernican craters selected from the data
from Mazrouei et al. (2019) and Losiak et al. (2015). For the separation of highland craters into
two groups based only on their dependences of h/D on D, at D<18 km these are mostly simple craters,
although some complex craters can have diameters D>16 km. Depths of mare craters with D<14 km are
greater than 0.15D. Following Pike's (1981) classification, we group mare craters of D<15 km as
simple craters. Mare craters with 15<D<18 km fit both approximation curves for simple and complex
craters. Depths of mare craters with D>18 km are in a better agreement with the approximation curve
of h/D vs. D for complex craters than for simple craters. At the same diameter, mare craters are deeper
than highland craters at a diameter smaller than 30-40 km. For greater diameters, highland craters
are deeper.

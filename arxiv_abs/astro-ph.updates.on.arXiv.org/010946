In slowly evolving spherical potentials, $\Phi(r,t)$, radial actions are typically assumed to
remain constant. Here, we construct dynamical invariants that allow us to derive the generic evolution
of radial actions in spherical central potentials with an arbitrary time dependence. We show that
the radial actions oscillate around a constant value with an amplitude $\Delta J_r \propto \dot{\Phi}/\Phi\,P(E,L)$,
where $P$ is the radial period of an orbit with energy $E$ and angular momentum $L$. Using this result,
we develop a diffusion theory that describes the evolution of the radial action distribution of
ensembles of tracer particles orbiting in time-dependent spherical potentials. Tests against
restricted $N$-body simulations in a varying Keplerian potential indicate that our linear theory
is accurate in regions of phase-space in which the diffusion coefficient $\tilde{D}(J_r) < 0.01\,J_r^2$.
For illustration, we show that i) in Milky Way (MW) dark matter haloes with a median mass accretion
history only $\sim 40$ per cent of halo particles evolve within the linear regime since the redshift
of maximum accretion, which calls against using radial actions as `adiabatic invariants' when
attempting to theoretically predict the density profiles of DM haloes, or construct models for
tidal streams in action-angle space. ii) In contrast, the cusp-core transformation of dwarf haloes
in self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) models (with $\sigma/m_\chi = 1\,{\rm cm^2g^{-1}}$) leads
to haloes in which more than $\sim 97$ per cent of DM particles exhibit a linear behaviour of radial
actions. We conclude that the radial action distribution of stellar tracers in SIDM haloes is hardly
affected by self-collisions in the dark sector.

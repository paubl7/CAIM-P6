Here we discuss the current state of knowledge on how atmospheric escape processes can fractionate
noble gas isotopes and moderately volatile rock-forming elements that populate primordial atmospheres,
magma ocean related environments, and catastrophically outgassed steam atmospheres. Variations
of isotopes and volatile elements in different planetary reservoirs keep information about atmospheric
escape, composition and even the source of accreting material. We summarize our knowledge on atmospheric
isotope ratios and discuss the latest evidence that proto-Venus and Earth captured small H$_2$-dominated
primordial atmospheres that were lost by EUV-driven hydrodynamic escape after the disk dispersed.
All relevant thermal and non-thermal atmospheric escape processes that can fractionate various
isotopes and volatile elements are discussed. Erosion of early atmospheres, crust and mantle by
large planetary impactors are also addressed. Further, we discuss how moderately volatile elements
such as the radioactive heat producing element $^{40}$K and other rock-forming elements such as
Mg can also be outgassed and lost from magma oceans that originate on large planetary embryos and
accreting planets. Outgassed elements escape from planetary embryos with masses that are $\geq$\,M$_{\rm
Moon}$ directly, or due to hydrodynamic drag of escaping H atoms originating from primordial- or
steam atmospheres at more massive embryos. We discuss how these processes affect the final elemental
composition and ratios such as K/U, Fe/Mg of early planets and their building blocks. Finally, we
review modeling efforts that constrain the early evolution of Venus, Earth and Mars by reproducing
their measured present day atmospheric $^{36}$Ar/$^{38}$Ar, $^{20}$Ne/$^{22}$Ne noble gas
isotope ratios and the role of isotopes on the loss of water and its connection to the redox state on
early Mars.

Supernova remnants (SNRs) are believed to be the source of Galactic cosmic rays (CRs). SNR shocks
accelerate CR protons and electrons which reveal key insights into the non-thermal physics by means
of their synchrotron and $\gamma$-ray emission. The remnant SN 1006 is an ideal particle acceleration
laboratory because it is observed across all electromagnetic wavelengths from radio to $\gamma$-rays.
We perform three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) simulations where we include CR
protons and follow the CR electron spectrum. By matching the observed morphology and non-thermal
spectrum of SN 1006 in radio, X-rays and $\gamma$-rays, we gain new insight into CR electron acceleration
and magnetic field amplification. 1. We show that a mixed leptonic-hadronic model is responsible
for the $\gamma$-ray radiation: while leptonic inverse-Compton emission and hadronic pion-decay
emission contribute equally at GeV energies observed by Fermi, TeV energies observed by imaging
air Cherenkov telescopes are hadronically dominated. 2. We show that quasi-parallel acceleration
(i.e., when the shock propagates at a narrow angle to the upstream magnetic field) is preferred for
CR electrons and that the electron acceleration efficiency of radio-emitting GeV electrons at
quasi-perpendicular shocks is suppressed at least by a factor ten. This precludes extrapolation
of current one-dimensional plasma particle-in-cell simulations of shock acceleration to realistic
SNR conditions. 3. To match the radial emission profiles and the $\gamma$-ray spectrum, we require
a volume-filling, turbulently amplified magnetic field and that the Bell-amplified magnetic
field is damped in the immediate post-shock region. Our work connects micro-scale plasma physics
simulations to the scale of SNRs.

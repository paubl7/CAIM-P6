Asteroid Ryugu and asteroid Bennu, which were recently visited by spacecraft Hayabusa2 and OSIRIS-REx,
respectively, are spinning top-shaped rubble piles. Other axisymmetric top-shaped near-Earth
asteroids have been observed with ground-based radar, most of which rotate near breakup rotation
periods of ~ 3 hours. This suggests that rotation-induced deformation of asteroids through rotational
spinup produces top shapes. Although some previous simulations using the Discrete Element Method
showed that spinup of rubble piles may produce oblate top shapes, it is still unclear what kinds of
conditions such as friction angles of constituent materials and spinup timescales are required
for top-shape formation. Here we show, through Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics simulations of
granular bodies spinning-up at different rates, that the rotation-induced deformation of spherical
rubble piles before breakup can be classified into three modes according to the friction angle \phi_{d}:
quasi-static and internal deformation for \phi_{d} < 40 degrees, dynamical and internal deformation
for 50 degrees < \phi_{d} < 60 degrees, and surface landslides for \phi_{d} > 70 degrees. Note that
these apparent large values of friction angle can be acceptable if we consider the effect of cohesion
among blocks of a rubble pile under weak gravity. Bodies with \phi_{d} < 60 degrees evolve into oblate
spheroids through internal deformation, but never form pronounced equators defining a top shape.
In contrast, bodies with \phi_{d} > 70 degrees deform into axisymmetric top shapes through an axisymmetric
surface landslides if spinup timescales are < a few days. In addition, through slow spinups with
timescales > 1 month, bodies with \phi_{d} > 70 degrees deform into non-axisymmetric shapes via
localized landslides. We suggest that rapid spinup mechanisms are preferable for the formation
of axisymmetric top shapes.

Spider pulsars are binary systems containing an energetic millisecond pulsar that intensely irradiates
a closely orbiting low-mass companion. Modelling their companion's optical light curves is essential
to the study of the orbital properties of the binary, including the determination of the pulsar mass,
characterising the pulsar wind and the star itself. We aim to generalise the traditional direct
heating model of irradiation, whereby energy deposited by the pulsar wind into the stellar envelope
is locally re-emitted, by introducing heat redistribution via diffusion and convection within
the outer stellar envelope. We approximate the irradiated stellar envelope as a two-dimensional
shell. This allows us to propose an effective equation of energy conservation that can be solved
at a reduced computational cost. We then implement this model in the \texttt{Icarus} software and
use evidence sampling to determine the most likely convection and diffusion laws for the light curve
of the redback companion of PSR J2215+5135. Redistribution effects concentrate near the terminator
line of pulsar irradiation, and can create apparent hot and cold spots. Among the models tested for
PSR J2215+5135, we find that all models with heat redistribution are more likely than symmetric
direct heating. The best-fitting redistribution model involves diffusion together with a uniformly
rotating envelope. However, we caution that all models still present serious systematic effects,
and that prior knowledge from pulsar timing, spectroscopy and distance are key to determine with
certainty the most accurate redistribution law. We propose an extension of the direct heating framework
that allows for exploring a variety of heat redistribution effects. Future work is necessary to
determine the relevant laws from first principles and empirically using complementary observations.

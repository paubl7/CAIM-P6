Measurements of the gravitational-wave signals from neutron star mergers allow scientists to
learn about the interior of neutron stars and the properties of dense nuclear matter. The study of
neutron star mergers is usually performed with computational fluid dynamics codes, mostly in Eulerian
but also in Lagrangian formulation such as smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH). Codes include
our best knowledge of nuclear matter in the form of an equation of state as well as effects of general
relativity (GR). However, one important aspect of neutron stars is usually ignored: the solid nature
of their crust. The solid matter in the crust is the strongest material known in nature which could
lead to a multitude of possible observational effects that have not been studied in dynamical simulations
yet. The crust could change the way a neutron star deforms during a merger, leaving an imprint in the
gravitational wave signal. It could even shatter during the inspiral, producing a potentially
observable electromagnetic signal. Here, we present a first study of the dynamical behavior of
neutron stars with a solid crust and fixed GR background with FleCSPH. FleCSPH is a general-purpose
SPH code, developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. It features an efficient algorithm for gravitational
interactions via the Fast Multipole Method, which, together with the implemented nuclear equation
of state, makes it appropriate for astrophysical applications. The solid material dynamics is
described via the elastic-perfectly plastic model with maximum-strain breaking. Despite its
simplicity, the model reproduces the stress-strain curve of crustal material as extracted from
microphysical simulations very well. We present first tests of our implementation via simulations
of neutron star oscillations and give an outlook on our study of the dynamical behavior of the solid
crust in neutron star merger events.

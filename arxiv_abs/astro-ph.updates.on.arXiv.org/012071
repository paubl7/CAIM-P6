The 11-year solar cycle is the dominant pattern of solar activity reflecting the oscillatory dynamo
mechanism in the Sun. Solar cycles were directly observed since 1700, while indirect proxies suggest
their existence over a much longer period of time but generally without resolving individual cycles
and their continuity. Here we reconstruct individual cycles for the last millennium using recent
14C data and state-of-the-art models. Starting with the 14C production rate determined from the
so far most precise measurements of radiocarbon content in tree rings, solar activity is reconstructed
in three physics-based steps: (1) Correction of the 14C production rate for the changing geomagnetic
field; (2) Computation of the open solar magnetic flux; and (3) Conversion into sunspot numbers
outside of grand minima. Solar activity is reconstructed for the period 971-1900 (85 individual
cycles). This more than doubles the number of solar cycles known from direct solar observations.
We found that lengths and strengths of well-defined cycles outside grand minima are consistent
with those obtained from the direct sunspot observations after 1750. The validity of the Waldmeier
rule is confirmed at a highly significant level. Solar activity is found to be in a deep grand minimum
when the activity is mostly below the sunspot formation threshold, during about 250 years. Therefore,
although considerable cyclic variability in 14C is seen even during grand minima, individual solar
cycles can hardly be reliably resolved therein. Three potential solar particle events, ca. 994,
1052 and 1279 AD, are shown. A new about 1000-year long solar activity reconstruction, in the form
of annual (pseudo) sunspot numbers with full assessment of uncertainties, is presented based on
new high-precision 14C measurements and state-of-the-art models, more than doubling the number
of individually resolved solar cycles.

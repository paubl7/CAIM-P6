Transport processes occurring in the radiative interior of solar-type stars are evidenced by the
surface variation of light elements, in particular Li, and the evolution of their rotation rates.
For the Sun, inversions of helioseismic data indicate that the radial profile of angular velocity
in its radiative zone is nearly uniform, which implies the existence of angular momentum transport
mechanisms. While there are many independent transport models for angular momentum and chemical
species, there is a lack of self-consistent theories that permit stellar evolution models to simultaneously
match the present-day observations of solar lithium abundances and radial rotation profiles.
We explore how additional transport processes can improve the agreement between evolutionary
models of rotating stars and observations. We constrain the resulting models by simultaneously
using the evolution of the surface rotation rate and Li abundance in the solar-type stars of open
clusters, and the solar surface and internal rotation profile as inverted from helioseismology.
We show the relevance of penetrative convection for the depletion of Li. The rotational dependence
of the depth of penetrative convection yields an anti-correlation between the initial rotation
rate and Li depletion in our models of solar-type stars that is in agreement with the observed trend.
Simultaneously, the addition of an ad hoc vertical viscosity leads to efficient transport of angular
momentum between the core and the envelope. We also self-consistently compute for the first time
the thickness of the tachocline and find that it is compatible with helioseismic estimations. However,
the main sequence depletion of Li in solar-type stars is only reproduced when adding a parametric
turbulent mixing below the convective envelope. The need for additional transport processes in
stellar evolution models is confirmed.

The core-envelope models presented in {Ref1}; {Ref2}, corresponding to the values of compactness
parameter, $u \equiv M/a$ = 0.30 and 0.25 (mass to size ratio in geometrized units) have been studied
under slow rotation. It is seen that these models are capable of explaining all the observational
values of glitch healing parameter, $G_h = I_{\rm core}/I_{\rm total} < 0.55$ {Ref3} for the Vela
pulsar. The models yield the maximum values of mass, $M$, surface redshift, $z_a$, and the moment
of inertia, $I_{\rm Vela}$ for the Vela pulsar in the range $M = 3.079M_\odot - 2.263M_\odot$; $z_a
= 0.581 - 0.414$ and $I_{\rm Vela,45} =6.9 - 3.5$ (where $I_{45}=I/10^{45}\rm g{cm}^2$) respectively
for the values of $u = $ 0.30 and 0.25 and for an assigned value of the surface density, $E_a = 2\times
10^{14}\rm g{cm}^{-3}$ {Ref4}. The values of masses lower than the above mentioned values ( so called
the realistic mass range, $M = 1.4\pm0.2 M_\odot$, in the literature) but significantly higher
than that of the unrealistic mass range $M \leq 0.5M_\odot$ (obtained for the Vela pulsar in the literature
on the basis of parametrized neutron star (NS) models based on equations of state (EOSs) of dense
nuclear matter {Ref3}) and other parameters may be obtained likewise for the above mentioned range
of the values of $G_h$ corresponding to the values of $u < 0.25$. The models are found to be causally
consistent, gravitational bound and pulsationally stable. The upper bound on neutron star (NS)
mass obtained in this study which is applicable for the Vela pulsar, in fact, corresponds to the mean
value of the upper bound on NS mass obtained in the classical result {Ref5} and that obtained on the
basis of modern EOSs for neutron star matter {Ref6} and is in a good agreement with the most recent
theoretical estimate {Ref7}.

We present results from full general relativistic three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations
of stellar core collapse of a 70 M$_\odot$ star with spectral neutrino transport. To investigate
the impact of rotation on non-axisymmetric instabilities, we compute three models by parametrically
changing the initial strength of rotation. The most rapidly rotating model exhibits a transient
development of the low-$T/|W|$ instability with one-armed spiral flow at the early postbounce
phase. Subsequently, the two-armed spiral flow appears, which persists during the simulation
time. The moderately rotating model also shows the growth of the low-$T/|W|$ instability, but only
with the two-armed spiral flow. In the nonrotating model, a vigorous activity of the standing accretion-shock
instability (SASI) is only observed. The SASI is first dominated by the sloshing mode, which is followed
by the spiral SASI until the black hole formation. We present a spectrogram analysis of the gravitational
waves (GWs) and neutrinos, focusing on the time correlation. Our results show that characteristic
time modulations in the GW and neutrino signals can be linked to the growth of the non-axisymmetric
instabilities. We find that the degree of the protoneutron star (PNS) deformation, depending upon
which modes of the non-axisymmetric instabilities develop, predominantly affects the characteristic
frequencies of the correlated GW and neutrino signals. We point out that these signals would be simultaneously
detectable by the current-generation detectors up to $\sim10$ kpc. Our findings suggest that the
joint observation of GWs and neutrinos is indispensable for extracting information on the PNS evolution
preceding the black hole formation.

Massive neutrinos suppress the growth of cosmic structure on small, non-linear, scales. It is thus
often proposed that using statistics beyond the power spectrum can tighten constraints on the neutrino
mass by extracting additional information from these non-linear scales. We study the information
content regarding neutrino mass at the field level, quantifying how much of this information arises
from the difference in non-linear evolution between a cosmology with 1 fluid (CDM) and 2 fluids (CDM
+ neutrinos). We do so by running two $N$-body simulations, one with and one without massive neutrinos;
both with the same phases, and matching their linear power spectrum at a given, low, redshift. This
effectively isolates the information encoded in the linear initial conditions from the non-linear
cosmic evolution. We demonstrate that for $k \lesssim 1\,h/{\rm Mpc}$, and for a single redshift,
there is negligible difference in the real-space CDM field between the two simulations. This suggests
that all the information regarding neutrinos is in the linear power spectrum set by the initial conditions.
Thus any probe based on the CDM field alone will have negligible constraining power beyond that which
exists at the linear level over the same range of scales. Consequently, any probe based on the halo
field will contain little information beyond the linear power. We find similar results for the matter
field responsible for weak lensing. We also demonstrate that there may be much information beyond
the power spectrum in the 3d matter field, however, this is not observable in modern surveys via dark
matter halos or weak lensing. Finally, we show that there is additional information to be found in
redshift space.

Context. The mirror tracking system of the Canadian Automated Meteor Observatory (CAMO) can track
meteors in real time, providing an effective angular resolution of 1 arc second and a temporal resolution
of 100 frames per second. Aims. We describe the upgraded hardware and give details of the data calibration
and reduction pipeline. We investigate the influence of meteor morphology on radiant and velocity
measurement precision, and use direct observations of meteoroid fragmentation to constrain their
compressive strengths. Methods. On July 21, 2017, CAMO observed a ~4 second meteor on a JFC orbit.
It had a shallow entry angle ~8 deg and 12 fragments were visible in the narrow-field video. The event
was manually reduced and the exact moment of fragmentation was determined. The aerodynamic ram
pressure at the moment of fragmentation was used as a proxy for compressive strength, and strengths
of an additional 19 fragmenting meteoroids were measured in the same way. The uncertainty in the
atmosphere mass density was estimated to be +/-25% using NAVGEM-HA data. Results. We find that meteor
trajectory accuracy significantly depends on meteor morphology. The CAMO radiant and initial
velocity precision for non-fragmenting meteors with short wakes is ~0.5' and 1 m/s, while that for
meteors with fragments or long wakes is similar to non-tracking, moderate field of view optical
systems (5', ~50 m/s). Measured compressive strengths of 20 fragmenting meteoroids (with less
precise radiants due to their morphology) was in the range of 1-4 kPa, which is in excellent accord
with Rosetta in-situ measurements of 67P. Fragmentation type and strength do not appear to be dependent
on orbit. The mass index of the 12 fragments in the July 21 meteoroid was very high (s = 2.8), indicating
possible progressive fragmentation.

Binary supermassive black holes are expected to be a generic byproduct from hierarchical galaxy
formation. The final coalescence of BSBHs is thought to be the loudest gravitational wave siren
in the universe, yet no confirmed BSBH is known in the GW-dominated regime. While periodic quasars
have been proposed as BSBH candidates, the physical origin of the periodicity has been largely uncertain.
Here we report discovery of a periodicity (P~1607 days) at 99.95% significance in the optical light
curves of a quasar at z=1.53, SDSS J025214.67-002813.7. Combining archival Sloan Digital Sky Survey
data with new, high signal to noise imaging from the Dark Energy Survey, the total ~20yr time baseline
spans ~4.6 cycles of the observed 4.4-yr (restframe 1.7-yr) periodicity. The light curves are best
characterized by a bursty model predicted by hydrodynamic simulations of circumbinary accretion
disks. The periodicity is likely caused by accretion rate variability periodically modulated
by a milli-parsec BSBH emitting gravitational waves while still being dynamically coupled to the
circumbinary accretion disk. A characteristic bursty hydrodynamic variability model is statistically
preferred over a smooth, sinusoidal model expected from relativistic Doppler boost, a kinematic
effect proposed for PG1302-102. Furthermore, the frequency dependence of the variability amplitudes
disfavors Doppler boost as the dominant mechanism, lending independent support to the circumbinary
accretion variability hypothesis. Given our detection rate of one BSBH candidate from circumbinary
accretion variability out of 625 quasars, it suggests that future large, sensitive synoptic surveys
such as the Legacy Survey of Space and Time at Vera C. Rubin Observatory may be able to detect hundreds
to thousands of candidate BSBHs from circumbinary accretion variability with direct implications
for Laser Interferometer Space Antenna.

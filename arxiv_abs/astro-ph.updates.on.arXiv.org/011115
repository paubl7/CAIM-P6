While molecular gas mass is usually derived from $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) - the most fundamental line
to explore molecular gas - it is often derived from $^{12}$CO($J$=2-1) assuming a constant $^{12}$CO($J$=2-1)/$^{12}$CO($J$=1-0)
line ratio ($R_{2/1}$). We present variations of $R_{2/1}$ and effects of the assumption that $R_{2/1}$
is a constant in 24 nearby galaxies using $^{12}$CO data obtained with the Nobeyama 45-m radio telescope
and IRAM 30-m telescope. The median of $R_{2/1}$ for all galaxies is 0.61, and the weighted mean of
$R_{2/1}$ by $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0) integrated-intensity is 0.66 with a standard deviation of 0.19.
The radial variation of $R_{2/1}$ shows that it is high (~0.8) in the inner ~1 kpc while its median
in disks is nearly constant at 0.60 when all galaxies are compiled. In the case that the constant $R_{2/1}$
of 0.7 is adopted, we found that the total molecular gas mass derived from $^{12}$CO($J$=2-1) is
underestimated/overestimated by ~20%, and at most by 35%. The scatter of a molecular gas surface
density within each galaxy becomes larger by ~30%, and at most by 120%. Indices of the spatially resolved
Kennicutt-Schmidt relation by $^{12}$CO($J$=2-1) are underestimated by 10-20%, at most 39% in
17 out of 24 galaxies. $R_{2/1}$ has good positive correlations with star-formation rate and infrared
color, and a negative correlation with molecular gas depletion time. There is a clear tendency of
increasing $R_{2/1}$ with increasing kinetic temperature ($T_{\rm kin}$). Further, we found
that not only $T_{\rm kin}$ but also pressure of molecular gas is important to understand variations
of $R_{2/1}$. Special considerations should be made when discussing molecular gas mass and molecular
gas properties inferred from $^{12}$CO($J$=2-1) instead of $^{12}$CO($J$=1-0).

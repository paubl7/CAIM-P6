BAT99 126 is a multiple system in the Large Magellanic Cloud containing a Wolf-Rayet (WR) star, which
has a reported spectroscopic (orbital) period of 25.5 days and a photometric (orbital) period of
1.55 days, and hence is potentially one of the shortest WR binaries known to date. Such short-period
binary systems containing a WR star in low-metallicity environments are prime candidate progenitors
of black-hole (BH) mergers. By thoroughly analysing the spectroscopic and photometric data, we
aim to establish the true multiplicity of BAT99 126, characterise the orbit(s) of the system, measure
the physical properties of its individual components, and determine the overall evolutionary
status of the system. Using newly acquired high resolution spectra, we measured radial velocities
and performed a spectral analysis of the individual components. We estimated the age of the system
and derived an evolutionary scenario for the 1.55-day system. BAT99 126 comprises at least four
components. The 1.55-day photometric signal originates in an eclipsing O+O binary of spectral
types O4 V and O6.5 V, and masses of 36+/-5 MSun and 15+/-2 MSun, respectively. For the WR star, we derived
a spectral type WN2.5-3 and reject the previously reported 25.5-d period. We find evidence in the
composite spectra of a fourth component, a B1 V star, which shows radial velocity variation. The
configurations of the B-type star, WR star, and possible additional undetected components remain
unknown. We estimated the age of the system to be 4.2 Myr. The O+O binary likely went through a phase
of conservative mass transfer and is currently a near-contact system. We show that BAT99 126 is a
multiple - quadruple or higher-order - system with a total initial mass > 160 MSun. The 1.55-day O+O
binary most likely will not evolve towards a BH+BH merger, but instead will merge before the components
collapse to BHs.

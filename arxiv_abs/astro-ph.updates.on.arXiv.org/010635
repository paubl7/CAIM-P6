Four observations of Starlink's LEO communication satellites, Darksat and STARLINK-1113 were
conducted on two nights with two telescopes. The Chakana 0.6\,m, telescope at the Ckoirama observatory
(Chile) observed both satellites on 2020-03-05 (UTC) and 2020-03-07 (UTC) using a Sloan {\it r'}
and Sloan {\it i'} filter, respectively. The ESO Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy
(VISTA) 4.0\,m telescope with the VISTA InfraRed CAMera (VIRCAM) observed both satellites on 2020/03/05
(UTC) and 2020/03/07 (UTC) in the NIR {\it J}-band and NIR {\it Ks}-band, respectively. The calibration,
image processing, and analysis of the Darksat images give r ~5.6\,mag, i ~5.0\,mag, J ~4.2\,mag,
and Ks ~4.0\,mag when scaled to a range of 550\,km (airmass $=1$) and corrected for the solar incidence
and observer phase angles. In comparison the STARLINK-1113 images give r ~4.9\,mag, i ~4.4\,mag,
J ~3.8\,mag, and Ks ~3.6\,mag when corrected for range, solar incidence and observer phase angles.
The data and results presented in this work, show that the special darkening coating used by Starlink
for Darksat has darkened the Sloan {\it r'} magnitude by 50\,\%, Sloan {\it i'} magnitude by 42\,\%,
NIR J magnitude by 32\,\%, NIR Ks magnitude by 28\,\%. The results show that both satellites increase
in reflective brightness with increasing wavelength and that the effectiveness of the darkening
treatment reduces at longer wavelengths. This shows that the mitigation strategies being developed
by Starlink and other LEO satellite operators need to take into account other wavelengths, not just
the optical/visible. This work highlights the continued importance of obtaining multi-wavelength
observations of many different LEO satellites in order to characterise their reflective properties,
to aid the community in developing impact simulations and develop mitigation tools.

The chemistry of planet-forming disks sets the exoplanet atmosphere composition and the prebiotic
molecular content. Dust traps are of particular importance as pebble growth and transport are crucial
for setting the chemistry where giant planets are forming. The asymmetric Oph IRS 48 dust trap located
at 60 au radius provides a unique laboratory for studying chemistry in pebble-concentrated environments
in warm Herbig disks with low gas-to-dust ratios down to 0.01. We use deep ALMA Band 7 line observations
to search the IRS 48 disk for H$_2$CO and CH$_3$OH line emission, the first steps of complex organic
chemistry. We report the detection of 7 H$_2$CO and 6 CH$_3$OH lines with energy levels between 17
and 260 K. The line emission shows a crescent morphology, similar to the dust continuum, suggesting
that the icy pebbles play an important role in the delivery of these molecules. Rotational diagrams
and line ratios indicate that both molecules originate from warm molecular regions in the disk with
temperatures $>$100 K and column densities $\sim10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ or a fractional abundance
of $\sim10^{-8}$. Based on arguments from a physical-chemical model with low gas-to-dust ratios,
we propose a scenario where the dust trap provides a huge icy grain reservoir in the disk midplane
or an `ice trap', which can result in high gas-phase abundances of warm COMs through efficient vertical
mixing. This is the first time that complex organic molecules have been clearly linked to the presence
of a dust trap. These results demonstrate the importance of including dust evolution and vertical
transport in chemical disk models, as icy dust concentrations provide important reservoirs for
complex organic chemistry in disks.

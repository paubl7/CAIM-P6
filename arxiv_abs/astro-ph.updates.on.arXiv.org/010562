Magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) spectroscopy is central to many astrophysical disciplines, ranging
from helio- to asteroseismology, over solar coronal (loop) seismology, to the study of waves and
instabilities in jets, accretion disks, or solar/stellar atmospheres. MHD spectroscopy quantifies
all linear (standing or travelling) wave modes, including overstable (i.e. growing) or damped
modes, for a given configuration that achieves force and thermodynamic balance. Here, we present
Legolas, a novel, open-source numerical code to calculate the full MHD spectrum of one-dimensional
equilibria with flow, that balance pressure gradients, Lorentz forces, centrifugal effects and
gravity, enriched with non-adiabatic aspects like radiative losses, thermal conduction and resistivity.
The governing equations use Fourier representations in the ignorable coordinates, and the set
of linearised equations are discretised using Finite Elements in the important height or radial
variation, handling Cartesian and cylindrical geometries using the same implementation. A weak
Galerkin formulation results in a generalised (non-Hermitian) matrix eigenvalue problem, and
linear algebraic algorithms calculate all eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors. We showcase
a plethora of well-established results, ranging from p- and g-modes in magnetised, stratified
atmospheres, over modes relevant for coronal loop seismology, thermal instabilities and discrete
overstable Alfv\'en modes related to solar prominences, to stability studies for astrophysical
jet flows. We encounter (quasi-)Parker, (quasi-)interchange, current-driven and Kelvin-Helmholtz
instabilities, as well as non-ideal quasi-modes, resistive tearing modes, up to magneto-thermal
instabilities. The use of high resolution sheds new light on previously calculated spectra, revealing
interesting spectral regions that have yet to be investigated.

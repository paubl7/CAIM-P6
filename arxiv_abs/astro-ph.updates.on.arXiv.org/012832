We continue our program of investigation of the proper motions of spectrally separated structures
in the Herbig-Haro outflows with the aid of Fabry-Perot scanning interferometry. This work mainly
focuses on the physical nature of various structures in the jets. The aim of the present study is to
measure the proper motions of the previously discovered kinematically separated structures in
the working surface of the HH 83 collimated outflow. We used observations from two epochs separated
by 15 years, which were performed on the 6m telescope with Fabry-Perot scanning interferometer.
We obtained images corresponding to different radial velocities for the two separate epochs, and
used them to measure proper motions. In the course of our data analysis, we discovered a counter bow-shock
of HH 83 flow with positive radial velocity, which makes this flow a relatively symmetric bipolar
system. The second epoch observations confirm that the working surface of the flow is split into
two structures with an exceptionally large (250 km\ s$^{-1}$) difference in radial velocity. The
proper motions of these structures are almost equal, which suggests that they are physically connected.
The asymmetry of the bow shock and the turning of proper motion vectors suggests a collision between
the outflow and a dense cloud. The profile of the H$\alpha$ line for the directly invisible infrared
source HH 83 IRS, obtained by integration of the data within the reflection nebula, suggests it to
be of P Cyg type with a broad absorption component characteristic of the FU Ori like objects. If this
object underwent an FU Ori type outburst, which created the HH 83 working surfaces, its eruption
took place about 1500 years ago according to the kinematical age of the outflow.

The chromosphere is a partially ionized layer of the solar atmosphere, the transition between the
photosphere where the gas motion is determined by the gas pressure and the corona dominated by the
magnetic field. We study the effect of partial ionization for 2D wave propagation in a gravitationally
stratified, magnetized atmosphere with properties similar to the solar chromosphere. We adopt
an oblique uniform magnetic field in the plane of propagation with strength suitable for a quiet
sun region. The theoretical model used is a single fluid magnetohydrodynamic approximation, where
ion-neutral interaction is modeled by the ambipolar diffusion term. Magnetic energy can be converted
into internal energy through the dissipation of the electric current produced by the drift between
ions and neutrals. We use numerical simulations where we continuously drive fast waves at the bottom
of the atmosphere. The collisional coupling between ions and neutrals decreases with the decrease
of the density and the ambipolar effect becomes important. Fast waves excited at the base of the atmosphere
reach the equipartition layer and reflect or transmit as slow waves. While the waves propagate through
the atmosphere and the density drops, the waves steepen into shocks. The main effect of ambipolar
diffusion is damping of the waves. We find that for the parameters chosen in this work, the ambipolar
diffusion affects the fast wave before it is reflected, with damping being more pronounced for waves
which are launched in a direction perpendicular to the magnetic field. Slow waves are less affected
by ambipolar effects. The damping increases for shorter periods and larger magnetic field strengths.
Small scales produced by the nonlinear effects and the superposition of different types of waves
created at the equipartition height are efficiently damped by ambipolar diffusion.

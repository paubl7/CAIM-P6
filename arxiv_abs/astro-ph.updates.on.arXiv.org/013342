We present new images and continuum spectral analysis for 14 resolved Galactic SNRs selected from
the 74 MHz Very Large Array Low-Frequency Sky Survey Redux (VLSSr). We combine new integrated measurements
from the VLSSr with flux densities extracted from the GLEAM and measurements from the literature
to generate improved continuum spectra. We combine the VLSSr images with publicly available images
at 1.4 GHz, to analyse the resolved morphology and spectral index distribution across each SNR.
Three of the SNRs, Kepler, G28.6-0.1, and Tycho, have integrated spectra which can be adequately
fit with simple power laws. The resolved spectral index map for Tycho confirms internal absorption
which was previously detected by the LOFAR, but it is insufficient to affect the fit to the integrated
spectrum. For the pulsar wind nebulae G21.5-0.9 and 3C58 we identify high-frequency spectral breaks
at 38 and 12 GHz, respectively. A low frequency spectral turnover adequately fits the data of the
remaining nine SNRs. For Kes 67, Kes 69, Kes75, and 3C397, we attribute the absorption to ionised
gas along the line of sight, possibly from extended HII region envelopes. For W41 the absorption
can be attributed to HII regions located in its immediate proximity. Thermal absorption from interactions
at the ionised interface between SNR forward shocks and the surrounding medium were previously
identified as responsible for the low frequency turnover in SNR 3C391; our integrated spectrum
is consistent with the previous results. We present evidence for the same phenomenon in three additional
SNRs, Kes73, W49B, and 3C396, and derive constraints on the physical properties of the interaction.
This result indicates that interactions between SNRs and their environs should be readily detectable
through thermal absorption by future low frequency observations of SNRs with improved sensitivity
and resolution.

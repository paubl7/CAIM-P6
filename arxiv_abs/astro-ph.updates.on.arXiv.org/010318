We measure FIR emission from tails of stripped dust following the ionised and atomic gas components
in galaxies undergoing ram pressure stripping. We study the dust-to-gas relative distribution
and mass ratio in the stripped interstellar medium and relate them to those of the intra-cluster
medium, thus linking the cluster-ICM-galaxy evolution at small-scales. The galaxy sample consists
of three Scd Virgo galaxies with stellar masses in the range $10^9\lesssim \mathrm{M_{*}} \lesssim
10^{10}\, \mathrm{M_{\odot}}$, and within 1 Mpc from the cluster centre, namely NGC 4330, NGC 4522,
and NGC 4654. Through the analysis of VESTIGE H$\alpha$, $Herschel$ SPIRE far-infrared, and VIVA
HI data, we trace the spatial distribution of the tails and infer the dust and gas masses from the measured
far-infrared 250 $\mu$m and HI flux densities. Dust-to-gas mass ratios (DGRs) in the tails are analysed
as a function of the galaxy mass, metallicity, and dust temperature. Along the stripped component,
the dust distribution closely follows the HI and H$\alpha$ emitting gas, all extending beyond the
optical disc. In these regions, the DGRs are $2.0\pm0.6\times10^{-3}$, $0.7\pm0.1\times10^{-3}$,
and $0.4\pm0.03\times10^{-3}$, for NGC 4330, NGC 4522, and NGC 4654, respectively, i.e. up to a
factor of 15 less than the values measured in the main body of nearby galaxies. We also find a negative
trend in the DGR as a function of the metallicity that can be explained in terms of a dust component
more centrally concentrated in more metal-rich systems. Together with the finding that the stripped
dust is cold, $T_{d} \lesssim 25\, K$, our results support an outside-in stripping scenario of the
galaxy interstellar medium. This study shows that ram pressure stripping is a key mechanism in the
building up of the Virgo intra-cluster component injecting dust grains into the ICM, thus contributing
to its metal enrichment.

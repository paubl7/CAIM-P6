Interstellar objects (ISOs), the parent population of 1I/Oumuamua and 2I/Borisov, are abundant
in the interstellar medium of the Milky Way. This means that the interstellar medium, including
molecular cloud regions, has three components: gas, dust, and ISOs. From the observational constraints
for the field density of ISOs drifting in the solar neighbourhood, we infer a typical molecular cloud
of 10 pc diameter contains some 10$^{18}$ ISOs. At typical sizes ranging from hundreds of metres
to tens of km, ISOs are entirely decoupled from the gas dynamics in these molecular clouds. Here we
address the question of whether ISOs can follow the collapse of molecular clouds. We perform low-resolution
simulations of the collapse of molecular clouds containing initially static ISO populations toward
the point where stars form. In this proof-of-principle study, we find that the interstellar objects
definitely follow the collapse of the gas -- and many become bound to the new-forming numerical approximations
to future stars (sinks). At minimum, 40\% of all sinks have one or more ISO test particles gravitationally
bound to them for the initial ISO distributions tested here. This value corresponds to at least $10^{10}$
actual interstellar objects being bound after three initial free-fall times. Thus, ISOs are a relevant
component of star formation. We find that more massive sinks bind disproportionately large fractions
of the initial ISO population, implying competitive capture of ISOs. Sinks can also be solitary,
as their ISOs can become unbound again -- particularly if sinks are ejected from the system. Emerging
planetary systems will thus develop in remarkably varied environments, ranging from solitary
to richly populated with bound ISOs.

We analyze high-resolution (400pc) 220GHz continuum and CO(2-1) ALMA observations of a representative
sample of 22 local (z<0.165) ULIRG systems (32 individual nuclei) as part of the "Physics of ULIRGs
with MUSE and ALMA" (PUMA) project. The deconvolved half-light radii of the 220GHz continuum sources
are between <60-350 pc (median 90pc). We associate these regions with the regions emitting the bulk
of the infrared luminosity. The good agreement, within a factor of 2, between the 220GHz fluxes and
the extrapolation of the infrared gray-body, and the small synchrotron and free-free contributions
support this assumption. The cold molecular gas emission sizes are 60-700 pc and are on average 2.6
times larger than the continuum. We derive L_IR and cold molecular gas surface densities: log Sigma(L_IR)=11.5-14.3
Lsun/kpc^2 and log Sigma(H2)=2.9-4.2 Msun/pc^2. Assuming that the L_IR is produced by star-formation,
this corresponds to median Sigma(SFR)=2500 Msun/yr/kpc^2 which would imply extremely short depletion
times, <1-15 Myr, and unphysical SF efficiencies >1 for 70% of the sample. Therefore, this favors
the presence of obscured AGN that could dominate the L_IR. We also classify the ULIRG nuclei in two
groups: (a) compact nuclei (r<130 pc) with high mid-IR excess emission found in optically classified
AGN; and (b) nuclei following a relation with decreasing mid-IR excess for decreasing r. The majority,
65%, of the interacting nuclei lie in the low end (<130 pc) of this relation, while only 25% of the advanced
mergers do so. This suggests that in the early stages of the interaction, the activity occurs in more
compact and dust-obscured regions than in advanced merger stages. Approximately two thirds of
the nuclei are above the Eddington limit which is consistent with the detection of massive outflows
in local ULIRGs and the potential role of radiation pressure in the launching process.

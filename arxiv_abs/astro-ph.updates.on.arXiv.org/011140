Non-Gaussian cosmic shear statistics based on weak-lensing aperture mass ($M_{\rm ap}$) maps
can outperform the classical shear two-point correlation function ($\gamma$-2PCF) in terms of
cosmological constraining power. Reaching the full potential of these new estimators however
requires an accurate modeling of the physics of baryons as the extra non-Gaussian information mostly
reside at small scales. We present one such modeling based on the Magneticum hydrodynamical simulation
for the KiDS-450, DES-Y1, and a Euclid-like surveys. We compute the bias due to baryons on the lensing
PDF and the distribution of peaks and voids in $M_{\rm ap}$ maps and propagate it to the cosmological
forecasts on the structure growth parameter $S_8$, the matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm
m}$ and the dark energy equation of state $w_0$, using the SLICS and cosmo-SLICS sets of dark matter
only simulations. We report a negative bias of a few percents on $S_8$ and $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and also
measure a positive bias of the same level on $w_0$ when including a tomographic decomposition. These
biases are increased to the order of $\sim 5$% when combining $M_{\rm ap}$ statistics with the $\gamma$-2PCF
as these estimators show similar dependency on the AGN feedback. We verify that these biases constitute
less than a $1\sigma$ shift on the probed cosmological parameters for current cosmic shear surveys.
Baryons, however, need to be accounted for at the percent level for future Stage IV surveys and we
propose to include uncertainty on the AGN feedback amplitude by marginalizing over this parameter
using multiple simulations such as those presented in this paper. Finally, we explore the possibility
of mitigating the impact of baryons by filtering the $M_{\rm ap}$ map but find that this process would
require to suppress the small-scale information to a point where the constraints would no longer
be competitive.

Context: The unprecedented astrometric precision of the Gaia mission relies on accurate estimates
of the locations of sources in the Gaia data stream. This is ultimately performed by point spread
function (PSF) fitting, which in turn requires an accurate reconstruction of the PSF. Gaia Early
Data Release 3 (EDR3) will, for the first time, use a PSF calibration that models several of the strongest
dependences, leading to signficantly reduced systematic errors. Aims: We describe the PSF model
and calibration pipeline implemented for Gaia EDR3, including an analysis of the calibration results
over the 34 months of data. We include a discussion of the limitations of the current pipeline and
directions for future releases. This will be of use both to users of Gaia data and as a reference for
other precision astrometry missions. Methods: We develop models of the 1D line spread function
(LSF) and 2D PSF profiles based on a linear combination of basis components. We fit the models to selected
primary sources in independent time ranges, using simple parameterisations for the colour and
other dependences. Variation in time is smoothed by merging the independent calibrations in a square
root information filter, with resets at certain mission events that induce a discontinuous change
in the PSF. Results: The PSF calibration shows strong time and colour dependences that accurately
reproduce the varying state of the Gaia astrometric instrument. Analysis of the residuals reveals
both the performance and the limitations of the current models and calibration pipeline, and indicates
the directions for future development. Conclusions: The PSF modelling and calibration carried
out for Gaia EDR3 represents a major step forwards in the data processing and will lead to reduced
systematic errors in the core mission data products. Further significant improvements are expected
in the future data releases.

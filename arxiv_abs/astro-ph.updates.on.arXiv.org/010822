The discovery of Gateway Centaur P/2019 LD2 (ATLAS) (Sarid et al., 2019) provides the first opportunity
to observe the orbital migration of a Solar System small body from a Centaur orbit to a Jupiter Family
Comet (JFC) some four decades from now (Kareta et al., 2020, Hsieh et al., 2020.) The Gateway transition
region is beyond where water ice can power cometary activity, so coma production there is as poorly
understood as in all Centaurs. We present contemporaneous multi-wavelength observations of LD2
from 2020 July 2-4: Gemini North visible imaging, NASA IRTF near-infrared spectroscopy, and ARO
Sub-Millimeter Telescope millimeter-wavelength spectroscopy. Precovery DECam images limit
the nucleus's effective radius to $\sim$ 1.2 km or less and Catalina Sky Survey archival data show
only smooth changes in brightness. The observed colors of LD2's coma are $g' - r' = 0.70 \pm 0.07$ and
$r' - i' = 0.26 \pm 0.07$ with a dust production rate of $\sim 10-20$ kg/s. We used LD2's coma morphology
to estimate the dust coma's outflow velocity between $ v \sim 0.6-3.3$ m/s. We do not detect CO towards
LD2, giving a 2020 Jul 2-3 production rate upper limit of $Q(CO) < $ 3.8 x 10$^{27}$ mol s$^{-1}$ (3-$\sigma$).
The near-infrared spectra show evidence for water ice at the 1-10\% level depending on grain size.
Spatial profiles and archival data support the idea of ongoing consistent activity. The evidence
supports the hypothesis that LD2 is a typical small Centaur that will become a typical JFC, and thus
LD2 is critical to understanding the transition between these two populations. Finally, we discuss
strategies for taking advantage of the windfall of cometary science from a community-wide, long
baseline monitoring effort of P/2019 LD2.

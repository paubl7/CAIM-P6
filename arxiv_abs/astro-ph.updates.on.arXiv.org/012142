There are only few very-high-energy sources in our Galaxy which might accelerate particles up to
the knee of the cosmic-ray spectrum. To understand the mechanisms of particle acceleration in these
PeVatron candidates, \textit{Fermi}-LAT and H.E.S.S. observations are essential to characterize
their $\gamma$-ray emission. HESS J1640$-$465 and the PeVatron candidate HESS J1641$-$463 are
two neighboring (\ang[astroang]{0.25}) $\gamma$-ray sources, spatially coincident with the
radio supernova remnants (SNRs) G338.3$-$0.0 and G338.5+0.1. Detected both by H.E.S.S. and \textit{Fermi}-LAT,
we present here a morphological and spectral analysis of these two sources using 8 years of \textit{Fermi}-LAT
data between 200 \si{\mega\electronvolt} and 1 \si{\tera\electronvolt} with multi-wavelength
observations to assess their nature. The morphology of HESS J1640$-$465 is described by a 2D Gaussian
($\sigma=$ \ang[astroang]{0.053} $\pm$ \ang[astroang]{0.011}$_{stat}$ $ \pm$ \ang[astroang]{0.03}$_{syst}$)
and its spectrum is modeled by a power-law with a spectral index $\Gamma = 1.8\pm0.1_{\rm stat}\pm0.2_{\rm
syst}$. HESS J1641$-$463 is detected as a point-like source and its GeV emission is described by
a logarithmic-parabola spectrum with $\alpha = 2.7 \pm 0.1_ {\rm stat} \pm 0.2_ {\rm syst} $ and significant
curvature of $\beta = 0.11 \pm 0.03_ {\rm stat} \pm 0.05_ {\rm syst} $. Radio and X-ray flux upper limits
were derived. We investigated scenarios to explain their emission, namely the emission from accelerated
particles within the SNRs spatially coincident with each source, molecular clouds illuminated
by cosmic rays from the close-by SNRs, and a pulsar/PWN origin. Our new \emph{Fermi}-LAT results
and the radio and flux X-ray upper limits pose severe constraints on some of these models.

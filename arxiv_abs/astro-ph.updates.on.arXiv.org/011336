Brown dwarfs and directly imaged exoplanets exhibit observational evidence for active atmospheric
circulation, raising critical questions about mechanisms driving the circulation, its fundamental
nature, and time variability. Our previous work demonstrated the crucial role of cloud radiative
feedback on driving a vigorous atmospheric circulation using local models that assume a Cartesian
geometry and constant Coriolis parameters. In this study, we explore the properties of the global
dynamics. We show that, under relatively strong dissipation in the bottom layers of the model, horizontally
isotropic vortices are prevalent at mid-to-high latitudes while large-scale zonally propagating
waves are dominant at low latitudes near the observable layers. The equatorial waves have both eastward
and westward phase speeds, and the eastward components with typical speeds of a few hundred m/s usually
dominate the equatorial time variability. Lightcurves of the global simulations show variability
with amplitudes from 0.5 percent to a few percent depending on the rotation period and viewing angle.
The time evolution of simulated lightcurves is critically affected by the equatorial waves, showing
wave beating effects and differences in the lightcurve periodicity to the intrinsic rotation period.
The vertical extent of clouds is the largest at the equator and decreases poleward due to the increasing
influence of rotation with increasing latitude. Under weaker bottom dissipation, strong and broad
zonal jets develop and modify wave propagation and lightcurve variability. Our modeling results
help to explain the puzzling time evolution of observed lightcurves, a slightly shorter period
of variability in IR than in radio wavelengths, and the viewing angle dependence of variability
amplitude and IR colors.

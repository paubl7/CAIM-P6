Understanding the formation of bound star clusters with low star-formation efficiency is very
important to know about the star-formation history of galaxies. In N-body models of star cluster
evolution after gas expulsion, the Plummer model with outer power law density profile has been used
massively. We study the impact of the density profile slopes on the survivability of the low-SFE
star clusters after instantaneous gas expulsion. We compare cases when stellar cluster has Plummer
profile and Dehnen profiles with cusp of different slopes at the time of formation. We recover the
corresponding density profile of the residual gas for a given global SFE, assuming that our model
clusters formed with a constant efficiency per free-fall time. The latter results on shallower
slope of gas than stars. We perform direct $N$-body simulations of evolution of clusters in virial
equilibrium together with gas potential after gas removal. We find that the violent relaxation
lasts no longer than 20~Myr independent of the density profile power law slopes. Dehnen model clusters
survive after violent relaxation with significantly low SFEs when the global SFE measured within
the Jacobi radius or within a half-mass radius. Dehnen $\gamma=0$ model clusters show similar final
bound fraction with the Plummer model clusters if global SFE is measured within 10 scale radii. The
final bound fraction increases with $\gamma$ values for a given global SFE. We conclude that Dehnen
clusters better resist the consequences of the violent relaxation followed the instantaneous
gas expulsion than the Plummer clusters. Thus the shallower the outer density slope of the low-SFE
clusters, the better for their survivability after gas expulsion. Among Dehnen clusters we find
that the steeper the inner slope (cusp) the higher the bound mass fraction is retained after violent
relaxation for a given global SFE.

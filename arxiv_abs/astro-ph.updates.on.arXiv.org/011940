We present the detection and analysis of the phase curve of KELT-1b at optical wavelengths, analyzing
data taken by the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS). With a mass of ~27 M_J, KELT-1b is
a low-mass brown dwarf. Due to the high mass and close proximity of its companion, the host star has
a TESS light curve which shows clear ellipsoidal variations. We model the data with a six-component
model: secondary eclipse, phase curve accounting for reflected light and thermal emission, Doppler
beaming, ellipsoidal variations, stellar activity and the primary transit. We determine the secondary
eclipse depth in the TESS bandpass to be 304 +/- 75 parts-per-million (ppm), the most accurate eclipse
depth determined so far for KELT-1b. We measure the amplitude of the phase curve to be 128 +/- 27 ppm,
with a corresponding eastward offset between the region of maximum brightness and the substellar
point of 19.2 +/- 9.6 degrees, in good agreement with Spitzer measurements. We determine day and
night brightness temperatures of 3201 +/- 147 K and 1484 +/- 110 K, respectively, slightly higher
than those from Spitzer 3.6 and 4.5 micrometer data. A one-dimensional self-consistent atmospheric
model can explain the TESS and Spitzer day side brightness temperatures with thermal emission alone
and no reflected light. The night side data can be explained by a model with an internal temperature
of ~1100 K, which may be related to the inflated radius. The difference between the TESS and Spitzer
brightness temperatures can be explained by stronger molecular opacity in the Spitzer bands. On
the night side, this opacity is due primarily to CH4 and CO while on the day side it is due to H2-H2 and
H2-He collision-induced absorption.

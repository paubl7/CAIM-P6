In this paper, we present the observations of two new GW Vir stars from the extended \textit{TESS}
mission in both 120\,s short-cadence and 20\,s ultra-short-cadence mode of two pre-white dwarf
stars showing hydrogen deficiency. We performed an asteroseismological analysis of these stars
on the basis of PG~1159 evolutionary models that take into account the complete evolution of the
progenitor stars. We searched for patterns of uniform period spacings in order to constrain the
stellar mass of the stars, and employed the individual observed periods to search for a representative
seismological model. The analysis of the {\it TESS} light curves of TIC\,333432673 and TIC\,095332541
reveals the presence of several oscillations with periods ranging from 350 to 500~s associated
to typical gravity ($g$)-modes. From follow-up ground-based spectroscopy, we find that both stars
have similar effective temperature ($T_\mathrm{eff} = 120,000 \pm 10,000$\,K) and surface gravity
($\log g = 7.5 \pm 0.5$) but a different He/C composition. On the basis of PG~1159 evolutionary tracks,
we derived a spectroscopic mass of $M_{\star}$ = $0.58^{+0.16}_{-0.08}\,M_{\odot}$ for both
stars. Our asteroseismological analysis of TIC\,333432673 allowed us to find a constant period
spacing compatible with a stellar mass $M_{\star}\sim 0.60-0.61\,M_{\odot}$, and an asteroseismological
model for this star with a stellar mass $M_{\star}$ = $0.589\pm 0.020$ $M_{\odot}$, and a seismological
distance of $d= 459^{+188}_{-156}$ pc. For this star, we find an excellent agreement between the
different methods to infer the stellar mass, and also between the seismological distance and that
measured with {\it Gaia} ($d_{\rm Gaia}= 389^{+5.6}_{-5.2}$ pc). For TIC\,095332541, we have
found a possible period spacing that suggests a stellar mass of $M_{\star}\sim 0.55-0.57\,M_{\odot}$.

The chemical pathways linking the small organic molecules commonly observed in molecular clouds
to the large, complex, polycyclic species long-suspected to be carriers of the ubiquitous unidentified
infrared emission bands remain unclear. To investigate whether the formation of mono- and poly-cyclic
molecules observed in cold cores could form via the bottom-up reaction of ubiquitous carbon-chain
species with, e.g. atomic hydrogen, a search is made for possible intermediates in data taken as
part of the GOTHAM (GBT Observations of TMC-1 Hunting for Aromatic Molecules) project. Markov-Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) Source Models were run to obtain column densities and excitation temperatures.
Astrochemical models were run to examine possible formation routes, including a novel grain-surface
pathway involving the hydrogenation of C$_6$N and HC$_6$N, as well as purely gas-phase reactions
between C$_3$N and both propyne (CH$_3$CCH) and allene (CH$_2$CCH$_2$), as well as via the reaction
CN + H$_2$CCCHCCH. We report the first detection of cyanoacetyleneallene (H$_2$CCCHC$_3$N) in
space toward the TMC-1 cold cloud using the Robert C. Byrd 100 m Green Bank Telescope (GBT). Cyanoacetyleneallene
may represent an intermediate between less-saturated carbon-chains, such as the cyanopolyynes,
that are characteristic of cold cores and the more recently-discovered cyclic species like cyanocyclopentadiene.
Results from our models show that the gas-phase allene-based formation route in particular produces
abundances of H$_2$CCCHC$_3$N that match the column density of $2\times10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ obtained
from the MCMC Source Model, and that the grain-surface route yields large abundances on ices that
could potentially be important as precursors for cyclic molecules.

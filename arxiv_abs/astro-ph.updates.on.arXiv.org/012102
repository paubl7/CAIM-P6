There is observational evidence of the presence of small-amplitude transverse magnetohydrodynamic
(MHD) waves with a wide range of frequencies in the threads of solar prominences. It is believed that
the waves are driven at the photosphere and propagate along the magnetic field lines up to prominences
suspended in the corona. The dissipation of MHD wave energy in the partially ionized prominence
plasma is a heating mechanism whose relevance needs to be explored. Here we consider a simple 1D model
for a non-uniform thin thread and investigate the heating associated with dissipation of Alfven
waves. The model assumes an ad hoc density profile and a uniform pressure, while the temperature
and ionization degree are self-consistently computed considering either LTE or non-LTE approximations
for the hydrogen ionization. A broadband driver for Alfven waves is placed at one end of the magnetic
field line, representing photospheric excitation. The Alfvenic perturbations along the thread
are obtained by solving the linearized MHD equations for a partially ionized plasma in the single-fluid
approximation.We find that wave heating in the partially ionized part of the thread is significant
enough to compensate for energy losses due to radiative cooling. A greater amount of heating is found
in the LTE case because the ionization degree for core prominence temperatures is lower than that
in the non-LTE approximation. This results in a greater level of dissipation due to ambipolar diffusion
in the LTE case. Conversely, in the hot coronal part of the model, the plasma is fully ionized and wave
heating is negligible. The results of this simple model suggest that MHD wave heating can be relevant
for the energy balance in prominences. Further studies based on more elaborate models are required.

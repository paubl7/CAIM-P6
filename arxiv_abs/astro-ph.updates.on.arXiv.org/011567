We present a rapid analytic framework for predicting kilonova light curves following neutron star
(NS) mergers, where the main input parameters are binary-based properties measurable by gravitational
wave detectors (chirp mass and mass ratio, orbital inclination) and properties dependent on the
nuclear equation of state (tidal deformability, maximum NS mass). This enables synthesis of a kilonova
sample for any NS source population, or determination of the observing depth needed to detect a live
kilonova given gravitational wave source parameters in low latency. We validate this code, implemented
in the public MOSFiT package, by fitting it to GW170817. A Bayes factor analysis overwhelmingly
($B>10^{10}$) favours the inclusion of an additional luminosity source during the first day, well
fit by a shock-heated cocoon, alongside lanthanide-poor dynamical ejecta. The emission thereafter
is dominated by a lanthanide-rich viscous wind. We find the mass ratio of the binary is $q=0.92\pm0.07$
(90% credible interval). We place tight constraints on the maximum stable NS mass, $M_{\rm TOV}=2.17^{+0.08}_{-0.11}$
M$_\odot$. For a uniform prior in tidal deformability, the radius of a 1.4 M$_\odot$ NS is $R_{1.4}\sim
10.7$ km. Re-weighting with a prior based on equations of state that support our credible range in
$M_{\rm TOV}$, we derive a final measurement $R_{1.4}=11.06^{+1.01}_{-0.98}$ km. Applying our
code to the second gravitationally-detected neutron star merger, GW190425, we estimate that an
associated kilonova would have been fainter (by $\sim0.7$ mag at one day post-merger) and declined
faster than GW170817, underlining the importance of tuning follow-up strategies individually
for each GW-detected NS merger.

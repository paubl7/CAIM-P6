We present comprehensive, multi-wavelength observations of AT 2016jbu, an interacting transient.
High cadence photometric coverage reveals that AT 2016jbu underwent significant photometric
variability followed by two luminous events, the latter of which reached an absolute magnitude
of M$_V\sim$-18.5 mag. This is similar to the transient SN 2009ip whose nature is still debated.
Spectra are dominated by narrow emission lines and show a blue continuum during the peak of the second
event. AT 2016jbu shows signatures of a complex, non-homogeneous circumstellar material (CSM).
We see slowly evolving asymmetric hydrogen line profiles, with velocities of 500 km $s^{-1}$ seen
in narrow emission features from a slow moving CSM, and up to 10,000 km $s^{-1}$ seen in broad absorption
from some high velocity material. Similar velocities are seen in other SN 2009ip-like transients.
Late-time spectra ($\sim$+1 year) show a lack of forbidden emission lines expected from a core-collapse
supernova during the nebular phase and are dominated by strong emission from H, He I and Ca II. Strong
asymmetric emission features, a bumpy lightcurve, and continually evolving spectra suggest late
time CSM interaction is inhibiting the emergence of any nebular features. We compare the evolution
of H$\alpha$ among SN 2009ip-like transients and find possible evidence for orientation angle
effects. The light-curve evolution of AT 2016jbu suggests similar, but not identical, circumstellar
environments to other SN 2009ip-like transients. In Paper II we continue the discussion of AT 2016jbu
and SN 2009ip-like transients and using the data presented here, we focus on the local environment,
the progenitor, and on modelling the transient itself.

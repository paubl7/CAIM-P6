We recommend that the planetary science and space exploration community engage in a robust reevaluation
concerning the ethics of how future crewed and uncrewed missions to the Moon and Mars will interact
with those planetary environments. This should occur through a process of community input, with
emphasis on how such missions can resist colonial structures. Such discussions must be rooted in
the historical context of the violent colonialism in the Americas and across the globe that has accompanied
exploration of Earth. The structures created by settler colonialism are very much alive today,
impact the scientific community, and are currently replicated in the space exploration communities'
plans for human exploration and in-situ resource utilization. These discussions must lead to enforceable
planetary protection policies that create a framework for ethical exploration of other worlds.
Current policy does not adequately address questions related to in-situ resource utilization
and environmental preservation and is without enforcement mechanisms. Further, interactions
with potential extraterrestrial life have scientific and moral stakes. Decisions on these topics
will be made in the coming decade as the Artemis program enables frequent missions to the Moon and
crewed missions to Mars. Those first choices will have irreversible consequences for the future
of human space exploration and must be extremely well considered, with input from those beyond the
scientific community, including expertise from the humanities and members of the general public.
Without planetary protection policy that actively resists colonial practices, they will be replicated
in our interactions and exploration of other planetary bodies. The time is now to engage in these
difficult conversations and disrupt colonial practices within our field so that they are not carried
to other worlds.

We report on the Balloonborne Investigation of Temperature and Speed of Electrons in the corona
(BITSE) mission launched recently to observe the solar corona from about 3 Rs to 15 Rs at four wavelengths
(393.5, 405.0, 398.7, and 423.4 nm). The BITSE instrument is an externally occulted single stage
coronagraph developed at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in collaboration with the Korea Astronomy
and Space Science Institute (KASI). BITSE used a polarization camera that provided polarization
and total brightness images of size 1024 x 1024 pixels. The Wallops Arc Second Pointing (WASP) system
developed at NASA's Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) was used for Sun-pointing. The coronagraph and
WASP were mounted on a gondola provided by WFF and launched from the Fort Sumner, New Mexico station
of Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility (CSBF) on September 18, 2019. BITSE obtained 17,060 coronal
images at a float altitude of about 128,000 feet (39 km) over a period of about 4 hrs. BITSE flight software
was based on NASA's core Flight System, which was designed to help develop flight quality software.
We used EVTM (Ethernet Via Telemetry) to download science data during operations; all images were
stored onboard using flash storage. At the end of the mission, all data were recovered and analyzed.
Preliminary analysis shows that BITSE imaged the solar minimum corona with the equatorial streamers
on the east and west limbs. The narrow streamers observed by BITSE are in good agreement with the geometric
properties obtained by SOHO coronagraphs in the overlapping physical domain. In spite of the small
signal-to-noise ratio (about 14) we were able to obtain the temperature and flow speed of the western
steamer region in the range 4 to 7 Rs as: For the equatorial streamer on the west limb, we obtained a
temperature of 1.0 +/- 0.3 MK and a flow speed of about 260 km/s with a large uncertainty interval.

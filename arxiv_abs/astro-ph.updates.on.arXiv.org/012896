Stellar activity is inherently time variable, therefore simultaneous measurements are necessary
to study the correlation between different activity indicators. In this study we compare X-ray
fluxes measured within the first all-sky survey conducted by the extended ROentgen Survey with
an Imaging Telescope Array (eROSITA) instrument on board the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory
to Ca II H & K, excess flux measurements R+, using observations made with the robotic TIGRE telescope.
We created the largest sample of simultaneous X-ray and spectroscopic Ca II H & K observations of
late-type stars obtained so far, and in addition, previous measurements of Ca II H & K for all sample
stars were obtained. We find the expected correlation between our log(L_X/L_bol) to log(R+) measurements,
but when the whole stellar ensemble is considered, the correlation between coronal and chromospheric
activity indicators does not improve when the simultaneously measured data are used. A more detailed
analysis shows that the correlation of log(L_X/L_bol) to log(R+) measurements of the pseudo-simultaneous
data still has a high probability of being better than that of a random set of non-simultaneous measurements
with a long time baseline between the observations. Cyclic variations on longer timescales are
therefore far more important for the activity flux-flux relations than short-term variations
in the form of rotational modulation or flares, regarding the addition of "noise" to the activity
flux-flux correlations. Finally, regarding the question of predictability of necessarily space-based
log(L_X/L_bol) measurements by using ground-based chromospheric indices, we present a relation
for estimating log(L_X/L_bol) from R+ values and show that the expected error in the calculated
minus observed (C-O) log(L_X/L_bol) values is 0.35 dex.

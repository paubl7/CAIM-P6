Mid-infrared imaging traces the sub-micron and micron sized dust grains in protoplanetary disks
and it offers constraints on the geometrical properties of the disks and potential companions,
particularly if those companions have circumplanetary disks. We use the VISIR instrument and its
upgrade NEAR on the VLT to take new mid-infrared images of five (pre-)transition disks and one circumstellar
disk with proposed planets and obtain the deepest resolved mid-infrared observations to date in
order to put new constraints on the sizes of the emitting regions of the disks and the presence of possible
companions. We derotate and stack the data to find the disk properties. Where available we compare
the data to ProDiMo (Protoplanetary Disk Model) radiation thermo-chemical models to achieve a
deeper understanding of the underlying physical processes within the disks. We apply the circularised
PSF subtraction method to find upper limits on the fluxes of possible companions and model companions
with circumplanetary disks. We resolve three of the six disks and calculate position angles, inclinations
and (upper limits to) sizes of emission regions in the disks, improving upper limits on two of the
unresolved disks. In all cases the majority of the mid-IR emission comes from small inner disks or
the hot inner rims of outer disks. We refine the existing ProDiMo HD 100546 model SED fit in the mid-IR
by increasing the PAH abundance relative to the ISM, adopting coronene as the representative PAH,
and increase the outer cavity radius to 22.3 AU. We produce flux estimates for putative planetary-mass
companions and circumplanetary disks, ruling out the presence of planetary-mass companions with
$L > 0.0028 L_{\odot}$ for $a > 180$ AU in the HD 100546 system. Upper limits of 0.5 mJy-30 mJy are obtained
at 8 $\mu$m-12 $\mu$m for potential companions in the different disks.

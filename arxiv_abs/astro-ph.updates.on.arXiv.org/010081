Cosmological simulations of reionization often treat radiative transfer by solving for the monopole
and dipoles of the intensity field and by making ansatz for the quadrupole moments to close the system
of equations. We investigate the accuracy of the most common closure methods, i.e. Eddington tensor
choices. We argue that these algorithms are most likely to err at the end of and after reionization
and study test problems mimicking these situations: large-scale post-reionization ionizing
background fluctuations and radiative transfer in a predominantly ionized medium with discrete
absorbers. We show that OTVET and M1 over-ionize Lyman-limit systems when fixing the background
photoionization rate, leading to 30-40% higher emissivity to balance the increased recombination.
This over-ionization results in a simulation run with these algorithms having a factor of ~2 lower
average metagalactic photoionization rate relative to truth given an ionizing emissivity. Furthermore,
these algorithms are unlikely to reproduce ionizing background fluctuations on scales below the
photon mean path: OTVET tends to overpredict the fluctuations there when the simulation box is smaller
than twice the mean free path and underpredict otherwise, while M1 drastically underpredicts these
fluctuations. As a result, these numerical methods are likely not sufficiently accurate to interpret
the Ly$\alpha$ forest opacity fluctuations observed after reionzation. We show that a high number
of angular directions need to be followed to capture the post-reionization ionizing background
fluctuations accurately with ray-tracing codes. Lastly, we argue that the strong dependence of
the post-reionization ionizing background on the value of the reduced speed of light found in many
simulations signals that the ionizing photon mean free path is several times larger in such simulations
than the observationally measured value.

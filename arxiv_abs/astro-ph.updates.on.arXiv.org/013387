We investigate a new class of habitable planets composed of water-rich interiors with massive oceans
underlying H2-rich atmospheres, referred to here as Hycean worlds. With densities between those
of rocky super-Earths and more extended mini-Neptunes, Hycean planets can be optimal candidates
in the search for exoplanetary habitability and may be abundant in the exoplanet population. We
investigate the bulk properties (masses, radii, and temperatures), potential for habitability,
and observable biosignatures of Hycean planets. We show that Hycean planets can be significantly
larger compared to previous considerations for habitable planets, with radii as large as 2.6 Earth
radii (2.3 Earth radii) for a mass of 10 Earth masses (5 Earth masses). We construct the Hycean habitable
zone (HZ), considering stellar hosts from late M to sun-like stars, and find it to be significantly
wider than the terrestrial-like HZ. While the inner boundary of the Hycean HZ corresponds to equilibrium
temperatures as high as ~500 K for late M dwarfs, the outer boundary is unrestricted to arbitrarily
large orbital separations. Our investigations include tidally locked `Dark Hycean' worlds that
permit habitable conditions only on their permanent nightsides and `Cold Hycean' worlds that see
negligible irradiation. Finally, we investigate the observability of possible biosignatures
in Hycean atmospheres. We find that a number of trace terrestrial biomarkers which may be expected
to be present in Hycean atmospheres would be readily detectable using modest observing time with
the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). We identify a sizable sample of nearby potential Hycean planets
that can be ideal targets for such observations in search of exoplanetary biosignatures.

In a recent study, we developed a method to model the impact of photometric redshift uncertainty
on the two-point correlation function (2PCF). In this method, we can obtain both the intrinsic clustering
strength and the photometric redshift errors simultaneously by fitting the projected 2PCF with
two integration depths along the line-of-sight. Here we apply this method to the DESI Legacy Imaging
Surveys Data Release 8 (LS DR8), the largest galaxy sample currently available. We separate galaxies
into 20 samples in 8 redshift bins from $z=0.1$ to $z=1.0$, and a few $\rm z$-band absolute magnitude
bins, with $M_{\rm z} \le -20$. These galaxies are further separated into red and blue sub-samples
according to their $M^{0.5}_{\rm r}-M^{0.5}_{\rm z}$ colors. We measure the projected 2PCFs for
all these galaxy (sub-)samples, and fit them using our photometric redshift 2PCF model. We find
that the photometric redshift errors are smaller in red sub-samples than the overall population.
On the other hand, there might be some systematic photometric redshift errors in the blue sub-samples,
so that some of the sub-samples show significantly enhanced 2PCF at large scales. Therefore, focusing
only on the red and all (sub-)samples, we find that the biases of galaxies in these (sub-)samples
show clear color, redshift and luminosity dependencies, in that red brighter galaxies at higher
redshift are more biased than their bluer and low redshift counterparts. Apart from the best fit
set of parameters, $\sigma_{z}$ and $b$, from this state-of-the-art photometric redshift survey,
we obtain high precision intrinsic clustering measurements for these 40 red and all galaxy (sub-)samples.
These measurements on large and small scales hold important information regarding the cosmology
and galaxy formation, which will be used in our subsequent probes in this series.

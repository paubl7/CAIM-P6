While the longitudinal field that dominates photospheric network regions has been studied extensively,
small scale transverse fields have recently been found to be ubiquitous in the quiet internetwork
photosphere. Few observations have captured how this field evolves. We aim to statistically characterise
the magnetic properties and observe the temporal evolution of small scale magnetic features. We
present two high spatial/temporal resolution observations that reveal the dynamics of two disk
centre internetwork regions taken by the new GRIS/IFU (GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph Integral
Field Unit) with the highly magnetically sensitive Fe I line pair at 15648.52 {\AA} and 15652.87
{\AA}. With the SIR code, we consider two inversion schemes: scheme 1 (S1), where a magnetic atmosphere
is embedded in a field free medium, and scheme 2 (S2), with two magnetic models and a fixed stray light
component. S1 inversions returned a median magnetic field strength of 200 and 240 G for the two datasets,
respectively. We consider the median transverse (horizontal) component, among pixels with Stokes
Q or U, and the median unsigned longitudinal (vertical) component, among pixels with Stokes V, above
a noise threshold. We determined the former to be 263 G and 267 G, and the latter to be 131 G and 145 G,
for the two datasets, respectively. We present three regions of interest (ROIs), tracking the dynamics
of small scale magnetic features. We apply S1 and S2 inversions to specific profiles, and find S2
produces better approximations when there is evidence of mixed polarities. We find patches of linear
polarization with magnetic flux density between 130 and 150 G, appearing preferentially at granule/intergranular
lane (IGL) boundaries. The weak hG magnetic field appears to be organised in terms of complex loop
structures, with transverse fields often flanked by opposite polarity longitudinal fields.

We present the Cosmology and Astrophysics with MachinE Learning Simulations --CAMELS-- project.
CAMELS is a suite of 4,233 cosmological simulations of $(25~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^3$ volume each: 2,184
state-of-the-art (magneto-)hydrodynamic simulations run with the AREPO and GIZMO codes, employing
the same baryonic subgrid physics as the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA simulations, and 2,049 N-body simulations.
The goal of the CAMELS project is to provide theory predictions for different observables as a function
of cosmology and astrophysics, and it is the largest suite of cosmological (magneto-)hydrodynamic
simulations designed to train machine learning algorithms. CAMELS contains thousands of different
cosmological and astrophysical models by way of varying $\Omega_m$, $\sigma_8$, and four parameters
controlling stellar and AGN feedback, following the evolution of more than 100 billion particles
and fluid elements over a combined volume of $(400~h^{-1}{\rm Mpc})^3$. We describe the simulations
in detail and characterize the large range of conditions represented in terms of the matter power
spectrum, cosmic star formation rate density, galaxy stellar mass function, halo baryon fractions,
and several galaxy scaling relations. We show that the IllustrisTNG and SIMBA suites produce roughly
similar distributions of galaxy properties over the full parameter space but significantly different
halo baryon fractions and baryonic effects on the matter power spectrum. This emphasizes the need
for marginalizing over baryonic effects to extract the maximum amount of information from cosmological
surveys. We illustrate the unique potential of CAMELS using several machine learning applications,
including non-linear interpolation, parameter estimation, symbolic regression, data generation
with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.

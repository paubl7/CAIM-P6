The chemical inventory of planets is determined by the physical and chemical processes that govern
the early phases of star formation. The aim is to investigate N-bearing complex organic molecules
towards two Class 0 protostars (B1-c and S68N) at millimetre wavelengths with ALMA. Next, the results
of the detected N-bearing species are compared with those of O-bearing species for the same and other
sources. ALMA observations in Band 6 ($\sim$ 1 mm) and Band 5 ($\sim$ 2 mm) are studied at $\sim$ 0.5"
resolution, complemented by Band 3 ($\sim$ 3 mm) data in a $\sim$ 2.5" beam. NH2CHO, C2H5CN, HNCO,
HN13CO, DNCO, CH3CN, CH2DCN, and CHD2CN are identified towards the investigated sources. Their
abundances relative to CH3OH and HNCO are similar for the two sources, with column densities that
are typically an order of magnitude lower than those of O-bearing species. The largest variations,
of an order of magnitude, are seen for NH2CHO abundance ratios with respect to HNCO and CH3OH and do
not correlate with the protostellar luminosity. In addition, within uncertainties, the N-bearing
species have similar excitation temperatures to those of O-bearing species ($\sim$ 100 $\sim$
300 K). The similarity of most abundances with respect to HNCO, including those of CH2DCN and CHD2CN,
hints at a shared chemical history, especially the high D/H ratio in cold regions prior to star formation.
However, some of the variations in abundances may reflect the sensitivity of the chemistry to local
conditions such as temperature (e.g. NH2CHO), while others may arise from differences in the emitting
areas of the molecules linked to their different binding energies in the ice. The two sources discussed
here add to the small number of sources with such a detailed chemical analysis on Solar System scales.
Future JWST data will allow a direct comparison between the ice and gas abundances of N-bearing species.

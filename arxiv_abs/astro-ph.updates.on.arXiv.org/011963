Starshade in formation flight with a space telescope is a rapidly maturing technology that would
enable imaging and spectral characterization of small planets orbiting nearby stars in the not-too-distant
future. While performance models of the starshade-assisted exoplanet imaging have been developed
and used to design future missions, their results have not been verified from the analyses of synthetic
images. Following a rich history of using community data challenges to evaluate image-processing
capabilities in astronomy and exoplanet fields, the Starshade Technology Development to TRL5
(S5), a focused technology development activity managed by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program,
is organizing and implementing a starshade exoplanet data challenge. The purpose of the data challenge
is to validate the flow down of requirements from science to key instrument performance parameters
and to quantify the required accuracy of noisy background calibration with synthetic images. This
data challenge distinguishes itself from past efforts in the exoplanet field in that (1) it focuses
on the detection and spectral characterization of small planets in the habitable zones of nearby
stars, and (2) it develops synthetic images that simultaneously include multiple background noise
terms -- some specific to starshade observations -- including residual starlight, solar glint,
exozodiacal light, detector noise, as well as variability resulting from starshade's motion and
telescope jitter. In this paper, we provide an overview of the design and rationale of the data challenge.
Working with data challenge participants, we expect to achieve improved understanding of the noise
budget and background calibration in starshade-assisted exoplanet observations in the context
of both Starshade Rendezvous with Roman and HabEx.

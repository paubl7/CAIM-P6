We remind that the ring down features observed in the LIGO GWs resulted from trembling of photon spheres
(Rp=3M) of newly formed compact objects and not from the trembling of their event horizons (R=2M).
Further, the tentative evidences for late time echoes in GWs might be signatures of horizonless
compact objects rather than vacuum black holes (BHs). Similarly, even for an ideal BH, the radius
of its shadow is R_shad = \sqrt{3}Rp is actually the gravitationally lensed shadow of its photon
sphere. Accordingly any compact object having R \geq R = 3M would generate similar shadow. Thus,
no observation has ever detected any event horizon or any exact BH. Also note that the magnetic field
embedded in the accreting plasma close to the compact object is expected to have a radial pattern
of B \sim 1/r while the stronger BHM dipole magnetic field should fall off as B \sim 1/r3. Accordingly
it has been suggested that one may try to infer the true nature of the so-called astrophysical BHs
by studying the radial pattern of the magnetic field in their vicinity. But here we highlight that
close to the surface of BHMs, the magnetic field pattern differs significantly from the same for
non-relativistic dipoles. In particular, we point out that for ultra-compact BHMs, the polar field
is weaker than the equatorial field by an extremely large factor of \sim z_s/lnz_s, where z_s>>1
is the surface gravitational redshift. We suggest that by studying the of radial variation as well
as significant angular asymmetry of magnetic field structure near the compact object, future observations
might differentiate a theoretical black hole from a astrophysical BH mimicker. This study also
shows that even if some BHMs would be hypothesized to possess magnetic fields even stronger than
that of magnetars, in certain cases, they may effectively behave as atoll type neutron stars possessing
extremely low magnetic fields.

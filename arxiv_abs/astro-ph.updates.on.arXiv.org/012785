There are hints suggesting that properties of galaxy populations in dark matter haloes may depend
on their large-scale environment. Recent works point out that very low-density environments influence
halo occupation distribution (HOD), however there is not a similar analysis focused on high-density
environments. Here we use a simulated set of future virialized superstructures (FVS) to analyse
the occupation of galaxies in haloes within these high globally dense regions. We use a publicly
available simulated galaxy set constructed with a semi-analytical model to identify FVS in the
simulation. Then, we computed the HOD within these superstructures for different absolute magnitude
thresholds and make several analysis including the comparison to the global HOD results. We study
the dependence on the results on properties of the FVS such as density and volume as well as consider
the morphology of galaxies. We also analysed the properties of the stellar content of galaxies and
the formation time of the haloes inside FVS. We find a significant increase in the HOD inside FVS.
This result is present for all absolute magnitude thresholds explored. The effect is larger in the
densest regions of FVS, but does not depend on the volume of the superstructure. We also find that
the stellar-mass content of galaxies considerably differs inside the superstructures. Low mass
haloes have their central and satellite galaxies with a higher stellar mass content (50%), and exhibit
mean star ages (20%) older than average. For massive haloes in FVS we find that only the stellar mass
of satellite galaxies varies considerably corresponding to a decrease of 50%. We find a significant
statistical difference between the formation times of haloes in FVS and the average population.
Haloes residing in superstructures formed earlier, a fact that leads to several changes in the HOD
and their member galaxy properties.

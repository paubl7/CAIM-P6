Aims. We present a solution to determine the actual or physical relative positions between CCD chips,
rather than determine their relative positions directly from the distortion-free coordinate.
We verify the applicability of this solution from two types of astrometry. One is to make use of the
astrometric catalog -- Gaia DR2 (Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018) to compute stars' celestial positions.
We refer to the practice as photographic astrometry in this paper. And the other practice is to compute
stars' relative positions by only using their pixel coordinates. We refer to it as differential
astrometry. Meanwhile, we also aim to test the consistency between two types of astrometry from
the results. Methods. By taking advantage of the GD solutions derived from observations, we relate
the physical positions of the adjacent pixel edges of two CCD chips to each other and estimate the
actual relative positions between chips. We implement the technique for two epochs of observations,
which are taken from the CCD mosaic chips of the Bok 2.3-m telescope at Kitt Peak. Results. There is
a good agreement between the two types of astrometry for the relative positions between chips. And
the results provide us with more confidence in the differential astrometry of the planned Chinese
Space Station Telescope (CSST). We achieved a 0.04 pixel uncertainty for the relative positions
between chips on average, at least the factor of two improvement over the method which is used to monitor
the progress of the interchip offset of CCD mosaic chips in the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). For
the first-epoch observations, although suffered from possible variations in the non-linear parts
of distortion, we still achieved a better uncertainty, 0.02 pixel on average.

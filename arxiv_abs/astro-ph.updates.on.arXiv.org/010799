[abridged] Recent laboratory experiments indicate that destructive collisions of icy dust particles
occur with much lower velocities than previously thought. When considering these new velocities
from laboratory experiments in dust evolution models, growing to pebble sizes in protoplanetary
disks (PPDs) is difficult, which may contradict (sub-) millimeter observations and challenge
the formation of planetesimals and planets. We investigate what conditions are required in dust
evolution models to grow and trap pebbles in PPDs when the fragmentation speed is 1 ms$^{-1}$. We
disentangle the parameters controlling the effects of turbulent velocities, vertical stirring,
radial diffusion, and gas viscous evolution, always assuming that particles cannot diffuse faster
(radially or vertically) than the gas. To form pebbles and have effective particle trapping, the
parameter that controls the particle turbulent velocities must be low ($\lesssim10^{-4}$). In
these cases, the vertical settling can limit the formation of pebbles, which also prevents particle
trapping. Therefore, the parameter that sets the vertical settling and stirring of the grains must
be $<10^{-3}$. Our results suggest that different combinations of the particle and gas diffusion
parameters can lead to a large diversity of millimeter fluxes and dust disk radii. When pebble formation
happens and trapping is efficient, gaps and rings have higher contrast at millimeter emission than
at near-infrared. In the case of inefficient trapping, structures are also formed at the two wavelengths,
producing deeper and wider gaps in the near-infrared. Our results highlight the importance to obtain
observational constrains of gas and particle diffusion parameters and the properties of gaps at
short and long wavelengths to better understand basic features of PPDs and the origin of the seen
structures in these objects.

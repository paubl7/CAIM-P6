The density profile of the ambient medium around a supermassive black hole plays an important role
in understanding the inflow-outflow mechanisms in the Galactic Centre. We constrain the spherical
density profile using the stellar bow shock of the star S2 which orbits the supermassive black hole
at the Galactic Centre with the pericentre distance of 14.4 mas ($\sim$ 1500 R$_\text{s}$). Assuming
an elliptical orbit, we apply celestial mechanics and the theory of bow shocks that are at ram pressure
equilibrium. We analyse the measured infrared flux density and magnitudes of S2 in the L'-band (3.8
micron) obtained over seven epochs in the years between 2004-2018. We detect no significant change
in S2 flux density until the recent periapse in May 2018. The intrinsic flux variability of S2 is at
the level of 2 - 3%. Based on the dust-extinction model, the upper limit on the number density at the
S2 periapse is $\sim$1.87$\times$10$^9$ cm$^{-3}$, which yields a density slope of at most 3.20.
Using the synchrotron bow-shock emission, we obtain an ambient density of $\leq$ 1.01$\times$10$^5$
cm$^{-3}$ and a slope of $\leq$ 1.47. These values are consistent with a wide variety of media from
hot accretion flows to potentially colder and denser media comparable in properties to broad-line
region clouds. A standard thin disc can be, however, excluded at the distance of the S2 pericentre.
Based on our sensitivity of 0.01 mag, we can distinguish between hot accretion flows and thin, cold
discs, where the latter can be excluded at the scale of the S2 periapse. Future observations of stars
with smaller pericentre distances in the S cluster using instruments such as METIS@ELT with a photometric
sensitivity of as much as 10$^{-3}$ mag will allow to probe the Galactic Centre medium at intermediate
scales at densities as low as $\sim$ 700 cm$^{-3}$ in case of non-thermal bow-shock emission.

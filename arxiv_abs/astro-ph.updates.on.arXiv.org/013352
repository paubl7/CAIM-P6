The nuclear symmetry energy plays an important role in the description of the properties of finite
nuclei as well as neutron stars. Especially, for low values of baryon density, the accurate description
of the crust-core interface strongly depends on the symmetry energy. Usually, the well known parabolic
approximation is employed for the definition of the symmetry energy without avoiding some drawbacks.
In the present paper, a class of nuclear models, suitable for the description of the inner and outer
core of neutron stars, is applied in studying the effect of higher orders of the expansion of the energy
on the location of the crust-core transition. The thermodynamical and dynamical methods are used
for the determination of the transition density $n_{\rm t}$ and pressure $P_{\rm t}$. The corresponding
energy density functional is applied for the study of some relevant properties of both nonrotating
and slowly rotating neutron stars. We found that the larger the value of the slope parameter $L$,
the slower the convergence of the expansion. In addition, a universal relation is presented between
$n_{\rm t}$ and $L$, by employing the full expression and dynamical approach. The crustal moment
of inertia is very sensitive to the location of the transition while the effects are moderated concerning
the critical angular velocity of the $r$-mode instability and minimum mass configuration. The
effect on the tidal deformability is less but not negligible. In any case, the use of the parabolic
approximation leads to the overestimation of $n_{\rm t}$ and $P_{\rm t}$ and consequently, on inaccurate
predictions. Moreover, in some cases, even the matching process at the interface may affect considerably
the predictions, introducing errors of the same order with the one due to the employed method.

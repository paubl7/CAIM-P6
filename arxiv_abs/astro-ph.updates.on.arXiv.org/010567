Irradiated brown dwarfs (BDs) provide natural laboratories to test our understanding of substellar
and irradiated atmospheres. A handful of short-period BDs around white dwarfs (WDs) have been observed,
but the uniquely intense UV-dominated irradiation presents a modeling challenge. Here, we present
the first fully self-consistent 1D atmosphere models that take into account the UV irradiation's
effect on the object's temperature structure. We explore two BD-WD systems, namely WD-0137-349
and EPIC-212235321. WD-0137-349B has an equilibrium temperature that would place it in the transition
between hot and ultra-hot Jupiters, while EPIC-212235321B has an equilibrium temperature higher
than all ultra-hot Jupiters except KELT-9b. We explore some peculiar aspects of irradiated BD atmospheres
and show that existing photometry can be well-fit with our models. Additionally, the detections
of atomic emission lines from these BDs can be explained by a strong irradiation-induced temperature
inversion, similar to inversions recently explored in ultra-hot Jupiters. Our models of WD-0137-349B
can reproduce the observed equivalent width of many but not all of these atomic lines. We use the observed
photometry of these objects to retrieve the temperature structure using the PHOENIX ExoplaneT
Retrieval Algorithm (PETRA) and demonstrate that the structures are consistent with our models,
albeit somewhat cooler at low pressures. We then discuss the similarities and differences between
this class of irradiated brown dwarf and the lower-mass ultra-hot Jupiters. Lastly, we describe
the behavior of irradiated BDs in color-magnitude space to show the difficulty in classifying irradiated
BDs using otherwise well-tested methods for isolated objects.

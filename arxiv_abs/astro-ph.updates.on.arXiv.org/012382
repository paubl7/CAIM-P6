We seek to find the precursors of the Herbig Ae/Be stars in the solar vicinity within 500 pc from the
Sun. We do this by creating an optically selected sample of intermediate mass T-Tauri stars (IMTT
stars) here defined as stars of masses $1.5 M_{\odot}\leq M_* \leq 5 M_{\odot}$ and spectral type
between F and K3, from literature. We use literature optical photometry (0.4-1.25$\mu$m) and distances
determined from \textit{Gaia} DR2 parallax measurements together with Kurucz stellar model spectra
to place the stars in a HR-diagram. With Siess evolutionary tracks we identify intermediate mass
T-Tauri stars from literature and derive masses and ages. We use Spitzer spectra to classify the
disks around the stars into Meeus Group I and Group II disks based on their [F$_{30}$/F$_{13.5}$]
spectral index. We also examine the 10$\mu$m silicate dust grain emission and identify emission
from Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH). From this we build a qualitative picture of the disks
around the intermediate mass T-Tauri stars and compare this with available spatially resolved
images at infrared and at sub-millimeter wavelengths to confirm our classification. We find 49
intermediate mass T-Tauri stars with infrared excess. The identified disks are similar to the older
Herbig Ae/Be stars in disk geometries and silicate dust grain population. Spatially resolved images
at infra-red and sub-mm wavelengths suggest gaps and spirals are also present around the younger
precursors to the Herbig Ae/Be stars. Comparing the timescale of stellar evolution towards the
main sequence and current models of protoplanetary disk evolution the similarity between Herbig
Ae/Be stars and the intermediate mass T-Tauri stars points towards an evolution of Group I and Group
II disks that are disconnected, and that they represent two different evolutionary paths.

The infrared-radio correlation (IRRC) underpins many commonly used radio luminosity-star formation
rate (SFR) calibrations. In preparation for the new generation of radio surveys we revisit the IRRC
of low-$z$ galaxies by (a) drawing on the best currently available IR and 1.4 GHz radio photometry,
plus ancillary data over the widest possible area, and (b) carefully assessing potential systematics.
We compile a catalogue of $\sim$9,500 z $<$ 0.2 galaxies and derive their 1.4 GHz radio ($L_{\mathrm{1.4}}$),
total IR, and monochromatic IR luminosities in up to seven bands, allowing us to parameterize the
wavelength-dependence of monochromatic IRRCs from 22-500 $\mu$m. For the first time for low-$z$
samples, we quantify how poorly matched IR and radio survey depths bias measured median IR/radio
ratios, $\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$, and discuss the level of biasing expected for low-z IRRC
studies in ASKAP/MeerKAT fields. For our subset of $\sim$2,000 high-confidence star-forming
galaxies we find a median $\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ of 2.54 (scatter: 0.17 dex). We show that
$\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ correlates with $L_{\mathrm{1.4}}$, implying a non-linear
IRRC with slope 1.11$\pm$0.01. Our new $L_{\mathrm{1.4}}$-SFR calibration, which incorporates
this non-linearity, reproduces SFRs from panchromatic SED fits substantially better than previous
IRRC-based recipes. Finally, we match the evolutionary slope of recently measured $\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$-redshift
trends without having to invoke redshift evolution of the IRRC. In this framework, the redshift
evolution of $\overline{q}_{\mathrm{TIR}}$ reported at GHz frequencies in the literature is
the consequence of a partial, redshift-dependent sampling of a non-linear IRRC obeyed by low-$z$
{\it and} distant galaxies.

The role of bipolar jets in the formation of stars, and in particular how they are launched, is still
not well understood. We probe the protostellar jet launching mechanism, via high resolution observations
of the near-IR [FeII] 1.53,1.64 micron lines. We consider the bipolar jet from the Classical T Tauri
star, DO Tau, & investigate jet morphology & kinematics close to the star, using AO-assisted IFU
observations from GEMINI/NIFS. The brighter, blue-shifted jet is collimated quickly after launch.
This early collimation requires the presence of magnetic fields. We confirm velocity asymmetries
between the two jet lobes, & confirm no time variability in the asymmetry over a 20 year interval.
This sustained asymmetry is in accordance with recent simulations of magnetised disk-winds. We
examine the data for jet rotation. We report an upper limit on differences in radial velocity of 6.3
& 8.7 km/s for the blue & red-shifted jets, respectively. Interpreting this as an upper limit on jet
rotation implies that any steady, axisymmetric magneto-centrifugal model of jet launching is
constrained to a launch radius in the disk-plane of 0.5 & 0.3 au for the blue & red-shifted jets, respectively.
This supports an X-wind or narrow disk-wind model. This pertains only to the observed high velocity
[FeII] emission, & does not rule out a wider flow launched from a wider radius. We report detection
of small amplitude jet axis wiggling in both lobes. We rule out orbital motion of the jet source as
the cause. Precession can better account for the observations but requires double the precession
angle, & a different phase for the counter-jet. Such non-solid body precession could arise from
an inclined massive Jupiter companion, or a warping instability induced by launching a magnetic
disk-wind. Overall, our observations are consistent with an origin of the DO Tau jets from the inner
regions of the disk.

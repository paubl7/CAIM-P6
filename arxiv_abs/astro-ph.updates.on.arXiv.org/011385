Solar coronal loops are commonly subject to oscillations. Observations of coronal oscillations
are used to infer physical properties of the coronal plasma using coronal seismology. Excitation
and evolution of oscillations in coronal loops is typically studied using highly idealised models
of magnetic flux-tubes. In order to improve our understanding of coronal oscillations, it is necessary
to consider the effect of realistic magnetic field topology and evolution. We study excitation
and evolution of coronal oscillations in three-dimensional self-consistent simulations of solar
atmosphere spanning from convection zone to solar corona using radiation-MHD code Bifrost. We
use forward-modelled EUV emission and three-dimensional tracing of magnetic field to analyse
oscillatory behaviour of individual magnetic loops. We further analyse the evolution of individual
plasma velocity components along the loops using wavelet power spectra to capture changes in the
oscillation periods. Various types of oscillations commonly observed in the corona are present
in the simulation. We detect standing oscillations in both transverse and longitudinal velocity
components, including higher order oscillation harmonics. We also show that self-consistent
simulations reproduce existence of two distinct regimes of transverse coronal oscillations:
rapidly decaying oscillations triggered by impulsive events and sustained small-scale oscillations
showing no observable damping. No harmonic drivers are detected at the footpoints of oscillating
loops. We show that coronal loop oscillations are abundant in self-consistent 3D MHD simulations
of the solar atmosphere. The dynamic evolution and variability of individual magnetic loops suggest
we need to reevaluate our models of monolithic and static coronal loops with constant lengths in
favour of more realistic models.

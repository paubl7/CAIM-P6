We present results from a study of fifteen red giant members of the intermediate-metallicity globular
cluster (GC) FSR 1758 using high-resolution near-infrared spectra collected with the Apache Point
Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment II survey (APOGEE-2), obtained as part of CAPOS (the
bulge Cluster APOgee Survey). Since its very recent discovery as a massive GC in the bulge region,
evoking the name Sequoia, this has been an intriguing object with a highly debated origin, and initially
led to the suggestion of a purported progenitor dwarf galaxy of the same name. In this work, we use
new spectroscopic and astrometric data to provide additional clues to the nature of FSR 1758. Our
study confirms the GC nature of FSR 1758, and as such we report for the first time the existence of the
characteristic N-C anti-correlation and Al-N correlation, revealing the existence of the multiple-population
phenomenon, similar to that observed in virtually all GCs. Furthermore, the presence of a population
with strongly enriched aluminium makes it unlikely FSR 1758 is the remnant nucleus of a dwarf galaxy,
as Al-enhanced stars are uncommon in dwarf galaxies. We find that FSR 1758 is slightly more metal
rich than previously reported in the literature, with a mean metallicity [Fe/H] between $-1.43$
to $-1.36$ (depending on the adopted atmospheric parameters), and with a scatter within observational
error, again pointing to its GC nature. Overall, the $\alpha$-enrichment ($\gtrsim+0.3$ dex),
Fe-peak (Fe, Ni), light- (C, N), and odd-Z (Al) elements follow the trend of intermediate-metallicity
GCs. ... A new examination of its dynamical properties with the \texttt{GravPot16} model favors
an association with the Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage accretion event. Thus, paradoxically, the cluster
that gave rise to the name of the Sequoia dwarf galaxy does not appear to belong to this specific merging
event.

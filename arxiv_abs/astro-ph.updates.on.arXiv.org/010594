One of the biggest mysteries in the modern cosmology and galaxy formation is the hideout of the "missing
baryons". The leading theory of galaxy formation predicts that a huge amount of baryons resides
around galaxies extending out to their virial radii in the form of diffuse and hot gas of $10^6-10^7\,$K,
which is also known as the major component of the circumgalactic medium (CGM). Studies by various
groups via different techniques, however, have not reached a consensus on the role of CGM in accounting
for the missing baryons, with the estimated contribution ranging from a minor fraction to enclosing
the baryon budget of the galaxy. In this work we attempt to measure the mass of missing baryons in CGM
with a novel method based on the gamma-ray observations of the extended halo of the Andromeda Galaxy.
Since cosmic-ray particles that are generated inside the galaxy will eventually escape to the CGM,
they will produce gamma-ray emission via the proton-proton collision with CGM. Different from
some traditional measurements which are sensitive only to gas in certain specific temperature
range, the hadronic gamma-ray flux is sensitive to baryonic gases in all phases and does not rely
on the metallicity in the halo. Our result suggests that the total baryon mass contained within the
virial radius is less than $(1.4-5)\times 10^{10}M_\odot$ according to the gamma-ray observation.
It implies that the CGM of Andromeda Galaxy may not account for more than $30\%$ of the missing baryons,
but the result is subject to uncertainties from the diffusion coefficient of the CRs in the halo as
well as the stellar mass and dark matter halo mass of the galaxy. This method will become more constraining
provided better understandings on these issues and more sensitive gamma-ray telescopes in the
future.

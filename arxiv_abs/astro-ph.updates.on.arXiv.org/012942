We compare mid-IR and ALMA far-IR images of 12 nearby Seyferts selected from GATOS. The mid-IR unresolved
emission contributes more than 60% of the nuclear emission in most galaxies. By contrast, the ALMA
870micron continuum emission is mostly resolved and typically along the torus equatorial direction
(Paper I, Garcia-Burillo et al. 2021). The Eddington ratios and nuclear hydrogen column densities
NH of half the sample are favorable to launching polar and/or equatorial dusty winds, according
to simulations. Six show mid-IR extended emission in the polar direction as traced by the NLR and
perpendicular to the ALMA emission. In a few, the nuclear NH might be too high to uplift large quantities
of dusty material along the polar direction. Five galaxies have low NH and/or Eddington ratios and
thus polar dusty winds are not likely. We generate new CAT3D-WIND disk-wind model images. At low
wind-to-disk cloud ratios the far-IR model images have disk- and ring-like morphologies. The X-shape
associated with dusty winds is seen better in the far-IR at intermediate-high inclinations for
the extended-wind configurations. In most models, the mid-IR emission comes from the inner part
of the disk/cone. Extended bi-conical and one-sided polar mid-IR emission is seen in extended-wind
configurations and high wind-to-disk cloud ratios. When convolved to our resolution, the model
images reproduce qualitative aspects of the observed morphologies. Low-intermediate wind-to-disk
ratios are required to account for the large fractions of unresolved mid-IR emission. This work
and Paper I provide observational support for the torus+wind scenario. The wind component is more
relevant at high Eddington ratios and/or AGN luminosities, and polar dust emission is predicted
at NH of up to $10^{24}$cm$^{-2}$. The torus/disk component, on the other hand, prevails at low luminosities
and/or Eddington ratios. (Abridged)

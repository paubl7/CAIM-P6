Despite the success of the standard $\Lambda$CDM model of cosmology, recent data improvements
have made tensions emerge between low- and high-redshift observables, most importantly in determinations
of the Hubble constant $H_0$ and the (rescaled) clustering amplitude $S_8$. The high-redshift
data, from the cosmic microwave background (CMB), crucially relies on recombination physics for
its interpretation. Here we study how small-scale baryon inhomogeneities (i.e., clumping) can
affect recombination and consider whether they can relieve both the $H_0$ and $S_8$ tensions. Such
small-scale clumping, which may be caused by primordial magnetic fields or baryon isocurvature
below kpc scales, enhances the recombination rate even when averaged over larger scales, shifting
recombination to earlier times. We introduce a flexible clumping model, parametrized via three
spatial zones with free densities and volume fractions, and use it to study the impact of clumping
on CMB observables. We find that increasing $H_0$ decreases both $\Omega_m$ and $S_8$, which alleviates
the $S_8$ tension. On the other hand, the shift in $\Omega_m$ is disfavored by the low-$z$ baryon-acoustic-oscillations
measurements. We find that the clumping parameters that can change the CMB sound horizon enough
to explain the $H_0$ tension also alter the damping tail, so they are disfavored by current {\it Planck}
2018 data. We test how the CMB damping-tail information rules out changes to recombination by first
removing $\ell>1000$ multipoles in {\it Planck} data, where we find that clumping could resolve
the $H_0$ tension. Furthermore, we make predictions for future CMB experiments, as their improved
damping-tail precision can better constrain departures from standard recombination. Both the
{\it Simons Observatory} and CMB-S4 will provide decisive evidence for or against clumping as a
resolution to the $H_0$ tension.

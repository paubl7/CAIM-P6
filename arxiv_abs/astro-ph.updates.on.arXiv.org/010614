Within the 'Medicina/Effelsberg H2O maser monitoring program' we have observed the maser emission
of R Crt and RT Vir for more than two decades. To get insight in the distribution and longevity of maser
spots in the circumstellar envelopes, we have collected interferometric data, taken in the same
period, from the literature. We confirm short-time variations of individual maser features on
timescales of months to up to 1.5 years. Also decade-long variations of the general brightness level
independent from individual features were seen in both stars. These are due to brightness variations
occurring independently from each other in selected velocity ranges, and are independent of the
optical lightcurves. Expected drifts in velocity of individual features are usually masked by
blending. However, in RT Vir we found an exceptional case of a feature with a constant velocity over
7.5 years (<0.06 km/s/yr). We attribute the long-term brightness variations to the presence of
regions with higher-than-average density in the stellar wind, which host several clouds which
emit maser radiation on the short time scales. These regions typically need ~20 years to cross the
H2O maser shell, where the right conditions to excite H2O masers are present. The constant velocity
feature (11 km/s) is likely to come from a single maser cloud, which moved through about half of RT
Vir's H2O maser shell without changing velocity. From this we infer that its path was located in the
outer part of the H2O maser shell, where RT Vir's stellar wind apparently has already reached its
terminal outflow velocity. This conclusion is corroborated by the observation that the highest
H2O maser outflow velocity in RT Vir approaches the terminal outflow velocity as given by OH and CO
observations. This is generally not observed in other semi-regular variable stars.

The rarity and deeply embedded nature of stars with masses larger than 8 solar masses has limited
our understanding of their formation. Previous work has shown that complementing spectral energy
distributions with interferometric and imaging data can probe the circumstellar environments
of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs) well. However, complex studies of single objects often
use different approaches in their analysis. Therefore the results of these studies cannot be directly
compared. This work aims to obtain the physical characteristics of a sample of MYSOs at ~0.01" scales,
at 0.1" scales, and as a whole, which enables us to compare the characteristics of the sources. We
apply the same multi-scale method and analysis to a sample of MYSOs. High-resolution interferometric
data, near-diffraction-limited imaging data, and a multi-wavelength spectral energy distribution
are combined. By fitting simulated observables derived from 2.5D radiative transfer models of
disk-outflow-envelope systems to our observations, the properties of the MYSOs are constrained.
We find that the observables of all the MYSOs can be reproduced by models with disk-outflow-envelope
geometries, analogous to the Class I geometry associated with low-mass protostars. The characteristics
of the envelopes and the cavities within them are very similar across our sample. On the other hand,
the disks seem to differ between the objects, in particular with regards to what we interpret as evidence
of complex structures and inner holes. This is comparable to the morphologies observed for low-mass
young stellar objects. A strong correlation is found between the luminosity of the central MYSO
and the size of the transition disk-like inner hole for the MYSOs, implying that photoevaporation
or the presence of binary companions may be the cause.

Brown dwarfs with well-determined ages, luminosities, and masses provide rare but valuable tests
of low-temperature atmospheric and evolutionary models. We present the discovery and dynamical
mass measurement of a substellar companion to HD 47127, an old ($\approx$7-10 Gyr) G5 main sequence
star with a mass similar to the Sun. Radial velocities of the host star with the Harlan J. Smith Telescope
uncovered a low-amplitude acceleration of 1.93 $\pm$ 0.08 m s$^{-1}$ yr$^{-1}$ based on 20 years
of monitoring. We subsequently recovered a faint ($\Delta H$=13.14 $\pm$ 0.15 mag) co-moving companion
at 1.95$''$ (52 AU) with follow-up Keck/NIRC2 adaptive optics imaging. The radial acceleration
of HD 47127 together with its tangential acceleration from Hipparcos and Gaia EDR3 astrometry provide
a direct measurement of the three-dimensional acceleration vector of the host star, enabling a
dynamical mass constraint for HD 47127 B (67.5-177 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ at 95% confidence) despite
the small fractional orbital coverage of the observations. The absolute $H$-band magnitude of
HD 47127 B is fainter than the benchmark T dwarfs HD 19467 B and Gl 229 B but brighter than Gl 758 B and
HD 4113 C, suggesting a late-T spectral type. Altogether the mass limits for HD 47127 B from its dynamical
mass and the substellar boundary imply a range of 67-78 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ assuming it is single,
although a preference for high masses of $\approx$100 $M_\mathrm{Jup}$ from dynamical constraints
hints at the possibility that HD 47127 B could itself be a binary pair of brown dwarfs or that another
massive companion resides closer in. Regardless, HD 47127 B will be an excellent target for more
refined orbital and atmospheric characterization in the future.

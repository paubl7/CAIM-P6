Measurement and astrophysical interpretation of characteristic gamma-ray lines from nucleosynthesis
was one of the prominent science goals of the INTEGRAL mission and in particular its spectrometer
SPI. Emission from 26Al and from 60Fe decay lines originates from accumulated ejecta of nucleosynthesis
sources, and appears diffuse in nature. 26Al and 60Fe are believed to originate mostly from massive
star clusters. Gamma-ray observations open an interesting window to trace the fate and flow of nucleosynthesis
ejecta, after they have left the immediate sources and their birth sites, and on their path to mix
with ambient interstellar gas. The INTEGRAL 26Al emission image confirms earlier findings of clumpiness
and an extent along the entire plane of the Galaxy, supporting its origin from massive-star groups.
INTEGRAL spectroscopy resolved the line and found Doppler broadenings and systematic shifts from
large-scale galactic rotation. But an excess velocity of ~200 km/s suggests that 26Al decays preferentially
within large superbubbles that extend in forward directions between spiral arms. The detection
of 26Al line emission from nearby Orion and the Eridanus superbubble supports this interpretation.
Positrons from beta+ decays of 26Al and other nucleosynthesis ejecta have been found to not explain
the morphology of positron annihilation gamma-rays at 511 keV that have been measured by INTEGRAL.
The 60Fe signal measured by INTEGRAL is diffuse but too weak for an imaging interpretation, an origin
from point-like/concentrated sources is excluded. The 60Fe/26Al ratio is constrained to a range
0.2-0.4. Beyond improving precision of these results, diffuse nucleosynthesis contributions
from novae (through 22Na radioactivity) and from past neutron star mergers in our Galaxy (from r-process
radioactivity) are exciting new prospects for the remaining mission extensions.

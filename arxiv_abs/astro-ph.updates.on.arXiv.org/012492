The relation between nuclear ($\lesssim$ 50 pc) star formation and nuclear galactic activity is
still elusive: theoretical models predict a link between the two, but it is unclear whether active
galactic nuclei (AGNs) should appear at the same time, before or after nuclear star formation activity
is ongoing. We present a study of this relation in a complete, volume-limited sample of nine of the
most luminous ($\log L_{\rm 14-195 keV} > 10^{42.5}$ erg/s) local AGNs (the LLAMA sample), including
a sample of 18 inactive control galaxies (6 star-forming; 12 passive) that are matched by Hubble
type, stellar mass (9.5 $\lesssim$ log M_star/M_sun $\lesssim$ 10.5), inclination and distance.
This allows us to calibrate our methods on the control sample and perform a differential analysis
between the AGN and control samples. We perform stellar population synthesis on VLT/X-SHOOTER
spectra in an aperture corresponding to a physical radius of $\approx$ 150 pc. We find young ($\lesssim$
30 Myr) stellar populations in seven out of nine AGNs and in four out of six star-forming control galaxies.
In the non-star-forming control population, in contrast, only two out of twelve galaxies show such
a population. We further show that these young populations are not indicative of ongoing star-formation,
providing evidence for models that see AGN activity as a consequence of nuclear star formation.
Based on the similar nuclear star-formation histories of AGNs and star-forming control galaxies,
we speculate that the latter may turn into the former for some fraction of their time. Under this assumption,
and making use of the volume-completeness of our sample, we infer that the AGN phase lasts for about
5 % of the nuclear starburst phase.

The existence of Intermediate Mass Black Holes (IMBHs) in the centers of globular clusters is heavily
debated. We analyze proper motions from the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and the second Gaia data
release along with line of sight velocities from the MUSE spectrograph to detect imprints of an IMBH
in the center of the nearby, core collapsed, globular cluster NGC 6397. For this, we use the new MAMPOSSt-PM
Bayesian mass-modeling code, along with updated estimates of the surface density profile of NGC
6397. We consider different priors on velocity anisotropy and on the size of the central mass, and
also separate stars into components of different mean mass to allow for mass segregation. The velocity
ellipsoid is very isotropic throughout the cluster, and we argue that this must have been acquired
early on. The data prefer the existence of a dark component in this cluster center of 0.8 to 2 percent
of the total mass of the cluster. However, we find robust evidence to rule out a central IMBH in NGC
6397, in favor of a diffuse dark inner sub-cluster of unresolved objects with total mass ranging
from 1000 to 2000 solar masses, half of it concentrated in a projected radius of 2.5 to 5 arcsec (1 to
2 percent of the stellar effective radius). These results require the combination of HST and Gaia
data: HST for the inner diagnostics, and Gaia for the outer surface density and velocity anisotropy
profiles. The small effective radius of the diffuse dark component suggests that it is composed
of compact stars (white dwarfs and neutron stars) and stellar-mass black holes, whose inner locations
are caused by mass segregation from dynamical friction given the high masses of their progenitors.
We argue that stellar-mass black holes should dominate the mass of this diffuse dark component.

We explore unsupervised machine learning for galaxy morphology analyses using a combination of
feature extraction and hierarchical clustering (HC) within a novel vector-quantised variational
autoencoder (VQ-VAE). We propose a new methodology that includes: (1) consideration of the clustering
performance simultaneously when learning features from images; (2) allowing for various distance
thresholds within the HC algorithm; (3) using the galaxy orientation to determine the number of
clusters. This setup provides 27 clusters created with this unsupervised learning which we show
are well separated based on galaxy shape and structure (e.g., S\'ersic index, concentration, asymmetry,
Gini coefficient). These resulting clusters also correlate well with physical properties such
as the colour-magnitude diagram, and span the range of scaling-relations such as mass vs. size amongst
the different machine-defined clusters. When we merge these multiple clusters into two large preliminary
clusters to provide a binary classification, an accuracy of $\sim87\%$ is reached using an imbalanced
dataset, matching real galaxy distributions, which includes 22.7\% early-type galaxies and 77.3\%
late-type galaxies. Comparing the given clusters with classic Hubble types (ellipticals, lenticulars,
early spirals, late spirals, and irregulars), we show that there is an intrinsic vagueness in visual
classification systems, in particular galaxies with transitional features such as lenticulars
and early spirals. Based on this, the main result in this work is how well our unsupervised method
matches visual classifications and physical properties, as well as providing an independent classification
that is more physically meaningful than any visually based ones.

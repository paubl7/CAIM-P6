The physical foundations of the dissipation of energy and the associated heating in weakly collisional
plasmas are poorly understood. Here, we compare and contrast several measures that have been used
to characterize energy dissipation and kinetic-scale conversion in plasmas by means of a suite
of kinetic numerical simulations describing both magnetic reconnection and decaying plasma turbulence.
We adopt three different numerical codes that can also include inter-particle collisions: the
fully-kinetic particle-in-cell VPIC, the fully-kinetic continuum Gkeyll, and the Eulerian Hybrid
Vlasov-Maxwell (HVM) code. We differentiate between i) four energy-based parameters, whose definition
is related to energy transfer in a fluid description of a plasma, and ii) four distribution function-based
parameters, requiring knowledge of the particle velocity distribution function. There is overall
agreement between the dissipation measures obtained in the PIC and continuum reconnection simulations,
with slight differences due to the presence/absence of secondary islands in the two simulations.
There are also many qualitative similarities between the signatures in the reconnection simulations
and the self-consistent current sheets that form in turbulence, although the latter exhibits significant
variations compared to the reconnection results. All the parameters confirm that dissipation
occurs close to regions of intense magnetic stresses, thus exhibiting local correlation. The distribution
function-based measures show a broader width compared to energy-based proxies, suggesting that
energy transfer is co-localized at coherent structures, but can affect the particle distribution
function in wider regions. The effect of inter-particle collisions on these parameters is finally
discussed.

The day and nightside temperatures of hot Jupiters are diagnostic of heat transport processes in
their atmospheres. Recent observations have shown that the nightsides of hot Jupiters are a nearly
constant 1100 K for a wide range of equilibrium temperatures (T$_{eq}$), lower than those predicted
by 3D global circulation models. Here we investigate the impact of nightside clouds on the observed
nightside temperatures of hot Jupiters using an aerosol microphysics model. We find that silicates
dominate the cloud composition, forming an optically thick cloud deck on the nightsides of all hot
Jupiters with T$_{eq}$ $\leq$ 2100 K. The observed nightside temperature is thus controlled by
the optical depth profile of the silicate cloud with respect to the temperature-pressure profile.
As nightside temperatures increase with T$_{eq}$, the silicate cloud is pushed upwards, forcing
observations to probe cooler altitudes. The cloud vertical extent remains fairly constant due
to competing impacts of increasing vertical mixing strength with T$_{eq}$ and higher rates of sedimentation
at higher altitudes. These effects, combined with the intrinsically subtle increase of the nightside
temperature with T$_{eq}$ due to decreasing radiative timescale at higher instellation levels
lead to low, constant nightside photospheric temperatures consistent with observations. Our
results suggest a drastic reduction in the day-night temperature contrast when nightside clouds
dissipate, with the nightside emission spectra transitioning from featureless to feature-rich.
We also predict that cloud absorption features in the nightside emission spectra of hot Jupiters
should reach $\geq$100 ppm, potentially observable with the James Webb Space Telescope.

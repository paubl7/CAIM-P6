In this paper we present a large sample of jellyfish galaxies in low redshift clusters (z<0.05),
identified through 120-168 MHz radio continuum from the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS). From
a parent sample of 29 X-ray-detected SDSS galaxy clusters and their spectroscopic members, we visually
identify 95 star-forming, LoTSS jellyfish galaxies with 144 MHz radio tails. Star formation rates
(SFRs) and stellar masses are obtained for all galaxies from SED fits. For each jellyfish galaxy
we determine the tail orientation with respect to the cluster centre and quantify the prominence
of the radio tails with the 144 MHz shape asymmetry. After carefully accounting for redshift-dependent
selection effects, we find that the frequency of jellyfish galaxies is relatively constant from
cluster to cluster. LoTSS jellyfish galaxies are preferentially found at small clustercentric
radius and large velocity offsets within their host clusters and have radio tails that are oriented
away from the cluster centre. These galaxies also show enhanced star formation, relative to both
'normal' cluster galaxies and isolated field galaxies, but generally fall within the scatter of
the L144MHz - SFR relation. The properties of the LoTSS jellyfish galaxies identified in this work
are fully consistent with expectations from ram pressure stripping. This large sample of jellyfish
galaxies will be valuable for further constraining ram pressure stripping and star formation quenching
in nearby galaxy clusters. We show that LOFAR is a powerful instrument for identifying ram pressure
stripped galaxies across extremely wide fields. Moving forward we will push the search for jellyfish
galaxies beyond this initial cluster sample, including a comprehensive survey of the galaxy group
regime.

Double detonations in sub-Chandrasekhar mass carbon-oxygen white dwarfs with helium shell are
a potential explosion mechanism for a Type Ia supernova (SNe Ia). It comprises a shell detonation
and subsequent core detonation. The focus of our study is on the effect of the progenitor metallicity
on the nucleosynthetic yields. For this, we compute and analyse a set of eleven different models
with varying core and shell masses at four different metallicities each. This results in a total
of 44 models at metallicities between 0.01$Z_\odot$ and 3$Z_\odot$. Our models show a strong impact
of the metallicity in the high density regime. The presence of $^{22}$Ne causes a neutron-excess
which shifts the production from $^{56}$Ni to stable isotopes such as $^{54}$Fe and $^{58}$Ni in
the $\alpha$-rich freeze-out regime. The isotopes of the metallicity implementation further
serve as seed nuclei for additional reactions in the shell detonation. Most significantly, the
production of $^{55}$Mn increases with metallicity confirming the results of previous work. A
comparison of elemental ratios relative to iron shows a relatively good match to solar values for
some models. Super-solar values are reached for Mn at 3$Z_\odot$ and solar values in some models
at $Z_\odot$. This indicates that the required contribution of SNe Ia originating from Chandrasekhar
mass WDs can be lower than estimated in orevious work to reach solar values of [Mn/Fe] at [Fe/H]$=0$.
Our galactic chemical evolution models suggest that SNe Ia from sub-Chandrasekhar mass white dwarfs,
along with core-collapse supernovae, could account for more than 80% of the solar Mn abundance.
Using metallicity-dependent SN Ia yields helps to reproduce the upward trend of [Mn/Fe] as a function
of metallicity for the solar neighborhood. These chemical evolution predictions, however, depend
on the massive star yields adopted in the calculations.

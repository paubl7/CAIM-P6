The second data release of \it Gaia \rm revealed a parallax zero point offset of $-0.029$~mas based
on quasars. The value depended on the position on the sky, and also likely on magnitude and colour.
The offset and its dependence on other parameters inhibited an improvement in the local distance
scale using e.g. the Cepheid and RR Lyrae period-luminosity relations. Analysis of the recent \it
Gaia \rm Early Data Release 3 (EDR3) reveals a mean parallax zero point offset of $-0.021$~mas based
on quasars. The \it Gaia \rm team addresses the parallax zero point offset in detail and proposes
a recipe to correct for it, based on ecliptic latitude, $G$-band magnitude, and colour information.
This paper is a completely independent investigation into this issue focussing on the spatial dependence
of the correction based on quasars and the magnitude dependence based on wide binaries. The spatial
and magnitude corrections are connected to each other in the overlap region between $17 < G < 19$.
The spatial correction is presented at several spatial resolutions based on the HEALPix formalism.
The colour dependence of the parallax offset is unclear and in any case secondary to the spatial and
magnitude dependence. The spatial and magnitude corrections are applied to two samples of brighter
sources, namely a sample of $\sim$100 stars with independent trigonometric parallax measurements
from \it HST \rm data, and a sample of 75 classical cepheids using photometric parallaxes. The mean
offset between the observed GEDR3 parallax and the independent trigonometric parallax (excluding
outliers) is about $-39$~\muas, and after applying the correction it is consistent with being zero.
For the classical cepheid sample it is suggested that the photometric parallaxes may be underestimated
by about 5\%.

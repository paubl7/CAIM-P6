The spectral window, containing Fraunhofer lines formed in the solar photosphere, around the magnetically
sensitive Cr I lines at 5780.9, 5781.1, 5781.7, 5783.0, and 5783.8 \r{A}, with Land\'e g-factors
between 1.6 and 2.5, is explored. The goal is to analyze simultaneously 15 spectral lines, which
comprise Cr I, Cu I, Fe I, Mn I, and Si I lines, without polarimetry to infer the thermodynamic and magnetic
properties in strongly magnetized plasmas using an inversion code. The study is based on a new setup
at the Vacuum Tower Telescope (VTT, Tenerife) which includes fast spectroscopic scans in the wavelength
range around the Cr I 5781.75 \r{A} line. The snapshot 385 of the Enhanced Network simulation from
the Bifrost code serves to synthesize all the lines, which are in turn inverted simultaneously with
SIR to establish the best inversion strategy. This strategy is then applied to VTT observations
of a sunspot belonging to NOAA 12723 on 2018 September 30 and the results are compared to full-disk
vector-field data obtained with the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI). The 15 simultaneously
inverted intensity profiles (Stokes I) delivered accurate temperatures and Doppler velocities
when compared against the simulations. The derived magnetic fields and inclinations are most accurate
when the fields are oriented along the line-of-sight (LOS) and less accurate when the fields are
transverse to the LOS. In general, the results appear similar to the HMI vector-field data, although
some discrepancies exist. The analyzed spectral range has the potential to deliver thermal, dynamic,
and magnetic information in strongly magnetized features on the Sun, such as pores and sunspots,
even without polarimetry. The highest sensitivity of the lines is found in the lower photosphere,
on average around $\log \tau = -1$. The multiple-line inversions provide smooth results across
the whole field-of-view.

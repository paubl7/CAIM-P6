Accurate cosmological parameter estimates using polarization data of the cosmic microwave background
(CMB) put stringent requirements on map calibration, as highlighted in the recent results from
the Planck satellite. In this paper, we point out that a model-dependent determination of polarization
calibration can be achieved by the joint fit of the TE and EE CMB power spectra. This provides a valuable
cross-check to band-averaged polarization efficiency measurements determined using other approaches.
We demonstrate that, in $\Lambda$CDM, the combination of the TE and EE constrain polarization calibration
with sub-percent uncertainty with Planck data and 2% uncertainty with SPTpol data. We arrive at
similar conclusions when extending $\Lambda$CDM to include the amplitude of lensing $A_{\rm L}$,
the number of relativistic species $N_{\rm eff}$, or the sum of the neutrino masses $\sum m_{\nu}$.
The uncertainties on cosmological parameters are minimally impacted when marginalizing over
polarization calibration, except, as can be expected, for the uncertainty on the amplitude of the
primordial scalar power spectrum $\ln(10^{10} A_{\rm s})$, which increases by $20-50$%. However,
this information can be fully recovered by adding TT data. For current and future ground-based experiments,
SPT-3G and CMB-S4, we forecast the cosmological parameter uncertainties to be minimally degraded
when marginalizing over polarization calibration parameters. In addition, CMB-S4 could constrain
its polarization calibration at the level of $\sim$0.2% by combining TE and EE, and reach $\sim$0.06%
by also including TT. We therefore conclude that relying on calibrating against Planck polarization
maps, whose statistical uncertainty is limited to $\sim$0.5%, would be insufficient for upcoming
experiments.

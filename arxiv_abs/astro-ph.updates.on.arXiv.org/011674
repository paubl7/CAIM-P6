Many galaxies host pronounced circumnuclear starbursts, fuelled by infalling gas. Such activity
is expected to drive the secular evolution of the nucleus and generate super winds, while the intense
radiation fields and extreme gas and cosmic ray densities present may act to modify the outcome of
star formation with respect to more quiescent galactic regions. The centre of the Milky Way is the
only example of this phenomenon where, by virtue of its proximity, individual stars may be resolved.
Previous studies have revealed that it hosts a rich population of massive stars; these are located
within three clusters, with an additional contingent dispersed throughout the Central Molecular
Zone (CMZ). We employed VLT+KMOS to obtain homogeneous, high S/N spectroscopy of the later cohort
for classification and quantitative analysis. Including previously identified examples, we
found a total of 83 isolated massive stars within the Galactic Centre, which are biased towards objects
supporting powerful stellar winds and/or extensive circumstellar envelopes. No further stellar
clusters, or their tidally stripped remnants, were identified, although an apparent stellar overdensity
was found to be coincident with the Sgr B1 star forming region. The cohort of isolated massive stars
within the CMZ is comparable in size to that of the known clusters but, due to observational biases,
is likely highly incomplete at this time. Combining both populations yields over 320 spectroscopically
classified stars that are expected to undergo core collapse within the next 20Myr. Given that this
is presumably an underestimate of the true number, the population of massive stars associated with
the CMZ appears unprecedented amongst star formation complexes within the Milky Way, and one might
anticipate that they play a substantial role in the energetics and evolution of the nuclear region.

Aims: We present a statistical analysis of different characteristics of ringed spiral galaxies
with the aim of assessing the effects of rings on disk galaxy properties. Methods: We built a catalog
of ringed galaxies from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Data Release 14 (SDSS-DR14). Via visual inspection
of SDSS images, we classified the face-on spiral galaxies brighter than $g < 16.0$ mag into galaxies
with: an inner ring, an outer ring, a nuclear ring, both an inner and an outer ring, and a pseudo-ring.
In addition to rings, we recorded morphological types and the existence of bars, lenses, and galaxy
pair companions with or without interaction. With the goal of providing an appropriate quantification
of the influence of rings on galaxy properties, we also constructed a suitable control sample of
non-ringed galaxies with similar redshift, magnitude, morphology, and local density environment
distributions to those of ringed ones. Results: We found 1868 ringed galaxies, accounting for 22%
of the full sample of spiral galaxies. In addition, within galaxies with ringed structures, 46%
have an inner ring, 10% an outer ring, 20% both an inner and an outer ring, 6% a nuclear ring, and 18%
a partial ring. Moreover, 64% of the ringed galaxies present bars. We also found that ringed galaxies
have both a lower efficiency of star formation activity and older stellar populations (as derived
with the $D_n(4000)$ spectral index) with respect to non-ringed disk objects from the control sample.
Galaxies with ringed structures present an excess of high metallicity values compared to non-ringed
ones, which show a $12 + \rm Log (\rm O /\rm H)$ distribution toward lower values. These findings seem
to indicate that rings are peculiar structures that produce an accelerating galactic evolution,
strongly altering the physical properties of their host galaxies.

We aim to see whether debris belts evolving in between two stars may be impacted by the presence of
the companion and whether this leaves any detectable signature that could be observed with current
or future instruments. We consider a circumprimary parent body (PB) planetesimal belt that is placed
just inside the stability limit between the 2 stars and use the DyCoSS code to follow the coupled dynamical
and collisional evolution of the dust produced by this PB belt. We explore several free parameters
such as the belt's mass or the binary's mass ratio and orbit. We use the GraTeR package to produce 2-D
luminosity maps and system-integrated SEDs. We confirm a preliminary result obtained by earlier
DyCoSS studies, which is that the coupled effect of collisional activity, binary perturbations
and stellar radiation pressure maintains a halo of small grains in the dynamically unstable region
between the 2 stars. In addition, several spatial structures are identified, notably a single spiral
arm stretching all the way from the PB belt to the companion star. We also identify a fainter and more
compact disc around the secondary star, which is non-native and feeds off small grains from the unstable
halo. Both the halo, spiral arm and secondary disc should be detectable on resolved images by instruments
with capacities similar to SPHERE. The system as a whole is depleted in small grains when compared
to a companion-free case. This depletion leaves an imprint on the system's integrated SED, which
appears colder than for the same parent body belt around a single star. This new finding could explain
why the SED-derived location $r_{disc}$ of some unresolved discs-in-binaries places their primary
belt in the dynamically "forbidden" region between the 2 stars: this apparent paradox could indeed
be due to overestimating $r_{disc}$ when using empirical prescriptions valid for a single star
case

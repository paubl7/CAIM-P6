Context. The nitrogen reservoir in planetary systems is a long standing problem. Part of the N-bearing
molecules is probably incorporated into the ice bulk during the cold phases of the stellar evolution,
and may be gradually released into the gas phase when the ice is heated, such as in active comets. The
chemical nature of the N-reservoir should greatly influence how, when and in what form N returns
to the gas phase, or is incorporated into the refractory material forming planetary bodies. Aims.
We present the study the thermal desorption of two ammonium salts: ammonium formate and ammonium
acetate from a gold surface and from a water ice substrate. Methods. Temperature-programmed desorption
experiments and Fourier transform infrared reflection spectroscopy were conducted to investigate
the desorption behavior of ammonium salts. Results. Ammonium salts are semi-volatile species
releasing neutral species as major components upon desorption, that is ammonia and the corresponding
organic acid (HCOOH and CH3COOH), at temperatures higher than the temperature of thermal desorption
of water ice. Their desorption follows a first-order Wigner-Polanyi law. We find the first order
kinetic parameters A = 7.7 $\pm$ 0.6 $\times$ 10$^{15}$ s$^{-1}$ and E$_{bind}$ = 68.9 $\pm$ 0.1
kJ~mol$^{-1}$ for ammonium formate and A = 3.0 $\pm$ 0.4 $\times$ 10$^{20}$ s$^{-1}$ and E$_{bind}$
= 83.0 $\pm$ 0.2 kJ~mol$^{-1}$ for ammonium acetate. The presence of a water ice substrate does not
influence the desorption kinetics. Ammonia molecules locked in salts desorb as neutral molecules
at temperatures much higher than previously expected that are usually attributed to refractory
materials. Conclusions. Ammonia snow-line has a smaller radius than the water snow-line. As a result,
the NH3/H2O ratio content in solar system bodies can be a hint as to where they formed and subsequently
migrated.

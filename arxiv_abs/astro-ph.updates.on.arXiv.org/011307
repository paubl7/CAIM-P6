Before reaching their quiescent terminal white-dwarf cooling branch, some low-mass helium-core
white dwarf stellar models experience a number of nuclear flashes which greatly reduce their hydrogen
envelopes. Just before the occurrence of each flash, stable hydrogen burning may be able to drive
global pulsations that could be relevant to shed some light on the internal structure of these stars
through asteroseismology. We present a pulsational stability analysis applied to low-mass helium-core
stars on their early white-dwarf cooling branches going through CNO flashes in order to study the
possibility that the $\varepsilon$ mechanism is able to excite gravity-mode pulsations. We carried
out a nonadiabatic pulsation analysis for low-mass helium-core white-dwarf models going through
CNO flashes during their early cooling phases. We found that the $\varepsilon$ mechanism due to
stable hydrogen burning can excite low-order ($\ell= 1, 2$) gravity modes with periods between
$\sim 80$ and $500\ $s, for stars with $0.2025 \lesssim M_{\star}/M_{\odot} \lesssim 0.3630$ located
in an extended region of the $\log g - T_{\rm eff}$ diagram with effective temperature and surface
gravity in the ranges $15\,000 \lesssim T_{\rm eff} \lesssim 38\,000\ $K and $5.8 \lesssim \log
g \lesssim 7.1$, respectively. Since the timescales required for these modes to reach amplitudes
large enough to be observable are shorter than their corresponding evolutionary timescales, the
detection of pulsations in these stars is feasible. If a low-mass white dwarf star were found to pulsate
with low-order gravity modes in this region of instability, it would confirm our result that such
pulsations can be driven by the $\varepsilon$ mechanism. In addition, confirming a rapid rate of
period change in these pulsations would support that these stars actually experience CNO flashes,
as predicted by evolutionary calculations.

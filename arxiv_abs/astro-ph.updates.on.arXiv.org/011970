The Vela supernova remnant (SNR) shows several ejecta fragments protruding beyond the forward
shock (shrapnel). Recent studies have revealed high Si abundance in two shrapnel (A and G), located
in opposite directions with respect to the SNR center. This suggests the possible existence of a
Si-rich jet-counterjet structure. We analyzed an XMM-Newton observation of a bright clump, behind
shrapnel G, which lies along the direction connecting A and G. The aim is to study the physical and
chemical properties of this clump to ascertain whether it is part of this putative jet-like structure.
We produced background-corrected and adaptively-smoothed count-rate images and median photon
energy maps, and performed a spatially resolved spectral analysis. We identified two structures
with different physical properties. The first one is remarkably elongated along the direction
connecting A and G. Its X-ray spectrum is much softer than that of the other two shrapnel, to the point
of hindering the determination of the Si abundance, however its physical and chemical properties
are consistent with those of shrapnel A and G. The second structure, running along the southeast-northwest
direction, has a higher temperature and appears like a thin filament. By analyzing the ROSAT data,
we have found that this filament is part of a very large and coherent structure that we identified
in the western rim of the shell. We obtained a thorough description of the tail of Shrapnel G. In addition
we discovered a coherent and very extended feature that we interpret as a signature of an earlier
interaction of the remnant with the stellar wind of its progenitor star. The peculiar Ne/O ratio
we found in the wind residual may be suggestive of a Wolf-Rayet progenitor for Vela SNR, though further
analysis is required to address this point.

We present a Bayesian calibration algorithm for CMB observations as implemented within the global
end-to-end BeyondPlanck (BP) framework, and apply this to the Planck Low Frequency Instrument
(LFI) data. Following the most recent Planck analysis, we decompose the full time-dependent gain
into a sum of three orthogonal components: One absolute calibration term, common to all detectors;
one time-independent term that can vary between detectors; and one time-dependent component that
is allowed to vary between one-hour pointing periods. Each term is then sampled conditionally on
all other parameters in the global signal model through Gibbs sampling. The absolute calibration
is sampled using only the orbital dipole as a reference source, while the two relative gain components
are sampled using the full sky signal, including the orbital and Solar CMB dipoles, CMB fluctuations,
and foreground contributions. We discuss various aspects of the data that influence gain estimation,
including the dipole/polarization quadrupole degeneracy and anomalous jumps in the instrumental
gain. Comparing our solution to previous pipelines, we find good agreement in general, with relative
deviations of -0.84% (-0.67%) for 30 GHz, -0.14% (0.02%) for 44 GHz and -0.69% (-0.08%) for 70 GHz,
compared to Planck 2018 (NPIPE). The deviations we find are within expected error bounds, and we
attribute them to differences in data usage and general approach between the pipelines. In particular,
the BP calibration is performed globally, resulting in better inter-frequency consistency. Additionally,
WMAP observations are used actively in the BP analysis, which breaks degeneracies in the Planck
data set and results in better agreement with WMAP. Although our presentation and algorithm are
currently oriented toward LFI processing, the procedure is fully generalizable to other experiments.

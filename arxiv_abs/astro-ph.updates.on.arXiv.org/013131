Recent detections of gravitational waves from mergers of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs)
in the low and high-end mass gap regimes pose a puzzle to standard stellar and binary evolution theory.
Mass-gap mergers may originate from successive mergers in hierarchical systems such as quadruples.
Here, we consider repeated mergers of NSs and BHs in stellar 2+2 quadruple systems, in which secular
evolution can accelerate the merger of one of the inner binaries. Subsequently, the merger remnant
may interact with the companion binary, yielding a second-generation merger. We model the initial
stellar and binary evolution of the inner binaries as isolated systems. In the case of successful
compact object formation, we subsequently follow the secular dynamical evolution of the quadruple
system. When a merger occurs, we take into account merger recoil, and model subsequent evolution
using direct N-body integration. With different assumptions on the initial properties, we find
that the majority of first-generation mergers are not much affected by secular evolution, with
their observational properties mostly consistent with isolated binaries. A small subset shows
imprints of secular evolution through residual eccentricity in the LIGO band, and retrograde spin-orbit
orientations. Second-generation mergers are ~10^7 times less common than first-generation mergers,
and can be strongly affected by scattering (i.e., three-body interactions) induced by the first-generation
merger. In particular, scattering can account for mergers within the low-end mass gap, although
not the high-end mass gap. Also, in a few cases, scattering could explain highly eccentric LIGO sources
and negative effective spin parameters.

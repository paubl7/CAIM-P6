Finding and elucidating the properties of Lyman-continuum(LyC)-emitting galaxies is an important
step for our understanding of cosmic reionization. Although the z - 0.3-0.4 LyC emitters found recently
show strong optical emission lines, no consistent quantitative photoionization model taking
into account the escape of ionizing photons and inhomogenous interstellar medium (ISM) geometry
of these galaxies has yet been constructed. We hence construct one- and two-zone photoionization
models accounting for the observed LyC escape, which we compare to the observed emission line measurements.
We find that one-zone density-bounded photoionization models cannot reproduce the emission lines
of the LyC leakers because they systematically underpredict the lines of species of low ionization
potential, as [OI] and [SII]. Introducing a two-zone model, with differing ionization parameter
and a variable covering fraction and where one of the zones is density-bounded, we show that the observed
emission line ratios and escape fractions of the LyC emitters are well reproduced. The [OI] excess,
which is observed in some LyC leakers, can be naturally explained in this model, e.g., by emission
from low-ionization and low-filling-factor gas. LyC emitters with a high escape fraction (fesc
> 38%) are deficient both in [OI]6300A and in [SII]6716,6731A. We also confirm that a [SII] deficiency
can be used to select LyC emitter candidates. Finally, we find indications for a possible dichotomy
in terms of escape mechanisms for LyC photons between galaxies with relatively low (fesc < 10%) and
higher escape fractions. We conclude that two-zone photoionization models are sufficient and
required to explain the observed emission line properties of z - 0.3-0.4 LyC emitters. These models
provide a first step towards the use of optical emission lines and their ratios as quantitative diagnostics
of LyC escape from galaxies.

Context. The stars in the Milky Way thin and thick disks can be distinguished by several properties
such as metallicity and kinematics. It is not clear whether the two populations also differ in the
properties of planets orbiting the stars. In order to study this, a careful analysis of both the chemical
composition and mass detection limits is required for a sufficiently large sample. Currently,
this information is still limited only to large radial-velocity (RV) programs. Based on the recently
published archival database of the High Accuracy Radial velocity Planet Searcher (HARPS) spectrograph,
we present a first analysis of low-mass (small) planet occurrence rates in a sample of thin- and thick-disk
stars. Aims. We aim to asses the effects of stellar properties on planet occurrence rates and to obtain
first estimates of planet occurrence rates in the thin and thick disks of the Galaxy. As a baseline
for comparison, we also aim to provide an updated value for the small close-in planet occurrence
rate and compare it with the results of previous RV and transit ($\textit{Kepler}$) works. Methods.
We used archival HARPS RV datasets to calculate detection limits of a sample of stars that were previously
analysed for their elemental abundances. For stars with known planets we first subtracted the Keplerian
orbit. We then used this information to calculate planet occurrence rates according to a simplified
Bayesian model in different regimes of stellar and planet properties. Results. Our results suggest
that metal-poor stars and more massive stars host fewer low-mass close-in planets. We find the occurrence
rates of these planets in the thin and thick disks to be comparable. In the iron-poor regimes, we find
these occurrence rates to be significantly larger at the high-$\alpha$ region (thick-disk stars)
as compared with the low-$\alpha$ region (thin-disk stars). In general, we find the...

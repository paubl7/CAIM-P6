We present a catalog of quasars, their photometric redshifts, and redshift uncertainties derived
from the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS) Data Release 4. We train machine learning (ML) models using optical
ugri and near-infrared ZYJHKs bands, on objects known from SDSS spectroscopy. In 45 million objects
of the KiDS data limited to 9-band detections, we define inference subsets based on a feature space
built from magnitudes, their combinations, and shape classifiers. We show that projections of
a feature space on two dimensions can be successfully used instead of the standard color-color plots,
to support the process of building a catalog. The model testing employs two subsets of objects: randomly
selected and the faintest ones, which allows us to properly fit the bias vs. variance trade-off.
We test three ML models and find that XGBoost is the most robust for classification, while Artificial
Neural Networks (ANN) are the best for combined classification and redshift. The catalog is tested
using number counts and Gaia parallaxes. Based on these tests, we calibrate the purity vs. completeness
trade-off with minimum classification probability for quasar candidates: p(QSO_cand)>0.9 for
the safe inference subset at r<22, and p(QSO_cand)>0.98 for the reliable extrapolation at 22<r<23.5.
These cuts provide 158,000 and 185,000 quasar candidates respectively. Test-data purity equals
97%, completeness is 94%, the latter dropping by 3% in the extrapolation to data fainter by one magnitude
than the training set. Test-data redshift error (mean and scatter) equals 0.009 +/- 0.12 in the safe
subset, and -0.0004 +/- 0.19 in the extrapolation, averaged over redshift range 0.14<z<3.63. Our
success of the extrapolation challenges the way that models are optimized and applied at the faint
data end. The resulting catalog is ready for cosmological and Active Galactic Nucleus (AGN) analysis.

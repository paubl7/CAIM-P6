Context. Determination of the metallicities and ages of M31 clusters is fundamental to the studies
of the formation and evolution of M31 itself. The Large Sky Area Multi-Object Fiber Spectroscopic
Telescope (LAMOST) has carried out a systematic spectroscopic campaign of clusters and candidates
in M31. Aims. We construct a catalogue of 346 M31 clusters observed by LAMOST. By combining the information
of the LAMOST spectra and the multi-band photometry, we develope a new algorithm to estimate the
metallicities and ages of these clusters. Methods. We distinguish young clusters from the old using
Random Forest classifiers based on a empirical training data set selected from the literature.
Ages of young clusters are derived from the spectral energy distribution (SED) fits of their multi-band
photometric measurements. Their metallicities are estimated by fitting their observed spectral
principal components extracted from the LAMOST spectra with those from the young metal-rich single
stellar population (SSP) models. For old clusters, we have built non-parameter Random Forest models
between the spectral principal components/multi-band colours and the parameters of the clusters
based on a training data set constructed from the SSP models. Ages and metallicities of the old clusters
are then estimated by fitting their observed spectral principal components extracted from the
LAMOST spectra and multi-band colours from the photometric measurements with the resultant Random
Forest models. Results. We have derived parameters of 53 young and 293 old clusters in our catalogue.
Our resultant parameters are in good agreement with those from the literatures. Ages of about 30
catalogued clusters and metallicities of about 40 sources are derived for the first time.

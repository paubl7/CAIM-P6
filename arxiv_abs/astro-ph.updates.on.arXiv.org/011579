We detect and characterise extended, diffuse radio emission from galaxy clusters at 168 MHz within
the Epoch of Reionization 0-hour field: a $45^\circ \times 45^\circ$ region of the southern sky
centred on R.~A.${}= 0^\circ$, decl.${}=-27^\circ$. We detect 29 sources of interest; a newly
detected halo in Abell 0141; a newly detected relic in Abell 2751; 4 new halo candidates and a further
4 new relic candidates; and a new phoenix candidate in Abell 2556. Additionally, we find 9 clusters
with unclassifiable, diffuse steep-spectrum emission as well as a candidate double relic system
associated with RXC J2351.0-1934. We present measured source properties such as their integrated
flux densities, spectral indices ($\alpha$, where $S_\nu \propto \nu^\alpha$), and sizes where
possible. We find several of the diffuse sources to have ultra-steep spectra including the halo
in Abell 0141, if confirmed, showing $\alpha \leq -2.1 \pm 0.1$ with the present data making it one
of the steepest-spectrum haloes known. Finally, we compare our sample of haloes with previously
detected haloes and revisit established scaling relations of the radio halo power ($P_{1.4}$)
with the cluster X-ray luminosity ($L_{\mathrm{X}}$) and mass ($M_{500}$). We find that the newly
detected haloes and candidate haloes are consistent with the $P_{1.4}$-$L_{\mathrm{X}}$ and
$P_{1.4}$-$M_{500}$ relations, and see an increase in scatter in the previously found relations
with increasing sample size likely caused by inhomogeneous determination of $P_{1.4}$ across
the full halo sample. We show that the MWA is capable of detecting haloes and relics within most of
the galaxy clusters within the Planck catalogue of Sunyaev-Zel'dovich sources depending on exact
halo or relic properties.

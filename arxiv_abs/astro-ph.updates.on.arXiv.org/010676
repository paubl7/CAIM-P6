In this paper, we present a detailed asteroseismological analysis of six GW Vir stars including
the observations collected by the TESS mission. We processed and analyzed TESS observations of
RX J2117+3412, HS 2324+3944, NGC 6905, NGC 1501, NGC 2371, and K 1-16. We carried out a detailed asteroseismological
analysis of these stars on the basis of PG 1159 evolutionary models that take into account the complete
evolution of the progenitor stars. In total, we extracted 58 periodicities from the TESS light curves
using a standard pre-whitening procedure to derive the potential pulsation frequencies. All the
oscillation frequencies that we found are associated with g-mode pulsations with periods spanning
from $\sim 817$ s to $\sim 2682$ s. We find constant period spacings for all but one star, which allowed
us to infer their stellar masses and constrain the harmonic degree $\ell$ of the modes. We performed
period-to-period fit analyses on five of the six analyzed stars. For four stars, we were able to find
an asteroseismological model with masses in agreement with the stellar-mass values inferred from
the period spacings, and generally compatible with the spectroscopic masses. We estimated the
seismological distance and compared it with the precise astrometric distance measured with GAIA.
Finally, we find that the period spectrum of K 1-16 exhibits dramatic changes in frequency and amplitude.
The high-quality data collected by the TESS space mission, considered simultaneously with ground-based
observations, are able to provide a very valuable input to the asteroseismology of GW Vir stars,
similar to the case of other classes of pulsating white-dwarf stars. The TESS mission, in conjunction
with future space missions and upcoming surveys, will make impressive progress in white-dwarf
asteroseismology.

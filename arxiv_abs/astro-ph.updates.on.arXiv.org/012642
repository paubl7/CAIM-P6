Context. Dynamical and turbulent motions of gas in a protoplanetary disk are crucial for their evolution
and affect planet formation. Recent observations suggest weak turbulence in the disk's outer regions.
However, the physical mechanism of turbulence in these outer regions remains uncertain. The vertical
shear instability (VSI) is a promising mechanism to produce turbulence in disks. Aims. Our aim is
to study the observability of the gas velocity structure produced by the VSI via CO kinematics with
ALMA. Methods. We perform global 3D hydrodynamical simulations of a VSI-unstable disk. We post-process
the simulation results with radiative transfer calculations, and produce synthetic predictions
of CO rotational emission lines. Following, we compute the line of sight velocity map, and its deviations
from a sub-Keplerian equilibrium solution. We explore the detectability of the VSI by identifying
kinematic signatures using realistic simulated observations. Results. Our 3D simulations of
the VSI show the steady state dynamics of the gas in great detail. From the velocity structure we infer
a turbulent stress value of $\alpha_{r\phi}=1.4 \times 10^{-4}$. On large scales, we observe velocity
deviations of 50 m s$^{-1}$ as axisymmetric rings. We find optimal conditions at $i \lesssim 20^{\circ}$
to trace for the kinematic structures of the VSI. We found that current diagnostics to constrain
gas turbulence from non-thermal broadening of the line emission are not applicable to anisotropic
VSI turbulence. Conclusions. The detection of kinematic signatures produced by the VSI is possible
with ALMA. Observations including an extended antenna configuration combined with the highest
spectral resolution available are needed for robust detection. The characterization of the large-scale
velocity perturbations is required to constrain the turbulence level produced by the VSI from gas
observations.

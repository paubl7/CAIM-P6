We present an upgraded version of \textsc{MG-MAMPOSSt}, an extension of the \textsc{MAMPOSSt}
algorithm that performs Bayesian fits of models of mass and velocity anisotropy profiles to the
distribution of tracers in projected phase space, to handle modified gravity models and constrain
their parameters. The new version implements two distinct types of gravity modifications, namely
general chameleon and Vainshtein screening, and is further equipped with a Monte-Carlo-Markov-Chain
module for an efficient parameter space exploration. The program is complemented by the \textsc{ClusterGEN}
code, capable of producing mock galaxy clusters under the assumption of spherical symmetry, dynamical
equilibrium, and Gaussian local velocity distribution functions as in \textsc{MAMPOSSt}. We
demonstrate the potential of the method by analysing a set of synthetic, isolated spherically-symmetric
dark matter haloes, focusing on the statistical degeneracies between model parameters. Assuming
the availability of additional lensing-like information, we forecast the constraints on the modified
gravity parameters for the two models presented, as expected from joint lensing+internal kinematics
analyses, in view of upcoming galaxy cluster surveys. In Vainshtein screening, we forecast the
weak lensing effect through the estimation of the full convergence-shear profile. For chameleon
screening, we constrain the allowed region in the space of the two free parameters of the model, further
focusing on the $f(\mathcal{R})$ subclass to obtain realistic bounds on the background field $|f_{\mathcal{R}0}|$.
Our analysis demonstrates the complementarity of internal kinematics and lensing probes for constraining
modified gravity theories, and how the bounds on Vainshtein-screened theories improve through
the combination of the two probes.

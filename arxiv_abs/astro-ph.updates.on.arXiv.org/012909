We take advantage of the publicly available LEGA-C spectroscopic survey to measure the stellar
population properties of 140 individual massive and passive galaxies at $z\sim0.7$. We develop
and publicly release PyLick, a flexible python code to measure UV to near-IR spectral indices. With
PyLick we study the H/K ratio as a new diagnostic based on the pseudo-Lick CaII H and K indices, and
find that a cut in ${\rm H/K}<1.1$ can be used jointly with other criteria to select (or verify the
purity of) samples of passive galaxies. By combining photometric and spectroscopic criteria,
we select a reliable sample of passively evolving galaxies. We constrain single-burst stellar
ages, metallicities $\mathrm{[Z/H]}$, and $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ with an optimized set of Lick
indices, exploring in detail the robustness of our measurement against different combinations.
Even without imposing cosmological priors, the derived ages follow a clear trend compatible with
the expected cosmological aging of the Universe. We observe no significant redshift evolution
for the metal abundance with respect to the values derived at $z=0$, with median $\mathrm{[Z/H]}=0.08\pm0.18$
and $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}=0.13\pm0.11$. Finally, we find positive correlations between $\log\mathrm{age}$,
$\mathrm{[Z/H]}$, $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ and the stellar velocity dispersion, with slopes
of ($0.48\pm0.14$), ($0.26\pm0.17$), and ($0.23\pm0.11$), respectively; the small scatter
of $<0.2$ dex points to rather homogeneous and short star formation histories. Overall, these results
confirm and extend low-redshift findings of a mass-downsizing evolution. This work further strengthens
the possibility of selecting pure samples of passive galaxies to be exploited reliably as cosmic
chronometers to place independent cosmological constraints.

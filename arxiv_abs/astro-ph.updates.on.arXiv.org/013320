Context. HI filaments are closely related to dusty magnetized structures that are observable in
the far infrared (FIR). Recently it was proposed that the coherence of oriented HI structures in
velocity traces the line of sight magnetic field tangling. Aims. We study the velocity-dependent
coherence between FIR emission at 857 GHz and HI on angular scales of 18 arcmin. Methods. We use HI4PI
HI data and Planck FIR data and apply the Hessian operator to extract filaments. For coherence, we
require that local orientation angles {\theta} in the FIR at 857 GHz along the filaments be correlated
with the HI. Results. We find some correlation for HI column densities at |v_LSR | < 50 km/, but a tight
agreement between FIR and HI orientation angles {\theta} exists only in narrow velocity intervals
of 1 km/s. Accordingly, we assign velocities to FIR filaments. Along the line of sight these HI structures
show a high degree of the local alignment with {\theta}, as well as in velocity space. Interpreting
these aligned structures in analogy to the polarization of dust emission defines an HI polarization.
We observe polarization fractions of up to 80%, with averages of 30%. Orientation angles {\theta}
along the filaments, projected perpendicular to the line of sight, are fluctuating systematically
and allow a characteristic distribution of filament curvatures to be determined. Conclusions.
Local HI and FIR filaments identified by the Hessian analysis are coherent structures with well-defined
radial velocities. HI structures are also organized along the line of sight with a high degree of
coherence. The observed bending of these structures in the plane of the sky is consistent with models
for magnetic field curvatures induced by a Galactic small-scale turbulent dynamo.

Radio pulses from pulsars are affected by plasma dispersion, which results in a frequency-dependent
propagation delay. Variations in the magnitude of this effect lead to an additional source of red
noise in pulsar timing experiments, including pulsar timing arrays that aim to detect nanohertz
gravitational waves. We aim to quantify the time-variable dispersion with much improved precision
and characterise the spectrum of these variations. We use the pulsar timing technique to obtain
highly precise dispersion measure (DM) time series. Our dataset consists of observations of 36
millisecond pulsars, which were observed for up to 7.1 years with the LOFAR telescope at a centre
frequency of ~150 MHz. Seventeen of these sources were observed with a weekly cadence, while the
rest were observed at monthly cadence. We achieve a median DM precision of the order of 10^-5 cm^-3
pc for a significant fraction of our sources. We detect significant variations of the DM in all pulsars
with a median DM uncertainty of less than 2x10^-4 cm^-3 pc. The noise contribution to pulsar timing
experiments at higher frequencies is calculated to be at a level of 0.1-10 us at 1.4 GHz over a timespan
of a few years, which is in many cases larger than the typical timing precision of 1 us or better that
PTAs aim for. We found no evidence for a dependence of DM on radio frequency for any of the sources in
our sample. The DM time series we obtained using LOFAR could in principle be used to correct higher-frequency
data for the variations of the dispersive delay. However, there is currently the practical restriction
that pulsars tend to provide either highly precise times of arrival (ToAs) at 1.4 GHz or a high DM precision
at low frequencies, but not both, due to spectral properties. Combining the higher-frequency ToAs
with those from LOFAR to measure the infinite-frequency ToA and DM would improve the result.

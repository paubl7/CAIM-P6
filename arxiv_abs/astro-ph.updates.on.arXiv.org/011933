We describe a system being developed for measuring the shapes of the mirrors of the Fred Young Submillimeter
Telescope (FYST), now under construction for the CCAT Observatory. "Holographic" antenna-measuring
techniques are an efficient and accurate way of measuring the surfaces of large millimeter-wave
telescopes and they have the advantage of measuring the wave-front errors of the whole system under
operational conditions, e.g. at night on an exposed site. Applying this to FYST, however, presents
significant challenges because of the high accuracy needed, the fact that the telescope consists
of two large off-axis mirrors, and a requirement that measurements can be made without personnel
present. We use a high-frequency (~300GHz) source which is relatively close to the telescope aperture
(<1/100th of the Fresnel distance) to minimize atmospheric effects. The main receiver is in the
receiver cabin and can be moved under remote control to different positions, so that the wave-front
errors in different parts of the focal plane can be measured. A second receiver placed on the yoke
provides a phase reference. The signals are combined in a digital cross-correlation spectrometer.
Scanning the telescope provides a map of the complex beam pattern. The surface errors are found by
inference, i.e. we make models of the reflectors with errors and calculate the patterns expected,
and then iterate to find the best match to the data. To do this we have developed a fast and accurate
method for calculating the patterns using the Kirchhoff-Fresnel formulation. This paper presents
details of the design and outlines the results from simulations of the measurement and inference
process. These indicate that a measurement accuracy of ~3 microns rms is achievable.

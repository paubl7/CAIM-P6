The optical and near-infrared (OIR) polarization of starlight is typically understood to arise
from the dichroic extinction of that light by dust grains whose axes are aligned with respect to a
local magnetic-field. The size distribution of the aligned-grain population can be constrained
by measurements of the wavelength dependence of the polarization. The leading physical model for
producing the alignment is radiative alignment-torques (RAT), which predicts that the most efficiently
aligned grains are those with sizes larger than the wavelengths of light composing the local radiation
field. Therefore, for a given grain-size distribution, the wavelength at which the polarization
reaches a maximum ($\lambda_\mathrm{max}$) should correlate with the characteristic reddening
along the line of sight between the dust grains and the illumination source. A correlation between
$\lambda_\mathrm{max}$ and reddening has been previously established for extinctions up to $A_V\approx4$
mag. We extend the study of this relationship to a larger sample of stars in the Taurus cloud complex,
including extinctions $A_V>10$ mag. We confirm the earlier results for $A_V<4$ mag, but find that
the $\lambda_\mathrm{max}$ vs. $A_V$ relationship bifurcates above $A_V\approx4$ mag, with
part of the sample continuing the previously observed relationship and the remaining part exhibiting
a significantly steeper rise. We propose that the data exhibiting the steep rise represent lines-of-sight
towards high density "clumps," where grain coagulation has taken place. We present RAT-based modeling
supporting these hypotheses. These results indicate that multi-band OIR polarimetry is a powerful
tool for tracing grain growth in molecular clouds, independent of uncertainties in the dust temperature
and emissivity.

Optical observations of the quasar J0015+1842 at z=2.6 have recently revealed the presence of multi-phase
outflowing winds intercepted by the line of sight to the active nucleus. Here, we present 3-mm observations
of this system with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA). Our data reveals molecular
gas, traced via a Gaussian CO(3-2) line, with a remarkably large velocity dispersion (FWHM=1014+/-120
km/s). The integrated line flux indicates a total molecular mass in the range M_H2 ~ (3.4-17)x10^10
Msun, with the spread dominated by the assumed CO-to-H2 conversion factor. Assuming the 3-mm continuum
emission is thermal, we derive a dust mass of Mdust ~ 2x10^9 Msun. J0015+1842 is located in the molecular
gas-rich region in the IR vs CO line luminosity diagram, in-between the main locus of main-sequence
and sub-millimeter galaxies and that of most other AGNs targeted so far for CO measurements. While
the large velocity dispersion of the CO line suggests a post merger system, J0015+1842 is observed
to be a regular, only very moderately dust-reddened (Av~0.3-0.4) type-I quasar from its UV-optical
spectrum, from which we infer a mass of the super-massive black hole be around M_BH~6x10^8 Msun.
We suggest that J0015+1842 is observed at a galaxy evolutionary stage where a massive merger has
brought significant amounts of gas towards an actively accreting super-massive black hole (quasar)
that already cleared the way in the circum-nuclear region towards the observer through powerful
winds, while the host still contains a large amount of dust and molecular gas with high velocity dispersion.
Observations of a sample of similar systems should help determining better the respective importance
of evolution and orientation in the appearance of quasars and their host galaxies and have the potential
to investigate early feedback and star-formation processes in galaxies in their quasar phases.

We present GIGANTES, the most extensive and realistic void catalog suite ever released -- containing
over 1 billion cosmic voids covering a volume larger than the observable Universe, more than 20 TB
of data, and created by running the void finder VIDE on QUIJOTE's halo simulations. The expansive
and detailed GIGANTES suite, spanning thousands of cosmological models, opens up the study of voids,
answering compelling questions: Do voids carry unique cosmological information? How is this information
correlated with galaxy information? Leveraging the large number of voids in the GIGANTES suite,
our Fisher constraints demonstrate voids contain additional information, critically tightening
constraints on cosmological parameters. We use traditional void summary statistics (void size
function, void density profile) and the void auto-correlation function, which independently
yields an error of $0.13\,\mathrm{eV}$ on $\sum\,m_{\nu}$ for a 1 $h^{-3}\mathrm{Gpc}^3$ simulation,
without CMB priors. Combining halos and voids we forecast an error of $0.09\,\mathrm{eV}$ from
the same volume. Extrapolating to next generation multi-Gpc$^3$ surveys such as DESI, Euclid,
SPHEREx, and the Roman Space Telescope, we expect voids should yield an independent determination
of neutrino mass. Crucially, GIGANTES is the first void catalog suite expressly built for intensive
machine learning exploration. We illustrate this by training a neural network to perform likelihood-free
inference on the void size function. Cosmology problems provide an impetus to develop novel deep
learning techniques, leveraging the symmetries embedded throughout the universe from physical
laws, interpreting models, and accurately predicting errors. With GIGANTES, machine learning
gains an impressive dataset, offering unique problems that will stimulate new techniques.

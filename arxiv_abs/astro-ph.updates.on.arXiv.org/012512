Context. In this paper we present ultra deep images of the compact group of galaxies HCG 86 as part
of the VEGAS survey. Aims. Our main goals are to estimate the amount of intragroup light (IGL), to
study the light and color distributions in order to address the main formation process of the IGL
component in groups of galaxies. Methods. We derived the azimuthally averaged surface brightness
profiles in the g,r and i bands with g - r and r - i average colors and color profiles for all group members.
By fitting the light distribution, we have extrapolated the contribution of the stellar halos plus
the diffuse light from the brightest component of each galaxy. The results are compared with theoretical
predictions. Results. The long integration time and wide area covered make our data deeper than
previous literature studies of the IGL in compact groups of galaxies and allow us to produce an extended
(~160 kpc) map of the IGL, down to a surface brightness level of about 30 mag/arcsec^2 in the g band.
The IGL in HCG 86 is mainly in diffuse form and has average colors of g - r ~ 0.8 mag and r - i ~ 0.4 mag. The
fraction of IGL in HCG 86 is ~ 16% of the total luminosity of the group, and this is consistent with estimates
available for other compact groups and loose groups of galaxies of similar virial masses. A weak
trend is present between the amount of IGL and the early-type to late-type galaxy ratio. Conclusions.
By comparing the IGL fraction and colors with those predicted by simulations, the amount of IGL in
HCG 86 would be the result of the disruption of satellites at an epoch of z ~ 0.4. At this redshift, observed
colors are consistent with the scenario where the main contribution to the mass of the IGL comes from
the intermediate-massive galaxies.

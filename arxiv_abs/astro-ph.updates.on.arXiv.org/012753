We present an ensemble X-ray analysis of systematic perturbations in the central hot gas properties
for a sample of 28 nearby strong cool-core systems selected from the HIghest X-ray FLUx Galaxy Cluster
Sample (HIFLUGCS). We analyze their cool-core features observed with the Chandra X-ray Observatory.
All individual systems in our sample exhibit at least a pair of positive and negative excess perturbations
in the X-ray residual image after subtracting the global brightness profile. We extract and analyze
X-ray spectra of the intracluster medium (ICM) in the detected perturbed regions. To investigate
possible origins of the gas perturbations, we characterize thermodynamic properties of the ICM
in the perturbed regions and characterize their correlations between positive and negative excess
regions. The best-fit relations for temperature and entropy show a clear offset from the one-to-one
relation, $T_\mathrm{neg}/T_\mathrm{pos}=1.20^{+0.04}_{-0.03}$ and $K_\mathrm{neg}/K_\mathrm{pos}=1.43\pm
0.07$, whereas the best-fit relation for pressure is found to be remarkably consistent with the
one-to-one relation $P_\mathrm{neg}=P_\mathrm{pos}$, indicating that the ICM in the perturbed
regions is in pressure equilibrium. These observed features in the HIFLUGCS sample are in agreement
with the hypothesis that the gas perturbations in cool cores are generated by gas sloshing. We also
analyze synthetic observations of perturbed cluster cores created from binary merger simulations,
finding that the observed temperature ratio agrees with the simulations, $T_\mathrm{neg}/T_\mathrm{pos}\sim
1.3$. We conclude that gas sloshing induced by infalling substructures plays a major role in producing
the characteristic gas perturbations in cool cores. The ubiquitous presence of gas perturbations
in cool cores may suggest a significant contribution of gas sloshing to suppressing runaway cooling
of the ICM.

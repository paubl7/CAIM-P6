We combine orbital information from N-body simulations with an analytic model for star formation
quenching and SDSS observations of galaxy positions, redshifts, and colours to infer the differential
effect of the group/cluster environment on star formation in satellite galaxies. We repeat a similar
exercise with a similar model for gas stripping and supplement the same input catalogue with HI fluxes
from the ALFALFA survey. The statistical models are motivated by and tested on the Hydrangea cosmological
hydrodynamical simulation suite. Our models recover the typical time when galaxies in the satellite
population are stripped and quenched: stripping in massive ($M_{\rm vir}\sim 10^{14.5}\,{\rm
M}_\odot$) clusters typically occurs at or just before the first pericentric passage, and up to
$\sim 4\,{\rm Gyr}$ later in low mass ($\sim 10^{12.5}\,{\rm M}_\odot$) groups. Quenching occurs
later: Balmer emission lines typically fade $\sim 4\,{\rm Gyr}$ ($6.5\,{\rm Gyr}$) after first
pericentre in clusters (groups), followed a few hundred ${\rm Myr}$ later by reddening in $(g-r)$
colour. These 'delay timescales' are remarkably constant across the entire satellite stellar
mass range probed ($\sim 10^{9.5}$--$10^{11}\,{\rm M}_\odot$); this feature is closely tied
to our treatment of 'group pre-processing'. While our measurements are qualitatively consistent
with the `delayed-then-rapid' quenching scenario advocated for by several other studies, we find
significantly longer delay times. The origin of this apparent discrepancy is difficult to pinpoint.
However, our unique use of a homogeneous analysis and input catalogues yields new insight into the
sequence of events leading to quenching across wide intervals in host and satellite mass.

With the aim of studying the properties of Galactic IR bubbles and their impact in massive star formation,
we present a study of the IR bubble S169, associated with the massive star forming region IRAS12326-6245.
We used CO(2-1),$^{13}$CO(2-1), C$^{18}$O(2-1), HCN(3-2), and HCO+(3-2) line data obtained
with the APEX telescope to study the properties of the molecular gas in the nebula and the IRAS source
. To analyze the properties and distribution of the dust, we used IRAC-GLIMPSE, Herschel, and ATLASGAL
data. The properties of the ionized gas were studied using images obtained from the SUMSS survey
and SuperCOSMOS database. In our search for stellar and protostellar objects in the region, we used
IR and optical point source calalogs. The new APEX observations allowed us to identify three molecular
components associated with the nebula, namely: at $-$39 km/s (component A), $-$25 km/s (component
B), and $-$17 km/s (component C). Six molecular condensations (MC1 to MC6) were identified in component
A, with MC3 (the densest and more massive one) being the molecular counterpart of IRAS12326-6245.
For this source, we estimated an H$_2$ column density up to 8$\times$10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$. To explain
the morphology and velocity of components A, B, and C, we propose a simple model consisting of a partially
complete semisphere-like structure expanding at ~ 12 km/s. The introduction of this model has led
to a discussion about the distance to both S169 and IRAS12326-6245, which was estimated to be ~ 2 kpc.
Several candidate YSOs were identified, projected mostly onto the molecular condensations MC3,
MC4, and MC5, which indicates that the star-formation process is very active at the borders of the
nebula. A comparison between observable and modeled parameters was not enough to discern whether
the collect-and-collapse mechanism is acting at the edge of S169.

Context. Obtaining precise stellar and wind properties and abundance patterns of massive stars
is crucial to understanding their nature and interactions with their environments, as well as to
constrain their evolutionary paths and end-products. Aims. To enable higher versatility and precision
of the complete UV to optical range, we improve our NLTE atmosphere and spectrum synthesis code FASTWIND.
We also aim to obtain an advanced description of X-ray emission from wind-embedded shocks. Methods.
We include a detailed comoving frame radiative transfer for the essential frequency range, but
still apply methods that enable low turnaround times. Results. In most cases, our new results agree
excellently with those from the alternative code CMFGEN, both regarding the total radiative acceleration,
strategic optical lines, and the UV-range. The agreement regarding NIII4634-4640-4642 has improved,
though there are still certain discrepancies, mostly related to line overlap effects in the extreme
ultraviolet. In the UV range of our coolest models, we find differences in the predicted depression
of the pseudo-continuum, most pronounced around Ly_alpha. The comparison between our new and previous
FASTWIND version reveals an almost perfect agreement, except for NV 4603-4619. Using an improved,
depth-dependent description for the filling factors of hot, X-ray emitting material, we confirm
previous analytic scaling relations with our numerical models. Conclusions. We warn against uncritically
relying on transitions, which are strongly affected by direct or indirect line-overlap effects.
The predicted UV-continuum depression for the coolest grid-models needs to be checked, both observationally,
and regarding the underlying atomic data. Wind lines from "super-ionized" ions such as OVI can,
in principle, be used to constrain the distribution of wind-embedded shocks.

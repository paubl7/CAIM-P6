In the currently accepted model for cosmic baryon evolution, Cosmic Dawn and the Epoch of Reionization
are significant times when first light from the first luminous objects emerged, transformed and
subsequently ionized the primordial gas. The 21 cm hyperfine transition of neutral hydrogen, redshifted
from these cosmic times to a frequency range of 40 to 200 MHz, has been recognized as an important probe
of the physics of CD/EoR. The global 21-cm signal is predicted to be a spectral distortion of a few
10's to a few 100's of mK, which is expected to be present in the cosmic radio background as a trace additive
component. SARAS, Shaped Antenna measurement of the background RAdio Spectrum, is a spectral radiometer
purpose designed to detect the weak 21-cm signal from CD/EoR. An important subsystem of the radiometer,
the digital correlation spectrometer, is developed around a high speed digital signal processing
platform called pSPEC. pSPEC is built around two quad 10 bit analog-to-digital converters and a
Virtex 6 field programmable gate array, with provision for multiple Gigabit Ethernet and 4.5 Gbps
fibre optic interfaces. Here we describe the system design of the digital spectrometer, the pSPEC
board, and the adaptation of pSPEC to implement a high spectral resolution of about 61 kHz, high dynamic
range correlation spectrometer covering the entire CD/EoR band. As the SARAS radiometer is required
to be deployed in remote locations where terrestrial radio frequency interference is a minimum,
the spectrometer is designed to be compact, portable and operating off internal batteries. The
paper includes an evaluation of the spectrometer's susceptibility to radio frequency interference
and capability to detect signals from CD/EoR.

Galaxy clusters are an important tool for cosmology, and their detection and characterization
are key goals for current and future surveys. Using data from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer
(WISE), the Massive and Distant Clusters of WISE Survey (MaDCoWS) located 2,839 significant galaxy
overdensities at redshifts $0.7\lesssim z\lesssim 1.5$, which included extensive follow-up
imaging from the Spitzer Space Telescope to determine cluster richnesses. Concurrently, the Atacama
Cosmology Telescope (ACT) has produced large area mm-wave maps in three frequency bands along with
a large catalog of Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) selected clusters, as part of its Data Release 5 (DR5).
Using the maps and cluster catalog from DR5, we explore the scaling between SZ mass and cluster richness.
We use complementary radio survey data from the Very Large Array, submillimeter data from Herschel,
and ACT 224~GHz data to assess the impact of contaminating sources on the SZ signals. We then use a
hierarchical Bayesian model to fit the mass-richness scaling relation. We find that MaDCoWS clusters
have submillimeter contamination which is consistent with a gray-body spectrum, while the ACT
clusters are consistent with no submillimeter emission on average. We find the best fit ACT SZ mass
vs. MaDCoWS richness scaling relation has a slope of $\kappa = 1.84^{+0.15}_{-0.14}$, where the
slope is defined as $M\propto \lambda_{15}^{\kappa}$ where $\lambda_{15}$ is the richness. Additionally,
we find that the approximate level of in-fill of the ACT and MaDCoWS cluster SZ signals to be at the
percent level. We conclude that the original MaDCoWS survey's selection function is not well defined,
and, as such, reiterate the MaDCoWS collaboration's recommendation that the sample is suited for
probing cluster and galaxy evolution, but not cosmological analyses.

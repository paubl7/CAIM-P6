The chemical abundances of exoplanet atmospheres may provide valuable information about the bulk
compositions, formation pathways, and evolutionary histories of planets. Exoplanets with large,
relatively cloud-free atmospheres, and which orbit bright stars provide the best opportunities
for accurate abundance measurements. For this reason, we measured the transmission spectrum of
the bright (V~10.2), large (1.37 R$_{J}$), sub-Saturn mass (0.19 M$_{J}$) exoplanet WASP-127b
across the near-UV to near-infrared wavelength range (0.3 - 5 $\mu$m), using the Hubble and Spitzer
Space Telescopes. Our results show a feature-rich transmission spectrum, with absorption from
Na, H$_{2}$O, and CO$_{2}$, and wavelength-dependent scattering from small-particle condensates.
We ran two types of atmospheric retrieval models: one enforcing chemical equilibrium, and the other
which fit the abundances freely. Our retrieved abundances at chemical equilibrium for Na, O and
C are all super-solar, with abundances relative to solar values of 9$^{+15}_{-6}$, 16$^{+7}_{-5}$,
and 26$^{+12}_{-9}$ respectively. Despite giving conflicting C/O ratios, both retrievals gave
super-solar CO$_{2}$ volume mixing ratios, which adds to the likelihood that WASP-127b's bulk
metallicity is super-solar, since CO$_{2}$ abundance is highly sensitive to atmospheric metallicity.
We detect water at a significance of 13.7 $\sigma$. Our detection of Na is in agreement with previous
ground-based detections, though we find a much lower abundance, and we also do not find evidence
for Li or K despite increased sensitivity. In the future, spectroscopy with JWST will be able to constrain
WASP-127b's C/O ratio, and may reveal the formation history of this metal-enriched, highly observable
exoplanet.

Discovering wide companions of stellar systems allows us to constrain the dynamical environment
and age of the latter. We studied four probable wide companions of four different stellar systems.
The central stars are V4046 Sgr, HIP 74865, HIP 65426, and HIP 73145, and their probable wide companions
are 2MASS J18152222-3249329, 2MASS J15174874-3028484, 2MASS J13242119-5129503, and 2MASS J14571503-3543505
respectively. V4046 Sgr is a member of $\beta$-Pictoris Moving Group while the rest of the stellar
systems are acknowledged as members of the Scorpius-Centaurus association. The selected stellar
systems are particularly interesting because all of them are already known to possess a low-mass
companion and/or a spatially resolved disk. Identifying wider companions of these stars can improve
their eligibility as benchmarks for understanding the formation channels of various triple systems,
and can help us to determine the orbits of their possibly undiscovered inner, wider companions in
case of higher multiplicity. We find that 2MASS J15174874-3028484 (0.11 $M_{\odot}$, 7.4$\pm$0.5
Myr), an already recognized pre-main sequence (PMS) member of Scorpius-Centaurus association,
is a highly probable wide companion of HIP 74865. 2MASS J13242119-5129503 (0.04 $M_{\odot}$, 16$\pm$2.2
Myr) is ruled out as a plausible wide companion of HIP 65426, but confirmed to be a new sub-stellar
member of the Scorpius-Centaurus association. 2MASS J14571503-3543505 (0.02 $M_{\odot}$, 17.75$\pm$4.15
Myr) is a probable sub-stellar member of the same association, but we cannot confirm whether or not
it is gravitationally bound to HIP 73145. 2MASS J18152222-3249329 (0.3 $M_{\odot}$, older than
150 Myr) is determined to be a mildly active main sequence (MS) star, much older than members of $\beta$-Pictoris
Moving Group, and unbound to V4046 Sgr despite their similar kinematic features.

The currently developing space-based gamma-ray telescope GAMMA-400 will measure the gamma-ray
and electrons + positrons fluxes using the main top-down aperture in the energy range from ~20 MeV
to several TeV in the highly elliptic orbit (without shadowing the telescope by the Earth and outside
the radiation belts) continuously for a long time. The instrument will provide fundamentally new
data on discrete gamma-ray sources, gamma-ray bursts (GRBs), sources and propagation of Galactic
cosmic rays and signatures of dark matter due to its unique angular and energy resolutions in the
wide energy range. The gamma-ray telescope consists of the anticoincidence system (AC), the converter-tracker
(C), the time-of-flight system (S1 and S2), the position-sensitive and electromagnetic calorimeters
(CC1 and CC2), the top and bottom scintillation detectors of the calorimeter (S3 and S4) and lateral
detectors of the calorimeter (LD). In this paper, the capabilities of the GAMMA-400 gamma-ray telescope
to measure fluxes of GRBs from lateral directions of CC2 are analyzed using Monte-Carlo simulations.
The analysis is based on second-level trigger construction using signals from S3, CC2, S4 and LD
detectors. For checking the numerical algorithm the data from space-based GBM and LAT instruments
of the Fermi experiment are used, namely, three long bursts: GRB 080916C, GRB 090902B, GRB 090926A
and one short burst GRB 090510A. The obtained results allow us to conclude that from lateral directions
the GAMMA-400 space-based gamma-ray telescope will reliably measure the spectra of bright GRBs
in the energy range from ~10 to ~100 MeV with the effective area of about 0.13 m2 (for each of the four
sides of CC2) and total field of view of about 6 sr.

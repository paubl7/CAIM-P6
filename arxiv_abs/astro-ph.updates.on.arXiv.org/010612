We investigate small-scale light variations in V646 Pup occurring on different timescales with
the aim to investigate whether this variability is similar to that observed in FU Ori. We observed
V646 Pup at the SAAO and CTIO between 2013 and 2018 with Johnson and Sloan filters, typically using
a one-day cadence maintained for 1-4 weeks. We also utilised the public-domain 1512-day-long ASAS-SN
light curve and TESS photometry obtained in 2019 over 24.1 days with a 30 min cadence. New SAAO low-resolution
spectra assist in updating major disc parameters, while the archival high-resolution Keck spectra
are used to search for temporal changes in the disc rotational profiles. The ground-based observations
confirm the constantly decreasing brightness of V646 Pup at the rate of 0.018 mag/yr. Precise TESS
data show that the slight, 0.005-0.01 mag, light variations imposed on this general trend do consist
of a few independent wave trains of an apparently time-coherent nature. Assuming that this is typical
situation, based on an analysis of colour-magnitude diagrams obtained for earlier epochs, we were
able to make a preliminarily inference that the bulk of the light changes observed could be due to
the rotation of disc photosphere inhomogeneities, arising between 10-12 solar radii from the star.
We do not exclude the possibility that these inhomogeneities could also manifest themselves in
the rotational profiles of the disc, as obtained from the high-resolution spectra. Assuming Keplerian
rotation of these inhomogeneities, we give a preliminary determination of the stellar mass at 0.7-0.9
solar mass. These preliminary results are similar to those better established for FU Ori, which
suggests a common driving mechanism(s).

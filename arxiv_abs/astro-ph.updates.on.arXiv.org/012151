Aims. We aim to investigate the I([CII]) versus I([NII]) integrated intensity behavior in the AF
region in order to assess the [CII] emission contribution from the H II region, which is traced by
[NII] line observations, and PDR components in the high-metallicity environment of the GC. Methods.
We used [CII] 158 um and [NII] 205 um fine-structure line observations of the AF in the literature
to compare their observational integrated intensity distribution to semi-theoretical predictions
for the contribution of H II regions and adjacent PDRs to the observed [CII] emission. We explored
variations in the [C/N] elemental abundance ratio to explain the overall behavior of the observed
relationship. Based on our models, the H II region and PDR contributions to the observed [CII] emission
is calculated for a few positions within and near to the AF. Estimates for the [C/N] abundance ratio
and [N/H] nitrogen elemental abundance in the AF can then be derived. Results. The behavior of the
I([CII]) versus I([NII]) relationship in the AF can be explained by model results satisfying 0.84
< [C/N]_AF < 1.41, with model metallicities ranging from 1 Z to 2 Z, hydrogen volume density log n(H)
= 3.5, and ionization parameters log U from -1 to -2. A least-squares fit to the model data points yields
log I([CII]) = 1.068log I([NII]) + 0.645 to predict the [CII] emission arising from the H II regions
in the AF. The fraction of the total observed [CII] emission arising from within PDRs varies between
~ 0.20 and ~ 0.75. Our results yield average values for the carbon-to-nitrogen ratio and nitrogen
elemental abundances of [C/N]_AF = 1.13 +/- 0.09 and [N/H]_AF = 6.21x10^4 for the AF, respectively.
They are a factor of ~ 0.4 smaller and ~ 7.5 larger than their corresponding Galactic disk values.

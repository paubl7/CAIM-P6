The sub-Saturn ($\sim$4--8$R_{\oplus}$) occurrence rate rises with orbital period out to at least
$\sim$300 days. In this work we adopt and test the hypothesis that the decrease in their occurrence
towards the star is a result of atmospheric mass loss, which can transform sub-Saturns into sub-Neptunes
($\lesssim$4$R_{\oplus}$) more efficiently at shorter periods. We show that under the mass loss
hypothesis, the sub-Saturn occurrence rate can be leveraged to infer their underlying core mass
function, and by extension that of gas giants. We determine that lognormal core mass functions peaked
near $\sim$10--20$M_{\oplus}$ are compatible with the sub-Saturn period distribution, the distribution
of observationally-inferred sub-Saturn cores, and gas accretion theories. Our theory predicts
that close-in sub-Saturns should be less common and $\sim$30\% more massive around rapidly rotating
stars; this should be directly testable for stars younger than $\lesssim$1 Gyr. We also predict
that the sub-Jovian desert becomes less pronounced and opens up at smaller orbital periods around
M stars compared to solar-type stars ($\sim$0.7 days vs. $\sim$3 days). We demonstrate that exceptionally
low-density sub-Saturns, "Super-Puffs", can survive intense hydrodynamic escape to the present
day if they are born with even larger atmospheres than they currently harbor; in this picture, Kepler
223 d began with an envelope $\sim$1.5$\times$ the mass of its core and is currently losing its envelope
at a rate $\sim$2$\times 10^{-3}M_{\oplus}~\mathrm{Myr}^{-1}$. If the predictions from our
theory are confirmed by observations, the core mass function we predict can also serve to constrain
core formation theories of gas-rich planets.

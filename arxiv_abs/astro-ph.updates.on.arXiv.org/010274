We present $^{29}$SiO(J=8--7) $\nu$=0, SiS (J=19--18) $\nu$=0, and $^{28}$SiO (J=8--7) $\nu$=1
molecular line archive observations made with the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array
(ALMA) of the molecular outflow associated with Orion Source I. The observations show velocity
asymmetries about the flow axis which are interpreted as outflow rotation. We find that the rotation
velocity ($\sim$4--8 km s$^{-1}$) decreases with the vertical distance to the disk. In contrast,
the cylindrical radius ($\sim$100--300 au), the expansion velocity ($\sim$2--15 km s$^{-1}$),
and the axial velocity $v_{\rm z}$ ($\sim$-1--10 km s$^{-1}$) increase with the vertical distance.
The mass estimated of the molecular outflow $\mathrm{M}_{\rm outflow}\sim$0.66--1.3 M$_\odot$.
Given a kinematic time $\sim$130 yr, this implies a mass loss rate $\dot{\mathrm{M}}_{\rm outflow}
\sim 5.1-10 \times 10^{-3}$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$. This massive outflow sets important contraints
on disk wind models. We compare the observations with a model of a shell produced by the interaction
between an anisotropic stellar wind and an Ulrich accretion flow that corresponds to a rotating
molecular envelope in collapse. We find that the model cylindrical radii are consistent with the
$^{29}$SiO(J=8--7) $\nu$=0 data. The expansion velocities and the axial velocities of the model
are similar the observed values, except close to the disk ($z\sim\pm$150 au) for the expansion velocity.
Nevertheless, the rotation velocities of the model are a factor $\sim$3--10 lower than the observed
values. We conclude that the Ulrich flow alone cannot explain the rotation observed and other possibilities
should be explored, like the inclusion of the angular momentum of a disk wind.

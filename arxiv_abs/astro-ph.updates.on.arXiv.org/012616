The abundance of interstellar ice constituents is usually expressed with respect to the water ice
because, in denser regions, a significant portion of the interstellar grain surface would be covered
by water ice. The binding energy (BE), or adsorption energy of the interstellar species regulates
the chemical complexity of the interstellar grain mantle. Due to the high abundance of water ice,
the BE of surface species with the water is usually provided and widely used in astrochemical modeling.
However, the hydrogen molecules would cover some part of the grain mantle in the denser and colder
part of the interstellar medium. Even at around ~ 10K, few atoms and simple molecules with lower adsorption
energies can migrate through the surface. The BE of the surface species with H2 substrate would be
very different from that of a water substrate. However, adequate information regarding these differences
is lacking. Here, we employ the quantum chemical calculation to provide the BE of 95 interstellar
species with H2 substrate. These are representative of the BEs of species to a H2 overlayer on a grain
surface. On average, we notice that the BE with the H2 monomer substrate is almost ten times lower
than the BE of these species reported earlier with the H2 O c-tetramer configuration. The encounter
desorption of H and H2 was introduced (with ED (H, H2 ) =45 K and ED (H2 , H2 ) =23 K) to have a realistic
estimation of the abundances of the surface species in the colder and denser region. Our quantum
chemical calculations yield higher adsorption energy of H2 than that of H (ED (H, H2 ) = 23 - 25 K and
ED (H2, H2 ) =67 - 79 K). We further implement an astrochemical model to study the effect of encounter
desorption with the resent realistic estimation. The encounter desorption of the N atom (calculations
yield ED (N, H2 ) =83 K) is introduced to study the differences with its inclusion.

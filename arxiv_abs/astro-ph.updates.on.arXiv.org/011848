Recent detections of gravitational waves from mergers of neutron stars (NSs) and black holes (BHs)
in the low and high-end mass gap regimes (with masses between ~2-5 M_Sun and exceeding ~50 M_Sun,
respectively) pose a puzzle to standard stellar and binary evolution theory. Mass-gap mergers
may originate from successive mergers in hierarchical systems such as quadruples. Here, we consider
repeated mergers of NSs and BHs in stellar 2+2 quadruple systems. Under certain circumstances,
secular evolution acts to accelerate the merger of one of the inner binaries. Subsequently, the
merger remnant may interact with the companion binary, yielding a second-generation merger event.
We model the initial stellar and binary evolution of the inner binaries as isolated systems. In the
case of successful compact object formation, we subsequently follow the secular dynamical evolution
of the quadruple system. When a merger occurs, we take into account merger recoil, and model subsequent
evolution using direct N-body methods. With different assumptions on the initial binary properties,
we find that the majority of first-generation mergers are not much affected by secular evolution,
with their observational properties mostly consistent with isolated binaries. A small subset
shows imprints of secular evolution through residual eccentricity in the LIGO band, and retrograde
spin-orbit orientations. Second-generation mergers can be strongly affected by scattering (i.e.,
three-body interactions) induced by the first-generation merger. In particular, scattering
can account for mergers within the low-end mass gap, although not the high-end mass gap. Also, scattering
could explain highly eccentric LIGO sources and negative effective spin parameters.

We present LMT/AzTEC 1.1mm observations of $\sim100$ luminous high-redshift dusty star-forming
galaxy candidates from the $\sim600\,$sq.deg $Herschel$-ATLAS survey, selected on the basis
of their SPIRE red far-infrared colours and with $S_{500\mu\rm m}=35-80$ mJy. With an effective
$\theta_{\rm FWHM}\approx9.5\,$ arcsec angular resolution, our observations reveal that at
least 9 per cent of the targets break into multiple systems with SNR $\geq 4$ members. The fraction
of multiple systems increases to $\sim23\,$ per cent (or more) if some non-detected targets are
considered multiples, as suggested by the data. Combining the new AzTEC and deblended $Herschel$
photometry we derive photometric redshifts, IR luminosities, and star formation rates. While
the median redshifts of the multiple and single systems are similar $(z_{\rm med}\approx3.6)$,
the redshift distribution of the latter is skewed towards higher redshifts. Of the AzTEC sources
$\sim85\,$ per cent lie at $z_{\rm phot}>3$ while $\sim33\,$ per cent are at $z_{\rm phot}>4$. This
corresponds to a lower limit on the space density of ultra-red sources at $4<z<6$ of $\sim3\times10^{-7}\,
\textrm{Mpc}^{-3}$ with a contribution to the obscured star-formation of $\gtrsim 8\times10^{-4}\,
\textrm{M}_\odot \textrm{yr}^{-1} \textrm{Mpc}^{-3}$. Some of the multiple systems have members
with photometric redshifts consistent among them suggesting possible physical associations.
Given their angular separations, these systems are most likely galaxy over-densities and/or early-stage
pre-coalescence mergers. Finally, we present 3mm LMT/RSR spectroscopic redshifts of six red-$Herschel$
galaxies at $z_{\rm spec}=3.85-6.03$, two of them (at $z \sim 4.7$) representing new redshift confirmations.
Here we release the AzTEC and deblended $Herschel$ photometry as well as catalogues of the most promising
interacting systems and $z>4$ galaxies.

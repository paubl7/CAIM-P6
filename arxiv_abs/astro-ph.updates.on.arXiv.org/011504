Binary neutron star associated with short Gamma ray burst has drawn wide attention ever since the
observation of GW170817, due to its potential application in cosmology. While, further application
of this sort of event suffers from the problem of degeneracy between luminosity distance and inclination
angle, especially in the face-on limit. In this paper, we aim to address this issue by taking into
account a Gaussian prior on the inclination angle. To test the property of resulting posterior distribution,
we generate four catalogues of 1000 events by varying the number of third-generation detectors
and the scale of prior. It turns out that a network of detectors tends to recognize more and farther
events than a single detector. Besides, adopting tighter prior and employing multiple detectors
both lead to lower error at given redshifts. Also considered is the validity of a widely adopted formula
$\sigma_{\Delta d_{\rm L}0} = 2d_{\rm L} / \rho$, which undergoes the change from overestimating
to underestimating with the increase of redshift. In the case of $\Lambda$CDM cosmology, 800, 300,
500 and 200 events are required for the four configurations to achieve $1\%$ $H_0$ accuracy. With
all 1000 events in each catalogue, $H_0$ can be constrained to $0.9\%$, $0.4\%$, $0.7\%$ and $0.4\%$,
while the errors of $\Omega_m$ are 0.014, 0.008, 0.016 and 0.012 respectively. Besides, adopting
$\sigma_{\Delta d_{\rm L}0}$ leads to underestimation on the errors of cosmological parameters
for tighter prior and overestimation in the opposite case. Results of Gaussian process also show
that gravitational wave standard siren can reach higher redshift than traditional standard candles,
especially when a network of detector is available, while alteration of the prior only has insignificant
impact.

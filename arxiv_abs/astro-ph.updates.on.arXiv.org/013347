In this ISSI-supported series of studies on magnetic helicity in the Sun, we systematically implement
different magnetic helicity calculation methods on high-quality solar magnetogram observations.
We apply finite-volume, discrete flux tube (in particular, connectivity-based) and flux-integration
methods to data from Hinode's Solar Optical Telescope. The target is NOAA active region 10930 during
a ~1.5 day interval in December 2006 that included a major eruptive flare (SOL2006-12-13T02:14X3.4).
Finite-volume and connectivity-based methods yield instantaneous budgets of the coronal magnetic
helicity, while the flux-integration methods allow an estimate of the accumulated helicity injected
through the photosphere. The objectives of our work are twofold: A cross-validation of methods,
as well as an interpretation of the complex events leading to the eruption. To the first objective,
we find (i) strong agreement among the finite-volume methods, (ii) a moderate agreement between
the connectivity-based and finite-volume methods, (iii) an excellent agreement between the flux-integration
methods, and (iv) an overall agreement between finite-volume and flux-integration based estimates
regarding the predominant sign and magnitude of the helicity. To the second objective, we are confident
that the photospheric helicity flux significantly contributed to the coronal helicity budget,
and that a right-handed structure erupted from a predominantly left-handed corona during the X-class
flare. Overall, we find that the use of different methods to estimate the (accumulated) coronal
helicity may be necessary in order to draw a complete picture of an active-region corona, given the
careful handling of identified data (preparation) issues, which otherwise would mislead the event
analysis and interpretation.

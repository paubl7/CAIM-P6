Centaurs are small bodies orbiting in the giant planet region which were scattered inwards from
their source populations beyond Neptune. Some members of the population display comet-like activity
during their transition through the solar system, the source of which is not well understood. The
range of heliocentric distances where the active Centaurs have been observed, and their median
lifetime in the region suggest this activity is neither driven by water-ice sublimation, nor entirely
by super-volatiles. Here we present an observational and thermo-dynamical study of 13 Centaurs
discovered in the Pan-STARRS1 detection database aimed at identifying and characterizing active
objects beyond the orbit of Jupiter. We find no evidence of activity associated with any of our targets
at the time of their observations with the Gemini North telescope in 2017 and 2018, or in archival
data from 2013 to 2019. Upper limits on the possible volatile and dust production rates from our targets
are 1-2 orders of magnitude lower than production rates in some known comets, and are in agreement
with values measured for other inactive Centaurs. Our numerical integrations show that the orbits
of six of our targets evolved interior to r$\sim$15 AU over the past 100,000 years where several possible
processes could trigger sublimation and outgassing, but their apparent inactivity indicates
their dust production is either below our detection limit or that the objects are dormant. Only one
Centaur in our sample -- 2014 PQ$_{70}$ experienced a sudden decrease in semi-major axis and perihelion
distance attributed to the onset of activity for some previously known inactive Centaurs, and therefore
is a likely candidate for future outburst. This object should be a target of interest for further
observational monitoring.

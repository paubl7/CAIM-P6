The Multi-slit Solar Explorer (MUSE) is a proposed NASA MIDEX mission, currently in Phase A, composed
of a multi-slit EUV spectrograph (in three narrow spectral bands centered around 171A, 284A, and
108A) and an EUV context imager (in two narrow passbands around 195A and 304A). MUSE will provide
unprecedented spectral and imaging diagnostics of the solar corona at high spatial (<0.5 arcsec),
and temporal resolution (down to ~0.5s) thanks to its innovative multi-slit design. By obtaining
spectra in 4 bright EUV lines (Fe IX 171A , Fe XV 284A, Fe XIX-Fe XXI 108A) covering a wide range of transition
region and coronal temperatures along 37 slits simultaneously, MUSE will for the first time be able
to "freeze" (at a cadence as short as 10 seconds) with a spectroscopic raster the evolution of the
dynamic coronal plasma over a wide range of scales: from the spatial scales on which energy is released
(~0.5 arcsec) to the large-scale often active-region size (170 arcsec x 170 arcsec) atmospheric
response. We use advanced numerical modeling to showcase how MUSE will constrain the properties
of the solar atmosphere on the spatio-temporal scales (~0.5 arcsec, ~20 seconds) and large field-of-view
on which various state-of-the-art models of the physical processes that drive coronal heating,
solar flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) make distinguishing and testable predictions.
We describe how the synergy between MUSE, the single-slit, high-resolution Solar-C EUVST spectrograph,
and ground-based observatories (DKIST and others) can address how the solar atmosphere is energized,
and the critical role MUSE plays because of the multi-scale nature of the physical processes involved.
In this first paper, we focus on how comparisons between MUSE observations and theoretical models
will significantly further our understanding of coronal heating mechanisms.

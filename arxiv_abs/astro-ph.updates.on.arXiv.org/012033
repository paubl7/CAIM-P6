High resolution precision spectroscopy provides a multitude of robust techniques for probing
exoplanetary atmospheres. We present multiple VLT/ESPRESSO transit observations of the hot-Jupiter
exoplanet WASP-19b with previously published but disputed atmospheric features from low resolution
studies. Through spectral synthesis and modeling of the Rossiter-McLaughlin (RM) effect we calculate
stellar, orbital and physical parameters for the system. From narrow-band spectroscopy we do not
detect any of H\,I, Fe\,I, Mg\,I, Ca\,I, Na\,I and K\,I neutral species, placing upper limits on
their line contrasts. Through cross correlation analyses with atmospheric models, we do not detect
Fe\,I and place a 3$\sigma$ upper limit of $\log\,(X_{\textrm{Fe}}/X_\odot) \approx -1.83\,\pm\,0.11$
on its mass fraction, from injection and retrieval. We show the inability to detect the presence
of H$_2$O for known abundances, owing to lack of strong absorption bands, as well as relatively low
S/N ratio. We detect a barely significant peak (3.02\,$\pm$\,0.15\,$\sigma$) in the cross correlation
map for TiO, consistent with the sub-solar abundance previously reported. This is merely a hint
for the presence of TiO and does \textit{not} constitute a confirmation. However, we do confirm
the presence of previously observed enhanced scattering towards blue wavelengths, through chromatic
RM measurements, pointing to a hazy atmosphere. We finally present a reanalysis of low resolution
transmission spectra of this exoplanet, concluding that unocculted starspots alone cannot explain
previously detected features. Our reanalysis of the FORS2 spectra of WASP-19b finds a $\sim$\,100$\times$
sub-solar TiO abundance, precisely constrained to $\log\,X_{\textrm{TiO}} \approx -7.52 \pm
0.38$, consistent with the TiO hint from ESPRESSO. We present plausible paths to reconciliation
with other seemingly contradicting results.

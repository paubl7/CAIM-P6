In this work, we explore the diversity of ionised gas kinematics (rotational velocity $v_{\phi}$
and velocity dispersion $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$) and gas-phase metallicity gradients at $0.1
\leq z \leq 2.5$ using a compiled data set of 74 galaxies resolved with ground-based integral field
spectroscopy. We find that galaxies with the highest and the lowest $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$ have
preferentially flat metallicity gradients, whereas those with intermediate values of $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$
show a large scatter in the metallicity gradients. Additionally, steep negative gradients appear
almost only in rotation-dominated galaxies ($v_{\phi}/\sigma_{\mathrm{g}} > 1$), whereas most
dispersion-dominated galaxies show flat gradients. We use our recently developed analytic model
of metallicity gradients to provide a physical explanation for the shape and scatter of these observed
trends. In the case of high $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$, the inward radial advection of gas dominates
over metal production and causes efficient metal mixing, thus giving rise to flat gradients. For
low $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$, it is the cosmic accretion of metal-poor gas diluting the metallicity
that gives rise to flat gradients. Finally, the reason for intermediate $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$
showing the steepest negative gradients is that both inward radial advection and cosmic accretion
are weak as compared to metal production, which leads to the creation of steeper gradients. The larger
scatter at intermediate $\sigma_{\mathrm{g}}$ may be due in part to preferential ejection of metals
in galactic winds, which can decrease the strength of the production term. Our analysis shows how
gas kinematics play a critical role in setting metallicity gradients in high-redshift galaxies.

The CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite (CHEOPS) was selected in 2012, as the first small mission
in the ESA Science Programme and successfully launched in December 2019. CHEOPS is a partnership
between ESA and Switzerland with important contributions by ten additional ESA Member States.
CHEOPS is the first mission dedicated to search for transits of exoplanets using ultrahigh precision
photometry on bright stars already known to host planets. As a follow-up mission, CHEOPS is mainly
dedicated to improving, whenever possible, existing radii measurements or provide first accurate
measurements for a subset of those planets for which the mass has already been estimated from ground-based
spectroscopic surveys and to following phase curves. CHEOPS will provide prime targets for future
spectroscopic atmospheric characterisation. Requirements on the photometric precision and
stability have been derived for stars with magnitudes ranging from 6 to 12 in the V band. In particular,
CHEOPS shall be able to detect Earth-size planets transiting G5 dwarf stars in the magnitude range
between 6 and 9 by achieving a photometric precision of 20 ppm in 6 hours of integration. For K stars
in the magnitude range between 9 and 12, CHEOPS shall be able to detect transiting Neptune-size planets
achieving a photometric precision of 85 ppm in 3 hours of integration. This is achieved by using a
single, frame-transfer, back-illuminated CCD detector at the focal plane assembly of a 33.5 cm
diameter telescope. The 280 kg spacecraft has a pointing accuracy of about 1 arcsec rms and orbits
on a sun-synchronous dusk-dawn orbit at 700 km altitude. The nominal mission lifetime is 3.5 years.
During this period, 20% of the observing time is available to the community through a yearly call
and a discretionary time programme managed by ESA.

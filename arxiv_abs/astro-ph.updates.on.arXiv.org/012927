It is generally accepted that CMEs result from eruptions of magnetic flux ropes, which are dubbed
as magnetic clouds in interplanetary space. The composition (including the ionic charge states
and elemental abundances) is determined prior to and/or during CME eruptions in the solar atmosphere,
and does not alter during magnetic cloud propagation to 1 AU and beyond. It has been known that the
composition is not uniform within a cross section perpendicular to magnetic cloud axis, and the
distribution of ionic charge states within a cross section provides us an important clue to investigate
the formation and eruption processes of flux ropes due to the freeze-in effect. The flux rope is a
three dimensional magnetic structure intrinsically, and it remains unclear whether the composition
is uniform along the flux rope axis as most magnetic clouds are only detected by one spacecraft. In
this paper we report a magnetic cloud that was observed by ACE near 1 AU on 1998 March 4--6 and Ulysses
near 5.4 AU on March 24--28 sequentially. At these times, both spacecraft were located around the
ecliptic plane, and the latitudinal and longitudinal separations between them were $\sim$2.2$^{\circ}$
and $\sim$5.5$^{\circ}$, respectively. It provides us an excellent opportunity to explore the
axial inhomogeneity of flux rope composition, as both spacecraft almost intersected the cloud
center at different sites along its axis. Our study shows that the average values of ionic charge
states exhibit significant difference along the axis for carbon, and the differences are relatively
slight but still obvious for charge states of oxygen and iron, as well as the elemental abundances
of iron and helium. Besides the means, the composition profiles within the cloud measured by both
spacecraft also exhibit some discrepancies. We conclude that the inhomogeneity of composition
exists along the cloud axis.

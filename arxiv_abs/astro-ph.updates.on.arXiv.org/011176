We examine the X-ray, optical, and radio properties for the members clusters of a new supercluster
discovered during the SRG/eROSITA Performance Verification phase. In the 140 deg2 eROSITA Final
Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) field we detect a previously unknown supercluster consisting
of a chain of eight galaxy clusters at z=0.36. The redshifts of these members are determined through
HSC photometric measurements. We examine the X-ray morphological and dynamical properties, gas
and total mass out to R500 of the members and compare them with the general population of clusters
detected in the eFEDS field. We further investigate the gas in the bridge region between the cluster
members for a potential WHIM detection. Radio follow-up observations with LOFAR and uGMRT are used
to search for diffuse emission and constrain the dynamic state of the system. We do not find significant
differences in the morphological parameters and properties of the intra-cluster medium of the
clusters embedded in this large-scale filament compared to eFEDS clusters. We also provide upper
limits on the electron number density and mass of the warm-hot intergalactic medium as provided
by the eROSITA data. These limits are consistent with previously reported values for the detections
in the vicinity of clusters of galaxies. In LOFAR and uGMRT follow-up observations of the northern
part of this supercluster we find two new radio relics that are the result of major merger activity
in the system. These early results show the potential of eROSITA to probe large-scale structures
such as superclusters and the properties of their members. Our forecasts show that we will be able
to detect 450 superclusters with 3000 member clusters located in the eROSITA_DE region at the final
eROSITA all-sky survey depth, enabling statistical studies of the properties of superclusters
and their constituents embedded in the cosmic web.

Accurately modelling the complete gravitational-wave signal from precessing binary black holes
through the late inspiral, merger and ringdown remains a challenging problem. The lack of analytic
solutions for the precession dynamics of generic double-spin systems, and the high dimensionality
of the problem, obfuscate the incorporation of strong-field spin-precession information into
semi-analytic waveform models used in gravitational-wave data analysis. Previously, an effective
precession spin, $\chi_p$, was introduced to reduce the number of spin degrees of freedom. Here,
we show that $\chi_p$ alone does not accurately reproduce higher-order multipolar modes, in particular
the ones that carry strong imprints due to precession such as the $(2,1)$-mode. To improve the higher-mode
content, and in particular to facilitate an accurate incorporation of precession effects in the
strong-field regime into waveform models, we introduce a new dimensional reduction through an
effective precession spin vector, $\vec{\chi}_\perp$, which takes into account precessing spin
information from both black holes. We show that this adapted effective precession spin (i) mimics
the precession dynamics of the fully precessing configuration remarkably well, (ii) captures
the signature features of precession in higher-order modes, and (iii) reproduces the final state
of the remnant black hole with high accuracy for the overwhelming majority of configurations. We
demonstrate the efficacy of this two-dimensional precession spin in the strong-field regime,
paving the path for meaningful calibration of the precessing sector of semi-analytic waveform
models with a faithful representation of higher-order modes through merger and the remnant black
hole spin.

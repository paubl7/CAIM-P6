A quasi-static approximation (QSA) for modified gravity can be applied in a number of ways. We consider
three different analytical formulations based on applying this approximation to: (1) the field
equations; (2) the equations for the two metric potentials; (3) the use of the attractor solution
derived within the Equation of State (EoS) approach. We assess the veracity of these implementations
on the effective gravitational constant ($\mu$) and the slip parameter ($\eta$), within the framework
of Horndeski models. In particular, for a set of models we compare cosmological observables, i.e.,
the matter power spectrum and the CMB temperature and lensing angular power spectra, computed using
the QSA, with exact numerical solutions. To do that, we use a newly developed branch of the CLASS code:
QSA_class. All three approaches agree exactly on very small scales. Typically, we find that, except
for $f(R)$ models where all the three approaches lead to the same result, the quasi-static approximations
differ from the numerical calculations on large scales ($k \lesssim 3 - 4 \times 10^{-3}\,h\,{\rm
Mpc}^{-1}$). Cosmological observables are reproduced to within 1% up to scales ${\rm K} = k/H_0$
of the order of a few and $\ell>5$ for the approaches based on the field equations and on the EoS, and
we also do not find any appreciable difference if we use the scale-dependent expressions for $\mu$
and $\eta$ with respect to the value on small scales, showing that the formalism and the conclusions
are reliable and robust, fixing the range of applicability of the formalism. We discuss why the expressions
derived from the equations for the potentials have limited applicability. Our results are in agreement
with previous analytical estimates and show that the QSA is a reliable tool and can be used for comparison
with current and future observations to constrain models beyond $\Lambda$CDM.

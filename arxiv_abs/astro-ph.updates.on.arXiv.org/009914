We analyze 1598 serendipitous Chandra X-ray observations of 462 radio-quiet quasars to constrain
the frequency of extreme amplitude X-ray variability that is intrinsic to the quasar corona and
innermost accretion flow. The quasars in this investigation are all spectroscopically confirmed,
optically bright ($m_i \leq$ 20.2), and contain no identifiable broad absorption lines in their
optical/ultraviolet spectra. This sample includes quasars spanning $z \approx$ 0.1 - 4 and probes
X-ray variability on timescales of up to $\approx$ 12 rest-frame years. Variability amplitudes
are computed between every epoch of observation for each quasar and are analyzed as a function of
timescale and luminosity. The tail-heavy distributions of variability amplitudes at all timescales
indicate that extreme X-ray variations are driven by an additional physical mechanism and not just
typical random fluctuations of the coronal emission. Similarly, extreme X-ray variations of low-luminosity
quasars seem to be driven by an additional physical mechanism, whereas high-luminosity quasars
seem more consistent with random fluctuations. The amplitude at which an X-ray variability event
can be considered extreme is quantified for different timescales and luminosities. Extreme X-ray
variations occur more frequently at long timescales ( $\Delta t \gtrsim$ 300 days) than at shorter
timescales, and in low-luminosity quasars compared to high-luminosity quasars over a similar
timescale. A binomial analysis indicates that extreme intrinsic X-ray variations are rare, with
a maximum occurrence rate of <2.4% of observations. Finally, we present X-ray variability and basic
optical emission-line properties of three archival quasars that have been newly discovered to
exhibit extreme X-ray variability.

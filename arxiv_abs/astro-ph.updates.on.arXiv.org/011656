In the past few years, the detection of gravitational waves from compact binary coalescences with
the Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo detectors has become routine. Future observatories will detect
even larger numbers of gravitational-wave signals, which will also spend a longer time in the detectors'
sensitive band. This will eventually lead to overlapping signals, especially in the case of Einstein
Telescope (ET) and Cosmic Explorer (CE). Using realistic distributions for the merger rate as a
function of redshift as well as for component masses in binary neutron star and binary black hole
coalescences, we map out how often signal overlaps of various types will occur in an ET-CE network
over the course of a year. We find that a binary neutron star signal will typically have tens of overlapping
binary black hole and binary neutron star signals. Moreover, it will happen up to tens of thousands
of times per year that two signals will have their end times within seconds of each other. In order
to understand to what extent this would lead to measurement biases with current parameter estimation
methodology, we perform injection studies with overlapping signals from binary black hole and/or
binary neutron star coalescences. Varying the signal-to-noise ratios, the durations of overlap,
and the kinds of overlapping signals, we find that in most scenarios the intrinsic parameters can
be recovered with negligible bias. However, biases do occur for a short binary black hole or a quieter
binary neutron star signal overlapping with a long and louder binary neutron star event when the
merger times are sufficiently close. Hence our studies show where improvements are required to
ensure reliable estimation of source parameters for all detected compact binary signals as we go
from second-generation to third-generation detectors.

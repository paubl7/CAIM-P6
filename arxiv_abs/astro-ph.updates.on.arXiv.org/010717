The presence of rings and gaps in protoplanetary discs are often ascribed to planet-disc interactions,
where dust and pebbles are trapped at the edges of planetary induced gas gaps. Recent work has shown
that these are likely sites for planetesimal formation via the streaming instability. Given the
large amount of planetesimals that potentially form at gap edges, we address the question of their
fate and ability to radially transport solids in protoplanetary discs. We perform a series of N-body
simulations of planetesimal orbits, taking into account the effect of gas drag and mass loss via
ablation. We consider two planetary systems: one akin to the young Solar System, and another one
inspired by HL Tau. In both systems, the close proximity to the gap-opening planets results in large
orbital excitations, causing the planetesimals to leave their birth locations and spread out across
the disc soon after formation. Planetesimals that end up on eccentric orbits interior of 10au experience
efficient ablation, and lose all mass before they reach the innermost disc region. In our nominal
Solar System simulation with $\dot{M}_0=10^{-7}\, M_{\odot}\, \textrm{yr}^{-1}$ and $\alpha=10^{-2}$,
we find that 70% of the initial planetesimal mass has been ablated after 500kyr. The ablation rate
in HL Tau is lower, and only 11% of the initial planetesimal mass has been ablated after 1Myr. The ablated
material consist of a mixture of solid grains and vaporized ices, where a large fraction of the vaporized
ices re-condense to form solid ice. Assuming that the solids grow to pebbles in the disc midplane,
the total integrated mass that reaches 1au is $15\, M_{\oplus}$ in the nominal Solar System simulation
and $25\, M_{\oplus}$ in the nominal HL Tau simulation. Our results demonstrate that scattered
planetesimals can carry a significant flux of solids past planetary-induced gaps in protoplanetary
discs.

This article discusses the effects of the spiral-arm corotation on the stellar dynamics in the Solar
Neighborhood (SN). All our results presented here rely on: 1) observational evidence that the Sun
lies near the corotation circle, where stars rotate with the same angular velocity as the spiral-arm
pattern; the corotation circle establishes domains of the corotation resonance (CR) in the Galactic
disk; 2) dynamical constraints that put the spiral-arm potential as the dominant perturbation
in the SN, comparing with the effects of the central bar in the SN; 3) a long-lived nature of the spiral
structure, promoting a state of dynamical relaxing and phase-mixing of the stellar orbits in response
to the spiral perturbation. With an analytical model for the Galactic potential, composed of an
axisymmetric background deduced from the observed rotation curve, and perturbed by a four-armed
spiral pattern, numerical simulations of stellar orbits are performed to delineate the domains
of regular and chaotic motions shaped by the resonances. Such studies show that stars can be trapped
inside the stable zones of the spiral CR, and this orbital trapping mechanism could explain the dynamical
origin of the Local arm of the Milky Way (MW). The spiral CR and the near high-order epicyclic resonances
influence the velocity distribution in the SN, creating the observable structures such as moving
groups and their radially extended counterpart known as diagonal ridges. The Sun and most of the
SN stars evolve inside a stable zone of the spiral CR, never crossing the main spiral-arm structure,
but oscillating in the region between the Sagittarius-Carina and Perseus arms. This orbital behavior
of the Sun brings insights to our understanding of questions concerning the solar system evolution,
the Earth environment changes, and the preservation of life on Earth.

Thermal phase variations of short period planets indicate that they are not spherical cows: day-to-night
temperature contrasts range from hundreds to thousands of degrees, rivaling their vertical temperature
contrasts. Nonetheless, the emergent spectra of short-period planets have typically been fit
using one-dimensional (1D) spectral retrieval codes that only account for vertical temperature
gradients. The popularity of 1D spectral retrieval codes is easy to understand: they are robust
and have a rich legacy in Solar System atmospheric studies. Exoplanet researchers have recently
introduced multi-dimensional retrieval schemes for interpreting the spectra of short-period
planets, but these codes are necessarily more complex and computationally expensive than their
1D counterparts. In this paper we present an alternative: phase-dependent spectral observations
are inverted to produce longitudinally resolved spectra that can then be fitted using standard
1D spectral retrieval codes. We test this scheme on the iconic phase-resolved spectra of WASP-43b
and on simulated JWST observations using the open-source pyratbay 1D spectral retrieval framework.
Notably, we take the model complexity of the simulations one step further over previous studies
by allowing for longitudinal variations in composition in addition to temperature. We show that
performing 1D spectral retrieval on longitudinally resolved spectra is more accurate than applying
1D spectral retrieval codes to disk-integrated emission spectra, despite being identical in terms
of computational load. We find that for the extant Hubble and Spitzer observations of WASP-43b the
difference between the two approaches is negligible but that JWST phase measurements should be
treated with longitudinally \textbf{re}solved \textbf{spect}ral retrieval (ReSpect).

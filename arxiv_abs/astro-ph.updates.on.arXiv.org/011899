Context. The properties of the population of the Galactic Supernova Remnants (SNRs) are essential
to our understanding of the dynamics of the Milky Way's interstellar medium (ISM). However, the
completeness of the catalog of Galactic SNRs is expected to be only ${\sim}30\%$, with on order 700
SNRs yet to be detected. Deep interferometric radio continuum surveys of the Galactic plane help
in rectifying this apparent deficiency by identifying low surface brightness SNRs and compact
SNRs that have not been detected in previous surveys. However, SNRs are routinely confused with
H II regions, which can have similar radio morphologies. Radio spectral index, polarization, and
emission at mid-infrared (MIR) wavelengths can help distinguish between SNRs and H II regions.
Aims. We aim to identify SNR candidates using continuum emission from the Karl G. Jansky Very Large
Array Global view of the Star formation in the Milky Way (GLOSTAR) survey. Methods. GLOSTAR is a C-band
(4--8 GHz) radio wavelength survey of the Galactic plane covering $358<l<60, |b|<1$. The continuum
images from this survey that resulted from observations in the array's most compact configuration
have an angular resolution of $18''$. We searched for SNRs in these images to identify known SNRs,
previously-identified SNR candidates and new SNR candidates. We study these objects in MIR surveys
and the GLOSTAR polarization data to classify their emission as thermal or nonthermal. Results.
We identify 157 SNR candidates, out of which 80 are new. Polarization measurements provide evidence
of nonthermal emission from 9 of these candidates. We find that two previously identified candidates
are filaments. We also detect emission from 91 out of 94 known SNRs in the survey region. Four of these
are reclassified as H II regions following detection in MIR surveys. (Abridged)

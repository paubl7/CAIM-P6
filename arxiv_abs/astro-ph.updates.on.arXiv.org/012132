At relatively high frequencies, highly sensitive grating sidelobes occur in the primary beam patterns
of low frequency aperture arrays (LFAA) such as the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA). This occurs
when the observing wavelength becomes comparable to the dipole separation for LFAA tiles, which
for the MWA occurs at approximately 300 MHz. The presence of these grating sidelobes has made calibration
and image processing for 300 MHz MWA observations difficult. This work presents a new calibration
and imaging strategy which employs existing techniques to process two example 300 MHz MWA observations.
Observations are initially calibrated using a new 300 MHz sky-model which has been interpolated
from low frequency and high frequency all-sky surveys. Using this 300 MHz model in conjunction with
the accurate MWA tile primary beam model, we perform sky-model calibration for the two example observations.
After initial calibration a self-calibration loop is performed by all-sky imaging each observation
with WSCLEAN. Using the output all-sky image we mask the main lobe of the image. Using this masked
image we perform a sky-subtraction by estimating the masked image visibilities using WSCLEAN.
We then image the main lobe of the observations with WSCLEAN. This results in high dynamic range images
of the two example observation main lobes. These images have a resolution of 2.4 arcminutes, with
a maximum sensitivity of 31 mJy/beam. The calibration and imaging strategy demonstrated in this
work, opens the door to performing science at 300 MHz with the MWA, which was previously an inaccessible
domain. With this paper we release the code described below and the cross-matched catalogue along
with the code to produce a sky-model in the range 70-1400 MHz.

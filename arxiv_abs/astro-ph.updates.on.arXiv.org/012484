Thermal gas in the center of galaxy clusters can show substantial motions that generate surface-brightness
and temperature discontinuities known as cold fronts. The motions may be triggered by minor or off-axis
mergers that preserve the cool core of the system. The dynamics of the thermal gas can also generate
radio emission from the intra-cluster medium (ICM) and impact the evolution of clusters' radio
sources. We aim to study the central region of Abell 1775, a system in an ambiguous dynamical state
at $z=0.072$ which is known to host an extended head-tail radio galaxy, with the goal of investigating
the connection between thermal and nonthermal components in its center. We made use of a deep (100
ks) Chandra observation accompanied by LOFAR 144 MHz, GMRT 235 MHz and 610 MHz, and VLA 1.4 GHz radio
data. We find a spiral-like pattern in the X-ray surface brightness that is mirrored in the temperature
and pseudo-entropy maps. Additionally, we characterize an arc-shaped cold front in the ICM. We
interpret these features in the context of a slingshot gas tail scenario. The structure of the head-tail
radio galaxy "breaks" at the position of the cold front, showing an extension that is detected only
at low frequencies, likely due to its steep and curved spectrum. We speculate that particle reacceleration
is occurring in the outer region of this tail, which in total covers a projected size of $\sim800$
kpc. We also report the discovery of revived fossil plasma with ultra-steep spectrum radio emission
in the cluster core together with a central diffuse radio source that is bounded by the arc-shaped
cold front. The results reported in this work demonstrate the interplay between thermal and nonthermal
components in the cluster center and the presence of ongoing particle reacceleration in the ICM
on different scales.

Most students do not enroll in introductory astronomy as part of their major; for many, it is the last
science course they will ever take. Thus, it has great potential to shape students' attitudes toward
STEM fields for the rest of their life. We therefore argue that it is less important, when assessing
the effectiveness of introductory astronomy courses, to explore traditional curricular learning
gains than to explore the effects that various course components have on this attitude. We describe
the results of our analysis of end-of-semester surveys returned by a total of 749 students in 2014-2015,
at 10 institutions that employed at least part of the introductory astronomy lecture and lab curriculum
we first implemented at UNC-Chapel Hill in 2009. Surveys were designed to measure each student's
attitude, and to probe the correlation of attitude with their utilization of, and satisfaction
with, various course components, along with other measures of their academic background and their
self-assessed performance in the course. We find that students' attitudes are significantly positively
correlated with the grade they expect to receive, and their rating of the course's overall effectiveness.
To a lesser degree, we find that students' attitudes are positively correlated with their mathematical
background, whether they intend to major or pursue a career in STEM, and their rating of the effectiveness
of the instructor. We find that students' attitudes are negatively correlated with the amount of
work they perceived the course to involve, and, surprisingly, the size and reputation of their home
institution. We also find that, for the subsets of students who were exposed to them, students' attitudes
are positively correlated with their perception of the helpfulness of the lecture component of
the course, and of telescope-based labs that utilized UNC-CH's Skynet Robotic Telescope Network.

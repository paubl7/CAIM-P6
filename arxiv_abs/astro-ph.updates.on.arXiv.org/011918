[Abridged] Aims. We present a large atmospheric study of 49 gas giant exoplanets using infrared
transmission photometry with Spitzer/IRAC at 3.6 and 4.5um. Methods. We uniformly analyze 70 photometric
light curves of 33 transiting planets using our custom pipeline, which implements pixel level decorrelation.
We use this survey to understand how infrared photometry traces changes in atmospheric chemical
properties as a function of planetary temperature. We compare our measurements to a grid of 1D radiative-convective
equilibrium forward atmospheric models which include disequilibrium chemistry. We explore various
strengths of vertical mixing (Kzz = 0 - 10^12 cm2/s) as well as two chemical compositions (1x and 30x
solar). Results. We find that, on average, Spitzer probes a difference of 0.5 atmospheric scale
heights between 3.6 and 4.5um, which is measured at 7.5sigma level of significance. We find that
the coolest planets show a lack of methane compared to expectations, which has also been reported
by previous studies of individual objects. We show that the sample of coolest planets rule out 1x
solar composition with >3sigma confidence while supporting low vertical mixing (Kzz = 10^8 cm2/s).
On the other hand, we find that the hot planets are best explained by models with 1x solar metallicity
and high vertical mixing (Kzz = 10^12 cm2/s). We interpret this as the lofting of CH4 to the upper atmospheric
layers. Changing the interior temperature changes the expectation for equilibrium chemistry
in deep layers, hence the expectation of disequilibrium chemistry higher up. We also find a significant
scatter in the transmission signatures of the mid-temperate and ultra-hot planets, likely due
to increased atmospheric diversity, without the need to invoke higher metallicities. Additionally,
we compare Spitzer transmission with emission for the same planets and find no evidence for correlation.

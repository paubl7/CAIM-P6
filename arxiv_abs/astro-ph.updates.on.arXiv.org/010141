Context. Stars on the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) are long-period variables that present strong
flux variations at almost all wavelengths, including the SiO maser lines. The periods of these variations
are of 300-500 days in Mira-type stars and somewhat shorter in semi-regular variables. The variability
of the SiO lines on short timescales has been investigated, but the data are inconclusive. Aims.
We aim to study the time evolution of the SiO maser lines in Mira-type and semi-regular variables
at short timescales. We also discuss the origin of the observed fast variations. Methods. We observed
the SiO maser lines at 7 mm (28SiO v=1,2 J=1-0) and 3 mm (28SiO v=1 J=2-1) using the 40 m Yebes antenna
and the 30 m IRAM telescope, respectively, with a minimum spacing of 1 day. We studied the semi-regular
variables RX Boo and RT Vir and the Mira-type variables U Her, R LMi, R Leo, and $\chi$ Cyg. We performed
a detailed statistical analysis of the variations on different timescales. Results. RX Boo shows
strong and fast variations in the intensity of the different spectral features of the SiO lines at
7 mm and 3 mm. On a timescale of one day, we find variations of >10% in 25% of the cases. Variations of
greater than $\sim$50% are often found when the observations are separated by 2 or 3 days. A similar
variation rate of the SiO lines at 7 mm is found for RT Vir, but the observations of this object are less
complete. On the contrary, the variations of the SiO maser line intensity in the Mira-type variables
are moderate, with typical variation rates around <10% in 7 days. This phenomenon can be explained
by the presence of particularly small maser-emitting clumps in semi-regular variables, which
would lead to a strong dependence of the intensity on the density variations due to the passage of
shocks.

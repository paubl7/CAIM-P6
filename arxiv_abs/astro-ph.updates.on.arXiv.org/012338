The origin of Galactic cosmic rays remains a matter of debate, but supernova remnants are commonly
considered to be the main place where high-energy cosmic rays are accelerated. Nevertheless, current
models predict cosmic-ray spectra that do not match observations and the efficiency of the acceleration
mechanism is still undetermined. On the other hand, the contribution of other kinds of sources to
the Galactic cosmic-ray population is still unclear, and merits investigation. In this work we
explore a novel mechanism through which microquasars might produce cosmic rays. In this scenario,
microquasar jets generate relativistic neutrons, which escape and decay outside the system; protons
and electrons, created when these neutrons decay, escape to the interstellar medium as cosmic rays.
The most promising scenarios arise in extremely luminous systems ($L_\mathrm{jet} \sim 10^{40}\,\mathrm{erg
\, s}^{-1}$), in which the fraction of jet power deposited in cosmic rays can reach $\sim 0.001$.
Slow jets ($\Gamma \lesssim 2$, where $\Gamma$ is the bulk Lorentz factor) favour neutron production.
The resulting cosmic-ray spectrum is similar for protons and electrons, which share the power in
the ratio given by neutron decay. The spectrum peaks at roughly half the minimum energy of the relativistic
protons in the jet; it is soft (spectral index $\sim 3$) above this energy, and almost flat below.
Values of spectral index steeper than $2$ are possible for cosmic rays in our model and these indeed
agree with those required to explain the spectral signatures of Galactic cosmic rays, although
only the most extreme microquasars provide power comparable to that of a typical supernova remnant.
The mechanism explored in this work may provide stronger and softer cosmic-ray sources in the early
Universe, and therefore contribute to the heating and reionisation of the intergalactic medium.

We present the multiple stellar systems observed within the SpHere INfrared survey for Exoplanet
(SHINE). SHINE searched for substellar companions to young stars using high contrast imaging.
Although stars with known stellar companions within SPHERE field of view (<5.5 arcsec) were removed
from the original target list, we detected additional stellar companions to 78 of the 463 SHINE targets
observed so far. 27% of the systems have three or more components. Given the heterogeneity of the
sample in terms of observing conditions and strategy, tailored routines were used for data reduction
and analysis, some of which were specifically designed for these data sets. We then combined SPHERE
data with literature and archival ones, TESS light curves and Gaia parallaxes and proper motions,
to characterise these systems as completely as possible. Combining all data, we were able to constrain
the orbits of 25 systems. We carefully assessed the completeness of our sample for the separation
range 50-500 mas (period range a few years - a few tens of years), taking into account the initial selection
biases and recovering part of the systems excluded from the original list due to their multiplicity.
This allowed us to compare the binary frequency for our sample with previous studies and highlight
some interesting trends in the mass ratio and period distribution. We also found that, for the few
objects for which such estimate was possible, the values of the masses derived from dynamical arguments
were in good agreement with the model predictions. Stellar and orbital spins appear fairly well
aligned for the 12 stars having enough data, which favour a disk fragmentation origin. Our results
highlight the importance of combining different techniques when tackling complex problems such
as the formation of binaries and show how large samples can be useful for more than one purpose.

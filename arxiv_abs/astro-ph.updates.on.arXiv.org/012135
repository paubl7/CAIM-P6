We aim to determine the mass, velocity anisotropy, and pseudo phase-space density profiles (M(r),
beta(r), and Q(r), respectively) of clusters of galaxies at the highest redshifts investigated
in detail so far. We combine the GOGREEN and GCLASS spectroscopic data-sets for 14 clusters with
mass M200 > 10^14 Msolar at redshifts 0.9 < z < 1.4. We stack these 14 clusters into an ensemble cluster
of 581 member galaxies with stellar mass > 10^9.5 M_solar. We use the MAMPOSSt method and the inversion
of the Jeans equation technique to determine M(r) and beta(r). We then combine the results of the
M(r) and beta(r) analysis to determine Q(r) for the ensemble cluster. The concentration c200 of
the ensemble cluster M(r) is in excellent agreement with predictions from LambdaCDM cosmological
numerical simulations, and with previous determinations for clusters of similar mass and at similar
redshifts, obtained from gravitational lensing and X-ray data. We see no significant difference
between the total mass density and either the galaxy number density distributions or the stellar
mass distribution. Star-forming galaxies are spatially significantly less concentrated than
quiescent galaxies. The orbits of cluster galaxies are isotropic near the center and more radial
outside. Star-forming galaxies and galaxies of low stellar mass tend to move on more radially elongated
orbits than quiescent galaxies and galaxies of high stellar mass. Q(r), determined either using
the total mass or the number density profile, is very close to the power-law behavior predicted by
numerical simulations. The internal dynamics of clusters at the highest redshift probed in detail
so far are very similar to those of lower-redshift clusters, and in excellent agreement with predictions
of numerical simulations. The clusters in our sample have already reached a high degree of dynamical
relaxation. (Abridged)

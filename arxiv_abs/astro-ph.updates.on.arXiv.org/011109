We present a new method for the mitigation of observational systematic effects in angular galaxy
clustering via corrective random galaxy catalogues. Real and synthetic galaxy data, from the Kilo
Degree Survey's (KiDS) 4$^{\rm{th}}$ Data Release (KiDS-$1000$) and the Full-sky Lognormal Astro-fields
Simulation Kit (FLASK) package respectively, are used to train self-organising maps (SOMs) to
learn the multivariate relationships between observed galaxy number density and up to six systematic-tracer
variables, including seeing, Galactic dust extinction, and Galactic stellar density. We then
create `organised' randoms, i.e. random galaxy catalogues with spatially variable number densities,
mimicking the learnt systematic density modes in the data. Using realistically biased mock data,
we show that these organised randoms consistently subtract spurious density modes from the two-point
angular correlation function $w(\vartheta)$, correcting biases of up to $12\sigma$ in the mean
clustering amplitude to as low as $0.1\sigma$, over a high signal-to-noise angular range of 7-100
arcmin. Their performance is also validated for angular clustering cross-correlations in a bright,
flux-limited subset of KiDS-$1000$, comparing against an analogous sample constructed from highly-complete
spectroscopic redshift data. Each organised random catalogue object is a `clone' carrying the
properties of a real galaxy, and is distributed throughout the survey footprint according to the
parent galaxy's position in systematics-space. Thus, sub-sample randoms are readily derived
from a single master random catalogue via the same selection as applied to the real galaxies. Our
method is expected to improve in performance with increased survey area, galaxy number density,
and systematic contamination, making organised randoms extremely promising for current and future
clustering analyses of faint samples.

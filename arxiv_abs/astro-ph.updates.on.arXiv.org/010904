Understanding the process of quenching is one of the major open questions in galaxy evolution, and
crucial insights may be obtained by studying quenched galaxies at high redshifts, at epochs when
the Universe and the galaxies were younger and simpler to model. However, establishing the degree
of quiescence in high redshift galaxies is a challenging task. One notable example is Hyde, a recently
discovered galaxy at z=3.709. As compact (r~0.5 kpc) and massive (M*~1e11 Msun) as its quenched
neighbor Jekyll, it is also extremely obscured yet only moderately luminous in the sub-millimeter.
Panchromatic modeling suggested it could be the first galaxy found in transition to quenching at
z>3, however the data were also consistent with a broad range of star-formation activity, including
moderate SFR in the lower scatter of the galaxy main-sequence (MS). Here, we describe ALMA observations
of the [CII] 157um and [NII] 205um far-infrared emission lines. The [CII] emission within the half-light
radius is dominated by ionized gas, while the outskirts are dominated by PDRs or neutral gas. This
suggests that the ionization in the center is not primarily powered by on-going star formation,
and could come instead from remnant stellar populations formed in an older burst, or from a moderate
AGN. Accounting for this information in the multi-wavelength modeling provides a tighter constraint
on the star formation rate of SFR=$50^{+24}_{-18}$ Msun/yr. This rules out fully quenched solutions,
and favors SFRs more than factor of two lower than expected for a galaxy on the MS, confirming the nature
of Hyde as a transition galaxy. Theses results suggest that quenching happens from inside-out,
and starts before the galaxy expels or consumes all its gas reservoirs. Similar observations of
a larger sample would determine whether this is an isolated case or the norm for quenching at high-redshift.

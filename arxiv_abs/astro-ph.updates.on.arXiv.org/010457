The solar photosphere provides us with a laboratory for understanding turbulence in a layer where
the fundamental processes of transport vary rapidly and a strongly superadiabatic region lies
very closely to a subadiabatic layer. Our tools for probing the turbulence are high-resolution
spectropolarimetric observations such as have recently been obtained with the two sunrise missions,
and numerical simulations. Our aim is to study photospheric turbulence with the help of Fourier
power spectra that we compute from observations and simulations. We also attempt to explain some
properties of the photospheric overshooting flow with the help of its governing equations and simulations.
We find that quiet-Sun observations and smeared simulations exhibit a power-law behavior in the
subgranular range of their Doppler velocity power spectra with an index of$~\approx -2$. The unsmeared
simulations exhibit a power-law index of$~\approx -2.25$. The smearing considerably reduces
the extent of the power-law-like portion of the spectra. Therefore, the limited spatial resolution
in some observations might eventually result in larger uncertainties in the estimation of the power-law
indices. The simulated vertical velocity power spectra as a function of height show a rapid change
in the power-law index from the solar surface to $300$~km above it. A scale-dependent transport
of the vertical momentum occurs. At smaller scales, the vertical momentum is more efficiently transported
sideways than at larger scales. This results in less vertical velocity power transported upward
at small scales than at larger scales and produces a progressively steeper vertical velocity power
law below $180$ km. Above this height, the gravity work progressively gains importance at all scales,
making the atmosphere progressively more hydrostatic and resulting in a gradually less steep power
law.

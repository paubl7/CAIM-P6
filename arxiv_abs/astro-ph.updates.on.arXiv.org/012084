Planck data provide precise constraints on cosmological parameters when assuming the base $\Lambda$CDM
model, including a 0.17\% measurement of the age of the Universe, $t_0=13.797 \pm 0.023\,{\rm Gyr}$.
However, the persistence of the "Hubble tension" calls the base $\Lambda$CDM model's completeness
into question and has spurred interest in models such as Early Dark Energy (EDE) that modify the assumed
expansion history of the Universe. We investigate the effect of EDE on the redshift-time relation
$z \leftrightarrow t$ and find that it differs from the base $\Lambda$CDM model by at least ${\approx}
4\%$ at all $t$ and $z$. As long as EDE remains observationally viable, any inferred $t \leftarrow
z$ or $z \leftarrow t$ quoted to a higher level of precision do not reflect the current status of our
understanding of cosmology. This uncertainty has important astrophysical implications: the
reionization epoch - $10>z>6$ - corresponds to disjoint lookback time periods in the base $\Lambda$CDM
and EDE models, and the EDE value of $t_0=13.25 \pm 0.17~{\rm Gyr}$ is in tension with published ages
of some stars, star clusters, and ultra-faint dwarf galaxies. However, most published stellar
ages do not include an uncertainty in accuracy (due to, e.g., uncertain distances and stellar microphysics)
that is estimated to be $\sim7-10\%$, potentially reconciling stellar ages with $t_{0,\rm EDE}$.
We discuss how the big data era for stars is providing extremely precise ages ($<1\%$) and how improved
distances and treatment of stellar microphysics such as convection could result in ages accurate
to $4-5\%$, comparable to the current accuracy of $t \leftrightarrow z$. Such precise and accurate
stellar ages can provide detailed insight into the high-redshift Universe independent of a cosmological
model.

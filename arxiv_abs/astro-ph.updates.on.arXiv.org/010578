Most of our current knowledge on planet formation is still based on the analysis of main-sequence,
solar-type stars. Conversely, detailed chemical studies of large samples of M-dwarf planet hosts
are still missing. We develop for the first time a methodology to determine stellar abundances of
elements others than iron for M dwarf stars from high-resolution, optical spectra. Our methodology
is based on the use of principal component analysis and sparse Bayesian's methods. We made use of
a set of M dwarfs orbiting around an FGK primary with known abundances to train our methods. We applied
our methods to derive stellar metalliticies and abundances of a large sample of M dwarfs observed
within the framework of current radial velocity surveys. We then used a sample of nearby FGK stars
to cross-validate our technique by comparing the derived abundance trends in the M dwarf sample
with those found on the FGK stars. The metallicity distribution of the different subsamples shows
that M dwarfs hosting giant planets show a planet-metallicity correlation as well as a correlation
with the stellar mass. M dwarfs hosting low-mass planets do not seem to follow the planet-metallicity
correlation. We also found that the frequency of low-mass planets does not depend on the mass of the
stellar host. These results seem in agreement with previous works. However, we note that for giant
planet hosts our metallicities predict a weaker planet metallicity correlation but a stronger
mass-dependency than photometric values. We show, for the first time, that there seems to be no differences
in the abundance distribution of elements different from iron between M dwarfs with and without
known planets. Our data shows that low-mass stars with planets follow the same metallicity, mass,
and abundance trends than their FGK counterparts.

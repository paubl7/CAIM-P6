In this work, we report our multi-wavelength observations of the transverse oscillation of a large
scale coronal loop with a length of 350 Mm. The oscillation was induced by a blowout coronal jet, which
was related to a circular ribbon flare (CRF) in AR 12434 on 2015 October 16. We aim to determine the
physical parameters in the coronal loop, including the Alfven speed and magnetic field strength.
The jet induced kink oscillation was observed in extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) wavelengths by the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) on board the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). Line of sight
magnetograms were observed by the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) on board SDO. We took several
slices along the loop to assemble time-distance diagrams, and used an exponentially decaying sine
function to fit the decaying oscillation. The initial amplitude, period, and damping time of kink
oscillation were obtained. Coronal seismology of the kink mode was applied to estimate the Alfven
speed and magnetic field strength in the oscillating loop. In addition, we measured the magnetic
field of the loop through non-linear force free field (NLFFF) modeling using the flux rope insertion
method. The oscillation is most pronounced in AIA 171 and 131. The oscillation is almost in phase
along the loop with a peak initial amplitude of 13.6 Mm, meaning that the oscillation belong to the
fast standing kink mode. The oscillation lasts for 3.5 cycles with an average period of 462 s and average
damping time of 976 s. The values of t/P lie in the range of 1.5-2.5. Based on coronal seismology, the
Alfven speed in the oscillating loop is estimated to be 1210 km. Two independent methods are applied
to calculate the magnetic field strength of the loop, resulting in 30043 G using the coronal seismology
and 21123 G using the NLFFF modeling, respectively.

The nature of circumstellar envelopes (CSE) around Cepheids is still a matter of debate. The physical
origin of their infrared (IR) excess could be either a shell of ionized gas, or a dust envelope, or
both. This study aims at constraining the geometry and the IR excess of the environment of the long-period
Cepheid $\ell$ Car (P=35.5 days) at mid-IR wavelengths to understand its physical nature. We first
use photometric observations in various bands and Spitzer Space Telescope spectroscopy to constrain
the IR excess of $\ell$ Car. Then, we analyze the VLTI/MATISSE measurements at a specific phase of
observation, in order to determine the flux contribution, the size and shape of the environment
of the star in the L band. We finally test the hypothesis of a shell of ionized gas in order to model the
IR excess. We report the first detection in the L band of a centro-symmetric extended emission around
l Car, of about 1.7$R_\star$ in FWHM, producing an excess of about 7.0\% in this band. In the N band,
there is no clear evidence for dust emission from VLTI/MATISSE correlated flux and Spitzer data.
On the other side, the modeled shell of ionized gas implies a more compact CSE ($1.13\pm0.02\,R_\star$)
and fainter (IR excess of 1\% in the L band). We provide new evidences for a compact CSE of $\ell$ Car
and we demonstrate the capabilities of VLTI/MATISSE for determining common properties of CSEs.
While the compact CSE of $\ell$ Car is probably of gaseous nature, the tested model of a shell of ionized
gas is not able to simultaneously reproduce the IR excess and the interferometric observations.
Further Galactic Cepheids observations with VLTI/MATISSE are necessary for determining the properties
of CSEs, which may also depend on both the pulsation period and the evolutionary state of the stars.

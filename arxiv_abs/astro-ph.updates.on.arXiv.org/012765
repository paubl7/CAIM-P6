(Abridged:) It has been hypothesized that the location of Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) within the
empirical relation between the inner disk radius (r$_{in}$), inferred from K-band interferometry,
and the stellar luminosity (L$_*$), is related to the presence of the innermost gas, the disk-to-star
accretion mechanism, the dust disk properties inferred from the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs), or a combination of these effects. This work aims to test whether the previously proposed
hypotheses do, in fact, serve as a general explanation for the distribution of HAeBes in the size-luminosity
diagram. GRAVITY/VLTI spectro-interferometric observations at $\sim $2.2 $ \mu$m have been obtained
for five HBes representing two extreme cases concerning the presence of innermost gas and accretion
modes. V590 Mon, PDS 281, and HD 94509 show no excess in the near-ultraviolet, Balmer region of the
spectra ($\Delta$D$_B$), indicative of a negligible amount of inner gas and disk-to-star accretion,
whereas DG Cir and HD 141926 show such strong $\Delta$D$_B$ values that cannot be reproduced from
magnetospheric accretion, but probably come from the alternative boundary layer mechanism. Additional
data for these and all HAeBes resolved through K-band interferometry have been compiled from the
literature and updated using Gaia EDR3 distances, almost doubling previous samples used to analyze
the size-luminosity relation. We find no general trend linking the presence of gas inside the dust
destruction radius or the accretion mechanism with the location of HAeBes in the size-luminosity
diagram. Underlying trends are present and must be taken into account when interpreting the size-luminosity
correlation. Still, it is argued that the size-luminosity correlation is most likely to be physically
relevant in spite of the previous statistical warning concerning dependencies on distance.

The solar photosphere and the outer layer of the Sun's interior are characterized by convective
motions, which display a chaotic and turbulent character. In this work, we evaluated the pseudo-Lyapunov
exponents of the overshooting convective motions observed on the Sun's surface by using a method
employed in the literature to estimate those exponents, as well as another technique deduced from
their definition. We analyzed observations taken with state-of-the-art instruments at ground-
and space-based telescopes, and we particularly benefited from the spectro-polarimetric data
acquired with the Interferometric Bidimensional Spectrometer, the Crisp Imaging SpectroPolarimeter,
and the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager. Following previous studies in the literature, we computed
maps of four quantities which were representative of the physical properties of solar plasma in
each observation, and estimated the pseudo-Lyapunov exponents from the residuals between the
values of the quantities computed at any point in the map and the mean of values over the whole map.
In contrast to previous results reported in the literature, we found that the computed exponents
hold negative values, which are typical of a dissipative regime, for all the quantities derived
from our observations. The values of the estimated exponents increase with the spatial resolution
of the data and are almost unaffected by small concentrations of magnetic field. Finally, we showed
that similar results were also achieved by estimating the exponents from residuals between the
values at each point in maps derived from observations taken at different times. The latter estimation
technique better accounts for the definition of these exponents than the method employed in previous
studies.

Open Clusters (OCs) can trace with a great accuracy the evolution of the Galactic disk. The aim of
this work is to study the kinematical behavior of the OC population over time. We take advantage of
the latest age determinations of OCs to investigate the correlations of the 6D phase space coordinates
and orbital properties with age. We also investigate the rotation curve of the Milky Way traced by
OCs and we compare it to that of other observational or theoretical studies. We gathered nearly 30000
Radial Velocity (RV) measurements of OC members from both Gaia-RVS data and ground based surveys
and catalogues. We computed the weighted mean RV, Galactic velocities and orbital parameters of
1382 OCs. We investigated their distributions as a function of age, and by comparison to field stars.
We provide the largest RV catalogue available for OCs, half of it based on at least 3 members. Compared
to field stars, we note that OCs are not exactly on the same arches in the radial-azimuthal velocity
plane, while they seem to follow the same diagonal ridges in the Galactic radial distribution of
azimuthal velocities. Velocity ellipsoids in different age bins all show a clear anisotropy. The
heating rate of the OC population is similar to that of field stars for the radial and azimuthal components
but significantly lower for the vertical component. The rotation curve drawn by our sample of clusters
shows several dips, which match the wiggles derived from non-axisymmetric models of the Galaxy.
From the computation of orbits, we obtain a clear dependence of the maximum height and eccentricity
with age. Finally, the orbital characteristics of the sample of clusters as shown by the action variables,
follow the distribution of field stars. The additional age information of the clusters points towards
some (weak) age dependence of the known moving groups.

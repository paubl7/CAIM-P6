Astrophysical plasma codes are built on atomic databases. In the current atomic databases, R-matrix
electron-impact excitation data of O-like ions are limited. The accuracy of plasma diagnostics
with O-like ions depends on the availability and accuracy of the atomic data. This is particularly
relevant in the context of future observatories equipped with the next generation of high-resolution
spectrometers. To obtain level-resolved effective collision strengths of O-like ions from \ion{Ne}{III}
to \ion{Zn}{XXIII} (i.e., Ne$^{2+}$ to Zn$^{22+}$) over a wide range of temperatures. This includes
transitions up to $nl=5d$ for each ion. We also aim to assess the accuracy of the new data, as well as
their impact on solar atmosphere plasma diagnostics, compared to those available within the CHIANTI
database. A large-scale R-matrix intermediate coupling frame transformation calculations were
performed systematically for the O-like iso-electronic sequence. For each ion, 630 fine-structure
levels were included in both the configuration interaction target and close-coupling collision
expansions. The present results (energy levels, oscillator strengths, and effective collision
strengths) of selected ions across the iso-electronic sequence are compared with those in archival
databases and the literature. For selected ions across the iso-electronic sequence. We find general
agreement with the few previous R-matrix calculations of collision strengths. We illustrate the
improvements for a few solar plasma diagnostics over existing CHIANTI atomic models based on distorted
wave data. The electron-impact excitation data are archived according to the Atomic Data and Analysis
Structure (ADAS) data class adf04 and will be available in OPEN-ADAS.

The ESA Gaia astrometric mission has enabled the remarkable discovery that a large fraction of the
stars near the Solar neighbourhood appear to be debris from a single in-falling system, the so-called
Gaia-Enceladus-Sausage (GSE). One exciting feature of this result is that it gives astronomers
for the first time a large sample of easily observable unevolved stars that formed in an extra-Galactic
environment, which can be compared to stars that formed within our Milky Way. Here we use these stars
to investigate the "Spite Plateau" -- the near-constant lithium abundance observed in metal-poor
dwarf stars across a wide range of metallicities (-3<[Fe/H]<-1). In particular our aim is to test
whether the stars that formed in the GSE show a different Spite Plateau to other Milky Way stars that
inhabit the disk and halo. Individual galaxies could have different Spite Plateaus -- e.g., the
ISM could be more depleted in lithium in a lower galactic mass system due to it having a smaller reservoir
of gas. We identified 76 GSE dwarf stars observed and analyzed by the GALactic Archeology with HERMES
(GALAH) survey as part of its Third Data Release. Orbital actions were used to select samples of Gaia-Enceladus
stars, and comparison samples of halo and disk stars. We find that the Gaia-Enceladus stars show
the same lithium abundance as other likely accreted stars and in situ Milky Way stars, strongly suggesting
that the "lithium problem" is not a consequence of the formation environment. This result fits within
the growing consensus that the Spite Plateau, and more generally the "cosmological lithium problem"
-- the observed discrepancy between the amount of lithium in warm, metal-poor dwarf stars in our
Galaxy, and the amount of lithium predicted to have been produced by Big Bang Nucleosynthesis --
is the result of lithium depletion processes within stars.

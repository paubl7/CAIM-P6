C-fractionation has been studied from a theoretical point of view with different models of time-dependent
chemistry, including both isotope-selective photodissociation and low-temperature isotopic
exchange reactions. Recent chemical models predict that the latter may lead to a depletion of $^{13}$C
in nitrile-bearing species, with $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios two times higher than the elemental
abundance ratio of 68 in the local ISM. Since the carbon isotopic ratio is commonly used to evaluate
the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratios with the double-isotope method, it is important to study C-fractionation
in detail to avoid incorrect assumptions. In this work we implemented a gas-grain chemical model
with new isotopic exchange reactions and investigated their introduction in the context of dense
and cold molecular gas. In particular, we investigated the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of HNC, HCN,
and CN using a grid of models, with temperatures and densities ranging from 10 to 50 K and 2$\times$10$^{3}$
to 2$\times$10$^{7}$ cm$^{-3}$, respectively. We suggest a possible $^{13}$C exchange through
the $^{13}$C + C$_{3}$ $\rightarrow$ $^{12}$C +$^{13}$CC$_{2}$ reaction, which does not result
in dilution, but rather in $^{13}$C enhancement, for molecules formed starting from atomic carbon.
This effect is efficient in a range of time between the formation of CO and its freeze-out on grains.
Furthermore, we show that the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios of nitriles are predicted to be a factor
0.8-1.9 different from the local value of 68 for massive star-forming regions. This result also
affects the $^{14}$N/$^{15}$N ratio: a value of 330 obtained with the double-isotope method is
predicted to be 260-1150, depending on the physical conditions. Finally, we studied the $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C
ratios by varying the cosmic-ray ionization rate: the ratios increase with it because of secondary
photons and cosmic-ray reactions.

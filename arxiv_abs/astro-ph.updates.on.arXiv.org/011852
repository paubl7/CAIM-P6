The mass accretion rate is the fundamental parameter to understand the process of mass assembly
that results in the formation of a low-mass star. This parameter has been largely studied in Classical
TTauri stars in star-forming regions with ages of 1-10Myr. However, little is known about the accretion
properties of young stellar objects (YSOs) in younger regions and early stages of star formation,
such as in the Class0/I phases. We present new NIR spectra of 17 ClassI/Flat and 35 ClassII sources
located in the young (<1Myr) NGC1333 cluster, acquired with the KMOS instrument at the VLT. Our goal
is to study whether the mass accretion rate evolves with age, as suggested by the widely adopted viscous
evolution model, by comparing the properties of the NGC1333 members with samples of older regions.
We measured the stellar parameters and accretion rates of our sample, finding a correlation between
accretion and stellar luminosity, and between mass accretion rate and stellar mass. Both correlations
are compatible within the errors with the older Lupus star-forming region, while only the latter
is consistent with results from ChamaeleonI. The ClassI sample shows larger accretion luminosities
with respect to the ClassII stars of the same cloud. However, the derived accretion rates are not
sufficiently high to build up the inferred stellar masses, assuming steady accretion during the
ClassI lifetime. This suggests that the sources are not in their main accretion phase and that most
of their mass has already been accumulated during a previous stage and/or that the accretion is an
episodic phenomenon. We show that some of the targets originally classified as Class I through Spitzer
photometry are in fact evolved or low accreting objects. This evidence can have implications for
the estimated protostellar phase lifetimes. Further observations are needed to determine if this
is a general result.

The level of star formation in elliptical galaxies is poorly constrained, due to difficulties in
quantifying the contamination of flux-based estimates of star formation from unrelated phenomena,
such as AGN and old stellar populations. We here utilise core-collapse supernovae (CCSNe) as unambiguous
tracers of recent star formation in ellipticals within a cosmic volume. We firstly isolate a sample
of 421 z < 0.2, r < 21.8 mag CCSNe from the SDSS-II Supernova Survey. We then introduce a Bayesian method
of identifying ellipticals via their colours and morphologies in a manner unbiased by redshift
and yet consistent with manual classification from Galaxy Zoo 1. We find ~ 25 % of z < 0.2 r < 20 mag galaxies
in the Stripe 82 region are ellipticals (~ 28000 galaxies). In total, 36 CCSNe are found to reside
in ellipticals. We demonstrate that such early-types contribute a non-negligible fraction of
star formation to the present-day cosmic budget, at 11.2 $\pm$ 3.1 (stat) $^{+3.0}_{-4.2}$ (sys)
%. Coupling this result with the galaxy stellar mass function of ellipticals, the mean specific
star formation rate (SSFR; $\overline{S}$) of these systems is derived. The best-fit slope is given
by log ($\overline{S}(M)$/yr) = - (0.80 $\pm$ 0.59) log ($M/10^{10.5}\rm{M}_{\odot}$) - 10.83
$\pm$ 0.18. The mean SSFR for all log ($M/\rm{M}_{\odot}$) > 10.0 ellipticals is found to be $\overline{S}
= 9.2 \pm 2.4$ (stat) $^{+2.7}_{-2.3}$ (sys) $\times 10^{-12}$ yr$^{-1}$, which is consistent
with recent estimates via SED-fitting, and is 11.8 $\pm$ 3.7 (stat) $^{+3.5}_{-2.9}$ (sys) % of
the mean SSFR level on the main sequence as also derived from CCSNe. We find the median optical spectrum
of elliptical CCSN hosts is statistically consistent with that of a control sample of ellipticals
that do not host CCSNe, implying that these SN-derived results are well-representative of the total
low-z elliptical population.

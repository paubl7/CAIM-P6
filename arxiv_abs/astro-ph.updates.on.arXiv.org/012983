We analyse the properties of the CIV broad emission line in connection with the X-ray emission of
30 bright SDSS quasars at z~3.0-3.3 with pointed XMM-Newton observations, which were selected
to test the suitability of AGN as cosmological tools. In our previous work, we found that a large fraction
(~25%) of the quasars in this sample are X-ray underluminous by factors of >3-10. As absorbing columns
of >10$^{23}$ cm$^{-2}$ can be safely ruled out, their weakness is most likely intrinsic. Here we
explore possible correlations between the UV and X-ray features of these sources to investigate
the origin of X-ray weakness. We fit their UV SDSS spectra and analyse their CIV properties (e.g.,
equivalent width, EW; line peak velocity, $\upsilon_{\rm peak}$) as a function of the X-ray photon
index and 2-10 keV flux. We confirm the trends of CIV $\upsilon_{\rm peak}$ and EW with UV luminosity
at 2500 angstrom for both X-ray weak and X-ray normal quasars, as well as the correlation between
X-ray weakness and CIV EW. In contrast to some recent work, we do not observe any clear relation between
the 2-10 keV luminosity and $\upsilon_{\rm peak}$. We find a correlation between the hard X-ray
flux and the integrated CIV flux for X-ray normal quasars, whilst X-ray weak quasars deviate from
the main trend by more than 0.5 dex. We argue that X-ray weakness might be interpreted in a starved
X-ray corona picture associated with an ongoing disc-wind phase. If the wind is ejected in the vicinity
of the black hole, the extreme-UV radiation that reaches the corona will be depleted, depriving
the corona of seeds photons and generating an X-ray weak quasar. Yet, at the largest UV luminosities
(>10$^{47}$ erg s$^{-1}$), there will still be an ample reservoir of ionising photons that can explain
the excess CIV emission observed in the X-ray weak quasars with respect to normal sources of similar
X-ray luminosities.

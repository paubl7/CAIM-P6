Context: The Sun is by far a privileged target for testing stellar models with unique precision.
A recent concern appeared with the progress in the solar surface abundances derivation that has
led to a decrease of the solar metallicity. While the ancient high-metallicity models were in fair
agreement with other solar observational indicators, it is no longer the case for low-metallicity
models. Recent collection of data are however promising to shed a new light on it. For instance, the
Borexino collaboration released in 2020 the first-ever complete estimate of neutrinos emitted
in the CNO cycle. It has reaffirmed the role of the neutrino constraints in the solar modelling process
and its associated issues. In parallel, newly claimed detection of solar gravity modes of oscillations
offers another opportunity of probing the stratification in the Sun's central layers. Aims: We
propose to combine the diagnoses from neutrinos and helioseismology, both from pressure and gravity
modes, for assessing the predictions of solar models. We compare in detail the different physical
prescriptions currently at disposal for stellar model computations. Results: The CNO neutrino
flux confirms a preference for high-metallicity models. Nevertheless, we found that mild modification
of the nuclear screening factors can re-match low-metallicity model predictions to observed fluxes,
although it does not restore the agreement with the helioseismic frequency ratios. Neither the
high-metallicity or low-metallicity models are able to reproduce the gravity-mode period spacing.
The disagreement is huge, more than 100$\sigma$ to the reported value. Reversely, the family of
standard models narrows the expected range of the Sun's period spacing: between $\sim$2150 to $\sim$2190~s.
Moreover, we show this indicator can constrain the chemical mixture, opacity, and to a lower extent
nuclear reactions in solar models.

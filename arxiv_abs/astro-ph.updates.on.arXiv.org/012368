The emergence of novel differential rotation laws that can reproduce the rotational profile of
binary neutron star merger remnants has opened the way for the construction of equilibrium models
with properties that resemble those of remnants in numerical simulations. We construct models
of merger remnants, using the 4-parameter differential rotation law by Uryu et al. (2017) and three
tabulated, zero-temperature equations of state. The models have angular momenta that are determined
by empirical relations, constructed through numerical simulations. After a systematic exploration
of the parameter space of merger remnant equilibrium sequences, which includes the determination
of turning points along constant-angular-momentum sequences, we find that a particular rotation
law can reproduce the threshold mass to prompt collapse to a black hole with a relative difference
of only 1% with respect to numerical simulations, in all cases considered. Furthermore, our results
indicate a possible correlation between the compactness of equilibrium models of remnants at the
threshold mass and the compactness of maximum-mass nonrotating models. Another key prediction
of binary neutron star merger simulations is a relatively slowly rotating inner region, where the
angular velocity $\Omega$ (as measured by an observer at infinity) is mostly due to the frame dragging
angular velocity $\omega$. In our investigation of the parameter space of the Uryu+ rotation law,
we naturally find quasi-spherical (Type A) remnant models with this property. Our investigation
clarifies the impact of the differential rotation law and of the equation of state on key properties
of binary neutron star remnants and lays the groundwork for including thermal effects in future
studies.

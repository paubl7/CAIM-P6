We present Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) telescope observations of the radio-loud gravitational
lens systems MG 0751+2716 and CLASS B1600+434. These observations produce images at 300 milliarcseconds
(mas) resolution at 150 MHz. In the case of MG 0751+2716, lens modelling is used to derive a size estimate
of around 2 kpc for the low-frequency source, which is consistent with a previous 27.4 GHz study in
the radio continuum with Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA). This consistency implies that the
low-frequency radio source is cospatial with the core-jet structure that forms the radio structure
at higher frequencies, and no significant lobe emission or further components associated with
star formation are detected within the magnified region of the lens. CLASS B1600+434 is a two-image
lens where one of the images passes through the edge-on spiral lensing galaxy, and the low radio frequency
allows us to derive limits on propagation effects, namely scattering, in the lensing galaxy. The
observed flux density ratio of the two lensed images is 1.19 +/- 0.04 at an observed frequency of 150
MHz. The widths of the two images give an upper limit of 0.035 kpc m^-20/3 on the integrated scattering
column through the galaxy at a distance approximately 1 kpc above its plane, under the assumption
that image A is not affected by scattering. This is relatively small compared to limits derived through
very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) studies of differential scattering in lens systems.
These observations demonstrate that LOFAR is an excellent instrument for studying gravitational
lenses. We also report on the inability to calibrate three further lens observations: two from early
observations that have less well determined station calibration, and a third observation impacted
by phase transfer problems.

Las Cumbres Observatory (LCO) has deployed a network of ten identical 1-m telescopes to four locations.
The global coverage and flexibility of the LCO network makes it ideal for discovery, follow-up,
and characterization of all Solar System objects, and especially Near-Earth Objects (NEOs). We
describe the "LCO NEO Follow-up Network" which makes use of the LCO network of robotic telescopes
and an online, cloud-based web portal, NEOexchange, to perform photometric characterization
and spectroscopic classification of NEOs and follow-up astrometry for both confirmed NEOs and
unconfirmed NEO candidates. The follow-up astrometric, photometric, and spectroscopic characterization
efforts are focused on those NEO targets that are due to be observed by the planetary radar facilities
and those on the NHATS lists. Astrometry allows us to improve target orbits, making radar observations
possible for objects with a short arc or large orbital uncertainty and also allows for the detection
and measurement of the Yarkovsky effect on NEOs. Photometric & spectroscopic data allows us to determine
the light curve shape and amplitude, measure rotation periods, determine the taxonomic classification,
and improve the overall characterization of these targets. We describe the NEOexchange follow-up
portal and the methodology adopted which allows the software to be packaged and deployed anywhere,
including in off-site cloud services. This allows professionals, amateurs, and citizen scientists
to plan, schedule and analyze NEO imaging and spectroscopy data using the LCO network and acts as
a coordination hub for the NEO follow-up efforts. We illustrate these capabilities with examples
of first period determinations for radar-targeted NEOs and its use to plan and execute multi-site
photometric and spectroscopic observations of (66391) 1999 KW4, the subject of the most recent
planetary defense exercise campaign.

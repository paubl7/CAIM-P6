Intensity scintillations of radio pulsars are known to originate from interference between waves
scattered by the electron density irregularities of interstellar plasma, often leading to parabolic
arcs in the two-dimensional power spectrum of the recorded dynamic spectrum. The degree of arc curvature
depends on the distance to the scattering plasma and its transverse velocity with respect to the
line-of-sight. We report the observation of annual and orbital variations in the curvature of scintillation
arcs over a period of 16 years for the bright millisecond pulsar, PSR J0437-4715. These variations
are the signature of the relative transverse motions of the Earth, pulsar, and scattering medium,
which we model to obtain precise measurements of parameters of the pulsar's binary orbit and the
scattering medium itself. We observe two clear scintillation arcs in most of our $>$5000 observations
and we show that they originate from scattering by thin screens located at distances $D_1 = 89.8 \pm
0.4$ pc and $D_2 = 124 \pm 3$ pc from Earth. The best-fit scattering model we derive for the brightest
arc yields the pulsar's orbital inclination angle $i = 137.1 \pm 0.3^\circ$, and longitude of ascending
node, $\Omega=206.3\pm0.4^\circ$. Using scintillation arcs for precise astrometry and orbital
dynamics can be superior to modelling variations in the diffractive scintillation timescale,
because the arc curvature is independent of variations in the level of turbulence of interstellar
plasma. This technique can be used in combination with pulsar timing to determine the full three-dimensional
orbital geometries of binary pulsars, and provides parameters essential for testing theories
of gravity and constraining neutron star masses.

We present observations of two bright M dwarfs (TOI-1634 and TOI-1685: $J=9.5-9.6$) hosting ultra-short
period (USP) planet candidates, identified by the TESS mission. The two stars are similar in temperature,
mass, and radius, and the planet candidates are both super-Earth-sized ($1.25\,R_\oplus<R_p<2.0\,R_\oplus$).
For both systems, light curves from the ground-based photometry exhibit planetary transits, whose
depths are consistent with those by the TESS photometry. We also refine the transit ephemerides
based on the ground-based photometry, finding the orbital periods of $P=0.9893457 \pm 0.0000034$
day and $P=0.6691425 \pm 0.0000037$ day for TOI-1634b and TOI-1685b, respectively. Through intensive
radial velocity (RV) observations using the IRD spectrograph on the Subaru 8.2m telescope, we confirm
the planetary nature of the TOIs, and measure their masses: $9.94\pm0.94\,M_\oplus$ and $3.84\pm0.96\,M_\oplus$
for TOI-1634b and TOI-1685b, respectively, when the observed RVs are fitted with a single-planet
circular-orbit model. Combining those with the planet radii of $R_p=1.773\pm 0.077\,R_\oplus$
(TOI-1634b) and $1.463\pm0.065\,R_\oplus$ (TOI-1685b), we find that both USP planets have mean
densities consistent with an Earth-like internal composition, which is typical for small USP planets.
TOI-1634b is currently the most massive USP planet in this category, and it resides near the radius
valley, which makes it a benchmark planet in the context of testing the formation scenarios for USP
planets. Excess scatter in the RV residuals for TOI-1685 suggests the presence of a possible secondary
planet or unknown activity/instrumental noise in the RV data, but further observations are required
to check those possibilities.

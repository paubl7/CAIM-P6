The estimate of stellar metallicities (Z*) of high-z galaxies are of paramount importance in order
to understand the complexity of dust effects and the reciprocal interrelations among stellar mass,
dust attenuation, stellar age, and metallicity. Benefiting from uniquely deep FUV spectra of >500
star-forming galaxies at redshifts 2<z<5 extracted from the VANDELS survey and stacked in bins
of stellar mass (M*) and UV continuum slope (beta), we estimate their stellar metallicities Z* from
stellar photospheric absorption features at 1501 and 1719 Angstrom, which are calibrated with
Starburst99 models and are largely unaffected by stellar age, dust, IMF, nebular continuum or interstellar
absorption. Comparing them to photometric based spectral slopes in the range 1250-1750 Angstrom,
we find that the stellar metallicity increases by ~0.5 dex from beta ~ -2 to beta ~ -1 (1 < A(1600) < 3.2),
and a dependence with beta holds at fixed UV absolute luminosity M(UV) and stellar mass up to 10^(9.65)
Msun. As a result, the metallicity is a fundamental ingredient for properly rescaling dust corrections
based on M(UV) and M*. Using the same absorption features, we analyze the mass-metallicity relation
(MZR) and find it is consistent with the previous VANDELS estimation based on a global fit of the FUV
spectra. Similarly, we do not find a significant evolution between z=2 and z=3.5. Finally, the slopes
of our MZR and Z*-beta relation are in agreement with the predictions of well-studied semi-analytic
models of galaxy formation (SAM), while some tensions with observations remain as to the absolute
metallicity normalization. The relation between UV slope and stellar metallicity is fundamental
for the exploitation of large volume surveys with next-generation telescopes and for the physical
characterization of galaxies in the first billion years of our Universe.

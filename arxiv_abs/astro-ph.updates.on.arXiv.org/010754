Context. The derived physical parameters for young HII regions are normally determined assuming
the emission region to be optically-thin. However, this is unlikely to hold for young HII regions
such as Hyper-compact HII(HCHII) and Ultra-compact HII(UCHII) regions and leads to the underestimation
of their properties. This can be overcome by fitting the SEDs over a wide range of radio frequencies.
Aims. Two primary goals are (1) determining physical properties from radio SEDs and finding potential
HCHII regions; (2) using these physical properties to investigate their evolution. Method. We
used Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to make observations of X-band and K-band with angular-resolutions
of ~1.7" and ~0.7", respectively, toward 114 HII regions with rising-spectra between 1-5 GHz. We
complement our observations with VLA archival data and construct SEDs between 1-26 GHz and model
them assuming an ionisation-bounded HII region with uniform density. Results. The sample has a
mean electron density of ne=1.6E4cm^{-3}, diameter diam=0.14pc, and emission measure EM = 1.9E7pc*cm^{-6}.
We identify 16 HCHII region candidates and 8 intermediate objects between the classes of HCHII and
UCHII regions. The ne, diam, and EM change as expected, however, the Lyman continuum flux is relatively
constant over time. We find that about 67% of Lyman continuum photons are absorbed by dust within
these HII regions and the dust absorption fraction tends to be more significant for more compact
and younger HII regions. Conclusion. Young HII regions are commonly located in dusty clumps; HCHII
regions and intermediate objects are often associated with various masers, outflows, broad radio
recombination lines, and extended green objects, and the accretion at the two stages tends to be
quickly reduced or halted.

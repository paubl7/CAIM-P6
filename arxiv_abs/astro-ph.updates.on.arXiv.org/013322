Intense X-ray and ultraviolet stellar irradiation can heat and inflate the atmospheres of closely
orbiting exoplanets, driving mass outflows that may be significant enough to evaporate a sizable
fraction of the planet atmosphere over the system lifetime. The recent surge in the number of known
exoplanets, together with the imminent deployment of new ground and space-based facilities for
exoplanet discovery and characterization, requires a prompt and efficient assessment of the most
promising targets for intensive spectroscopic follow-ups. To this purpose, we developed ATES
(ATmospheric EScape); a new hydrodynamics code that is specifically designed to compute the temperature,
density, velocity and ionization fraction profiles of highly irradiated planetary atmospheres,
along with the current, steady-state mass loss rate. ATES solves the one-dimensional Euler, mass
and energy conservation equations in radial coordinates through a finite-volume scheme. The hydrodynamics
module is paired with a photoionization equilibrium solver that includes cooling via bremsstrahlung,
recombination and collisional excitation/ionization for the case of a primordial atmosphere
entirely composed of atomic hydrogen and helium, whilst also accounting for advection of the different
ion species. Compared against the results of 14 moderately-to-highly irradiated planets simulated
with The PLUTO-CLOUDY Interface (TPCI), ATES yields remarkably good agreement at a significantly
smaller fraction of the computational time. A convergence study shows that ATES recovers stable,
steady-state hydrodynamic solutions for systems with $\log(-\phi_p) \lesssim 12.9 + 0.17\log
F_{\rm XUV}$. Incidentally, atmospheres of systems above this threshold are generally thought
to be undergoing Jeans escape. The code, which also features a user-friendly graphic interface,
is available publicly as an online repository.

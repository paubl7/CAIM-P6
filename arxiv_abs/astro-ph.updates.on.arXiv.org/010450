We study the implications of a combined analysis of cosmic standard candles and standard rulers
on the viability of cosmological models beyond the cosmological concordance model. To this end,
we employ well-established data in the form of the joint light-curve analysis supernova compilation,
baryon acoustic oscillations, and cosmic microwave background data on the one hand, and a recently
proposed set of quasars as objects of known brightness on the other hand. The advantage of including
the latter is that they extend the local distance measures to redshifts which have previously been
out of reach and we investigate how this allows one to test cosmologies beyond $\Lambda$CDM. While
there exist various studies on parametric extensions of $\Lambda$CDM, we present here a comparative
study of both parametric and fundamental extensions of the standard cosmology. In order to keep
the scope of this manuscript contained, we focus on two particular modifications: One is the consistent
theory of two interacting spin-2 objects, so-called bigravity, and the other conformal gravity,
a theory of gravity that has no knowledge of fundamental length scales. The former of the two constitutes
a veritable extension of General Relativity, given that it adds to the metric tensor of gravity a
second dynamical tensor field. The resulting dynamics have been proposed as a self-accelerating
cosmology. Conformal gravity on the other hand is a much more drastic change of the underlying gravitational
theory. Its ignorance towards fundamental length scales offers a completely different approach
to the origin of late time acceleration. In this sense, both models offer - in one way or another - an
explanation for the dark energy problem. We perform a combined cosmological fit which provides
strong constraints on these extensions. We also briefly comment on the implications of the long-standing
$H_0$-tension.

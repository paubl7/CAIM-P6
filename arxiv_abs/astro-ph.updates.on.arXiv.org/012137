We investigated the dependence of the parameters of the segments of spiral arms of the Galaxy on the
age of classical Cepheids. The catalog of Cepheids (Mel'nik et al. 2015) was divided into two samples$-$relatively
young ($P>9^\text{d}$) and relatively old ($P<9^\text{d}$) objects. The parameters of the spiral
structure were determined both for two samples separately and jointly for the combination of two
systems of segments traced by young and old objects. For most of the segments, their parameters for
young and old objects differ significantly. Taking into account the difference between the two
segment systems, we obtained the estimate $R_0$ equal to $7.23^{+0.19}_{-0.18}$ kpc, which in
the modern LMC calibration corresponds to the value of $R_0={8.08^{+0.21}_{-0.20}}|_{\text{stat.}}
{}^{+0.38}_{-0.36}|_{\text{cal.}}$ kpc. It is shown that the displacement between the segments
is not reduced to the effect of differential rotation only. To interpret this displacement for objects
of Perseus and Sagittarius-2 segments we carried out a dynamic modeling of the change in the position
of the segment points when moving in the smooth gravitational field of the Galaxy. At the angular
velocity of rotation of the spiral pattern $\Omega_{\text{p}} = 25.2 \pm 0.5$ km s$^{-1}$ kpc$^{-1}$
(Dambis et al. 2015) the observed displacement between segments on young and old objects can be explained
by the amplitude of spiral perturbations of the radial velocity of $u = 10 \pm1.5$ km s$^{-1}$. For
the constructed double system of spiral segments, it is demonstrated that the assumption of constancy
of the pitch angles within each segment and the assumption that the pole of the spiral pattern is in
the direction of the nominal center of the Galaxy do not contradict the data within the range of uncertainty.

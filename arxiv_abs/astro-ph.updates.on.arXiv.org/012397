In this article, we investigate the formation and disruption of a coronal sigmoid from the active
region (AR) NOAA 11909 on 07 December 2013, by analyzing multi-wavelength and multi-instrument
observations. Our analysis suggests that the formation of `transient' sigmoid initiated $\approx$1
hour before its eruption through a coupling between two twisted coronal loop systems. A comparison
between coronal and photospheric images suggests that the coronal sigmoid was formed over a simple
$\beta$-type AR which also possessed dispersed magnetic field structure in the photosphere. The
line-of-sight photospheric magnetograms also reveal moving magnetic features, small-scale
flux cancellation events near the PIL, and overall flux cancellation during the extended pre-eruption
phase which suggest the role of tether-cutting reconnection toward the build-up of the flux rope.
The disruption of the sigmoid proceeded with a two-ribbon eruptive M1.2 flare (SOL2013-12-07T07:29).
In radio frequencies, we observe type III and type II bursts in meter wavelengths during the impulsive
phase of the flare. The successful eruption of the flux rope leads to a fast coronal mass ejection
(with a linear speed of $\approx$1085 km s -1 ) in SOHO/LASCO field-of-view. During the evolution
of the flare, we clearly observe typical "sigmoid-to-arcade" transformation. Prior to the onset
of the impulsive phase of the flare, flux rope undergoes a slow rise ($\approx$15 km s -1 ) which subsequently
transitions into a fast eruption ($\approx$110 km s -1 ). The two-phase evolution of the flux rope
shows temporal associations with the soft X-ray precursor and impulsive phase emissions of the
M-class flare, respectively, thus pointing toward a feedback relationship between magnetic reconnection
and early CME dynamics.

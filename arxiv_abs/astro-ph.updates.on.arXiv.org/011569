The presence of relativistic electrons within the diffuse gas phase of galaxy clusters is now well
established, but their detailed origin remains unclear. Cosmic ray protons are also expected to
accumulate during the formation of clusters and would lead to gamma-ray emission through hadronic
interactions within the thermal gas. Recently, the detection of gamma-ray emission has been reported
toward the Coma cluster with Fermi-LAT. Assuming that this gamma-ray emission arises from hadronic
interactions in the ICM, we aim at exploring the implication of this signal on the cosmic ray content
of the Coma cluster. We use the MINOT software to build a physical model of the cluster and apply it
to the Fermi-LAT data. We also consider contamination from compact sources and the impact of various
systematic effects. We confirm that a significant gamma-ray signal is observed within the characteristic
radius $\theta_{500}$ of the Coma cluster, with a test statistic TS~27 for our baseline model. The
presence of a possible point source may account for most of the observed signal. However, this source
could also correspond to the peak of the diffuse emission of the cluster itself and extended models
match the data better. We constrain the cosmic ray to thermal energy ratio within $R_{500}$ to $X_{\rm
CRp}=1.79^{+1.11}_{-0.30}$\% and the slope of the energy spectrum of cosmic rays to $\alpha=2.80^{+0.67}_{-0.13}$.
Finally, we compute the synchrotron emission associated with the secondary electrons produced
in hadronic interactions assuming steady state. This emission is about four times lower than the
overall observed radio signal, so that primary cosmic ray electrons or reacceleration of secondary
electrons is necessary to explain the total emission. Assuming an hadronic origin of the signal,
our results provide the first quantitative measurement of the cosmic ray proton content in a cluster.[Abridged]

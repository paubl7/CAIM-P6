The detection of Earth-mass exoplanets in the habitable zone around solar-mass stars using the
radial velocity technique requires extremely high precision, on the order of 10$\,$cm$\,$s$^{-1}$,
below the intrinsic variability of even relatively inactive stars, such as the Sun. One such variable
is convective blueshift varying temporally, spatially, and between spectral lines. We develop
a new approach for measuring convective blueshift and determine the strength of convective blueshift
for 810 stars observed by the HARPS spectrograph, spanning spectral types late-F, G, K, and early-M.
We derive a model for infering blueshift velocity for lines of any depth in later-type stars of any
effective temperature. Using a custom list of spectral lines, covering a wide range of absorption
depths, we create a model for the line-core shift as a function of line depth, commonly known as the
third signature of granulation. We utilize an extremely-high-resolution solar spectrum (R$\sim$1$\,$000$\,$000)
to empirically account for the nonlinear nature of the third signature. The solar third signature
is then scaled to all 810 stars. Through this we obtain a measure of the convective blueshift relative
to the Sun as a function of stellar effective temperature. We confirm the general correlation of
increasing convective blueshift with effective temperature and establish a tight, cubic relation
between the two that strongly increases for stars above $\sim$5800$\,$K. For stars between $\sim$4100$\,$K
and $\sim$4700$\,$K we show, for the first time, a plateau in convective shift and a possible onset
of a plateau for stars above 6000$\,$K. Stars below $\sim$4000$\,$K show neither blueshift nor
redshift. We provide a table that lists expected blueshift velocities for each spectral subtype
in the data set to quickly access the intrinsic noise floor through convective blueshift for the
radial velocity technique.

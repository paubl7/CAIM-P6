We analyze the galaxy pairs in a volume limited sample ($M_r \leq -21$) from the SDSS to study the effects
of galaxy interactions on the star formation rate and colour of galaxies in different environments.
We study the star formation rate and colour of the paired galaxies as a function of projected separation
and compare the results with their control samples matched in stellar mass, redshift and local density.
We find that the major interactions significantly enhance the star formation rate in paired galaxies
and turn them bluer with decreasing pair separation within $30$ kpc. The impact of tidal interactions
on star formation rate and colour are more significant in the heavier members of the major pairs.
The star formation enhancement in major pairs is significantly higher at the low-density environments,
where the influence can extend up to $\sim 100$ kpc. Contrarily, the major pairs at high-density
environments show suppression in their star formation. Depending on the embedding environments,
the major interactions in the intrinsically brighter galaxy pairs can thus enhance or quench star
formation. We find that the minor pairs at both low-density and high-density environments are significantly
less star-forming and redder than their control galaxies. It indicates that the minor interactions
in intrinsically brighter galaxy pairs always suppress the star formation irrespective of their
environment. The lighter members in these minor pairs show a greater susceptibility to suppressed
star formation. Our results imply that both the major and minor interactions can contribute to the
observed bimodality. We conclude that the galaxy evolution is determined by a complex interplay
between the galaxy properties, galaxy interactions, and environment.

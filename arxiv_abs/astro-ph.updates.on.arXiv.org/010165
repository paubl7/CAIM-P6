High resolution spectropolarimetric observations of the strongly magnetic, super-slowly rotating
rapidly oscillating Ap star HD166473 are used to investigate the implications of the presence of
a variable strong magnetic field on the vertical and surface horizontal distribution of various
chemical elements. The analysis of the calculated LSD Stokes $I$ and $V$ profiles confirms the previously
reported detection of non-uniform horizontal surface distribution of several chemical elements.
To test the vertical abundance stratification of iron peak and rare earth elements, magnetic field
measurements were carried out using spectral lines of these elements belonging to neutral and ionised
stages. We find clear indication of the existence of a relation between the magnetic field strength
and its orientation and vertical element stratification: magnetic field values obtained for elements
in different stages close to the magnetic equator are rather similar whereas the dispersion in field
strengths is remarkably large in the regions close to magnetic field poles. At the phases of negative
and positive extrema the mean longitudinal field strength determined from the analysis of the REE
lines is usually stronger than when using Fe and Cr. The strongest mean longitudinal magnetic field,
up to $-$4160$\pm$226 G, is detected using the La II line list at the negative extremum, followed
by the measurements using the Pr III lines with $\langle B_z \rangle$=$-$3740$\pm$343 G and the
Ce II lines with $\langle B_z \rangle$=$-$3372$\pm$247 G. The strongest mean longitudinal magnetic
field of positive polarity, up to 3584$\pm$354 G is detected using the Pr III lines, followed by the
measurement $\langle B_z \rangle$=2517$\pm$249 G using the Ce II lines.

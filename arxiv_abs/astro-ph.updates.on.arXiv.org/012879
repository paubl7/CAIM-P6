We use the data-driven method, The Cannon, to bring 21,000 stars from the ARGOS bulge survey, including
10,000 red clump stars, onto the parameter and abundance scales of the cross-Galactic survey, APOGEE,
obtaining rms precisions of 0.10 dex, 0.07 dex, 74 K, and 0.18 dex for [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], Teff, and log(g),
respectively. The re-calibrated ARGOS survey - which we refer to as the A2A survey - is combined with
the APOGEE survey to investigate the abundance structure of the Galactic bulge. We find X-shaped
[Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] distributions in the bulge that are more pinched than the bulge density, a signature
of its disk origin. The mean abundance along the major axis of the bar varies such that the stars are
more [Fe/H]-poor and [Mg/Fe]-rich near the Galactic center than in the long bar/outer bulge region.
The vertical [Fe/H] and [Mg/Fe] gradients vary between the inner bulge and long bar with the inner
bulge showing a flattening near the plane that is absent in the long bar. The [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] distribution
shows two main maxima, an ``[Fe/H]-poor [Mg/Fe]- rich'' maximum and an ``[Fe/H]-rich [Mg/Fe]-poor''
maximum, that vary in strength with position in the bulge. In particular, the outer long bar close
to the Galactic plane is dominated by super-solar [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe]-normal stars. Stars composing
the [Fe/H]-rich maximum show little kinematic dependence on [Fe/H], but for lower [Fe/H] the rotation
and dispersion of the bulge increase slowly. Stars with [Fe/H]<-1 dex have a very different kinematic
structure than stars with higher [Fe/H]. Comparing with recent models for the Galactic boxy-peanut
bulge, the abundance gradients and distribution, and the relation between [Fe/H] and kinematics
suggest that the stars comprising each maximum have separate disk origins with the ``[Fe/H]-poor
[Mg/Fe]-rich'' stars originating from a thicker disk than the ``[Fe/H]-rich [Mg/Fe]-poor'' stars.

Point source spectrophotometric ("single-point") light curves of Earth-like planets contain
a surprising amount of information about the spatial features of those worlds. Spatially resolving
these light curves is important for assessing time-varying surface features and the existence
of an atmosphere, which in turn is critical to life on Earth and significant for determining habitability
on exoplanets. Given that Earth is the only celestial body confirmed to harbor life, treating it
as a proxy exoplanet by analyzing time-resolved spectral images provides a benchmark in the search
for habitable exoplanets. The Earth Polychromatic Imaging Camera (EPIC) on the Deep Space Climate
Observatory (DSCOVR) provides such an opportunity, with observations of ~5000 full-disk sunlit
Earth images each year at ten wavelengths with high temporal frequency. We disk-integrate these
spectral images to create single-point light curves and decompose them into principal components
(PCs). Using machine learning techniques to relate the PCs to six preselected spatial features,
we find that the first and fourth PCs of the single-point light curves, contributing ~83.23% of the
light curve variability, contain information about low and high clouds, respectively. Surface
information relevant to the contrast between land and ocean reflectance is contained in the second
PC, while individual land sub-types are not easily distinguishable (<0.1% total light curve variation).
We build an Earth model by systematically altering the spatial features to derive causal relationships
to the PCs. This model can serve as a baseline for analyzing Earth-like exoplanets and guide wavelength
selection and sampling strategies for future observations.

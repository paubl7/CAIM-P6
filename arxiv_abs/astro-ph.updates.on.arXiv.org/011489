We report results of a search for an isotropic gravitational-wave background (GWB) using data from
Advanced LIGO's and Advanced Virgo's third observing run (O3) combined with upper limits from the
earlier O1 and O2 runs. Unlike in previous observing runs in the advanced detector era, we include
Virgo in the search for the GWB. The results are consistent with uncorrelated noise, and therefore
we place upper limits on the strength of the GWB. We find that the dimensionless energy density $\Omega_{\rm
GW}\leq 5.8\times 10^{-9}$ at the 95% credible level for a flat (frequency-independent) GWB, using
a prior which is uniform in the log of the strength of the GWB, with 99% of the sensitivity coming from
the band 20-76.6 Hz; $\leq 3.4 \times 10^{-9}$ at 25 Hz for a power-law GWB with a spectral index of
2/3 (consistent with expectations for compact binary coalescences), in the band 20-90.6 Hz; and
$\leq 3.9 \times 10^{-10}$ at 25 Hz for a spectral index of 3, in the band 20-291.6 Hz. These upper limits
improve over our previous results by a factor of 6.0 for a flat GWB. We also search for a GWB arising
from scalar and vector modes, which are predicted by alternative theories of gravity; we place upper
limits on the strength of GWBs with these polarizations. We demonstrate that there is no evidence
of correlated noise of magnetic origin by performing a Bayesian analysis that allows for the presence
of both a GWB and an effective magnetic background arising from geophysical Schumann resonances.
We compare our upper limits to a fiducial model for the GWB from the merger of compact binaries. Finally,
we combine our results with observations of individual mergers andshow that, at design sensitivity,
this joint approach may yield stronger constraints on the merger rate of binary black holes at $z
\lesssim 2$ than can be achieved with individually resolved mergers alone. [abridged]

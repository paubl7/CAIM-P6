We present an analysis of UV spectra of 13 quasars believed to belong to extreme Population A (xA)
quasars, aimed at the estimation of the chemical abundances of the broad line emitting gas. Metallicity
estimates for the broad line emitting gas of quasars are subject to a number of caveats, although
present data suggest the possibility of an increase along the quasar main sequence along with prominence
of optical Fe II emission. Extreme Population A sources with the strongest Fe II emission offer several
advantages with respect to the quasar general population, as their optical and UV emission lines
can be interpreted as the sum of a low-ionization component roughly at quasar rest frame (from virialized
gas), plus a blueshifted excess (a disk wind), in different physical conditions. Specifically,
in terms of ionization parameter, cloud density, metallicity and column density. Capitalizing
on these results, we analyze the component at rest frame and the blueshifted one, exploiting the
dependence (of several intensity line ratios on metallicity $Z$). We find that the validity of intensity
line ratios as metallicity indicators depends on the physical conditions. We apply the measured
diagnostic ratios to estimate the physical properties of sources such as density, ionization,
and metallicity of the gas. Our results confirm that the two regions (the low-ionization component
and the blue-shifted excess) of different dynamical conditions also show different physical conditions
and suggest metallicity values that are high, and probably the highest along the quasar main sequence,
with $Z \gtrsim 10 Z_{\odot}$. We found some evidence of an overabundance of Aluminium with respect
to Carbon, possibly due to selective enrichment of the broad line emitting gas by supernova ejecta.

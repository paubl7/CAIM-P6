Both observations and numerical simulations suggest that Alfvenic waves may carry sufficient
energy to sustain the hot temperatures of the solar atmospheric plasma. However, the thermalization
of wave energy is inefficient unless very short spatial scales are considered. Phase mixing is a
mechanism that can take energy down to dissipation lengths, but it operates over too long a timescale.
Here, we study how turbulence, driven by the nonlinear evolution of phase-mixed torsional Alfven
waves in coronal loops, is able to take wave energy down to the dissipative scales much faster than
the theory of linear phase mixing predicts. We consider a simple model of a transversely nonuniform
cylindrical flux tube with a constant axial magnetic field. The flux tube is perturbed by the fundamental
mode of standing torsional Alfven waves. We solved the three-dimensional (3D) ideal magnetohydrodynamics
equations numerically to study the temporal evolution. Initially, torsional Alfven waves undergo
the process of phase mixing because of the transverse variation of density. After only few periods
of torsional waves, azimuthal shear flows generated by phase mixing eventually trigger the Kelvin-Helmholtz
instability (KHi), and the flux tube is subsequently driven to a turbulent state. Turbulence is
very anisotropic and develops transversely only to the background magnetic field. The obtained
power law for the energy cascade to small scales is compatible with theoretical predictions of nearly
2D weak Alfvenic turbulence. After the onset of turbulence, the effective Reynolds number decreases
in the flux tube much faster than in the initial linear stage governed by phase mixing alone. We conclude
that the nonlinear evolution of torsional Alfven waves, and the associated KHi, is a viable mechanism
for the onset of turbulence in coronal loops.

We study the impact of mass-transfer physics on the observable properties of binary black hole populations
formed through isolated binary evolution. We investigate the impact of mass-accretion efficiency
onto compact objects and common-envelope efficiency on the observed distributions of $\chi_{eff}$,
$M_{chirp}$ and $q$. We find that low common envelope efficiency translates to tighter orbits post
common envelope and therefore more tidally spun up second-born black holes. However, these systems
have short merger timescales and are only marginally detectable by current gravitational-waves
detectors as they form and merge at high redshifts ($z\sim 2$), outside current detector horizons.
Assuming Eddington-limited accretion efficiency and that the first-born black hole is formed
with a negligible spin, we find that all non-zero $\chi_{eff}$ systems in the detectable population
can come only from the common envelope channel as the stable mass-transfer channel cannot shrink
the orbits enough for efficient tidal spin-up to take place. We find the local rate density ($z\simeq
0.01$) for the common envelope channel is in the range $\sim 17-113~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$ considering
a range of $\alpha_{CE} \in [0.2,5.0]$ while for the stable mass transfer channel the rate density
is $\sim 25~Gpc^{-3}yr^{-1}$. The latter drops by two orders of magnitude if the mass accretion
onto the black hole is not Eddington limited because conservative mass transfer does not shrink
the orbit as efficiently as non-conservative mass transfer does. Finally, using GWTC-2 events,
we constrain the lower bound of branching fraction from other formation channels in the detected
population to be $\sim 0.2$. Assuming all remaining events to be formed through either stable mass
transfer or common envelope channels, we find moderate to strong evidence in favour of models with
inefficient common envelopes.

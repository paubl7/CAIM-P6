We compile observations of molecular gas contents and infrared-based star formation rates (SFRs)
for 112 circumnuclear star forming regions, in order to re-investigate the form of the disk-averaged
Schmidt surface density star formation law in starbursts. We then combine these results with total
gas and SFR surface densities for 153 nearby non-starbursting disk galaxies from de los Reyes \&
Kennicutt (2019), to investigate the properties of the combined star formation law, following
Kennicutt (1998; K98). We confirm that the combined Schmidt law can be fitted with a single power
law with slope $n = 1.5\pm0.05$ (including fitting method uncertainties), somewhat steeper than
the value $n = 1.4\pm0.15$ found by K98. Fitting separate power laws to the non-starbursting and
starburst galaxies, however, produces very different slopes ($n = 1.34\pm0.07$ and $0.98\pm0.07$,
respectively), with a pronounced offset in the zeropoint ($\sim$0.6\,dex) of the starburst relation
to higher SFR surface densities. This offset is seen even when a common conversion factor between
CO intensity and molecular hydrogen surface density is applied, and is confirmed when disk surface
densities of interstellar dust are used as proxies for gas measurements. Tests for possible systematic
biases in the starburst data fail to uncover any spurious sources for such a large offset. We tentatively
conclude that the global Schmidt law in galaxies, at least as it is conventionally measured, is bimodal
or possibly multi-modal. Possible causes may include changes in the small-scale structure of the
molecular ISM or the stellar initial mass function. A single $n \sim 1.5$ power law still remains
as a credible approximation or "recipe" for analytical or numerical models of galaxy formation
and evolution.

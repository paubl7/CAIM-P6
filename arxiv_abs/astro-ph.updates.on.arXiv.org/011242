Working within the deep-MOND limit (DML), I describe spherical, self-gravitating systems governed
by a polytropic equation of state, $P=\mathcal{K}\rho^\gamma$. As self-consistent structures,
such systems can serve as heuristic models for DML, astronomical systems, such as dwarf spheroidal
galaxies, low-surface-density elliptical galaxies and star clusters, and diffuse galaxy groups.
They can also serve as testing ground for various theoretical MOND inferences. In dimensionless
form, the equation satisfied by the radial density profile $\zeta(y)$ is (for $\gamma\not=1$)
$[\int_0^y \zeta \bar y^2 d\bar y]^{1/2}=-yd(\zeta^{\gamma-1})/dy$. Or, $\theta^n(y)=y^{-2}[(y\theta')^2]'$,
where $\theta=\zeta^{\gamma-1}$, and $n\equiv (\gamma-1)^{-1}$. I discuss properties of the
solutions, contrasting them with those of their Newtonian analogues -- the Lane-Emden polytropes.
Due to the stronger MOND gravity, all DML polytropes have a finite mass, and for $n<\infty$ ($\gamma>1$)
all have a finite radius. (Lane-Emden spheres have a finite mass only for $n\le 5$.) I use the DML polytropes
to study DML scaling relations. For example, they satisfy a universal relation (for all $\mathcal{K}$
and $\gamma$) between the total mass, $M$, and the mass-average velocity dispersion $\sigma$:
$MGa_0=(9/4)\sigma^4$. However, the relation between $M$ and other measures of the velocity dispersion,
such as the central, projected one, $\bar\sigma$, does depend on $n$ (but not $\mathcal{K}$), defining
a `fundamental surface' in the $[M,~\bar\sigma,~n]$ space. I also describe the generalization
to anisotropic polytropes, which also all have a finite radius (for $\gamma>1$), and all satisfy
the above universal $M-\sigma$ relation. This more extended class of models exhibits the central-surface-densities
relation: a tight relation between the baryonic and the dynamical central surface densities predicted
by MOND.

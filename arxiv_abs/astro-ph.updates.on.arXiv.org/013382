The Polstar mission will provide for a space-borne 60cm telescope operating at UV wavelengths with
spectropolarimetric capability capturing all four Stokes parameters (intensity, two linear
polarization components, and circular polarization). Polstar's capabilities are designed to
meet its goal of determining how circumstellar gas flows alter massive stars' evolution, and finding
the consequences for the stellar remnant population and the stirring and enrichment of the interstellar
medium, by addressing four key science objectives. In addition, Polstar will determine drivers
for the alignment of the smallest interstellar grains, and probe the dust, magnetic fields, and
environments in the hot diffuse interstellar medium, including for the first time a direct measurement
of the polarized and energized properties of intergalactic dust. Polstar will also characterize
processes that lead to the assembly of exoplanetary systems and that affect exoplanetary atmospheres
and habitability. Science driven design requirements include: access to ultraviolet bands: where
hot massive stars are brightest and circumstellar opacity is highest; high spectral resolution:
accessing diagnostics of circumstellar gas flows and stellar composition in the far-UV at 122-200nm,
including the NV, SiIV, and CIV resonance doublets and other transitions such as NIV, AlIII, HeII,
and CIII; polarimetry: accessing diagnostics of circumstellar magnetic field shape and strength
when combined with high FUV spectral resolution and diagnostics of stellar rotation and distribution
of circumstellar gas when combined with low near-UV spectral resolution; sufficient signal-to-noise
ratios: ~1000 for spectropolarimetric precisions of 0.1% per exposure; ~100 for detailed spectroscopic
studies; ~10 for exploring dimmer sources; and cadence: ranging from 1-10 minutes for most wind
variability studies.

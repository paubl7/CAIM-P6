The tension between current expansion rate H$_0$ using Planck data and direct model-independent
measurements in the local universe has reached a tension above 5$\sigma$ in the context of the $\Lambda$CDM
model. The growing tension among early time and local measurements of H$_0$ has not ameliorated
and remains a crucial and open question in cosmology. Solutions to understand this tension are possible
hidden sources of systematic error in the observable measurements or modifications to the concordance
$\Lambda$CDM model. In this work, we investigate a solution to the H$_0$ tension by modifying $\Lambda$CDM
and we add at early times extra relativistic energy density $\rho_{ex}$. In some context this $\rho_{ex}$
corresponds to EDE or Bound Dark Energy. We implement our model in CAMB and perform a full COSMO-MC
(MCMC) allowing to simultaneously fit the latest data from CMB anisotropies and the value of H$_0
= 74.03\pm 1.42,\mathrm{km\, s^{-1}Mpc^{-1}}$ from A. Riess [R-19] \ci{Riess:2019cxk}. The
inclusion of $\rho_{ex}$ ameliorates the tension between early and late time measurements only
slightly and we obtain a value H$_0 = (68.70\pm 0.45$\ksm) still in conflict with local measurements
[R-19]. We follow up our analysis by proposing two forecasting standard deviation $\sigma_H=1$
and $\sigma_H=0.5$ (in units of \ksm) for local distance measurements H$_0 = (74.03\pm \sigma_H)$
\ksm. From MCMC we obtain a value of H$_0 =(72.83\pm 0.47)$ \ksm\, at 68\% confidence level for $\sigma_H
=0.5$, fully consistent with [R-19], while the price to pay is a percentage increase of $0.12\%$
in CMB $\chi_{cmb}^2$. Finally, the extra energy density $\rho_{ex}$ leaves distinctive imprints
in the matter power spectrum at scales $k \sim k_c$ with $k_c=a_cH(a_c)$ and in the CMB power spectrum,
allowing for independent verification of our analysis.

Tidal interactions and planet evaporation processes impact the evolution of close-in star-planet
systems. We study the impact of stellar rotation on these processes. We compute the time evolution
of star-planet systems consisting of a planet with initial mass between 0.02 and 2.5 M$_{ Jup}$ (6
and 800 M$_{ Earth}$), in a quasi-circular orbit with an initial orbital distance between 0.01 and
0.10 au, around a solar-type star evolving from the Pre-Main-Sequence (PMS) until the end of the
Main-Sequence (MS) phase. We account for the evolution of: the stellar structure, the stellar angular
momentum due to tides and magnetic braking, the tidal interactions (equilibrium and dynamical
tides in stellar convective zones), the mass-evaporation of the planet, and the secular evolution
of the planetary orbit. We consider that at the beginning of the evolution, the proto-planetary
disk has fully dissipated and planet formation is complete. Both a rapid initial stellar rotation,
and a more efficient angular momentum transport inside the star, in general, contribute toward
the enlargement of the domain which is devoid of planets after the PMS phase, in the plane of planet
mass vs. orbital distance. Comparisons with the observed distribution of exoplanets orbiting
solar mass stars, in the plane of planet mass vs. orbital distance (addressing the "Neptunian desert"
feature), show an encouraging agreement with the present simulations, especially since no attempts
have been made to fine-tune initial parameters of the models to fit the observations. We also obtain
an upper limit for the orbital period of bare-core planets, that agrees with observations of the
"radius valley" feature in the plane of planet radius vs. orbital period. The two effects, tides
and planet evaporation, should be accounted for simultaneously and in a consistent way, with a detailed
model for the evolution of the star.

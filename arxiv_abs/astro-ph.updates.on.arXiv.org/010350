Low-ionization-state Mg II gas has been extensively studied in quasar sightline observations
to understand the cool, $\sim$$10^4$ K gas in the circumgalactic medium. Motivated by recent observations
showing that the Mg II gas around low-redshift galaxies has significant angular momentum, we use
the high-resolution EAGLE cosmological simulation to analyze the morphological and rotation
structures of the $z\approx0.3$ circumgalactic Mg II gas and examine how they change with the host
galaxy properties. Around star-forming galaxies, we find that the Mg II gas has an axisymmetric
instead of a spherical distribution, and the axis of symmetry aligns with that of the Mg II gas rotation.
A similar rotating structure is less commonly found in the small sample of simulated quiescent galaxies.
We also examine how often Mg II gas around galaxies selected using a line-of-sight velocity cut includes
gas physically outside of the virial radius ($r_\mathrm{vir}$). For example, we show that at an
impact parameter of 100 pkpc, a $\pm500$ km s$^{-1}$ velocity cut around galaxies with stellar masses
of $10^9$-$10^{9.5}\mathrm{M_\odot}$ ($10^{10}$-$10^{10.5}\mathrm{M_\odot}$) selects
Mg II gas beyond the virial radius 80% (6%) of the time. Because observers typically select Mg II gas
around target galaxies using such a velocity cut, we discuss how this issue affects the study of circumgalactic
Mg II gas properties, including the detection of corotation. While the corotating Mg II gas generally
extends beyond $0.5r_\mathrm{vir}$, the Mg II gas outside of the virial radius contaminates the
corotation signal and makes observers less likely to conclude that gas at large impact parameters
(e.g., $\gtrsim0.25 r_\mathrm{vir}$) is corotating.

(abridged) Context: Main-sequence late-type stars with masses less than $0.35 M_\odot$ are fully
convective. Aims: The goal is to study convection, differential rotation, and dynamos as functions
of rotation in fully convective stars. Methods: Three-dimensional hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic
numerical simulations with a star-in-a-box model, where a spherical star is immersed inside of
a Cartesian cube, are used. The model corresponds to a $0.2M_\odot$ M5 dwarf. Rotation periods ($P_{\rm
rot}$) between 4.3 and 430 days are explored. Results: The slowly rotating model with $P_{\rm rot}=430$
days produces anti-solar differential rotation with a slow equator and fast poles, along with predominantly
axisymmetric quasi-steady large-scale magnetic fields. For intermediate rotation ($P_{\rm
rot}=144$ and $43$ days) differential rotation is solar-like (fast equator, slow poles) and large-scale
magnetic fields are mostly axisymmetric and either quasi-stationary or cyclic. The latter occurs
in a similar parameter regime as in other numerical studies in spherical shells, and the cycle period
is similar to observed cycles in fully convective stars with comparable $P_{\rm rot}$. In the rapid
rotation regime the differential rotation is weak and the large-scale magnetic fields are increasingly
non-axisymmetric with a dominating $m=1$ mode. This large-scale non-axisymmetric field also
exhibits azimuthal dynamo waves. Conclusions: The results of the star-in-a-box models agree with
simulations of partially convective late-type stars in spherical shells in that the transitions
in differential rotation and dynamo regimes occur at similar rotational regimes in terms of the
Coriolis (inverse Rossby) number. This similarity between partially and fully convective stars
suggests that the processes generating differential rotation and large-scale magnetism are insensitive
to the geometry of the star.

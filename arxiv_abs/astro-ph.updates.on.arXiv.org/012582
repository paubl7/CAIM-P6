X-ray observations provide a unique probe of the accretion disk corona of supermassive black holes
(SMBHs). In this paper, we present a uniform \emph{Chandra} X-ray data analysis of a sample of 152
$z\geq4.5$ quasars. We firmly detect 46 quasars of this sample in 0.5-2~keV above 3~$\sigma$ and
calculate the upper limits of the X-ray flux of the remaining. We also estimate the power law photon
index of the X-ray spectrum of 31 quasars. 24 of our sample quasars are detected in the FIRST or NVSS
radio surveys; all of them are radio-loud. We statistically compare the X-ray properties of our
$z\geq4.5$ quasars to other X-ray samples of AGN at different redshifts. The relation between the
rest-frame X-ray luminosity and other quasar parameters, such as the bolometric luminosity, UV
luminosity, or SMBH mass, show large scatters. These large scatters can be attributed to the narrow
luminosity range at the highest redshift, the large measurement error based on relatively poor
X-ray data, and the inclusion of radio-loud quasars in the sample. The $L_{\rm X}-L_{\rm UV}$ relationship
is significantly sub-linear. We do not find a significant redshift evolution of the $L_{\rm X}-L_{\rm
UV}$ relation, expressed either in the slope of this relation, or the departure of individual AGNs
from the best-fit $\alpha_{\rm OX}-L_{\rm UV}$ relation ($\Delta\alpha_{\rm OX}$). The median
value of the X-ray photon index is $\Gamma\approx1.79$, which does not show redshift evolution
from $z=0$ to $z\sim7$. The X-ray and UV properties of the most distant quasars could potentially
be used as a standard candle to constrain cosmological models. The large scatter of our sample on
the Hubble diagram highlights the importance of future large unbiased deep X-ray and radio surveys
in using quasars in cosmological studies.

The population of passive, compact, high-redshift galaxies known as red nuggets is believed to
end up in the core of current giant early-type galaxies. We investigate this scenario for NGC 3311,
the brightest galaxy of the Hydra I cluster, a massive early-type galaxy with multiple structural
components, including a low-velocity dispersion core and an extended stellar halo. We use MUSE
observations to map the stellar populations of NGC 3311 out to 2 effective radii to trace its mass
assembly back in time. Using a customized and extended version of the state-of-the-art single stellar
population models EMILES, and a newly developed parametric fully Bayesian framework, we model
the observed spectra using full-spectrum fitting and produce 2D maps of the stellar velocity dispersion,
age, total metallicity, $\alpha$-element, sodium abundance, and the initial mass function (IMF)
slope. The core, which we identify as a red nugget, dominates the light budget within $R\lesssim
1.5$ kpc, has a relatively small velocity dispersion ($\sigma_*\approx 180$ km s$^{-1}$), is old
(ages$\gtrsim 11$ Gyr), metal-rich ([Z/H]$\sim0.2$ and [Na/Fe]$\sim0.4$), and has a bottom-heavy
IMF (with slope $\Gamma_b\sim2.4$). In the outer region, stars become increasingly hotter, younger,
metal and sodium poorer, $\alpha$-element richer, and the IMF slope becomes Chabrier-like with
increasing galactocentric distances. The multiple structural components in NGC 3311 confirm
the expectations of the two-phase formation scenario for NGC 3311, where red nuggets are formed
first in a very short, high-z star formation episode, and later grow in size by the extended mass assembly
of satellites. Interestingly, the outer stellar population has an overabundant [$\alpha$/Fe],
most likely because NGC 3311, located at the center of the galaxy cluster, accreted stars from rapidly
quenched satellites. [Abridged]

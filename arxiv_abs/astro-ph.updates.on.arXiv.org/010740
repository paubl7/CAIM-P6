We report the discovery of COOL J1241+2219, a strongly-lensed galaxy at redshift $z$=5.043$\pm$0.002
with observed magnitude $z_{AB}=20.47$, lensed by a moderate-mass galaxy cluster at $z$=1.001$\pm$0.001.
COOL J1241+2219 is the brightest lensed galaxy currently known at optical and near-infrared wavelengths
at $z$ $\gtrsim$ 5; it is $\sim$5 times brighter than the prior record-holder lensed galaxy, and
several magnitudes brighter than the brightest unlensed galaxies known at these redshifts. It
was discovered as part of COOL-LAMPS, a collaboration initiated to find strongly lensed systems
in recent public optical imaging data. We characterise the lensed galaxy, as well as the central
galaxy of the lensing cluster using ground-based $griz$JH imaging and optical spectroscopy. We
report model-based magnitudes, and derive stellar masses, dust content, metallicity and star-formation
rates via stellar-population synthesis modeling. Our lens mass modeling, based on ground-based
imaging, implies a median source magnification of $\sim$30, which puts the stellar mass and star
formation rate (in the youngest age bin, closest to the epoch of observation) at logM$_{*}$ = $10.11^{+0.21}_{-0.26}$
and SFR = $27^{+13}_{-9}$ M$_{\odot}$/yr, respectively. We constrain a star formation history
for COOL J1241+2219 consistent with constant star formation across $\sim$1 Gyr of cosmic time,
and that places this galaxy on the high-mass end of the star-forming main sequence. COOL J1241+2219
is 2-4 times more luminous than a galaxy with the characteristic UV luminosity at these redshifts.
The UV continuum slope $\beta$= -2.2$\pm$0.2 places this galaxy on the blue side of the observed
distribution of galaxies at $z$=5, although the lack of Ly$\alpha$ emission indicates dust sufficient
to suppress this emission.

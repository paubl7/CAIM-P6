The Ultraviolet Transient Astronomical Satellite is a scientific space mission carrying an astronomical
telescope. The mission is led by the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel and the Israel Space
Agency, while the camera in the focal plane is designed and built by Deutsches Elektronen Synchrotron
in Germany. Two key science goals of the mission are the detection of counterparts to gravitational
wave sources and supernovae. The launch to geostationary orbit is planned for 2024. The telescope
with a field-of-view of $\approx200$deg$^2$, is optimized to work in the near-ultraviolet band
between $220$ and $280$nm. The focal plane array is composed of four $22.4$-megapixel, backside-illuminated
CMOS sensors with a total active area of 90x90mm$^2$. Prior to sensor production, smaller test sensors
have been tested to support critical design decisions for the final flight sensor. These test sensors
share the design of epitaxial layer and anti-reflective coatings (ARC) with the flight sensors.
Here, we present a characterization of these test sensors. Dark current and read noise are characterized
as a function of the device temperature. A temperature-independent noise level is attributed to
on-die infrared emission and the read-out electronics` self-heating. We utilize a high-precision
photometric calibration setup to obtain the test sensors` quantum efficiency (QE) relative to
PTB/NIST-calibrated transfer standards ($220$-$1100$nm), the quantum yield for $\lambda < 300$nm,
the non-linearity of the system, and the conversion gain. The uncertainties are discussed in the
context of the newest results on the setup`s performance parameters. From three ARC options, Tstd,
T1 and T2, the latter optimizes out-of-band rejection and peaks in the mid of the ULTRASAT operational
waveband (max. QE $\approx80\%$ at $245\mathrm{nm}$). We recommend ARC option T2 for the final
ULTRASAT UV sensor.

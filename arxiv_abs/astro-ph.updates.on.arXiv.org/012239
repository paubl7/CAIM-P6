It is well known that magnetic fields dominate the dynamics in the solar corona, and new generation
of numerical modelling of the evolution of coronal magnetic fields, as featured with boundary conditions
driven directly by observation data, are being developed. This paper describes a new approach of
data-driven magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation of solar active region (AR) magnetic field
evolution, which is for the first time that a data-driven full-MHD model utilizes directly the photospheric
velocity field from DAVE4VM. We constructed a well-established MHD equilibrium based on a single
vector magnetogram by employing an MHD-relaxation approach with sufficiently small kinetic viscosity,
and used this MHD equilibrium as the initial conditions for subsequent data-driven evolution.
Then we derived the photospheric surface flows from a time series of observed magentograms based
on the DAVE4VM method. The surface flows are finally inputted in time sequence to the bottom boundary
of the MHD model to self-consistently update the magnetic field at every time step by solving directly
the magnetic induction equation at the bottom boundary. We applied this data-driven model to study
the magnetic field evolution of AR 12158 with SDO/HMI vector magnetograms. Our model reproduced
a quasi-static stress of the field lines through mainly the rotational flow of the AR's leading sunspot,
which makes the core field lines to form a coherent S shape consistent with the sigmoid structure
as seen in the SDO/AIA images. The total magnetic energy obtained in the simulation matches closely
the accumulated magnetic energy as calculated directly from the original vector magnetogram with
the DAVE4VM derived flow field. Such a data-driven model will be used to study how the coronal field,
as driven by the slow photospheric motions, reaches a unstable state and runs into eruptions.

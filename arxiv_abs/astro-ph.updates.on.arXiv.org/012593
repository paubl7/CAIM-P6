[abridged] We analyse four transits of WASP-33b observed with the optical high-resolution HARPS-N
spectrograph to confirm its nodal precession, study its atmosphere and investigate the presence
of star-planet interactions.We extract the mean line profiles of the spectra by using the LSD method,
and analyse the Doppler shadow and the RVs. We also derive the transmission spectrum of the planet,
correcting it for the stellar contamination due to rotation, CLV and pulsations. We confirm the
previously discovered nodal precession of WASP-33b, almost doubling the time coverage of the inclination
and projected spin-orbit angle variation. We find that the projected obliquity reached a minimum
in 2011 and use this constraint to derive the geometry of the system, in particular its obliquity
at that epoch ($\epsilon=113.99^{\circ}\pm 0.22^{\circ}$) and the inclination of the stellar
spin axis ($i_{\rm s}=90.11^{\circ}\pm 0.12^{\circ}$), as well as the gravitational quadrupole
moment of the star $J_2=(6.73\pm 0.22)\times 10^{-5}$. We present detections of H$\alpha$ and
H$\beta$ absorption in the atmosphere of the planet with a contrast almost twice smaller than previously
detected in the literature. We also find evidence for the presence of a pre-transit signal, which
repeats in all four analysed transits. The most likely explanation lies in a possible excitation
of a stellar pulsation mode by the presence of the planetary companion. Future common analysis of
all available datasets in the literature will help shedding light on the possibility that the observed
Balmer lines transit depth variations are related to stellar activity and/or pulsation, and to
set constraints on the energetics possibly driving atmospheric escape. A complete orbital phase
coverage of WASP-33b with high-resolution spectroscopic (spectro-polarimetric) observations
could help understanding the nature of the pre-transit signal.

Asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars are known to lose a significant amount of mass by a stellar wind,
which controls the remainder of their stellar lifetime. High angular-resolution observations
show that the winds of these cool stars typically exhibit mid- to small-scale density perturbations
such as spirals and arcs, believed to be caused by the gravitational interaction with a (sub-)stellar
companion. We aim to explore the effects of the wind-companion interaction on the 3D density and
velocity distribution of the wind, as a function of three key parameters: wind velocity, binary
separation and companion mass. For the first time, we compare the impact on the outflow of a planetary
companion to that of a stellar companion. We intend to devise a morphology classification scheme
based on a singular parameter. With our grid of models we cover the prominent morphology changes
in a companion-perturbed AGB outflow: slow winds with a close, massive binary companion show a more
complex morphology. Additionally, we prove that massive planets are able to significantly impact
the density structure of an AGB wind. We find that the interaction with a companion affects the terminal
velocity of the wind, which can be explained by the gravitational slingshot mechanism. We distinguish
between two types of wind focussing to the orbital plane resulting from distinct mechanisms: global
flattening of the outflow as a result of the AGB star's orbital motion and the formation of an EDE as
a consequence of the companion's gravitational pull. We investigate different morphology classification
schemes and uncover that the ratio of the gravitational potential energy density of the companion
to the kinetic energy density of the AGB outflow yields a robust classification parameter for the
models presented in this paper.

In the past decade, the observations of diffuse radio synchrotron emission toward galaxy clusters
revealed cosmic-ray (CR) electrons and magnetic fields on megaparsec scales. However, their origin
remains poorly understood, and several models have been discussed in the literature. CR protons
are also expected to accumulate during the formation of clusters and probably contribute to the
production of these high-energy electrons. In order to understand the physics of CRs in clusters,
combining of observations at various wavelengths is particularly relevant. The exploitation
of such data requires using a self-consistent approach including both the thermal and the nonthermal
components, so that it is capable of predicting observables associated with the multiwavelength
probes at play, in particular in the radio, millimeter, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands. We develop and
describe such a self-consistent modeling framework, called MINOT (modeling the intracluster
medium (non-)thermal content and observable prediction tools) and make this tool available to
the community. The multiwavelength observables are computed based on the relevant physical process,
according to the cluster location, and based on the sampling defined by the user. We describe the
implementation of MINOT and how to use it. We also discuss the different assumptions and approximations
that are involved and provide various examples regarding the production of output products at different
wavelengths. As an illustration, we model the clusters A1795, A2142, and A2255 and compare the MINOT
predictions to literature data. MINOT can be used to model the cluster thermal and nonthermal physical
processes for a wide variety of datasets in the radio, millimeter, X-ray, and gamma-ray bands, as
well as the neutrino emission. [abridged]

Hydrogen-line emission, thought to come from accretion shocks, has been observed at planetary-mass
objects, and current or upcoming dedicated instruments should reveal many more sources. Previous
work predicted shock spectra in the case of a shock on the circumplanetary disc. However no extensive
investigation has been done on the planet-surface shock. Our main goals are to calculate the global
spectral energy distribution (SED) of an accreting planet by combining our model emission spectra
with photospheric SEDs, and to predict the line-integrated flux for different hydrogen lines,
focusing on Ha (H alpha) and including H b, Pa a, Pa b, Pa g, Br a, and Br g. We apply our non-equilibrium
calculations to the surface accretion shock for the relevant large parameter space of accretion
rate Mdot and mass M_p. In contrast to our previous model, fits to formation calculations provide
radii and effective temperatures. We do not consider extinction by the preshock material here.
We find that the Ha line luminosity increases monotonically with Mdot and M_p, ranging from 1e-8
to 1e-4 Lsun, depending mostly on the accretion rate and weakly on the mass for the relevant range
of parameters. We apply the result to the observed planets around PDS 70 and demonstrate that the
estimated accretion rate is consistent with previous studies. The Lyman, Balmer, and Paschen continua
can be visible above the photosphere. The H b flux ranges between 0.1 and around 1 times the Ha flux,
whereas other lines are weaker (~0.001-0.1). Based on spectroscopic observations, shocks on the
planetary surface and on the CPD surface can be distinguished at very high spectral resolution.
The planet surface shock however likely dominates in total intensity if both are present. These
predictions of the luminosity in Ha and other lines serve as a baseline prediction or as a tool for
interpreting observations of accreting planets.

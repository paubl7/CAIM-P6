Determining the clumpiness of matter around galaxies is pivotal to a full understanding of the spatially
inhomogeneous, multi-phase gas in the circumgalactic medium (CGM). We combine high spatially
resolved 3D observations with hydrodynamical cosmological simulations to measure the cold circumgalactic
gas clumpiness. We present new adaptive-optics-assisted VLT/MUSE observations of a quadruply
lensed quasar, targeting the CGM of 2 foreground $z\sim$1 galaxies observed in absorption. We additionally
use zoom-in FOGGIE simulations with exquisite resolution ($\sim$0.1 kpc scales) in the CGM of galaxies
to compute the physical properties of cold gas traced by Mg\,II absorbers. By contrasting these
mock-observables with the VLT/MUSE observations, we find a large spread of fractional variations
of Mg\,II equivalent widths with physical separation, both in observations and simulations. The
simulations indicate a dependence of the Mg\,II coherence length on the underlying gas morphology
(filaments vs clumps). The $z_{\rm abs}$=1.168 Mg\,II system shows coherence over $\gtrsim$ 6
kpc and is associated with an [O\,II] emitting galaxy situated 89 kpc away, with SFR $\geq$ 4.6 $\pm$
{1.5} $\rm M_{\odot}$/yr and $M_{*}=10^{9.6\pm0.2} M_{\odot}$. Based on this combined analysis,
we determine that the absorber is consistent with being an inflowing filament. The $z_{\rm abs}$=1.393
Mg\,II system traces dense CGM gas clumps varying in strength over $\lesssim$ 2 kpc physical scales.
Our findings suggest that this absorber is likely related to an outflowing clump. Our joint approach
combining 3D-spectroscopy observations of lensed systems and simulations with extreme resolution
in the CGM put new constraints on the clumpiness of cold CGM gas, a key diagnostic of the baryon cycle.

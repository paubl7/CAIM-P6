Recent cosmic-ray measurements are challenging our models of propagation in the Galaxy. A good
characterization of the secondary cosmic rays (B, Be, Li and sub-iron species) is crucial to constrain
these models and exploit the precision of modern CR experiments. In this work, a Markov chain Monte
Carlo analysis has been implemented to fit the experimental flux ratios between B, Be and Li and their
flux ratios to the primary nuclei C and O. We have fitted the data using two different parametrizations
for the spallation cross sections. The uncertainties in the evaluation of the spectra of these secondary
cosmic rays, due to spallation cross sections, have been considered by introducing scale factors
as nuisance parameters. We have also tested two different formulations for the diffusion coefficient,
which differ in the origin of the high energy hardening of cosmic rays. Additionally, two different
approaches are used to scale the cross sections, one based on a combined analysis of all the species
("combined" analysis) and the other reproducing the high energy spectra of the secondary-to-secondary
flux ratios of Be/B, Li/B, Li/Be ("scaled" analysis). This allows us to make a better comparison
between the propagation parameters inferred from the cross sections parametrizations tested
in this work. This novel analysis has been successfully implemented using the numerical code DRAGON2
to reproduce the cosmic-ray nuclei data up to $Z=14$ from the AMS-02 experiment. It is found that
the ratios of Li favor a harder spectral index of the diffusion coefficient, but compatible with
the other ratios inside the observed $2\sigma$ uncertainties. In addition, it is shown that, including
these scale factors, the secondary-to-primary flux ratios can be simultaneously reproduced.

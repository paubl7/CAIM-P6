Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations are increasing their level of realism by considering
more physical processes, having more resolution or larger statistics. However, one usually has
to either sacrifice the statistical power of such simulations or the resolution reach within galaxies.
Here, we introduce the NewHorizon project where a zoom-in region of $\sim(16\,\rm Mpc)^3$, larger
than a standard zoom-in region around a single halo, embedded in a larger box is simulated at high
resolution. A resolution of up to 34 pc, typical of individual zoom-in resimulated halos is reached
within galaxies, allowing the simulation to capture the multi-phase nature of the interstellar
medium and the clumpy nature of the star formation process in galaxies. In this introductory paper,
we present several key fundamental properties of galaxies and of their black holes including the
galaxy mass function, the cosmic star formation rate, the galactic metallicities, the Kennicutt-Schmidt
relation, the stellar-to-halo mass relation, the galaxy sizes, their stellar kinematics and morphology,
the gas content within galaxies and its kinematics, and the black hole mass and spin properties over
time. The various scaling relations are broadly reproduced by NewHorizon with some differences
with the standard observables. Due to its exquisite spatial resolution, NewHorizon captures the
inefficient process of star formation in galaxies, which evolve over time from being more turbulent,
gas-rich and star-bursting at high redshift. These high redshift galaxies are also more compact,
and are more elliptical and clumpier until the level of internal gas turbulence decays enough to
allow for the formation of discs. The NewHorizon simulation gives access to a broad range of galaxy
physics at low-to-intermediate stellar masses, a regime that will become accessible in the near
future through surveys such as the LSST.

Understanding the origin of chondritic components and their accretion pathways is critical to
unravel the magnitude of mass transport in the protoplanetary disk, the accretionary history of
the terrestrial planet region and, by extension, its prebiotic inventory. Here, we trace the heritage
of pristine components from the relatively unaltered CV chondrite Leoville through their mass-independent
Cr and mass-dependent Zn isotope compositions. Investigating these chondritic fractions in such
detail reveals an onion-shell structure of chondrules, which is characterized by 54Cr- and 66Zn-poor
cores surrounded by increasingly 54Cr- and 66Zn-rich igneous rims and an outer coating of fine-grained
dust. This is interpreted as a progressive addition of 54Cr- and 66Zn-rich, CI-like material to
the accretion region of these carbonaceous chondrites. Our findings show that the observed Cr isotopic
range in chondrules from more altered CV chondrites is the result of chemical equilibration between
chondrules and matrix during secondary alteration. The 54Cr-poor nature of the cores of Leoville
chondrules implies formation in the inner Solar System and subsequent massive outward chondrule
transport past the Jupiter barrier. At the same time, CI-like dust is transferred inwards. We propose
that the accreting Earth acquired CI-like dust through this mechanism within the lifetime of the
disk. This radial mixing of chondrules and matrix shows the limited capacity of Jupiter to act as
an efficient barrier and maintain the proposed non-carbonaceous and carbonaceous chondrite dichotomy
over time. Finally, also considering current astrophysical models, we explore both inner and outer
Solar System origins for the CV chondrite parent body.

As end products of the hierarchical process of cosmic structure formation, galaxy clusters present
some predictable properties, like the ones mostly driven by the gravity, and some others, more affected
from astrophysical dissipative processes, that can be recovered from observations and that show
remarkable "universal" behaviour once rescaled by halo mass and redshift. However, a consistent
picture that links these "universal" radial profiles and the integrated values of the thermodynamical
quantities of the intracluster medium, also quantifying the deviations from the standard self-similar
gravity-driven scenario, has to be demonstrated. In this work, we use a semi-analytic model based
on a "universal" pressure profile in hydrostatic equilibrium within a cold dark matter halo with
a defined relation between mass and concentration to reconstruct the scaling laws between the X-ray
properties of galaxy clusters. We also quantify any deviation from the self-similar predictions
in term of temperature dependence of few physical quantities like the gas mass fraction, the relation
between spectroscopic temperature and its global value, and, if present, the hydrostatic mass
bias. This model allows to reconstruct both the observed profiles and the scaling laws between integrated
quantities. We use the Planck-selected ESZ sample to calibrate the predicted scaling laws between
gas mass, temperature, luminosity and total mass. Our "universal" model reproduces well the observed
thermodynamic properties and provides a way to interpret the observed deviations from the standard
self-similar behaviour. By combining these results with the constraints on the observed $Y_{SZ}-T$
relation, we show how we can quantify the level of gas clumping affecting the studied sample, estimate
the clumping-free gas mass fraction, and suggest the average level of hydrostatic bias present.

We present a panchromatic study of 11 (sub-)millimetre selected DSFGs with spectroscopically
confirmed redshift ($1.5< z_{\rm spec}<3$) in the GOODS-S field, with the aim of constraining their
astrophysical properties (e.g., age, stellar mass, dust and gas content) and characterizing their
role in the context of galaxy evolution. The multi-wavelength coverage of GOODS-S, from X-rays
to radio band, allow us to model galaxy SED by using CIGALE with a novel approach, based on a physical
motivated modelling of stellar light attenuation by dust. Median stellar mass ($\simeq6.5\times10^{10}$
M$_\odot$) and SFR ($\simeq241$ M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$) are consistent with galaxy main-sequence
at $z\sim2$. The galaxies are experiencing an intense and dusty burst of star formation (median
L$_{\rm IR}\simeq2\times10^{12}$ L$_\odot$), with a median age of $750$ Myr. The high median content
of interstellar dust (M$_{\rm dust}\simeq5\times10^8$ M$_\odot$) suggests a rapid enrichment
of the ISM (on timescales $\sim10^8$ yr). We derived galaxy total and molecular gas content from
CO spectroscopy and/or Rayleigh-Jeans dust continuum ($10^{10}\lesssim$ M$_{\rm gas}/$M$_\odot\lesssim10^{11}$),
depleted over a typical timescale $\tau_{\rm depl}\sim200$ Myr. X-ray and radio luminosities
suggest that most of the galaxies hosts an accreting radio silent/quiet SMBH. This evidence, along
with their compact multi-wavelength sizes (median r$_{\rm ALMA}\sim$ r$_{\rm VLA}=1.8$ kpc,
r$_{\rm HST}=2.3$ kpc) measured from high-resolution imaging ($\theta_{\rm res}\lesssim$ 1
arcsec), indicates these objects as the high-z star-forming counterparts of massive quiescent
galaxies, as predicted e.g., by the in-situ scenario. Four objects show some signatures of a forthcoming/ongoing
AGN feedback, that is thought to trigger the morphological transition from star-forming disks
to ETGs.

Light bridges (LBs) are bright lanes that divide an umbra into multiple parts in some sunspots. Persistent
oscillatory bright fronts at a temperature of $\sim$$10^5$ K are commonly observed above LBs in
the 1400/1330 \AA~passbands of the Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph (IRIS). Based on IRIS
observations, we report small-scale bright blobs from the oscillating bright front above a light
bridge. Some of these blobs reveal a clear acceleration, whereas the others do not. The average speed
of these blobs projected onto the plane of sky is $71.7\pm14.7$ km s$^{-1}$, with an initial acceleration
of $1.9\pm1.3$ km s$^{-2}$. These blobs normally reach a projected distance of 3--7 Mm from their
origin sites. From the transition region images we find an average projected area of $0.57\pm0.37$
Mm$^{2}$ for the blobs. The blobs were also detected in multi-passbands of the Solar Dynamics Observatory,
but not in the H$\alpha$ images. These blobs are likely to be plasma ejections, and we investigate
their kinematics and energetics. Through emission measure analyses, the typical temperature
and electron density of these blobs are found to be around $10^{5.47}$ K and $10^{9.7}$ cm$^{-3}$,
respectively. The estimated kinetic and thermal energies are on the order of $10^{22.8}$ erg and
$10^{23.3}$ erg, respectively. These small-scale blobs appear to show three different types of
formation process. They are possibly triggered by induced reconnection or release of enhanced
magnetic tension due to interaction of adjacent shocks, local magnetic reconnection between emerging
magnetic bipoles on the light bridge and surrounding unipolar umbral fields, and plasma acceleration
or instability caused by upward shocks, respectively.

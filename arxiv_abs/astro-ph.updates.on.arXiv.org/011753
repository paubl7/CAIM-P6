Black-hole (BH) binary mergers driven by gravitational perturbations of tertiary companions
constitute an important class of dynamical formation channels for compact binaries detected by
LIGO/VIRGO. Recent works have examined numerically the combined orbital and spin dynamics of BH
binaries that undergo large Lidov-Kozai (LK) eccentricity oscillations induced by a highly inclined
companion and merge via gravitational wave radiation. However, the extreme eccentricity variations
make such systems difficult to characterize analytically. In this paper, we develop an analytical
formalism for understanding the spin dynamics of binary BHs undergoing LK-induced mergers. We
show that, under certain conditions, the eccentricity oscillations of the binary can be averaged
over to determine the long-term behavior of the BH spin in a smooth way. In particular, we demonstrate
that the final spin-orbit misalignment angle $\theta_{\rm sl}$ is often related to the binary's
primordial spin orientation through an approximate adiabatic invariant. Our theory explains
the "$90^\circ$ attractor" (as found in recent numerical studies) for the evolution of $\theta_{\rm
sl}$ when the initial BH spin is aligned with the orbital axis and the octupole LK effects are negligible
-- such a "$90^\circ$ attractor" would lead to a small binary effective spin parameter $\chi_{\rm
eff}\sim 0$ even for large intrinsic BH spins. We calculate the deviation from adiabaticity in closed
form as a function of the initial conditions. We also place accurate constraints on when this adiabatic
invariant breaks down due to resonant spin-orbit interactions. We consider both stellar-mass
and supermassive BH tertiary companions, and provide simple prescriptions for determining analytically
the final spin-orbit misalignment angles of the merging BH binaries.

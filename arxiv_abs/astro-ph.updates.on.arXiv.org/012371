The Rosetta mission provided us with detailed data of the surface of the nucleus of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.In
order to better understand the physical processes associated with the comet activity and the surface
evolution of its nucleus, we performed a detailed comparative morphometrical analysis of two depressions
located in the Ash region. To detect morphological temporal changes, we compared pre- and post-perihelion
high-resolution (pixel scale of 0.07-1.75 m) OSIRIS images of the two depressions. We quantified
the changes using the dynamic heights and the gravitational slopes calculated from the Digital
Terrain Model (DTM) of the studied area using the ArcGIS software before and after perihelion. Our
comparative morphometrical analysis allowed us to detect and quantify the temporal changes that
occurred in two depressions of the Ash region during the last perihelion passage. We find that the
two depressions grew by several meters. The area of the smallest depression (structure I) increased
by 90+/-20%, with two preferential growths: one close to the cliff associated with the apparition
of new boulders at its foot, and a second one on the opposite side of the cliff. The largest depression
(structure II) grew in all directions, increasing in area by 20+/-5%, and no new deposits have been
detected. We interpreted these two depression changes as being driven by the sublimation of ices,
which explains their global growth and which can also trigger landslides. The deposits associated
with depression II reveal a stair-like topography, indicating that they have accumulated during
several successive landslides from different perihelion passages. Overall, these observations
bring additional evidence of complex active processes and reshaping events occurring on short
timescales, such as depression growth and landslides, and on longer timescales, such as cliff retreat.

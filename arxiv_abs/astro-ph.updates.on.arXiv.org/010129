Isotopic anomalies in chondrules hold important clues about the dynamics of mixing and transport
processes in the solar accretion disk. These anomalies have been interpreted to indicate either
disk-wide transport of chondrules or local heterogeneities of chondrule precursors. However,
all previous studies relied on isotopic data for a single element (either Cr, Ti, or O), which does
not allow distinguishing between source and precursor signatures as the cause of the chondrules
isotope anomalies. Here we obtained the first combined O, Ti, and Cr isotope data for individual
chondrules from enstatite, ordinary, and carbonaceous chondrites. We find that chondrules from
non-carbonaceous (NC) chondrites have relatively homogeneous {\Delta}17O, {\epsilon}50Ti,
and {\epsilon}54Cr, which are similar to the compositions of their host chondrites. By contrast,
chondrules from carbonaceous chondrites (CC) have more variable compositions. Although the compositions
of the analyzed CC and NC chondrules may overlap for either {\epsilon}50Ti, {\epsilon}54Cr, or
{\Delta}17O, in multi-isotope space none of the CC chondrules plot in the compositional field of
NC chondrites, and no NC chondrule plots within the field of CC chondrites. As such, our data reveal
a fundamental isotopic difference between NC and CC chondrules, which is inconsistent with a disk-wide
transport of chondrules across and between the NC and CC reservoirs. Instead, the isotopic variations
among CC chondrules reflect local precursor heterogeneities, which most likely result from mixing
between NC-like dust and a chemically diverse dust component that was isotopically similar to CAIs
and AOAs.The same mixing processes, but on a larger, disk-wide scale, were likely responsible for
establishing the distinct isotopic compositions of the NC and CC reservoirs, which represent in
inner and outer disk, respectively.

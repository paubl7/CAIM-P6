The full third Gaia data release will provide the calibrated spectra obtained with the blue and red
Gaia slit-less spectrophotometers. The main challenge when facing Gaia spectral calibration
is that no lamp spectra or flat fields are available during the mission. Also, the significant size
of the line spread function with respect to the dispersion of the prisms produces alien photons contaminating
neighbouring positions of the spectra. This makes the calibration special and different from standard
approaches. This work gives a detailed description of the internal calibration model to obtain
the spectrophotometric data in the Gaia catalogue. The main purpose of the internal calibration
is to bring all the epoch spectra onto a common flux and pixel (pseudo-wavelength) scale, taking
into account variations over the focal plane and with time, producing a mean spectrum from all the
observations of the same source. In order to describe all observations in a common mean flux and pseudo-wavelength
scale, we construct a suitable representation of the internally calibrated mean spectra via basis
functions and we describe the transformation between non calibrated epoch spectra and calibrated
mean spectra via a discrete convolution, parametrising the convolution kernel to recover the relevant
coefficients. The model proposed here is able to combine all observations into a mean instrument
to allow the comparison of different sources and observations obtained with different instrumental
conditions along the mission and the generation of mean spectra from a number of observations of
the same source. The output of this model provides the internal mean spectra, not as a sampled function
(flux and wavelength), but as a linear combination of basis functions, although sampled spectra
can easily be derived from them.

Inward migration of giant planets is predicted by hydrodynamical simulations during the gas phase
of the protoplanetary disc. The phenomenon is also invoked to explain resonant and near-resonant
exoplanetary system structures. The early inward migration may also have affected our Solar System
and sculpted its different minor planet reservoirs. In this study we explore how the early inward
migration of the giant planets shapes the Kuiper Belt. We test different scenarios with only Neptune
and Uranus and with all the four giant planets, including also some models with the subsequent outward
planetesimal-driven migration of Neptune after the gas dispersal. We find objects populating
mean motion resonances even when Neptune and Uranus do not migrate at all or only migrate inwards.
When the planets are fixed, planetesimals stick only temporarily to the mean motion resonances,
while inwards migration yields a new channel to populate the resonances without invoking convergent
migration. In these cases, however, it is hard to populate mean motion resonances that do not cross
the planetesimal disc (such as 2:1 and 5:2) and there is a lack of resonant KBOs that cross Neptune's
orbit. These Neptune crossers are an unambiguous signature of the outward migration of Neptune.
The starting position and the growth rate of Neptune matters for the contamination of the classical
Kuiper belt region from neighbouring regions. The eccentricity and inclination space of the hot
classicals and the scattered disc region become much more populated when all the giant planets are
included. The 5:2 resonance with Neptune becomes increasingly populated with deeper inward migrations
of Neptune. The overall inclination distribution, however, is still narrower than from observations,
as is generally the case for Kuiper belt population models.

We analyse the kinematics and dynamics of a homogeneous sample of red clump stars selected from the
second Gaia data release catalogue in the direction of the Galactic poles. The level of completeness
of the sample at heights between 0.6 and 3.5 kpc is asserted by comparison with the 2 Micron All Sky
Survey catalogue. We show that both the density distribution and velocity dispersion are significantly
more perturbed in the North than in the South, in all analysed regions of our Galactic neighbourhoods.
We provide a detailed assessment of these North-South asymmetries at large heights. We then proceed
to evaluate how such asymmetries could affect determinations of the dynamical matter density under
equilibrium assumptions. We find that a Jeans analysis delivers relatively similar vertical forces
and integrated dynamical surface densities at large heights above the plane in both hemispheres.
At these heights, the densities of stars and gas are very low and the surface density is largely dominated
by dark matter, which allows to estimate, separately in the North and South, the local dark matter
density derived under equilibrium assumptions. In the presence of vertical perturbations, such
values should be considered as an upper limit. This Jeans analysis yields values of the local dark
matter density above 2~kpc, $\rho_{\rm DM} \sim 0.013 \, {\rm M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$ ($ \sim 0.509
\, {\rm GeV/cm}^3$) in the perturbed Northern hemisphere, and $\rho_{\rm DM} \sim 0.010 \, {\rm
M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$ ($ \sim 0.374 \, {\rm GeV/cm}^3$) in the much less perturbed South. As a comparison,
we determine the local dark matter density by fitting a global phase-space distribution to the data.
We end up with a value in the range of $\rho_{\rm DM} \sim 0.011 - 0.014 \, {\rm M}_\odot/{\rm pc}^3$
in global agreement with Jeans analysis.

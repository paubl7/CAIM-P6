We present a Bayesian method for estimating instrumental noise parameters and propagating noise
uncertainties within the global BeyondPlanck Gibbs sampling framework, and apply this to Planck
LFI time-ordered data. Following previous literature, we adopt a simple $1/f$ model for the noise
power spectral density (PSD), and implement an optimal Wiener-filter (or constrained realization)
gap-filling procedure to account for masked data. We then use this procedure to both estimate the
gapless correlated noise in the time-domain, $n_\mathrm{corr}$, and to sample the noise PSD spectral
parameters, $\xi^n = \{\sigma_0, f_\mathrm{knee}, \alpha\}$. In contrast to previous Planck
analyses, we only assume piecewise stationary noise within each pointing period (PID), not throughout
the full mission, but we adopt the LFI DPC results as priors on $\alpha$ and $f_\mathrm{knee}$. On
average, we find best-fit correlated noise parameters that are mostly consistent with previous
results, with a few notable exceptions. However, a detailed inspection of the time-dependent results
reveals many important findings. First and foremost, we find strong evidence for statistically
significant temporal variations in all noise PSD parameters, many of which are directly correlated
with satellite housekeeping data. Second, while the simple $1/f$ model appears to be an excellent
fit for the LFI 70 GHz channel, there is evidence for additional correlated noise not described by
a $1/f$ model in the 30 and 44 GHz channels, including within the primary science frequency range
of 0.1-1 Hz. In general, most 30 and 44 GHz channels exhibit excess noise at the 2-$3 \sigma$ level
in each one hour pointing period. For some periods of time, we also find evidence of strong common
mode noise fluctuations across the entire focal plane. (Abridged.)

Polarized dust continuum emission has been observed with ALMA in an increasing number of deeply
embedded protostellar systems. It generally shows a sharp transition going from the protostellar
envelope to the disk scale, with the polarization fraction typically dropping from ${\sim} 5\%$
to ${\sim} 1\%$ and the inferred magnetic field orientations becoming more aligned with the major
axis of the system. We quantitatively investigate these observational trends using a sample of
protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud and compare these features with a non-ideal MHD disk formation
simulation. We find that the gas density increases faster than the magnetic field strength in the
transition from the envelope to the disk scale, which makes it more difficult to magnetically align
the grains on the disk scale. Specifically, to produce the observed ${\sim} 1\%$ polarization at
${\sim} 100\,\mathrm{au}$ scale via grains aligned with the B-field, even relatively small grains
of $1\,\mathrm{\mu m}$ in size need to have their magnetic susceptibilities significantly enhanced
(by a factor of ${\sim} 20$) over the standard value, potentially through superparamagnetic inclusions.
This requirement is more stringent for larger grains, with the enhancement factor increasing linearly
with the grain size, reaching ${\sim} 2\times 10^4$ for millimeter-sized grains. Even if the required
enhancement can be achieved, the resulting inferred magnetic field orientation in the simulation
does not show a preference for the major axis, which is inconsistent with the observed pattern. We
thus conclude that the observed trends are best described by the model where the polarization on
the envelope scale is dominated by magnetically aligned grains and that on the disk scale by scattering.

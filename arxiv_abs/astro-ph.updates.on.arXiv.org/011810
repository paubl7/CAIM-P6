We report the discovery of KMT-2020-BLG-0414Lb, with a planet-to-host mass ratio $q_2 = 0.9$--$1.2
\times 10^{-5} = 3$--$4~q_{\oplus}$ at $1\sigma$, which is the lowest mass-ratio microlensing
planet to date. Together with two other recent discoveries ($4 \lesssim q/q_\oplus \lesssim 6$),
it fills out the previous empty sector at the bottom of the triangular $(\log s, \log q)$ diagram,
where $s$ is the planet-host separation in units of the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$.
Hence, these discoveries call into question the existence, or at least the strength, of the break
in the mass-ratio function that was previously suggested to account for the paucity of very low-$q$
planets. Due to the extreme magnification of the event, $A_{\rm max}\sim 1450$ for the underlying
single-lens event, its light curve revealed a second companion with $q_3 \sim 0.05$ and $|\log s_3|
\sim 1$, i.e., a factor $\sim 10$ closer to or farther from the host in projection. The measurements
of the microlens parallax $\pi_{\rm E}$ and the angular Einstein radius $\theta_{\rm E}$ allow
estimates of the host, planet, and second companion masses, $(M_1, M_2, M_3) \sim (0.3M_{\odot},
1.0M_{\oplus}, 17M_{J})$, the planet and second companion projected separations, $(a_{\perp,2},
a_{\perp,3}) \sim (1.5, 0.15~{\rm or}~15)$~au, and system distance $D_{\rm L} \sim 1$ kpc. The
lens could account for most or all of the blended light ($I \sim 19.3$) and so can be studied immediately
with high-resolution photometric and spectroscopic observations that can further clarify the
nature of the system. The planet was found as part of a new program of high-cadence follow-up observations
of high-magnification events. The detection of this planet, despite the considerable difficulties
imposed by Covid-19 (two KMT sites and OGLE were shut down), illustrates the potential utility of
this program.

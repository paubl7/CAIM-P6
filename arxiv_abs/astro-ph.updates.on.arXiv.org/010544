Observations of UV metal absorption lines have provided insight into the structure and composition
of the circumgalactic medium (CGM) around galaxies. We compare these observations with the low-redshift
($z \leq 0.3$) CGM around dwarf galaxies in high-resolution cosmological zoom-in runs in the FIRE-2
simulation suite. We select simulated galaxies that match the halo mass, stellar mass, and redshift
of the observed samples. We produce absorption measurements using Trident for UV transitions of
C IV, O VI, Mg II and Si III. The FIRE equivalent width (EW) distributions and covering fractions for
the C IV ion are broadly consistent with observations inside $0.5 R_{vir}$, but are under-predicted
for O VI, Mg II, and Si III. The absorption strengths of the ions in the CGM are moderately correlated
with the masses and star formation activity of the galaxies. The correlation strengths increase
with the ionization potential of the ions. The structure and composition of the gas from the simulations
exhibit three zones around dwarf galaxies characterized by distinct ion column densities: the
disky ISM, the inner CGM (the wind-dominated regime), and the outer CGM (the IGM accretion-dominated
regime). We find that the outer CGM in the simulations is nearly but not quite supported by thermal
pressure, so it is not in hydrostatic equilibrium (HSE), resulting in halo-scale bulk inflow and
outflow motions. The net gas inflow rates are comparable to the SFR of the galaxy, but the bulk inflow
and outflow rates are greater by an order of magnitude, with velocities comparable to the virial
velocity of the halo. These roughly virial velocities (${\sim} 100 km s^{-1}$) produce large EWs
in the simulations. This supports a picture for dwarf galaxies in which the dynamics of the CGM at
large scales are coupled to the small-scale star formation activity near the centre of their halos.

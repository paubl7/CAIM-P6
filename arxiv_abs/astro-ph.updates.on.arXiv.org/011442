We present \verb|piXedfit|, pixelized spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting, a Python package
that provides tools for analyzing spatially resolved properties of galaxies using multiband imaging
data alone or in combination with integral field spectroscopy (IFS) data. \verb|piXedfit| has
six modules that can handle all tasks in the spatially resolved SED fitting. The SED fitting module
uses the Bayesian inference technique with two kinds of posteriors sampling methods: Markov Chain
Monte Carlo (MCMC) and random densely-sampling of parameter space (RDSPS). We test the performance
of the SED fitting module using mock SEDs of simulated galaxies from IllustrisTNG. The SED fitting
with both posteriors sampling methods can recover physical properties and star formation histories
of the IllustrisTNG galaxies well. We further test the performance of \verb|piXedfit| modules
by analyzing 20 galaxies observed by the CALIFA and MaNGA surveys. The data comprises of 12-band
imaging data from GALEX, SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE, and the IFS data from CALIFA or MaNGA. \verb|piXedfit|
can spatially match (in resolution and sampling) of the imaging and IFS data. By fitting only the
photometric SEDs, \verb|piXedfit| can predict the spectral continuum, $\text{D}_{\rm n}4000$,
$H_{\alpha}$, and $H_{\beta}$ well. The star formation rate (SFR) derived by \verb|piXedfit|
is consistent with that derived from $H_{\alpha}$ emission. The RDSPS method gives equally good
fitting results as the MCMC and it is much faster than the MCMC. \verb|piXedfit| is a versatile tool
equipped with a parallel computing module for efficient analysis of large datasets, and will be
made publicly available (https://github.com/aabdurrouf/piXedfit).

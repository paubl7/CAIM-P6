We analyze relative abundances and ionization conditions in a strong absorption system at z=6.84,
seen in the spectrum of the z=7.54 background quasar ULAS J134208.10+092838.61. Singly ionized
C, Si, Fe, Mg, and Al measurements are consistent with a warm neutral medium that is metal-poor but
not chemically pristine. Firm non-detections of C IV and Si IV imply that any warm ionized phase of
the IGM or CGM has not yet been enriched past the ultra-metal-poor regime (<0.001Z_{solar}), unlike
lower redshift DLAs where these lines are nearly ubiquitous. Relative abundances of the heavy elements
794 Myr after the Big Bang resemble those of metal-poor damped Lyman Alpha systems at intermediate
redshift and Milky Way halo stars, and show no evidence of enhanced [alpha/Fe], [C/Fe] or other signatures
of yields dominated by massive stars. A detection of the CII* fine structure line reveals local sources
of excitation from heating, beyond the level of photo-excitation supplied by the CMB. We estimate
the total and [CII] cooling rates, balancing against ISM heating sources to develop an heuristic
two-phase model of the neutral medium. The implied heating requires a surface density of star formation
slightly exceeding that of the Milky Way but not at the level of a strong starburst. For a typical (assumed)
NHI=10^{20.6}, an abundance of [Fe/H]=-2.2 matches the columns of species in the neutral phase.
To remain undetected in C IV, a warm ionized phase would either need much lower [C/H]<-4.2 over an
absorption path of 1 kpc, or else a very small absorption path (a few pc). While still speculative,
these results suggest a significant reduction in heavy element enrichment outside of neutral star
forming regions of the ISM, as would be expected in early stages of galactic chemical evolution.

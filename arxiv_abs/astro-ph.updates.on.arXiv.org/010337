\textit{Parker Solar Probe} has shown the ubiquitous presence of strong magnetic field deflections,
namely switchbacks, during its first perihelion where it was embedded in a highly Alfv\'enic slow
stream. Here, we study the turbulent magnetic fluctuations around ion scales in three intervals
characterized by a different switchback activity, identified by the behaviour of the magnetic
field radial component, $B_r$. \textit{Quiet} ($B_r$ does not show significant fluctuations),
\textit{weak} ($B_r$ has strong fluctuations but no reversals) and \textit{strong} ($B_r$ has
full reversals) periods show a different behaviour also for ion quantities and Alfv\'enicity.
However, the spectral analysis shows that each stream is characterized by the typical Kolmogorov/Kraichnan
power law in the inertial range, followed by a break around the characteristic ion scales. This frequency
range is characterized by strong intermittent activity, with the presence of non-compressive
coherent structures, such as current sheets and vortex-like structures, and wave packets, identified
as ion cyclotron modes. Although, all these intermittent events have been detected in the three
periods, they have a different influence in each of them. Current sheets are dominant in the \textit{strong}
period, wave packets are the most common in the \textit{quiet} interval; while, in the \textit{weak}
period, a mixture of vortices and wave packets is observed. This work provides an insight into the
heating problem in collisionless plasmas, fitting in the context of the new solar missions, and,
especially for \textit{Solar Orbiter}, which will allow an accurate magnetic connectivity analysis,
to link the presence of different intermittent events to the source region.

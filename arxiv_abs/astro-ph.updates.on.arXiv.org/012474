New observational data of neutron stars since GW170817 have helped improve our knowledge about
nuclear symmetry energy especially at high densities. We have learned particularly: (1) The slope
parameter $L$ of nuclear symmetry energy at saturation density $\rho_0$ of nuclear matter from
24 new analyses is about $L\approx 57.7\pm 19$ MeV at 68\% confidence level consistent with its fiducial
value, (2) The curvature $K_{\rm{sym}}$ from 16 new analyses is about $K_{\rm{sym}}\approx -107\pm
88$ MeV, (3) The magnitude of nuclear symmetry energy at $2\rho_0$, i.e. $E_{\rm{sym}}(2\rho_0)\approx
51\pm 13$ MeV at 68\% confidence level, has been extracted from 9 new analyses of neutron star observables
consistent with results from earlier analyses of heavy-ion reactions and the latest predictions
of the state-of-the-art nuclear many-body theories, (4) while the available data from canonical
neutron stars do not provide tight constraints on nuclear symmetry energy at densities above about
$2\rho_0$, the lower radius boundary $R_{2.01}=12.2$ km from NICER's very recent observation
of PSR J0740+6620 of mass $2.08\pm 0.07$ $M_{\odot}$ and radius $R=12.2-16.3$ km at 68\% confidence
level sets a tight lower limit for nuclear symmetry energy at densities above $2\rho_0$, (5) Bayesian
inferences of nuclear symmetry energy using models encapsulating a first-order hadron-quark
phase transition from observables of canonical neutron stars indicate that the phase transition
shift appreciably both the $L$ and $K_{\rm{sym}}$ to higher values but with larger uncertaintie
, (6) The high-density behavior of nuclear symmetry energy affects significantly the minimum frequency
necessary to rotationally support GW190814's secondary component of mass (2.50-2.67) $M_{\odot}$
as the fastest and most massive pulsar discovered so far.

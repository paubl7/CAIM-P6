Galaxy mergers are traditionally one of the favoured mechanisms for quenching star formation.
To test this paradigm in the context of modern cosmological simulations, we use the IllustrisTNG
simulation to investigate the impact of individual merger events on quenching (i.e. star formation
rate at least 3sig below the star-forming main sequence) within 500Myr after the coalescence phase.The
rate of quenching amongst recently merged galaxies is compared with a control sample that is matched
in redshift, stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR), black hole mass and environment.We find quenching
to be uncommon among the descendants of post-merger galaxies, with only 5% of galaxies quenching
within 500 Myr after the merger.Despite this low absolute rate, we find that quenching occurs in
post-mergers at twice the rate of the control galaxies.The fraction of quenched post-merger descendants
1.5 Gyr after the merger becomes statistically indistinguishable from that of non-post-mergers,
suggesting that mergers could speed up the quenching process in those post-mergers whose progenitors
had physical conditions able to sustain effective active galactic nuclei (AGN) kinetic feedback,
thus capable of removing gas from galaxies.Our results indicate that although quenching does not
commonly occur promptly after coalescence, mergers nonetheless do promote the cessation of star
formation in some post-mergers. We find that, in IllustrisTNG, it is the implementation of the AGN
kinetic feedback that is responsible for quenching post-mergers, as well as non-post-merger controls.As
a result of the released kinetic energy, galaxies experience gas loss and eventually, they will
quench.Galaxies with an initially low gas fraction show a preferable pre-disposition towards
quenching.The primary distinguishing factor between quenched and star-forming galaxies is gas
fraction, with a sharp boundary at fgas=0.1 in TNG.

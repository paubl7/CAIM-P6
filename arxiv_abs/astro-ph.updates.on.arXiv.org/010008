Energetic electrons in the cocoons of radio galaxies make them potential sources for not only radio
and X-rays but also Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) distortions in the cosmic microwave background (CMB)
radiation. Previous works have discussed the energetics of radio galaxy cocoons, but assuming
thermal SZ effect, coming from the non-thermal electron population. We use an improved evolutionary
model for radio galaxy cocoons to estimate the observed parameters such as the radio luminosities
and intensity of SZ-distortions at the redshifts of observation. We, further, quantify the the
effects of various relevant physical parameters of the radio galaxies, such as the jet power, the
time scale over which the jet is active, the evolutionary time scale for the cocoon, etc on the observed
parameters. For current SZ observations towards galaxy clusters, we find that the non-thermal
SZ distortions from radio cocoons embedded in galaxy clusters can be non-negligible compared to
the amount of thermal SZ distortion from the intra-cluster medium and, hence, can not be neglected.
We show that small and young (and preferably residing in a cluster environment) radio galaxies offer
better prospects for the detection of the non-thermal SZ signal from these sources. We further discuss
the limits on different physical parameters for some sources for which SZ effect has been either
detected or upper limits are available. The evolutionary models enable us to obtain limits, previously
unavailable, on the low energy cut-off of electron spectrum ($p_{min} \sim 1\hbox{--}2$) in order
to explain the recent non-thermal SZ detection \citep{MDCMSNW2017}. Finally, we discuss how future
CMB experiments, which would cover higher frequency bands ($>$400 GHz), may provide clear signatures
for non-thermal SZ effect.

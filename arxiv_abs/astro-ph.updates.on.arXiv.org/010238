For a recent intermediate-luminosity transient, AT 2019krl in M74 (NGC 628) at a distance of only
~9.8 Mpc, extensive archival $\textit{Hubble Space Telescope (HST)}$, $\textit{Spitzer Space
Telescope}$, and Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) imaging reveal a bright optical and MIR progenitor
star. A peak was detected in the infrared with an absolute magnitude of $M_{4.5\,\mu {\rm m}} = -18.4$
mag, leading us to infer a visual-wavelength peak absolute magnitude of $-$13.5 to $-$14.5. The
light curve from the pre-discovery archival data indicated no outbursts over the previous 16yr.
The colors, magnitudes, and inferred temperatures of the progenitor best match a 13--14 M$_{\odot}$
yellow or blue supergiant, if only foreground extinction is taken into account, or a hotter and more
massive star, if any additional local extinction is included. A pre-eruption spectrum of the star
reveals strong H$\alpha$ emission having a narrow line core with a width of about 200 km s$^{-1}$
(FWHM) and with wings extending to $\pm$ 2000 km s$^{-1}$. The post-eruption spectrum is fairly
flat and featureless with only H$\alpha$, Na I D, [Ca II], and the Ca II near-infrared triplet in emission,
with very little change in the shape of H$\alpha$ over 120 days. As in many previous intermediate-luminosity
transients, AT 2019krl shows remarkable similarities to both massive luminous blue variable (LBV)
eruptions and SN 2008S-like events. However, in this case, the information about the pre-eruption
star allows us to clearly rule out both a super-AGB star and an electron-capture SN as the origin of
this SN 2008S-like event. Instead, the data favor either a relatively unobscured blue supergiant
(likely viewed pole-on) or a highly extinguished LBV with $M >$ 20 M$_{\odot}$, confirming that
BSGs or LBVs that may undergo mergers are a viable progenitor pathway to produce SN 2008S-like events.

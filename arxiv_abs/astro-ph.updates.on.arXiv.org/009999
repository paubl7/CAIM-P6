High mass X-ray binaries are among the brightest X-ray sources in the Milky Way, as well as in nearby
Galaxies. Thanks to their highly variable emissions and complex phenomenology, they have attracted
the interest of the high energy astrophysical community since the dawn of X-ray Astronomy. In more
recent years, they have challenged our comprehension of physical processes in many more energy
bands, ranging from the infrared to very high energies. In this review, we provide a broad but concise
summary of the physical processes dominating the emission from high mass X-ray binaries across
virtually the whole electromagnetic spectrum. These comprise the interaction of stellar winds
with the high gravitational and magnetic fields of compact objects, the behaviour of matter under
extreme magnetic and gravity conditions, and the perturbation of the massive star evolutionary
processes by presence in a binary system. We highlight the role of the INTEGRAL mission in the discovery
of many of the most interesting objects in the high mass X-ray binary class and its contribution in
reviving the interest for these sources over the past two decades. We show how the INTEGRAL discoveries
have not only contributed to significantly increase the number of high mass X-ray binaries known,
thus advancing our understanding of the population as a whole, but also have opened new windows of
investigation that stimulated the multi-wavelength approach nowadays common in most astrophysical
research fields. We conclude the review by providing an overview of future facilities being planned
from the X-ray to the very high energy domain that will hopefully help us in finding an answer to the
many questions left open after more than 18 years of INTEGRAL scientific observations.

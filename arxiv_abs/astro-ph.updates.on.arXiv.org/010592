The Interface Region Imaging Spectrograph(IRIS) with its high spatial and temporal resolution
brings exceptional plasma diagnostics of solar chromospheric and coronal activity during magnetic
reconnection. The aim of this work is to study the fine structure and dynamics of the plasma at a jet
base forming a mini flare between two emerging magnetic fluxes (EMFs) observed with IRIS and the
Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) instruments. We proceed to a spatio-temporal analysis of IRIS
spectra observed in the spectral ranges of Mg II, C II, and Si IV ions. Doppler velocities from Mg II
lines are computed by using a cloud model technique. Strong asymmetric Mg II and C II line profiles
with extended blue wings observed at the reconnection site (jet base) are interpreted by the presence
of two chromospheric temperature clouds, one explosive cloud with blueshifts at 290 km/s and one
cloud with smaller Dopplershift (around 36 km/s). Simultaneously at the same location (jet base),
strong emission of several transition region lines (e.g. O IV and Si IV), emission of the Mg II triplet
lines of the Balmer-continuum and absorption of identified chromospheric lines in Si IV broad profiles
have been observed and analysed. Such observations of IRIS line and continuum emissions allow us
to propose a stratification model for the white-light mini flare atmosphere with multiple layers
of different temperatures along the line of sight, in a reconnection current sheet. It is the first
time that we could quantify the fast speed (possibly Alfv\'enic flows) of cool clouds ejected perpendicularly
to the jet direction by using the cloud model technique. We conjecture that the ejected clouds come
from plasma which was trapped between the two EMFs before reconnection or be caused by chromospheric-temperature
(cool) upflow material like in a surge, during reconnection

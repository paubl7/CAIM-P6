AM CVn systems are ultra-compact, helium-rich, accreting binaries with degenerate or semi-degenerate
donors. We report the discovery of five new eclipsing AM CVn systems with orbital periods of 61.5,
55.5, 53.3, 37.4, and 35.4 minutes. These systems were discovered by searching for deep eclipses
in the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) lightcurves of white dwarfs selected using Gaia parallaxes.
We obtained phase-resolved spectroscopy to confirm that all systems are AM CVn binaries, and we
obtained high-speed photometry to confirm the eclipse and characterize the systems. The spectra
of two long-period systems (61.5 and 53.3 minutes) show many emission and absorption lines, indicating
the presence of N, O, Na, Mg, Si, and Ca, and also the K and Zn, elements which have never been detected
in AM CVn systems before. By modelling the high-speed photometry, we measured the mass and radius
of the donor star, potentially constraining the evolutionary channel that formed these AM CVn systems.
We determined that the average mass of the accreting white dwarf is $\approx0.8$$\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$,
and that the white dwarfs in long-period systems are hotter than predicted by recently updated theoretical
models. The donors have a high entropy and are a factor of $\approx$ 2 more massive compared to zero-entropy
donors at the same orbital period. The large donor radius is most consistent with He-star progenitors,
although the observed spectral features seem to contradict this. The discovery of 5 new eclipsing
AM~CVn systems is consistent with the known observed AM CVn space density and estimated ZTF recovery
efficiency. Based on this estimate, we expect to find another 1--4 eclipsing AM CVn systems as ZTF
continues to obtain data. This will further increase our understanding of the population, but will
require high precision data to better characterize these 5 systems and any new discoveries.

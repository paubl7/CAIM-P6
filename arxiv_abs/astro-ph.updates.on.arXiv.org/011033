Mars' polar layered deposits (PLD) are comprised of layers of varying dust-to-water ice volume
mixing ratios (VMR) that may record astronomically-forced climatic variation over Mars' recent
orbital history. Retracing the formation of these layers by quantifying the sensitivity of deposition
rates of polar material to astronomical forcing is critical for the interpretation of this record.
Using a Mars global climate model (GCM), we investigate the sensitivity of annual polar water ice
and dust surface deposition to various obliquities and surface water ice distributions at zero
eccentricity, providing a reasonable characterization of the evolution of the PLD during recent
low-eccentricity epochs. For obliquities between 15{\deg} - 35{\deg}, predicted net annual accumulation
rates range from -1 to +14 mm/yr for water ice and from +0.003 to +0.3 mm/yr for dust. GCM-derived rates
are ingested into an integration model that simulates polar accumulation of water ice and dust over
5 consecutive obliquity cycles (~700 kyrs) during a low eccentricity epoch. A subset of integration
simulations predict combined accumulation of water ice and dust in the north at time averaged rates
that are near the observationally-inferred value of 0.5 mm/yr. Three types of layers are produced
per obliquity cycle: a ~30 m-thick dust-rich (~25% dust VMR) layer forms at high obliquity, a ~0.5
m-thick dust lag forms at low obliquity, and two ~10 m-thick dust-poor (~3%) layers form when obliquity
is increasing/decreasing. The ~30 m-thick dust-rich layer is reminiscent of a ~30 m feature derived
from visible imagery analysis the north PLD, while the ~0.5 m-thick dust lag is a factor of ~2 smaller
than observed "thin layers". Overall, this investigation provides further evidence for obliquity
forcing in the PLD climate record, and demonstrates the importance of ice-on-dust nucleation in
polar depositional processes.

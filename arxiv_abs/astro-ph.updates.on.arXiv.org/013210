The large-scale deep underwater Cherenkov neutrino telescopes like Baikal-GVD, ANTARES or KM3NeT,
require calibration and testing methods of their optical modules. These methods usually include
laser-based systems which allow to check the telescope responses to the light and for real-time
monitoring of the optical parameters of water such as absorption and scattering lengths, which
show seasonal changes in natural reservoirs of water. We will present a testing method of a laser
calibration system and a set of dedicated tools developed for Baikal- GVD, which includes a specially
designed and built, compact, portable, and reconfigurable scanning station. This station is adapted
to perform fast quality tests of the underwater laser sets just before their deployment in the telescope
structure, even on ice, without darkroom. The testing procedure includes the energy stability
test of the laser device, 3D scan of the light emission from the diffuser and attenuation test of the
optical elements of the laser calibration system. The test bench consists primarily of an automatic
mechanical scanner with a movable Si detector, beam splitter with a reference Si detector and, optionally,
Q-switched diode-pumped solid-state laser used for laboratory scans of the diffusers. The presented
test bench enables a three-dimensional scan of the light emission from diffusers, which are designed
to obtain the isotropic distribution of photons around the point of emission. The results of the
measurement can be easily shown on a 3D plot immediately after the test and may be also implemented
to a dedicated program simulating photons propagation in water, which allows to check the quality
of the diffuser in the scale of the Baikal-GVD telescope geometry.

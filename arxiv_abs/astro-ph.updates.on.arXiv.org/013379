Context. Radio halos are megaparsec-scale diffuse radio sources{ mostly} located at the centres
of merging galaxy clusters. The common mechanism invoked to explain their origin is the re-acceleration
of relativistic particles caused by large-scale turbulence. Aims. Current re-acceleration models
predict that a significant number of halos at high redshift should be characterised by very steep
spectra ($\alpha<-1.5$) because of increasing inverse Compton energy losses. In this paper, we
investigate the spectral index properties of a sample of nine clusters selected from the second
Planck Sunyaev-Zel'dovich catalogue showing diffuse radio emission with the Low Frequency Array
(LOFAR) in the 120-168 MHz band. This is the first time that radio halos discovered at low frequencies
are followed up at higher frequencies. Methods. We analysed upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope
(uGMRT) observations in Bands 3 and 4, that is, 250-500 and 550-900 MHz respectively. These observations
were combined with existing LOFAR data to obtain information on the spectral properties of the diffuse
radio emission. Results. We find diffuse radio emission in the uGMRT observations for five of the
nine high-$z$ radio halos previously discovered with LOFAR. For those, we measure spectral indices
in the range of $-1$ to $-1.4$. For the uGMRT non-detections, we estimated that the halos should have
a spectral index steeper than $-1.5$. We also confirm the presence of one candidate relic. Conclusions.
Despite the small number of clusters, we find evidence that about half of the massive and merging
clusters at high redshift host radio halos with a very steep spectrum. This is in line with theoretical
predictions, although larger statistical samples are necessary to test models.

In previous works we have derived a Running Vacuum Model (RVM) for a string Universe, which provides
an effective description of the evolution of 4-dimensional string-inspired cosmologies from
inflation till the present epoch. In the context of this "stringy RVM" version, it is assumed that
the early Universe is characterised by purely gravitational degrees of freedom, from the massless
gravitational string multiplet, including the antisymmetric tensor field. The latter plays an
important role, since its dual gives rise to a `stiff' gravitational-axion "matter", which in turn
couples to the gravitational anomaly terms, assumed to be non-trivial at early epochs. In the presence
of primordial gravitational wave (GW) perturbations, such anomalous couplings lead to an RVM-like
dynamical inflation, without external inflatons. We review here this framework and discuss potential
scenarios for the generation of such primordial GW, among which the formation of unstable domain
walls, which eventually collapse in a non-spherical-symmetric manner, giving rise to GW. We also
remark that the same type of "stiff" axionic matter could provide, upon the generation of appropriate
potentials during the post-inflationary eras, (part of) the Dark Matter (DM) in the Universe, which
could well be ultralight, depending on the parameters of the string-inspired model. All in all,
the new (stringy) mechanism for RVM-inflation preserves the basic structure of the original (and
more phenomenological) RVM, as well as its main advantages: namely, a mechanism for graceful exit
and for generating a huge amount of entropy capable of explaining the horizon problem. It also predicts
axionic DM and the existence of mild dynamical Dark Energy (DE) of quintessence type in the present
universe, both being "living fossils" of the inflationary stages of the cosmic evolution.

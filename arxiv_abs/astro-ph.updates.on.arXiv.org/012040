We use X-ray and infrared observations to study the properties of three classes of young stars in
the Carina Nebula: intermediate-mass (2--8M$_\odot$) pre-main sequence stars (IMPS; i.e. intermediate-mass
T Tauri stars), late-B and A stars on the zero-age main sequence (AB), and lower-mass T Tauri stars
(TTS). We divide our sources among these three sub-classifications and further identify disk-bearing
young stellar objects versus diskless sources with no detectable infrared (IR) excess emission
using IR (1--8 $\mu$m) spectral energy distribution modeling. We then perform X-ray spectral fitting
to determine the hydrogen absorbing column density ($N_{\rm H}$), absorption-corrected X-ray
luminosity ($L_{\rm X}$), and coronal plasma temperature ($kT$) for each source. We find that the
X-ray spectra of both IMPS and TTS are characterized by similar $kT$ and $N_{\rm H}$, and on average
$L_{\rm X}$/$L_{\rm bol} \sim4\times10^{-4}$. IMPS are systematically more luminous in X-rays
(by $\sim$0.3 dex) than all other sub-classifications, with median $L_{\rm X} = 2.5\times10^{31}$
erg s$^{-1}$, while AB stars of similar masses have X-ray emission consistent with TTS companions.
These lines of evidence converge on a magneto-coronal flaring source for IMPS X-ray emission, a
scaled-up version of the TTS emission mechanism. IMPS therefore provide powerful probes of isochronal
ages for the first $\sim$10 Myr in the evolution of a massive stellar population, because their intrinsic,
coronal X-ray emission decays rapidly after they commence evolving along radiative tracks. We
suggest that the most luminous (in both X-rays and IR) IMPS could be used to place empirical constraints
on the location of the intermediate-mass stellar birth line.

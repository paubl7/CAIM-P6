We present high signal-to-noise measurements (up to 12$\sigma$) of the average thermal Sunyaev
Zel'dovich (tSZ) effect from optically selected galaxy groups and clusters and estimate their
baryon content within a 2.1$^\prime$ radius aperture. Sources from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
(SDSS) Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) DR15 catalog overlap with 3,700 sq. deg.
of sky observed by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT) from 2008 to 2018 at 150 and 98 GHz (ACT DR5),
and 2,089 sq. deg. of internal linear combination component-separated maps combining ACT and $\it{Planck}$
data (ACT DR4). The corresponding optical depths, $\bar{\tau}$, which depend on the baryon content
of the halos, are estimated using results from cosmological hydrodynamic simulations assuming
an AGN feedback radiative cooling model. We estimate the mean mass of the halos in multiple luminosity
bins, and compare the tSZ-based $\bar{\tau}$ estimates to theoretical predictions of the baryon
content for a Navarro-Frenk-White profile. We do the same for $\bar{\tau}$ estimates extracted
from fits to pairwise baryon momentum measurements of the kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect
(kSZ) for the same data set obtained in a companion paper. We find that the $\bar{\tau}$ estimates
from the tSZ measurements in this work and the kSZ measurements in the companion paper agree within
$1\sigma$ for two out of the three disjoint luminosity bins studied, while they differ by 2-3$\sigma$
in the highest luminosity bin. The optical depth estimates account for one third to all of the theoretically
predicted baryon content in the halos across luminosity bins. Potential systematic uncertainties
are discussed. The tSZ and kSZ measurements provide a step towards empirical Compton-$\bar{y}$-$\bar{\tau}$
relationships to provide new tests of cluster formation and evolution models.

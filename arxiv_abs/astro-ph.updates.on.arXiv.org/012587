Despite numerous attempts, no exomoon has firmly been confirmed to date. New missions like CHEOPS
aim to characterize previously detected exoplanets, and potentially to discover exomoons. In
order to optimize search strategies, we need to determine those planets which are the most likely
to host moons. We investigate the tidal evolution of hypothetical moon orbits in systems consisting
of a star, one planet and one test moon. We study a few specific cases with ten billion years integration
time where the evolution of moon orbits follows one of these three scenarios: (1) "locking", in which
the moon has a stable orbit on a long time scale ($\gtrsim$ 10$^9$ years); (2) "escape scenario" where
the moon leaves the planet's gravitational domain; and (3) "disruption scenario", in which the
moon migrates inwards until it reaches the Roche lobe and becomes disrupted by strong tidal forces.
Applying the model to real cases from an exoplanet catalogue, we study the long-term stability of
moon orbits around known exoplanets. We calculate the survival rate which is the fraction of the
investigated cases when the moon survived around the planet for the full integration time (which
is the age of the star, or if not known, then the age of the Sun).The most important factor determining
the long term survival of an exomoon is the orbital period of the planet. For the majority of the close-in
planets (<10 days orbital periods) there is no stable orbit for moons. Between 10 and 300 days we find
a transition in survival rate from about zero to 70\%. Our results give a possible explanation to
the lack of successful exomoon discoveries for close-in planets. Tidal instability causes moons
to escape or being tidally disrupted around close-in planets which are mostly favoured by current
detection techniques.

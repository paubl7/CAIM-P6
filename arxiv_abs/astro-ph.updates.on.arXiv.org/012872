We propose a novel technique to analyse spacings of the observed CMB temperature angular power spectrum
(APS) motivated by the behaviour of level spacings in the presence or absence of correlations between
eigenvalues of a random matrix. We use data from WMAP 9 year ILC and 2018 Planck maps (Commander, NILC
and SMICA) and estimate minimum, maximum, average spacings and ratios of maximum to minimum spacings
between consecutive multipoles of APS measures ($C_{\ell}$ and $\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{2\pi}C_\ell$).
Anomalous multipole ranges given by $\ell_{max}$ and $\ell_{min}$ exist for multipoles $\in[2,31]$
of this work. Sans parity distinctions, average spacing of $8\leq\ell \leq 31$ for $C_\ell$'s,
and maximum and average spacings of $\ell_{min}\in[8,12]$ of $\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{2\pi}C_\ell$'s
are anomalously low for all maps, with most anomalously low maximum spacing at $99.93\%$ C.L. for
$\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{2\pi}C_\ell\text{ (Planck NILC)}$. With parity distinctions, even multipoles
indicate anomalously low maximum and average spacings relative to odd multipoles, most consistently
for $\ell_{max}\in[6,30]$ of $C_\ell$'s of all maps, the most outstanding being the even multipole
average spacing of $2\leq\ell\leq27$ for $\frac{\ell(\ell+1)}{2\pi}C_\ell\text{ (WMAP)}$,
at $99.60\%$ C.L. For spacing ratios, multipole ranges are similar to those for anomalous spacings,
and odd multipole spacing ratios are mostly anomalous, with odd multipole spacing ratio of $2\leq\ell\leq7$
being consistently low for all maps. Overall, we infer an unusual deficit of correlations between
APS measures and deviations from isotropy due to consistently low, parity-biased anomalous spacings,
which can be argued to have arisen primordially. The physical origin of these findings may be probed
in future work.

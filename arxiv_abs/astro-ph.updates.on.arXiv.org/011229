We present the results of a joint analysis of $Chandra$ X-ray and South Pole Telescope (SPT) SZ observations
targeting the first sample of galaxy clusters at $0.3 < z < 1.3$, selected to be the progenitors of
well-studied nearby clusters based on their expected accretion rate. We develop a new procedure
in order to tackle the analysis challenge that is estimating the intracluster medium (ICM) properties
of low-mass and high-redshift clusters with ${\sim}150$ X-ray counts. One of the dominant sources
of uncertainty on the ICM density profile estimated with a standard X-ray analysis with such shallow
X-ray data is due to the systematic uncertainty associated with the ICM temperature obtained through
the analysis of the background-dominated X-ray spectrum. We show that we can decrease the uncertainty
on the density profile by a factor ${\sim}5$ with a joint deprojection of the X-ray surface brightness
profile measured by $Chandra$ and the SZ integrated Compton parameter available in the SPT cluster
catalog. We apply this technique to the whole sample of 67 clusters in order to track the evolution
of the ICM core density during cluster growth. We confirm that the evolution of the gas density profile
is well modeled by the combination of a fixed core and a self-similarly evolving non-cool core profile.
We show that the fraction of cool-cores in this sample is remarkably stable with redshift although
clusters have gained a factor ${\sim}4$ in total mass over the past ${\sim}9$ Gyr. This new sample
combined with our new X-ray/SZ analysis procedure and extensive multi-wavelength data will allow
us to address fundamental shortcomings in our current understanding of cluster formation and evolution
at $z > 1$.

Interstellar grains are known to be important actors in the formation of interstellar molecules
such as H$_2$, water, ammonia, and methanol. It has been suggested that the so-called interstellar
complex organic molecules (iCOMs) are also formed on the interstellar grain icy surfaces by the
combination of radicals via reactions assumed to have an efficiency equal to unity. In this work,
we aim to investigate the robustness or weakness of this assumption by considering the case of acetaldehyde
(CH$_3$CHO) as a starting study case. In the literature, it has been postulated that acetaldehyde
is formed on the icy surfaces via the combination of HCO and CH$_3$. Here we report new theoretical
computations on the efficiency of its formation. To this end, we coupled quantum chemical calculations
of the energetics and kinetics of the reaction CH$_3$ + HCO, which can lead to the formation of CH$_3$CHO
or CO + CH$_4$. Specifically, we combined reaction kinetics computed with the Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus
(RRKM) theory (tunneling included) method with diffusion and desorption competitive channels.
We provide the results of our computations in the format used by astrochemical models to facilitate
their exploitation. Our new computations indicate that the efficiency of acetaldehyde formation
on the icy surfaces is a complex function of the temperature and, more importantly, of the assumed
diffusion over binding energy ratio $f$ of the CH$_3$ radical. If the ratio $f$ is $\geq$0.4, the
efficiency is equal to unity in the range where the reaction can occur, namely between 12 and 30 K.
However, if $f$ is smaller, the efficiency dramatically crashes: with $f$=0.3, it is at most 0.01.
In addition, the formation of acetaldehyde is always in competition with that of CO + CH$_4$.

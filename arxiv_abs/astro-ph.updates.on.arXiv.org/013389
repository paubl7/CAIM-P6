Supermassive black holes launch highly relativistic jets with velocities reaching Lorentz factors
as high as $\Gamma>50$. How the jets accelerate to such high velocities and where along the jet do
they reach terminal velocity are open questions that are tightly linked to their structure, launching
and dissipation mechanisms. Changes in the beaming factor along the jets could potentially reveal
jet acceleration, deceleration, or bending. We aim to (1) quantify the relativistic effects in
multiple radio frequencies and (2) study possible jet velocity--viewing angle variations at parsec
scales. We used the state-of-the-art code Magnetron to model light curves from the University of
Michigan Radio Observatory and the Mets\"{a}hovi Radio Observatory's monitoring programs in
five frequencies covering about 25 years of observations in the 4.8-37~GHz range for 61 sources.
We supplement our data set with high-frequency radio observations in the 100-340~GHz range from
ALMA, CARMA, and SMA. For each frequency we estimate the Doppler factor which we use to quantify possible
changes in the relativistic effects along the jets. The majority of our sources do not show any statistically
significant difference in their Doppler factor across frequencies. This is consistent with constant
velocity in a conical jet, as expected at parsec scales. However, our analysis reveals 17 sources
where relativistic beaming changes as a function of frequency. In the majority of cases the Doppler
factor increases towards lower frequencies. Only 1253-053 shows the opposite behavior. By exploring
their jet properties we find that the jet of 0420-014 is likely bent across the 4.8-340~GHz range.
For 0212+735 the jet is likely parabolic, and still accelerating in the 4.8-37~GHz range. We discuss
possible interpretations for the trends found in the remaining sources.

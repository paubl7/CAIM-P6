The diversity of Type II supernovae (SNe II) is thought to be driven mainly by differences in their
progenitor's hydrogen-rich (H-rich) envelope mass, with SNe IIP having long plateaus ($\sim100$
days) and the most massive H-rich envelopes. However, it is an ongoing mystery why SNe II with short
plateaus (tens of days) are rarely seen. Here, we present optical/near-infrared photometric and
spectroscopic observations of luminous Type II short-plateau SNe 2006Y, 2006ai, and 2016egz.
Their plateaus of about $50$-$70$ days and luminous optical peaks ($\lesssim-18.4$ mag) indicate
significant pre-explosion mass loss resulting in partially stripped H-rich envelopes and early
circumstellar material (CSM) interaction. We compute a large grid of MESA+STELLA single-star
progenitor and light-curve models with various progenitor zero-age main-sequence (ZAMS) masses,
mass-loss efficiencies, explosion energies, $^{56}$Ni masses, and CSM densities. Our model grid
shows a continuous population of SNe IIP-IIL-IIb-like light-curve morphology in descending order
of H-rich envelope mass. With large $^{56}$Ni masses ($\gtrsim0.05\,M_\odot$), short-plateau
SNe II lie in a confined parameter space as a transitional class between SNe IIL and IIb. For SNe 2006Y,
2006ai, and 2016egz, our findings suggest high-mass red supergiant (RSG) progenitors ($M_{\rm
ZAMS} \simeq 18$-$22\,M_{\odot}$) with small H-rich envelope masses ($M_{\rm H_{\rm env}} \simeq
1.7\,M_{\odot}$) that have experienced enhanced mass loss ($\dot{M} \simeq 10^{-2}\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm
yr}^{-1}$) for the last few decades before the explosion. If high-mass RSGs result in rare short-plateau
SNe II, then these events might ease some of the apparent underrepresentation of higher-luminosity
RSGs in observed SN II progenitor samples.

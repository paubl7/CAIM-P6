OJ 287 is a well-studied binary black hole system, that occasionally exhibits bright X-ray and optical
flares. Here we present a detailed spectral study of its second brightest X-ray flare observed during
2019-2020. Various X-ray instruments were used to capture this historic moment by various PIs programs
(Komossa et al. 2016). In this paper, we reanalyzed the Swift-XRT and UVOT observations. The entire
period is divided into three states, defined as low, intermediate, and high states. The variation
of hardness ratio (HR) with 0.3-10.0 keV integrated flux suggests a "softer-when-brighter" behavior,
as also reported by Komossa et al.(2020a) based on flux-index variations. We proposed a Target of
Opportunity (ToO) observation using AstroSat during the flaring period as it was reported in many
ATels. We have also used the archival data from other X-ray instruments (e.g.Swift-XRT, and NuSTAR).
Simultaneous X-ray spectra observed by various instruments during the high state are very steep
(Komossa et al. 2020a), using Astrosat-SXT and LAXPC we also concluded the same. A significant spectral
change is observed in Astrosat-SXT and LAXPC spectrum which is consistent with Swift-XRT and Nustar
spectrum reported by Komossa et al.(2020a). Together, optical-UV and X-ray spectrum during the
high flux state, suggesting the emergence of a new HBL component. We have modeled the synchrotron
peak with publicly available code GAMERA for the low, intermediate, and high states. Modeling suggests
the need for a high magnetic field to explain the high state under the leptonic scenarios. An increase
in the magnetic field value inside the jet could be linked to the increase in accretion rate as expected
in the BH-disk impact scenario. The color-magnitude diagram reveals a "bluer-when-brighter"
chromatism during the flaring period.

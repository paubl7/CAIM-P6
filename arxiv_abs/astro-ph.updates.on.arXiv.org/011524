Gravitational instabilities can drive small-scale turbulence and large-scale spiral arms in
massive gaseous disks under conditions of slow radiative cooling. These motions affect the observed
disk morphology, its mass accretion rate and variability, and could control the process of planet
formation via dust grain concentration, processing and collisional fragmentation. We study gravito-turbulence
and the associated spiral structures in thin gaseous disks subject to a prescribed cooling law.
We characterize the morphology, coherence and propagation of the spirals, looking out for departures
from viscous disk models. We use the finite-volume code Pluto to integrate the equations of self-gravitating
hydrodynamics in three-dimensional spherical geometry. The gas is cooled over longer-than-orbital
timescales to trigger the gravitational instability and sustain turbulence. We ran models for
various disk masses and cooling rates. In all cases considered, the turbulent gravitational stress
transports angular momentum outward at a rate compatible with viscous disk theory. The dissipation
of orbital energy happens via shocks in spiral density wakes, heating the disk back to a marginally
stable thermal equilibrium. These wakes drive vertical motions and contribute to mix material
from the disk with its corona. They are formed and destroyed intermittently, and they nearly corotate
with the gas at every radius. As a consequence, large-scale spiral arms exhibit no long-term global
coherence and energy thermalization is an essentially local process. In the absence of radial substructures
or tidal forcing, and provided with a local cooling law, gravito-turbulence reduces to a local phenomenon
in thin gaseous disks.

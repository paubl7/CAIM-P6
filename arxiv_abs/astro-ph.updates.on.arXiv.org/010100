We present a first step in developing a benchmark equation-of-state (EoS) model for multi-messenger
astronomy that unifies the thermodynamics of quark and hadronic degrees of freedom. A Lagrangian
approach to the thermodynamic potential of quark-meson-nucleon (QMN) matter was used. In this
approach, dynamical chiral-symmetry breaking is described by the scalar mean-field dynamics
coupled to quarks and nucleons and their chiral partners, whereby its restoration occurs in the
hadronic phase by parity doubling, as well as in the quark phase. Quark confinement was achieved
by an auxiliary scalar field that parametrizes a dynamical infrared cutoff in the quark sector,
serving as an ultraviolet cutoff for the nucleonic phase space. The gap equations were solved for
the isospin-symmetric case, as well as for neutron star (NS) conditions. We also calculated the
mass-radius (MR) relation of NSs and their tidal deformability parameter. The obtained EoS is in
accordance with nuclear matter properties at saturation density and with the flow constraint from
heavy ion collision experiments. For isospin-asymmetric matter, a sequential occurrence of light
quark flavors is obtained, allowing for a mixed phase of chirally-symmetric nucleonic matter with
deconfined down quarks. The MR relations and TDs for compact stars fulfill the constraints from
the latest astrophysical observations for PSR J0740+6620, PSR J0030+0451, and the NS merger GW170817,
whereby the tension between the maximum mass and compactness constraints rather uniquely fixes
the model parameters. The model predicts the existence of stars with a core of chirally restored
but purely hadronic (confined) matter for masses beyond $1.8~M_\odot$. Stars with pure-quark
matter cores are found to be unstable against the gravitational collapse. This instability is shifted
to even higher densities if repulsive interactions between quarks are included.

Using a novel suite of cosmological simulations zooming in on a Mpc-scale intergalactic sheet or
"pancake" at z~3-5, we conduct an in-depth study of the thermal properties and HI content of the warm-hot
intergalactic medium (WHIM) at those redshifts. The simulations span nearly three orders of magnitude
in gas-cell mass, from ~(7.7x10^6-1.5x10^4)Msun, one of the highest resolution simulations of
such a large patch of the inter-galactic medium (IGM) to date. At z~5, a strong accretion shock develops
around the main pancake following a collision between two smaller sheets. Gas in the post-shock
region proceeds to cool rapidly, triggering thermal instabilities and the formation of a multiphase
medium. We find neither the mass, nor the morphology, nor the distribution of HI in the WHIM to be converged
at our highest resolution. Interestingly, the lack of convergence is more severe for the less dense,
more metal-poor, intra-pancake medium (IPM) in between filaments and far from any star-forming
galaxies. As the resolution increases, the IPM develops a shattered structure, with ~kpc scale
clouds containing most of the HI. From our lowest to highest resolution, the covering fraction of
metal-poor (Z<10^{-3}Zsun) Lyman-limit systems (NHI>10^{17.2}/cm^2) in the IPM at z~4 increases
from (3-15)%, while that of Damped Lyman-alpha Absorbers (NHI>10^{20}/cm^2) with similar metallicity
increases threefold, from (0.2-0.6)%, with no sign of convergence. We find that a necessary condition
for the formation of a multiphase, shattered structure is resolving the cooling length, lcool=cs*tcool,
at T~10^5K. If this scale is unresolved, gas "piles up" at these temperatures and cooling to lower
temperatures becomes very inefficient. We conclude that state-of-the-art cosmological simulations
are still unable to resolve the multi-phase structure of the low-density IGM, with potentially
far-reaching implications.

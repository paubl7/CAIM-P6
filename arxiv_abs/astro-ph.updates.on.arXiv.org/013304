Understanding the origins of small-scale flats of CCDs and their wavelength-dependent variations
plays an important role in high-precision photometric, astrometric, and shape measurements of
astronomical objects. Based on the unique flat data of 47 narrow-band filters provided by JPAS-{\it
Pathfinder}, we analyze the variations of small-scale flats as a function of wavelength. We find
moderate variations (from about $1.0\%$ at 390 nm to $0.3\%$ at 890 nm) of small-scale flats among
different filters, increasing towards shorter wavelengths. Small-scale flats of two filters
close in central wavelengths are strongly correlated. We then use a simple physical model to reproduce
the observed variations to a precision of about $\pm 0.14\%$, by considering the variations of charge
collection efficiencies, effective areas and thicknesses between CCD pixels. We find that the
wavelength-dependent variations of small-scale flats of the JPAS-{\it Pathfinder} camera originate
from inhomogeneities of the quantum efficiency (particularly charge collection efficiency)
as well as the effective area and thickness of CCD pixels. The former dominates the variations in
short wavelengths while the latter two dominate at longer wavelengths. The effects on proper flat-fielding
as well as on photometric/flux calibrations for photometric/slit-less spectroscopic surveys
are discussed, particularly in blue filters/wavelengths. We also find that different model parameters
are sensitive to flats of different wavelengths, depending on the relations between the electron
absorption depth, the photon absorption length and the CCD thickness. In order to model the wavelength-dependent
variations of small-scale flats, a small number (around ten) of small-scale flats with well-selected
wavelengths are sufficient to reconstruct small-scale flats in other wavelengths.

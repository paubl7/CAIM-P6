Line intensity mapping (LIM) is a rapidly emerging technique for constraining cosmology and galaxy
formation using multi-frequency, low angular resolution maps. Many LIM applications crucially
rely on cross-correlations of two line intensity maps, or of intensity maps with galaxy surveys
or galaxy/CMB lensing. We present a consistent halo model to predict all these cross-correlations
and enable joint analyses, in 3D redshift-space and for 2D projected maps. We extend the conditional
luminosity function formalism to the multi-line case, to consistently account for correlated
scatter between multiple galaxy line luminosities. This allows us to model the scale-dependent
decorrelation between two line intensity maps, a key input for foreground rejection and for approaches
that estimate auto-spectra from cross-spectra. This also enables LIM cross-correlations to reveal
astrophysical properties of the interstellar medium inacessible with LIM auto-spectra. We expose
the different sources of luminosity scatter or "line noise" in LIM, and clarify their effects on
the 1-halo and galaxy shot noise terms. In particular, we show that the effective number density
of halos can in some cases exceed that of galaxies, counterintuitively. Using observational and
simulation input, we implement this halo model for the H$\alpha$, [Oiii], Lyman-$\alpha$, CO and
[Cii] lines. We encourage observers and simulators to measure galaxy luminosity correlation coefficients
for pairs of lines whenever possible. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/EmmanuelSchaan/HaloGen/tree/LIM
. In a companion paper, we use this halo model formalism and code to highlight the degeneracies between
cosmology and astrophysics in LIM, and to compare the LIM observables to galaxy detection for a number
of surveys.

We present 3-mm observations of the quasar J0015+1842 at z=2.63 with the NOrthern Extended Millimeter
Array (NOEMA). Our data reveals molecular gas, traced via a Gaussian CO(3-2) line, with a remarkably
large velocity dispersion (FWHM=1010+/-120 km/s) and corresponding to a total molecular mass
MH2~(3.4-17)x10^10 Msun, depending on the adopted CO-to-H2 conversion factor alphaCO=(0.8-4.0)
Msun (km/s pc^2)^-1. Assuming the 3-mm continuum emission is thermal, we derive a dust mass of the
order of Mdust ~5x10^8 Msun. J0015+1842 is located in the molecular gas-rich region in the IR vs CO
line luminosity diagram, in-between the main locus of main-sequence and sub-millimetre galaxies
and that of most other AGNs targeted so far for CO measurements. While the large velocity dispersion
of the CO line suggests a merging system, J0015+1842 is observed to be a regular, only very moderately
dust-reddened (Av~0.3-0.4) type-I quasar from its UV-optical spectrum, from which we infer a mass
of the super-massive black hole be around MBH~6x10^8 Msun. We suggest that J0015+1842 is observed
at a galaxy evolutionary stage where a massive merger has brought significant amounts of gas towards
an actively accreting super-massive black hole (quasar). While the host still contains a large
amount of dust and molecular gas with high velocity dispersion, the quasar has already cleared the
way towards the observer, likely through powerful outflows as recently revealed by optical observations
of the same object. High angular resolution observations of this and similar systems} should help
determining better the respective importance of evolution and orientation in the appearance of
quasars and their host galaxies and have the potential to investigate early feedback and star-formation
processes in galaxies in their quasar phases.

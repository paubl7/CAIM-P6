Deciphering the formation of supermassive black holes~(SMBHs) is a key science goal for upcoming
observational facilities. In most theoretical channels proposed so far, the seed formation depends
crucially on local gas conditions. We systematically characterize the impact of a range of gas based
black hole seeding prescriptions on SMBH populations using cosmological simulations. Seeds of
mass $M_{\mathrm{seed}}\sim 10^3-10^{6}~M_{\odot}/h$ are placed in halos that exceed critical
thresholds for star-forming, metal-poor gas mass and halo mass (defined as $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}$
and $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{h}}$, respectively, in units of $M_{\mathrm{seed}}$). We quantify
the impact of these parameters on the properties of $z\geq7$ SMBHs. Lower seed masses produce much
higher BH merger rates (by factors of $\sim10$ and $\sim1000$ at $z\sim7$ and $z\sim15$, respectively).
For fixed seed mass, we find that $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{h}}$ has the strongest impact on the BH population
at high redshift ($z\gtrsim15$, where a factor of 10 increase in $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{h}}$ suppresses
merger rates by $\gtrsim 100$). At lower redshift ($z\lesssim15$), we find that $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}$
has a larger impact on the BH population. Increasing $\tilde{M}_{\mathrm{sf,mp}}$ from $5-150$
suppresses the merger rates by factors of $\sim8$ at $z\sim7-15$. This suggests that the seeding
criteria explored here could leave distinct imprints on the redshift distribution of LISA merger
rates. In contrast, AGN luminosity functions are much less sensitive to seeding criteria, varying
by factors $\lesssim2-3$ within the seed parameters we have explored. Such variations will be challenging
to probe even with future sensitive instruments such as Lynx or JWST. Overall, our systematic parameter
study provides a useful benchmark for development of seed models for large-volume cosmological
simulations.

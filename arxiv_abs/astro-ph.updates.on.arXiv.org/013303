Primordial black holes (PBHs), hypothesized to be the result of density fluctuations during the
early universe, are candidates for dark matter. When microlensing background stars, they cause
a transient apparent enhancement of the flux. Measuring these signals with optical telescopes
is a powerful method to constrain the PBH abundance in the range of $10^{-10}\,M_{\odot}$ to $10^{1}\,M_{\odot}$.
Especially for galactic stars, the finiteness of the sources needs to be taken into account. For
low PBH masses (in this work $\lesssim 10^{-8}\,M_{\odot}$) the average duration of the detectable
event decreases with the mass $\langle t_e\rangle \propto M_{\mathrm{PBH}}$. For $M_{\mathrm{PBH}}\approx
10^{-11}\,M_{\odot}$ we find $\langle t_e\rangle \lesssim\,1 \mathrm{s}$. For this reason,
fast sampling detectors may be required as they could enable the detection of low mass PBHs. Current
limits are set with sampling speeds of 2 minutes to 24 hours in the optical regime. Ground-based Imaging
Atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) are optimized to detect the $\sim$ns long optical Cherenkov
signals induced by atmospheric air showers. As shown recently, the very-large mirror area of these
instruments provides very high signal to noise ratio for fast optical transients ($\ll 1\,$s) such
as asteroid occultations. We investigate whether optical observations by IACTs can contribute
to extending microlensing limits to the unconstrained mass range $M_{\mathrm{PBH}}<10^{-10}M_\odot$.
We discuss the limiting factors to perform these searches for each telescope type. We calculate
the rate of expected detectable microlensing events in the relevant mass range for the current and
next-generation IACTs considering realistic source parameters.

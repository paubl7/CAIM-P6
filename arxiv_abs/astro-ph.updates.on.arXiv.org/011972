In this work, we discuss the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as a tool to advantageously
initialize Stokes profile inversions. To demonstrate the usefulness of CNNs, we concentrate in
this paper on the inversion of LTE Stokes profiles. We use observations taken with the spectropolarimeter
onboard the Hinode spacecraft as a test benchmark. First, we carefully analyze the data with the
SIR inversion code using a given initial atmospheric model. The code provides a set of atmospheric
models that reproduce the observations. These models are then used to train a CNN. Afterwards, the
same data are again inverted with SIR but using the trained CNN to provide the initial guess atmospheric
models for SIR. The CNNs allow us to significantly reduce the number of inversion cycles when used
to compute initial guess model atmospheres, decreasing the computational time for LTE inversions
by a factor of two to four. CNN's alone are much faster than assisted inversions, but the latter are
more robust and accurate. The advantages and limitations of machine learning techniques for estimating
optimum initial atmospheric models for spectral line inversions are discussed. Finally, we describe
a python wrapper for the SIR and DeSIRe codes that allows for the easy setup of parallel inversions.
The assisted inversions can speed up the inversion process, but the efficiency and accuracy of the
inversion results depend strongly on the solar scene and the data used for the CNN training. This
method (assisted inversions) will not obviate the need for analyzing individual events with the
utmost care but will provide solar scientists with a much better opportunity to sample large amounts
of inverted data, which will undoubtedly broaden the physical discovery space.

Neutrino-matter interactions play an important role in core-collapse supernova (CCSN) explosions
as they contribute to both lepton number and/or four-momentum exchange between neutrinos and matter,
and thus act as the agent for neutrino-driven explosions. Due to the multiscale nature of neutrino
transport in CCSN simulations, an implicit treatment of neutrino-matter interactions is desired,
which requires solutions of coupled nonlinear systems in each step of the time integration scheme.
In this paper we design and compare nonlinear iterative solvers for implicit systems with energy
coupling neutrino-matter interactions commonly used in CCSN simulations. Specifically, we consider
electron neutrinos and antineutrinos, which interact with static matter configurations through
the Bruenn~85 opacity set. The implicit systems arise from the discretization of a non-relativistic
two-moment model for neutrino transport, which employs the discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method
for phase-space discretization and an implicit-explicit (IMEX) time integration scheme. In the
context of this DG-IMEX scheme, we propose two approaches to formulate the nonlinear systems --
a coupled approach and a nested approach. For each approach, the resulting systems are solved with
Anderson-accelerated fixed-point iteration and Newton's method. The performance of these four
iterative solvers has been compared on relaxation problems with various degree of collisionality,
as well as proto-neutron star deleptonization problems with several matter profiles adopted from
spherically symmetric CCSN simulations. Numerical results suggest that the nested Anderson-accelerated
fixed-point solver is more efficient than other tested solvers for solving implicit nonlinear
systems with energy coupling neutrino-matter interactions.

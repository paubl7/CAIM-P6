We present a broadband radio study of the transient jets ejected from the black hole candidate X-ray
binary MAXI J1535-571, which underwent a prolonged outburst beginning on 2 September 2017. We monitored
MAXI J1535-571 with the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) at frequencies from 119 to 186 MHz over six
epochs from 20 September to 14 October 2017. The source was quasi-simultaneously observed over
the frequency range 0.84-19 GHz by UTMOST (the upgraded Molonglo Observatory Synthesis Telescope),
the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder, the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA),
and the Australian Long Baseline Array (LBA). Using the LBA observations from 23 September 2017,
we measured the source size to be $34\pm1$ mas. During the brightest radio flare on 21 September 2017,
the source was detected down to 119 MHz by the MWA, and the radio spectrum indicates a turnover between
250 and 500 MHz, which is most likely due to synchrotron self-absorption (SSA). By fitting the radio
spectrum with a SSA model and using the LBA size measurement, we determined various physical parameters
of the jet knot (identified in ATCA data), including the jet opening angle (= $4.5\pm1.2^{\circ}$)
and the magnetic field strength (= $104^{+80}_{-78}$ mG). Our fitted magnetic field strength agrees
reasonably well with that inferred from the standard equipartition approach, suggesting the jet
knot to be close to equipartition. Our study highlights the capabilities of the Australian suite
of radio telescopes to jointly probe radio jets in black hole X-ray binaries (BH-XRBs) via simultaneous
observations over a broad frequency range, and with differing angular resolutions. This suite
allows us to determine the physical properties of XRB jets. Finally, our study emphasizes the potential
contributions that can be made by the low-frequency part of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA-Low)
in the study of BH-XRBs.

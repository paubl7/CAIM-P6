We develop a reliable, fully automatic method for the detection of coronal holes, that provides
consistent full-disk segmentation maps over the full solar cycle and can perform in real-time.
We use a convolutional neural network to identify the boundaries of coronal holes from the seven
EUV channels of the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA) as well as from line-of-sight magnetograms
from the Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager (HMI) onboard the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).
For our primary model (Coronal Hole RecOgnition Neural Network Over multi-Spectral-data; CHRONNOS)
we use a progressively growing network approach that allows for efficient training, provides detailed
segmentation maps and takes relations across the full solar-disk into account. We provide a thorough
evaluation for performance, reliability and consistency by comparing the model results to an independent
manually curated test set. Our model shows good agreement to the manual labels with an intersection-over-union
(IoU) of 0.63. From the total of 261 coronal holes with an area $>1.5\cdot10^{10}$ km$^2$ identified
during the time range 11/2010 - 12/2016, 98.1% were correctly detected by our model. The evaluation
over almost the full solar cycle no. 24 shows that our model provides reliable coronal hole detections,
independent of the level of solar activity. From the direct comparison over short time scales of
days to weeks, we find that our model exceeds human performance in terms of consistency and reliability.
In addition, we train our model to identify coronal holes from each channel separately and show that
the neural network provides the best performance with the combined channel information, but that
coronal hole segmentation maps can be also obtained solely from line-of-sight magnetograms.

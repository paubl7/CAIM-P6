Recent ALMA molecular line observations have revealed 3-D gas velocity structure in protoplanetary
disks, shedding light on mechanisms of disk accretion and structure formation. 1) By carrying out
viscous simulations, we confirm that the disk's velocity structure differs dramatically using
vertical stress profiles from different accretion mechanisms. Thus, kinematic observations
tracing flows at different disk heights can potentially distinguish different accretion mechanisms.
On the other hand, the disk surface density evolution is mostly determined by the vertically integrated
stress. The sharp disk outer edge constrained by recent kinematic observations can be caused by
a radially varying $\alpha$ in the disk. 2) We also study kinematic signatures of a young planet by
carrying out 3-D planet-disk simulations. The relationship between the planet mass and the "kink"
velocity is derived, showing a linear relationship with little dependence on disk viscosity, but
some dependence on disk height when the planet is massive, e.g. $10 M_J$. We predict the "kink" velocities
for the potential planets in DSHARP disks. At the gap edge, the azimuthally-averaged velocities
at different disk heights deviate from the Keplerian velocity at similar amplitudes, and its relationship
with the planet mass is consistent with that in 2-D simulations. After removing the planet, the azimuthally-averaged
velocity barely changes within the viscous timescale, and thus the azimuthally-averaged velocity
structure at the gap edge is due to the gap itself and not directly caused to the planet. Combining
both axisymmetric kinematic observations and the residual "kink" velocity is needed to probe young
planets in protoplanetary disks.

S stars are late-type giants that are transition objects between M-type stars and carbon stars on
the asymptotic giant branch (AGB). They are classified into two types: intrinsic or extrinsic,
based on the presence or absence of technetium (Tc). The Tc-rich or intrinsic S stars are thermally-pulsing
(TP-)AGB stars internally producing s-process elements (including Tc) which are brought to their
surface via the third dredge-up (TDU). Tc-poor or extrinsic S stars gained their s-process overabundances
via accretion of s-process-rich material from an AGB companion which has since turned into a dim
white dwarf. Our goal is to investigate the evolutionary status of Tc-rich S stars by locating them
in a Hertzsprung-Russell (HR) diagram using the results of Gaia early Data Release 3 (EDR3). We combine
the current sample of 13 Tc-rich stars with our previous studies of 10 Tc-rich stars to determine
the observational onset of the TDU in the metallicity range [-0.7; 0]. We also compare our abundance
determinations with dedicated AGB nucleosynthesis predictions. The stellar parameters are derived
using an iterative tool which combines HERMES high-resolution spectra, accurate Gaia EDR3 parallaxes,
stellar evolution models and tailored MARCS model atmospheres for S-type stars. Using these stellar
parameters we determine the heavy-element abundances by line synthesis. In the HR diagram, the
intrinsic S stars are located at higher luminosities than the predicted onset of the TDU. These findings
are consistent with Tc-rich S stars being genuinely TP-AGB stars. The comparison of the derived
s-process abundance profiles of our intrinsic S stars with the nucleosynthesis predictions provide
an overall good agreement. Stars with highest [s/Fe] tend to have the highest C/O ratios.

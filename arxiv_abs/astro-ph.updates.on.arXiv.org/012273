A large fraction of observed protoplanetary disks in nearby Star-Forming Regions (SFRs) are fainter
than expected in CO isotopologue emission. Disks not detected in 13CO line emission are also faint
and often unresolved in the continuum emission at an angular resolution of around 0.2 arcseconds.
Focusing on the Lupus SFR, the aim of this work is to investigate whether the population of CO-faint
disks comprises radially extended and low mass disks - as commonly assumed so far - or if it is of intrinsically
radially compact disks, an interpretation that we propose in this paper. The latter scenario was
already proposed for individual sources or small samples of disks, while this work targets a large
population of disks in a single SFR for which statistical arguments can be made. A new grid of physical-chemical
models of compact disks has been run with DALI in order to cover a region of the parameter space that
had not been explored before with this code. Such models have been compared with 12CO and 13CO ALMA
observations of faint disks in Lupus. Disks that are not detected in 13CO emission and with faint
or undetected 12CO emission are consistent with compact disk models. For radially compact disk,
the emission of CO isotopologues is mostly optically thick and it scales with the surface area: i.e.,
it is fainter for smaller objects. The fraction of compact disks is potentially between roughly
50% and 60% of the entire Lupus sample. Deeper observations of 12CO and 13CO at a moderate angular
resolution will allow us to distinguish whether faint disks are intrinsically compact, or if they
are extended but faint, without the need of resolving them. If the fainter end of the disk population
observed by ALMA disk surveys is consistent with such objects being very compact, this will either
create a tension with viscous spreading or require MHD winds or external processes to truncate the
disks.

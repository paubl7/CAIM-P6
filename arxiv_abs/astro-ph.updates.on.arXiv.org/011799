The $\Lambda$CDM model provides a good fit to a large span of cosmological data but harbors areas
of phenomenology. With the improvement of the number and the accuracy of observations, discrepancies
among key cosmological parameters of the model have emerged. The most statistically significant
tension is the $4-6\sigma$ disagreement between predictions of the Hubble constant $H_0$ by early
time probes with $\Lambda$CDM model, and a number of late time, model-independent determinations
of $H_0$ from local measurements of distances and redshifts. The high precision and consistency
of the data at both ends present strong challenges to the possible solution space and demand a hypothesis
with enough rigor to explain multiple observations--whether these invoke new physics, unexpected
large-scale structures or multiple, unrelated errors. We present a thorough review of the problem,
including a discussion of recent Hubble constant estimates and a summary of the proposed theoretical
solutions. Some of the models presented are formally successful, improving the fit to the data in
light of their additional degrees of freedom, restoring agreement within $1-2\sigma$ between
{\it Planck} 2018, using CMB power spectra data, BAO, Pantheon SN data, and R20, the latest SH0ES
Team measurement of the Hubble constant ($H_0 = 73.2 \pm 1.3{\rm\,km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ at 68\%
confidence level). Reduced tension might not simply come from a change in $H_0$ but also from an increase
in its uncertainty due to degeneracy with additional physics, pointing to the need for additional
probes. While no specific proposal makes a strong case for being highly likely or far better than
all others, solutions involving early or dynamical dark energy, neutrino interactions, interacting
cosmologies, primordial magnetic fields, and modified gravity provide the best options until
a better alternative comes along.[Abridged]

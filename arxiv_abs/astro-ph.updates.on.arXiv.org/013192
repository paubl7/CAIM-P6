Large sub-Neptunes are uncommon around the coolest stars in the Galaxy and are rarer still around
those that are metal-poor. However, owing to the large planet-to-star radius ratio, these planets
are highly suitable for atmospheric study via transmission spectroscopy in the infrared, such
as with JWST. Here we report the discovery and validation of a sub-Neptune orbiting the thick-disk,
mid-M dwarf star TOI-2406. We first infer properties of the host star by analysing the star's near-infrared
spectrum, spectral energy distribution, and Gaia parallax. We use multi-band photometry to confirm
that the transit event is on-target and achromatic, and we statistically validate the TESS signal
as a transiting exoplanet. We then determine physical properties of the planet through global transit
modelling of the TESS and ground-based time-series data. We determine the host to be a metal-poor
M4V star, located at a distance of 56 pc, with a sub-solar metallicity $(\mathrm{[Fe/H] = -0.38 \pm
0.07})$, and a member of the thick disk. The planet is a relatively large sub-Neptune for the M-dwarf
planet population, with $\mathrm{R_p = 2.94 \pm 0.17} \mathrm{R_\oplus}$ and $\mathrm{P = 3.077}$
d, producing transits of 2% depth. We note the orbit has a non-zero eccentricity to 3$\mathrm{\sigma}$,
prompting questions about the dynamical history of the system. This system is an interesting outcome
of planet formation and presents a benchmark for large-planet formation around metal-poor, low-mass
stars. The system warrants further study, in particular radial velocity follow-up to determine
the planet mass and constrain possible bound companions. Furthermore, TOI-2406 b is a good target
for future atmospheric study through transmission spectroscopy, particularly in the category
of warm sub-Neptunes.

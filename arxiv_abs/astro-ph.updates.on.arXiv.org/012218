The mechanism by which the radiation received from obliquely rotating neutron stars is generated
remains an open question half a century after the discovery of pulsars. In contrast, considerable
progress has recently been made in determining the structure of the magnetosphere that surrounds
these objects: numerical computations based on the force-free, magnetohydrodynamic and particle-in-cell
formalisms have now established that the magnetosphere of an oblique rotator entails a current
sheet outside its light cylinder whose rotating distribution pattern moves with linear speeds
exceeding the speed of light in vacuum. Here we insert the description of the current sheet provided
by the numerical simulations in the classical expression for the retarded potential and thereby
calculate the radiation field generated by this source in the time domain. We find a radiation consisting
of highly focused pulses whose (i) spectrum can extend from radio waves to gamma rays, (ii) brightness
temperature can exceed 10^(40) K, (iii) linear polarization can be 100%, (iv) two concurrent polarization
position angles are approximately orthogonal often and swing through 180 deg across the pulse profile
in most cases, (v) circular polarization reverses sense across some components of the pulse profile,
(vi) microstructure is determined by the thickness of the current sheet, and (vii) whose flux density
diminishes with the distance D from the star as D^(-3/2) (rather than D^(-2)) in certain directions.
The intrinsically transient radiation process analysed here is thus capable of generating an emission
whose features are strikingly similar to those of the emissions received from pulsars and magnetars
and from the sources of fast radio bursts and gamma-ray bursts.

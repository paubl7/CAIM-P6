NGC 1232 is a face-on spiral galaxy that serves as an excellent laboratory for the study of star formation
due to its proximity. Recent studies have revealed interesting features about this galaxy: X-ray
observations suggest that it recently collided with a dwarf galaxy, however, no apparent remnant
is observed. Here we search for evidence of this collision. We used long-slit optical spectra in
two different positions obtained with the Goodman spectrograph at the SOAR telescope. We detected
18 HII regions in the north-south direction and 22 HII regions in the east-west direction and a background
galaxy, NGC 1232B, for which we present the first redshift measurement and spectral analysis. We
used the stellar population fitting technique to study the underlying stellar population and to
subtract it from the spectra to measure the emission lines. The emission lines were used to determine
the extinction, electron density, chemical abundance, and the star-formation rate gradient of
NGC 1232. As is common in spiral galaxies, we found a stellar population gradient with older populations
at the central regions and younger ones towards the outskirts, along with a negative oxygen abundance
gradient of -0.16 dex/re. Due to the difficulty of measuring important emission lines, the number
of objects for the abundance gradient is small, but there is a hint that this galaxy has a broken gradient
profile, with a drop towards the center. If the collision caused any disturbance in the galaxy, we
believe it would be small and hard to detect with a limited number of objects. From all the other measurements,
we found no deviations from a typical spiral galaxy and no significant difference between different
directions in the galaxy. The stellar population and emission line analysis of NGC 1232B suggest
that it is a starburst galaxy.

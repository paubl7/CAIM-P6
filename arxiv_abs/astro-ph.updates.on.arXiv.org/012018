The INvestigating Stellar Population In RElics is an on-going project targeting 52 ultra-compact
massive galaxies at 0.1<z<0.5 with the X-Shooter spectrograph (XSH). These objects are the perfect
candidates to be 'relics': massive red-nuggets formed at high-z (z>2) through a short and intense
star formation burst, that evolved passively and undisturbed until the present-day. Relics provide
a unique opportunity to study the mechanisms of star formation at high-z. In this paper, we present
the first INSPIRE Data Release, comprising 19 systems with observations completed in 2020. We use
the methods already presented in the INSPIRE Pilot, but revisiting the 1D spectral extraction.
For these 19 systems, we obtain an estimate of the stellar velocity dispersion, fitting separately
the two UVB and VIS XSH arms at their original resolution. We estimate [Mg/Fe] abundances via line-index
strength and mass-weighted integrated stellar ages and metallicities with full spectral fitting
on the combined spectrum. Ages are generally old, in agreement with the photometric ones, and metallicities
are almost always super-solar, confirming the mass-metallicity relation. The [Mg/Fe] ratio is
also larger than solar for the great majority of the galaxies, as expected. We find that 10 objects
have formed more than 75% of their stellar mass (M*) within 3 Gyr from the Big Bang and classify them
as relics. Among these, we identify 4 galaxies which had already fully assembled their M* by that
time. They are therefore `extreme relics' of the ancient Universe. The INSPIRE DR1 catalogue of
10 known relics to-date augment by a factor of 3.3 the total number of confirmed relics, also enlarging
the redshift window. It is therefore the largest publicly available collection. Thanks to the larger
number of systems, we can also better quantify the existence of a 'degree of relicness', already
hinted at the Pilot Paper.

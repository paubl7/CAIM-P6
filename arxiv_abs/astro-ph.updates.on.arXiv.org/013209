Scintillation of compact radio sources results from the interference between images caused by
multipath propagation, and can be used to probe the intervening scattering plasma and the velocities
of the emitting source and scattering screen. In FRB20201124A, a repeating FRB which recently entered
a period of extreme activity, we obtained many burst detections in observations at the Giant Metrewave
Radio Telescope (GMRT) and the Effelsberg 100m Radio Telescope. Bursts nearby in time show similar
scintillation patterns, and we were able to measure a scintillation timescale by correlating spectra
burst pairs, the first such measurement for an FRB. In addition, we form the 2D autocorrelation function
(ACF) and secondary spectrum of scintillation, the results of which hint towards anisotropic scattering.
The inferred scintillation velocity is $V_{\mathrm{ISS}}\approx (64\pm7) \sqrt{d_{l}/2\,\rm{kpc}}~{\rm
km~s}^{-1}$, higher than Earth's velocity for any screen beyond $d_{l} \gtrsim 400\,$pc. From
the measured scintillation bandwidth, FRB20201124A is underscattered by a factor of $\sim 20$
compared to the NE2001 model predictions, and has comparatively lower scattering than nearby pulsars.
This underscattering, together with the measured scintillation velocity are consistent with
a scattering screen more nearby the Earth at $d_{l} \sim 400\,$pc, rather than at $2\,$kpc spiral
arm which NE2001 predicts to be the dominant source of scattering. With future measurements, the
distance, geometry, and velocity of the scattering screen could be obtained through modelling
of the annual variation in $V_{\rm ISS}$, or through inter-station time delays or VLBI. Scintillation/scattering
measurements of FRBs could help improve Galactic electron density models, particularly in the
Galactic halo or at high Galactic latitudes.

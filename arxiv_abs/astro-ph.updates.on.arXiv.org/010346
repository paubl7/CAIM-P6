In the era of precision cosmology, establishing the correct magnitude of statistical errors in
cosmological parameters is of crucial importance. However, widely used approximations in galaxy
surveys analyses can lead to parameter uncertainties that are grossly mis-estimated, even in a
regime where the theory is well understood (e.g., linear scales). These approximations can be introduced
at three different levels: in the form of the likelihood, in the theoretical modelling of the observable
and in the numerical computation of the observable. Their consequences are important both in data
analysis through e.g., Markov Chain Monte Carlo parameter inference, and when survey instrument
and strategy are designed and their constraining power on cosmological parameters is forecasted,
for instance using Fisher matrix analyses. In this work, considering the galaxy angular power spectrum
as the target observable, we report one example of approximation for each of such three categories:
neglecting off-diagonal terms in the covariance matrix, neglecting cosmic magnification and
using the Limber approximation on large scales. We show that these commonly used approximations
affect the robustness of the analysis and lead, perhaps counter-intuitively, to unacceptably
large mis-estimates of parameters errors (from few~$10\%$ up to few~$100\%$) and correlations.
Furthermore, these approximations might even spoil the benefits of the nascent multi-tracer and
multi-messenger cosmology. Hence we recommend that the type of analysis presented here should
be repeated for every approximation adopted in survey design or data analysis, to quantify how it
may affect the results. To this aim, we have developed \texttt{Multi\_CLASS}, a new extension of
\texttt{CLASS} that includes the angular power spectrum for multiple (galaxy and other tracers
such as gravitational waves) populations.

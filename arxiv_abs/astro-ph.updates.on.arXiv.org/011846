The detection of gravity modes is expected to give us unprecedented insights into the inner dynamics
of the Sun. Within this framework, predicting their amplitudes is essential to guide future observational
strategies and seismic studies. In this work, we predict the amplitude of low-frequency asymptotic
gravity modes generated by penetrative convection at the top of the radiative zone. The result is
found to depend critically on the time evolution of the plumes inside the generation region. Using
a solar model, we compute the GOLF apparent surface radial velocity of low-degree gravity modes
in the frequency range $10~\mu H_z\le \nu \le 100~\mu H_z$. In case of a Gaussian plume time evolution,
gravity modes turn out to be undetectable because of too small surface amplitudes. This holds true
despite a wide range of values considered for the parameters of the model. In the other limiting case
of an exponential time evolution, plumes are expected to drive gravity modes in a much more efficient
way because of a much higher temporal coupling between the plumes and the modes than in the Gaussian
case. Using reasonable values for the plume parameters based on semi-analytical models, the apparent
surface velocities in this case turn out to be one order of magnitude smaller than the 22-years GOLF
detection threshold and than the previous estimates considering turbulent pressure as the driving
mechanism, with a maximum value of $0.05$ cm s${}^{-1}$ for $\ell =1$ and $\nu\approx 100~\mu H_z$.
When accounting for uncertainties on the plume parameters, the apparent surface velocities in
the most favorable plausible case become comparable to those predicted with turbulent pressure,
and the GOLF observation time required for a detection at $ \nu \approx100~\mu H_z$ and $\ell=1$
is reduced to about 50 yrs.

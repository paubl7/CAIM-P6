The remnant phase of a radio galaxy begins when the jets launched from an active galactic nucleus
are switched off. To study the fraction of radio galaxies in a remnant phase, we take advantage of
a $8.31$\,deg$^2$ sub-region of the GAMA~23~field which comprises of surveys covering the frequency
range 0.1--9\,GHz. We present a sample of 104 radio galaxies compiled from observations conducted
by the Murchison Wide-field Array (216\,MHz), the Australia Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder
(887\,MHz), and the Australia Telescope Compact Array (5.5\,GHz). We adopt an `absent radio core'
criterion to identify 10 radio galaxies showing no evidence for an active nucleus. We classify these
as new candidate remnant radio galaxies. Seven of these objects still display compact emitting
regions within the lobes at 5.5\,GHz; at this frequency the emission is short-lived, implying a
recent jet switch-off. On the other hand, only three show evidence of aged lobe plasma by the presence
of an ultra-steep spectrum ($\alpha<-1.2$) and a diffuse, low surface-brightness radio morphology.
The predominant fraction of young remnants is consistent with a rapid fading during the remnant
phase. Within our sample of radio galaxies, our observations constrain the remnant fraction to
$4\%\lesssim f_{\mathrm{rem}} \lesssim 10\%$; the lower limit comes from the limiting case in
which all remnant candidates with hotspots are simply active radio galaxies with faint, undetected
radio cores. Finally, we model the synchrotron spectrum arising from a hotspot to show they can persist
for 5--10\,Myr at 5.5\,GHz after the jets switch off -- radio emission arising from such hotspots
can therefore be expected in an appreciable fraction of genuine remnants.

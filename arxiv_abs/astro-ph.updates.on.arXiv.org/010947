The asymptotic giant branch (AGB) star HR3126, associated with the arcminute-scale bipolar Toby
Jug Nebula, provides a rare opportunity to study the emergence of bipolar structures at the end of
the AGB phase. We carried out long-baseline interferometric observations with AMBER and GRAVITY
(2--2.45 micron) at the Very Large Telescope Interferometer, speckle interferometric observations
with VLT/NACO (2.24 micron), and imaging with SPHERE-ZIMPOL (0.55 micron) and VISIR (7.9--19.5
micron). The images reconstructed in the continuum at 2.1--2.29 micron from the AMBER+GRAVITY
data reveal the central star surrounded by an elliptical ring-like structure with a semimajor and
semiminor axis of 5.3 and 3.5 mas, respectively. The ring is interpreted as the inner rim of an equatorial
dust disk viewed from an inclination angle of ~50 degrees, and its axis is approximately aligned
with the bipolar nebula. The disk is surprisingly compact, with an inner radius of a mere 3.5 Rstar
(2 au). Our 2-D radiative transfer modeling shows that an optically thick flared disk with silicate
grains as large as ~4 micron can reproduce the observed continuum images and the spectral energy
distribution. The images obtained in the CO first overtone bands reveal elongated extended emission
around the central star, suggesting the oblateness of the star's atmosphere or the presence of a
CO gas disk inside the dust cavity. The object is unresolved with SPHERE-ZIMPOL, NACO, and VISIR.
If the disk formed together with the bipolar nebula, the grain growth from sub-micron to a few microns
should have taken place over the nebula's dynamical age of ~3900 yrs. The non-detection of a companion
in the reconstructed images implies that either its 2.2 micron brightness is more than ~30 times
lower than that of the red giant or it might have been shredded due to binary interaction.

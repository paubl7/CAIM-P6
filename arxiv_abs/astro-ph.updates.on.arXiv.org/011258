The observed features of the radio sources indicate complex propagation effects embedded in the
waves of solar radio bursts. In this work, we perform ray-tracing simulations on radio wave transport
in the corona and interplanetary region with anisotropic electron density fluctuations. For the
first time, the variation of the apparent source size, burst duration, and source position of both
fundamental emission and harmonic emission at frequency 35 MHz are simulated as the function of
the anisotropic parameter $\alpha$ and the angular scattering rate coefficient $\eta =\epsilon^2/h_0$,
where $\epsilon^2={\langle \delta n^2\rangle}/{n^2}$ is the density fluctuation level and $h_0$
is its correlation length near the wave exciting site. It is found that isotropic fluctuations produce
a much larger decay time than a highly anisotropic fluctuation for fundamental emission. By comparing
the observed duration and source size with the simulation results in the parameter space, we can
estimate the scattering coefficient and the anisotropy parameter $\eta = 8.9\times 10^{-5}\,
\mathrm{km^{-1}}$ and $\alpha = 0.719$ with point pulse source assumption. Position offsets due
to wave scattering and refraction can produce the co-spatial of fundamental and harmonic waves
in observations of some type III radio bursts. The visual speed due to the wave propagation effect
can reach 1.5\,$c$ for $\eta = 2.4\times 10^{-4}\, \mathrm{km^{-1}}$ and $\alpha=0.2$ for fundamental
emission in the sky plane, accompanying with large expansion rate of the source size. The visual
speed direction is mostly identical to the offset direction, thus, for the observation aiming at
obtaining the source position, the source centroid at the starting point is closer to the wave excitation
point.

We use a simulation-based modelling approach to analyse the anisotropic clustering of the BOSS
LOWZ sample over the radial range $0.4 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$ to $63 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$,
significantly extending what is possible with a purely analytic modelling framework. Our full-scale
analysis yields constraints on the growth of structure that are a factor of two more stringent than
any other study on large scales at similar redshifts. We infer $f \sigma_8 = 0.471 \pm 0.024$ at $z
\approx 0.25$, and $f \sigma_8 = 0.431 \pm 0.025$ at $z \approx 0.40$; the corresponding $\Lambda$CDM
predictions of the Planck CMB analysis are $0.470 \pm 0.006$ and $0.476 \pm 0.005$, respectively.
Our results are thus consistent with Planck, but also follow the trend seen in previous low-redshift
measurements of $f \sigma_8$ falling slightly below the $\Lambda$CDM+CMB prediction. We find
that small and large radial scales yield mutually consistent values of $f \sigma_8$, but there are
$1-2.5 \sigma$ hints of small scales ($< 10 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$) preferring lower values
for $f \sigma_8$ relative to larger scales. We analyse the constraining power of the full range of
radial scales, finding that most of the multipole information about $f\sigma_8$ is contained in
the scales $2 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc} \lesssim s \lesssim 20 \, h^{-1} \, \mathrm{Mpc}$. Evidently,
once the cosmological information of the quasi-to-nonlinear regime has been harvested, large-scale
modes contain only modest additional information about structure growth. Finally, we compare
predictions for the galaxy-galaxy lensing amplitude of the two samples against measurements from
SDSS and assess the lensing-is-low effect in light of our findings.

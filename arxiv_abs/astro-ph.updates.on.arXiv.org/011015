We develop a cosmological model for the evolution of dust grains in galaxies with a distribution
of sizes in order to understand the origin of the Milky Way dust extinction curve. Our model considers
the formation of active dust in evolved stars, growth by accretion and coagulation, and destruction
processes via shattering, sputtering, and astration in the ISM of galaxies over cosmic time. Our
main results follow. Galaxies in our cosmological model with masses comparable to the Milky Way's
at z~0 exhibit a diverse range of extinction laws, though with slopes and bump strengths comparable
to the range observed in the Galaxy. The progenitors of the Milky Way have steeper slopes, and only
flatten to slopes comparable to the Galaxy at $z \approx 1$. This owes to increased grain growth rates
at late times/in high-metallicity environments driving up the ratio of large to small grains, with
a secondary dependence on the graphite to silicate ratio evolution. The UV bump strengths depend
primarily on the graphite to silicate ratio, and remain broadly constant in MW-like galaxies between
z=3 and z=0, though show slight variability. Our models span comparable regions of bump-slope space
as sightlines in the Galaxy do, though there is a lack of clear relationship between the model slopes
and bump strengths owing to small scale fluctuations in the bump strength. Our models naturally
produce slopes for some non-Milky Way analogs as steep as those of the LMC and SMC in metal poor galaxies,
though notably the bump strengths are, on average, too large when comparing to the Magellanic clouds.
This owes to the fact that we evolve the grain size distributions of graphites and silicates simultaneously,
which is an oversimplification. Our model provides a novel framework to study the origins and variations
of dust extinction curves in galaxies over cosmic time.

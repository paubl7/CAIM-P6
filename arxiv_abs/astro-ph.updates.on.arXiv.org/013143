The merger of two or more galaxies can enhance the inflow of material from galactic scales into the
close environments of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), obscuring and feeding the supermassive black
hole (SMBH). Both recent simulations and observations of AGN in mergers have confirmed that mergers
are related to strong nuclear obscuration. However, it is still unclear how AGN obscuration evolves
in the last phases of the merger process. We study a sample of 60 Luminous and Ultra-luminous IR galaxies
(U/LIRGs) from the GOALS sample observed by NuSTAR. We find that the fraction of AGN that are Compton-thick
(CT; $N_{\rm H}\geq 10^{24}\rm\,cm^{-2}$) peaks at $74_{-19}^{+14}\%$ at a late merger stage,
prior to coalescence, when the nuclei have projected separations of $d_{\rm sep}\sim 0.4-6$ kpc.
A similar peak is also observed in the median $N_{\rm H}$ [$(1.6\pm0.5)\times10^{24}\rm\,cm^{-2}$].
The vast majority ($85^{+7}_{-9}\%$) of the AGN in the final merger stages ($d_{\rm sep}\lesssim
10$ kpc) are heavily obscured ($N_{\rm H}\geq 10^{23}\rm\,cm^{-2}$), and the median $N_{\rm H}$
of the accreting SMBHs in our sample is systematically higher than that of local hard X-ray selected
AGN, regardless of the merger stage. This implies that these objects have very obscured nuclear
environments, with the $N_{\rm H}\geq 10^{23}\rm\,cm^{-2}$ gas almost completely covering the
AGN in late mergers. CT AGN tend to have systematically higher absorption-corrected X-ray luminosities
than less obscured sources. This could either be due to an evolutionary effect, with more obscured
sources accreting more rapidly because they have more gas available in their surroundings, or to
a selection bias. The latter scenario would imply that we are still missing a large fraction of heavily
obscured, lower luminosity ($L_{2-10}\lesssim 10^{43}\rm\,erg\,s^{-1}$) AGN in U/LIRGs.

Galaxies can be classified as passive ellipticals or star-forming discs. Ellipticals dominate
at the high end of the mass range, and therefore there must be a mechanism responsible for the quenching
of star-forming galaxies. This could either be due to the secular processes linked to the mass and
star formation of galaxies or to external processes linked to the surrounding environment. In this
paper, we analytically model the processes that govern galaxy evolution and quantify their contribution.
We have specifically studied the effects of mass quenching, gas stripping, and mergers on galaxy
quenching. To achieve this, we first assumed a set of differential equations that describe the processes
that shape galaxy evolution. We then modelled the parameters of these equations by maximising likelihood.
These equations describe the evolution of galaxies individually, but the parameters of the equations
are constrained by matching the extrapolated intermediate-redshift galaxies with the low-redshift
galaxy population. In this study, we modelled the processes that change star formation and stellar
mass in massive galaxies from the GAMA survey between z~0.4 and the present. We identified and quantified
the contributions from mass quenching, gas stripping, and mergers to galaxy quenching. The quenching
timescale is on average 1.2 Gyr and a closer look reveals support for the slow-then-rapid quenching
scenario. The major merging rate of galaxies is about once per 10~Gyr, while the rate of ram pressure
stripping is significantly higher. In galaxies with decreasing star formation, we show that star
formation is lost to fast quenching mechanisms such as ram pressure stripping and is countered by
mergers, at a rate of about 41% Gyr$^{-1}$ and to mass quenching 49% Gyr$^{-1}$. (abridged)

We investigate radiation hardness within a representative sample of 67 nearby (0.02 $\lesssim
$z$ \lesssim$0.06) star-forming (SF) galaxies using the integral field spectroscopic data from
the MaNGA survey. The softness parameter $\eta$ = $\frac{O^{+}/O^{2+}}{S^{+}/S^{2+}}$ is sensitive
to the spectral energy distribution of the ionizing radiation. We study $\eta$ via the observable
quantity $\eta\prime$ (=$\frac{[OII]/[OIII]}{[SII][SIII]}$) We analyse the relation between
radiation hardness (traced by $\eta$ and $\eta\prime$) and diagnostics sensitive to gas-phase
metallicity, electron temperature, density, ionization parameter, effective temperature and
age of ionizing populations. It is evident that low metallicity is accompanied by low log $\eta\prime$,
i.e. hard radiation field. No direct relation is found between radiation hardness and other nebular
parameters though such relations can not be ruled out. We provide empirical relations between log
$\rm\eta$ and strong emission line ratios N$_2$, O$_3$N$_2$ and Ar$_3$O$_3$ which will allow future
studies of radiation hardness in SF galaxies where weak auroral lines are undetected. We compare
the variation of [O III]/[O II] and [S III]/[S II] for MaNGA data with SF galaxies and H II regions within
spiral galaxies from literature, and find that the similarity and differences between different
data set is mainly due to the metallicity. We find that predictions from photoionizaion models considering
young and evolved stellar populations as ionizing sources in good agreement with the MaNGA data.
This comparison also suggests that hard radiation fields from hot and old low-mass stars within
or around SF regions might significantly contribute to the observed $\eta$ values.

Luminous Blue Variables (LBVs) are hot, very luminous massive stars displaying large quasi-periodic
variations in brightness, radius,and photospheric temperature, on timescales of years to decades.
The physical origin of this variability, called S Doradus cycle after its prototype, has remained
elusive. Here, we study the feedback of stellar wind mass-loss on the envelope structure in stars
near the Eddington limit. We perform a time-dependent hydrodynamic stellar evolutionary calculation,
applying a stellar wind mass-loss prescription with a temperature-dependence inspired by the
predicted systematic increase in mass-loss rates below 25 kK. We find that when the wind mass-loss
rate crosses a well-defined threshold, a discontinuous change in the wind base conditions leads
to a restructuring of the stellar envelope. The induced drastic radius and temperature changes,
which occur on the thermal timescale of the inflated envelope, impose in turn mass-loss variations
that reverse the initial changes, leading to a cycle that lacks a stationary equilibrium configuration.
Our proof-of-concept model broadly reproduces the typical observational phenomenology of the
S Doradus variability. We identify three key physical ingredients needed to trigger the instability:
inflated envelopes in close proximity to the Eddington limit, a temperature range where decreasing
opacities do not lead to an accelerating outflow, and a mass-loss rate that increases with decreasing
temperature, crossing a critical threshold value within this temperature range. Our scenario
and model provide testable predictions, and open the door for a consistent theoretical treatment
of the LBV phase in stellar evolution, with consequences for their further evolution as single stars
or in binary systems.

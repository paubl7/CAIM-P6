The propagation path of gravitational waves is expected to be bent near massive astrophysical objects.
The massive object acts as a lens. Similarly to the lensing of electromagnetic waves, the lens amplifies
gravitational waves' amplitude and can produce multiple gravitational-wave images. If we suppose
the positions of lens and source of a gravitational wave deviate from the line of sight, the gravitational-wave
images arrive at different times because they have traveled different trajectories around the
lens at the same speed. Depending on the difference in their arrival times, multiple gravitational
waves can be detected as repeated, near-identical events, or superposed gravitational waves with
characteristic "beating patterns". In particular, when the lens is small, $\lesssim 10^5 M_\odot$,
the lens produces images with short time delays that result in the beating patterns. We utilize deep
learning to study the lensing signature. It is known that many state-of-the-art deep learning models
are excellent at recognizing foreground images, similar to spectrograms, from background noises.
In this work, we study the feasibility of applying deep learning to identify lensing signatures
from the spectrogram of gravitational-wave signals detectable by the Advanced LIGO and Virgo detectors.
We assume the lens mass is around $10^3 M_\odot$ -- $10^5 M_\odot$ which can produce the order of millisecond
time delays between two images of lensed gravitational waves. We discuss the feasibility of two
aspects: distinguishing lensed gravitational waves from unlensed ones and estimating the parameters
related to not only the lensing factor but also the source binary system and lens. We suggest that
the approach of this work would be of particular interest for more complicated lensings for which
we do not have accurate waveform templates.

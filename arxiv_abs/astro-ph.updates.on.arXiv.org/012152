Stars with an initial mass of $\sim 7$-11 solar masses form degenerate oxygen-neon cores following
carbon burning. Electron captures in such cores can trigger runaway oxygen burning, resulting
in either a collapse or a thermonuclear explosion. We provide a detailed description of the formalism
used in previous work and apply it to two further forbidden transitions that are relevant to degenerate
oxygen-neon cores: the $4^+_\text{g.s.}\rightarrow{}2^+_1$ transition in $^{24}\text{Na}(e^-,\nu_e)^{24}\text{Ne}$
and the ${5/2^+_{\text{g.s.}} \rightarrow{} 1/2^+_{\text{g.s.}}}$ transition in $^{27}\text{Al}(e^-,\nu_e)^{27}\text{Mg}$.
The relevant nuclear matrix elements are determined through shell model calculations and constraints
from CVC theory. We then investigate the astrophysical impact using the stellar evolution code
MESA and through timescale arguments. In the relevant temperature range, the forbidden transitions
substantially reduce the threshold densities for $^{24}\text{Na}(e^-,\nu_e)^{24}\text{Ne}$
and $^{27}\text{Al}(e^-,\nu_e)^{27}\text{Mg}$. In the MESA models, $^{24}\text{Na}(e^-,\nu_e)^{24}\text{Ne}$
now occurs immediately following the onset of $^{24}\text{Mg}(e^-,\nu_e)^{24}\text{Na}$.
The impact on the overall evolution is uncertain: this is due to known difficulties in accounting
for convective instabilities triggered by the $A=24$ electron captures. The transition between
$^{27}\text{Al}$ and $^{27}\text{Mg}$ may have a minor effect on the early evolution but is unlikely
to affect the outcome. The studied transitions should be included when calculating weak interaction
rates between $^{24}$Na and $^{24}$Ne for temperatures $\log_{10}(T[\text{K}])\lesssim8.5$
and between $^{27}$Al and $^{27}$Mg for $\log_{10}(T[\text{K}])\lesssim8.8$.

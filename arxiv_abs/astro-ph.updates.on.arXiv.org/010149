Aims: Our goal is to investigate how the strength of episodic accretion bursts depends on eccentricity.
Methods: We investigate the binary trigger hypothesis in longer-period (>20yr) binaries by carrying
out three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamical (MHD) simulations of the formation of low-mass
binary stars down to final separations of $\sim$10$\au$, including the effects of gas turbulence
and magnetic fields. We ran two simulations with an initial turbulent gas core of one solar mass each
and two different initial turbulent Mach numbers, M = 0.1 and M=0.2, for 6500yr after protostar formation.
Results: We observe bursts of accretion at periastron during the early stages when the eccentricity
of the binary system is still high. We find that this correlation between bursts of accretion and
passing periastron breaks down at later stages because of the gradual circularisation of the orbits.
For eccentricities greater than e=0.2, we observe episodic accretion triggered near periastron.
However, we do not find any strong correlation between the strength of episodic accretion and eccentricity.
The strength of accretion is defined as the ratio of the burst accretion rate to the quiescent accretion
rate.We determine that accretion events are likely triggered by torques between the rotation of
the circumstellar disc and the approaching binary stars. We compare our results with observational
data of episodic accretion in short-period binaries and find good agreement between our simulations
and the observations. Conclusions: We conclude that episodic accretion is a universal mechanism
operating in eccentric young binary-star systems, independent of separation, and it should be
observable in long-period binaries as well as in short-period binaries. Nevertheless, the strength
depends on the torques and hence the separation at periastron.

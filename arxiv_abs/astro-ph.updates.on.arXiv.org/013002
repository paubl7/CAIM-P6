The CARMENES exoplanet survey of M dwarfs has obtained more than 18 000 spectra of 329 nearby M dwarfs
over the past five years as part of its guaranteed time observations (GTO) program. We determine
planet occurrence rates with the 71 stars from the GTO program for which we have more than 50 observations.
We use injection-and-retrieval experiments on the radial-velocity (RV) time series to measure
detection probabilities. We include 27 planets in 21 planetary systems in our analysis. We find
0.06+0.04-0.03 giant planets (100 M_Earth < M_pl sin i < 1000 M_Earth) per star in periods of up to
1000 d, but due to a selection bias this number could be up to a factor of five lower in the whole 329-star
sample. The upper limit for hot Jupiters (orbital period of less than 10 d) is 0.03 planets per star,
while the occurrence rate of planets with intermediate masses (10 M_Earth < M_pl sin i < 100 M_Earth)
is 0.18+0.07-0.05 planets per star. Less massive planets with 1 M_Earth < M_pl sin i < 10 M_Earth are
very abundant, with an estimated rate of 1.32+0.33-0.31 planets per star for periods of up to 100
d. When considering only late M dwarfs with masses M_star < 0.34 M_sol, planets more massive than
10 M_Earth become rare. Instead, low-mass planets with periods shorter than 10 d are significantly
overabundant. For orbital periods shorter than 100 d, our results confirm the known stellar mass
dependences from the Kepler survey: M dwarfs host fewer giant planets and at least two times more
planets with M_pl sin i < 10 M_Earth than G-type stars. In contrast to previous results, planets around
our sample of very low-mass stars have a higher occurrence rate in short-period orbits of less than
10 d. Our results demonstrate the need to take into account host star masses in planet formation models.

The space-borne missions CoRoT and Kepler opened up a new opportunity for better understanding
stellar evolution by probing stellar interiors with unrivalled high-precision photometric data.
Kepler has observed stellar oscillation for four years, which gave access to excellent frequency
resolution that enables deciphering the oscillation spectrum of evolved red giant branch and asymptotic
giant branch stars. The internal structure of stars in the upper parts of the red and asymptotic giant
branches is poorly constrained, which makes the distinction between red and asymptotic giants
difficult. We perform a thorough seismic analysis to address the physical conditions inside these
stars and to distinguish them. We studied the oscillation mode properties of about 2.000 evolved
giants in a model described by the asymptotic pressure-mode pattern of red giants, which includes
the signature of the helium second-ionisation zone. We extracted the mode properties up to the degree
l = 3 and investigated their dependence on stellar mass, metallicity, and evolutionary status.
We identify a clear difference in the signature of the helium second-ionisation zone between red
and asymptotic giants. We also detect a clear shortage of the energy of l = 1 modes after the core-He-burning
phase. Furthermore, we note that the mode damping observed on the asymptotic giant branch is similar
to that observed on the red giant branch. We highlight that the signature of the helium second-ionisation
zone varies with stellar evolution. This provides us with a physical basis for distinguishing red
giant branch stars from asymptotic giants. Here, our investigation of stellar oscillations allows
us to constrain the physical processes and the key events that occur during the advanced stages of
stellar evolution, with emphasis on the ascent along the asymptotic giant branch, including the
asymptotic giant branch bump.

We present a compendium of disk galaxy scaling relations and a detailed characterization of their
intrinsic scatter. Observed scaling relations are typically characterized by their slope, intercept,
and scatter; however, these parameters are a mixture of observational errors and astrophysical
processes. We introduce a novel Bayesian framework for computing the intrinsic scatter of scaling
relations that accounts for nonlinear error propagation and covariant uncertainties. Bayesian
intrinsic scatters are ~25percent more accurate than those obtained with a first-order classical
method, which systematically underestimates the true intrinsic scatter. Structural galaxy scaling
relations based on velocity (V23.5), size (R23.5), luminosity (L23.5), colour (g-z), central
stellar surface density (Sigma1), stellar mass (M*), dynamical mass (Mdyn), stellar angular momentum
(j*), and dynamical angular momentum (jdyn), are examined to demonstrate the power and importance
of the Bayesian formalism. Our analysis is based on a diverse selection of over 1000 late-type galaxies
from the Photometry and Rotation Curve Observations from Extragalactic Surveys compilation with
deep optical photometry and extended rotation curves. We determine the tightest relation for each
parameter by intrinsic orthogonal scatter, finding M*-V23.5, R23.5-j*, and L23.5-jdyn to be especially
tight. The scatter of the R23.5-L23.5, V23.5-(g-z), and R23.5-jdyn relations is mostly intrinsic,
making them ideal for galaxy formation and evolutionary studies. Our code to compute the Bayesian
intrinsic scatter of any scaling relation is also presented. We quantify the correlated nature
of many uncertainties in galaxy scaling relations and scrutinize the uncertain nature of disk inclination
corrections and their effect on scatter estimates.

The quiet solar corona consists of a myriad of loop-like features with magnetic fields originating
from network and internetwork regions on the solar surface. Based on HRTS, Yohkoh, SOHO, and TRACE
observations, there is a rich literature on a variety of such burst phenomena in the solar atmosphere.
However, it remains unclear whether such transients, mostly observed in the extreme ultraviolet
(EUV), play a significant role in atmospheric heating. We revisit the issue of these bursts as a prelude
to the new high resolution EUV imagery expected from the recently launched Solar Orbiter. We use
EUV images recorded by the SDO/AIA to investigate statistical properties of the bursts. We detect
the bursts in the 171 {\AA} filter images of AIA in an automated way through a pixel-wise analysis
by imposing different intensity thresholds. By exploiting the high cadence (12 s) of the AIA observations,
we find that the distribution of lifetime of these events peaks at about 120 s, nevertheless, there
are a significant number of events also at timescales shorter than 60 s. The sizes of the detected
bursts are limited by the spatial resolution, hinting at a larger number of hidden events in the AIA
data. We estimate that there appear about 100 new bursts per second on the whole Sun. The detected
bursts have nanoflare-like energies of $10^{24}$ erg per event. Based on this we estimate that at
least 100 times more events of similar nature would be required to account for energy required to
heat the corona. Thus, considering AIA observations alone, the EUV bursts discussed here have no
significant role in the quiet-Sun coronal heating. If the quiet-Sun coronal heating is mainly bursty,
then the high-resolution EUV observations from the Solar Orbiter may be able to reduce, at least
partly, the deficit in the number of EUV bursts seen with SDO/AIA, by detecting more such events.

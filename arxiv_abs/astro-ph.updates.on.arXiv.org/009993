UCAC2 46706450 is a late-type star with an ultraviolet (UV) excess. It was considered a candidate
to establish a sample of FGK stars with white dwarf (WD) companions that can be used to test binary
evolution models. To verify the WD nature of the companion, UV spectroscopy was performed by Parsons
et al. (2016). By a detailed model-atmosphere analysis we show that the UV source is an extremely
hot WD with effective temperature $T_\mathrm{eff}$ = $105\,000\pm5000$ K, mass $M/M_\odot = 0.54\pm0.02$,
radius $R/R_\odot = 0.040^{+0.005}_{-0.004}$, and luminosity $L/L_\odot= 176^{+55}_{-49}$,
i.e., the compact object is just about to enter the WD cooling sequence. Investigating spectra of
the cool star ($T_\mathrm{eff}$ = $4945\pm250$ K) we found that it is a K-type subgiant with $M/M_\odot
= 0.8-2.4$, $R/R_\odot = 5.9^{+0.7}_{-0.5}$, and $L/L_\odot= 19^{+5}_{-5}$, that is rapidly
rotating with $v \sin(i)=81$ km s$^{-1}$. Optical light curves reveal a period of two days and an
o-band peak-to-peak amplitude of 0.06 mag. We suggest, that it is caused by stellar rotation in connection
with star spots. With the radius we infer an extremely high rotational velocity of $v_{\mathrm{rot}}=151^{+18}_{-13}$
km s$^{-1}$, thus marking the star as one of the most rapidly rotating subgiants known. This explains
chromospheric activity observed by H$\alpha$ emission and emission-line cores in CaII H and K as
well as NUV flux excess. From equal and constant radial velocities of the WD and the K subgiant as well
as from a fit to the spectral energy distribution we infer that they form a physical, wide though unresolved
binary system. Both components exhibit similar metal abundances and show iron-group elements
with slightly oversolar (up to 0.6 dex) abundance, meaning that atomic diffusion in the WD atmosphere
is not yet active due to a residual, weak radiation-driven wind. (abridged)

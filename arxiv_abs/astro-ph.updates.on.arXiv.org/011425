The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) will soon provide the first high-resolution images of the Galactic
Centre supermassive black hole (SMBH) candidate Sagittarius A* (Sgr A*), enabling us to probe gravity
in the strong-field regime. Besides studying the accretion process in extreme environments, the
obtained data and reconstructed images could be used to investigate the underlying spacetime structure.
In its current configuration, the EHT is able to distinguish between a rotating Kerr black hole and
a horizon-less object like a boson star. Future developments can increase the ability of the EHT
to tell different spacetimes apart. We investigate the capability of an advanced EHT concept, including
an orbiting space antenna, to image and distinguish different spacetimes around Sgr A*. We use GRMHD
simulations of accreting compact objects (Kerr and dilaton black holes, as well as boson stars)
and compute their radiative signatures via general relativistic radiative transfer calculations.
To facilitate comparison with upcoming and future EHT observations we produce realistic synthetic
data including the source variability, diffractive and refractive scattering while incorporating
the observing array, including a space antenna. From the generated synthetic observations we dynamically
reconstructed black hole shadow images using regularised Maximum Entropy methods. We employ a
genetic algorithm to optimise the orbit of the space antenna with respect to improved imaging capabilities
and u-v-plane coverage of the combined array (ground array and space antenna and developed a new
method to probe the source variability in Fourier space. The inclusion of an orbiting space antenna
improves the capability of the EHT to distinguish the spin of Kerr black holes and dilaton black holes
based on reconstructed radio images and complex visibilities.

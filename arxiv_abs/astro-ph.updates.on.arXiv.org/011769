We study the radial acceleration relation (RAR) between the total ($a_{\rm tot}$) and baryonic
($a_{\rm bary}$) centripetal acceleration profiles of central galaxies in the cold dark matter
(CDM) paradigm. We analytically show that the RAR is intimately connected with the physics of the
quasi-adiabatic relaxation of dark matter in the presence of baryons in deep potential wells. This
cleanly demonstrates how a near-universal mean RAR and its scatter emerges in the low-acceleration
regime ($10^{-12}\,{\rm m\,s}^{-2}\lesssim a_{\rm bary}\lesssim10^{-10}\,{\rm m\,s}^{-2}$)
from an interplay between baryonic feedback processes and the distribution of CDM in dark halos.
Our framework allows us to go further and study both higher and lower accelerations in detail, using
analytical approximations and a realistic mock catalog of $\sim342,000$ low-redshift central
galaxies with $M_r\leq-19$. We show that, while the RAR in the baryon-dominated, high-acceleration
regime ($a_{\rm bary}\gtrsim10^{-10}\,{\rm m\,s}^{-2}$) is very sensitive to details of the
relaxation physics, a simple `baryonification' prescription matching the relaxation results
of hydrodynamical CDM simulations is remarkably successful in reproducing the observed RAR without
any tuning. And in the (currently unobserved) ultra-low-acceleration regime ($a_{\rm bary}\lesssim
10^{-12}\,{\rm m\,s}^{-2}$), the RAR is sensitive to the abundance of diffuse gas in the halo outskirts,
with our default model predicting a distinctive break from a simple power-law-like relation for
HI-deficient, diffuse gas-rich centrals. Our mocks also show that the RAR provides more robust,
testable predictions of the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm at galactic scales, with implications for alternative
gravity theories, than the baryonic Tully-Fisher relation.

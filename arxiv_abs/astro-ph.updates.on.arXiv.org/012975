In recent years, integral-field spectroscopic surveys have revealed that the presence of kinematically-decoupled
stellar components is not a rare phenomenon in nearby galaxies. However, complete statistics are
still lacking because they depend on the detection limit of these objects. We aim at investigating
the kinematic signatures of two large-scale counter-rotating stellar disks in mock integral-field
spectroscopic data to address their detection limit as a function of the galaxy properties and instrumental
setup. We build a set of mock data of two large-scale counter-rotating stellar disks as if they were
observed with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE). We account for different photometric,
kinematic, and stellar population properties of the two counter-rotating components as a function
of galaxy inclination. We extract the stellar kinematics in the wavelength region of the Calcium
triplet absorption lines by adopting a Gauss-Hermite (GH) parametrization of the line-of-sight
velocity distribution (LOSVD). We confirm that the strongest signature of the presence of two counter-rotating
stellar disks is the symmetric double peak in the velocity dispersion map, already known as $2\sigma$
feature. The size, shape, and slope of the 2$\sigma$ peak strongly depend on the velocity separation
and relative light contribution of the two counter-rotating stellar disks. When the $2\sigma$
peak is difficult to detect due to the low signal-to-noise of the data, the large-scale structure
in the $h_3$ map can be used as a diagnostic for strong and weak counter-rotation. The counter-rotating
kinematic signatures become fainter at lower viewing angles as an effect of the smaller projected
velocity separation between the two counter-rotating components. We confirm that the observed
frequency of $2\sigma$ galaxies represents only a lower limit of the stellar counter-rotation
phenomenon.

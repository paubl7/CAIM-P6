Reionization-era galaxies tend to exhibit weak Ly$\alpha$ emission, likely reflecting attenuation
from an increasingly neutral IGM. Recent observations have begun to reveal exceptions to this picture,
with strong Ly$\alpha$ emission now known in four of the most massive z=7$-$9 galaxies in the CANDELS
fields, all of which also exhibit intense [OIII]$+$H$\beta$ emission (EW$>$800 $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$).
To better understand why Ly$\alpha$ is anonymously strong in a subset of massive z$\simeq$7$-$9
galaxies, we have initiated an MMT/Binospec survey targeting a larger sample (N=22) of similarly
luminous ($\simeq$1$-$6 L$^{\ast}_{\mathrm{UV}}$) z$\simeq$7 galaxies selected over very
wide-area fields ($\sim$3 deg$^2$). We confidently ($>$7$\sigma$) detect Ly$\alpha$ in 78% (7/9)
of galaxies with strong [OIII]$+$H$\beta$ emission (EW$>$800 $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$) as opposed
to only 8% (1/12) of galaxies with more moderate (EW=200$-$800 $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$) [OIII]$+$H$\beta$.
We argue that the higher Ly$\alpha$ EWs of the strong [OIII]$+$H$\beta$ population likely reflect
enhanced ionizing photon production efficiency owing to their large sSFRs ($\gtrsim$30 Gyr$^{-1}$).
We also find evidence that Ly$\alpha$ transmission from massive galaxies declines less rapidly
over $6<z<7$ than in low-mass lensed systems. In particular, our data suggest no strong evolution
in Ly$\alpha$ transmission, consistent with a picture wherein massive z$\simeq$7 galaxies often
reside in large ionized regions. We detect three closely-separated ($R$ = 1.7 physical Mpc) z$\simeq$7
Ly$\alpha$ emitters in our sample, conceivably tracing a large ionized structure that is consistent
with this picture. We detect tentative evidence for an overdensity in this region, implying a large
ionizing photon budget in the surrounding volume.

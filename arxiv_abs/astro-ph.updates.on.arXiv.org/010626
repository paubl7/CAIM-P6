In the context of large spectroscopic surveys of stars, data-driven methods are key in deducing
physical parameters for millions of spectra in a short time. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
enable us to connect observables (e.g. spectra, stellar magnitudes) to physical properties (atmospheric
parameters, chemical abundances, or labels in general). We trained a CNN, adopting stellar atmospheric
parameters and chemical abundances from APOGEE DR16 (resolution R=22500) data as training set
labels. As input, we used parts of the intermediate-resolution RAVE DR6 spectra (R~7500) overlapping
with the APOGEE DR16 data as well as broad-band ALL_WISE and 2MASS photometry, together with Gaia
DR2 photometry and parallaxes. We derived precise atmospheric parameters Teff, log(g), and [M/H]
along with the chemical abundances of [Fe/H], [alpha/M], [Mg/Fe], [Si/Fe], [Al/Fe], and [Ni/Fe]
for 420165 RAVE spectra. The precision typically amounts to 60K in Teff, 0.06 in log(g) and 0.02-0.04
dex for individual chemical abundances. Incorporating photometry and astrometry as additional
constraints substantially improves the results in terms of the accuracy and precision of the derived
labels. We provide a catalogue of CNN-trained atmospheric parameters and abundances along with
their uncertainties for 420165 stars in the RAVE survey. CNN-based methods provide a powerful way
to combine spectroscopic, photometric, and astrometric data without the need to apply any priors
in the form of stellar evolutionary models. The developed procedure can extend the scientific output
of RAVE spectra beyond DR6 to ongoing and planned surveys such as Gaia RVS, 4MOST, and WEAVE. We call
on the community to place a particular collective emphasis and on efforts to create unbiased training
samples for such future spectroscopic surveys.

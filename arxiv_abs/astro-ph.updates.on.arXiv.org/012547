We present a new insight into the propagation of ion magnetoacoustic and neutral acoustic waves
in a magnetic arcade in the lower solar atmosphere. By means of numerical simulations, we aim to:
(a) study two-fluid waves propagating in a magnetic arcade embedded in the partially-ionized,
lower solar atmosphere; and (b) investigate the impact of the background magnetic field configuration
on the observed wave-periods. We consider a 2D approximation of the gravitationally stratified
and partially-ionized lower solar atmosphere consisting of ion+electron and neutral fluids that
are coupled by ion-neutral collisions. In this model, the convection below the photosphere is responsible
for the excitation of ion magnetoacoustic-gravity and neutral acoustic-gravity waves. We find
that in the solar photosphere, where ions and neutrals are strongly coupled by collisions, ion magnetoacoustic-gravity
and neutral acoustic-gravity waves have periods ranging from 250 s to 350 s. In the chromosphere,
where the collisional coupling is weak, the wave characteristics strongly depend on the magnetic
field configuration. Above the foot-points of the considered arcade, the plasma is dominated by
a vertical magnetic field along which ion magnetoacoustic-gravity waves propagate. These waves
exhibit a broad range of periods with the most prominent periods of 180 s, 220 s, and 300 s. Above the
main loop of the solar arcade, where mostly horizontal magnetic field lines guide ion magnetoacoustic-gravity
waves, the main spectral power reduces to the period of about 180 s and longer wave-periods do not
exist. Our results are in agreement with the recent observational data reported by Wi\'sniewska
et al. (2016) and Kayshap et al. (2018).

The abundances of chemical elements and their depletion factors are essential parameters for understanding
the composition of the gas and dust that are ultimately incorporated into stars and planets. Sulfur
is an abundant but peculiar element in the sense that, despite being less volatile than other elements
(e.g., carbon), it is not a major constituent of dust grains in diffuse interstellar clouds. Here,
we determine the gas-phase carbon-to-sulfur abundance ratio, [C]/[S], and the sulfur abundance
[S] in a dense star-forming cloud from new radio recombination lines (RRLs) detected with the Yebes
40m telescope - at relatively high frequencies (~40 GHz ~7 mm) and angular resolutions (down to 36'')
- in the Orion Bar, a rim of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC). We detect nine Cn\alpha RRLs (with n=51
to 59) as well as nine narrow line features separated from the Cn\alpha lines by delta v=-8.4+/-0.3
km s^-1. Based on this velocity separation, we assign these features to sulfur RRLs, with little
contribution of RRLs from the more condensable elements Mg, Si, or Fe. Sulfur RRLs lines trace the
photodissociation region (PDR) of the OMC. In these predominantly neutral gas layers, up to A_V~4,
the ions C+ and S+ lock in most of the C and S gas-phase reservoir. We determine a relative abundance
of [C]_Ori/[S]_Ori=10.4+/-0.6 and, adopting the same [C]_Ori measured in the translucent gas
toward star theta^1 Ori B, an absolute abundance of [S]_Ori=(1.4+/-0.4)x10^-5. This value is consistent
with emission models of the observed sulfur RRLs if N(S+)~7x10^17 cm^-2 (beam-averaged). The [S]_Ori
is the ''initial'' sulfur abundance in the OMC, before an undetermined fraction of the [S]_Ori goes
into molecules and ice mantles in the cloud interior. The inferred abundance [S]_Ori matches the
solar abundance, thus implying that there is little depletion of sulfur onto rocky dust grains,
with D(S)=0.0+/-0.2 dex.

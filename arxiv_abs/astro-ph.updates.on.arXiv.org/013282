The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) Observatory, with dozens of telescopes located in both the
Northern and Southern Hemispheres, will be the largest ground-based gamma-ray observatory and
will provide broad energy coverage from 20 GeV to 300 TeV. The large effective area and field-of-view,
coupled with the fast slewing capability and unprecedented sensitivity, make CTA a crucial instrument
for the future of ground-based gamma-ray astronomy. To maximise the scientific return, the array
will send alerts on transients and variable phenomena (e.g. gamma-ray burst, active galactic nuclei,
gamma-ray binaries, serendipitous sources). Rapid and effective communication to the community
requires a reliable and automated system to detect and issue candidate science alerts. This automation
will be accomplished by the Science Alert Generation (SAG) pipeline, a key system of the CTA Observatory.
SAG is part of the Array Control and Data Acquisition (ACADA) working group. The SAG working group
develops the pipelines to perform data reconstruction, data quality monitoring, science monitoring
and real-time alert issuing during observations to the Transients Handler functionality of ACADA.
SAG is the system that performs the first real-time scientific analysis after the data acquisition.
The system performs analysis on multiple time scales (from seconds to hours). \abrb{SAG must issue
candidate science alerts within} 20 seconds from the data taking and with sensitivity at least half
of the CTA nominal sensitivity. These challenging requirements must be fulfilled by managing trigger
rates of tens of kHz from the arrays. Dedicated and highly optimised software and hardware architecture
must thus be designed and tested. In this work, we present the general architecture of the ACADA-SAG
system.

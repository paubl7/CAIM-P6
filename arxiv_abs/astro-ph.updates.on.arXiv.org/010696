(Abridged) Typically large telescope construction and operation costs scale up faster than their
collecting area. This slows scientific progress, making it expensive and complicated to increase
telescope size. A metric that represents the capability of an imaging survey telescopes, and that
captures a wide range of science objectives, is the telescope grasp -- the amount of volume of space
in which a standard candle is detectable per unit time. We provide an analytic expression for the
grasp, and also show that in the background-dominated noise limit, the optimal exposure time is
three times the dead time. We introduce a related metric we call the information-content grasp,
which summarizes the variance of all sources observed by the telescope per unit time. For seeing-dominated
sky surveys, in terms of grasp, etendue, or collecting-area optimization, recent technological
advancements make it more cost effective to construct multiple small telescopes rather than a single
large telescope with a similar grasp or etendue. Among these key advancements are the availability
of large-format back-side illuminated CMOS detectors with <4 micron pixels, well suited to sample
standard seeing conditions given typical focal lengths of small fast telescopes. We also discuss
the possible use of multiple small telescopes for spectroscopy. We argue that if all the obstacles
to implementing cost-effective wide-field imaging and multi-object spectrographs using multiple
small telescopes are removed, then the motivation to build new single large-aperture (>1m) visible-light
telescopes which are seeing-dominated, will be weakened. These ideas have led to the concept of
the, currently under construction, Large-Array Survey Telescope (LAST).

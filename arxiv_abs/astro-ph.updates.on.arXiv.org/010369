Pair-instability (PI) is expected to open a gap in the mass spectrum of black holes between $\approx{}40-65$
M$_\odot$ and $\sim{}120$ M$_\odot$. The existence of the mass gap is currently being challenged
by the detection of GW190521, with a primary component mass of $85^{+21}_{-14}$ M$_{\odot}$. Here,
we investigate the main uncertainties on the PI mass gap: the $^{12}$C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)$^{16}$O
reaction rate and the collapse of the H envelope. Even with the standard $^{12}$C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)$^{16}$O
rate, the lower edge of the mass gap can be as high as 70 M$_\odot$ if we allow for the collapse of the
residual H envelope at metallicity $Z\leq{}0.0003$. For models computed with the standard $^{12}$C($\alpha$,
$\gamma$)$^{16}$O rate $-1\,{}\sigma{}$, the PI mass gap ranges between $\sim{}80$ M$_\odot$
and $\sim{}150$ M$_\odot$. In fact, stars with $M_{\rm ZAMS}>110$ M$_\odot$ may experience a deep
dredge-up episode during the core helium-burning phase, that extracts matter from the core enriching
the envelope. As a consequence, the reduction of the He-core mass due to convective dredge-up may
lead a star with an initial mass of 160 M$_{\odot}$ to avoid the PI supernova and produce a BH with a
mass of 150 M$_\odot$. The effect of dredge-up becomes stronger if we consider lower rates for the
$^{12}$C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)$^{16}$O reaction. In the $-2\,{}\sigma{}$ case, the PI mass gap
ranges from 92 M$_\odot$ to 110 M$_\odot$. Finally, in models computed with $^{12}$C($\alpha$,
$\gamma$)$^{16}$O $-3\,{}\sigma{}$, the mass gap is completely removed by the effect of dredge-up.
The onset of this dredge up is particularly sensitive to the assumed model for convection and mixing.
The combined effect of H envelope collapse and low $^{12}$C($\alpha$, $\gamma$)$^{16}$O rate
can lead to the formation of BHs with masses consistent with the primary component of GW190521.

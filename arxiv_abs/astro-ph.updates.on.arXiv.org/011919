We check the dynamical and observational features of four typologies of logotropic dark energy
models, leading to a \emph{thermodynamic cosmic speed up} fueled by a single fluid that unifies
dark energy and dark matter. We first present two principal Anton-Schmidt fluids where the Gr\"uneisen
parameter $\gamma_{\rm G}$ is free to vary and then fixed to the special value $\gamma_{\rm G}=\tfrac{5}{6}$.
We also investigate the pure logotropic model, corresponding to $\gamma_{\rm G}=-\frac{1}{6}$.
Finally, we propose a new logotropic paradigm that works as a generalized logotropic fluid, in which
we split the role of dark matter and baryons. We demonstrate that the logotropic paradigms may present
drawbacks in perturbations, showing a negative adiabatic sound speed which make perturbations
unstable. The Anton-Schmidt model with $\gamma_{\rm G}=\frac{5}{6}$ is ruled out while the generalized
logotropic fluid seems to be the most suitable one, albeit weakly disfavored than the $\Lambda$CDM
model. We combine low- and higher-redshift domains through experimental fits based on Monte Carlo
Markov Chain procedures, taking into account supernovae Ia catalogue, Hubble measurements and
$\sigma_8$ data points. We consider two model selection criteria to infer the statistical significance
of the four models. We conclude there is statistical advantage to handle the Anton-Schmidt fluid
with the Gr\"uneisen parameter free to vary and/or fixed to $\gamma_{\rm G}=-\frac{1}{6}$. The
generalized logotropic fluid indicates suitable results, statistically favored than the other
models, until the sound speed is positive, becoming unstable in perturbations elsewhere. We emphasize
that the $\Lambda$CDM paradigm works statistically better than any kinds of logotropic and generalized
logotropic models, while the Chevallier-Polarski-Linder parametrization is statistically
comparable with logotropic scenarios.

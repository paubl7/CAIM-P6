Vigorous mass loss in the classical Wolf-Rayet (WR) phase is important for the late evolution and
final fate of massive stars. We develop spherically symmetric time-dependent and steady-state
hydrodynamical models of the radiation-driven wind outflows and associated mass loss from classical
WR stars. The simulations are based on combining the opacities typically used in static stellar
structure and evolution models with a simple parametrised form for the enhanced line-opacity expected
within a supersonic outflow. Our simulations reveal high mass-loss rates initiated in deep and
hot optically thick layers around T\approx 200kK. The resulting velocity structure is non-monotonic
and can be separated into three phases: i) an initial acceleration to supersonic speeds ii) stagnation
and even deceleration, and iii) an outer region of rapid re-acceleration. The characteristic structures
seen in converged steady-state simulations agree well with the outflow properties of our time-dependent
models. By directly comparing our dynamic simulations to corresponding hydrostatic models, we
demonstrate explicitly that the need to invoke extra energy transport in convectively inefficient
regions of stellar structure and evolution models is merely an artefact of enforcing a hydrostatic
outer boundary. Moreover, the "dynamically inflated" inner regions of our simulations provide
a natural explanation for the often-found mismatch between predicted hydrostatic WR radii and
those inferred from spectroscopy. Finally, we contrast our simulations with alternative recent
WR wind models based on co-moving frame radiative transfer for computing the radiation force. Since
CMF transfer currently cannot handle non-monotonic velocity fields, the characteristic deceleration
regions found here are avoided in such simulations by invoking an ad-hoc very high degree of clumping.

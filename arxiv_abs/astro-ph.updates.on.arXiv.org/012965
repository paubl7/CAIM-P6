With the advent of next generation high resolution telescopes, our understanding of how the magnetic
field is organized in the internetwork photosphere is likely to advance.We aim to evaluate the extent
to which we can retrieve information about the magnetic vector in the internetwork (IN) photosphere
using inversions. We use snapshots produced from high resolution 3D magnetohydrodynamic (MHD)
simulations and employ the Stokes Inversions based on Response functions (SIR) code to produce
synthetic observables in the near infrared spectral window observed by the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph
(GRIS), which contains the highly magnetically sensitive photospheric Fe I line pair at 15648.52
A and 15652.87 A. We perform nearly 14 million inversions to test how well the true MHD atmospheric
parameters can be constrained. Finally, we degrade the synthetic Stokes vectors spectrally and
spatially to GREGOR resolutions and examine how this influences observations, considering the
impact of stray light, spatial resolution and signal-to-noise (S-to-N). We find the depth-averaged
parameters can be recovered by the inversions of the undegraded profiles, and by adding gradients
to magnetic field strength, inclination and line of sight velocity we show an improvement in the
chi squared value is achieved. We evaluate the extent to which we can constrain these parameters
at various optical depths, with the kinematic and thermodynamic parameters sensitive deeper in
the atmosphere than the magnetic parameters. We find the S-to-N and spatial resolution play a significant
role in determining how the atmosphere appears and the magnetic and kinematic parameters are invariant
upon inclusion of unpolarized stray light. We studied a linear polarization feature which resembles
those recently observed by GRIS, appearing as loop-like structures with similar magnetic flux
density.

Rossby modes (r-modes) of rotating neutron stars can be excited by the gravitomagnetic forces in
coalescing binary systems. The previous study by Flanagan and Racine [Phys. Rev. D 75, 044001 (2007)]
showed that this kind of dynamical tide (DT) can induce phase shifts of 0.1 rad on gravitational waveforms,
which is detectable by third-generation (3G) detectors. In this paper, we study the impact of this
DT on measuring neutron-star parameters in the era of 3G detectors. We incorporate two universal
relations among neutron star properties predicted by different equations of state: (i) the well-known
I-Love relation between momentum of inertia and (f-mode) tidal Love number, and (ii) a relation
between the r-mode overlap and tidal Love number, which is newly explored in this paper. We find that
r-mode DT will provide rich information about slowly rotating neutron stars with frequency ranging
from 10 to 100 Hz. For a binary neutron star system (with a signal-to-noise ratio around 1500 in the
Cosmic Explorer), the spin frequency of each individual neutron star can be constrained to 6% (fractional
error) in the best-case scenario. The degeneracy between the Love numbers of individual neutron
stars is dramatically reduced: each individual Love number can be constrained to around 20% in the
best case, while the fractional error for both symmetric and anti-symmetric Love numbers are reduced
by factors of around 300. Furthermore, DT also allows us to measure the spin inclination angles of
the neutron stars, to 0.09 rad in the best case, and thus place constraints on NS natal kicks and supernova
explosion models. Besides parameter estimation, we have also developed a semi-analytic method
that accurately describes detailed features of the binary evolution that arise due to the DT.

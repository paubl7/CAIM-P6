Recent multi-messenger detection of the binary neutron star merger (GW170817) energized the astrophysical
community and encouraged further research for determination of nuclear physics observables.
Comprehensive studies of atomic nuclei in the cosmos provide an opportunity for investigating
these astrophysical phenomena and acquiring complementary information on stellar nucleosynthesis
processes that can be verified using the latest nuclear data. Evaluated Nuclear Data File (ENDF)
libraries contain complete collections of reaction cross sections over the energy range relevant
to astrophysics, fission yields and decay data. These data collections have been used worldwide
in nuclear science, industry and national security applications. There is great interest in exploring
the ENDF/B-VIII.0 and TALYS Evaluated Nuclear Data Library (TENDL-2015) for nuclear astrophysics
purposes and comparing findings with the Karlsruhe Astrophysical Database of Nucleosynthesis
in Stars (KADoNiS). The Maxwellian-averaged cross sections (MACS) and astrophysical reaction
rates have been calculated using the ENDF/B-VIII.0 and TENDL-2015 evaluated data sets. The calculated
cross sections were combined with the solar system abundances and fitted using the classical model
of stellar nucleosynthesis. Astrophysical rapid- and slow-neutron capture, $r$- and $s$-process,
respectively, abundances were obtained from present data and compared with available values.
Further analysis of MACS reveals potential evaluated libraries data deficiencies and a strong
need for new measurements. The current results demonstrate a large nuclear astrophysics potential
of evaluated libraries and mutually beneficial relations between nuclear industry and research
efforts.

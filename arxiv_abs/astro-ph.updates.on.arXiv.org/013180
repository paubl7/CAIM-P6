The linear polarization images of the jet in the giant elliptical galaxy M87 have previously been
observed with Very Long Baseline Array at 7 mm. They exhibit a complex polarization structure surrounding
the optically thick and compact core. However, given the low level of linear polarization in the
core, it is required to verify that this complex structure does not originate from residual instrumental
polarization signals in the data. We have performed a new analysis using the same data set in four
epochs by applying the Generalized Polarization CALibration pipeline (GPCAL). This novel instrumental
polarization calibration pipeline overcomes the limitations of LPCAL, a conventional calibration
tool used in the previous studies. The resulting images show a compact polarization structure with
its peak nearly coincident with the total intensity peak, which is significantly different from
the results of previous studies. The core polarization is characterized as fractional polarizations
of $\sim0.2-0.6\%$ and polarization angles of $\sim66-92^\circ$, showing moderate variability.
We demonstrate that, using synthetic data, LPCAL cannot achieve sufficient calibration accuracy
to reveal the true polarization structure of M87 due to a breakdown of the similarity approximation.
We show that our new polarization images better account for observed closure traces that are insensitive
to both station gain and polarization leakage than those obtained from LPCAL. We discuss the observed
polarizations by comparing them with the measurements at other frequencies. This study suggests
that robust polarization imaging of very weak polarization sources has become possible with the
advanced instrumental polarization calibration technique.

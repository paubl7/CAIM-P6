Galactic cosmic-ray (GCR) flux short-term variations ($<$1 month) in the inner heliosphere are
mainly associated with the passage of high-speed solar wind streams (HSS) and interplanetary (IP)
counterparts of coronal mass ejections (ICMEs). Data gathered with a particle detector flown on
board the ESA LISA Pathfinder (LPF) spacecraft, during the declining part of the solar cycle 24 (February
2016 - July 2017) around the Lagrange point L1, have allowed to study the characteristics of recurrent
cosmic-ray flux modulations above 70 MeV n$^{-1}$. %These modulations are observed when the solar
wind speed is $>$ 400 km s$^{-1}$ and/or the IP magnetic field intensity $>$ 10 nT. It is shown that
the amplitude and evolution of individual modulations depend in a unique way on both IP plasma parameters
and particle flux intensity before HSS and ICMEs transit. By comparing the LPF data with those gathered
contemporaneously with the magnetic spectrometer experiment AMS-02 on board the International
Space Station and with those of Earth polar neutron monitors, the GCR flux modulation was studied
at different energies during recurrent short-term variations. It is also aimed to set the near real-time
particle observation requirements to disentangle the role of long and short-term variations of
the GCR flux to evaluate the performance of high-sensitivity instruments in space such as the future
interferometers for gravitational wave detection. Finally, the association between recurrent
GCR flux variation observations in L1 and weak to moderate geomagnetic activity in 2016-2017 is
discussed. Short-term recurrent GCR flux variations are good proxies of recurrent geomagnetic
activity when the B$_z$ component of the IP magnetic field is directed northern.

Observations of protoplanetary disks (PPDs) at sub-mm wavelengths suggest that polarisation
is caused by scattering of thermal radiation. Most of the dust models that are used to explain these
observations have major drawbacks: They either use much smaller grains than expected from dust
evolution models, or result in lower polarisations than observed. We investigate the effect of
dust grain porosity on the polarisation due to scattering at sub-mm wavelengths arising from grains
of up to mm sizes, as they are expected to be present in the midplane of PPDs. Using the effective medium
theory, we calculated the optical properties of porous dust and used them to predict the behaviour
of the scattering polarisation. Subsequently, radiative transfer simulations for PPDs with porous
dust were performed to analyse the additional effect of the optical depth structure, and thus the
effect of multiple scattering events and inhomogeneous temperature distributions on the polarisation.
We find that porous dust with moderate filling factors of about 10\% increase the polarisation compared
to compact grains. For higher grain porosities, that is, grains with a filling factor of 1\% or lower,
the extinction opacity decreases, as does the optical depth of a disk with constant mass. Consequently,
the unpolarised direct radiation dominates the scattered flux, and the polarisation drops rapidly.
Even though the simulated polarisation is higher than in the case of compact grains, it is still below
the typical observed values for face-on disks. However, the polarisation can be increased when
crucial model assumptions derived from disk and dust evolution theories, for instance, dust settling
and mm-sized dust grains, are dropped. In the case of inclined disks, however, our reference model
is able to achieve polarisation degrees of about 1\%, and using higher disk masses, even higher than
this.

We constrain the redshift dependence of gas pressure bias $\left\langle b_{y} P_{\mathrm{e}}\right\rangle$
(bias-weighted average electron pressure), which characterises the thermodynamics of intergalactic
gas, through a combination of cross-correlations between galaxy positions and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich
(tSZ) effect, as well as galaxy positions and the gravitational lensing of the cosmic microwave
background (CMB). The galaxy sample is from the 4th data release of the Kilo-Degree Survey (KiDS).
The tSZ $y$ map and the CMB lensing map are from the Planck 2015 and 2018 data releases, respectively.
The measurements are performed in five redshift bins with $z\lesssim1$. With these measurements,
combining galaxy-tSZ and galaxy-CMB lensing cross-correlations allows us to break the degeneracy
between galaxy bias and gas pressure bias, and hence constrain them simultaneously. In all redshift
bins, the best-fit values of $\left\langle b_{y} P_{\mathrm{e}}\right\rangle$ are at a level
of $\sim 0.3\, \mathrm{meV/cm^3}$ and increase slightly with redshift. The galaxy bias is consistent
with unity in all the redshift bins. Our results are not sensitive to the non-linear details of the
cross-correlation, which are smoothed out by the Planck beam. Our measurements are in agreement
with previous measurements as well as with theoretical predictions. We also show that our conclusions
are not changed when CMB lensing is replaced by galaxy lensing, which shows consistency of the two
lensing signals despite their radically different redshift range. This study demonstrates the
feasibility of using CMB lensing to calibrate the galaxy distribution such that the galaxy distribution
can be used as a mass proxy without relying on the precise knowledge of the matter distribution.

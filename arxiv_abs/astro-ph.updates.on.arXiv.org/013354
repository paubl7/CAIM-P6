Recently, an increasing number of wide binaries has been discovered. Their chemical and dynamical
properties are studied through extensive surveys and pointed observations. However, the formation
of these wide binaries is far from clear, although several scenarios have been suggested. In order
to investigate the chemical compositions of these systems, we analysed high-resolution spectroscopy
of three wide binary pairs belonging to the Galactic halo. In total, another three candidates from
our original sample of 11 candidates observed at various resolutions with various instruments
were refuted as co-moving pairs because their radial velocities are significantly different.
Within our sample of wide binaries, we found homogeneity amongst the pair components in dynamical
properties (proper motion and line-of-sight velocities) and also in chemical composition. Their
metallicities are -1.16, -1.42, and -0.79 dex in [Fe/H] for each wide binary pair, which places these
stars on the metal-poor side of wide binaries reported in the literature. In particular, the most
metal-poor pair in our sample (WB2 = HD134439/HD134440) shows a lower [$\alpha$/Fe] abundance
ratio than Milky Way field stars, which is a clear signature of an accreted object. We also confirmed
that this wide binary shares remarkably similar orbital properties with stars and globular clusters
associated with the Sequoia event. Thus, it appears that the WB2 pair was formed in a dwarf galaxy
environment and subsequently dissolved into the Milky Way halo. Although the other two wide binaries
appear to arise from a different formation mechanism, our results provide a novel opportunity for
understanding the formation of wide binaries and the assembly process of the Milky Way.

We characterise the thermal state of the intergalactic medium (IGM) in ten redshift bins in the redshift
range $2 \leq z \leq 4$ with a sample of 103 high resolution, high S/N Ly$\alpha$ forest spectra using
four different flux distribution statistics. Our measurements are calibrated with mock spectra
from a large suite of hydrodynamical simulations post-processed with our thermal IGM evolution
code CITE, finely sampling amplitude and slope of the expected temperature-density relation.
The thermal parameters inferred from our measurements of the flux power spectrum, Doppler parameter
distribution, as well as wavelet and curvature statistics agree well within their respective errors
and all clearly show the peak in temperature and minimum in slope of the temperature density relation
expected from HeII reionization. Combining our measurements from the different flux statistics
gives $T_0=(14750 \pm 1322)$K for the peak temperature at mean density and a corresponding minimum
slope $\gamma = 1.225 \pm 0.120$. The peak in the temperature evolution occurs at $z \approx 3$, in
agreement with previous measurements that had suggested the presence of such a peak, albeit with
a large scatter. Using CITE, we also calculate the thermal state of the IGM predicted by five widely
used (spatially homogeneous) UV-background models. The rather rapid thermal evolution inferred
by our measurements is well reproduced by two of the models, if we assume (physically well motivated)
non-equilibrium evolution with photo-heating rates that are reduced by a moderate factor of $\sim
0.7-0.8$. The other three models predict HeII reionization to be more extended with a somewhat earlier
as well as higher temperature peak than our measurements suggest.

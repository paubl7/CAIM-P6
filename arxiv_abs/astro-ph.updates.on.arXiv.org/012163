What is habitability? Can we quantify it? What do we mean under the term habitable or potentially
habitable planet? With estimates of the number of planets in our Galaxy alone running into billions,
possibly a number greater than the number of stars, it is high time to start characterizing them,
sorting them into classes/types just like stars, to better understand their formation paths, their
properties and, ultimately, their ability to beget or sustain life. After all, we do have life thriving
on one of these billions of planets, why not on others? Which planets are better suited for life and
which ones are definitely not worth spending expensive telescope time on? We need to find sort of
quick assessment score, a metric, using which we can make a list of promising planets and dedicate
our efforts to them. Exoplanetary habitability is a transdisciplinary subject integrating astrophysics,
astrobiology, planetary science, even terrestrial environmental sciences. We review the existing
metrics of habitability and the new classification schemes of extrasolar planets and provide an
exposition of the use of computational intelligence techniques to evaluate habitability scores
and to automate the process of classification of exoplanets. We examine how solving convex optimization
techniques, as in computing new metrics such as CDHS and CEESA, cross-validates ML-based classification
of exoplanets. Despite the recent criticism of exoplanetary habitability ranking, this field
has to continue and evolve to use all available machinery of astroinformatics, artificial intelligence
and machine learning. It might actually develop into a sort of same scale as stellar types in astronomy,
to be used as a quick tool of screening exoplanets in important characteristics in search for potentially
habitable planets for detailed follow-up targets.

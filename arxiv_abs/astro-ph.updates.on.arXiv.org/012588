In the context of forthcoming galaxy surveys, to ensure unbiased constraints on cosmology and gravity
when using non-linear structure information, percent-level accuracy is required when modelling
the power spectrum. This calls for frameworks that can accurately capture the relevant physical
effects, while allowing for deviations from $\Lambda$CDM. Massive neutrino and baryonic physics
are two of the most relevant such effects. We present an integration of the halo model reaction frameworks
for massive neutrinos and beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies. The integrated halo model reaction,
combined with a pseudo power spectrum modelled by HMCode2020 is then compared against $N$-body
simulations that include both massive neutrinos and an $f(R)$ modification to gravity. We find
that the framework is 5% accurate down to at least $k\approx 3 \, h/{\rm Mpc}$ for a modification to
gravity of $|f_{\rm R0}|\leq 10^{-5}$ and for the total neutrino mass $M_\nu \equiv \sum m_\nu \leq
0.15$ eV. We also find that the framework is 4(1)% consistent with the Bacco (EuclidEmulator2) emulator
for $\nu w$CDM cosmologies down to at least $k \approx 3 \, h$/Mpc. Finally, we compare against hydrodynamical
simulations employing HMCode2020's baryonic feedback modelling on top of the halo model reaction.
For $\nu \Lambda$CDM cosmologies we find 2% accuracy for $M_\nu \leq 0.48$eV down to at least $k\approx
5h$/Mpc. Similar accuracy is found when comparing to $\nu w$CDM hydrodynamical simulations with
$M_\nu = 0.06$eV. This offers the first non-linear and theoretically general means of accurately
including massive neutrinos for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM cosmologies, and further suggests that
baryonic effects can be reliably modelled independently of massive neutrino and dark energy physics.
These extensions have been integrated into the publicly available ReACT code.

We study the significance of non-Gaussianity in the likelihood of weak lensing shear two-point
correlation functions, detecting significantly non-zero skewness and kurtosis in one-dimensional
marginal distributions of shear two-point correlation functions in simulated weak lensing data.
We examine the implications in the context of future surveys, in particular LSST, with derivations
of how the non-Gaussianity scales with survey area. We show that there is no significant bias in one-dimensional
posteriors of $\Omega_{\rm m}$ and $\sigma_{\rm 8}$ due to the non-Gaussian likelihood distributions
of shear correlations functions using the mock data ($100$ deg$^{2}$). We also present a systematic
approach to constructing approximate multivariate likelihoods with one-dimensional parametric
functions by assuming independence or more flexible non-parametric multivariate methods after
decorrelating the data points using principal component analysis (PCA). While the use of PCA does
not modify the non-Gaussianity of the multivariate likelihood, we find empirically that the one-dimensional
marginal sampling distributions of the PCA components exhibit less skewness and kurtosis than
the original shear correlation functions.Modeling the likelihood with marginal parametric functions
based on the assumption of independence between PCA components thus gives a lower limit for the biases.
We further demonstrate that the difference in cosmological parameter constraints between the
multivariate Gaussian likelihood model and more complex non-Gaussian likelihood models would
be even smaller for an LSST-like survey. In addition, the PCA approach automatically serves as a
data compression method, enabling the retention of the majority of the cosmological information
while reducing the dimensionality of the data vector by a factor of $\sim$5.

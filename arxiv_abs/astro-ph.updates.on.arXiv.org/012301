Context. Hot subdwarfs experienced strong mass loss on the Red Giant Branch (RGB) and are now hot
and small He-burning objects. Aims. In this project we aim to perform a transit survey in all available
light curves of hot subdwarfs from space-based telescopes (Kepler, K2, TESS, and CHEOPS), with
our custom-made pipeline SHERLOCK, in order to determine the occurrence rate of planets around
these stars, as a function of orbital period and planetary radius. Methods. In this first paper,
we perform injection-and-recovery tests of synthetic transits for a selection of representative
Kepler, K2 and TESS light curves, to determine which transiting bodies, in terms of object radius
and orbital period, we will be able to detect with our tools. We also provide such estimates for CHEOPS
data, which we analyze with the pycheops package. Results. Transiting objects with a radius $\lesssim$
1.0 $R_{\Earth}$ can be detected in most of Kepler, K2 and CHEOPS targets for the shortest orbital
periods (1 d and below), reaching values as small as $\sim$0.3 $R_{\Earth}$ in the best cases. Reaching
sub-Earth-sized bodies is achieved only for the brightest TESS targets, and the ones observed during
a significant number of sectors. We also give a series of representative results for farther and
bigger planets, for which the performances strongly depend on the target magnitude, the length
and the quality of the data. Conclusions. The TESS sample will provide the most important statistics
for the global aim of measuring the planet occurrence rate around hot subdwarfs. The Kepler, K2 and
CHEOPS data will allow us to search for planetary remnants, i.e. very close and small (possibly disintegrating)
objects, which would have partly survived the engulfment in their red giant host.

Transition disks form a special class of protoplanetary disks that are characterized by a deficiency
of disk material close to the star. In a subgroup, inner holes in these disks can stretch out to a few
tens of au while there is still mass accretion onto the central star observed. We analyse the proposition
that this type of wide transition disks is generated by the interaction of the disk with a system of
embedded planets. We performed 2D hydrodynamics simulations of a flat disk using either a locally
isothermal equation of state or considering also radiative effects. Two 3 to 9 Jupiter mass planets
were embedded in the disk and their dynamical evolution due to disk-planet interaction was followed
for over 100 000 years. The simulations account for mass accretion onto the star and planets. We included
models with parameters geared to the system PDS 70. To assess the observability of features in our
models we performed synthetic ALMA observations. For systems with a more massive inner planet there
are phases where both planets migrate outward engaged in a 2:1 mean motion resonance via the Masset-Snellgrove
mechanism. In sufficiently massive disks the formation of a vortex in the outer disk can trigger
rapid outward migration of the outer planet where its distance increases by tens of au within a few
thousand years. Later, the outer planet migrates back inwards settling again into resonance with
the inner planet. We call this emerging composite phenomenon a 'migration jump'. Outward migration
and the migration jumps are accompanied by a high mass accretion rate onto the star. The synthetic
images reveal numerous substructures depending on the type of dynamical behaviour. Our results
suggest that the outward migration of two embedded planets is a prime candidate for the explanation
of the observed high stellar mass accretion rate in wide transition disks.

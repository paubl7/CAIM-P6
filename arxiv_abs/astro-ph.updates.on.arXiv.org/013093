Context: Th 28 is a Classical T Tauri star in the Lupus 3 cloud which drives an extended bipolar jet.
Previous studies of the inner jet identified signatures of rotation around the outflow axis, a key
result for theories of jet launching. Thus this is an important source in which to investigate the
poorly understood jet launching mechanism. We investigate the morphology and kinematics of the
Th 28 micro-jets with the aim of characterizing their structure and outflow activity, using optical
integral-field spectroscopy observations obtained with VLT/MUSE. We use spectro-imaging and
position-velocity maps to investigate the kinematic and morphological features of the jet, and
obtain a catalogue of emission lines in which the jet is visible. A Lucy-Richardson deconvolution
procedure is used to differentiate the structure of the inner micro-jet region. Spatial profiles
extracted perpendicular to the jet axis are fitted to investigate the jet width, opening angle and
the evolution of the jet axis. We confirm the previously identified knot HHW$_{2}$ within the red-shifted
jet and identify three additional knots in each lobe for the first time. We also find [O III]$\lambda$5007
emission from the blue-shifted micro-jet including the knot closest to the star. Proper motions
for the innermost knots on each side are estimated and we show that new knots are ejected on an approximate
timescale of 10-15 years. The jet axis centroids show a point-symmetric wiggle within the inner
portion of both micro-jets indicating precession. We use the jet shape to measure a precession period
of 8 years, with a half-opening angle < 0.6$^{\circ}$. This may provide an alternative explanation
for the rotation signatures previously reported. We find the jet shape to be compatible with precession
due to a brown dwarf companion orbiting at a separation $\leq$ 0.3 au.

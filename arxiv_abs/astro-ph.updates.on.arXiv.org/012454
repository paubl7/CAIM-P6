We use idealized N-body simulations of equilibrium stellar disks embedded within course-grained
dark matter haloes to study the effects of spurious collisional heating on disk structure and kinematics.
Collisional heating drives a systematic increase in both the vertical and radial velocity dispersions
of disk stars, and leads to an artificial increase in the thickness and size of disks; the effects
are felt at all galacto-centric radii, and are not limited to the central regions of galaxies. We
demonstrate that relaxation is driven primarily by the coarse-grained nature of simulated dark
matter haloes, with bulges, stellar haloes and disk stars contributing little to disk heating.
The integrated effects of collisional heating are determined primarily by the mass of dark matter
particles (or equivalently by the number of particles at fixed halo mass), their local density and
characteristic velocity, but are largely insensitive to the masses of stellar particles. This
suggests that the effects of numerical relaxation on simulated galaxies can be reduced by increasing
the mass resolution of the dark matter in cosmological simulations, with limited benefits from
increasing the baryonic (or stellar) mass resolution. We provide a simple empirical model that
accurately captures the effects of collisional heating on the vertical and radial velocity dispersions
of disk stars, as well as on their scale heights. We use the model to assess the extent to which spurious
collisional relaxation may have affected the structure of simulated galaxy disks. For example,
we find that dark matter haloes resolved with fewer than $\approx 10^6$ particles will collisionally
heat stars near the stellar half-mass radius such that their vertical velocity dispersion increases
by more than 10 per cent of the halo's virial velocity in approximately one Hubble time.

We present analyses of host galaxy properties of type 1 and type 2 X-ray selected AGNs in the XMM-XXL
field, which have available optical spectroscopic classification. We model their optical to far-infrared
spectral energy distributions (SEDs) using the X-CIGALE code. X-CIGALE allows the fitting of X-ray
flux and accounts for the viewing angle of dusty torus and the attenuation from polar dust. By selecting
matched type 1 and 2 subsamples in the X-ray luminosity and redshift parameter space, we find that
both types live in galaxies with similar star formation. However, type 2 AGN tend to reside in more
massive systems ($10.87^{+0.06}_{-0.12}\,\rm M_\odot$) compared to their type 1 counterparts
($10.57^{+0.20}_{-0.12}\,\rm M_\odot$). In the second part of our analysis, we compare the spectroscopic
classification with that from the SED fitting. X-CIGALE successfully identifies all spectroscopic
type 2 sources either by estimating an inclination angle that corresponds to edge on viewing of the
source or by measuring increased polar dust in these systems. $\sim 85\%$ of spectroscopic type
1 AGN are also identified as such, based on the SED fitting analysis. There is a small number of sources
($\sim 15\%$ of the sample), that present broad lines in their spectra, but show strong indications
of obscuration, based on SED analysis. These, could be systems that are viewed face on and have an
extended dust component along the polar direction. The performance of X-CIGALE in classifying
AGN is similar at low and high redshifts, under the condition that there is sufficient photometric
coverage. Finally, usage of optical/mid-IR colour criteria to identify optical red AGN (${\it{u}}-\rm
W3$), suggests that these criteria are better suited for IR selected AGN and their efficiency drops
for the low to moderate luminosity sources included in X-ray samples.

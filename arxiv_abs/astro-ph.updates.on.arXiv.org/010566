Efforts to detect a primordial $B$-mode of CMB polarization generated by inflationary gravitational
waves ought to mitigate the large variance associated with the $B$-modes produced by gravitational
lensing, a process known as delensing. A popular approach to delensing entails building a lensing
$B$-mode template by mimicking the lensing operation, either at gradient order or non-perturbatively,
using high-resolution $E$-mode observations and some proxy of the lensing potential. By explicitly
calculating all contributions to two-loop order in lensing to the power spectrum of $B$-modes delensed
with such a template in the noise-free limit, we are able to show that: (i) corrections to the leading-order
calculation of the lensing $B$-mode power spectrum only enter at the $O(1)\,\%$ level because of
extensive cancellations between large terms at next-to-leading order; (ii) these cancellations
would disappear if a gradient-order template were to be built from unlensed or delensed $E$-modes,
giving rise to a residual delensing floor of $O(10)\,\%$ of the original power; (iii) new cancellations
arise when the lensed $E$-modes are used in the gradient-order template, allowing for the delensing
floor to be as low as $O(1)\,\%$ of the original power in practical applications of this method; and
(iv) these new cancellations would disappear for a non-perturbative template constructed from
the lensed $E$-modes, reintroducing a residual delensing floor of $O(10)\,\%$. We further show
that the gradient-order template outperforms the non-perturbative one in realistic scenarios
with noisy estimates of the $E$-mode polarization and lensing potential. We therefore recommend
that in practical applications of $B$-mode template delensing, where the template is constructed
directly from the (filtered) observed $E$-modes, the gradient-order approach should be used rather
than a non-perturbative remapping.

Understanding the source of sub-stellar polarimetric observations in the optical and near-infrared
is key to characterizing sub-stellar objects and developing potential diagnostics for determining
properties of their atmospheres. Differential scattering from a population of aligned, non-spherical
dust grains is a potential source of polarization that could be used to determine geometric properties
of the dust clouds. This paper addresses the problem of the spheroidal growth of dust grains in electrically
activated sub-stellar atmospheres. It presents the novel application of a mechanism whereby non-spherical,
elongated dust grains can be grown via plasma deposition as a consequence of the surface electric
field effects of charged dust grains. We numerically solve the differential equations governing
the spheroidal growth of charged dust grains via plasma deposition as a result of surface electric
field effects in order to determine how the dust eccentricity and the dust particle eccentricity
distribution function evolve with time. From these results, we determine the effect of spheroidal
dust on the observed linear polarization. Numerical solutions show that $e\approx 0.94$ defines
a watershed eccentricity, where the eccentricity of grains with an initial eccentricity less than
(greater than) this value decreases (increases) and spherical (spheroidal) growth occurs. This
produces a characteristic bimodal eccentricity distribution function yielding a fractional
change in the observed linear polarization of up to $\approx0.1$ corresponding to dust grains of
maximal eccentricity at wavelengths of $\approx1 \mu$m, consistent with the near infrared observational
window. The results presented here are relevant to the growth of non-spherical, irregularly shaped
dust grains of general geometry where non-uniform surface electric field effects of charged dust
grains are significant.

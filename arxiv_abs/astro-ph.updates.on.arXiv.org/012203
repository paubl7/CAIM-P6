Using photometric galaxies from the HSC survey, we measure the stellar mass density profiles for
satellite galaxies as a function of the projected distance, $r_p$, to isolated central galaxies
(ICGs) selected from SDSS/DR7 spectroscopic galaxies at $z\sim0.1$. By stacking images and recovering
the stellar mass from the PSF-deconvolved color profiles, we also measure the projected stellar
mass density profiles for ICGs and their stellar halos. The total mass distributions are further
measured from HSC weak lensing signals. ICGs dominate within $\sim$0.15 times the halo virial radius
($0.15R_{200}$). The stellar mass versus total mass fractions drop with the increase in $r_p$ up
to $\sim0.15R_{200}$, beyond which they are less than 1\% while stay almost constant, indicating
the radial distribution of satellites trace dark matter. The total stellar mass in satellites is
proportional to the virial mass of the host halo, $M_{200}$, for ICGs more massive than $10^{10.5}M_\odot$,
i.e., $M_{\ast,\mathrm{sat}} \propto M_{200}$, whereas the relation between the stellar mass
of ICGs $+$ stellar halos and $M_{200}$ is close to $M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG+diffuse}}\propto M_{200}^{1/2}$.
Below $10^{10.5}M_\odot$, the change in $M_{200}$ is much slower with the decrease in $M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG+diffuse}}$.
At fixed stellar mass, red ICGs are hosted by more massive dark matter halos and have more satellites.
At $M_{200}\sim10^{12.7}M_\odot$, both $M_{\ast,\mathrm{sat}}$ and the fraction of stellar
mass in satellites versus total stellar mass, $f_\mathrm{sat}$, tend to be slightly higher around
blue ICGs, perhaps implying the late formation of blue galaxies. $f_\mathrm{sat}$ increases with
the increase in both $M_{\ast,\mathrm{ICG+diffuse}}$ and $M_{200}$, and scales more linearly
with $M_{200}$. We provide best-fitting formulas for these scaling relations and for red and blue
ICGs separately.

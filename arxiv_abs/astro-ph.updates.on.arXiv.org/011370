We perform a linear analysis of the stability of isothermal, rotating, magnetic, self-gravitating
sheets that are weakly ionized. The magnetic field and rotation axis are perpendicular to the sheet.
We include a self-consistent treatment of thermal pressure, gravitational, rotational, and magnetic
(pressure and tension) forces together with two nonideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) effects (Ohmic
dissipation and ambipolar diffusion) that are treated together for their influence on the properties
of gravitational instability for a rotating sheet-like cloud or disk. Our results show that there
is always a preferred lengthscale and associated minimum timescale for gravitational instability.
We investigate their dependence on important dimensionless free parameters of the problem: the
initial normalized mass-to-flux ratio $\mu_0$, the rotational Toomre parameter $Q$, the dimensionless
Ohmic diffusivity $\tilde{\eta}_{\rm OD,0}$, and the dimensionless neutral-ion collision time
$\tilde{\tau}_{\rm{ni,0}}$ that is a measure of the ambipolar diffusivity. One consequence of
$\tilde{\eta}_{\rm OD,0}$ is that there is a maximum preferred lengthscale of instability that
occurs in the transcritical ($\mu_0 \gtrsim 1$) regime, qualitatively similar to the effect of
$\tilde{\tau}_{\rm{ni,0}}$, but with quantitative differences. The addition of rotation leads
to a generalized Toomre criterion (that includes a magnetic dependence) and modified lengthscales
and timescales for collapse. When nonideal MHD effects are also included, the Toomre criterion
reverts back to the hydrodynamic value. We apply our results to protostellar disk properties in
the early embedded phase and find that the preferred scale of instability can significantly exceed
the thermal (Jeans) scale and the peak preferred fragmentation mass is likely to be $\sim 10- 90 \
M_{\rm Jup}$.

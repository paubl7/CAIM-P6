We conduct a comprehensive and statistical study of the luminosity functions (LFs) for satellite
galaxies, by counting photometric galaxies from HSC, DECaLS and SDSS around isolated central galaxies
(ICGs) and paired galaxies from the SDSS/DR7 spectroscopic sample. Results of different surveys
show very good agreement. The satellite LFs can be measured down to $M_V\sim-10$, and for central
primary galaxies as small as $8.5<\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot<9.2$ and $9.2<\log_{10}M_\ast/M_\odot<9.9$,
implying there are on average 3--8 satellites with $M_V<-10$ around LMC-mass ICGs. The bright end
cutoff of satellite LFs and the satellite abundance are both sensitive to the magnitude gap between
the primary and its companions, indicating galaxy systems with larger magnitude gaps are on average
hosted by less massive dark matter haloes. By selecting primaries with stellar mass similar to our
MW, we discovered that i) the averaged satellite LFs of ICGs with different magnitude gaps to their
companions and of galaxy pairs with different colour or colour combinations all show steeper slopes
than the MW satellite LF; ii) there are on average more satellites with $-15<M_V<-10$ than those
in our MW; iii) there are on average 1.5 to 2.5 satellites with $M_V<-16$ around ICGs, consistent
with our MW; iv) even after accounting for the large scatter predicted by numerical simulations,
the MW satellite LF is uncommon at $M_V>-12$. Hence the MW and its satellite system are statistically
atypical of our sample of MW-mass systems. In consequence, our MW is not a good representative of
other MW-mass galaxies. Strong cosmological implications based on only MW satellites await additional
discoveries of fainter satellites in extra-galactic systems. Interestingly, the MW satellite
LF is typical among other MW-mass systems within 40~Mpc in the local Universe, perhaps implying
the Local Volume is an under-dense region.

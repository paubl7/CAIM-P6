Hydrodynamical cosmological simulations are increasing their level of realism by considering
more physical processes and having greater resolution or larger statistics. However, usually
either the statistical power of such simulations or the resolution reached within galaxies are
sacrificed. Here, we introduce the NewHorizon project in which we simulate at high resolution a
zoom-in region of $\sim(16\,\rm Mpc)^3$ that is larger than a standard zoom-in region around a single
halo and is embedded in a larger box. A resolution of up to 34 pc is reached within galaxies; this allows
the simulation to capture the multi-phase nature of the interstellar medium and the clumpy nature
of the star formation process in galaxies. In this introductory paper, we present several key fundamental
properties of galaxies and their black holes, including the galaxy mass function, cosmic star formation
rate, galactic metallicities, the Kennicutt-Schmidt relation, the stellar-to-halo mass relation,
galaxy sizes, stellar kinematics and morphology, gas content within galaxies and its kinematics,
and the black hole mass and spin properties over time. The various scaling relations are broadly
reproduced by NewHorizon with some differences with the standard observables. Owing to its exquisite
spatial resolution, NewHorizon captures the inefficient process of star formation in galaxies,
which evolve over time from being more turbulent, gas rich, and star bursting at high redshift. These
high-redshift galaxies are also more compact, and they are more elliptical and clumpier until the
level of internal gas turbulence decays enough to allow for the formation of discs. The NewHorizon
simulation gives access to a broad range of galaxy formation and evolution physics at low-to-intermediate
stellar masses, which is a regime that will become accessible in the near future through surveys
such as the LSST.

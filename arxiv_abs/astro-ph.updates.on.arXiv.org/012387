We present a mechanism for accelerated expansion of the universe in the generic case of negative-curvature
compactifications of M-theory, with minimal ingredients. M-theory on a hyperbolic manifold with
small closed geodesics supporting Casimir energy -- along with a single classical source (7-form
flux) -- contains an immediate 3-term structure for volume stabilization at positive potential
energy. Hyperbolic manifolds are well-studied mathematically, with an important rigidity property
at fixed volume. They and their Dehn fillings to more general Einstein spaces exhibit explicit discrete
parameters that yield small closed geodesics supporting Casimir energy. The off-shell effective
potential derived by M. Douglas incorporates the warped product structure via the constraints
of general relativity, screening negative energy. Analyzing the fields sourced by the localized
Casimir energy and the available discrete choices of manifolds and fluxes, we find a regime where
the net curvature, Casimir energy, and flux compete at large radius and stabilize the volume. Further
metric and form field deformations are highly constrained by hyperbolic rigidity and warping effects,
leading to calculations giving strong indications of a positive Hessian, and residual tadpoles
are small. We test this via explicit back reacted solutions and perturbations in patches including
the Dehn filling regions, initiate a neural network study of further aspects of the internal fields,
and derive a Maldacena-Nunez style no-go theorem for Anti-de Sitter extrema. A simple generalization
incorporating 4-form flux produces axion monodromy inflation. As a relatively simple de Sitter
uplift of the large-N M2-brane theory, the construction applies to de Sitter holography as well
as to cosmological modeling, and introduces new connections between mathematics and the physics
of string/M theory compactifications.

Since its discovery in 1963, 3C273 has become one of the most widely studied quasars with investigations
spanning the electromagnetic spectrum. While much has been discovered about this historically
notable source, its low-frequency emission is far less well understood. Observations in the MHz
regime have traditionally lacked the resolution required to explore small-scale structures that
are key to understanding the processes that result in the observed emission. In this paper we use
the first sub-arcsecond images of 3C273 at MHz frequencies to investigate the morphology of the
compact jet structures and the processes that result in the observed spectrum. Using the full complement
of LOFAR's international stations, we produce $0.31 \times 0.21$ arcsec images of 3C273 at 150 MHz
to determine the jet's kinetic power, place constraints on the bulk speed and inclination angle
of the jets, and look for evidence of the elusive counter-jet at 150 MHz. Using ancillary data at GHz
frequencies, we fit free-free absorption (FFA) and synchrotron self-absorption (SSA) models
to determine their validity in explaining the observed spectra. The images presented display for
the first time that robust, high-fidelity imaging of low-declination complex sources is now possible
with the LOFAR international baselines. We show that the main small-scale structures of 3C273 match
those seen at higher frequencies and that absorption is present in the observed emission. We determine
the kinetic power of the jet to be in the range of $3.5 \times 10^{43}$ - $1.5 \times 10^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$
which agrees with estimates made using higher frequency observations. We derive lower limits for
the bulk speed and Lorentz factor of $\beta \gtrsim 0.55$ and $\Gamma \geq 1.2$ respectively. The
counter-jet remains undetected at $150$ MHz, placing a limit on the peak brightness of $S_\mathrm{cj\_150}
< 40$ mJy beam$^{-1}$.

Outflows accelerated by AGN are commonly observed in the form of coherent, mildly collimated high-velocity
gas directed along the AGN ionisation cones and kinetically powerful (>$10^{44-45}$ erg/s) jets.
Recent works found that outflows can also be accelerated by low-power (<$10^{44}$ erg/s) jets,
and the most recent cosmological simulations indicate that these are the dominant source of feedback
on sub-kpc scales. We study the relation between radio jets and the distribution and kinematics
of the ionised gas in IC 5063, NGC 5643, NGC 1068, and NGC 1386 as part of our MAGNUM survey of nearby
Seyfert galaxies. All these objects host a small-scale (<1 kpc) low-power (<$10^{44}$ erg/s) radio
jet that has small inclinations (<45\deg) with respect to the galaxy disc. We employed seeing-limited
optical integral field spectroscopic observations from MUSE at VLT to obtain flux, kinematic,
and excitation maps of the extended ionised gas, that we compared with archival radio images and
Chandra X-ray observations. We detect a strong (up to >800-1000 km/s), extended (>1 kpc) and shock-excited
emission-line velocity spread perpendicular to the AGN ionisation cones and jets in all four targets.
These broad and symmetric line profiles are not associated with a single coherent velocity of the
gas, differently from the 'classical' asymmetric-line outflow observed along the ionisation
cones and jets. We interpret the observed phenomenon as due to the action of the jets perturbing the
gas in the galaxy disc. These intense and extended velocity spreads perpendicular to AGN jets and
cones are indeed currently only observed in galaxies hosting a low-power jet whose inclination
is sufficiently low with respect to the galaxy disc to impact on and strongly affect its material.
In line with cosmological simulations, our results demonstrate that low-power jets are indeed
capable of affecting the host galaxy.

We present observations of two bright M dwarfs (TOI-1634 and TOI-1685: $J=9.5-9.6$) hosting ultra-short
period (USP) planets, identified by the TESS mission. The two stars are similar in temperature,
mass, and radius ($T_\mathrm{eff}\,\approx\,3500$ K, $M_\star\,\approx\,0.45-0.46\,M_\odot$,
and $R_\star\approx 0.45-0.46\,R_\odot$), and the planets are both super-Earth-sized ($1.25\,R_\oplus<R_p<2.0\,R_\oplus$).
For both systems, light curves from the ground-based photometry exhibit planetary transits, whose
depths are consistent with those by the TESS photometry. We also refine the transit ephemerides
based on the ground-based photometry, finding the orbital periods of $P=0.9893436\pm0.0000020$
day and $P=0.6691416\pm0.0000019$ day for TOI-1634b and TOI-1685b, respectively. Through intensive
radial velocity (RV) observations using IRD on the Subaru 8.2m telescope, we confirm the planetary
nature of the TOIs, and measure their masses: $10.14\pm0.95\,M_\oplus$ and $3.43\pm0.93\,M_\oplus$
for TOI-1634b and TOI-1685b, respectively, when the observed RVs are fitted with a single-planet
circular-orbit model. Combining those with the planet radii of $R_p=1.749\pm 0.079\,R_\oplus$
(TOI-1634b) and $1.459\pm0.065\,R_\oplus$ (TOI-1685b), we find that both USP planets have mean
densities consistent with an Earth-like internal composition, which is typical for small USP planets.
TOI-1634b is currently the most massive USP planet in this category, and it resides near the radius
valley, which makes it a benchmark planet in the context of discussing the size limit of rocky planet
cores as well as testing the formation scenarios for USP planets. Excess scatter in the RV residuals
for TOI-1685 suggests the presence of a possible secondary planet or unknown activity/instrumental
noise in the RV data, but further observations are required to check those possibilities.

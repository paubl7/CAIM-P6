Although the real shapes and trajectories of erupting solar prominences in three dimensions have
been intensively studied, the three-dimensional (3D) shapes of stable prominences before eruptions
have not been measured accurately so far. We intend to make such a measurement to constrain 3D prominence
models and to extend our knowledge of prominences. Using multiperspective observations from the
Atmospheric Imaging Assembly on board SDO and the Extreme Ultraviolet Imager on board STEREO, we
reconstructed 3D coordinates of three stable prominences: a quiescent, an intermediate, and a
mixed type. Based on the 3D coordinates, we measured the height, length, and inclination angle of
the legs of these prominences. To study the spatial relationship between the footpoints of prominences
and photospheric magnetic structures, we also used the Global Oscillation Network Group H alpha
images and magnetograms from the HMI on board the SDO. In three stable prominences, we find that the
axes of the prominence legs are inclined by 68 degrees on average to the solar surface. Legs at different
locations along a prominence axis have different heights with a two- to threefold difference. Our
investigation suggests that over 96% of prominence footpoints in a sample of 70 footpoints are located
at supergranular boundaries. The widths of two legs have similar values measured in two orthogonal
lines of sight. We also find that a prominence leg above the solar limb showed horizontal oscillations
with larger amplitudes at higher locations. With a limited image resolution and number of cases,
our measurement suggests that the legs of prominences may have various orientations and do not always
stand vertically on the surface of the sun. Moreover, the locations of prominence legs are closely
related to supergranules.

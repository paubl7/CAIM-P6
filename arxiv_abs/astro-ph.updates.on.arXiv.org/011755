Although thousands of galaxy mergers are known, only a handful of sub-kiloparsec-scale supermassive
black hole (SMBH) pairs have been confirmed so far, leaving a huge gap between the observed and predicted
numbers of such objects. In this work, we present a detailed analysis of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
optical spectrum and of near-infrared (NIR) diffraction limited imaging of SDSS~J1431+4358.
This object is a local radio-quiet type 2 active galactic nucleus (AGN) previously selected as a
double AGN candidate on the basis of the double-peaked [OIII] emission line. The NIR adaptive optics-assisted
observations were obtained at the Large Binocular Telescope with the LUCI+FLAO camera. We found
that most of the prominent optical emission lines are characterized by a double-peaked profile,
mainly produced by AGN photoionization. Our spectroscopical analysis disfavors the hypothesis
that the double-peaked emission lines in the source are the signatures of outflow kinematics, leaving
open the possibility that we are detecting either the rotation of a single narrow-line region or
the presence of two SMBHs orbiting around a common central potential. The latter scenario is further
supported by the high-spatial resolution NIR imaging: after subtracting the dominant contribution
of the stellar bulge component in the host galaxy, we detect two faint nuclear sources at r<0.5 kpc
projected separation. Interestingly, the two sources have a position angle consistent with that
defined by the two regions where the [OIII] double peaks most likely originate. Aside from the discovery
of a promising sub-kiloparsec scale dual AGN, our analysis shows the importance of an appropriate
host galaxy subtraction in order to achieve a reliable estimate of the incidence of dual AGNs at small
projected separations.

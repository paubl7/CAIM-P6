The supernova remnant (SNR) G150.3+4.5 was recently discovered in the radio band; it exhibits a
shell-like morphology with an angular size of $\sim 3^{\circ}$, suggesting either an old or a nearby
SNR. Extended $\gamma$-ray emission spatially coincident with the SNR was reported in the Fermi
Galactic Extended Source Catalog, with a power-law spectral index of $\Gamma$ = 1.91 $\pm$ 0.09.
Studying particle acceleration in SNRs through their $\gamma$-ray emission is of primary concern
to assess the nature of accelerated particles and the maximum energy they can reach. Using more than
ten years of Fermi-LAT data, we investigate the morphological and spectral properties of the SNR
G150.3+4.5 from 300 MeV to 3 TeV. We use the latest releases of the Fermi-LAT catalog, the instrument
response functions and the Galactic and isotropic diffuse emissions. We use ROSAT all-sky survey
data to assess any thermal and nonthermal X-ray emission, and we derive minimum and maximum distance
to G150.3+4.5. We describe the $\gamma$-ray emission of G150.3+4.5 by an extended component which
is found to be spatially coincident with the radio SNR. The spectrum is hard and the detection of photons
up to hundreds of GeV points towards an emission from a dynamically young SNR. The lack of X-ray emission
gives a tight constraint on the ambient density $n_0 \leq 3.6 \times 10^{-3}$ cm$^{-3}$. Since G150.3+4.5
is not reported as a historical SNR, we impose a lower limit on its age of $t$ = 1 kyr. We estimate its
distance to be between 0.7 and 4.5 kpc. We find that G150.3+4.5 is spectrally similar to other dynamically
young and shell-type SNRs, such as RX J1713.7$-$3946 or Vela Junior. The broadband nonthermal emission
is explained with a leptonic scenario, implying a downstream magnetic field of $B = 5$ $\mu$G and
acceleration of particles up to few TeV energies.

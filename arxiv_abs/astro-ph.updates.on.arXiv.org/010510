To study the early phases of massive star formation, we present ALMA observations of SiO(5-4) emission
and VLA observations of 6 cm continuum emission towards 32 Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC) clumps, which
are spatially resolved down to $\lesssim 0.05$ pc. Out of the 32 clumps observed, we have detected
SiO emission in 20 clumps, and in 11 of them it is relatively strong and likely tracing protostellar
outflows. Some SiO outflows are collimated, while others are less well ordered. There is evidence
for episodic ejection events, as well as multiple outflows originating from scales of $\lesssim
0.1$ pc. For the six strongest SiO outflows, we estimate basic outflow properties. We do not see clear
dependence of the degree of collimation of the outflows on core mass, luminosity and evolutionary
stage. In our entire sample, where there is SiO emission, we always find 1.3 mm continuum emission
and some infrared emission nearby, but not vice versa. We build the spectral energy distributions
(SEDs) of all the cores with 1.3 mm continuum emission and fit them with radiative transfer (RT) models.
The low luminosities and stellar masses returned by SED fitting suggest these are early stage protostars.
We see a slight trend of increasing SiO line luminosity with bolometric luminosity, which suggests
more powerful shocks in the vicinity of more massive YSOs. However, we do not see a clear relation
between the SiO luminosity and the evolutionary stage indicated by $L/M$. We conclude that as a protostar
approaches a bolometric luminosity of $\sim 10^2 \: L_{\odot}$, the shocks in the outflow are generally
strong enough to form SiO emission. The VLA 6 cm observations toward the 15 clumps with the strongest
SiO emission detect emission in four clumps, which is likely to be shock ionized jets associated
with the more massive of these protostellar cores.

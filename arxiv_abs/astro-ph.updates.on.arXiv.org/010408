The standard model of particle physics is known to be intriguingly successful. However their rich
phenomena represented by the phase transitions (PTs) have not been completely understood yet,
including the possibility of the existence of unknown dark sectors. In this Letter, we investigate
the measurement of the equation of state parameter $w$ and the sound speed $c_{\rm s}$ of the PT plasma
with use of the gravitational waves (GWs) of the universe. Though the propagation of GW is insensitive
to $c_{\rm s}$ in itself, the sound speed value affects the dynamics of primordial density (or scalar
curvature) perturbations and the induced GW by their horizon reentry can then be an indirect probe
both $w$ and $c_{\rm s}$. We numerically reveal the concrete spectrum of the predicted induced GW
with two simple examples of the scalar perturbation spectrum: the monochromatic and scale-invariant
spectra. In the monochromatic case, we see that the resonant amplification and cancellation scales
of the induced GW depend on the $c_{\rm s}$ values at different time respectively. The scale-invariant
case gives a more realistic spectrum and its specific shape will be compared with observations.
In particular, the QCD phase transition corresponds with the frequency range of the pulsar timing
array (PTA) observations. If the amplitude of primordial scalar power is in the range of $10^{-4}\lesssim
A_\zeta\lesssim10^{-2}$, the induced GW is consistent with current observational constraints
and detectable in the future observation in Square Kilometer Array. Futhermore the recent possible
detection of stochastic GWs by NANOGrav 12.5 yr analysis~[1] can be explained by the induced GW if
$A_\zeta\sim\sqrt{7}\times10^{-3}$.

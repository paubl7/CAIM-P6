Anisotropies in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) are primarily generated by Thomson scattering
of photons by free electrons. Around recombination, the Thomson scattering probability quickly
diminishes as the free electrons combine with protons to form neutral hydrogen off which CMB photons
can scatter through Rayleigh scattering. Unlike Thomson scattering, Rayleigh scattering is frequency
dependent resulting in the generation of anisotropies with a different spectral dependence. Unfortunately
the Rayleigh scattering efficiency rapidly decreases with the expansion of the neutral universe,
with the result that only a small percentage of photons are scattered by neutral hydrogen. Although
the effect is very small, future CMB missions with higher sensitivity and improved frequency coverage
are poised to measure Rayleigh scattering signal. The uncorrelated component of the Rayleigh anisotropies
contains unique information on the primordial perturbations that could potentially be leveraged
to expand our knowledge of the early universe. In this paper we explore whether measurements of Rayleigh
scattering anisotropies can be used to constrain primordial non-Gaussianity (NG) and examine
the hints of anomalies found by WMAP and \textit{Planck} satellites. We show that the additional
Rayleigh information has the potential to improve primordial NG constraints by $30\%$, or more.
Primordial bispectra that are not of the local type benefit the most from these additional scatterings,
which we attribute to the different scale dependence of the Rayleigh anisotropies. Unfortunately
this different scaling means that Rayleigh measurements can not be used to constrain anomalies
or features on large scales. On the other hand, anomalies that may persist to smaller scales, such
as the potential power asymmetry seen in WMAP and \textit{Planck}, could be improved by the addition
of Rayleigh measurements.

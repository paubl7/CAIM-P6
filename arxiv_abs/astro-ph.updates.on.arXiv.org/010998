Strong gravitational lensing provides a wealth of astrophysical information on the baryonic and
dark matter content of galaxies. It also serves as a valuable cosmological probe by allowing us to
measure the Hubble constant independently of other methods. These applications all require the
difficult task of inverting the lens equation and simultaneously reconstructing the mass profile
of the lens along with the original light profile of the unlensed source. As there is no reason for
either the lens or the source to be simple, we need methods that both invert the lens equation with
a large number of degrees of freedom and also enforce a well-controlled regularisation that avoids
the appearance of spurious structures. This can be beautifully accomplished by representing signals
in wavelet space. Building on the Sparse Lens Inversion Technique (SLIT), in this work we present
an improved sparsity-based method that describes lensed sources using wavelets and optimises
over the parameters given an analytical lens mass profile. We apply our technique on simulated HST
and E-ELT data, as well as on real HST images of lenses from the Sloan Lens ACS (SLACS) sample, assuming
a lens model. We show that wavelets allow us to reconstruct lensed sources containing detailed substructures
when using both present-day data and high-resolution images from future thirty-meter-class telescopes.
Wavelets moreover provide a much more tractable solution in terms of quality and computation time
compared to using a source model that combines smooth analytical profiles and shapelets. Requiring
very little human interaction, our pixel-based technique fits into the effort to devise automated
modelling schemes. It can be incorporated in the standard workflow of sampling analytical lens
model parameters. The method, which we call SLITronomy, is freely available as a new plug-in to the
modelling software Lenstronomy.

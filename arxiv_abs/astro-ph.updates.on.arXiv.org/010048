We present an optical analysis of 55 members of R136, the central cluster in the Tarantula Nebula
of the Large Magellanic Cloud. Our sample was observed with STIS aboard the Hubble Space Telescope,
is complete down to about 40\,$M_{\odot}$, and includes 7 very massive stars with masses over 100\,$M_{\odot}$.
We performed a spectroscopic analysis to derive their physical properties. Using evolutionary
models we find that the initial mass function (IMF) of massive stars in R136 is suggestive of being
top-heavy with a power-law exponent $\gamma \approx 2 \pm 0.3$, but steeper exponents cannot be
excluded. The age of R136 lies between 1 and 2\,Myr with a median age of around 1.6\,Myr. Stars more
luminous than $\log L/L_{\odot} = 6.3$ are helium enriched and their evolution is dominated by mass
loss, but rotational mixing or some other form of mixing could be still required to explain the helium
composition at the surface. Stars more massive than 40\,$M_{\odot}$ have larger spectroscopic
than evolutionary masses. The slope of the wind-luminosity relation assuming unclumped stellar
winds is $2.41\pm0.13$ which is steeper than usually obtained ($\sim 1.8$). The ionising ($\log
Q_0\,[{\rm ph/s}] = 51.4$) and mechanical ($\log L_{\rm SW}\,[{\rm erg/s}] = 39.1$) output of R136
is dominated by the most massive stars ($>100\,M_{\odot}$). R136 contributes around a quarter
of the ionising flux and around a fifth of the mechanical feedback to the overall budget of the Tarantula
Nebula. For a census of massive stars of the Tarantula Nebula region we combined our results with
the VLT-FLAMES Tarantula Survey plus other spectroscopic studies. We observe a lack of evolved
Wolf-Rayet stars and luminous blue and red supergiants.

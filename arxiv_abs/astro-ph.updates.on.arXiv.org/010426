LHS 1140 is an M dwarf known to host two known transiting planets at orbital periods of 3.77 and 24.7
days. The external planet (LHS 1140 b) is a rocky super-Earth that is located in the middle of the habitable
zone of this low-mass star, placing this system at the forefront of the habitable exoplanet exploration.
We further characterize this system by improving the physical and orbital properties and search
for additional planetary-mass components in the system, also exploring the possibility of co-orbitals.
We collected 113 new radial velocity observations with ESPRESSO over a 1.5-year time span with an
average photon-noise precision of 1.07 m/s. We determine new masses with a precision of 6% for LHS
1140 b ($6.48 \pm 0.46~M_{\oplus}$) and 9% for LHS 1140 c ($m_c=1.78 \pm 0.17~M_{\oplus}$), reducing
by half the previously published uncertainties. Although both planets have Earth-like bulk compositions,
the internal structure analysis suggests that LHS 1140 b might be iron-enriched. In both cases,
the water content is compatible to a maximum fraction of 10-12% in mass, which is equivalent to a deep
ocean layer of $779 \pm 650$ km for the habitable-zone planet LHS 1140 b. Our results also provide
evidence for a new planet candidate in the system ($m_d= 4.8\pm1.1~M_{\oplus}$) on a ~78.9-day
orbital period, which is detected through three independent methods. The analysis also allows
us to discard other planets above 0.5 $M_{\oplus}$ for periods shorter than 10 days and above 2 $M_{\oplus}$
for periods up to one year. Finally, our analysis discards co-orbital planets of LHS 1140 b down to
1 $M_{\oplus}$. Indications for a possible co-orbital signal in LHS 1140 c are detected in both radial
velocity and photometric data, however. The new characterization of the system make it a key target
for atmospheric studies of rocky worlds at different stellar irradiations

We investigate the spatial distribution of star formation (SF) within bars of nearby disk galaxies
(inclination $< 65^{\circ}$) from the S$^4$G survey. We use archival GALEX far- and near-UV imaging
for 772 barred galaxies. We also assemble a compilation of continuum-subtracted H$\alpha$ images
for 433 barred galaxies, of which 70 are produced by ourselves from ancillary photometry and MUSE/CALIFA
IFU data cubes. We employ two complementary approaches: i) the analysis of bar/disk stacks built
from co-added UV images of hundreds of galaxies; and ii) the classification of the morphology of
ionised regions in galaxies into three main SF classes: A) only circumnuclear SF, B) SF at the bar
ends, but not along the bar, and C) SF along the bar. Lenticular galaxies typically belong to SF class
A: this is probably related to bar-induced SF quenching. The distribution of SF class B peaks for
early- and intermediate-type spirals: this most likely results from the interplay of gas flow,
shocks, and enhanced shear in centrally concentrated galaxies with large bar amplitudes. Late-type
galaxies are mainly assigned to SF class C: we argue that this is a consequence of low shear. In bar
stacks of spirals, the UV emission traces the stellar bars and dominates on their leading side, as
witnessed in simulations. For early-types, the central UV emission is $\sim$0.5 mag brighter in
strongly barred galaxies, relative to their weakly barred counterparts: this is related to the
efficiency of strong bars sweeping the disk gas and triggering central starbursts. We also show
that the distributions of SF in inner ringed galaxies are broadly the same in barred and non-barred
galaxies, including a UV/H$\alpha$ deficit in the middle part of the bar: this hints at the effect
of resonance rings trapping gas. Distinct distributions of SF within bars are reported in galaxies
of different morphological types (Abridged).

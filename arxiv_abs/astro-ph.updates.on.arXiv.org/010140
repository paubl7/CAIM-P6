Spectral lines from N-like ions can be used to measure the temperature and density of various types
of astrophysical plasmas. The atomic databases of astrophysical plasma modelling codes still
have room for improvement in their electron-impact excitation data sets for N-like ions, especially
$R$-matrix data. This is particularly relevant for future observatories (e.g. Arcus) which will
host high-resolution spectrometers. We aim to obtain level-resolved effective collision strengths
for all transitions up to $nl=5d$ over a wide range of temperatures for N-like ions from O II to Zn XXIV
(i.e., O$^{+}$ to Zn$^{23+}$) and to assess the accuracy of the present work. We also examine the
impact of our new data on plasma diagnostics by modelling solar observations with CHIANTI. We have
carried-out systematic $R$-matrix calculations for N-like ions which included 725 fine-structure
target levels in both the configuration interaction target and close-coupling collision expansions.
The $R$-matrix intermediate coupling frame transformation method was used to calculate the collision
strengths, while the AUTOSTRUCTURE code was used for the atomic structures. We compare the present
results for selected ions with those in archival databases and the literature. The comparison covers
energy levels, oscillator strengths, and effective collision strengths. We show examples of improved
plasma diagnostics when compared to CHIANTI models which use only distorted wave data as well as
some which use previous $R$-matrix data. The electron-impact excitation data are archived according
to the Atomic Data and Analysis Structure (ADAS) data class it adf04 and will be available in OPEN-ADAS.
The data can be used to improve the atomic databases for astrophysical plasma diagnostics.

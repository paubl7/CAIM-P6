We present predictions for the extent of the dust-continuum emission of thousands of main-sequence
galaxies drawn from the TNG50 simulation between $z=1-5$. To this aim, we couple the radiative transfer
code SKIRT to the output of the TNG50 simulation and measure the dust-continuum half-light radius
of the modeled galaxies, assuming a Milky Way dust type and a metallicity dependent dust-to-metal
ratio. The dust-continuum half-light radius at observed-frame 850 $\mu$m is up to $\sim$75 per
cent larger than the stellar half-mass radius, but significantly more compact than the observed-frame
1.6 $\mu$m (roughly corresponding to H-band) half-light radius, particularly towards high redshifts:
the compactness compared to the 1.6 $\mu$m emission increases with redshift. This is driven by obscuration
of stellar light from the galaxy centres, which increases the apparent extent of 1.6 $\mu$m disk
sizes relative to that at 850 $\mu$m. The difference in relative extents increases with redshift
because the observed-frame 1.6 $\mu$m emission stems from ever shorter wavelength stellar emission.
These results suggest that the compact dust-continuum emission observed in $z>1$ galaxies is not
(necessarily) evidence of the buildup of a dense central stellar component. We also find that the
dust-continuum half-light radius very closely follows the radius containing half the star formation
in galaxies, indicating that single band dust-continuum emission is a good tracer of the location
of (obscured) star formation. The dust-continuum emission is more compact than the H2 mass (for
galaxies at $z\geq 2$) and the underlying dust mass. The dust emission strongly correlates with
locations with the highest dust temperatures, which do not need to be the locations where most H$_2$
and/or dust is located. The presented results are a common feature of main-sequence galaxies.

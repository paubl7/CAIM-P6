The recent gravitational-wave transient GW190521 has been interpreted by the LIGO-Virgo collaboration
(LVC) as sourced by a binary black hole (BH) merger. According to the LVC parameter estimation, at
least one of these progenitors falls into the so-called pair-instability supernova mass gap. This
raises the important question of how and when these progenitors \textit{formed}. In this paper,
we use a relativistic accretion model obtained from General Relativity hydrodynamics simulations
to analyze the scenario wherein the GW190521 original progenitors (OPs) formed at lower masses
(and spins) and grew to their estimated LVC parameters by relativistic accretion. We consider that
the environment wherein the binary is immersed has density gradients as well as a dependence on the
Mach number of the gas. Taking the LVC parameter estimation at $z=0.82$ as the endpoint of the accretion
evolution, we estimate the initial masses and spins of the OPs at three different red shifts $z=100,
\ 50$, and $20$. We found three distinct possible types of OPs: $(i)$ $10^{-4} M_{\odot} - 3 M_{\odot}$
almost non-rotating (with Kerr spin parameter $a_{\star}< 10^{-2}$) primordial BHs; $(ii)$ $3
M_{\odot} - 40M_{\odot}$ slowly rotating ($ 10^{-2} < a_{\star} < 0.5$) stellar-mass BHs; $(iii)$
$40M_{\odot} - 70M_{\odot}$ BHs with a moderate spin parameter $a_{\star}\sim 0.5$, which could
originate from the collapse of high mass Pop III stars. The mass spread is due to varying the density
gradient and the relativistic Mach number of the cosmic plasma; the variation of the masses due to
the origin at different red shifts, on the other hand, is negligible, $\sim 2\%$. For high Mach number
scenarios, the BHs have low mass and spin accretion rates, leading to OPs with masses and spins close
to the GW190521 LVC estimated values. . .

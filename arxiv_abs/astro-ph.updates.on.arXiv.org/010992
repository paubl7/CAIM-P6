The NASA LISA Study Team was tasked to study how NASA might support US scientists to participate and
maximize the science return from the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) mission. LISA is
gravitational wave observatory led by ESA with NASA as a junior partner, and is scheduled to launch
in 2034. Among our findings: LISA science productivity is greatly enhanced by a full-featured US
science center and an open access data model. As other major missions have demonstrated, a science
center acts as both a locus and an amplifier of research innovation, data analysis, user support,
user training and user interaction. In its most basic function, a US Science Center could facilitate
entry into LISA science by hosting a Data Processing Center and a portal for the US community to access
LISA data products. However, an enhanced LISA Science Center could: support one of the parallel
independent processing pipelines required for data product validation; stimulate the high level
of research on data analysis that LISA demands; support users unfamiliar with a novel observatory;
facilitate astrophysics and fundamental research; provide an interface into the subtleties of
the instrument to validate extraordinary discoveries; train new users; and expand the research
community through guest investigator, postdoc and student programs. Establishing a US LISA Science
Center well before launch can have a beneficial impact on the participation of the broader astronomical
community by providing training, hosting topical workshops, disseminating mock catalogs, software
pipelines, and documentation. Past experience indicates that successful science centers are
established several years before launch; this early adoption model may be especially relevant
for a pioneering mission like LISA.

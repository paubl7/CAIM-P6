The 21-cm line of neutral hydrogen (HI) opens a new avenue in our exploration of the Universe's structure
and evolution. It provides complementary data with different systematics, which aim to improve
our current understanding of the $\Lambda$CDM model. Among several radio cosmological surveys
designed to measure this line, BINGO is a single dish telescope mainly designed to detect Baryon
Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) at low redshifts ($0.127 < z < 0.449$). Our goal is to assess the capabilities
of the fiducial BINGO setup to constrain the cosmological parameters and analyse the effect of different
instrument configurations. We will use the 21-cm angular power spectra to extract information
about the HI signal and the Fisher matrix formalism to study BINGO projected constraining power.
We use the Phase 1 fiducial configuration of the BINGO telescope to perform our cosmological forecasts.
In addition, we investigate the impact of several instrumental setups and different cosmological
models. Combining BINGO with Planck temperature and polarization data, we project a $1\%$ and a
$3\%$ precision measurement at $68\%$ CL for the Hubble constant and the dark energy (DE) equation
of state (EoS), respectively, within the wCDM model. Assuming a CPL parametrization, the EoS parameters
have standard deviations given by $\sigma_{w_0} = 0.30$ and $\sigma_{w_a} = 1.2$. We find that BINGO
can also help breaking degeneracies in alternative models, which improves the cosmological constraints
significantly. Moreover, we can access information about the HI density and bias, obtaining $\sim
8.5\%$ and $\sim 6\%$ precision, respectively, assuming they vary with redshift at three independent
bins. The fiducial BINGO configuration will be able to extract significant information from the
HI distribution and provide constraints competitive with current and future cosmological surveys.

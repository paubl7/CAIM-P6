We study the relative helicity of active region (AR) NOAA~12673 during a ten-hour time interval
centered around a preceding X2.2 flare (SOL2017-09-06T08:57) and also including an eruptive X9.3
flare that occurred three hours later (SOL2017-09-06T11:53). In particular, we aim for a reliable
estimate of the normalized self-helicity of the current-carrying magnetic field, the so-called
helicity ratio $|H_{\mathrm{J}}|/|H_{\mathcal{V}}|$, a promising candidate to quantity the
eruptive potential of solar ARs. Using SDO/HMI vector magnetic field data as an input, we employ
nonlinear force-free (NLFF) coronal magnetic field models using an optimization approach. The
corresponding relative helicity, and related quantities, are computed using a finite-volume
method. From multiple time series of NLFF models based on different choices of free model parameters,
we are able to assess the spread of $|H_{\mathrm{J}}|/|H_{\mathcal{V}}|$, and to estimate its
uncertainty. In comparison to earlier works, which identified the non-solenoidal contribution
to the total magnetic energy, $E_{\rm div}/E$, as selection criterion regarding the required solenoidal
quality of magnetic field models for subsequent relative helicity analysis, we propose to use in
addition the non-solenoidal contribution to the free magnetic energy, $|E_{\rm mix}|/E_{\mathrm{J,s}}$.
As a recipe for a reliable estimate of the relative magnetic helicity (and related quantities),
we recommend to employ multiple NLFF models based on different combinations of free model parameters,
to retain only those that exhibit smallest values of both $E_{\rm div}/E$ and $|E_{\rm mix}|/E_{\mathrm{J,s}}$
at a certain time instant, to subsequently compute mean estimates, and to use the spread of the individually
contributing values as an indication for the uncertainty.

All estimators of the two-point correlation function are based on a random catalogue, a set of points
with no intrinsic clustering following the selection function of a survey. High-accuracy estimates
require the use of large random catalogues, which imply a high computational cost. We propose to
replace the standard random catalogues by glass-like point distributions or glass catalogues,
which are characterized by a power spectrum $P(k)\propto k^4$ and exhibit significantly less power
than a Poisson distribution with the same number of points on scales larger than the mean inter-particle
separation. We show that these distributions can be obtained by iteratively applying the technique
of Zeldovich reconstruction commonly used in studies of baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO). We
provide a modified version of the widely used Landy-Szalay estimator of the correlation function
adapted to the use of glass catalogues and compare its performance with the results obtained using
random samples. Our results show that glass-like samples do not add any bias with respect to the results
obtained using Poisson distributions. On scales larger than the mean inter-particle separation
of the glass catalogues, the modified estimator leads to a significant reduction of the variance
of the Legendre multipoles $\xi_\ell(s)$ with respect to the standard Landy-Szalay results with
the same number of points. The size of the glass catalogue required to achieve a given accuracy in
the correlation function is significantly smaller than when using random samples. Even considering
the small additional cost of constructing the glass catalogues, their use could help to drastically
reduce the computational cost of configuration-space clustering analysis of future surveys while
maintaining high-accuracy requirements.

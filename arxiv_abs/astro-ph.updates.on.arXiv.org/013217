Context. Clumping is a common property of stellar winds and is being incorporated to a solution of
the radiative transfer equation coupled with kinetic equilibrium equations. However, in static
hot model atmospheres, clumping and its influence on the temperature and density structures have
not been considered and analysed at all to date. This is in spite of the fact that clumping can influence
the interpretation of resulting spectra, as many inhomogeneities can appear there; for example,
as a result of turbulent motions. Aims. We aim to investigate the effects of clumping on atmospheric
structure for the special case of a static, spherically symmetric atmosphere assuming microclumping
and a 1-D geometry. Methods. Static, spherically symmetric, non-LTE (local thermodynamic equilibrium)
model atmospheres were calculated using the recent version of our code, which includes optically
thin clumping. The matter is assumed to consist of dense clumps and a void interclump medium. Clumping
is considered by means of clumping and volume filling factors, assuming all clumps are optically
thin. Enhanced opacity and emissivity in clumps is multiplied by a volume filling factor to obtain
their mean values. These mean values are used in the radiative transfer equation. Equations of kinetic
equilibrium and the thermal balance equation use clump values of densities. Equations of hydrostatic
and radiative equilibrium use mean values of densities. Results. The atmospheric structure was
calculated for selected stellar parameters. Moderate differences were found in temperature structure.
However, clumping causes enhanced continuum radiation for the Lyman-line spectral region, while
radiation in other parts of the spectrum is lower, depending on the adopted model. The atomic level
departure coefficients are influenced by clumping as well.

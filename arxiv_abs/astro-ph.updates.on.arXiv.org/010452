It has so far proven impossible to reproduce all aspects of the solar plage chromosphere in quasi-realistic
numerical models. The magnetic field configuration in the lower atmosphere is one of the few free
parameters in such simulations. The literature only offers proxy-based estimates of the field
strength, as it is difficult to obtain observational constraints in this region. Sufficiently
sensitive spectro-polarimetric measurements require a high signal-to-noise ratio, spectral
resolution, and cadence, which are at the limit of current capabilities. We use critically sampled
spectro-polarimetric observations of the \cair line obtained with the CRISP instrument of the
Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope to study the strength and inclination of the chromospheric magnetic
field of a plage region. This will provide direct physics-based estimates of these values, which
could aid modelers to put constraints on plage models. We increased the signal-to-noise ratio of
the data by applying several methods including deep learning and PCA. We estimated the noise level
to be $1\cdot10^{-3} I_c$. We then used STiC, a non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) inversion
code to infer the atmospheric structure and magnetic field pixel by pixel. We are able to infer the
magnetic field strength and inclination for a plage region and for fibrils in the surrounding canopy.
In the plage we report an absolute field strength of $|B| =440 \pm 90$ G, with an inclination of $10^\circ
\pm 16^\circ$ with respect to the local vertical. This value for $|B|$ is roughly double of what was
reported previously, while the inclination matches previous studies done in the photosphere.
In the fibrillar region we found $|B| = 300 \pm 50$ G, with an inclination of $50^\circ \pm 13^\circ$.

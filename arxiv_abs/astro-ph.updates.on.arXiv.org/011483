Hydrodynamical (or 3D) and non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE) effects are known to affect
abundance analyses. However, there are very few observational abundance testsof 3D and NLTE models.
We developed a new way of testing the abundance predictions of 3D and NLTE models, taking advantage
of large spectroscopic survey data. We use a line-by-line analysis of the Apache Point Observatory
Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) spectra (H band) with the Brussels Automatic Code for Characterizing
High accUracy Spectra (BACCHUS). We compute line-by-line abundances of Mg, Si, Ca, and Fe for a large
number of globular cluster K giants in the APOGEE survey. We compare this line-by-line analysis
against NLTE and 3D predictions. While the 1D-NLTE models provide corrections in the right direction,
there are quantitative discrepancies between different models. We observe a better agreement
with the data for the models including reliable collisional cross-sections. The agreement between
data and models is not always satisfactory when the 3D spectra are computed in LTE. However, we note
that for a fair comparison, 3D corrections should be computed with self-consistently derived stellar
parameters, and not on 1D models with identical stellar parameters. Finally, we focus on 3D and NLTE
effects on Fe lines in the H band, where we observe a systematic difference in abundance relative
to the value from the optical. Our results suggest that the metallicities obtained from the H band
are more accurate in metal-poor giants. More atomic data and extended self-consistent 3D-NLTE
computations need to be made. The method we have developed for testing 3D and NLTE models could be
extended to other lines and elements, and is particularly suited for large spectroscopic surveys.

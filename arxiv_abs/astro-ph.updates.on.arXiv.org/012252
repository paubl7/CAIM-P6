Despite evidence for the existence of dark matter (DM) from very high and low redshifts, a moderate
amount of DM particle decay remains a valid possibility. This includes both models with very long-lived
yet unstable particles or mixed scenarios where only a small fraction of dark matter is allowed to
decay. In this paper, we investigate how DM particles decaying into radiation affect non-linear
structure formation. We look at the power spectrum and its redshift evolution, varying both the
decay lifetime ($\tau$) and the fraction of decaying-to-total dark matter ($f$), and we propose
a fitting function that reaches sub-percent precision below $k\sim10$ h/Mpc. Based on this fit,
we perform a forecast analysis for a Euclid-like weak lensing (WL) survey, including both massive
neutrino and baryonic feedback parameters. We find that with WL observations alone, it is possible
to rule out decay lifetimes smaller than $\tau=75$ Gyr (at 95 percent CL) for the case that all DM is
unstable. This constraint improves to $\tau=182$ Gyr if the WL data is combined with CMB priors from
the Planck satellite and to $\tau=275$ Gyr if we further assume baryonic feedback to be fully constrained
by upcoming Sunyaev-Zeldovich or X-ray data. The latter shows a factor of 3.2 improvement compared
to constraints from CMB data alone. Regarding the scenario of a strongly decaying sub-component
of dark matter with $\tau\sim 30$ Gyr or lower, it will be possible to rule out a decaying-to-total
fraction of $f>0.49$, $f>0.21$, and $f>0.13$ (at the 95 percent CL) for the same three scenarios.
We conclude that the upcoming stage-IV WL surveys will allow us to significantly improve current
constraints on the stability of the dark matter sector.

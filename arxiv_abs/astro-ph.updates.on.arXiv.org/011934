We present high-precision photometry and polarimetry for the protoplanetary disk around HD142527,
with a focus on determining the light scattering parameters of the dust. We re-reduced polarimetric
differential imaging data of HD142527 in the VBB (735 nm) and H-band (1625 nm) from the ZIMPOL and
IRDIS subinstruments of SPHERE/VLT. With polarimetry and photometry based on reference star differential
imaging, we were able to measure the linearly polarized intensity and the total intensity of the
light scattered by the circumstellar disk with high precision. We used simple Monte Carlo simulations
of multiple light scattering by the disk surface to derive constraints for three scattering parameters
of the dust: the maximum polarization of $P_{\rm max}$, the asymmetry parameter $g$, and the single-scattering
albedo $\omega$. We measure a reflected total intensity of $51.4\pm1.5$ mJy and $206\pm12$ mJy
and a polarized intensity of $11.3\pm0.3$ mJy and $55.1\pm3.3$ mJy in the VBB and H-band, respectively.
We also find in the visual range a degree of polarization that varies between $28\%$ on the far side
of the disk and $17\%$ on the near side. The disk shows a red color for the scattered light intensity
and the polarized intensity, which are about twice as high in the near-infrared when compared to
the visual. We determine with model calculations the scattering properties of the dust particles
and find evidence for strong forward scattering ($g\approx 0.5-0.75$), relatively low single-scattering
albedo ($\omega \approx 0.2-0.5$), and high maximum polarization ($P_{\rm max} \approx 0.5-0.75$)
at the surface on the far side of the disk for both observed wavelengths. The optical parameters indicate
the presence of large aggregate dust particles, which are necessary to explain the high maximum
polarization, the strong forward-scattering nature of the dust, and the observed red disk color.

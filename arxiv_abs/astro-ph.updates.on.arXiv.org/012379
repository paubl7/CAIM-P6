Multiple populations in globular clusters are usually explained by the formation of stars out of
material with a chemical composition that is polluted to different degrees by the ejecta of short-lived,
massive stars of various type. Among other things, these polluters differ by the amount of helium
they spread in the surrounding medium. In this study we investigate whether the present-day photometric
method used to infer the helium content of multiple populations indeed gives the true value or underestimates
it by missing very He-rich, but rare stars. We focus on the specific case of NGC6752. We compute atmosphere
models and synthetic spectra along isochrones produced for this cluster for a very broad range of
He abundances covering the predictions of different pollution scenarios, including the extreme
case of the fast-rotating massive star (FRMS) scenario. We calculate synthetic photometry in HST
filters best suited to study the helium content. We subsequently build synthetic clusters with
various distributions of stars. We finally determine the maximum helium mass fraction of these
synthetic clusters using a method similar to that applied to observational data. We build toy models
of clusters with various distributions of multiple populations and ensure that we are able to recover
the input maximum Y. We then build synthetic clusters with the populations predicted by the FRMS
scenario and find that while we slightly underestimate the maximum Y value, we are still able to detect
stars much more He-rich than the current observed maximum Y. It is easier to determine the maximum
Y on main sequence stars than on red giant branch stars, but qualitatively the results are unaffected
by the sample choice. We show that in NGC6752 it is unlikely that stars more He-rich than the current
observational limit of about 0.3 are present.

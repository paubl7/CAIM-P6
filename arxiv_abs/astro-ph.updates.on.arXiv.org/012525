The recent launch of Solar Orbiter and BepiColombo opened a brief window in which these two spacecraft
were positioned in a constellation that allows for the detailed sampling of any Earth-directed
CMEs. Fortunately, two such events occurred with in situ detections of an ICME by Solar Orbiter on
the 19th of April and the 28th of May 2020. These two events were subsequently also observed in situ
by BepiColombo and Wind around a day later. We attempt to reconstruct the observed in situ magnetic
field measurements for all three spacecraft simultaneously using an empirical magnetic flux rope
model. This allows us to test the validity of our flux rope model on a larger and more global scale and
allows for cross-validation of the analysis with different spacecraft combinations. Finally,
we can also compare the results from the in situ modeling to remote observations obtained from the
STEREO-A heliospheric imagers. We make use of the 3D coronal rope ejection model in order to simulate
the ICME evolution. We adapt a previously developed ABC-SMC fitting algorithm for the application
to multi point scenarios. We show that we are able to generally reconstruct the flux ropes signatures
at three different spacecraft positions simultaneously using our model in combination with the
flux rope fitting algorithm. For the well-behaved 19th of April ICME our approach works very well.
The 28th of May ICME, on the other hand, shows the limitations of our approach. Unfortunately, the
usage of multi-point observations for these events does not appear to solve inherent issues, such
as the estimation of the magnetic field twist or flux rope aspect-ratios due to the specific constellation
of the spacecraft positions. As our general approach can be used for any fast forward simulation-based
model we give a blueprint for future studies using more advanced ICME models.

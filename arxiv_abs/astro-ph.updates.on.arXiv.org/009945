The aim of this work is to bridge the gap between CC SNe and their remnants by investigating how post-explosion
anisotropies in the ejecta influence the structure and chemical properties of the remnant at later
times. We performed three-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical simulations starting soon after
the SN event and following the evolution of the system in the circumstellar medium (consisting of
the wind of the stellar progenitor), for 5000 years, obtaining the physical scenario of a SNR. Here
we focused the analysis on the case of a progenitor red supergiant of 19.8 M_sun. We also investigated
how a post-explosion large-scale anisotropy in the SN affects the ejecta distribution and the matter
mixing of heavy elements in the remnant, during the first 5000 years of evolution. In the case of a
spherically symmetric SN explosion without large-scale anisotropies, the remnant roughly keeps
memory of the original onion-like layering of ejecta soon after the SN event. Nevertheless, as the
reverse shock hits the ejecta, the element distribution departs from a homologous expansion, because
of the slowing down of the outermost ejecta layers due to interaction with the reverse shock. In the
case of a large-scale anisotropy developed after the SN, we found that the chemical stratification
in the ejecta can be strongly modified and the original onion-like layering is not preserved. The
anisotropy may cause spatial inversion of ejecta layers, for instance leading to Fe/Si-rich ejecta
outside the O shell, and may determine the formation of Fe/Si-rich jet-like features that may protrude
the remnant outline. The level of matter mixing and the properties of the jet-like feature are sensitive
to the initial physical (density and velocity) and geometrical (size and position) initial characteristics
of the anisotropy.

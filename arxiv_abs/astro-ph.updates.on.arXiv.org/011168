Context. QSO B1420+326 is a blazar classified as a Flat Spectrum Radio Quasar (FSRQ). In the beginning
of 2020 it underwent an enhanced flux state. An extensive multiwavelength campaign allowed us to
trace the evolution of the flare. Aims. We search for VHE gamma-ray emission from QSO B1420+326 during
this flaring state. We aim to characterize and model the broadband emission of the source over different
phases of the flare. Methods. The source was observed with a number of instruments in radio, near
infrared, optical (including polarimetry and spectroscopy), ultra-violet, X-ray and gamma-ray
bands. We use dedicated optical spectroscopy results to estimate the accretion disk and the dust
torus luminosity. We perform spectral energy distribution modeling in the framework of combined
Synchrotron-Self-Compton and External Compton scenario in which the electron energy distribution
is partially determined from acceleration and cooling processes. Results. During the enhanced
state the flux of both SED components drastically increased and the peaks were shifted to higher
energies. Follow up observations with the MAGIC telescopes led to the detection of very-high-energy
gamma-ray emission from this source, making it one of only a handful of FSRQs known in this energy
range. Modeling allows us to constrain the evolution of the magnetic field and electron energy distribution
in the emission region. The gamma-ray flare was accompanied by a rotation of the optical polarization
vector during a low polarization state. Also, a new, superluminal radio knot contemporaneously
appeared in the radio image of the jet. The optical spectroscopy shows a prominent FeII bump with
flux evolving together with the continuum emission and a MgII line with varying equivalent width.

(Abridged) Modern studies and industrial applications related to the design, radiation protection,
and reliability of nuclear facilities, medical applications, as well as space research and exploration
are relying on extensive simulations and modeling. Computer codes realizing semi-classical and
quantum molecular dynamics (QMD) approaches are often employed to make up for the lack of accelerator
data on many nuclear reactions at intermediate and high energies (>10s of MeV/n) and are in high demand.
This contribution focuses on the methodology of generating reliable proton-induced cross sections
in the energy range below 1 GeV. We developed a problem-oriented computer framework based on MCNPX
and CASCADE/INPE codes to calculate activation cross section data at intermediate and high energies.
Goodness of the fits of nucleon-nucleus interaction models to the existing data is evaluated based
on elaborated algorithms. The method is based on the analysis of a large set of data and calculated
cross sections for different targets and residual nuclei in a wide range of proton energies using
numerous criteria. In practice, this could be done by tuning the model parameters and algorithms
to fit required experimental data subset, or through achieving unification and consistency of
fundamental parameters for all considered reactions. The presented framework is pursuing the
latter approach. We use proton-induced reactions on Si and Fe nuclei to illustrate the application
of the developed multi-criteria algorithm, where we use all data below 1 GeV available from the EXFOR
data library and the IAEA CRP "Benchmark of Spallation Models." We show that the analysis of the predictive
power of various intermediate and high-energy models based on the multi-criteria algorithm allows
more sophisticated selection of appropriate models in a given energy range and residual nuclei
domain.

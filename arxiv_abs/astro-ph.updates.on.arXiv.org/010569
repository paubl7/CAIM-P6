There is no list of bipolar active regions (ARs) with reverse polarity (anti-Hale regions), although
statistical investigations of such ARs (bearing the imprint of deep subphotospheric processes)
are important for understanding solar-cycle mechanisms. We studied 8606 ARs from 1 January 1989
to 31 December 2018 to detect anti-Hale regions and to compile a catalog. The Solar and Heliospheric
Observatory (SOHO) and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) data, as well as the Debrecen Photoheliographic
Data, the Mount Wilson Observatory catalog and drawings, and the USAF/NOAA Solar Region Summary
were used. Complex, ambiguous cases related to anti-Hale region identification were analyzed.
Two basic and four additional criteria to identify an AR as an anti-Hale region were formulated.
The basic criteria assume that: i) dominating features of an AR have to form a bipole of reverse polarity
with sunspots/pores of both polarities being present; ii) magnetic connections between the opposite
polarities has to be observed. A catalog of anti-Hale regions (275 ARs) is compiled. The catalog
contains: NOAA number, date of the greatest total area of sunspots, coordinates, and corrected
sunspot area for this date. The tilt and the most complex achieved Mount Wilson magnetic class are
also provided. The percentage of anti-Hale groups meeting the proposed criteria is ~3.0% from all
studied ARs, which is close to early estimations by authors who had examined each AR individually:
~2.4% by Hale and Nicholson (Ap.J. 62, 270, 1925) and ~3.1% by Richardson (Ap.J. 107, 78, 1948). The
enchancement of the anti-Hale percentage in later research might be related to: i) increasing sensitivity
of instruments (considering smaller and smaller bipoles); ii) the ambiguities in the anti-Hale
region identification.

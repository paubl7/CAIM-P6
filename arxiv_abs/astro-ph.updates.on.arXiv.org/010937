It is widely known that giant planets have the capacity to open deep gaps in their natal gaseous protoplanetary
discs. It is unclear, however, how gas accretion onto growing planets influences the shape and depth
of their growing gaps. We performed isothermal hydrodynamical simulations with the Fargo-2D1D
code, which assumes planets accreting gas within full discs that range from 0.1 to 260 AU. The gas
accretion routine uses a sink cell approach, in which different accretion rates are used to cope
with the broad range of gas accretion rates cited in the literature. We find that the planetary gas
accretion rate increases for larger disc aspect ratios and greater viscosities. Our main results
show that gas accretion has an important impact on the gap-opening mass: we find that when the disc
responds slowly to a change in planetary mass (i.e., at low viscosity), the gap-opening mass scales
with the planetary accretion rate, with a higher gas accretion rate resulting in a larger gap-opening
mass. On the other hand, if the disc response time is short (i.e., at high viscosity), then gas accretion
helps the planet carve a deep gap. As a consequence, higher planetary gas accretion rates result
in smaller gap-opening masses. Our results have important implications for the derivation of planet
masses from disc observations: depending on the planetary gas accretion rate, the derived masses
from ALMA observations might be off by up to a factor of two. We discuss the consequences of the change
in the gap-opening mass on the evolution of planetary systems based on the example of the grand tack
scenario. Planetary gas accretion also impacts stellar gas accretion, where the influence is minimal
due to the presence of a gas-accreting planet.

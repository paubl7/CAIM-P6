We study the metallicity dependence of the H/H$_2$ and C$^+$/C/CO distributions in a self-regulated
interstellar medium (ISM) across a broad range of metallicities ($0.1 < Z/Z_\odot < 3$). To this
end, we conduct high-resolution (particle mass of $1\ {\rm M_\odot}$) hydrodynamical simulations
coupled with a time-dependent H$_2$ chemistry network. The results are then post-processed with
an accurate chemistry network to model the associated C$^+$/C/CO abundances, based on the time-dependent
non-steady-state (``non-equilibrium'') H$_2$ abundances. We find that the time-averaged star
formation rate and the ISM structure are insensitive to metallicity. The column densities relevant
for molecular shielding appear correlated with the volume densities in gravitationally unstable
gas. As metallicity decreases, H$_2$ progressively deviates from steady state (``equilibrium'')
and shows shallow abundance profiles until they sharply truncate at the photodissociation fronts.
In contrast, the CO profile is sharp and controlled by photodissociation as CO quickly reaches steady
state. We construct effective one-dimensional cloud models that successfully capture the time-averaged
chemical distributions in simulations. At low metallicities, the steady-state model significantly
overestimates the abundance of H$_2$ in the diffuse medium. The overestimated H$_2$, however,
has little impact on CO. Consequently, the mass fraction of CO-dark H$_2$ gas is significantly lower
than what a fully steady-state model predicts. The mass ratios of H$_2$/C$^+$ and H$_2$/C both show
a weaker dependence on $Z^{\prime}$ than H$_2$/CO, which potentially indicates that C$^+$ and
C could be alternative tracers for H$_2$ at low $Z^{\prime}$ in terms of mass budget. Our chemistry
code for post-processing is publicly available.

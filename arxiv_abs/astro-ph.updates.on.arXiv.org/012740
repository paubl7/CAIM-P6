Solar wind plasma at the Earth's orbit carries transient magnetic field structures including discontinuities.
Their interaction with the Earth's bow shock can significantly alter discontinuity configuration
and stability. We investigate such an interaction for the most widespread type of solar wind discontinuities
- rotational discontinuities (RDs). We use a set of in situ multispacecraft observations and perform
kinetic hybrid simulations. We focus on the RD current density amplification that may lead to magnetic
reconnection. We show that the amplification can be as high as two orders of magnitude and is mainly
governed by three processes: the transverse magnetic field compression, global thinning of RD,
and interaction of RD with low-frequency electromagnetic waves in the magnetosheath, downstream
of the bow shock. The first factor is found to substantially exceed simple hydrodynamic predictions
in most observed cases, the second effect has a rather moderate impact, while the third causes strong
oscillations of the current density. We show that the presence of accelerated particles in the bow
shock precursor highly boosts the current density amplification, making the postshock magnetic
reconnection more probable. The pool of accelerated particles strongly affects the interaction
of RDs with the Earth's bow shock, as it is demonstrated by observational data analysis and hybrid
code simulations. Thus, shocks should be distinguished not by the inclination angle, but rather
by the presence of foreshocks populated with shock reflected particles. Plasma processes in the
RD-shock interaction affect magnetic structures and turbulence in the Earth's magnetosphere
and may have implications for the processes in astrophysics.

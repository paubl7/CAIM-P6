We perform a consistent comparison of the mass and mass profiles of massive ($M_\star > 10^{11.4}M_{\odot}$)
central galaxies at z~0.4 from deep Hyper Suprime-Cam (HSC) observations and from the Illustris,
TNG100, and Ponos simulations. Weak lensing measurements from HSC enable measurements at fixed
halo mass and provide constraints on the strength and impact of feedback at different halo mass scales.
We compare the stellar mass function (SMF) and the Stellar-to-Halo Mass Relation (SHMR) at various
radii and show that the radius at which the comparison is performed is important. In general, Illustris
and TNG100 display steeper values of $\alpha$ where $M_{\star}\propto M_{\rm vir}^{\alpha}$.
These differences are more pronounced for Illustris than for TNG100 and in the inner rather than
outer regions of galaxies. Differences in the inner regions may suggest that TNG100 is too efficient
at quenching in-situ star formation at $M_{\rm vir}\simeq10^{13} M_{\odot}$ but not efficient
enough at $M_{\rm vir}\simeq10^{14} M_{\odot}$. The outer stellar masses are in excellent agreement
with our observations at $M_{\rm vir}\simeq10^{13} M_{\odot}$, but both Illustris and TNG100
display excess outer mass as $M_{\rm vir}\simeq10^{14} M_{\odot}$ (by ~0.25 and ~0.12 dex, respectively).
We argue that reducing stellar growth at early times in $M_\star \sim 10^{9-10} M_{\odot}$ galaxies
would help to prevent excess ex-situ growth at this mass scale. The Ponos simulations do not implement
AGN feedback and display an excess mass of ~0.5 dex at $r<30$ kpc compared to HSC which is indicative
of over-cooling and excess star formation in the central regions. Joint comparisons between weak
lensing and galaxy stellar profiles are a direct test of whether simulations build and deposit galaxy
mass in the correct dark matter halos and thereby provide powerful constraints on the physics of
feedback and galaxy growth.

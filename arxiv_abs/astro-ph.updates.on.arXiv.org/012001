The Fermi Large Area Telescope has revolutionised the $\gamma$-ray pulsar field, increasing the
population to over 250 detected pulsars. The majority display spectra with exponential cutoffs
in a narrow range around a few GeV. Models predicted cutoffs up to 100 GeV; it was therefore not expected
that pulsars would be visible in the very-high-energy ($>$100 GeV) regime. Subsequent surprise
discoveries by ground-based telescopes of pulsed emission from four pulsars above tens of GeV have
marked the beginning of a new era, raising important questions about the electrodynamics and local
environment of pulsar magnetospheres. Detection of the Vela pulsar by H.E.S.S. (20-120 GeV) and
Fermi provides evidence for a curved spectrum. We posit this to result from curvature radiation
via primary particles in the pulsar magnetosphere and current sheet. We present energy-dependent
light curves using an extended slot gap and current sheet model and invoking a two-step accelerating
$E$-field as motivated by kinetic simulations. I include a refined calculation of the curvature
radius of particle trajectories, impacting the particle transport, predicted light curves, and
spectra. The model reproduces the decrease of flux of the first light-curve peak relative to the
second one, evolution of the bridge emission, near constant phase positions of peaks, and narrowing
of pulses with increasing energy. We can fundamentally explain the first of these trends, since
I found that the curvature radii of the particle trajectories in regions where the second $\gamma$-ray
light curve peak originates are systematically larger than those associated with the first peak,
implying a correspondingly larger cutoff for the second peak. An unknown azimuthal dependence
of the $E$-field as well as uncertainty in the precise emission locale preclude a simplistic discrimination
of emission mechanisms.

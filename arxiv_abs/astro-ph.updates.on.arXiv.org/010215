We present a survey of MgII absorbing gas in the vicinity of 380 random galaxies, using 156 background
quasi-stellar objects(QSOs) as absorption-line probes. The sample comprises 211 isolated (73
quiescent and 138 star-forming galaxies) and 43 non-isolated galaxies with sensitive constraints
for both MgII absorption and Ha emission. The projected distances span a range from d=9 to 497 kpc,
redshifts of the galaxies range from z=0.10 to 0.48, and rest-frame absolute B-band magnitudes
range from $M_{\rm B}=-16.7$ to $-22.8$. Our analysis shows that the rest-frame equivalent width
of MgII, $W_r$(2796), depends on halo radius($R_h$), $B$-band luminosity($L_{\rm B}$) and stellar
mass ($M_{\rm star}$) of the host galaxies, and declines steeply with increasing $d$ for isolated,
star-forming galaxies. $W_r$(2796) exhibits no clear trend for either isolated, quiescent galaxies
or non-isolated galaxies. The covering fraction of MgII absorbing gas $\langle \kappa \rangle$
is high with $\langle \kappa \rangle\gtrsim 60$% at $<40$ kpc for isolated galaxies and declines
rapidly to $\langle \kappa \rangle\approx 0$ at $d\gtrsim100$ kpc. Within the gaseous radius,
$\langle \kappa \rangle$ depends sensitively on both $M_{\rm star}$ and the specific star formation
rate inferred from Ha. Different from massive quiescent halos, the observed velocity dispersion
of MgII gas around star-forming galaxies is consistent with expectations from virial motion, which
constrains individual clump mass to $m_{\rm cl} \gtrsim 10^5 \,\rm M_\odot$ and cool gas accretion
rate of $\sim 0.7-2 \,M_\odot\,\rm yr^{-1}$. We find no strong azimuthal dependence of MgII absorption
for either star-forming or quiescent galaxies. Our results highlight the need of a homogeneous,
absorption-blind sample for establishing a holistic description of chemically-enriched gas
in the circumgalactic space.

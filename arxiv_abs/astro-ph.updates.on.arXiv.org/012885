Context: After the successful launch of the Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) mission in July 2019,
eROSITA, the soft X-ray instrument aboard SRG, performed scanning observations of a large contiguous
field, namely the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS), ahead of the planned four-year
all-sky survey. eFEDS yielded a large sample of X-ray sources with very rich multi-band photometric
and spectroscopic coverage. Aims: We present here the eFEDS Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) catalog
and the eROSITA X-ray spectral properties of the eFEDS sources. Methods: Using a Bayesian method,
we perform a systematic X-ray spectral analysis for all eFEDS sources. The appropriate model is
chosen based on the source classification and the spectral quality, and, in the case of AGN, including
the possibility of intrinsic (rest-frame) absorption and/or soft excess emission. Hierarchical
Bayesian modeling (HBM) is used to estimate the spectral parameter distribution of the sample.
Results: X-ray spectral properties are presented for all eFEDS X-ray sources. There are 21952 candidate
AGN, which comprise 79% of the eFEDS sample. Despite a large number of faint sources with low photon
counts, our spectral fitting provides meaningful measurements of fluxes, luminosities, and spectral
shapes for a majority of the sources. This AGN catalog is dominated by X-ray unobscured sources,
with an obscured (logNH>21.5) fraction of 10% derived by HBM. The power-law slope of the catalog
can be described by a Gaussian distribution of 1.94+-0.22. Above a photon counts threshold of 500,
nine out of 50 AGN have soft excess detected. For the sources with blue UV to optical color (type-I
AGN), the X-ray emission is well correlated with the UV emission with the usual anti-correlation
between the X-ray to UV spectral slope {\alpha}_{OX} and the UV luminosity.

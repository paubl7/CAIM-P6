With the recent advent of circular polarization capabilities at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA), Zeeman effect measurements of spectral lines are now possible as a means to directly
probe line-of-sight magnetic fields in protoplanetary disks (PPDs). We present a modeling study
that aims to guide physical interpretation of these anticipated observations. Using a fiducial
density structure based on a typical ringed disk, we simulate line emission for the hyperfine components
of the CN $J = 1-0$ transition with the POLARIS radiative transfer code. Since the expected magnetic
field and typical CN distribution in PPDs remain largely unconstrained, we produce models with
several different configurations. Corresponding integrated Stokes $I$ and $V$ profiles and 0.4
km/s resolution, 1'' beam convolved channel maps are presented. We demonstrate that the emission
signatures from toroidally dominated magnetic fields are distinguishable from vertically dominated
magnetic field based on channel map morphology. Due to line-of-sight and beam cancellation effects,
disks with toroidal $\boldsymbol{B}$-field configurations result in significantly diminished
Stokes $V$ emission. Complex magnetic fields therefore render the traditionally used method for
inferring line-of-sight magnetic field strengths (i.e., fitting the derivative of the Stokes
$I$ to the Stokes $V$ profile) ambiguous, since a given intrinsic field strength can yield a variety
of Stokes $V$ amplitudes depending on the magnetic field geometry. In addition, gas gaps can create
structure in the integrated Stokes $V$ profile that might mimic magnetic substructure. This method
should therefore be applied with caution in PPD environments, and can only confidently be used as
a measure of magnetic field strength if the disk's magnetic field configuration is well understood.

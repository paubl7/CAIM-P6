Class II methanol masers are signs of massive young stellar objects (MYSOs). Recent findings show
that MYSO accretion bursts cause flares of these masers. Thus, maser monitoring can be used to identify
such bursts. Burst-induced SED changes provide valuable information on a very intense phase of
high-mass star formation. In mid-January 2019, a maser flare of the MYSO G358.93-0.03 was reported.
ALMA and SMA imaging resolved the core of the star forming region and proved the association of the
masers with the brightest continuum source MM1. However, no significant flux rise of the (sub)mm
dust continuum was found. Thus, we performed NIR imaging with GROND and IFU spectroscopy with FIFI-LS
aboard SOFIA to detect possible counterparts to the (sub)mm sources, and compare their photometry
to archival measurements. The comparison of pre-burst and burst SEDs is of crucial importance to
judge whether a luminosity increase due to the burst is present and if it triggered the maser flare.
The FIR fluxes of MM1 measured with FIFI-LS exceed those from Herschel significantly, which clearly
confirms the presence of an accretion burst. The second epoch data, taken about 16 months later,
still show increased fluxes. Our RT modeling yielded major burst parameters and suggests that the
MYSO features a circumstellar disk which might be transient. From the multi-epoch SEDs, conclusions
on heating and cooling time-scales could be drawn. Circumstances of the burst-induced maser relocation
have been explored. The verification of the accretion burst from G358 is another confirmation that
Class II methanol maser flares represent an alert for such events. The few events known to date already
indicate that there is a broad range in burst strength and duration as well as environmental characteristics.
The G358 event is the shortest and least luminous MYSO accretion burst so far.

The flat spectrum radio quasar (FSRQ) PKS 1510-089 is known for its complex multiwavelength behavior,
and is one of only a few FSRQs detected at very high energy (VHE, $E>100\,$GeV) $\gamma$-rays. VHE
$\gamma$-ray observations with H.E.S.S. and MAGIC during late May and early June 2016 resulted
in the detection of an unprecedented flare, which reveals for the first time VHE $\gamma$-ray intranight
variability in this source. While a common variability timescale of $1.5\,$hr is found, there is
a significant deviation near the end of the flare with a timescale of $\sim 20\,$min marking the cessation
of the event. The peak flux is nearly two orders of magnitude above the low-level emission. For the
first time, curvature is detected in the VHE $\gamma$-ray spectrum of PKS 1510-089, which is fully
explained through absorption by the extragalactic background light. Optical R-band observations
with ATOM reveal a counterpart of the $\gamma$-ray flare, even though the detailed flux evolution
differs from the VHE ightcurve. Interestingly, a steep flux decrease is observed at the same time
as the cessation of the VHE flare. In the high energy (HE, $E>100\,$MeV) $\gamma$-ray band only a
moderate flux increase is observed with Fermi-LAT, while the HE $\gamma$-ray spectrum significantly
hardens up to a photon index of 1.6. A search for broad-line region (BLR) absorption features in the
$\gamma$-ray spectrum indicates that the emission region is located outside of the BLR. Radio VLBI
observations reveal a fast moving knot interacting with a standing jet feature around the time of
the flare. As the standing feature is located $\sim 50\,$pc from the black hole, the emission region
of the flare may have been located at a significant distance from the black hole. If this correlation
is indeed true, VHE $\gamma$ rays have been produced far down the jet where turbulent plasma crosses
a standing shock.

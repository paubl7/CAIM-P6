Black-hole (BH) accretion disks formed in compact-object mergers or collapsars may be major sites
of the rapid-neutron-capture (r-)process, but the conditions determining the electron fraction
(Y_e) remain uncertain given the complexity of neutrino transfer and angular-momentum transport.
After discussing relevant weak-interaction regimes, we study the role of neutrino absorption
for shaping Y_e using an extensive set of simulations performed with two-moment neutrino transport
and again without neutrino absorption. We vary the torus mass, BH mass and spin, and examine the impact
of rest-mass and weak-magnetism corrections in the neutrino rates. We also test the dependence
on the angular-momentum transport treatment by comparing axisymmetric models using the standard
alpha-viscosity with viscous models assuming constant viscous length scales (l_t) and three-dimensional
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations. Finally, we discuss the nucleosynthesis yields and basic
kilonova properties. We find that absorption pushes Y_e towards ~0.5 outside the torus, while inside
increasing the equilibrium value Y_e^eq by ~0.05--0.2. Correspondingly, a substantial ejecta
fraction is pushed above Y_e=0.25, leading to a reduced lanthanide fraction and a brighter, earlier,
and bluer kilonova than without absorption. More compact tori with higher neutrino optical depth,
tau, tend to have lower Y_e^eq up to tau~1-10, above which absorption becomes strong enough to reverse
this trend. Disk ejecta are less (more) neutron-rich when employing an l_t=const. viscosity (MHD
treatment). The solar-like abundance pattern found for our MHD model marginally supports collapsar
disks as major r-process sites, although a strong r-process may be limited to phases of high mass-infall
rates, Mdot>~ 2 x 10^(-2) Msun/s.

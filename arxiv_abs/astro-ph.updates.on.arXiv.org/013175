The Global Meteor Network (GMN) utilizes highly sensitive low-cost CMOS video cameras which run
open-source meteor detection software on Raspberry Pi computers. Currently, over 450 GMN cameras
in 30 countries are deployed. The main goal of the network is to provide long-term characterization
of the radiants, flux, and size distribution of annual meteor showers and outbursts in the optical
meteor mass range. The rapid 24-hour publication cycle the orbital data will enhance the public
situational awareness of the near-Earth meteoroid environment. The GMN also aims to increase the
number of instrumentally observed meteorite falls and the transparency of data reduction methods.
A novel astrometry calibration method is presented which allows decoupling of the camera pointing
from the distortion, and is used for frequent pointing calibrations through the night. Using wide-field
cameras ($88^{\circ}\times48^{\circ}$) with a limiting stellar magnitude of $+6.0 \pm 0.5$ at
25 frames per second, over 220,000 precise meteoroid orbits were collected since December 2018
until June 2021. The median radiant precision of all computed trajectories is $0.47^{\circ}$,
$0.32^{\circ}$ for $\sim20\%$ of meteors which were observed from 4+ stations, a precision sufficient
to measure physical dispersions of meteor showers. All non-daytime annual established meteor
showers were observed during that time, including five outbursts. An analysis of a meteorite-dropping
fireball is presented which showed visible wake, fragmentation details, and several discernible
fragments. It had spatial trajectory fit errors of only ~40 m, which translated into the estimated
radiant and velocity errors of 3 arc minutes and tens of meters per second.

We present ${\tt nimbus}$ : a hierarchical Bayesian framework to infer the intrinsic luminosity
parameters of kilonovae (KNe) associated with gravitational-wave (GW) events, based purely on
non-detections. This framework makes use of GW 3-D distance information and electromagnetic upper
limits from a given survey for multiple events, and self-consistently accounts for finite sky-coverage
and probability of astrophysical origin. The framework is agnostic to the brightness evolution
assumed and can account for multiple electromagnetic passbands simultaneously. Our analyses
highlight the importance of accounting for model selection effects, especially in the context
of non-detections. We show our methodology using a simple, two-parameter linear brightness model,
taking the follow-up of GW190425 with the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) as a single-event test
case for two different prior choices of model parameters -- (i) uniform/uninformative priors and
(ii) astrophysical priors based on surrogate models of Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations
of KNe. We present results under the assumption that the KN is within the searched region to demonstrate
functionality and the importance of prior choice. Our results show consistency with ${\tt simsurvey}$
-- an astronomical survey simulation tool used previously in the literature to constrain the population
of KNe. While our results based on uniform priors strongly constrain the parameter space, those
based on astrophysical priors are largely uninformative, highlighting the need for deeper constraints.
Future studies with multiple events having electromagnetic follow-up from multiple surveys should
make it possible to constrain the KN population further.

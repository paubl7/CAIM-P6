We use the SPace Infrared telescope for Cosmology and Astrophysics (SPICA) project as a template
to demonstrate how deep spectrophotometric surveys covering large cosmological volumes over
extended fields (1-15 square degrees) with a mid-IR imaging spectrometer (17-36 micron) in conjunction
with deep 70 micron photometry with a far-IR camera, at wavelengths which are not affected by dust
extinction can answer the most crucial questions in current galaxy evolution studies. A SPICA-like
mission will be able for the first time to provide an unobscured three dimensional (3-D, i.e. x, y
and redshift z) view of galaxy evolution back to an age of the Universe of less than ~2 Gyrs, in the mid-IR
rest-frame. This survey strategy will produce a full census of the Star formation Rate (SFR) in the
Universe, using Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) bands and fine-structure ionic lines,
reaching the characteristic knee of the galaxy luminosity function, where the bulk of the population
is distributed, at any redshift up to z ~3.5. Deep follow-up pointed spectroscopic observations
with grating spectrometers { onboard the satellite}, across the full IR spectral range (17-210
micron), would simultaneously measure Black Hole Accretion Rate (BHAR), from high-ionization
fine-structure lines, and SFR, from PAH and low- to mid-ionization lines in thousands of galaxies
from solar to low metallicities, down to the knee of their luminosity functions. The analysis of
the resulting atlas of IR spectra will reveal the physical processes at play in evolving galaxies
across cosmic time, especially its heavily dust-embedded phase during the activity peak at the
cosmic noon (z ~1-3), through IR emission lines and features that are insensitive to the dust obscuration.

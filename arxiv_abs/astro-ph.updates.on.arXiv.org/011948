We present new empirical constraints on the evolution of $\rho_{\rm H_2}$, the cosmological mass
density of molecular hydrogen, back to $z\approx2.5$. We employ a statistical approach measuring
the average observed $850\mu{\rm m}$ flux density of near-infrared selected galaxies as a function
of redshift. The redshift range considered corresponds to a span where the $850\mu{\rm m}$ band
probes the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of thermal dust emission in the rest-frame, and can therefore be
used as an estimate of the mass of the interstellar medium (ISM). Our sample comprises of ${\approx}150,000$
galaxies in the UKIDSS-UDS field with near-infrared magnitudes $K_{\rm AB}\leq25$ mag and photometric
redshifts with corresponding probability distribution functions derived from deep 12-band photometry.
With a sample approximately 2 orders of magnitude larger than in previous works we significantly
reduce statistical uncertainties on $\rho_{\rm H_2}$ to $z\approx2.5$. Our measurements are
in broad agreement with recent direct estimates from blank field molecular gas surveys, finding
that the epoch of molecular gas coincides with the peak epoch of star formation with $\rho_{\rm H_2}\approx2\times10^7\,{\rm
M_\odot}\,{\rm Mpc^{-3}}$ at $z\approx2$. We demonstrate that $\rho_{\rm H_2}$ can be broadly
modelled by inverting the star-formation rate density with a fixed or weakly evolving star-formation
efficiency. This 'constant efficiency' model shows a similar evolution to our statistically derived
$\rho_{\rm H_2}$, indicating that the dominant factor driving the peak star formation history
at $z\approx2$ is a larger supply of molecular gas in galaxies rather than a significant evolution
of the star-formation rate efficiency within individual galaxies.

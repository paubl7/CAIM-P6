We present new spectroscopic observations of Ly$\alpha$ Blob 2 (LAB2) in the SSA22 protocluster
region ($z \sim$ 3.1). By creating a narrow-band Ly$\alpha$ image, we observed extended Ly$\alpha$
emission in three distinct regions, in which the highest Ly$\alpha$ surface brightness (SB) center
is far away from the known continuum sources. We have searched through the MOSFIRE slits that cover
the high Ly$\alpha$ SB regions, but are unable to detect any significant nebular emission near the
highest SB center. We further map the blue-to-red flux ratio and find that it is anti-correlated
with Ly$\alpha$ SB with a power-law index of $\sim$ -0.4. To decode the spatially-resolved Ly$\alpha$
profiles using Monte-Carlo radiative transfer (MCRT) modelling, we use both multiphase, clumpy
models and shell models and successfully reproduced the diverse Ly$\alpha$ morphologies with
reasonable physical parameters. Significant correlations exist between parameters of two different
models, and our multiphase, clumpy model parameters naturally alleviated the previously reported
discrepancies between the shell model parameters and data. In addition, we have modeled Ly$\alpha$
spectra at different spatial positions simultaneously, and we find that the variation of the inferred
clump outflow velocity can be approximately explained by line-of-sight projection effects. Our
results support the `central powering + scattering' scenario, i.e. the Ly$\alpha$ photons are
generated by a central powering source and then scatter with outflowing, multiphase HI gas while
propagating outwards. The infalling of cool gas near the blob outskirts shapes the observed blue-dominated
Ly$\alpha$ profiles, but its energy contribution is likely to be minor compared to the photo-ionization
by star-forming galaxies and/or AGNs.

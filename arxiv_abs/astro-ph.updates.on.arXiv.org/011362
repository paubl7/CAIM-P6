By studying 7 objects in the Lupus clouds we aim to test if a coherence exists between commonly used
evolutionary tracers. We present ALMA observations of the continuum and molecular line emission
that probe the dense gas and dust of cores and their associated molecular outflows. Our source selection
in a common environment allows for a consistent comparison across different evolutionary stages.
The quality of the ALMA molecular data allows us to reveal the nature of the molecular outflows by
studying their morphology and kinematics. The images in IRAS15398-3359 appear to show that it drives
a precessing episodic jet-driven outflow with at least 4 ejections separated by periods of time
between 50 and 80 years, while data in IRAS16059-3857 show similarities with a wide-angle wind model
also showing signs of being episodic. The outflow of J160115-41523 could be better explain with
the wide-angle wind model as well, but new observations are needed to explore its nature. We find
that the most common evolutionary tracers are useful for broad evolutionary classifications,
but are not consistent with each other to provide enough granularity to disentangle different evolutionary
stage of sources that belong to the same Class. Outflow properties used as protostellar age tracers
(mass, momentum, energy, opening angle) may suffer from differences in the nature of each outflow,
thus detailed observations are needed to refine evolutionary classifications. We found both AzTEC-lup1-2
and AzTEC-lup3-5 to be in the pre-stellar stage, although the latter could be more evolved. IRAS15398-3359,
IRAS16059-3857 and J160115-41523, which have clearly detected outflows, are Class 0 sources,
although we are not able to determine which is younger and which is older. Sz102 and Merin28 are the
most evolved sources and show signs of having associated flows, not as well traced by CO as for the
younger sources.

Planetary cores are thought to form in proto-planetary disks via the growth of dusty solid material.
However, it is unclear how early this process begins. We study the physical structure and grain growth
in the edge-on disk that surrounds the ~1 Myr old low-mass (~0.55 Msun) protostar embedded in the
Bok Globule CB26 to examine how much grain growth has already occurred in the protostellar phase.
We combine the SED between 0.9 ${\mu}$m and 6.4 cm with high angular resolution continuum maps at
1.3, 2.9, and 8.1 mm, and use the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D to conduct a detailed modelling
of the dust emission from the disk and envelope of CB 26. We infer inner and outer disk radii of around
16 au and 172$\pm$22 au, respectively. The total gas mass in the disk is ~0.076 Msun, which amounts
to ~14% of the mass of the central star. The inner disk contains a compact free-free emission region,
which could be related to either a jet or a photoevaporation region. The thermal dust emission from
the outer disk is optically thin at mm wavelengths, while the emission from the inner disk midplane
is moderately optically thick. Our best-fit radiative transfer models indicate that the dust grains
in the disk have already grown to pebbles with diameters of the order of 10 cm in size. Residual 8.1
mm emission suggests the presence of even larger particles in the inner disk. For the optically thin
mm dust emission from the outer disk, we derive a mean opacity slope of 0.6$\pm$0.4, which is consistent
with the presence of large dust grains. The presence of cm-sized bodies in the CB 26 disk indicates
that solids grow rapidly already during the first million years in a protostellar disk. It is thus
possible that Class II disks are already seeded with large particles and may contain even planetesimals.

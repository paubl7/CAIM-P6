We present the census of massive (log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$)$\geq 11$) galaxies at $3<z<6$ identified
over the COSMOS/UltraVISTA Ultra-Deep field stripes: consisting of $\approx100$ and $\approx20$
high-confidence candidates at $3<z<4$ and $4<z<6$, respectively. The $3<z<4$ population is comprised
of post-starburst, UV star-forming and dusty-star forming galaxies in roughly equal fractions,
while UV-star-forming galaxies dominate at $4<z<6$ . We account for various sources of biases in
SED modelling, finding that the treatment of emission line contamination is essential for understanding
the number densities and mass growth histories of massive galaxies at $z>3$. The significant increase
in observed number densities at $z\sim4$ ($>\times$ 5 in $\lesssim600$ Myrs) implies that this
is the epoch at which log(M$_{*}$/M$_{\odot}$)$\geq 11$ galaxies emerge in significant numbers,
with stellar ages ($\approx500-900$ Myrs) indicating rapid formation epochs as early as $z\sim7$.
Leveraging ancillary multi-wavelength datasets, we perform panchromatic SED modelling to constrain
the total star-formation activity of the sample. The star-formation activity of the sample is generally
consistent with being on the star-formation main sequence at the considered redshifts, with $\approx15-25\%$
of the population showing evidence of suppressed star-formation rates, indicating that quenching
mechanisms are already at play by $z\sim4$. We stack available HST imaging, confirming their compact
nature ($r_{e}\lesssim2.2$ kpc), consistent with expected sizes of high-$z$ star-forming galaxies.
Finally, we discuss how our results are in-line with the early formation epochs and short formation
timescales inferred from the fossil records of the most massive galaxies in the Universe.

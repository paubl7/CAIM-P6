We present an HI 21cm absorption study of a sample of 26 radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) at
$0.25 < z < 0.4$ carried out with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. Our aim was to study the rate of
incidence of HI in various classes of radio AGN, the morphology and kinematics of the HI, and the nature
of the interaction between the HI and the radio source. Our sample consists of 14 extended sources
and 12 compact sources in the radio-power range 10$^{25.7}$W/Hz$~-~10^{26.5}$W/Hz. We detect
HI in 5 sources with a detection rate of $\sim$19%, similar to the detection rate at lower redshifts.
The rest-frame UV luminosities of most of the sources in the sample, including all the detections,
are below the proposed threshold above which the HI is supposed to have been ionised. The optical
emission-line spectra show that despite their high radio powers, one-third of the sample, including
two detections, are low-ionisation sources. The radio continuum emission from the HI detections
is unresolved at kpc scales, but is extended on parsec scales. The detections have complex HI 21cm
absorption profiles with FWZI ranging from 60 km/s to 700 km/s and exhibit remarkably high HI column
densities in the range 10$^{21}$ cm$^{-2}$ to 10$^{22}$ cm$^{-2}$ for T$_{\rm spin}=$100 K and
unit covering factor. A modelling of the HI 21cm absorption profiles suggests that in 2 sources the
gas is disturbed, and in 3 cases, including the one with disturbed HI, the majority of the absorption
is consistent with arising from an HI disc. Though we detect no fast HI outflows, the optical emission
lines in the HI detections show the presence of highly disturbed gas in the nuclear region. Since
some of our detections are low-ionisation AGN, this disturbance may be caused by the radio jets.
Overall, our findings point towards a continuation of the low-$z$ trends in the incidence of HI in
radio AGN up to $z \sim 0.4$.

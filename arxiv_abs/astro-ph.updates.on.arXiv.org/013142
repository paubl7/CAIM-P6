Galaxy mergers are thought to be one of the main mechanisms of the mass assembly of galaxies. Recently,
many works have suggested a possible increase in the fraction of major mergers in the early Universe,
reviving the debate on which processes (e.g., cold accretion, star formation, mergers) most contribute
to the mass build-up of galaxies through cosmic time. To estimate the importance of major mergers
in this context, we make use of the new data collected by the ALMA Large Program to INvestigate [CII]
at Early times (ALPINE), which observed the [CII] 158 $\mu$m emission line from a sample of 75 main-sequence
star-forming galaxies at 4.4 < z < 5.9. We used, for the first time, the morpho-kinematic information
provided by the [CII] emission to obtain the fraction of major mergers ($f_{MM}$) at z~5. By adopting
different prescriptions for the merger timescales ($T_{MM}$), we converted this fraction into
the merger rate per galaxy ($R_{MM}$) and per volume ($\Gamma_{MM}$). We then combined our results
with those at lower redshifts from the literature, computing the cosmic evolution of the merger
fraction. This is described by a rapid increase from z~0 to higher redshifts, a peak at z~3, and a slow
decrease towards earlier epochs. Depending on the timescale prescription used, this fraction
translates into a merger rate ranging between ~0.1 and ~4.0 Gyr$^{-1}$ at z~5. Finally, we compare
the specific star formation and star-formation rate density with the analogous quantities from
major mergers. Our new ALPINE data reveal the presence of a significant merging activity in the early
Universe. However, whether this population of mergers can provide a relevant contribution to the
galaxy mass assembly at these redshifts and through the cosmic epochs is strongly dependent on the
assumption of the merger timescale.

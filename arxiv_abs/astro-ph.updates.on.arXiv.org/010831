Many phenomena in the Sun's atmosphere are magnetic in nature and study of the atmospheric magnetic
field plays an important part in understanding these phenomena. Tools to study solar magnetic fields
include magnetic topology and features such as magnetic null points, separatrix surfaces, and
separators. The theory of these has most robustly been developed under magnetic charge topology,
where the sources of the magnetic field are taken to be discrete, but observed magnetic fields are
continuously distributed, and reconstructions and numerical simulations typically use continuously
distributed magnetic boundary conditions. This article investigates the pitfalls in using continuous
source descriptions, particularly when null points on the $z=0$ plane are obscured by the continuous
flux distribution through, e.g., the overlap of non-point sources. The idea of null-like points
on the boundary is introduced where the parallel requirement on the field $B_{\parallel}=0$ is
retained but the requirement on the perpendicular component is relaxed, i.e., $B_{\perp}\ne0$.
These allow the definition of separatrix-like surfaces which are shown (through use of a squashing
factor) to be a class of quasi-separatrix layer, and separator-like lines which retain the x-line
structure of separators. Examples are given that demonstrate that the use of null-like points can
reinstate topological features that are eliminated in the transition from discrete to continuous
sources, and that their inclusion in more involved cases can enhance understanding of the magnetic
structure and even change the resulting conclusions. While the examples in this article use the
potential approximation, the definition of null-like points is more general and may be employed
in other cases such as force-free field extrapolations and MHD simulations.

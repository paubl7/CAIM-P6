Microinstabilities play important roles in both entropy generation and particle acceleration
in collisionless shocks. Recent studies have suggested that in the transition zone of quasi-perpendicular
($Q_{\perp}$) shocks in the high-beta ($\beta=P_{\rm gas}/P_{\rm B}$) intracluster medium (ICM),
the ion temperature anisotropy due to the reflected-gyrating ions could trigger the Alfv\'en ion
cyclotron (AIC) instability and the ion-mirror instability, while the electron temperature anisotropy
induced by magnetic field compression could excite the whistler instability and the electron-mirror
instability. Adopting the numerical estimates for ion and electron temperature anisotropies
found in particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations of $Q_{\perp}$-shocks with sonic Mach numbers, $M_{\rm
s}=2-3$, we carry out a linear stability analysis for these microinstabilities. The kinetic properties
of the microinstabilities and the ensuing plasma waves on both ion and electron scales are described
for wide ranges of parameters, including the dependence on $\beta$ and the ion-to-electron mass
ratio. In addition, the nonlinear evolution of induced plasma waves are examined by performing
2D PIC simulations with periodic boundary conditions. We find that for $\beta\approx 20-100$,
the AIC instability could induce ion-scale waves and generate shock surface ripples in supercritical
shocks above the AIC critical Mach number, $M_{\rm AIC}^{*} \approx 2.3$. Also electron-scale
waves are generated primarily by the whistler instability in these high-$\beta$ shocks. The resulting
multi-scale waves from electron to ion scales are thought to be essential in electron injection
to the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism in $Q_{\perp}$-shocks in the ICM.

The dominant systematic uncertainty in the age determination of galactic globular clusters is
the depth of the convection envelope of the stars. This parameter is partially degenerate with metallicity
which is in turn degenerate with age. However, if the metal content, distance and extinction are
known, the position and morphology of the red giant branch in a color-magnitude diagram are mostly
sensitive to the value of the depth of the convective envelope. Therefore, using external, precise
metallicity determinations this degeneracy and thus the systematic error in age, can be reduced.
Alternatively, the morphology of the red giant branch of globular clusters color magnitude diagram
can also be used to achieve the same. We demonstrate that globular cluster red giant branches are
well fitted by values of the depth of the convection envelope consistent with those obtained for
the Sun and this finding is robust to the adopted treatment of the stellar physics. With these findings,
the uncertainty in the depth of the convection envelope is no longer the dominant contribution to
the systematic error in the age determination of the oldest globular clusters, reducing it from
$0.5$ to $0.23$ or $0.33$ Gyr, depending on the methodology adopted: i.e., whether resorting to
external data (spectroscopic metallicity determinations) or relying solely on the morphology
of the clusters's color-magnitude diagrams. This results in an age of the Universe $t_{\rm U}=13.5^{+0.16}_{-0.14}
{\rm (stat.)} \pm 0.23(0.33) ({\rm sys.})$ at 68\% confidence level, accounting for the formation
time of globular clusters and its uncertainty. An uncertainty of 0.27(0.36) Gyr if added in quadrature.
This agrees well with $13.8 \pm 0.02$ Gyr, the cosmological model-dependent value inferred by the
Planck mission assuming the $\Lambda$CDM model.

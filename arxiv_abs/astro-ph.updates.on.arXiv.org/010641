Theoretical investigations have provided proof-of-principle calculations suggesting measurements
of stellar or pulsar orbits near the Galactic Center could strongly constrain the properties of
the Galactic Center black hole, local matter, and even the theory of gravity itself. In this work,
we use both Markov chain Monte Carlo method and Fisher matrix to understand what parameters of the
stellar orbits and the black hole are well-constrained and why. Using both tools, we conclude that
existing astrometric measurements cannot constrain the spin of the Galactic Center black hole.
Extrapolating to the precision and cadence of future experiments, we anticipate that the black
hole spin can be measured with the known star S2. Our calculations show that we can measure the dimensionless
black hole spin to an accuracy and a precision of $\sim$0.1 with weekly measurements of the orbit
of S2 for 40 years using the GRAVITY telescope's best resolution at the Galactic Center. We derive
an analytic expression for the measurement uncertainty of the black hole spin using Fisher matrix
in terms of observation strategy, star's orbital parameters, and instrument resolution. We find
that highly eccentric orbit can provide better constraints on the spin, and an orbit with a higher
eccentricity is more favorable even when the orbital period is longer. If in addition future measurements
include discovery of a new, tighter stellar orbit, then future data could conceivably enable tests
of strong field gravity, by directly measuring the black hole quadrupole moment. With a stellar
orbit similar to that of S2 but at one fifth the distance to the Galactic Center and GRAVITY's resolution
limits on the Galactic Center, we can start to test the no-hair theorem with 20 years of weekly measurements.

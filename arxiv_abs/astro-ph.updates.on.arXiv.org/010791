Modelling the anisotropies in the CIB on all the scales is a challenging task due to the complex nature
of the galaxy evolution and thus often requires too many parameters in order to fit the observational
data. In this paper, we present a new halo model for the anisotropies of the CIB using only four parameters.
Our model connects the mass accretion on the dark matter halos to the star formation rate. Using this
model, we find that the halo mass with the maximum efficiency for converting the accreted baryons
into stars is $\log_{10}M_\mathrm{max} = {12.94}^{+0.02}_{-0.02} \: M_\odot$, consistent with
other studies. Accounting for the mass loss through stellar evolution, we find, for an intermediate
age galaxy, that the star formation efficiency defined as $M_\star(z)/M_b(z)$ is equal to 0.19
and 0.21 at redshift 0.1 and 2 respectively, in good agreement with the values obtained by previous
studies. It is the first time that a CIB model is used to fit Planck and Herschel CIB power spectra simultaneously.
However we find that the large angular scale Planck and Herschel data are not fully compatible with
the small scale Herschel data (for $\ell>3000$). The CIB is expected to be correlated with the tSZ
signal of the galaxy clusters. Using this halo model for the CIB, and a halo model for the tSZ with a
single parameter, we also provide a consistent framework to calculate this cross-correlation,
which requires no extra parameter. The CIB$\times$tSZ correlation is found to be higher when inferred
with a combination of two widely spaced frequency channels (e.g. 143x857 GHz). The CIB, tSZ, and
CIB$\times$tSZ act as foregrounds while measuring the kSZ power spectrum from the CMB power spectrum
and need to be removed. Due to its simplistic nature and low number of parameters, the halo model formalism
presented here is quite useful for such an analysis to measure the kSZ power spectrum accurately.

We investigate the properties of the double sequences of the Milky Way discs visible in the [$\alpha$/Fe]
vs [Fe/H] diagram. In the framework of Galactic formation and evolution, we discuss the complex
relationships between age, metallicity, [$\alpha$/Fe], and the velocity components. We study
stars with measured chemical, seismic and astrometric properties from the APOGEE survey, the Kepler
and Gaia satellites, respectively. We separate the [$\alpha$/Fe]-[Fe/H] diagram into 3 stellar
populations: the thin disc, the high-$\alpha$ metal-poor thick disc and the high-$\alpha$ metal-rich
thick disc and characterise each of these in the age-chemo-kinematics parameter space. We compare
results obtained from different APOGEE data releases and using two recent age determinations.
We use the Besan\c{c}on Galaxy model (BGM) to highlight selection biases and mechanisms not included
in the model. The thin disc exhibits a flat age-metallicity relation while [$\alpha$/Fe] increases
with stellar age. We confirm no correlation between radial and vertical velocities with [Fe/H],
[$\alpha$/Fe] and age for each stellar population. Considering both samples, V$_\varphi$ decreases
with age for the thin disc, while it increases with age for the h$\alpha$mp thick disc. Although the
age distribution of the h$\alpha$mr thick disc is very close to that of the h$\alpha$mp thick disc
between 7 and 14 Gyr, its kinematics seems to follow that of the thin disc. This feature, not predicted
by the hypotheses included in the BGM, suggests a different origin and history for this population.
Finally, we show that there is a maximum dispersion of the vertical velocity, $\sigma_Z$, with age
for the h$\alpha$mp thick disc around 8 Gyr. The comparisons with the BGM simulations suggest a more
complex chemo-dynamical scheme to explain this feature, most likely including mergers and radial
migration effects

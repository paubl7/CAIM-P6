We investigate the dependence of the local galaxy stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR) on galaxy
morphology. We use data from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey DR7 with morphological classifications
from Galaxy Zoo, and compare with the EAGLE cosmological simulation. At fixed halo mass in the mass
range $10^{11.7}-10^{12.9}M_{\odot}$, the median stellar masses of SDSS disc galaxies are up
to a factor of 1.4 higher than the median masses of their elliptical counterparts. However, when
we switch from the stellar masses from Kauffmann et al. to those calculated by Chang et al. or Brinchmann
et al., the median SHMR from discs and ellipticals coincide in this mass range. For halo masses larger
than $10^{13}M_{\odot}$, discs are less massive than ellipticals in same-mass haloes, regardless
of whose stellar mass estimates we use. However, we find that for these high halo masses the results
for discs may be affected by central/satellite misclassifications. The EAGLE simulation predicts
that discs are up to a factor of 1.5 more massive than elliptical galaxies residing in same-mass haloes
less massive than $10^{13}M_{\odot}$, in agreement with the Kauffmann et al. data. Haloes with
masses between $10^{11.5}$ and $10^{12}M_{\odot}$, that host disc galaxies, were assembled earlier
than those hosting ellipticals. This suggests that the discs are more massive because they had more
time for gas accretion and star formation. In $10^{12}-10^{12.5}M_{\odot}$ haloes, the central
black holes in elliptical galaxies grew faster and became more massive than their counterparts
in disc galaxies. This suggests that in this halo mass range the ellipticals are less massive because
AGN feedback ejected more of the halo's gas reservoir, reducing star formation, and suppressing
the (re)growth of stellar discs.

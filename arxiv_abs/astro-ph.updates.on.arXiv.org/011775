Understanding the transport of cosmic rays is challenging our models of propagation in the Galaxy.
A good characterization of the secondary cosmic rays (B, Be, Li and sub-iron species) is crucial
to constrain these models and exploit the precision of modern CR experiments. In this work, a Markov
chain Monte Carlo analysis has been implemented to fit the experimental flux ratios between B, Be
and Li and their flux ratios to the primary cosmic-ray nuclei C and O. We have fitted the data using
two different parametrizations for the spallation cross sections. The uncertainties in the evaluation
of the spectra of these secondary cosmic rays, due to spallation cross sections, have been taken
into account introducing a scale factor as a nuisance parameter in the fits, assuming that this uncertainty
is mostly due to the normalization of the cross sections parametrizations. We have also tested two
different kind of diffusion coefficients, which differ in the origin of the high energy hardening
($\sim 200$ GeV/n) of cosmic rays. Additionally, two different approaches are used to scale the
cross sections, one based on a combined analysis of all the species ("combined" analysis) and the
other reproducing the high energy spectra of the secondary-to-secondary flux ratios of Be/B, Li/B,
Li/Be ("corrected" analysis). This allows us to make a better comparison between the propagation
parameters inferred from both cross sections parametrizations. This novel analysis has been successfully
implemented using the numerical code DRAGON2 dedicated to cosmic-ray propagation to reproduce
the cosmic-ray nuclei data up to $Z=14$ from the AMS-02 experiment. We report the main results, comparing
the different cross sections parametrizations and discussing the impact of these uncertainties.

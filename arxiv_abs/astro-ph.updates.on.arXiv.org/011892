We use 2D particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations to study electron acceleration by electron
temperature anisotropy instabilities, assuming magnetic fields ($B$), electron densities ($n_e$)
and temperatures ($T_e$) typical of the top of contracting magnetic loops in solar flares. We focus
on the long-term effect of $T_{e,\perp} > T_{e,\parallel}$ instabilities by driving the anisotropy
growth during the whole simulation time ($T_{e,\perp}$ and $T_{e,\parallel}$ are the temperatures
perpendicular and parallel to the field). This is achieved by imposing a shear velocity, which amplifies
the field due to magnetic flux freezing, making $T_{e,\perp} > T_{e,\parallel}$ due to electron
magnetic moment conservation. We use the initial conditions: $T_e \sim 52$ MK, and $B$ and $n_e$
such that the ratio between the electron cyclotron and plasma frequencies $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}=0.53$.
When the anisotropy becomes large enough, oblique, quasi-electrostatic (OQES) modes grow, efficiently
scattering the electrons and limiting their anisotropy. After that, when $B$ has grown by a factor
$\sim 2-3$ (corresponding to $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}\sim 1.2-1.5$), the unstable modes become
dominated by parallel, electromagnetic z (PEMZ) modes. In contrast to the OQES dominated regime,
the scattering by PEMZ modes is highly inelastic, producing significant electron acceleration.
When the field has grown by a final factor $\sim 4$, the electron energy spectrum shows a nonthermal
tail that resembles a power-law of index $\sim$ 2.9, plus a high-energy bump reaching $\sim 300$
keV. Our results suggest a critical role played by $\omega_{ce}/\omega_{pe}$ and $T_e$ in determining
the efficiency of electron acceleration by temperature anisotropy instabilities in solar flares.

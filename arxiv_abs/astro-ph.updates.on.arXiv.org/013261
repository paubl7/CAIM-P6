Orbit-determination programs find the orbit solution that best fits a set of observations by minimizing
the RMS of the residuals of the fit. For near-Earth asteroids, the uncertainty of the orbit solution
may be compatible with trajectories that impact Earth. This paper shows how incorporating the impact
condition as an observation in the orbit-determination process results in a robust technique for
finding the regions in parameter space leading to impacts. The impact pseudo-observation residuals
are the b-plane coordinates at the time of close approach and the uncertainty is set to a fraction
of the Earth radius. The extended orbit-determination filter converges naturally to an impacting
solution if allowed by the observations. The uncertainty of the resulting orbit provides an excellent
geometric representation of the virtual impactor. As a result, the impact probability can be efficiently
estimated by exploring this region in parameter space using importance sampling. The proposed
technique can systematically handle a large number of estimated parameters, account for nongravitational
forces, deal with nonlinearities, and correct for non-Gaussian initial uncertainty distributions.
The algorithm has been implemented into a new impact monitoring system at JPL called Sentry-II,
which is undergoing extensive testing. The main advantages of Sentry-II over JPL's currently operating
impact monitoring system Sentry are that Sentry-II can systematically process orbits perturbed
by nongravitational forces and that it is generally more robust when dealing with pathological
cases. The runtimes and completeness of both systems are comparable, with the impact probability
of Sentry-II for 99% completeness being $3\times10^{-7}$.

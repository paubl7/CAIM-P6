Significant clustering around the rarest luminous quasars is a feature predicted by dark matter
theory combined with number density matching arguments. However, this expectation is not reflected
by observations of quasars residing in a diverse range of environments. Here, we assess the tension
in the diverse clustering of visible $i$-band dropout galaxies around luminous $z\sim6$ quasars.
Our approach uses a simple empirical method to derive the median luminosity to halo mass relation,
$L_{c}(M_{h})$ for both quasars and galaxies under the assumption of log-normal luminosity scatter,
$\Sigma_{Q}$ and $\Sigma_{G}$. We show that higher $\Sigma_{Q}$ reduces the average halo mass
hosting a quasar of a given luminosity, thus introducing at least a partial reversion to the mean
in the number count distribution of nearby Lyman-Break galaxies. We generate a large sample of mock
Hubble Space Telescope fields-of-view centred across rare $z\sim6$ quasars by resampling pencil
beams traced through the dark matter component of the BlueTides cosmological simulation. We find
that diverse quasar environments are expected for $\Sigma_{Q}>0.4$, consistent with numerous
observations and theoretical studies. However, we note that the average number of galaxies around
the central quasar is primarily driven by galaxy evolutionary processes in neighbouring halos,
as embodied by our parameter $\Sigma_{G}$, instead of a difference in the large scale structure
around the central quasar host, embodied by $\Sigma_{Q}$. We conclude that models with $\Sigma_{G}>0.3$
are consistent with current observational constraints on high-z quasars, and that such a value
is comparable to the scatter estimated from hydrodynamical simulations of galaxy formation.

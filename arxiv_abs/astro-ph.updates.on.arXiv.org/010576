The Latin American Giant Observatory (LAGO) is a distributed cosmic ray observatory that spans
over Latin America in a wide range of latitudes and altitudes. One of the main goals of LAGO is to study
atmospheric radiation and space weather through the measurement of the secondary particles from
cosmic ray flux at ground level using Water Cherenkov Detectors (WCD). Thus, due to differences
in the local geomagnetic rigidity cut-off affecting the low energy cosmic rays impinging on the
atmosphere and the well-known relation between altitude and the development of the extended atmospheric
showers, different secondary particle fluxes are expected at each LAGO site. It is therefore crucial
for our objectives to be able to determine the expected flux of secondary particles at any place in
the World and for any geomagnetic or atmospheric conditions. To characterize the response of a particular
LAGO site we developed ARTI, a complete framework intended to simulate the WCD signals produced
by the interaction of the secondary inside the detector. ARTI comprises a simulation sequence by
integrating three different simulation tools: a) Magnetocosmics, to account for the geomagnetic
field effects on the primary flux; b) CORSIKA, to simulate the atmospheric showers originated on
the complete flux of cosmic rays and, thus, to estimate the expected flux of secondary particle at
the site; and c) Geant4, for simulating the LAGO detectors response to this secondary flux. In this
work, we show the usage of the ARTI framework by calculating the expected flux of signals at eight
LAGO sites, covering a wide range of altitudes and rigidity cut-offs to emphasize the capabilities
of the LAGO network spanning over Latin America. These results show that we are able to estimate the
response of any water Cherenkov detector located at any place in the World, even under evolving atmospheric
and geomagnetic conditions.

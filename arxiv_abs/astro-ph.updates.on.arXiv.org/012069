Knowledge about the shape of the mass spectrum of compact stars helps in breaking the degeneracy
between the mass and redshift of the gravitational wave (GW) sources and can be used to infer cosmological
parameters in the absence of redshift measurements obtained from electromagnetic observations.
In this paper we study the achievable accuracy and the limits of this approach. We perform cosmological
inference from GW data assuming parametric compact binary population models. We consider two representative
models for the mass spectrum, namely a power-law model between two hard cut-offs at a minimum and
maximum mass, and a similar model combined with a Gaussian peak. Both models exhibit characteristic
scales that allow an indirect estimate of the source redshift. In the case of the LIGO-Virgo detector
network with current and future sensitivities we perform the analysis of an extensive set of simulated
data using a hierarchical Bayesian scheme that jointly fit the source population and cosmological
parameter. We also re-analyse the LIGO-Virgo O2 data. Those analyses all evidence the tight interplay
between source population and cosmological parameters and the influence of initial assumptions
formulated on the ones or the others. We find that: $(i)$ the upper mass cut-off and the position of
the Gaussian peak display the largest correlation with the cosmological parameters; $(ii)$ incorrect
population models may bias the Hubble constant estimate by 40%, or incorrect value for $\Omega_{m,0}$
may lead a significant bias on $H_0$; $(iii)$ the estimates enter the large sample regime with asymptotic
normality and $1/\sqrt{N}$ error decay from $N\sim200$ GW events. Overall, our results suggest
that the inference on source population and cosmological parameters should be addressed \textit{jointly}
and not separately as it is in most studies so far.

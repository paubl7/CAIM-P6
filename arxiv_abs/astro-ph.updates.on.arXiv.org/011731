We derive the stellar-to-halo mass relation (SHMR), namely $f_\star\propto M_\star/M_{\rm h}$
versus $M_\star$ and $M_{\rm h}$, for early-type galaxies from their near-IR luminosities (for
$M_\star$) and the position-velocity distributions of their globular cluster systems (for $M_{\rm
h}$). Our individual estimates of $M_{\rm h}$ are based on fitting a dynamical model with a distribution
function expressed in terms of action-angle variables and imposing a prior on $M_{\rm h}$ from the
concentration-mass relation in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology. We find that the SHMR for
early-type galaxies declines with mass beyond a peak at $M_\star\sim 5\times 10^{10}M_\odot$
and $M_{\rm h}\sim 10^{12}M_\odot$ (near the mass of the Milky Way). This result is consistent with
the standard SHMR derived by abundance matching for the general population of galaxies, and with
previous, less robust derivations of the SHMR for early types. However, it contrasts sharply with
the monotonically rising SHMR for late types derived from extended HI rotation curves and the same
$\Lambda$CDM prior on $M_{\rm h}$ as we adopt for early types. The SHMR for massive galaxies varies
more or less continuously, from rising to falling, with decreasing disc fraction and decreasing
Hubble type. We also show that the different SHMRs for late and early types are consistent with the
similar scaling relations between their stellar velocities and masses (Tully-Fisher and Faber-Jackson
relations). Differences in the relations between the stellar and halo virial velocities account
for the similarity of the scaling relations. We argue that all these empirical findings are natural
consequences of a picture in which galactic discs are built mainly by smooth and gradual inflow,
regulated by feedback from young stars, while galactic spheroids are built by a cooperation between
merging, black-hole fuelling, and feedback from AGNs.

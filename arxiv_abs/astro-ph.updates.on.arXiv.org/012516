Ionized interstellar gas is an important component of the interstellar medium and its lifecycle.
The recent evidence for a widely distributed highly ionized warm interstellar gas with a density
intermediate between the warm ionized medium (WIM) and compact HII regions suggests that there
is a major gap in our understanding of the interstellar gas. Here we investigate the properties of
the dense warm ionized medium (D-WIM) in the Milky Way using spectrally resolved SOFIA GREAT [NII]
205 micron line emission and Green Bank Telescope hydrogen radio recombination lines (RRL) data,
supplemented by Herschel PACS [NII] 122 micron data, and spectrally resolved 12CO. We observed
eight lines of sight in the 20deg <l < 30deg region in the Galactic plane. We derived the kinetic temperature,
and the thermal and turbulent velocity dispersions from the [NII] and RRL linewidths. The regions
with [NII] 205 micron emission are characterized by electron densities, n(e) ~ 10 to 35 cm(-3), temperatures
from 3400 to 8500 K, and column densities N(N+) ~ 7e16 to 3e17 cm(-2). The ionized hydrogen column
densities range from 6e20 to 1.7e21 cm(-2) and the fractional nitrogen ion abundance x(N+) ~1 to
3e-4, implying an enhanced nitrogen abundance at ~ 4.3 kpc from the Galactic Center. The [NII] 205
micron emission coincides with CO emission, although often with an offset in velocity, which suggests
that the D-WIM gas is located in, or near, star-forming regions, which themselves are associated
with molecular gas. These dense ionized regions are found to contribute > 50% of the observed [CII]
intensity along these LOS. The kinetic temperatures we derive are too low to explain the presence
of N+ resulting from electron collisional ionization and/or proton charge transfer of atomic nitrogen.
Rather, these regions most likely are ionized by extreme ultraviolet radiation.

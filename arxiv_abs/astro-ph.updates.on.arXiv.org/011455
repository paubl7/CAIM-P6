The nova rate in the Milky Way remains largely uncertain, despite its vital importance in constraining
models of Galactic chemical evolution as well as understanding progenitor channels for Type Ia
supernovae. The rate has been previously estimated in the range of $\approx10-300$ yr$^{-1}$,
either based on extrapolations from a handful of very bright optical novae or the nova rates in nearby
galaxies; both methods are subject to debatable assumptions. The total discovery rate of optical
novae remains much smaller ($\approx5-10$ yr$^{-1}$) than these estimates, even with the advent
of all-sky optical time domain surveys. Here, we present a systematic sample of 12 spectroscopically
confirmed Galactic novae detected in the first 17 months of Palomar Gattini-IR (PGIR), a wide-field
near-infrared time domain survey. Operating in $J$-band ($\approx1.2$ $\mu$m) that is relatively
immune to dust extinction, the extinction distribution of the PGIR sample is highly skewed to large
extinction values ($> 50$% of events obscured by $A_V\gtrsim5$ mag). Using recent estimates for
the distribution of mass and dust in the Galaxy, we show that the observed extinction distribution
of the PGIR sample is commensurate with that expected from dust models. The PGIR extinction distribution
is inconsistent with that reported in previous optical searches (null hypothesis probability
$< 0.01$%), suggesting that a large population of highly obscured novae have been systematically
missed in previous optical searches. We perform the first quantitative simulation of a $3\pi$ time
domain survey to estimate the Galactic nova rate using PGIR, and derive a rate of $\approx 46.0^{+12.5}_{-12.4}$
yr$^{-1}$. Our results suggest that all-sky near-infrared time-domain surveys are well poised
to uncover the Galactic nova population.

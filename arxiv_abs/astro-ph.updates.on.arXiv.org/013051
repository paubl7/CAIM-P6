Radial-velocity (RV) jitter caused by stellar magnetic activity is an important factor in state-of-the-art
exoplanet discovery surveys such as CARMENES. Stellar rotation, along with heterogeneities in
the photosphere and chromosphere caused by activity, can result in false-positive planet detections.
Hence, it is necessary to determine the stellar rotation period and compare it to any putative planetary
RV signature. Long-term measurements of activity indicators such as the chromospheric emission
in the Ca II H&K lines enable the identification of magnetic activity cycles. In order to determine
stellar rotation periods and study the long-term behavior of magnetic activity of the CARMENES
guaranteed time observations (GTO) sample, it is advantageous to extract Ca II H&K time series from
archival data, since the CARMENES spectrograph does not cover the blue range of the stellar spectrum
containing the Ca II H&K lines. We have assembled a catalog of 11634 archival spectra of 186 M dwarfs
acquired by seven different instruments covering the Ca II H&K regime: ESPADONS, FEROS, HARPS,
HIRES, NARVAL, TIGRE, and UVES. The relative chromospheric flux in these lines was directly extracted
from the spectra by rectification with PHOENIX synthetic spectra via narrow passbands around the
Ca ii H&K line cores. The combination of archival spectra from various instruments results in time
series for 186 stars from the CARMENES GTO sample. As an example of the use of the catalog, we report
the tentative discovery of three previously unknown activity cycles of M dwarfs. We conclude that
the method of extracting Ca II H&K fluxes with the use of model spectra yields consistent results
for different instruments and that the compilation of this catalog will enable the analysis of long-term
activity time series for a large number of M dwarfs.

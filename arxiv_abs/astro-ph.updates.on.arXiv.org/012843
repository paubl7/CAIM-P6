The recent launches of Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Orbiter (SO) and BepiColombo, along with
several older spacecraft, have provided the opportunity to study the solar wind at multiple latitudes
and distances from the Sun simultaneously. We take advantage of this unique spacecraft constellation,
along with low solar activity across two solar rotations between May and July 2020, to investigate
how the solar wind structure, including the Heliospheric Current Sheet (HCS), varies with latitude.
We visualise the sector structure of the inner heliosphere by ballistically mapping the polarity
and solar wind speed from several spacecraft onto the Sun's source surface. We then assess the HCS
morphology and orientation with the in situ data and compare with a predicted HCS shape. We resolve
ripples in the HCS on scales of a few degrees in longitude and latitude, finding that the local orientation
of sector boundaries were broadly consistent with the shape of the HCS but were steepened with respect
to a modelled HCS at the Sun. We investigate how several CIRs varied with latitude, finding evidence
for the compression region affecting slow solar wind outside the latitude extent of the faster stream.
We also identified several transient structures associated with HCS crossings, and speculate
that one such transient may have disrupted the local HCS orientation up to five days after its passage.
We have shown that the solar wind structure varies significantly with latitude, with this constellation
providing context for solar wind measurements that would not be possible with a single spacecraft.
These measurements provide an accurate representation of the solar wind within $\pm 10^{\circ}$
latitude, which could be used as a more rigorous constraint on solar wind models and space weather
predictions. In the future, this range of latitudes will increase as SO's orbit becomes more inclined.

We carry out a multi-probe self-consistency test of the flat $\Lambda$CDM model with the aim of exploring
potential causes of the reported tensions between high- and low-redshift cosmological observations.
We divide the model into two theory regimes determined by the smooth background (geometry) and the
evolution of matter density fluctuations (growth), each governed by an independent set of $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological parameters. This extended model is constrained by a combination of weak gravitational
lensing measurements from the the Kilo-Degree Survey, galaxy clustering signatures extracted
from Sloan Digital Sky Survey campaigns and the Six-Degree Field Galaxy Survey, as well as the angular
baryon acoustic scale and the primordial scalar fluctuation power spectrum measured in $\textit{Planck}$
cosmic microwave background (CMB) data. We find strong consistency between the geometry and growth
parameters, and with the posterior of standard $\Lambda$CDM analysis. Tension in the amplitude
of matter density fluctuations as measured by the parameter $S_8$ persists at around $3\sigma$,
with a $1.5\,\%$ constraint of $S_8 = 0.776_{-0.008}^{+0.016}$ for the combined probes. We also
observe less significant trends (at least $2\sigma$) towards higher values of the Hubble constant
$H_0 = 70.5^{+0.7}_{-1.5}\,{\rm km\, s^{-1} Mpc^{-1}}$ and towards lower values of the total matter
density parameter $\Omega_{\rm{m}} = 0.289^{+0.007}_{-0.005}$ compared to the full $\textit{Planck}$
analysis. Including the subset of the CMB information in the probe combination enhances these differences
rather than alleviate them, which we link to the discrepancy between low and high multipoles in $\textit{Planck}$
data. Our analysis does not yet yield clear signs whether the origin of discrepancies lies in $\Lambda$CDM
structure growth or expansion history.

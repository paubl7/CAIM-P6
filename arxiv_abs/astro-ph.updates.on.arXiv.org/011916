Recently, two classes of quasar samples were identified, which are promising as new cosmological
probes extending to higher redshifts. The first sample uses the nonlinear relation between the
ultraviolet and X-ray luminosities of quasars to derive luminosity distances, whereas the linear
sizes of compact radio quasars in the second sample can serve as standardized rulers, providing
angular-diameter distances. In this study, under the assumption of a flat universe, we refreshed
the calibration of multiple measurements of high-redshift quasars (in the framework of a cosmological-model-independent
method with the newest Hubble parameters data). Furthermore, we placed constraints on four models
that characterize the cosmic equation of state ($w$). The obtained results show that: 1) the two
quasar samples could provide promising complementary probes at much higher redshifts, whereas
compact radio quasars perform better than ultraviolet and X-ray quasars at the current observational
level; 2) strong degeneracy between the cosmic equation of state ($w$) and Hubble constant ($H_0$)
is revealed, which highlights the importance of independent determination of $H_0$ from time-delay
measurements of strongly lensed Quasars; 3)together with other standard ruler probes, such as
baryon acoustic oscillation distance measurements, the combined QSO+BAO measurements are consistent
with the standard $\Lambda$CDM model at a constant equation of state $w=-1$; 4) ranking the cosmological
models, the polynomial parametrization gives a rather good fit among the four cosmic-equation-of-state
models, whereas the Jassal-Bagla-Padmanabhan (JBP) parametrization is substantially penalized
by the Akaike Information Criterion and Bayesian Information Criterion criterion.

The Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) radiation B mode polarization signal contains the unique
signature of primordial metric perturbations produced during the inflation. The separation of
the weak CMB B-mode signal from strong foreground contamination in observed maps is a complex task,
and proposed new generation low noise satellite missions compete with the weak signal level of this
gravitational background. In this article, for the first time, we employ a foreground model-independent
internal linear combination (ILC) method to reconstruct the CMB B mode signal using simulated observations
over large angular scales of the sky of 6 frequency bands of future generation CMB mission Probe of
Inflation and Cosmic Origins (PICO). We estimate the joint CMB B mode posterior density following
the interleaving Gibbs steps of B mode angular power spectrum and cleaned map samples using the ILC
method. We extend and improve the earlier reported Bayesian ILC method to analyze weak CMB B mode
reconstruction by introducing noise bias corrections at two stages during the ILC weight estimation.
By performing $200$ Monte Carlo simulations of the Bayesian ILC method, we find that our method can
reconstruct the CMB signals and the joint posterior density accurately over large angular scales
of the sky. We estimate Blackwell-Rao statistics of the marginal density of CMB B mode angular power
spectrum and use them to estimate the joint density of scalar to tensor ratio $r$ and a lensing power
spectrum amplitude $A^{\textrm{lens}}$. Using $200$ Monte Carlo simulations of the delensing
approach, we find that our method can achieve an unbiased detection of the primordial gravitational
wave signal $r$ with more than 8$\sigma$ significance for levels of $r \geqslant 0.01$.

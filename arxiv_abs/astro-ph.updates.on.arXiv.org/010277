Based on a new selection method of halo stars in the Milky Way local volume, we explore the general
chemo-dynamical structure of the stellar halo. The method relies on the phase-space distribution
defined by the three integrals of motion in an axisymmetric Galactic potential, (E, L_z, I_3), where
I_3 is the third integral of motion. We analyse large samples of stars from SDSSS-SEGUE DR7 and DR16
(APOGEE) catalogs, matched with Gaia DR2, and found that, in this phase-space, halo stars are distinguished
from disk stars by selecting over (1) L_z < 1500 kpc kms^-1 & (2I_3)^{1/2} > 1000 kpc kms^-1, and (2)
E < -1.5 x 10^5 km^2 s^{-2}. The range of I_3 in (1) corresponds to a maximum orbital angle from the Galactic
plane beyond 20~deg. These selection criteria are free from the kinematical biases introduced
by the simple high-velocity cuts adopted in recent literature. The chemo-dynamical analysis confirms
that the halo holds several substructures, including the stellar debris named Gaia Enceladus (GE;
Helmi et al., 2018), but we find that an averaged phased-space distribution, phrased as a "coarse-grained"
distribution, shows a monotonic exponential decrease with increasing E and I_3 like the Michie-Bodenheimer
models. The inner stellar halo described in Carollo et al. (2007,2010) is found to comprise a combination
of GE debris, lowest-E stars (likely in-situ stars), as well as metal-poor prograde stars missed
by the high velocity cuts selection. The very metal poor outer halo, ([Fe/H] < -2.2), exhibits both
retrograde and prograde rotation, with an asymmetric L_z distribution towards high retrograde
motions, and larger $\theta_{\rm orb}$ than those possessed by the GE dominated inner halo. Implication
for the formation of the stellar halo based on our findings are also discussed.

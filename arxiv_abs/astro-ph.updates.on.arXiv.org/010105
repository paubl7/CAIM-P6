We discuss the observed pulsation properties of Type II Cepheids (TIICs) in the Galaxy and Magellanic
Clouds. The period (P) distributions, luminosity amplitudes and population ratios of the three
different sub-groups (BL Herculis[BLH, P<5 days], W Virginis [WV, 5<P<20 days], RV Tauri [RVT,
P>20 days]) are quite similar in different stellar systems, suggesting a common evolutionary channel
and a mild dependence on both metallicity and environment. We present a homogeneous theoretical
framework based on Horizontal Branch (HB) evolutionary models, envisaging that TIICs are mainly
old (t<10 Gyr), low-mass stars. The BLHs are predicted to be post early asymptotic giant branch (PEAGB)
stars (double shell burning) on the verge of reaching their AGB track (first crossing of the instability
strip), while WVs are a mix of PEAGB and post-AGB stars (hydrogen shell burning) moving from cool
to hot (second crossing). Thus suggesting that they are a single group of variable stars. RVTs are
predicted to be a mix of post-AGB stars along their second crossing (short-period tail) and thermally
pulsing AGB stars (long-period tail) evolving towards their white dwarf cooling sequence. We also
present several sets of synthetic HB models by assuming a bimodal mass distribution along the HB.
Theory suggests, in agreement with observations, that TIIC pulsation properties marginally depend
on metallicity. Predicted period distributions and population ratios for BLHs agree quite well
with observations, while those for WVs and RVTs are almost a factor of two smaller and larger than
observed, respectively. Moreover, the predicted period distributions for WVs peak at periods
shorter than observed, while those for RVTs display a long period tail not supported by observations.
We investigate several avenues to explain these differences, but more detailed calculations are
required to address them.

Cosmic ray transport on galactic scales depends on the detailed properties of the magnetized, multiphase
interstellar medium (ISM). In this work, we post-process a high-resolution TIGRESS magnetohydrodynamic
simulation modeling a local galactic disk patch with a two-moment fluid algorithm for cosmic ray
transport. We consider a variety of prescriptions for the cosmic rays, from a simple purely diffusive
formalism with constant scattering coefficient, to a physically-motivated model in which the
scattering coefficient is set by critical balance between streaming-driven Alfv\'en wave excitation
and damping mediated by local gas properties. We separately focus on cosmic rays with kinetic energies
of $\sim 1$ GeV (high-energy) and $\sim 30$~MeV (low-energy), respectively important for ISM dynamics
and chemistry. We find that simultaneously accounting for advection, streaming, and diffusion
of cosmic rays is crucial for properly modeling their transport. Advection dominates in the high-velocity,
low-density, hot phase, while diffusion and streaming are more important in higher density, cooler
phases. Our physically-motivated model shows that there is no single diffusivity for cosmic-ray
transport: the scattering coefficient varies by four or more orders of magnitude, maximal at density
$n_\mathrm{H} \sim 0.01\, \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$. Ion-neutral damping of Alfv\'en waves results
in strong diffusion and nearly uniform cosmic ray pressure within most of the mass of the ISM. However,
cosmic rays are trapped near the disk midplane by the higher scattering rate in the surrounding lower-density,
higher-ionization gas. The transport of high-energy cosmic rays differs from that of low-energy
cosmic rays, with less effective diffusion and greater energy losses for the latter.

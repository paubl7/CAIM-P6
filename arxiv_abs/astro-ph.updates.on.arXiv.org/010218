We study the multi-phase feedback processes in the central ~3 kpc of the barred Sy 2 galaxy NGC 5643.
We use observations of the cold molecular gas (ALMA CO(2-1)) and ionized gas (MUSE IFU). We study
different regions along the outflow zone which extends out to ~2.3 kpc in the same direction (east-west)
as the radio jet, as well as nuclear/circumnuclear regions in the host galaxy disk. The deprojected
outflowing velocities of the cold molecular gas (median Vcentral~189 km s^-1) are generally lower
than those of the outflowing ionized gas, which reach deprojected velocities of up to 750 km s^-1
close to the AGN, and their spatial profiles follow those of the ionized phase. This suggests that
the outflowing molecular gas in the galaxy disk is being entrained by the AGN wind. We derive molecular
and ionized outflow masses of ~5.2x10^7 Msun and 8.5x10^4 Msun and molecular and ionized outflow
mass rates of ~51 Msun yr^-1 and 0.14 Msun yr^-1. Therefore, the molecular phase dominates the outflow
mass and outflow mass rate, while the outflow kinetic power and momentum are similar in both phases.
However, the wind momentum load for the molecular and ionized outflow phases are ~27-5 and <1, which
suggests that the molecular phase is not momentum conserving while the ionized one most certainly
is. The molecular gas content (~1.5x10^7 Msun) of the eastern spiral arm is approximately 50-70%
of the content of the western one. We interpret this as destruction/clearing of the molecular gas
produced by the AGN wind impacting in the host galaxy. The increase of the molecular phase momentum
implies that part of the kinetic energy from the AGN wind is transmitted to the molecular outflow.
This suggest that in Sy-like AGN such as NGC 5643, the radiative/quasar and the kinetic/radio AGN
feedback modes coexist and may shape the host galaxies even at kpc-scales via both positive and (mild)
negative feedback.

The CM carbonaceous chondrite meteorites provide a record of low temperature aqueous reactions
in the early solar system. A number of CM chondrites also experienced short-lived, post-hydration
thermal metamorphism at temperatures of 200C to over 750C. The exact conditions of thermal metamorphism
and the relationship between the unheated and heated CM chondrites are not well constrained but
are crucial to understanding the formation and evolution of hydrous asteroids. Here we have used
position-sensitive-detector X-ray diffraction (PSD-XRD), thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)
and transmission infrared (IR) spectroscopy to characterise the mineralogy and water contents
of 14 heated CM and ungrouped carbonaceous chondrites. We show that heated CM chondrites underwent
the same degree of aqueous alteration as the unheated CMs, however upon thermal metamorphism their
mineralogy initially (300 to 500C) changed from hydrated phyllosilicates to a dehydrated amorphous
phyllosilicate phase. At higher temperatures (over 500C) we observe recrystallisation of olivine
and Fe-sulphides and the formation of metal. Thermal metamorphism also caused the water contents
of heated CM chondrites to decrease from 13 wt percent to 3 wt percent and a subsequent reduction in
the intensity of the 3 micron feature in IR spectra. We estimate that the heated CM chondrites have
lost 15 to 65 percent of the water they contained at the end of aqueous alteration. If impacts were
the main cause of metamorphism, this is consistent with shock pressures of 20 to 50 GPa. However,
not all heated CM chondrites retain shock features suggesting that some were instead heated by solar
radiation. Evidence from the Hayabusa2 and ORSIRS-REx missions suggest that dehydrated materials
may be common on the surfaces of primitive asteroids and our results will support upcoming analysis
of samples returned from asteroids Ryugu and Bennu.

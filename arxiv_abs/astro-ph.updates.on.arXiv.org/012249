A primary goal of exoplanet characterization is to use a planet's current composition to understand
how that planet formed. For example, the C/O ratio has long been recognized as carrying important
information on the chemistry of volatile species. Refractory elements, like Fe, Mg, and Si, are
usually not considered in this conversation because they condense into solids like Fe(s) or MgSiO$_3$
and would be removed from the observable, gaseous atmosphere in exoplanets cooler than about 2000~K.
However, planets hotter than about 2000~K, called ultra-hot Jupiters (UHJs), are warm enough to
largely avoid the condensation of refractory species. In this paper, we explore the insight that
the measurement of refractory abundances can provide into a planet's origins. Through refractory-to-volatile
elemental abundance ratios, we can estimate a planet's atmospheric rock-to-ice fraction and constrain
planet formation and migration scenarios. We first relate a planet's present-day refractory-to-volatile
ratio to its rock-to-ice ratio from formation using various compositional models for the rocky
and icy components of the protoplanetary disk. We discuss potential confounding factors like the
sequestration of heavy metals in the core and condensation. We then show such a measurement using
atmospheric retrievals of the low-resolution UV-IR transmission spectrum of WASP-121b with PETRA,
from which we estimate a refractory-to-volatile ratio of 5.0$^{+6.0}_{-2.7}\times$ solar and
a rock-to-ice ratio greater than 2/3. This result is consistent with significant atmospheric enrichment
by rocky planetismals. Lastly, we discuss the rich future potential for measuring refractory-to-volatile
ratios in ultra-hot Jupiters with the arrival of JWST and by combining observations at low- and high-resolution.

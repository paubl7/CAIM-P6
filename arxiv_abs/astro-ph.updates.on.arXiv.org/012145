Precise information about the composition of the Earth's core is critical to understand planetary
evolution and for discussing current hot topics in geodynamic behavior, such as core-mantle boundary
heat flow. However, samples from deep in the Earth's interior are not available, so our knowledge
is based on comparison of laboratory measurements with seismological observations, informed
by meteorite composition, and indications of the Earth's core temperature. One of the most interesting
results of such work has been the suggestion that Earth's inner core must contain light elements
because the density of the core, as determined from seismological measurements, is lower than the
density of pure iron, its main constituent, as determined from laboratory measurements and/or
theoretical work: the density deficit is now considered to be ~4%. However, this conclusion relies
critically on having an accurate pressure scale to relate lab generated pressures to geological
pressures. Establishing such a scale has been the subject of intensive research but still involves
significant extrapolation and approximations, especially at higher pressures. Further, a pressure
scale to the multi-megabar pressures is indispensable for discussing super-Earth planets. Here
we establish the first primary pressure scale extending to the multi-megabar pressures of Earth's
core by measuring acoustic phonon velocities using inelastic scattering from a rhenium sample
in a diamond anvil cell. Our new pressure scale agrees with previous primary scales at lower pressures
and also shock compression experiments, but is significantly different from previous secondary
and theoretical scales at Earth's core pressures: previous scales have overestimated, by at least
20%, laboratory pressures at 230 gigapascals. Our new scale suggests the density deficit of the
inner core is ~9%, doubling the light-element content of the core.

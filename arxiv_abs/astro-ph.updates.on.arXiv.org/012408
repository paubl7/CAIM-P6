Mass-independent isotopic anomalies of carbonaceous and non-carbonaceous meteorites show a
clear dichotomy suggesting an efficient separation of the inner and outer solar system. Observations
show that ring-like structures in the distribution of mm-sized pebbles in protoplanetary disks
are common. These structures are often associated with drifting pebbles being trapped by local
pressure maxima in the gas disk. Similar structures may also have existed in the sun's natal disk,
which could naturally explain the meteorite/planetary isotopic dichotomy. Here, we test the effects
of a strong pressure bump in the outer disk (e.g. $\sim$5~au) on the formation of the inner solar system.
We model dust coagulation and evolution, planetesimal formation, as well as embryo's growth via
planetesimal and pebble accretion. Our results show that terrestrial embryos formed via planetesimal
accretion rather than pebble accretion. In our model, the radial drift of pebbles foster planetesimal
formation. However, once a pressure bump forms, pebbles in the inner disk are lost via drift before
they can be efficiently accreted by embryos growing at $\gtrapprox$1~au. Embryos inside $\sim$0.5-1.0au
grow relatively faster and can accrete pebbles more efficiently. However, these same embryos grow
to larger masses so they should migrate inwards substantially, which is inconsistent with the current
solar system. Therefore, terrestrial planets most likely accreted from giant impacts of Moon to
roughly Mars-mass planetary embryos formed around $\gtrapprox$1.0~au. Finally, our simulations
produce a steep radial mass distribution of planetesimals in the terrestrial region which is qualitatively
aligned with formation models suggesting that the asteroid belt was born low-mass.

The analysis of current and future cosmological surveys of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) at high-redshift
depends on the accurate photometric classification of the SN events detected. Generating realistic
simulations of photometric SN surveys constitutes an essential step for training and testing photometric
classification algorithms, and for correcting biases introduced by selection effects and contamination
arising from core collapse SNe in the photometric SN Ia samples. We use published SN time-series
spectrophotometric templates, rates, luminosity functions and empirical relationships between
SNe and their host galaxies to construct a framework for simulating photometric SN surveys. We present
this framework in the context of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) 5-year photometric SN sample, comparing
our simulations of DES with the observed DES transient populations. We demonstrate excellent agreement
in many distributions, including Hubble residuals, between our simulations and data. We estimate
the core collapse fraction expected in the DES SN sample after selection requirements are applied
and before photometric classification. After testing different modelling choices and astrophysical
assumptions underlying our simulation, we find that the predicted contamination varies from 5.8
to 9.3 per cent, with an average of 7.0 per cent and r.m.s. of 1.1 per cent. Our simulations are the first
to reproduce the observed photometric SN and host galaxy properties in high-redshift surveys without
fine-tuning the input parameters. The simulation methods presented here will be a critical component
of the cosmology analysis of the DES photometric SN Ia sample: correcting for biases arising from
contamination, and evaluating the associated systematic uncertainty.

Context: Solar eruptions, such as coronal mass ejections (CMEs), are often accompanied by accelerated
electrons that can in turn emit radiation at radio wavelengths. This radiation is observed as solar
radio bursts. The main types of bursts associated with CMEs are type II and type IV bursts that can
sometimes show movement in the direction of the CME expansion, either radially or laterally. However,
the propagation of radio bursts with respect to CMEs has only been studied for individual events.
Aims: Here, we perform a statistical study of 64 moving bursts with the aim to determine how often
CMEs are accompanied by moving radio bursts. This is done in order to ascertain the usefulness of
using radio images in estimating the early CME expansion. Methods: Using radio imaging from the
Na\c{c}ay Radioheliograph (NRH), we constructed a list of moving radio bursts, defined as bursts
that move across the plane of sky at a single frequency. We define their association with CMEs and
the properties of associated CMEs using white-light coronagraph observations. We also determine
their connection to classical type II and type IV radio burst categorisation. Results: We find that
just over a quarter of type II and half of type IV bursts that occurred during the NRH observing windows
in Solar Cycle 24 are accompanied by moving radio emission. All but one of the moving radio bursts
are associated with white--light CMEs and the majority of moving bursts (90%) are associated with
wide CMEs (>60 degrees in width). In particular, all but one of the moving bursts corresponding to
type IIs are associated with wide CMEs; however, and unexpectedly, the majority of type II moving
bursts are associated with slow white-light CMEs (<500 km/s). On the other hand, the majority of
moving type IV bursts are associated with fast CMEs (>500 km/s).

Remnant radio galaxies represent an important phase in the life-cycle of radio active galactic
nuclei. It is suggested that in this phase, the jets have switched off and the extended emission is
fading rapidly. This phase is not well-studied due to the lack of statistical samples observed at
both low and high frequencies. In this work, we study a sample of 23 candidate remnant radio galaxies
previously selected using the Low Frequency Array at 150 MHz in the Lockman Hole field. We examine
their morphologies and study their spectral properties to confirm their remnant nature and revise
the morphological and spectral criteria used to define the initial sample. We present new observations
with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array at 6000 MHz at both high and low resolution. These observations
allowed us to observe the presence or absence of cores and study the spectral curvature and steepness
of the spectra of the total emission expected at these high frequencies for the remnant candidates.
We confirm 13 out of 23 candidates as remnant radio sources. This corresponds to 7% of the full sample
of active, restarted, and remnant candidates from the Lockman Hole field. Surprisingly, only a
minority of remnants reside in a cluster (23%). The remnant radio galaxies show a range of properties
and morphologies. The majority do not show detection of the core at 6000 MHz and their extended emission
often shows ultra-steep spectra (USS). However, there are also remnants with USS total emission
and a detection of the core at 6000 MHz, possibly indicating a variety of evolutionary stages in the
remnant phase. We confirm the importance of the combination of morphological and spectral criteria
and this needs to be taken into consideration when selecting a sample of remnant radio sources.

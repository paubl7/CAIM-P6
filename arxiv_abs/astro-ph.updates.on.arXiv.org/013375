Chameleon gravity is an example of a model that gives rise to interesting phenomenology on cosmological
scales while simultaneously possessing a screening mechanism, allowing it to avoid solar system
constraints. Such models result in non-linear field equations, which can be solved analytically
only in simple highly symmetric systems. In this work we study the equation of motion of a scalar-tensor
theory with chameleon screening using the finite element method. More specifically, we solve the
field equation for spherical and triaxial NFW cluster-sized halos. This allows a detailed investigation
of the relationship between the NFW concentration and the virial mass parameters and the magnitude
of the chameleon acceleration, as measured at the virial radius. In addition, we investigate the
effects on the chameleon acceleration due to halo triaxiality. We focus on the parameter space regions
that are still allowed by the observational constraints. We find that given our dataset, the largest
allowed value for the chameleon-to-NFW acceleration ratio at the virial radius is $\sim 10^{-7}$.
This result strongly indicates that the chameleon models that are still allowed by the observational
constraints would not lead to any measurable effects on galaxy cluster scales. Nonetheless, we
also find that there is a direct relationship between the NFW potential and the chameleon-to-NFW
acceleration ratio at the virial radius. Similarly, there is a direct (yet a much more complicated)
relationship between the NFW concentration, the virial mass and the acceleration ratios at the
virial radius. Finally, we find that triaxiality introduces extra directional effects on the acceleration
measurements. These effects in combination could potentially be used in future observational
searches for fifth forces.

Massive star evolution at low metallicity is closely connected to many fields in high-redshift
astrophysics, but poorly understood. The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a unique laboratory to
study this because of its metallicity of 0.2 Zsol, its proximity, and because it is currently forming
stars. We used a spectral type catalog in combination with GAIA magnitudes to calculate temperatures
and luminosities of bright SMC stars. By comparing these with literature studies, we tested the
validity of our method, and using GAIA data, we estimated the completeness of stars in the catalog
as a function of luminosity. This allowed us to obtain a nearly complete view of the most luminous
stars in the SMC. When then compared with stellar evolution predictions. We also calculated the
extinction distribution, the ionizing photon production rate, and the star formation rate. Our
results imply that the SMS hosts only 30 very luminous main-sequence stars (M > 40 Msol; L > 10^5 Lsol),
which are far fewer than expected from the number of stars in the luminosity range 3*10^4 < L/Lsol
< 3*10^5 and from the typically quoted star formation rate in the SMC. Even more striking, we find
that for masses above M > 20 Msol, stars in the first half of their hydrogen-burning phase are almost
absent. This mirrors a qualitatively similar peculiarity that is known for the Milky Way and Large
Magellanic Cloud. This amounts to a lack of hydrogen-burning counterparts of helium-burning stars,
which is more pronounced for higher luminosities. We argue that a declining star formation rate
or a steep initial mass function are unlikely to be the sole explanations for the dearth of young bright
stars. Instead, many of these stars might be embedded in their birth clouds, although observational
evidence for this is weak. We discuss implications for cosmic reionization and the top end of the
initial mass function.

The observation of the first pulse-to-pulse glitch in the Vela pulsar opens a new window on the internal
dynamics of neutron stars. We study the minimal three-component model for pulsar glitches by solving
it with generic initial conditions. The purpose is to use this solution to fit the data of the 2016
Vela glitch by employing a Bayesian approach and to obtain a probability distribution for the physical
parameters of the model and for observational parameters, such as the glitch rise time and the relaxation
timescale. The fit is achieved through Bayesian inference. Due to the presence of an increase in
the timing residuals near the glitch time, an extra magnetospheric component was added to the three-component
model to deal with this phenomenon. A physically reasonable, non-informative prior was set on the
parameters of the model, so that the posterior distribution could be compared with information
obtained from microphysical calculations. By considering a model with a tightened prior on the
moment of inertia fractions and by comparing it with the original model by means of Bayesian model
selection, we studied the possibility of a crust-limited superfluid reservoir. We obtained the
posterior distribution for the moment of inertia fractions of the superfluid components, the coupling
parameters, and the initial velocity lags between the components. An analysis of the inferred posterior
also confirmed the presence of an overshoot in that glitch and set an upper limit of $\sim 6\,$s on
the glitch rise timescale. The comparison between the two models with different priors on the moment
of inertia fractions appears to indicate a need for a core participation in the glitch phenomenon,
regardless of the uncertain strength of the entrainment coupling.

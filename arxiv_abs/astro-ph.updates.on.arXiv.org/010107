We study the effect of stellar feedback (photodissociation/ionization, radiation pressure and
winds) on the evolution of a Giant Molecular Cloud (GMC), by means of a 3D radiative transfer, hydro-simulation
implementing a complex chemical network featuring ${\rm H}_2$ formation and destruction. We track
the formation of individual stars with mass $M>1\,{\rm M}_\odot$ with a stochastic recipe. Each
star emits radiation according to its spectrum, sampled with 10 photon bins from near-infrared
to extreme ultra-violet bands; winds are implemented by energy injection in the neighbouring cells.
We run a simulation of a GMC with mass $M=10^5\,{\rm M}_\odot$, following the evolution of different
gas phases. Thanks to the simultaneous inclusion of different stellar feedback mechanisms, we
identify two stages in the cloud evolution: (1) radiation and winds carve ionized, low-density
bubbles around massive stars, while FUV radiation dissociates most ${\rm H}_2$ in the cloud, apart
from dense, self-shielded clumps; (2) rapid star formation (SFR$\simeq 0.1\,{\rm M}_\odot\,{\rm
yr}^{-1}$) consumes molecular gas in the dense clumps, so that UV radiation escapes and ionizes
the remaining HI gas in the GMC. ${\rm H}_2$ is exhausted in $1.6$ Myr, yielding a final star formation
efficiency of 36 per cent. The average intensity of FUV and ionizing fields increases almost steadily
with time; by the end of the simulation ($t=2.5$ Myr) we find $\langle G_0 \rangle \simeq 10^3$ (in
Habing units), and a ionization parameter $\langle U_{\rm ion} \rangle \simeq 10^2$, respectively.
The ionization field has also a more patchy distribution than the FUV one within the GMC. Throughout
the evolution, the escape fraction of ionizing photons from the cloud is $f_{\rm ion, esc} < 0.03$.

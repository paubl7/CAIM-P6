To make best use of data sets in the age of multi-messenger astronomy and the results of nuclear experimental
and theoretical studies, probability distributions of neutron star models that can be used to propagate
errors from one domain to another are required. Using two distributions of nuclear symmetry energy
parameters - one uniform, the other based on pure neutron matter (PNM) theory, we prepare two ensembles
of neutron star crust models. We use an extended Skyrme energy-density functional within a compressible
liquid drop model (CLDM) to compute crust models. We fit the surface parameters of the CLDM to quantum
3D Hartree-Fock calculations of nuclei in a neutron gas at crustal densities and show the resulting
distributions of crust-core transition properties, and, for the first time, the properties of
the crust layer where nuclear pasta first appears. All models predict more than 50% of the crust by
mass and 15% of the crust by thickness comprises pasta with medians of around 62% for the mass of pasta
and 30% for the thickness of pasta in the crust. We also present 68% and 95% ranges for the crust composition,
shear modulus, melting temperature and frozen-composition adiabatic index as a function of density.
We examine the relationships between crust-core boundary and pasta transition properties, the
thickness of the pasta layers, the symmetry energy at saturation and sub-saturation densities
and the neutron skins of Pb208 and Ca48. We quantify the correlations using the maximal information
coefficient, which can effectively characterize non-linear relationships. Future measurements
of Pb208 and Ca48, information from nuclear masses and giant resonances, and constraints on PNM
from ab-initio theoretical methods will be able to place strong constraints on the location of the
pasta layers, the crust-core boundary and the amount of pasta in the crust.

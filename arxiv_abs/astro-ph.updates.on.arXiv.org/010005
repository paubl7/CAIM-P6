Turbulence in the intracluster, intragroup, and circumgalactic medium plays a crucial role in
the self-regulated feeding and feedback loop of central supermassive black holes. We dissect the
three-dimensional turbulent `weather' in a high-resolution Eulerian simulation of active galactic
nucleus (AGN) feedback, shown to be consistent with multiple multi-wavelength observables of
massive galaxies. We carry out post-processing simulations of Lagrangian tracers to track the
evolution of enstrophy, a proxy of turbulence, and its related sinks and sources. This allows us
to isolate in depth the physical processes that determine the evolution of turbulence during the
recurring strong and weak AGN feedback events, which repeat self-similarly over the Gyr evolution.
We find that the evolution of enstrophy/turbulence in the gaseous halo is highly dynamic and variable
over small temporal and spatial scales, similar to the chaotic weather processes on Earth. We observe
major correlations between the enstrophy amplification and recurrent AGN activity, especially
via its kinetic power. While advective and baroclinc motions are always sub-dominant, stretching
motions are the key sources of the amplification of enstrophy, in particular along the jet/cocoon,
while rarefactions decrease it throughout the bulk of the volume. This natural self-regulation
is able to preserve, as ensemble, the typically-observed subsonic turbulence during cosmic time,
superposed by recurrent spikes via impulsive anisotropic AGN features (wide outflows, bubbles,
cocoon shocks). This study facilitates the preparation and interpretation of the thermo-kinematical
observations enabled by new revolutionary X-ray IFU telescopes, such as XRISM and Athena.

Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are large-scale eruptions from the Sun into interplanetary space.
Despite being major space weather drivers, our knowledge of the CME properties in the inner heliosphere
remains constrained by the scarcity of observations at distances other than 1 au. Furthermore,
most CMEs are observed in situ by single spacecraft, requiring numerical models to complement the
sparse observations available. We aim to assess the ability of the linear force-free spheromak
CME model in EUHFORIA to describe the radial evolution of interplanetary CMEs, yielding new context
for observational studies. We model one well-studied CME, and investigate its radial evolution
by placing virtual spacecraft along the Sun-Earth line in the simulation domain. To directly compare
observational and modelling results, we characterise the interplanetary CME signatures between
0.2 and 1.9 au from modelled time series, exploiting techniques traditionally employed to analyse
real in situ data. Results show that the modelled radial evolution of the mean solar wind and CME values
is consistent with observational and theoretical expectations. The CME expands as a consequence
of the decaying pressure in the surrounding wind: the expansion is rapid within 0.4 au, and moderate
at larger distances. The early rapid expansion could not explain the overestimated CME radial size
in our simulation, suggesting this is an intrinsic limitation of the spheromak geometry used. The
magnetic field profile indicates a relaxation of the CME during propagation, while ageing is most
probably not a substantial source of magnetic asymmetry beyond 0.4 au. We also report a CME wake that
is significantly shorter than suggested by observations. Overall, EUHFORIA provides a consistent
description of the radial evolution of solar wind and CMEs; nevertheless, improvements are required
to better reproduce the CME radial extension.

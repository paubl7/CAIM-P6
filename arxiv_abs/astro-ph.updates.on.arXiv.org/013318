This paper attempts to elucidate how Kerr black holes manage to radiate energy through their force-free
magnetospheres specified by the two conserved quantities; the field-line angular velocity $\Omega_{F}(\Psi)$
and the current-angular momentum flux function $I(\Psi)$, where $\Psi$ is the stream function.
To comply with the first law of thermodynamics, with the help of the frame-dragging angular velocity
$\omega$, the energy-angular momentum flux relation is modified like ${\bf S}_{\rm E}={\bf S}_{\rm
EM}+{\bf S}_{\rm SD}=\Omega_{F}{\bf S}_{\rm J}$, where ${\bf S}_{\rm EM}= \Omega_{{\rm F}\omega}{\bf
S}_{\rm J}$ is the Poynting flux, $\Omega_{{\rm F}\omega}=\Omega_{{\rm F}}-\omega$ is the ZAMO-measured
angular-velocity (ZAMOs are the zero-angular-momentum-observers), and ${\bf S}_{\rm SD}=\omega{\bf
S}_{\rm J}$ is the spin-down flux. For $\Omega_{F}(\Psi)$ and its overall value $\bar{\Omega}_{\rm
F}$, the second law imposes $0\lo\Omega_{\rm F}\approx\bar{\Omega}_{\rm F}\lo{\Omega}_{\rm
H}$, where $\Omega_{\rm H}$ is the hole's angular-velocity. The null surface S$_{\rm N}$, where
${\Omega}_{{\rm F}\omega}={\bf S}_{\rm EM}=0$, always exists to break down the freezing-in and
force-free conditions, resulting in severance of both current- and stream-lines there, thereby
dividing the magnetosphere into the two domains by ${\Omega}_{{\rm F}\omega}\ggel 0$. Oppositely
to the outer domain ${\Omega}_{{\rm F}\omega}>0$, the counter-rotation of the inner domain ${\Omega}_{{\rm
F}\omega}<0$ gives rise to an influx of negative angular momentum, which couples with the frame-dragging
effect, to induce an influx of {negative} energy, i.e., the outflow of {positive} spin-down energy.
The voltage drop between the two batteries at S$_{\rm N}$ will kind of spark-discharge to steadily
produce pair-particles, making S$_{\rm N}$ widened to the `zero-angular-momentum-Gap' filled
with ZAM-particles.

Since July 2014, the Gaia mission has been engaged in a high-spatial-resolution, time-resolved,
precise, accurate astrometric, and photometric survey of the entire sky. Aims: We present the Gaia
Science Alerts project, which has been in operation since 1 June 2016. We describe the system which
has been developed to enable the discovery and publication of transient photometric events as seen
by Gaia. Methods: We outline the data handling, timings, and performances, and we describe the transient
detection algorithms and filtering procedures needed to manage the high false alarm rate. We identify
two classes of events: (1) sources which are new to Gaia and (2) Gaia sources which have undergone
a significant brightening or fading. Validation of the Gaia transit astrometry and photometry
was performed, followed by testing of the source environment to minimise contamination from Solar
System objects, bright stars, and fainter near-neighbours. Results: We show that the Gaia Science
Alerts project suffers from very low contamination, that is there are very few false-positives.
We find that the external completeness for supernovae, $C_E=0.46$, is dominated by the Gaia scanning
law and the requirement of detections from both fields-of-view. Where we have two or more scans the
internal completeness is $C_I=0.79$ at 3 arcsec or larger from the centres of galaxies, but it drops
closer in, especially within 1 arcsec. Conclusions: The per-transit photometry for Gaia transients
is precise to 1 per cent at $G=13$, and 3 per cent at $G=19$. The per-transit astrometry is accurate
to 55 milliarcseconds when compared to Gaia DR2. The Gaia Science Alerts project is one of the most
homogeneous and productive transient surveys in operation, and it is the only survey which covers
the whole sky at high spatial resolution (subarcsecond), including the Galactic plane and bulge.

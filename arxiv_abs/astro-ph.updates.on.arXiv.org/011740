The Very Large Array Sky Survey (VLASS) is observing the entire sky north of $-40^{\circ}$ in the
S-band ($2<\nu<4\,$GHz), with the highest angular resolution ($2''.5$) of any all-sky radio continuum
survey to date. VLASS will cover its entire footprint over three distinct epochs, the first of which
has now been observed in full. Based on rapidly produced Quick Look images from this first epoch,
we have created a catalog of $1.7\times10^{6}$ reliably detected radio components with $S_{\text{peak}}\gtrsim1\,$mJy/beam.
We describe the production of this catalog and quantify the impact of the limited-quality Quick
Look images on the scientific usability of the resultant data. Comparisons with independent observations
show that flux density measurements at $S_{\text{peak}}\gtrsim3\,$mJy/beam are systematically
underestimated by $\sim10\,\%$. Components with $S_\text{peak}<3\,$mJy/beam often have unreliable
flux density measurements. We use this catalog to perform a statistical analysis of the $\nu \sim
3\,$GHz radio sky. Comparisons with the Faint Images of the Radio Sky at Twenty cm survey (FIRST)
show the typical $1.4-3\,$GHz spectral index to be $\alpha\sim-0.76$. The radio color-color distribution
of both point and extended VLASS components is explored by matching with FIRST and the LOFAR Two Meter
Sky Survey. The VLASS $dN/dS$ is presented and found to be consistent with previous observations
at both $1.4$ and $3\,$GHz. The improved resolution of VLASS relative to FIRST is demonstrated by
excess power in the VLASS two-point correlation function at $\theta\lesssim 7''$, and by $17\,\%$
of active galactic nuclei associated with single FIRST component being observed as multi-component
sources by VLASS.

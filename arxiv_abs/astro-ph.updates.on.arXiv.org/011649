Velocity field provides a complementary avenue to constrain cosmological information, either
through the peculiar velocity surveys or the kinetic Sunyaev Zel'dovich effect. One of the commonly
used statistics is the mean radial pairwise velocity. Here, we consider the three-point mean relative
velocity, i.e. the mean relative velocities between pairs in a triplet. Using halo catalogs from
the Quijote suite of N-body simulations, we first showcase how the analytical prediction for the
mean relative velocities between pairs in a triplet achieve better than 4-5% accuracy using standard
perturbation theory at leading order for triangular configurations with a minimum separation
of $r \geq 50\ h^{-1}$Mpc. Furthermore, we present the three-point relative velocity as a novel
probe of neutrino mass estimation. We explore the full cosmological information content of the
halo mean pairwise velocities, and the mean relative velocities between halo pairs in a triplet.
We undertake this through the Fisher-matrix formalism using 22,000 simulations from the Quijote
suite, and considering all triangular configurations with a minimum and a maximum separation of
$20\ h^{-1}$Mpc and $120\ h^{-1}$Mpc, respectively. We find that the mean relative velocities
in a triplet allows a 1$\sigma$ neutrino mass ($M_\nu$) constraint of 0.065 eV, that is roughly 13
times better than the mean pairwise velocity constraint (0.877 eV). This information gain is not
limited only to neutrino mass, but extends to other cosmological parameters: $\Omega_{\mathrm{m}}$,
$\Omega_{\mathrm{b}}$, $h$, $n_{\mathrm{s}}$ and $\sigma_{8}$ achieving a gain of 8.9, 11.8,
15.5, 20.9 and 10.9 times respectively. These results illustrate the possibility of exploiting
the mean three-point relative velocities for constraining the cosmological parameters accurately
from future cosmic microwave background experiments and peculiar velocity surveys.

Models of solar-like oscillators yield acoustic modes at different frequencies than would be seen
in actual stars possessing identical interior structure, due to modelling error near the surface.
This asteroseismic "surface term" must be corrected when mode frequencies are used to infer stellar
structure. Subgiants exhibit oscillations of mixed acoustic ($p$-mode) and gravity ($g$-mode)
character, which defy description by the traditional $p$-mode asymptotic relation. Since nonparametric
diagnostics of the surface term rely on this description, they cannot be applied to subgiants directly.
In Paper I, we generalised such nonparametric methods to mixed modes, and showed that traditional
surface-term corrections only account for mixed-mode coupling to, at best, first order in a perturbative
expansion. Here, we apply those results, modelling subgiants using asteroseismic data. We demonstrate
that, for grid-based inference of subgiant properties using individual mode frequencies, neglecting
higher-order effects of mode coupling in the surface term results in significant systematic differences
in the inferred stellar masses, and measurable systematics in other fundamental properties. While
these systematics are smaller than those resulting from other choices of model construction, they
persist for both parametric and nonparametric formulations of the surface term. This suggests
that mode coupling should be fully accounted for when correcting for the surface term in seismic
modelling with mixed modes, irrespective of the choice of correction used. The inferred properties
of subgiants, in particular masses and ages, also depend on the choice of surface-term correction,
in a different manner from both main-sequence and red giant stars.

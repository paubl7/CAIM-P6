Stars can be consumed (either tidally disrupted or swallowed whole) by massive black holes (MBHs)
at galactic centers when they move into the vicinity of the MBHs. In this study, we investigate the
rates of stellar consumption by central MBHs and their cosmic distributions, including the effects
of triaxial galaxy shapes in enhancing the reservoir of low-angular-momentum stars and incorporating
realistic galaxy distributions. We find that the enhancement in the stellar consumption rates
due to triaxial galaxy shapes can be significant, by a factor of ~3 for MBH mass $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^5$-$10^6$Msun
and up to more than one order of magnitude for $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^8$Msun. Only for $M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^7$Msun
are the stellar consumption rates significantly higher in galaxies with steeper inner surface
brightness profiles. The average (per galaxy) stellar consumption rates correlate with central
MBH masses positively for $M_{\rm BH}\gtrsim10^7$Msun and negatively for $M_{\rm BH}\lesssim10^7$Msun.
The volumetric stellar tidal disruption rates are ~$3\times10^{-5}$/yr/Mpc$^3$ for MBHs in the
mass range of $10^5$-$10^8$Msun at z=0; and the volumetric stellar consumption rates by MBHs with
higher masses are ~$10^{-6}$/yr/Mpc$^3$, which can be the stellar tidal disruption rate if the
high-mass BHs are extremely spinning Kerr BHs or the rate of being swallowed if those BHs are Schwarzschild
ones. The volumetric stellar consumption rates decrease with increasing redshift, and the decrease
is relatively mild for $M_{\rm BH}\sim10^5$-$10^7$Msun and stronger for higher $M_{\rm BH}$.
Most of the stellar tidal disruption events (TDEs) at z=0 occur in galaxies with mass $M_{\rm gal}\lesssim10^{11}$Msun,
and about 1%-2% of the TDEs can occur in high-mass galaxies with $M_{\rm gal}\gtrsim10^{11}$Msun.

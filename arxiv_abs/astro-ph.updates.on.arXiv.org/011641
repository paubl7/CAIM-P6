We analyse the large-scale clustering in Fourier space of emission line galaxies (ELG) from the
Data Release 16 of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey.
The ELG sample contains 173,736 galaxies covering 1,170 square degrees in the redshift range $0.6
< z < 1.1$. We perform a BAO measurement from the post-reconstruction power spectrum monopole, and
study redshift space distortions (RSD) in the first three even multipoles. Photometric variations
yield fluctuations of both the angular and radial survey selection functions. Those are directly
inferred from data, imposing integral constraints which we model consistently. The full data set
has only a weak preference for a BAO feature ($1.4\sigma$). At the effective redshift $z_{\rm eff}
= 0.845$ we measure $D_{\rm V}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 18.33_{-0.62}^{+0.57}$, with $D_{\rm
V}$ the volume-averaged distance and $r_{\rm drag}$ the comoving sound horizon at the drag epoch.
In combination with the RSD measurement, at $z_{\rm eff} = 0.85$ we find $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff})
= 0.289_{-0.096}^{+0.085}$, with $f$ the growth rate of structure and $\sigma_8$ the normalisation
of the linear power spectrum, $D_{\rm H}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 20.0_{-2.2}^{+2.4}$ and
$D_{\rm M}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 19.17 \pm 0.99$ with $D_{\rm H}$ and $D_{\rm M}$ the Hubble
and comoving angular distances, respectively. These results are in agreement with those obtained
in configuration space, thus allowing a consensus measurement of $f\sigma_8(z_{\rm eff}) = 0.315
\pm 0.095$, $D_{\rm H}(z_{\rm eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 19.6_{-2.1}^{+2.2}$ and $D_{\rm M}(z_{\rm
eff})/r_{\rm drag} = 19.5 \pm 1.0$. This measurement is consistent with a flat $\Lambda$CDM model
with Planck parameters.

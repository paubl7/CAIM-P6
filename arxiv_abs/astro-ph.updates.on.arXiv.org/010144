Observations at intermediate redshifts reveal the presence of numerous, compact, weak MgII absorbers
with near to super-solar metallicities, often surrounded by more extended regions that produce
CIV and/or OVI absorption in the circumgalactic medium at large impact parameters from luminous
galaxies. Their origin and nature remains unclear. We hypothesize that undetected, satellite
dwarf galaxies are responsible for producing some of these weak MgII absorbers. We test our hypothesis
using gas dynamical simulations of galactic outflows from a dwarf satellite galaxy with a halo mass
of $5\times10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$, which could form in a larger $L^{*}$ halo at z=2, to study the gas
interaction in the halo. We find that thin, filamentary, weak MgII absorbers are produced in two
stages: 1) when shocked core collapse supernova (SNII) enriched gas descending in a galactic fountain
gets shock compressed by upward flows driven by subsequent SNIIs and cools (phase 1), and later,
2) during an outflow driven by Type Ia supernovae that shocks and sweeps up pervasive SNII enriched
gas, which then cools (phase 2). The width of the filaments and fragments are $\lesssim~100$ pc,
and the smallest ones cannot be resolved at 12.8 pc resolution. The MgII absorbers in our simulations
are continuously generated for >150 Myr by shocks and cooling, though each cloud survives for only
~60 Myr. Their metallicity is 10-20% solar metallicity and column density is $<10^{12}$ cm$^{-2}$.
They are also surrounded by larger (0.5-1 kpc) CIV absorbers that seem to survive longer. In addition,
larger-scale (>1 kpc) CIV and OVI clouds are produced in both expanding and shocked SNII enriched
gas which is photoionized by the UV metagalactic radiation at intermediate redshift. Our simulation
highlights the possibility of dwarf galactic outflows producing highly enriched multiphase gas.

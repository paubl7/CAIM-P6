Aims: We investigate the orbital and phase space properties of loss cone stars that interact strongly
with a hard, high-redshift binary supermassive black hole (SMBH) system formed in a cosmological
scenario. Methods: We use a novel hybrid integration approach that combines the direct N-body code
$\varphi$-GRAPE with ETICS, a collisionless code that employs the self-consistent field method
for force calculation. The hybrid approach shows considerable speed-up over direct summation
for particle numbers $> 10^6$, while retaining accuracy of direct N-body for a subset of particles.
During the SMBH binary evolution we monitor individual stellar interactions with the binary in
order to identify stars that noticeably contribute to the SMBH binary hardening. Results: We successfully
identify and analyze in detail the properties of stars that extract energy from the binary. We find
that the summed energy changes seen in these stars match very well with the overall binary energy
change, demonstrating that stellar interactions are the primary drivers of SMBH binary hardening
in triaxial, gas-poor systems. The slight triaxiality of our system results in efficient loss cone
refilling, avoiding the final parsec problem. We distinguish three different populations of interactions
based on their apocenter. We find a clear prevalence of interactions co-rotating with the binary.
Nevertheless, retrograde interactions are the most energetic, contributing only slightly less
than the prograde population to the overall energy exchange. The most energetic interactions are
also likely to result in a change of sign in the angular momentum of the star. We estimate the merger
timescale of the binary to be $\approx 20$ $\mathrm{Myr}$, a value larger by a factor of two than the
timescale reported in a previous study.

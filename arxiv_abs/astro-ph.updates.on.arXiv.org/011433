Determining the architecture of multi-planetary systems is one of the cornerstones of understanding
planet formation and evolution. Resonant systems are especially important as the fragility of
their orbital configuration ensures that no significant scattering or collisional event has taken
place since the earliest formation phase when the parent protoplanetary disc was still present.
In this context, TOI-178 has been the subject of particular attention since the first TESS observations
hinted at a 2:3:3 resonant chain. Here we report the results of observations from CHEOPS, ESPRESSO,
NGTS, and SPECULOOS with the aim of deciphering the peculiar orbital architecture of the system.
We show that TOI-178 harbours at least six planets in the super-Earth to mini-Neptune regimes, with
radii ranging from 1.152(-0.070/+0.073) to 2.87(-0.13/+0.14) Earth radii and periods of 1.91,
3.24, 6.56, 9.96, 15.23, and 20.71 days. All planets but the innermost one form a 2:4:6:9:12 chain
of Laplace resonances, and the planetary densities show important variations from planet to planet,
jumping from 1.02(+0.28/-0.23) to 0.177(+0.055/-0.061) times the Earth's density between planets
c and d. Using Bayesian interior structure retrieval models, we show that the amount of gas in the
planets does not vary in a monotonous way, contrary to what one would expect from simple formation
and evolution models and unlike other known systems in a chain of Laplace resonances. The brightness
of TOI-178 allows for a precise characterisation of its orbital architecture as well as of the physical
nature of the six presently known transiting planets it harbours. The peculiar orbital configuration
and the diversity in average density among the planets in the system will enable the study of interior
planetary structures and atmospheric evolution, providing important clues on the formation of
super-Earths and mini-Neptunes.

We present a high-resolution (R=140,000) spectrum of the bright quasar HE0001-2340 (z=2.26),
obtained with ESPRESSO at the Very Large Telescope. We analyse three systems at z=0.45, z=1.65,
and z=2.19 using multiple-component Voigt-profile fitting. We also compare our spectrum with
those obtained with VLT/UVES, covering a total period of 17 years. We disentangle turbulent and
thermal broadening in many components spread over about 400 km/s in the z~2.19 sub-DLA system. We
derive an average temperature of 16000+/-1300 K, i.e., about twice the canonical value of the warm
neutral medium in the Galactic interstellar medium. A comparison with other high-z, low-metallicity
absorbers reveals an anti-correlation between gas temperature and total HI column density. Although
requiring confirmation, this could be the first observational evidence of a thermal decrease with
galacto-centric distance, i.e., we may be witnessing a thermal transition between the circum-galactic
medium and the cooler ISM. We revisit the Mg isotopic ratios at z=0.45 and z=1.65 and constrain them
to be xi = (26Mg+25Mg)/24Mg <0.6 and <1.4 in these two systems, respectively. These values are consistent
with the standard Solar ratio, i.e., we do not confirm strong enhancement of heavy isotopes previously
inferred from UVES data. Finally, we confirm the partial coverage of the quasar emission-line region
by a FeI-bearing cloud in the z=0.45 system and present evidence for velocity sub-structure of the
gas that has Doppler parameters of the order of only ~0.3 km/s. This work demonstrates the uniqueness
of high-fidelity, high-resolution optical spectrographs on large telescopes as tools to investigate
the thermal state of the gas in and around galaxies as well as its spatial and velocity structure on
small scales, and to constrain the associated stellar nucleosynthetic history. [abridged]

Accretion discs around black holes can become warped by Lense-Thirring precession if the disc is
tilted with respect to the black hole spin vector. When the disc viscosity is sufficiently large
that warp propagation is diffusive, the inner disc can align with the black hole spin. However, if
the viscosity is small, such that the warp propagates as a wave, then steady-state solutions to the
linearised fluid equations exhibit an oscillatory radial profile of the disc tilt angle close to
the black hole. Here we show, for the first time, that these solutions are in good agreement with three-dimensional
hydrodynamical simulations, in which the viscosity is isotropic and measured to be small compared
to the disc angular semi-thickness, and in the case that the disc tilt -- and thus the warp amplitude
-- remains small. We show using both the linearised fluid equations and hydrodynamical simulations
that the inner disc tilt can be more than several times larger than the original disc tilt, and we provide
physical reasoning for this effect. We explore the transition in disc behaviour as the misalignment
angle is increased, finding increased dissipation associated with regions of strong warping.
For large enough misalignments the disc becomes unstable to disc tearing and breaks into discrete
planes. For the simulations we present here, we show that the total (physical and numerical) viscosity
at the time the disc breaks is small enough that the disc tearing occurs in the wave-like regime, substantiating
that disc tearing is possible in this region of parameter space. Our simulations demonstrate that
high spatial resolution, and thus low numerical viscosity, is required to accurately model the
warp dynamics in this regime. Finally, we discuss the observational implications of our results.

CH2 transitions between 68 and 71 GHz were first detected toward the Orion-KL and W51 Main SFRs. Given
their upper level energies of 225 K, they were thought to arise in dense, hot molecular cores near
newly formed stars. However, this has not been confirmed by further observations of these lines
and their origin has remained unclear. Generally, there is a scarcity of observational data for
CH2 and, while it is an important compound in the astrochemical context, its actual occurrence in
astronomical sources is poorly constrained. The present study, along with other recent observations
of the Orion region we report, rule out the possibility of an association with gas that is both hot
and dense. We find that the distribution of the CH2 emission closely follows that of the [CII] 158
um emission, while CH2 is undetected toward the hot core itself. The observations suggest, rather,
that its extended emission arises from hot but dilute layers of PDRs and not from the denser parts
of such regions as in the case of the Orion Bar. This hypothesis was corroborated by comparisons of
the observed CH2 line profiles with those of CRRLs, well-known PDR tracers. In addition, we report
the detection of the 70 GHz fine- and hfs lines of o-CH2 toward the W51E, W51M, W51N, W49N, W43, W75N,
DR21, and S140 SFRs, and three of the fine- and hfs lines between 68-71 GHz toward W3 IRS5. Furthermore,
using a non-LTE radiative transfer analysis, we can constrain the gas temperatures and H2 density
to 163 K and 3.4e3 cm^-3, respectively. This analysis confirms our hypothesis that CH2 originates
in warm and dilute PDR layers. Our analysis suggests that for the excitation conditions under the
physical conditions that prevail in such regions, these lines are masering, with weak level inversion.
The resulting amplification of the lines' spontaneous emission greatly aids in their detection.

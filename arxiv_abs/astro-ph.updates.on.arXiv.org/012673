We study Population III (Pop III) binary remnant mergers in nuclear star clusters (NSCs) with a semi-analytical
approach for early structure formation based on halo merger trees, in which star formation and stellar
feedback are modelled self-consistently. Within this framework, we keep track of the dynamics
of Pop III binary (compact object) remnants in their host galaxies during cosmic structure formation,
and construct the population of Pop III binary remnants that fall into NSCs by dynamical friction
of field stars. The subsequent evolution within NSCs is then derived from three-body encounters
and gravitational-wave (GW) emission. We find that on average 7.5% of Pop III binary remnants will
fall into the centres ($< 3\ \rm pc$) of galaxies that can host NSCs with masses above $10^{5}\ \rm
M_{\odot}$. About $5-50$% of these binaries will merge at $z>0$ in NSCs, including those with very
large initial separations (up to 1~pc). The merger rate density (MRD) peaks at $z\sim 5-7$ with $\sim
0.4-10\ \rm yr^{-1}\ \rm Gpc^{-3}$, comparable to the MRDs found in the binary stellar evolution
channel. Low-mass ($\lesssim 10^{6}\ \rm M_{\odot}$) NSCs formed at high redshifts ($z\gtrsim
4.5$) host most ($\gtrsim 90$%) of our mergers, which mainly consist of black holes (BHs) with masses
$\sim 40-85\ \rm M_{\odot}$, similar to the most massive BHs found in LIGO events. Particularly,
our model can produce events like GW190521 involving BHs in the standard mass gap for pulsational
pair-instability supernovae with a MRD $\sim 0.01-0.09\ \rm yr^{-1}\ Gpc^{-3}$ at $z\sim 1$, consistent
with that inferred by LIGO (within the 90% confidence interval). We predict a promising detection
rate $\sim 170-2700\ \rm yr^{-1}$ for planned 3rd-generation GW detectors such as the Einstein
Telescope that can reach $z\sim 10$.

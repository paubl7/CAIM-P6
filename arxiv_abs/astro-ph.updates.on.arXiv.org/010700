We study the nature of energy release and transfer for two sub-A class solar microflares observed
during the second flight of the Focusing Optics X-ray Solar Imager (FOXSI-2) sounding rocket experiment
on 2014 December 11. FOXSI is the first solar-dedicated instrument to utilize focusing optics to
image the Sun in the hard X-ray (HXR) regime, sensitive to the energy range 4-20 keV. Through spectral
analysis of the two microflares using an optically thin isothermal plasma model, we find evidence
for plasma heated to temperatures of ~10 MK and emissions measures down to ~$10^{44}~$cm$^{-3}$.
Though nonthermal emission was not detected for the FOXSI-2 microflares, a study of the parameter
space for possible hidden nonthermal components shows that there could be enough energy in nonthermal
electrons to account for the thermal energy in microflare 1, indicating that this flare is plausibly
consistent with the standard thick-target model. With a solar-optimized design and improvements
in HXR focusing optics, FOXSI-2 offers approximately five times greater sensitivity at 10 keV than
the Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) for typical microflare observations and allows
for the first direct imaging spectroscopy of solar HXRs with an angular resolution at scales relevant
for microflares. Harnessing these improved capabilities to study the evolution of small-scale
events, we find evidence for spatial and temporal complexity during a sub-A class flare. These studies
in combination with contemporanous observations by the Atmospheric Imaging Assembly onboard
the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO/AIA) indicate that the evolution of these small microflares
is more similar to that of large flares than to the single burst of energy expected for a nanoflare.

We propose a novel method to detect cosmic magnification signals by cross-correlating foreground
convergence fields constructed from galaxy shear measurements with background galaxy positional
distributions, namely shear-number density correlation. We apply it to the Hyper Suprime-Cam
Subaru Strategic Program (HSC-SSP) survey data. With 27 non-independent data points and their
full covariance, $\chi_0^2\approx 34.1$ and $\chi_T^2\approx 24.0$ with respect to the null and
the cosmological model with the parameters from HSC shear correlation analyses in Hamana et al.
2020 (arXiv:1906.06041), respectively. The Bayes factor of the two is $\log_{10}B_{T0}\approx
2.2$ assuming equal model probabilities of null and HSC cosmology, showing a clear detection of
the magnification signals. Theoretically, the ratio of the shear-number density and shear-shear
correlations can provide a constraint on the effective multiplicative shear bias $\bar m$ using
internal data themselves. We demonstrate the idea with the signals from our HSC-SSP mock simulations
and rescaling the statistical uncertainties to a survey of $15000\deg^2$. For two-bin analyses
with background galaxies brighter than $m_{lim}=23$, the combined analyses lead to a forecasted
constraint of $\sigma(\bar m) \sim 0.032$, $2.3$ times tighter than that of using the shear-shear
correlation alone. Correspondingly, $\sigma(S_8)$ with $S_8=\sigma_8(\Omega_\mathrm{m}/0.3)^{0.5}$
is tightened by $\sim 2.1$ times. Importantly, the joint constraint on $\bar m$ is nearly independent
of cosmological parameters. Our studies therefore point to the importance of including the shear-number
density correlation in weak lensing analyses, which can provide valuable consistency tests of
observational data, and thus to solidify the derived cosmological constraints.

Circumstellar discs are essential for high mass star formation, while multiplicity, in particular
binarity, appears to be an inevitable outcome since the vast majority of massive stars (> 8 Msun)
are found in binaries (up to 100%). We constrain the sizes of the dust and ionised gas (Brgamma) emission
of the innermost regions towards a sample of six MYSOs, and provide high-mass binary statistics
of young stars at 2-300 au scales using VLTI (GRAVITY, AMBER) observations. We determine the inner
radius of the dust emission and place MYSOs with K-band measurements in a size-luminosity diagram
for the first time, and compare our findings to T Tauris and Herbig AeBes. We also compare the observed
K-band sizes to the sublimation radius predicted by three different disc scenarios. Lastly, we
apply binary geometries to trace close binarity among MYSOs. The inner sizes of MYSOs, Herbig AeBe
and T Tauri stars appear to follow a universal trend at which the sizes scale with the square-root
of the stellar luminosity. The Brgamma emission originates from somewhat smaller and co-planar
area compared to the 2.2 {\mu}m continuum emission. We discuss this new finding with respect to disc-wind
or jet origin. Finally, we report an MYSO binary fraction of 17-25% at milli-arcsecond separations
(2-300 au). The size-luminosity diagram indicates that the inner regions of discs around young
stars scale with luminosity independently of the stellar mass. At the targeted scales (2-300 au),
the MYSO binary fraction is lower than what was previously reported for the more evolved main sequence
massive stars, which, if further confirmed, could implicate the predictions from massive binary
formation theories. Lastly, we spatially resolve the crucial star/disc interface in a sample of
MYSOs, showing that au-scale discs are prominent in high-mass star formation and similar to their
low-mass equivalents.

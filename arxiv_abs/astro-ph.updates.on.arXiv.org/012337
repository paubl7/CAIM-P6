We investigate the nuclear pasta phases in neutron star crusts by conducting a large number of three-dimensional
Hartree-Fock+BCS calculations at densities leading to the crust-core transition. We survey the
shape parameter space of pasta at constant pressure. Spaghetti, waffles, lasagna, bi-continuous
phases and cylindrical holes occupy local minima in the resulting Gibbs energy surfaces. The bi-continuous
phase, in which both the neutron gas and nuclear matter extend continuously in all dimensions and
therefore protons are delocalized, appears over a large range of depths. Our results support the
idea that nuclear pasta is a glassy system. Multiple pasta configurations coexist in a given layer
of the crust. At a characteristic temperature, of order $10^8$-$10^9$K, different phases become
frozen into domains whose sizes we estimate to be 1-50 times the lattice spacing and over which the
local density and electron fraction can vary. Above this temperature, there is very little long-range
order and matter is an amorphous solid. Electron scattering off domain boundaries may contribute
to the disorder resistivity of the pasta phases. Annealing of the domains may occur during cooling;
repopulating of local minima during crustal heating might lead to temperature dependent transport
properties in the deep layers of the crust. We identify 4 distinct regions: (1) nuclear pasta first
appears as a local minima, but spherical nuclei are the ground state; (2) nuclear pasta become the
absolute minimum, but spherical nuclei are still a local minimum (3) only nuclear pasta appears
in local minima, and protons are still localized in at least one dimension (4) only pasta appears,
and protons are delocalized. The whole pasta region can occupy up to 70% of the crust by mass and 40%
by thickness, and the layer in which protons are delocalized could occupy 45% of the crust mass and
25% of its thickness.

Normal mode oscillations in Saturn excite density and bending waves in the C Ring, providing a valuable
window into the planet's interior. Saturn's fundamental modes (f modes) excite the majority of
the observed waves, while gravito-inertial modes (rotationally modified g modes) associated
with stable stratification in the deep interior provide a compelling explanation for additional
density waves with low azimuthal wavenumbers m. However, multiplets of density waves with nearly
degenerate frequencies, including an m=3 triplet, still lack a definitive explanation. We investigate
the effects of rapid and differential rotation on Saturn's oscillations, calculating normal modes
for independently constrained interior models. We use a non-perturbative treatment of rotation
that captures the full effects of the Coriolis and centrifugal forces, and consequently the mixing
of sectoral f modes with g modes characterized by very different spherical harmonic degrees. Realistic
profiles for differential rotation associated with Saturn's zonal winds can enhance these mode
interactions, producing detectable oscillations with frequencies separated by less than 1%.
Our calculations demonstrate that a three-mode interaction involving an f mode and two g modes can
feasibly explain the finely split m=3 triplet, although the fine-tuning required to produce such
an interaction generally worsens agreement with seismological constraints provided by m=2 density
waves. Our calculations additionally demonstrate that sectoral f mode frequencies are measurably
sensitive to differential rotation in Saturn's convective envelope. Finally, we find that including
realistic equatorial antisymmetry in Saturn's differential rotation profile couples modes with
even and odd equatorial parity, producing oscillations that could in principle excite both density
and bending waves simultaneously.

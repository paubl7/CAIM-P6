We present an extensive catalog of non-parametric structural properties derived from optical
and mid-infrared imaging for 4585 galaxies from the MaNGA survey. DESI and WISE imaging are used
to extract surface brightness profiles in the g, r, z, W1, W2 photometric bands. Our optical photometry
takes advantage of the automated algorithm AutoProf and probes surface brightnesses that typically
reach below 29 mag/arcsec^2 in the r-band, while our WISE photometry achieves 28 mag/arcsec^2 in
the W1-band. Neighbour density measures and central/satellite classifications are also provided
for a large sub-sample of the MaNGA galaxies. Highlights of our analysis of galaxy light profiles
include: (i) an extensive comparison of galaxian structural properties that illustrates the robustness
of non-parametric extraction of light profiles over parametric methods; (ii) the ubiquity of bimodal
structural properties suggesting the existence of galaxy families in multiple dimensions; and,
(iii) an appreciation that structural properties measured relative to total light are uncertain.
We study galaxy scaling relations based on photometric parameters, and present detailed comparisons
with the literature and theoretical expectations. Salient features of this analysis include the
near-constancy of the slope and scatter of the size-luminosity and size-stellar mass relations
for late-type galaxies with wavelength, and the saturation of the central surface density, measured
within 1 kpc, for elliptical galaxies with M* > 10.7 Msol (corresponding to Sigma_1 ~ 10^{10} Msol/kpc^2).
The multi-band photometry, environmental parameters, and structural scaling relations presented
here are useful constraints for stellar population and galaxy formation models.

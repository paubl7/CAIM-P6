Context. Extra-tidal stars are those that lie outside the tidal radius of a cluster due to internal
processes or external forces acting on it. The presence and spatial distribution of these stars
can give us insights into the past evolution of a cluster inside our Galaxy. Aims. Previous works
suggest that globular clusters, when explored in detail, show evidence of extra-tidal stars. We
aim to search for possible extra-tidal stars in the Galactic globular clusters NGC 6397, NGC 2808
and NGC 6266 using the photometry and proper motion measurements from Gaia DR2 database (Gaia Collaboration
et al. 2018). Results. 120, 126 and 107 extra-tidal candidate stars were found lying outside the
tidal radius of the globular clusters NGC 6397, NGC 2808 and NGC 6266, respectively. 70%, 25.4% and
72.9% of the extra-tidal stars found are located outside the Jacobi radius of NGC 6397, NGC 2808 and
NGC 6266, respectively. The spatial distribution of the extra-tidal stars belonging to NGC 6397
appears S-like, extending in curved leading and trailing arms. NGC 2808 has an overdensity of stars
in the trailing part of the cluster and NGC 6266 seems to have overdensities of extra-tidal stars
in its eastern and northern sides. Conclusions. Proper motions and color-magnitude diagrams can
be used to identify extra-tidal candidate stars around GCs. Nonetheless, depending on how different
the kinematics and stellar populations of a cluster are compared to the Milky Way field, the fraction
of contamination can be larger. All the three clusters have extra-tidal stars outside their tidal
radius. For NGC 6397 and NGC 2808 these stars may be a result of a combined effect of the disc shocks
and tidal disruptions. For NGC 6266, the distribution of extra-tidal stars is symmetrical around
it, most likely indicating that the cluster has an extended stellar envelope.

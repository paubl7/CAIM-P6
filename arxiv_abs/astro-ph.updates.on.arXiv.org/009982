We conduct a rigorous examination of the nearby red supergiant Betelgeuse by drawing on the synthesis
of new observational data and three different modeling techniques. Our observational results
include the release of new, processed photometric measurements collected with the space-based
SMEI instrument prior to Betelgeuse's recent, unprecedented dimming event. We detect the first
radial overtone in the photometric data and report a period of $185\pm13.5$ d. Our theoretical predictions
include self-consistent results from multi-timescale evolutionary, oscillatory, and hydrodynamic
simulations conducted with the Modules for Experiments in Stellar Astrophysics (MESA) software
suite. Significant outcomes of our modeling efforts include a precise prediction for the star's
radius: $764^{+116}_{-62} R_{\odot}$. In concert with additional constraints, this allows us
to derive a new, independent distance estimate of $168^ {+27}_{-15}$ pc and a parallax of $\pi=5.95^{+0.58}_{-0.85}$
mas, in good agreement with Hipparcos but less so with recent radio measurements. Seismic results
from both perturbed hydrostatic and evolving hydrodynamic simulations constrain the period and
driving mechanisms of Betelgeuse's dominant periodicities in new ways. Our analyses converge
to the conclusion that Betelgeuse's $\approx 400$ day period is the result of pulsation in the fundamental
mode, driven by the $\kappa$-mechanism. Grid-based hydrodynamic modeling reveals that the behavior
of the oscillating envelope is mass-dependent, and likewise suggests that the non-linear pulsation
excitation time could serve as a mass constraint. Our results place $\alpha$ Ori definitively in
the core helium-burning phase near the base of the red supergiant branch. We report a present-day
mass of $16.5$--$19 ~M_{\odot}$---slightly lower than typical literature values.

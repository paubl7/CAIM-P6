Context: The formation of high-mass star-forming regions from their parental gas cloud and the
subsequent fragmentation processes lie at the heart of star formation research. Aims: We aim to
study the dynamical and fragmentation properties at very early evolutionary stages of high-mass
star formation. Methods: Employing the NOrthern Extended Millimeter Array (NOEMA) and the IRAM
30m telescope, we observed two young high-mass star-forming regions, ISOSS22478 and ISOSS23053,
in the 1.3mm continuum and spectral line emission at a high angular resolution (~0.8''). Results:
We resolved 29 cores that are mostly located along filament-like structures. Depending on the temperature
assumption, these cores follow a mass-size relation of approximately M~r^2.0, corresponding
to constant mean column densities. However, with different temperature assumptions, a steeper
mass-size relation up to M~r^3.0, which would be more likely to correspond to constant mean volume
densities, cannot be ruled out. The correlation of the core masses with their nearest neighbor separations
is consistent with thermal Jeans fragmentation. We found hardly any core separations at the spatial
resolution limit, indicating that the data resolve the large-scale fragmentation well. Although
the kinematics of the two regions appear very different at first sight - multiple velocity components
along filaments in ISOSS22478 versus a steep velocity gradient of more than 50km/s/pc in ISOSS23053
- the findings can be explained within the framework of a dynamical cloud collapse scenario. Conclusions:
While our data are consistent with a dynamical cloud collapse scenario and subsequent thermal Jeans
fragmentation, the importance of additional environmental properties, such as the magnetization
of the gas or external shocks triggering converging gas flows, is nonetheless not as well constrained
and would require future investigation.

(shortened) Planet forming discs are believed to be very weakly turbulent in the regions outside
of 1 AU. For this reason, it is now believed that magnetized winds could be the dominant mechanism
driving accretion in these systems. However, there is today no self-consistent way to describe
discs subject to a magnetized wind, in a way similar to the $\alpha$ disc model. In this article, I
explore in a systematic way the parameter space of wind-driven protoplanetary discs and present
scaling laws which can be used in reduced models \`a la alpha-disc. Methods: I compute a series of
self-similar wind solutions, assuming the disc is dominated by ambipolar and Ohmic diffusions.
These solution are obtained by looking for stationary solutions in the finite-volume code PLUTO
using a relaxation method and continuation. Results: Self-similar solutions are obtained for
values of plasma beta ranging from 10^2 to 10^8, for several Ohmic and ambipolar diffusion strengths.
Mass accretions rates of the order of 10^{-8} Msun/yr are obtained for poloidal field strength beta=O(10^4)
or equivalently 1 mG at 10 AU. The resulting magnetic lever arms are typically lower than 2, possibly
reaching 1.5 in weakest field cases. Finally, I provide a complete set of scaling laws and semi-analytical
wind solutions, which can be used to fit and interpret observations. Conclusions: Magnetized winds
are unavoidable in protoplanetary discs as soon as they are embedded in an ambient poloidal magnetic
field. Very detailed disc microphysics are not always needed to describe them, and simplified models
such as self-similar solutions manage to capture most of the physics seen in full 3D simulations.
The remaining difficulty to get a complete theory of wind-driven accretion lies in the transport
of the large scale field, which remains poorly constrained and not well understood.

Vacuum-UV (VUV) photodesorption from water-rich ice mantles coating interstellar grains is known
to play an important role in the gas-to-ice ratio in star- and planet-forming regions. Quantitative
photodesorption yields from water ice are crucial for astrochemical models. We aim to provide the
first quantitative photon-energy dependent photodesorption yields from water ice in the VUV.
This information is important to understand the photodesorption mechanisms and to account for
the variation of the yields under interstellar irradiation conditions. Experiments have been
performed on the DESIRS beamline at the SOLEIL synchrotron, delivering tunable VUV light, using
the SPICES (Surface Processes and ICES) set-up. Compact amorphous solid water ice (H$_2$O and D$_2$O)
has been irradiated from 7 to 13.5 eV. Quantitative yields have been obtained by detection in the
gas phase with mass-spectrometry for sample temperatures ranging from 15 K to 100 K. Photodesorption
spectra of H$_2$O (D$_2$O), OH (OD), H$_2$ (D$_2$) and O$_2$ peak around 9-10 eV and decrease at higher
energies. Average photodesorption yields of intact water at 15 K are 5 $\times$ 10$^{-4}$ molecule/photon
for H$_2$O and 5 $\times$ 10$^{-5}$ molecule/photon for D$_2$O over the 7-13.5 eV range. The strong
isotopic effect can be explained by a differential chemical recombination between OH (OD) and H
(D) photofragments originating from lower kinetic energy available for the OH photofragments
upon direct water photodissociation and/or possibly by an electronic relaxation process. It is
expected to contribute to water fractionation during the building-up of the ice grain mantles in
molecular clouds and to favor OH-poor chemical environment in comet-formation regions of protoplanetary
disks. The yields of all the detected species except OH (OD) are enhanced above (70 $\pm$10) K, suggesting
an ice restructuration at this temperature.

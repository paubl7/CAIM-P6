In this study we extract the deep features and investigate the compression of the Mg II k spectral
line profiles observed in quiet Sun regions by NASA's IRIS satellite. The data set of line profiles
used for the analysis was obtained on April 20th, 2020, at the center of the solar disc, and contains
almost 300,000 individual Mg II k line profiles after data cleaning. The data are separated into
train and test subsets. The train subset was used to train the autoencoder of the varying embedding
layer size. The early stopping criterion was implemented on the test subset to prevent the model
from overfitting. Our results indicate that it is possible to compress the spectral line profiles
more than 27 times (which corresponds to the reduction of the data dimensionality from 110 to 4) while
having a 4 DN average reconstruction error, which is comparable to the variations in the line continuum.
The mean squared error and the reconstruction error of even statistical moments sharply decrease
when the dimensionality of the embedding layer increases from 1 to 4 and almost stop decreasing for
higher numbers. The observed occasional improvements in training for values higher than 4 indicate
that a better compact embedding may potentially be obtained if other training strategies and longer
training times are used. The features learned for the critical four-dimensional case can be interpreted.
In particular, three of these four features mainly control the line width, line asymmetry, and line
dip formation respectively. The presented results are the first attempt to obtain a compact embedding
for spectroscopic line profiles and confirm the value of this approach, in particular for feature
extraction, data compression, and denoising.

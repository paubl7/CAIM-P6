Solar-type stars exhibit their highest levels of magnetic activity during their early convective
pre-main sequence (PMS) phase of evolution. The most powerful PMS flares, super-flares and mega-flares,
have peak X-ray luminosities of $\log(L_X)=30.5-34.0$~erg~s$^{-1}$ and total energies $\log(E_X)=34-38$~erg.
Among $>24,000$ X-ray selected young ($t<5$~Myr) members of 40 nearby star-forming regions from
our earlier $Chandra$ MYStIX and SFiNCs surveys, we identify and analyze a well-defined sample
of 1,086 X-ray super-flares and mega-flares, the largest sample ever studied. Most are considerably
more powerful than optical/X-ray super-flares detected on main sequence stars. This study presents
energy estimates of these X-ray flares and the properties of their host stars. These events are produced
by young stars of all masses over evolutionary stages ranging from protostars to diskless stars,
with the occurrence rate positively correlated with stellar mass. Flare properties are indistinguishable
for disk-bearing and diskless stars indicating star-disk magnetic fields are not involved. A slope
$\alpha\simeq2$ in the flare energy distributions $dN/dE_X \propto E_X^{-\alpha}$ is consistent
with those of optical/X-ray flaring from older stars and the Sun. Mega-flares ($\log(E_X) > 36.2$~erg)
from solar-mass stars have occurrence rate of $1.7_{-0.6}^{+1.0}$ flares/star/year and contribute
at least $10-20$\% to the total PMS X-ray energetics. These explosive events may have important
astrophysical effects on protoplanetary disk photoevaporation, ionization of disk gas, production
of spallogenic radionuclides in disk solids, and hydrodynamic escape of young planetary atmospheres.
Our following paper details plasma and magnetic loop modeling of the $>50$ brightest X-ray mega-flares.

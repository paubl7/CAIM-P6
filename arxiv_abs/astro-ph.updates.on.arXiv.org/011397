Stellar halos in early-type galaxies (ETGs) are shaped by their accretion and merger histories.
We use a sample of 1114 ETGs in the TNG100 simulation with stellar masses $10^{10.3}\leq M_{*}/M_\odot\leq
10^{12}$, selected at z=0 within the range of g-r colour and lambda-ellipticity diagram populated
by observed ETGs. We study how the rotational support and intrinsic shapes of the stellar halos depend
on the fraction of accreted stars, overall and separately by major, minor, and mini mergers. Accretion
histories in TNG100 ETGs as well as the radial distributions of ex-situ stars $f_{ex}(R)$ strongly
correlate with stellar mass. Low-mass ETGs have characteristic peaked rotation profiles and near-oblate
shapes with rounder halos that are completely driven by the in-situ stars. At high $f_{ex}$ major
mergers decrease the in-situ peak in rotation velocity, flatten the $V_{*}/\sigma_{*}(R)$ profiles,
and increase the triaxiality of the stellar halos. Kinematic transition radii do not trace the transition
between in-situ and ex-situ dominated regions, but for systems with $M_{*}>10^{10.6}M_\odot$
the local rotational support decreases with the local ex-situ fraction $f_{ex}(R)$ and triaxiality
increases with $f_{ex}$. These correlations are followed by fast and slow rotators alike with a
continuous and overlapping sequence of properties. Merger events dynamically couple stars and
dark matter: in high mass ETGs and at large radii where $f_{ex}\gtrsim0.5$, both components tend
to have similar intrinsic shapes and rotational support, and nearly aligned principal axes and
spin directions. Based on these results we suggest that extended photometry and kinematics of massive
ETGs ($M_{*}>10^{10.6}M_\odot$) can be used to estimate the local fraction of ex-situ stars and
to approximate the intrinsic shapes and rotational support of the co-spatial dark matter component.

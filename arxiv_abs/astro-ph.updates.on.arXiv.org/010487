Planet formation is generally described in terms of a system containing the host star and a protoplanetary
disc, of which the internal properties (e.g. mass and metallicity) determine the properties of
the resulting planetary system. However, (proto)planetary systems are predicted and observed
to be affected by the spatially-clustered stellar formation environment, either through dynamical
star-star interactions or external photoevaporation by nearby massive stars. It is challenging
to quantify how the architecture of planetary systems is affected by these environmental processes,
because stellar groups spatially disperse within <1 billion years, well below the ages of most known
exoplanets. Here we identify old, co-moving stellar groups around exoplanet host stars in the astrometric
data from the Gaia satellite and demonstrate that the architecture of planetary systems exhibits
a strong dependence on local stellar clustering in position-velocity phase space, implying a dependence
on their formation or evolution environment. After controlling for host stellar age, mass, metallicity,
and distance from the Sun, we obtain highly significant differences (with $p$-values of $10^{-5}{-}10^{-2}$)
in planetary (system) properties between phase space overdensities and the field. The median semi-major
axis and orbital period of planets in overdensities are 0.087 au and 9.6 days, respectively, compared
to 0.81 au and 154 days for planets around field stars. 'Hot Jupiters' (massive, close-in planets)
predominantly exist in stellar phase space overdensities, strongly suggesting that their extreme
orbits originate from environmental perturbations rather than internal migration or planet-planet
scattering. Our findings reveal that stellar clustering is a key factor setting the architectures
of planetary systems.

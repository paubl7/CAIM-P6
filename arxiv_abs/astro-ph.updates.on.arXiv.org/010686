In solar flares, energy is released impulsively and is partly converted into thermal energy of hot
plasmas and kinetic energy of accelerated nonthermal particles. Despite numerous efforts, no
consensus on quantifying this energy balance has yet been reached. We aim to understand the reasons
for the contradicting results on energy partition obtained by various recent studies. We considered
five recent studies that address the thermal-nonthermal energy partition in solar flares. Their
results are reviewed, and their methods are compared and discussed in detail. The main uncertainties
in deriving the energy partition are identified as (a) the derivation of the differential emission
measure (DEM) distribution and (b) the role of the conductive energy loss for the thermal component,
as well as (c) the determination of the low-energy cutoff for the injected electrons. The bolometric
radiated energy, as a proxy for the total energy released in the flare, is a useful independent constraint
on both thermal and nonthermal energetics. In most of the cases, the derived energetics are consistent
with this constraint. There are indications that the thermal-nonthermal energy partition changes
with flare strength: in weak flares, there appears to be a deficit of energetic electrons, while
the injected nonthermal energy is sufficient to account for the thermal component in strong flares.
This behavior is identified as the main cause of the dissimilar results in the studies we considered.
The changing partition has two important consequences: (a) an additional direct (i.e. non-beam)
heating mechanism has to be present, and (b) considering that the bolometric emission originates
mainly from deeper atmospheric layers, conduction or waves are required as additional energy transport
mechanisms.

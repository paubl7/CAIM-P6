Phenomenological parameterization of the perturbed Einstein's equations have become an important
route to testing General Relativity (GR) at cosmological scales. This is often done by constraining
a pair of modified gravity (MG) parameters associated with the growth of matter, the propagation
of light, the gravitational slip, or the running of gravitational coupling. We explore here constraints
on one MG parameter at a time while fixing the other at its GR value. This allows one to analyze various
models while benefiting from a stronger constraining power from the data. We also explore which
specific datasets are in tension with GR. We find cases with stronger tension with GR than two-MG-parameter
approaches. For example, models with ($\mu=1$, $\eta$) and ($\mu$, $\eta=1$) exhibit a 3.86-$\sigma$
(or an Index of Inconsistency, IOI=7.45) and 3.77-$\sigma$ (IOI=7.11) departure from their GR
values when using Planck18+SNe+BAO data, while ($\mu$, $\eta$) shows a tension of 3.42-$\sigma$
(IOI=5.85). We find no tension with GR for models with the MG parameter $\Sigma$ fixed to its GR unity
value. Using a Bayesian model selection analysis, we find that some one-parameter MG models are
moderately favored over $\Lambda$CDM when using all dataset combinations except Planck CMB Lensing
and DES data. Namely, Planck18 shows a moderate tension with GR that only increases when adding any
combination of RSD, SNe, or BAO. However, adding Planck CMB Lensing or DES data respectively diminishes
or removes these tensions, which can be attributed to the ability of lensing in constraining the
MG parameter $\Sigma$. The two overall groups of datasets are found to have a dichotomy when performing
consistency tests with GR, which may be due to systematic effects, lack of constraining power, or
modelling. These findings warrant further investigation using more precise data from ongoing
and future surveys.

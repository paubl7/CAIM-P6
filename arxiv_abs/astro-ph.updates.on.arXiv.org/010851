New observations of high-redshift objects are crucial for the improvement of the standard $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model and our understanding of the Universe. One of the main directions of modern observational
cosmology is the analysis of the large-scale structure of Universe, in particular, in deep fields.
We study the large-scale structure of the Universe along the line of sight using the latest version
of the COSMOS2015 catalogue, which contains 518,404 high quality photometric redshifts of galaxies
selected in the optical range of the COSMOS field ($2\times 2$ deg$^2$), with depth up to the redshift
$z \sim 6$. We analyze large-scale fluctuations in the number of galaxies along the line of sight
and provide an estimate of the average linear sizes of the self-correlating fluctuations (structures)
in independent redshift bins of $ \Delta z = 0.1 $ along with the estimate of the standard deviation
from homogeneity (the observed cosmic variance). We suggest a new method of the line-of-sight analysis
based on previous works and formulate further prospects of method development. For the case of the
theoretical form of approximation of homogeneity in the $\Lambda$CDM framework, the average standard
deviation of detected structures from homogeneity is $ \sigma_\text{mean}^{\Lambda \text{CDM}}
= 0.09 \pm 0.02 $, and the average characteristic size of structures is $ R_\text{mean}^{\Lambda
\text{CDM}} = 790 \pm 150 $ Mpc. For the case of the empirical approximation of homogeneity, the average
standard deviation of detected structures from homogeneity is $ \sigma_\text{mean}^\text{empiric}
= 0.08 \pm 0.01 $, and the average characteristic size of structures is $ R_\text{mean}^\text{empiric}
= 640 \pm 140 $ Mpc.

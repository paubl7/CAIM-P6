We aim to study the progenitor properties and expected rates of the two lowest-mass binary black
hole (BH) mergers, GW 151226 and GW 170608, detected within the first two Advanced LIGO-Virgo runs,
in the context of the isolated binary-evolution scenario. We use the public MESA code, which we adapted
to include BH formation and unstable mass transfer developed during a common-envelope (CE) phase.
Using more than 60000 binary simulations, we explore a wide parameter space for initial stellar
masses, separations, metallicities, and mass-transfer efficiencies. We obtain the expected
distributions for the chirp mass, mass ratio, and merger time delay by accounting for the initial
stellar binary distributions. Our simulations show that, while the progenitors we obtain are compatible
over the entire range of explored metallicities, they show a strong dependence on the initial masses
of the stars, according to stellar winds. All the progenitors follow a similar evolutionary path,
starting from binaries with initial separations in the $30-200~R_\odot$ range, experiencing
a stable mass transfer interaction before the formation of the first BH, and a second unstable mass-transfer
episode leading to a CE ejection that occurs either when the secondary star crosses the Hertzsprung
gap or when it is burning He in its core. The CE phase plays a fundamental role in the considered low-mass
range: only progenitors experiencing such an unstable mass-transfer phase are able to merge in
less than a Hubble time. We find integrated merger-rate densities in the range $0.2-5.0~{\rm yr}^{-1}~{\rm
Gpc}^{-3}$ in the local Universe for the highest mass-transfer efficiencies explored. The highest
rate densities lead to detection rates of $1.2-3.3~{\rm yr}^{-1}$, being compatible with the observed
rates. A high CE-efficiency scenario with $\alpha_{\rm CE}=2.0$ is favored when comparing with
observations. ABRIDGED.

We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging of a pre-explosion counterpart to SN 2019yvr obtained
2.6 years before its explosion as a type Ib supernova (SN Ib). Aligning to a post-explosion Gemini-S/GSAOI
image, we demonstrate that there is a single source consistent with being the SN 2019yvr progenitor
system, the second SN Ib progenitor candidate after iPTF13bvn. We also analyzed pre-explosion
Spitzer/IRAC imaging, but we do not detect any counterparts at the SN location. SN 2019yvr was highly
reddened, and comparing its spectra and photometry to those of other, less extinguished SNe Ib we
derive $E(B-V)=0.51\substack{+0.27\\-0.16}$ mag for SN 2019yvr. Correcting photometry of the
pre-explosion source for dust reddening, we determine that this source is consistent with a $\log(L/L_{\odot})
= 5.3 \pm 0.2$ and $T_{\mathrm{eff}} = 6800\substack{+400\\-200}$ K star. This relatively cool
photospheric temperature implies a radius of 320$\substack{+30\\-50} R_{\odot}$, much larger
than expectations for SN Ib progenitor stars with trace amounts of hydrogen but in agreement with
previously identified SN IIb progenitor systems. The photometry of the system is also consistent
with binary star models that undergo common envelope evolution, leading to a primary star hydrogen
envelope mass that is mostly depleted but seemingly in conflict with the SN Ib classification of
SN 2019yvr. SN 2019yvr had signatures of strong circumstellar interaction in late-time ($>$150
day) spectra and imaging, and so we consider eruptive mass loss and common envelope evolution scenarios
that explain the SN Ib spectroscopic class, pre-explosion counterpart, and dense circumstellar
material. We also hypothesize that the apparent inflation could be caused by a quasi-photosphere
formed in an extended, low-density envelope or circumstellar matter around the primary star.

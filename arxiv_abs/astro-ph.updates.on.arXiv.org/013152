The cyano radical (CN), one of the first detected interstellar molecular species, is a key molecule
in many astrochemical chains. Particularly, it is detected towards molecular cores, the birth
places of the stars, and it is known that it is involved in the rich chemistry that takes place in these
sites. At present there are not so many studies about the emission of this molecular species at small
spatial scales towards massive young stellar objects. Thus, we present a high-angular resolution
CN study towards a sample of massive protostars, with the aim of unveiling the spatial distribution
at the small scale of the emission of this radical in relation to the star-forming processes. The
interstellar CN has a strong emission line at the rest frequency 226874.764 MHz, thus, we search
for observing projects in the ALMA database regarding high-mass star-forming regions observed
at Band 6. A sample of ten high-mass star-forming regions were selected in base on that they present
a clear emission of CN at the mentioned frequency. We found that the CN traces both molecular condensations
and diffuse and extended gas surrounding them. In general, the molecular condensations traced
by the maximums of the CN emission do not spatially coincide with the peaks of the continuum emission
at 1.3 mm, which trace the molecular cores where the massive stars born. Based on the presence or lack
of near-IR emission associated with such cores, we suggest that our sample is composed by sources
at different stages of evolution. The CN is present at both, suggesting that this radical may be ubiquitous
along the different star formation stages, and hence it may be involved in different chemical reactions
occurring along the time in the formation of the stars. Additionally, other complex molecules were
detected towards the continuum peaks of some of the analyzed cores.

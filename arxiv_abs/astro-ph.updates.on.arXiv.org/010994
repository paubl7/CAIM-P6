We constrain cosmological parameters from a joint cosmic shear analysis of peak-counts and the
two-point shear correlation function, as measured from the Dark Energy Survey (DES-Y1). We find
the structure growth parameter $S_8\equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3} = 0.766^{+0.033}_{-0.038}$,
which at 4.8% precision, provides one of the tightest constraints on $S_8$ from the DES-Y1 weak lensing
data. In our simulation-based method we determine the expected DES-Y1 peak-count signal for a range
of cosmologies sampled in four $w$CDM parameters ($\Omega_{\rm m}$, $\sigma_8$, $h$, $w_0$).
We also determine the joint peak-correlation function covariance matrix with over 1000 realisations
at our fiducial cosmology. With mock DES-Y1 data we calibrate the impact of photometric redshift
and shear calibration uncertainty on the peak-count, marginalising over these uncertainties
in our cosmological analysis. Using dedicated training samples we show that our measurements are
unaffected by mass resolution limits in the simulation, and that our constraints are robust against
uncertainty in the effect of baryon feedback. Accurate modelling for the impact of intrinsic alignments
on the tomographic peak-count remains a challenge, currently limiting our exploitation of cross-correlated
peak counts between high and low redshift bins. We demonstrate that once calibrated, a fully tomographic
joint peak-count and correlation function analysis has the potential to reach a 3% precision on
$S_8$ for DES-Y1. Our methodology can be adopted to model any statistic that is sensitive to the non-Gaussian
information encoded in the shear field. In order to accelerate the development of these beyond-two-point
cosmic shear studies, our simulations are made available to the community, on request.

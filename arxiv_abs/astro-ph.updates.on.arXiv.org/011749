Revealing the mechanisms shaping the architecture of planetary systems is crucial for our understanding
of their formation and evolution. In this context, it has been recently proposed that stellar clustering
might be the key in shaping the orbital architecture of exoplanets. The main goal of this work is to
explore the factors that shape the orbits of planets. We used a homogeneous sample of relatively
young FGK dwarf stars with RV detected planets and tested the hypothesis that their association
to phase space (position-velocity) over-densities ('cluster' stars) and under-densities ('field'
stars) impacts the orbital periods of planets. When controlling for the host star properties, on
a sample of 52 planets orbiting around 'cluster' stars and 15 planets orbiting around 'field' star,
we found no significant difference in the period distribution of planets orbiting these two populations
of stars. By considering an extended sample of 73 planets orbiting around 'cluster' stars and 25
planets orbiting 'field' stars, a significant different in the planetary period distributions
emerged. However, the hosts associated to stellar under-densities appeared to be significantly
older than their 'cluster' counterparts. This did not allow us to conclude whether the planetary
architecture is related to age, environment, or both. We further studied a sample of planets orbiting
'cluster' stars to study the mechanism responsible for the shaping of orbits of planets in similar
environments. We could not identify a parameter that can unambiguously be responsible for the orbital
architecture of massive planets, perhaps, indicating the complexity of the issue. Conclusions.
Increased number of planets in clusters and in over-density environments will help to build large
and unbiased samples which will then allow to better understand the dominant processes shaping
the orbits of planets.

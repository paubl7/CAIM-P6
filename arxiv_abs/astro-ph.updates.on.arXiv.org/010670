Von Zeipel-Lidov-Kozai (ZLK) oscillations in hierarchical triple systems have important astrophysical
implications such as triggering strong interactions and producing, e.g., Type Ia supernovae and
gravitational wave sources. When considering analytic properties of ZLK oscillations at the lowest
(quadrupole) expansion order, as well as complications due to higher-order terms, one usually
assumes the test particle limit, in which one of the bodies in the inner binary is massless. Although
this approximation holds well for, e.g., planetary systems, it is less accurate for systems with
more comparable masses such as stellar triples. Whereas non-test-particle effects are usually
taken into account in numerical simulations, a more analytic approach focusing on the differences
between the test particle and general case (at quadrupole order) has, to our knowledge, not been
presented. Here, we derive several analytic properties of secular oscillations in triples at the
quadruple expansion order. The latter applies even to relatively compact triples, as long as the
inner bodies are similar in mass such that octupole-order effects are suppressed. We consider general
conditions for the character of the oscillations (circular versus librating), minimum and maximum
eccentricities, and timescales, all as a function of $\gamma \equiv (1/2) L_1/G_2$, a ratio of inner-to-outer
orbital angular momenta variables ($\gamma=0$ in the test particle limit). In particular, eccentricity
oscillations are more effective at retrograde orientations for non-zero $\gamma$; assuming zero
initial inner eccentricity, the maximum eccentricity peaks at $\cos(i_\mathrm{rel,0}) = -\gamma$,
where $i_\mathrm{rel,0}$ is the initial relative inclination. We provide a Python script which
can be used to quickly compute these properties.

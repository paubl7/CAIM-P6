Aims: To investigate properties of [CII]158 $\mu$m emission of RCW36 in a dense filamentary cloud.
Methods: [CII] observations of RCW36 covering an area of ~30 arcmin$\times$30 arcmin were carried
out with a Fabry-P\'{e}rot spectrometer aboard a 100-cm balloon-borne far-infrared (IR) telescope
with an angular resolution of 90 arcsec. By using AKARI and Herschel images, the spatial distribution
of the [CII] intensity was compared with those of emission from the large grains and PAH. Results:
The [CII] emission is spatially in good agreement with shell-like structures of a bipolar lobe observed
in IR images, which extend along the direction perpendicular to the direction of a cold dense filament.
We found that the [CII]--160 $\mu$m relation for RCW36 shows higher brightness ratio of [CII]/160
$\mu$m than that for RCW 38, while the [CII]--9 $\mu$m relation for RCW36 is in good agreement with
that for RCW38. Conclusions: The [CII] emission spatially well correlates with PAH and cold dust
emissions. This means that the observed [CII] emission dominantly comes from PDRs. Moreover, the
L_[CII]/L_FIR ratio shows large variation compared with the L_[CII]/L_PAH ratio. In view of the
observed tight correlation between L_[CII]/L_FIR and the optical depth at $\lambda$=160 $\mu$m,
the large variation in L_[CII]/L_FIR can be simply explained by the geometrical effect, viz., L_FIR
has contributions from the entire dust-cloud column along the line of sight, while L_[CII] has contributions
from far-UV illuminated cloud surfaces. Based on the picture of the geometry effect, the enhanced
brightness ratio of [CII]/160 $\mu$m is attributed to the difference in gas structures where massive
stars are formed: filamentary (RCW36) and clumpy (RCW38) molecular clouds and thus suggests that
RCW36 is dominated by far-UV illuminated cloud surfaces compared with RCW38.

Particle acceleration in magnetized relativistic jets still puzzles theorists, specially when
one tries to explain the highly variable emission observed in blazar jets or gamma-ray bursts putting
severe constraints on current models. In this work we investigate the acceleration of particles
injected in a three-dimensional relativistic magnetohydrodynamical jet subject to current driven
kink instability (CDKI), which drives turbulence and fast magnetic reconnection. Test protons
injected in the nearly stationary snapshots of the jet, experience an exponential acceleration
up to a maximum energy. For a background magnetic field of $B \sim 0.1$ G, this saturation energy is
$\sim 10^{16}$ eV, while for $B \sim 10$ G it is $\sim 10^{18}$ eV. The simulations also reveal a clear
association of the accelerated particles with the regions of fast reconnection. In the early stages
of the development of the non-linear growth of CDKI in the jet, when there are still no sites of fast
reconnection, injected particles are also efficiently accelerated, but by magnetic curvature
drift in the wiggling jet spine. However, they have to be injected with an initial energy much larger
than that required for particles to accelerate in reconnection sites. Finally, we have also obtained
from the simulations an acceleration time due to reconnection with a weak dependence on the particles
energy $E$, $t_A \propto E^{0.1}$. The energy spectrum of the accelerated particles develops a
high energy tail with a power law index $p \sim$ -1.2 in the beginning of the acceleration, in agreement
with earlier works. Our results provide an appropriate multi-dimensional framework for exploring
this process in real systems and explain their complex emission patterns, specially in the very
high energy bands and the associated neutrino emission recently detected in some blazars.

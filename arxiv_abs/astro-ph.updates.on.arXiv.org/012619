The dust content of normal galaxies and the dust mass density (DMD) at high-z (z>4) are unconstrained
given the source confusion and the sensitivity limitations of previous observations. The ALMA
Large Program to INvestigate [CII] at Early Times (ALPINE), which targeted 118 UV-selected star-forming
galaxies at 4.4<z<5.9, provides a new opportunity to tackle this issue for the first time with a statistically
robust dataset. We have exploited the rest-frame far-infrared (FIR) fluxes of the 23 continuum
individually detected galaxies and stacks of continuum images to measure the dust content of the
118 UV-selected ALPINE galaxies. We have focused on the dust scaling relations and, by comparing
them with predictions from chemical evolution models, we have probed the evolutionary stage of
UV-selected galaxies at high-z. By using the observed correlation between the UV-luminosity and
the dust mass, we have estimated the DMD of UV-selected galaxies at z~5, weighting the galaxies by
means of the UV-luminosity function (UVLF). The derived DMD has been compared with the value we have
estimated from the 10 ALPINE far-IR continuum blindly detected galaxies at the redshift of the ALPINE
targets. The comparison of the observed dust scaling relations with chemical evolution models
suggests that ALPINE galaxies are not likely progenitors of disc galaxies, but of intermediate
and low mass proto-spheroids, resulting in present-day bulges of spiral or elliptical galaxies.
Interestingly, this conclusion is in line with the independent morphological analysis, that shows
that the majority (~70\%) of the dust-continuum detected galaxies have a disturbed morphology.
The DMD obtained at z~5 from UV-selected sources is ~30% of the value obtained from blind far-IR selected
sources, showing that the UV-selection misses the most dust-rich, UV-obscured galaxies.

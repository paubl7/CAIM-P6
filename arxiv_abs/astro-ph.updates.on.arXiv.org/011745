According to the Cosmological Principle, the Universe should appear isotropic, without any preferred
directions, to a comoving observer. However, a peculiar motion of the observer, or equivalently
of the solar system, might introduce a dipole anisotropy in some of the observed properties of the
Cosmos. The peculiar motion of the solar system, determined from the dipole anisotropy in the Cosmic
Microwave Background Radiation (CMBR), gave a velocity 370 km/s along l=264{\deg},b=48{\deg}.
However, dipoles from number counts, sky brightness or redshift distributions in large samples
of distant active galactic Nuclei (AGNs) have yielded values of the peculiar velocity many times
larger than that from the CMBR, though in all cases the directions agreed with the CMBR dipole. Here
we determine our peculiar motion from a sample of ~0.28 million AGNs, selected from the Mid Infra
Red Active Galactic Nuclei (MIRAGN) sample comprising more than a million sources. We find a peculiar
velocity more than four times the CMBR value, although the direction seems to be within ~2{\sigma}
of the CMBR dipole. Since a real solar peculiar velocity should be the same whatever may be the data
or the technique of observations, such discordant dipoles, could imply that the explanation for
the genesis of these dipoles, including that of the CMBR, might lie elsewhere. At the same time a common
direction for all these dipoles, determined from completely independent surveys by different
groups, does indicate that these dipoles are not merely due to some systematics, and it might instead
suggest a preferred direction in the Universe implying a genuine anisotropy, which would violate
the Cosmological Principle, the core of modern cosmology.

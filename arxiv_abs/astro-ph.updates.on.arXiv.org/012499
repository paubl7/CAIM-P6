We present measurements of the radial profiles of the mass and galaxy number density around Sunyaev-Zel'dovich-selected
clusters using both weak lensing and galaxy counts. The clusters are selected from the Atacama Cosmology
Telescope Data Release 5 and the galaxies from the Dark Energy Survey Year 3 dataset. With signal-to-noise
of 62 (43) for galaxy (weak lensing) profiles over scales of about $0.2-20h^{-1}$ Mpc, these are
the highest precision measurements for SZ-selected clusters to date. Because SZ selection closely
approximates mass selection, these measurements enable several tests of theoretical models of
the mass and light distribution around clusters. Our main findings are: 1. The splashback feature
is detected at a consistent location in both the mass and galaxy profiles and its location is consistent
with predictions of cold dark matter N-body simulations. 2. The full mass profile is also consistent
with the simulations; hence it can constrain alternative dark matter models that modify the mass
distribution of clusters. 3. The shapes of the galaxy and lensing profiles are remarkably similar
for our sample over the entire range of scales, from well inside the cluster halo to the quasilinear
regime. This can be used to constrain processes such as quenching and tidal disruption that alter
the galaxy distribution inside the halo, and scale-dependent features in the transition regime
outside the halo. We measure the dependence of the profile shapes on the galaxy sample, redshift
and cluster mass. We extend the Diemer \& Kravtsov model for the cluster profiles to the linear regime
using perturbation theory and show that it provides a good match to the measured profiles. We also
compare the measured profiles to predictions of the standard halo model and simulations that include
hydrodynamics. Applications of these results to cluster mass estimation and cosmology are discussed.

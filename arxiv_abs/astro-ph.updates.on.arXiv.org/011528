Observations suggest a power-law relation between the coronal emission in X-rays, $L_{\rm{X}}$,
and the total (unsigned) magnetic flux at the stellar surface, $\Phi$. The physics basis for this
relation is poorly understood. We use 3D MHD numerical models of the coronae above active regions,
i.e. strong concentrations of magnetic field, to investigate the $L_{\rm{X}}$ vs. $\Phi$ relation
and supply this by an analytical model based on simple well-established scaling relations. In the
3D MHD model horizontal (convective) motions near the surface induce currents in the coronal magnetic
field that are dissipated and heat the plasma. This self-consistently creates a million Kelvin
hot corona. We run a series of models that differ by the (unsigned) magnetic flux at the surface by
changing the (peak) magnetic field strength while keeping all other parameters fixed. In the 3D
MHD models we find that the energy input into the corona, characterized by either the Poynting flux
or the total volumetric heating, scales roughly quadratically with the unsigned surface flux $\Phi$.
This is expected from heating through field-line braiding. Our central result is the non-linear
scaling of the X-ray emission as $L_{\rm{X}}\propto \Phi^{3.44}$. This scaling is a bit steeper
than found in recent observations that give power-law indices of only up to 2 or 3. Assuming that on
a real star not only the peak magnetic field strength in the active regions changes but also their
number (or surface filling factor), our results can be consistent with observations. With our model,
we give indications of an understanding of what causes the steep increase of the X-ray luminosity
by four orders of magnitude from solar-type activity to fast rotating active stars.

Very low-mass Class I protostars have been investigated very little thus far. Variability of these
young stellar objects (YSOs) and whether or not they are capable of strong episodic accretion is
also left relatively unstudied. We investigate accretion variability in IRS54, a Class I very low-mass
protostar with a mass of M$_{\star}$ ~ 0.1 - 0.2 M$_{\odot}$. We obtained spectroscopic and photometric
data with VLT/ISAAC and VLT/SINFONI in the near-infrared ($J$, $H$, and $K$ bands) across four epochs
(2005, 2010, 2013, and 2014). We used accretion-tracing lines (Pa$\beta$ and Br$\gamma$) and outflow-tracing
lines (H$_2$ and [FeII] to examine physical properties and kinematics of the object. A large increase
in luminosity was found between the 2005 and 2013 epochs of more than 1 magnitude in the $K$ band, followed
in 2014 by a steep decrease. Consistently, the mass accretion rate ($\dot{M}_{acc}$) rose by an
order of magnitude from ~ 10$^{-8}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ to ~ $10^{-7}$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$
between the two early epochs. The visual extinction ($A_V$) has also increased from ~ 15 mag in 2005
to ~ 24 mag in 2013. This rise in $A_V$ in tandem with the increase in $\dot{M}_{acc}$ is explained
by the lifting up of a large amount of dust from the disc of IRS54, following the augmented accretion
and ejection activity in the YSO, which intersects our line of sight due to the almost edge-on geometry
of the disc. Because of the strength and timescales involved in this dramatic increase, this event
is believed to have been an accretion burst possibly similar to bursts of EXor-type objects. IRS54
is the lowest mass Class I source observed to have an accretion burst of this type, and therefore potentially
one of the lowest mass EXor-type objects known so far.

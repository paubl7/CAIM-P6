Supernova remnants (SNRs) are known to accelerate particles to relativistic energies, on account
of their nonthermal emission. The observational progress from radio to gamma-ray observations
reveals more and more morphological features that need to be accounted for when modeling the emission
from those objects. We use our time-dependent acceleration code RATPaC to study the formation of
extended gamma-ray halos around supernova remnants and the morphological implications that arise
when the high-energetic particles start to escape from the SNRs. We performed spherically symmetric
1D simulations in which we simultaneously solved the transport equations for cosmic rays, magnetic
turbulence, and the hydrodynamical flow of the thermal plasma. Our simulations span 25,000 years,
thus covering the free-expansion and the Sedov-Taylor phase of the SNR's evolution. We find a strong
difference in the morphology of the gamma-ray emission from SNRs at later stages dependent on the
emission process. At early times, both the inverse-Compton and the Pion-decay morphology are shell-like.
However, as soon as the maximum-energy of the freshly accelerated particles starts to fall, the
inverse-Compton morphology starts to become center-filled, whereas the Pion-decay morphology
keeps its shell-like structure. Escaping high-energy electrons start to form an emission halo
around the SNR at this time. There are good prospects for detecting this spectrally hard emission
with the future Cerenkov Telescope Array, as there are for detecting variations in the gamma-ray
spectral index across the interior of the SNR. Further, we find a constantly decreasing nonthermal
X-ray flux that makes a detection of X-ray unlikely after the first few thousand years of the SNR's
evolution. The radio flux is increasing throughout the SNR's lifetime and changes from a shell-like
to a more center-filled morphology later on.

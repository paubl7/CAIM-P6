Despite swift progress in the characterisation of exoplanet atmospheres in composition and structure,
the study of atmospheric dynamics has not progressed at the same speed. While theoretical models
have been developed to describe the lower layers of the atmosphere and, disconnected, the exosphere,
little is known about the intermediate layers up to the thermosphere. We aim to provide a clearer
picture of atmospheric dynamics for the class of ultra hot Jupiters, highly-irradiated gas giants,
on the example of WASP-76~b. We analysed two datasets jointly, obtained with the HARPS and ESPRESSO
spectrographs, to interpret the resolved planetary sodium doublet. We then applied an updated
version of the MERC code, with added planetary rotation, also provides the possibility to model
the latitude dependence of the wind patterns. We retrieve the highest Bayesian evidence for an isothermal
atmosphere, interpreted as a mean temperature of $3389\pm227$ K, a uniform day-to-night side wind
of $5.5^{+1.4}_{-2.0}\,$ km/s in the lower atmosphere with a vertical wind in the upper atmosphere
of $22.7^{+4.9}_{-4.1}\,$ km/s, switching atmospheric wind patterns at $10^{-3}$ bar above the
reference surface pressure ($10$ bar). Our results for WASP-76~b are compatible with previous
studies of the lower atmospheric dynamics of WASP-76~b and other ultra hot Jupiters. They highlight
the need for vertical winds in the intermediate atmosphere above the layers probed by global circulation
model studies to explain the line broadening of the sodium doublet in this planet. This work demonstrates
the capability of exploiting the resolved spectral line shapes to observationally constrain possible
wind patterns in exoplanet atmospheres, an invaluable input to more sophisticated 3D atmospheric
models in the future.

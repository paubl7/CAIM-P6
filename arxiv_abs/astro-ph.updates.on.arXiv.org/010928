Astrophysical disks are likely embedded in an ambient vertical magnetic field. This ambient field
is known to drive magneto-rotational turbulence in the disk bulk but is also responsible for the
launching of magnetized outflows at the origin of astrophysical jets. The vertical structure and
long-term (secular) evolution of such a system lack quantitative predictions. It is nevertheless
this secular evolution that is proposed to explain time variability in many accreting systems such
as X-ray binaries. We compute and analyze global 3D ideal-MHD simulations of an accretion disk threaded
by a large-scale magnetic field. We evaluate the role of the turbulent terms in the equilibrium of
the system. We then compute the transport of mass, angular momentum, and magnetic fields in the disk
to characterize its secular evolution. We perform a parameter survey to characterize the influence
of disk properties on secular transport. We find that weakly magnetized disks drive jets that carry
away a small fraction of the disk angular momentum. The mass-weighted accretion speed remains subsonic
although, there is always an upper turbulent atmospheric region where transonic accretion takes
place. We show that a strongly magnetized version of the magneto-rotational instability drives
this turbulence. The disk structure is drastically different from the conventional hydrostatic
picture. The magnetic field is always dragged inwards in the disk, at a velocity that increases with
the disk magnetization. Beyond a threshold on the latter, the disk undergoes a profound radial readjustment.
It leads to the formation of an inner accretion-ejection region with a supersonic mass-weighted
accretion speed and where the magnetic field distribution becomes steady, near equipartition
with the thermal pressure. This inner structure shares many properties with the Jet Emitting Disk
model described by Ferreira (1997).

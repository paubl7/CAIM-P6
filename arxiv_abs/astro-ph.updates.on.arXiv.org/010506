We analyze the gas mass distribution, the gas kinematics, and the young stellar object (YSO) content
of the California Molecular Cloud (CMC) L1482 filament. We derive a Gaia DR2 YSO distance of 511$^{+17}_{-16}$
pc. We derive scale-free power-laws for the mean gas line-mass (M/L) profiles; we calculate the
gravitational potential and field profiles consistent with these. We present IRAM 30 m C$^{18}$O
(1-0) (and other tracers) position-velocity (PV) diagrams that exhibit complex velocity twisting
and turning structures. We find a rotational profile in C$^{18}$O perpendicular to the southern
filament ridgeline. The profile is regular, confined ($r\lesssim0.4$ pc), anti-symmetric, and
to first order linear with a break at $r\sim0.25$ pc. The timescales of the inner (outer) gradients
are $\sim$0.7 (6.0) Myr. We show that the centripetal force, compared to gravity, increases toward
the break; when the ratio of forces approaches unity, the profile turns over, just before filament
breakup is achieved. The timescales and relative roles of gravity to rotation indicate that the
structure is stable, long lived ($\sim$ a few times 6 Myr), and undergoing outside-in evolution.
Moreover, this filament has practically no star formation, a perpendicular Planck plane-of-the-sky
(POS) magnetic field morphology, and POS "zig-zag" morphology, which together with the rotation
profile lead to the suggestion that the 3D shape is a corkscrew filament with a helical magnetic field.
These results, combined with results in Orion and G035.39-00.33, suggest evolution toward higher
densities as rotating filaments shed angular momentum. Thus, magnetic fields may be an essential
feature of high-mass (M $\sim10^5$ M$_{\odot}$) cloud filament evolution toward cluster formation.

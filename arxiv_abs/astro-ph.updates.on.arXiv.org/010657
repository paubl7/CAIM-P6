We present detailed simulations of kilonova (KN) and GRB afterglow emission originating from BH-NS
mergers. We present KN luminosity function and discuss the detectability of KN and GRB afterglow
in connection with GW detections, GW-triggered ToO observations, and blind searches in time-domain
survey observations. The predicted absolute magnitude of the BH-NS merger KNe at $0.5\,{\rm day}$
after the merger falls in the range of $[-10,-15.5]$. The simulated luminosity function contains
the viewing angle distribution information of the anisotropic KN emission. We simulate the GW detection
rates, detectable distances and signal duration, for the future networks of 2nd, 2.5th, and 3rd
generation GW detectors. BH-NS mergers produce brighter KNe and afterglows if the primary BH has
a high aligned-spin, and the NS is less-massive with a stiff EoS. The detectability of KN emission
is sensitive to the BH spin. If primary BHs typically have a low spin, the EM counterpart of BH-NSs
are hard to discover. For the 2nd generation GW detector networks, a limiting magnitude of $m_{\rm
limit}\sim23-24\,{\rm mag}$ is required to detect the KNe even if BH high spin is assumed. This could
provide a plausible explanation for the lack of KN detection from BH-NS candidates during O3: either
there is no EM counterpart, or the current follow-up observations are too shallow. These observations
may still have the chance to detect the on-axis jet afterglow associated with a sGRB or an orphan afterglow.
In future GW detection eras, more remote GW signals can be detected, but their associated KNe are
more difficult to detect. Follow up observations can in any case detect possible associated sGRB
afterglows, from which KN signatures may be studied. For time-domain survey observations, a high-cadence
search in redder filters is recommended to detect more BH-NS KNe and afterglows.

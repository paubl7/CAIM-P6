The discovery of gravitational wave radiation from merging black holes (BHs) also uncovered BHs
with masses in the range of ~20-90 Msun, which upon their merger became even more massive ones. In
contrast, the most massive Galactic stellar-mass BH currently known has a mass ~21 Msun. While low-mass
X-ray binaries (LMXBs) will never independently evolve into a binary BH system, and binary evolution
effects can play an important role explaining the different BH masses found through studies of LMXBs,
high-mass X-ray binaries, and gravitational wave events, (electromagnetic) selection effects
may also play a role in this discrepancy. Assuming BH LMXBs originate in the Galactic Plane where
massive stars are formed, we show that both the spatial distribution of the current sample of 20 Galactic
LMXBs with dynamically confirmed BH masses, and that of candidate BH LMXBs, are both strongly biased
to sources that lie at a large distance from the Galactic Plane. Specifically, most of the confirmed
and candidate BH LMXBs are found at a Galactic height larger than 3 times the scale height for massive
star formation. In addition, the confirmed BHs in LMXBs are found at larger distances to the Galactic
Center than the candidate BH LMXBs. Interstellar absorption makes candidate BH X-ray binaries
in the Plane and those in the Bulge close to the Galactic Center too faint for a dynamical mass measurement
using current instrumentation. Given the observed and theoretical evidence for BH natal and/or
Blaauw kicks, their relation with BH mass and binary orbital period, and the relation between outburst
recurrence time and BH mass, the observational selection effects imply that the current sample
of confirmed BH LMXBs is biased against the most massive BHs.

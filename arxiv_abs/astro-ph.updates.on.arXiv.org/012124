Accurate component separation of full-sky maps in the radio and microwave frequencies, such as
the cosmic microwave background (CMB), relies on a thorough understanding of the statistical properties
of the Galactic foreground emissions. Using scalar Minkowski functionals and their tensorial
generalization known as Minkowski tensors, we analyze the statistical properties of one of the
major foreground components, namely the Galactic synchrotron given by the full sky 408 MHz Haslam
map. We focus on understanding the nature of non-Gaussianity and statistical isotropy of the cooler
regions of the map as a function of angular scale. We find that the overall level of the non-Gaussian
deviations does decrease as more high emission regions are masked and as we go down to smaller scales,
in agreement with the results obtained in earlier works. However, they remain significantly high,
of order 3.3$\sigma$, at the smallest angular scales relevant for the Haslam map. We carry out a detailed
examination of the non-Gaussian nature using the generalized skewness and kurtosis cumulants
that arise in the perturbative expansion of Minkowski functionals for weakly non-Gaussian fields.
We find that the leading sources of non-Gaussianity are the kurtosis terms which are considerably
larger than the skewness terms at all angular scales. Further, for the cooler regions of the Haslam
map, we find that the non-Gaussian deviations of the Minkowski functionals can be well explained
by the perturbative expansion up to second-order (up to kurtosis terms), with first-order terms
being sub-dominant. Lastly, we test the statistical isotropy of the Haslam map and find that it becomes
increasingly more isotropic at smaller scales.

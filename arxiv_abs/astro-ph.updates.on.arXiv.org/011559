We present constraints on the physical properties (including stellar mass, age, and star formation
rate) of 207 $6\lesssim z \lesssim8$ galaxy candidates from the Reionization Lensing Cluster Survey
(RELICS) and companion Spitzer-RELICS surveys. We measure photometry using T-PHOT and perform
spectral energy distribution fitting using EA$z$Y and BAGPIPES. Of the 207 candidates for which
we could successfully measure Spitzer fluxes, 23 were demoted to likely low redshift ($z<4$). Among
the remaining high redshift candidates, we find intrinsic stellar masses between $1\times10^6\rm{M_{\odot}}$
and $4\times10^9\rm{M_\odot}$, and rest-frame UV absolute magnitudes between $-22.6$ and $-14.5$
mag. While our sample is mostly comprised of $L_{UV}/L^*_{UV}<1$ galaxies, there are a number of
brighter objects in the sample, extending to $L_{UV}/L^*_{UV}\sim2$. The galaxies in our sample
span approximately four orders of magnitude in stellar mass and star-formation rates, and exhibit
ages ranging from maximally young to maximally old. We highlight 11 galaxies which have detections
in Spitzer/IRAC imaging and redshift estimates $z\geq6.5$, several of which show evidence for
some combination of evolved stellar populations, large contributions of nebular emission lines,
and/or dust. Among these is PLCKG287+32-2013, one of the brightest $z\sim7$ candidates known (AB
mag 24.9) with a Spitzer 3.6$\mu$m flux excess suggesting strong [OIII] + H-$\beta$ emission ($\sim$1000\AA\
rest-frame equivalent width). We discuss the possible uses and limits of our sample and present
a public catalog of Hubble 0.4--1.6$\mu$m + Spitzer 3.6$\mu$m and 4.5$\mu$m photometry along with
physical property estimates for all 207 objects in the sample. Because of their apparent brightnesses,
high redshifts, and variety of stellar populations, these objects are excellent targets for follow-up
with James Webb Space Telescope.

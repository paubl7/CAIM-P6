Recent theoretical and observational studies debate the similarities between the formation process
of high-mass (>8 Msun) and low-mass stars. The formation of low-mass star formation is directly
associated with the presence of disks and jets. According to this scenario, radio jets are expected
to be common in high-mass star-forming regions. We aim to increase the number of known radio jets
in high-mass star forming regions by searching for radio jet candidates at radio continuum wavelengths.
We have used the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) to observe 18 high-mass star-forming regions
in the C band (6 cm, ~1.0 arcsec resolution) and K band (1.3 cm, ~0.3 arcsec resolution). We have searched
for radio jet candidates by studying the association of radio continuum sources with shock activity
signposts. We have identified 7 as the most probable radio jets. The radio luminosity of the radio
jet candidates is correlated with the bolometric luminosity and the outflow momentum rate. About
7-36% of the radio jet candidates are associated with non-thermal emission. The radio jet candidates
associated with 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser emission are preferentially thermal winds and jets, while a
considerable fraction of radio jet candidates associated with H2O masers show non-thermal emission,
likely due to strong shocks. Our sample of 18 regions is divided in 8 less evolved, infrared-dark
regions and 10 more evolved, infrared-bright regions. We have found that ~71% of the identified
radio jet candidates are located in the more evolved regions. Similarly, 25% of the less evolved
regions harbor one of the most probable radio jets, while up to 50% of the more evolved regions contain
one of these radio jet candidates. This suggests that the detection of radio jets in high-mass star
forming regions is larger in slightly more evolved regions.

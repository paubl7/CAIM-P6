We present photometric and spectroscopic analyses of gravity (g-mode) long-period pulsating
hot subdwarf B (sdB) stars. We perform a detailed asteroseismic and spectroscopic analysis of five
pulsating sdB stars observed with {\it TESS} aiming at the global comparison of the observations
with the model predictions based on our stellar evolution computations coupled with the adiabatic
pulsation computations. We apply standard seismic tools for mode identification, including asymptotic
period spacings and rotational frequency multiplets. We calculate the mean period spacing for
$l = 1$ and $l = 2$ modes and estimate the errors by means of a statistical resampling analysis. For
all stars, atmospheric parameters were derived by fitting synthetic spectra to the newly obtained
low-resolution spectra. We have computed stellar evolution models using {\tt LPCODE} stellar
evolution code, and computed $l = 1$ g-mode frequencies with the adiabatic non-radial pulsation
code {\tt LP-PUL}. Derived observational mean period spacings are then compared to the mean period
spacings from detailed stellar evolution computations coupled with the adiabatic pulsation computations
of g-modes. The atmospheric parameters derived from spectroscopic data are typical of long-period
pulsating sdB stars with the effective temperature ranging from 23\,700\,K to 27\,600\,K and surface
gravity spanning from 5.3\,dex to 5.5\,dex. In agreement with the expectations from theoretical
arguments and previous asteroseismological works, we find that the mean period spacings obtained
for models with small convective cores, as predicted by a pure Schwarzschild criterion, are incompatible
with the observations. We find that models with a standard/modest convective boundary mixing at
the boundary of the convective core are in better agreement with the observed mean period spacings
and are therefore more realistic.

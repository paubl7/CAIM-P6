Numerous examples of ram pressure stripping in galaxy clusters are present in literature; however,
substantially less work has been focused on ram pressure stripping in lower mass groups. In this
work we use the LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) to search for jellyfish galaxies in ~500 SDSS groups
(z<0.05), making this the most comprehensive search for ram pressure stripping in groups to date.
We identify 60 jellyfish galaxies in groups with extended, asymmetric radio continuum tails, which
are found across the entire range of group mass from $10^{12.5} < M_\mathrm{group} < 10^{14}\,h^{-1}\,\mathrm{M_\odot}$.
We compare the group jellyfish galaxies identified in this work with the LoTSS jellyfish galaxies
in clusters presented in Roberts et al. (2021), allowing us to compare the effects of ram pressure
stripping across three decades in group/cluster mass. We find that jellyfish galaxies are most
commonly found in clusters, with the frequency decreasing towards the lowest mass groups. Both
the orientation of observed radio continuum tails, and the positions of group jellyfish galaxies
in phase space, suggest that galaxies are stripped more slowly in groups relative to clusters. Finally,
we find that the star formation rates of jellyfish galaxies in groups are consistent with `normal'
star-forming group galaxies, which is in contrast to cluster jellyfish galaxies that have clearly
enhanced star formation rates. On the whole, there is clear evidence for ongoing ram pressure stripping
in galaxy groups (down to very low group masses), though the frequency of jellyfish galaxies and
the strength of ram pressure stripping appears smaller in groups than clusters. Differences in
the efficiency of ram pressure stripping in groups versus clusters likely contributes to the positive
trend between quenched fraction and host halo mass observed in the local Universe.

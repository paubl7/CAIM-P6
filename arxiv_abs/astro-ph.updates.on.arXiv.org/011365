We investigate the structural properties of cluster and group galaxies by studying the Fornax main
cluster and the infalling Fornax A group, exploring the effects of galaxy preprocessing in this
showcase example. Additionally, we compare the structural complexity of Fornax galaxies to those
in the Virgo cluster and in the field. Our sample consists of 582 galaxies from the Fornax main cluster
and Fornax A group. We quantified the light distributions of each galaxy based on a combination of
aperture photometry, S\'ersic+PSF (point spread function) and multi-component decompositions,
and non-parametric measures of morphology (Concentration $C$; Asymmetry $A$, Clumpiness $S$;
Gini $G$; second order moment of light $M_{20}$), and structural complexity based on multi-component
decompositions. These quantities were then compared between the Fornax main cluster and Fornax
A group. The structural complexity of Fornax galaxies were also compared to those in Virgo and in
the field. Overall, we find significant differences in the distributions of quantities derived
from S\'ersic profiles ($g'-r'$, $r'-i'$, $R_e$, and $\bar{\mu}_{e,r'}$), and non-parametric
indices ($A$ and $S$) between the Fornax main cluster and Fornax A group. Moreover, we find significant
cluster-centric trends with $r'-i'$, $R_e$, and $\bar{\mu}_{e,r'}$, as well as $A$, $S$, $G$,
and $M_{20}$ for galaxies in the Fornax main cluster. We find the structural complexity of galaxies
increases as a function of the absolute $r'$-band magnitude (and stellar mass), with the largest
change occurring between -14 mag $\lesssim M_{r'}\lesssim$ -19 mag. This same trend was observed
for galaxies in the Virgo cluster and in the field, which suggests that the formation or maintenance
of morphological structures (e.g. bulges, bar) is largely dependent on the stellar mass of the galaxies,
rather than their environment.

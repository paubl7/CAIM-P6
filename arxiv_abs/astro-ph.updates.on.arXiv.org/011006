We combine several constraints provided by the crater records on Arrokoth and the worlds of the Pluto
system to compute the size-frequency distribution (SFD) of the crater production function for
craters with diameter D<10km. For this purpose, we use a Kuiper belt objects (KBO) population model
calibrated on telescopic surveys, that describes also the evolution of the KBO population during
the early Solar System. We further calibrate this model using the crater record on Pluto, Charon
and Nix. Using this model, we compute the impact probability on Arrokoth, integrated over the age
of the Solar System. This probability is then used together with other observational constraints
to determine the slope of the crater-production function on Arrokoth. In addition, we use our Kuiper
belt model also to compare the impact rates and velocities of KBOs on Arrokoth with those on Charon,
integrated over the crater retention ages of their respective surfaces. This allows us to establish
a relationship between the spatial density of sub-km craters on Arrokoth and of D~20km craters on
Charon. Together, all these considerations suggest the crater production function on these worlds
has a cumulative power law slope of -1.5<q<-1.2. Converted into a projectile SFD slope, we find -1.2<q_KBO<-1.0.
These values are close to the cumulative slope of main belt asteroids in the 0.2--2~km range, a population
in collisional equilibrium. For KBOs, however, this slope appears to extend from ~2km down to objects
a few tens of meters in diameter, as inferred from sub-km craters on Arrokoth. From the measurement
of the dust density in the Kuiper belt made by the New Horizons mission, we predict that the SFD of the
KBOs becomes steep again below ~10-30m. All these considerations strongly indicate that the size
distribution of the KBO population is in collisional equilibrium.

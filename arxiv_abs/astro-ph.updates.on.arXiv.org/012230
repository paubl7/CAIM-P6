Oxygen is a promising exoplanet biosignature due to the evolutionary advantage conferred by harnessing
starlight for photosynthesis, and the apparent low likelihood of maintaining oxygen-rich atmospheres
without life. Hypothetical scenarios have been proposed for non-biological oxygen accumulation
on planets around late M-dwarfs, where the extended pre-main sequence may favor abiotic O$_2$ accumulation.
In contrast, abiotic oxygen accumulation on planets around F, G, and K-type stars is seemingly less
likely, provided they possess substantial non-condensable gas inventories. The comparative
robustness of oxygen biosignatures around larger stars has motivated plans for next-generation
telescopes capable of oxygen detection on planets around sun-like stars. However, the general
tendency of terrestrial planets to develop oxygen-rich atmospheres across a broad range of initial
conditions and evolutionary scenarios has not been explored. Here, we use a coupled thermal-geochemical-climate
model of terrestrial planet evolution to illustrate three scenarios whereby significant abiotic
oxygen can accumulate around sun-like stars, even when significant non-condensable gas inventories
are present. For Earth-mass planets, we find abiotic oxygen can accumulate to modern levels if (1)
the CO$_2$:H$_2$O ratio of the initial volatile inventory is high, (2) the initial water inventory
exceeds ~50 Earth oceans, or (3) the initial water inventory is very low. Fortunately, these three
abiotic oxygen scenarios could be distinguished from biological oxygen with observations of other
atmospheric constituents or characterizing the planetary surface. This highlights the need for
broadly capable next-generation telescopes that are equipped to constrain surface water inventories
via time-resolved photometry and search for temporal biosignatures or disequilibrium biosignatures
to assess whether oxygen is biogenic.

High-precision pulsar timing requires accurate corrections for dispersive delays of radio waves,
parametrized by the dispersion measure (DM), particularly if these delays are variable in time.
In a previous paper we studied the Solar-wind (SW) models used in pulsar timing to mitigate the excess
of DM annually induced by the SW, and found these to be insufficient for high-precision pulsar timing.
Here we analyze additional pulsar datasets to further investigate which aspects of the SW models
currently used in pulsar timing can be readily improved, and at what levels of timing precision SW
mitigation is possible. Our goals are to verify: a) whether the data are better described by a spherical
model of the SW with a time-variable amplitude rather than a time-invariant one as suggested in literature,
b) whether a temporal trend of such a model's amplitudes can be detected. We use the pulsar-timing
technique on low-frequency pulsar observations to estimate the DM and quantify how this value changes
as the Earth moves around the Sun. Specifically, we monitor the DM in weekly to monthly observations
of 14 pulsars taken with LOFAR across time spans of up to 6 years. We develop an informed algorithm
to separate the interstellar variations in DM from those caused by the SW and demonstrate the functionality
of this algorithm with extensive simulations. Assuming a spherically symmetric model for the SW
density, we derive the amplitude of this model for each year of observations. We show that a spherical
model with time-variable amplitude models the observations better than a spherical model with
constant amplitude, but that both approaches leave significant SW induced delays uncorrected
in a number of pulsars in the sample. The amplitude of the spherical model is found to be variable in
time, as opposed to what has been previously suggested.

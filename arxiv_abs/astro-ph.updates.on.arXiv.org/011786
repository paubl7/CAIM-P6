We report on gravitational wave discoveries from compact binary coalescences detected by Advanced
LIGO and Advanced Virgo in the first half of the third observing run (O3a) between 1 April 2019 15:00
UTC and 1 October 2019 15:00. By imposing a false-alarm-rate threshold of two per year in each of the
four search pipelines that constitute our search, we present 39 candidate gravitational wave events.
At this threshold, we expect a contamination fraction of less than 10%. Of these, 26 candidate events
were reported previously in near real-time through GCN Notices and Circulars; 13 are reported here
for the first time. The catalog contains events whose sources are black hole binary mergers up to
a redshift of ~0.8, as well as events whose components could not be unambiguously identified as black
holes or neutron stars. For the latter group, we are unable to determine the nature based on estimates
of the component masses and spins from gravitational wave data alone. The range of candidate events
which are unambiguously identified as binary black holes (both objects $\geq 3~M_\odot$) is increased
compared to GWTC-1, with total masses from $\sim 14~M_\odot$ for GW190924_021846 to $\sim 150~M_\odot$
for GW190521. For the first time, this catalog includes binary systems with significantly asymmetric
mass ratios, which had not been observed in data taken before April 2019. We also find that 11 of the
39 events detected since April 2019 have positive effective inspiral spins under our default prior
(at 90% credibility), while none exhibit negative effective insprial spin. Given the increased
sensitivity of Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo, the detection of 39 candidate events in ~26 weeks
of data (~1.5 per week) is consistent with GWTC-1.

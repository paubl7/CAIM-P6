In this work we explore the possibility of applying machine learning methods designed for one-dimensional
problems to the task of galaxy image classification. The algorithms used for image classification
typically rely on multiple costly steps, such as the Point Spread Function (PSF) deconvolution
and the training and application of complex Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) of thousands or
even millions of parameters. In our approach, we extract features from the galaxy images by analysing
the elliptical isophotes in their light distribution and collect the information in a sequence.
The sequences obtained with this method present definite features allowing a direct distinction
between galaxy types, as opposed to smooth S\'ersic profiles. Then, we train and classify the sequences
with machine learning algorithms, designed through the platform Modulos AutoML, and study how
they optimize the classification task. As a demonstration of this method, we use the second public
release of the Dark Energy Survey (DES DR2). We show that by applying it to this sample we are able to
successfully distinguish between early-type and late-type galaxies, for images with signal-to-noise
ratio greater then 300. This yields an accuracy of $86\%$ for the early-type galaxies and $93\%$
for the late-type galaxies, which is on par with most contemporary automated image classification
approaches. Our novel method allows for galaxy images to be accurately classified and is faster
than other approaches. Data dimensionality reduction also implies a significant lowering in computational
cost. In the perspective of future data sets obtained with e.g. Euclid and the Vera Rubin Observatory
(VRO), this work represents a path towards using a well-tested and widely used platform from industry
in efficiently tackling galaxy classification problems at the peta-byte scale.

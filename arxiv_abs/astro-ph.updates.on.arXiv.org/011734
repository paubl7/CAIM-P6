High-quality astronomical images delivered by modern ground-based and space observatories demand
adequate, reliable software for their analysis and accurate extraction of sources, filaments,
and other structures, containing massive amounts of detailed information about the complex physical
processes in space. The multi-wavelength observations with highly variable angular resolutions
across wavebands require extraction tools that preserve and use the invaluable high-resolution
information. This paper presents getsf, a new method for extracting sources and filaments in astronomical
images using separation of their structural components, designed to handle multi-wavelength
sets of images and very complex filamentary backgrounds. The method spatially decomposes the original
images and separates the structural components of sources and filaments from each other and from
their backgrounds, flattening their resulting images. It spatially decomposes the flattened
components, combines them over wavelengths, detects the positions of sources and skeletons of
filaments, and measures the detected sources and filaments. This paper presents a realistic multi-wavelength
set of simulated benchmark images that can serve as the standard benchmark problem to evaluate qualities
of source and filament extraction methods. This paper describes hires, an improved algorithm for
the derivation of high-resolution surface densities from the multi-wavelength far-infrared
Herschel images. The algorithm allows creation of the surface densities with angular resolutions
reaching 5.6 arcsec, when using the 70 micron image. Both getsf and hires are illustrated by their
applications to a variety of images, from the X-ray domain to the millimeter wavelengths.

The connection between the Stellar Velocity Ellipsoid (SVE) and the dynamical evolution of galaxies
has been a matter of debate in the last years and there is no clear consensus whether different heating
agents (e.g. spiral arms, giant molecular clouds, bars and mergers) leave clear detectable signatures
in the present day kinematics. Most of these results are based on a single and global SVE and have not
taken into account that these agents do not necessarily equally affect all regions of the stellar
disc.We study the 2D spatial distribution of the SVE across the stellar discs of Auriga galaxies,
a set of high resolution magneto-hydrodynamical cosmological zoom-in simulations, to unveil
the connection between local and global kinematic properties in the disc region. We find very similar,
global, $\sigma_{z}/\sigma_{r}$= 0.80$\pm$ 0.08 values for galaxies of different Hubble types.
This shows that the global properties of the SVE at z=0 are not a good indicator of the heating and cooling
events experienced by galaxies. We also find that similar $\sigma_{z}/\sigma_{r}$radial profiles
are obtained through different combinations of $\sigma_{z}$ and $\sigma_{r}$ trends: at a local
level, the vertical and radial components can evolve differently, leading to similar $\sigma_{z}/\sigma_{r}$
profiles at z=0. By contrast, the 2D spatial distribution of the SVE varies a lot more from galaxy
to galaxy. Present day features in the SVE spatial distribution may be associated with specific
interactions such as fly-by encounters or the accretion of low mass satellites even in the cases
when the global SVE is not affected. The stellar populations decomposition reveals that young stellar
populations present colder and less isotropic SVEs and more complex 2D distributions than their
older and hotter counterparts.

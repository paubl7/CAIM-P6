During the X-ray bursts of GS 1826$-$24, "clocked burster", the nuclear reaction flow that surges
through the rapid-proton capture process path has to pass through the NiCu cycles before reaching
the ZnGa cycles that moderate the further extent of hydrogen burning in the region above germanium
and selenium isotopes. The $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn reaction located in the NiCu cycles
plays an important role in influencing the burst light curves as found by Cyburt et al. (2016). We
deduce the $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn reaction rate based on the experimentally determined
important nuclear structure information, isobaric-multiplet-mass equation, and large-scale
shell model calculations. With the isobaric-multiplet-mass equation, we propose a possible order
of $1^+_1$ and $2^+_3$ dominant resonance states that the $2^+_3$ resonance state is higher than
the $1^+_1$ state, and estimate the resonance energy of $1^+_2$ contributing resonance state.
The new rate is up to a factor of five lower than the Forstner et al. (2001) rate recommended by JINA
REACLIB v2.2. Using the one-dimensional implicit hydrodynamic code, KEPLER, to model the thermonuclear
X-ray bursts of GS 1826$-$24 clocked burster, we find that the new $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn
reaction redistributes the reaction flow in the NiCu cycles and reduces the production of $^{58}$Zn,
whereas the $^{59}$Cu(p,$\alpha$)$^{56}$Ni and $^{59}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{60}$Zn reactions
suppress the influence of the $^{57}$Cu(p,$\gamma$)$^{58}$Zn reaction and strongly diminish
the impact of nuclear reaction flow that by-passes the important $^{56}$Ni waiting point induced
by the $^{55}$Ni(p,$\gamma$)$^{56}$Cu reaction on burst light curve. The influence of the newly
deduced $^{56}$Ni(p,$\gamma$)$^{57}$Cu is also discussed.

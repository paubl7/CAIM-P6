We report upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope observations of the massive merging galaxy
cluster Abell 2744. The cluster is experiencing a very complex multiple merger and hosts a giant
halo and four radio relics. To study the spectral and polarization properties, and radio versus
X-ray correlations of the diffuse sources, we complement our analysis with existing VLA and Chandra
observations. In our new images, the central halo emission is observed to be more extended than detected
previously. The integrated spectrum of the halo follows a power-law between 150 MHz and 3 GHz, while
its subregions show significantly different spectra also featuring high frequency spectral steepening.
Our results highlight that an overall power-law spectrum, as observed in many radio halos, may also
arise from the superposition of different subcomponents. The radio brightness distribution of
the halo strongly correlates with the X-ray brightness of the intracluster medium (ICM) with a constant
sublinear slope from 675 MHz to 3 GHz. The comparison of the spectral index with the X-ray brightness
and temperature reveals different trends, indicating that the halo consists of two main components
with distinct evolutionary signatures. All four relics in this system follow a power-law radio
spectrum, compatible with shocks with Mach number in the range $3.0-4.5$. All relics are also highly
polarized between $1-4$ GHz and show Faraday dispersion measures below $10 \rm rad m^{-2}$, suggesting
that they are located in the low density ICM. The complexity in the distribution and properties of
nonthermal components in Abell 2744 support a multiple merger scenario. Our results demonstrate
the importance of sensitive and high-resolution, multi-frequency radio observations for understanding
the interplay between the thermal and non-thermal components of the ICM.

We report the discovery of a circumstellar debris disk viewed nearly edge-on and associated with
the young, K1 star BD+45$^{\circ}$598 using high-contrast imaging at 2.2$\mu$m obtained at the
W.M.~Keck Observatory. We detect the disk in scattered light with a peak significance of $\sim$5$\sigma$
over three epochs, and our best-fit model of the disk is an almost edge-on $\sim$70 AU ring, with inclination
angle $\sim$87$^\circ$. Using the NOEMA interferometer at the Plateau de Bure Observatory operating
at 1.3mm, we find resolved continuum emission aligned with the ring structure seen in the 2.2$\mu$m
images. We estimate a fractional infrared luminosity of $L_{IR}/L_{tot}$ $\simeq6^{+2}_{-1}$$\times$$10^{-4}$,
higher than that of the debris disk around AU Mic. Several characteristics of BD+45$^{\circ}$598,
such as its galactic space motion, placement in a color-magnitude diagram, and strong presence
of Lithium, are all consistent with its membership in the $\beta$ Pictoris Moving Group with an age
of 23$\pm$3 Myr. However, the galactic position for BD+45$^{\circ}$598 is slightly discrepant
from previously-known members of the $\beta$ Pictoris Moving Group, possibly indicating an extension
of members of this moving group to distances of at least 70pc. BD+45$^{\circ}$598 appears to be an
example from a population of young circumstellar debris systems associated with newly identified
members of young moving groups that can be imaged in scattered light, key objects for mapping out
the early evolution of planetary systems from $\sim$10-100 Myr. This target will also be ideal for
northern-hemisphere, high-contrast imaging platforms to search for self-luminous, planetary
mass companions residing in this system.

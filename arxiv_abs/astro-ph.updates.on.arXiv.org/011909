Aims. This work provides an analysis of how the galaxy number density of the input data affects the
filaments detected with the Bisous filament finder and gives estimates of the reliability of the
method itself to assess the robustness of the results. Methods. We applied the Bisous filament finder
to MultiDark-Galaxies data, using various magnitude cuts from the catalogue to study the effects
of different galaxy number densities on the results and different parameters of the model. We compared
the structures by the fraction of galaxies in filaments and the volume filled by filaments, and we
analysed the similarities between the results from different cuts based on the overlap between
detected filamentary structures. The filament finder was also applied to the exact same data 200
times with the same parameters to study the stochasticity of the results and the correlation between
different runs was calculated. Results. Multiple samples show that galaxies in filaments have
preferentially higher luminosity. We found that when a galaxy is in a filament there is a 97% chance
that the same galaxy would be in a filament with even more complete input data and about 85% of filaments
are persistent when detecting the filamentary network with higher-density input data. Lower galaxy
number density inputs mean the Bisous model finds fewer filaments, but the filaments found are persistent
even if we use more complete input data for the detection. We calculated the correlation coefficient
between 200 Bisous runs on the exact same input, which is 0.98. Conclusions. This study confirms
that increased number density of galaxies is important to obtain a more complete picture of the cosmic
web. To overcome the limitation of the spectroscopic surveys, we will develop the Bisous model further
to apply this tool to combined spectroscopic and narrow-band photometric redshift surveys, such
as the J-PAS.

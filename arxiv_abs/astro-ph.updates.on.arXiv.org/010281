It is now widely accepted that most ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) are binary systems whose
large (above $10^{39}$ erg s$^{-1}$) apparent luminosities are explained by super-Eddington
accretion onto a stellar-mass compact object. Many of the ULXs, especially those containing magnetized
neutron stars, are highly variable; some exhibit transient behaviour. Large luminosities might
imply large accretion discs that could be therefore prone to the thermal-viscous instability known
to drive outbursts of dwarf novae and low-mass X-ray binary transient sources. The aim of this paper
is to extend and generalize the X-ray transient disc-instability model to the case of large (outer
radius larger than $10^{12}$ cm) accretion discs and apply it to the description of systems with
super-Eddington accretion rates at outburst and, in some cases, super-Eddington mass transfer
rates. We have used our disc-instability-model code to calculate the time evolution of the accretion
disc and the outburst properties. We show that, provided that self-irradiation of the accretion
disc is efficient even when the accretion rate exceeds the Eddington value, possibly due to scattering
back of the X-ray flux emitted by the central parts of the disc on the outer portions of the disc, heating
fronts can reach the disc's outer edge generating high accretion rates. We also provide analytical
approximations for the observable properties of the outbursts. We have reproduced successfully
the observed properties of galactic transients with large discs, such as V404 Cyg, as well as some
ULXs such as M51 XT-1. Our model can reproduce the peak luminosity and decay time of ESO 243-39 HLX-1
outbursts if the accretor is a neutron star. Observational tests of our predicted relations between
the outburst duration and decay time with peak luminosity would be most welcome.

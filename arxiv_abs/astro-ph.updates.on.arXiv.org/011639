We discuss the current state of knowledge of terrestrial planet formation from the aspects of different
planet formation models and isotopic data from 182Hf-182W, U-Pb, lithophile-siderophile elements,
48Ca/44Ca isotope samples from planetary building blocks, 36Ar/38Ar, 20Ne/22Ne, 36Ar/22Ne isotope
ratios in Venus' and Earth's atmospheres, the expected solar 3He abundance in Earth's deep mantle
and Earth's D/H sea water ratios that shed light on the accretion time of the early protoplanets.
Accretion scenarios that can explain the different isotope ratios, including a Moon-forming event
after ca. 50 Myr, support the theory that the bulk of Earth's mass (>80%) most likely accreted within
10-30 Myr. From a combined analysis of the before mentioned isotopes, one finds that proto-Earth
accreted 0.5-0.6 MEarth within the first ~4-5 Myr, the approximate lifetime of the protoplanetary
disk. For Venus, the available atmospheric noble gas data are too uncertain for constraining the
planet's accretion scenario accurately. However, from the available Ar and Ne isotope measurements,
one finds that proto-Venus could have grown to 0.85-1.0 MVenus before the disk dissipated. Classical
terrestrial planet formation models have struggled to grow large planetary embryos quickly from
the tiniest materials within the typical lifetime of protoplanetary disks. Pebble accretion could
solve this long-standing time scale controversy. Pebble accretion and streaming instabilities
produce large planetesimals that grow into Mars-sized and larger planetary embryos during this
early accretion phase. The later stage of accretion can be explained well with the Grand-Tack, annulus
or depleted disk models. The relative roles of pebble accretion and planetesimal accretion/giant
impacts are poorly understood and should be investigated with N-body simulations that include
pebbles and multiple protoplanets.

Although interesting in themselves, extragalactic sources emitting in the microwave range (mainly
radio-loud active galactic nuclei and dusty galaxies) are also considered a contaminant from the
point of view of Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) experiments. These sources appear as unresolved
point-like objects in CMB measurements because of the limited resolution of CMB experiments. Amongst
other issues, point-like sources are known to obstruct the reconstruction of the lensing potential,
and can hinder the detection of the Primordial Gravitational Wave Background for low values of $r$.
Therefore, extragalactic point-source detection and subtraction is a fundamental part of the
component separation process necessary to achieve some of the science goals set for the next generation
of CMB experiments. As a previous step to their removal, in this work we have designed a filter based
on steerable wavelets that allows the characterization of the emission of these extragalactic
sources. Instead of the usual approach of working in polarization maps of the Stokes' $Q$ and $U$
parameters, the proposed filter operates on E- and B-mode polarization maps. In this way, it benefits
from the lower intensity that, both, the CMB, and the galactic foreground emission present in B-modes
to improve its performance. For the regions of fainter galactic foreground emission in the 30 GHz
and 155 GHz bands of the future PICO satellite, and assuming that the sources were already detected
by other means, we predict that our filter will be able to characterize sources down to a minimum polarization
intensity of, respectively, 117 pK and 8 pK, wich, adopting a $\Pi$=0.02 polarization degree, correspond
to 119 mJy and 164 mJy intensities.

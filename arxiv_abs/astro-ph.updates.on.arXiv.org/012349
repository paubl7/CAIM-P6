The detailed nature of type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) remains uncertain, and as survey statistics increase,
the question of astrophysical systematic uncertainties arises, notably that of the evolution
of SN Ia populations. We study the dependence on redshift of the SN Ia light-curve stretch, a purely
intrinsic SN property, to probe its potential redshift drift. The SN stretch has been shown to be
strongly correlated with the SN environment, notably with stellar age tracers. We modeled the underlying
stretch distribution as a function of redshift, using the evolution of the fraction of young and
old SNe Ia as predicted using the SNfactory dataset, and assuming a constant underlying stretch
distribution for each age population consisting of Gaussian mixtures. We tested our prediction
against published samples that were cut to have marginal magnitude selection effects so that any
observed change is indeed astrophysical and not observational in origin. In this first study, there
are indications that the underlying SN Ia stretch distribution evolves as a function of redshift,
and that the age drifting model is a better description of the data than any time-constant model,
including the sample-based asymmetric distributions that are often used to correct Malmquist
bias at a significance higher than 5 $\sigma$. The favored underlying stretch model is a bimodal
one, composed of a high-stretch mode shared by both young and old environments, and a low-stretch
mode that is exclusive to old environments. The precise effect of the redshift evolution of the intrinsic
properties of a SN Ia population on cosmology remains to be studied. The astrophysical drift of the
SN stretch distribution does affect current Malmquist bias corrections and hence the distances
that are derived using SNe that are affected by observational selection effects. This bias increases
with surveys covering larger redshift ranges.

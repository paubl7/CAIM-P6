In-situ measurements by several spacecraft have revealed that the solar wind is frequently perturbed
by transient structures (magnetic folds, jets, waves, flux-ropes) that propagate rapidly away
from the Sun over large distances. Parker Solar Probe has detected frequent rotations of the magnetic
field vector at small heliocentric distances, accompanied by surprisingly large solar wind rotation
rates. The physical origin of such magnetic field bends, the conditions for their survival across
the interplanetary space, and their relation to solar wind rotation are yet to be clearly understood.
We traced measured solar wind flows from the spacecraft position down to the surface of the Sun to
identify their potential source regions and used a global MHD model of the corona and solar wind to
relate them to the rotational state of the low solar corona. We identified regions of the solar corona
for which solar wind speed and rotational shear are important and long-lived, that can be favourable
to the development of magnetic deflections and to their propagation across extended heights in
the solar wind. We show that coronal rotation is highly structured and that enhanced flow shear develops
near the boundaries between coronal holes and streamers, around and above pseudo-streamers, even
when such boundaries are aligned with the direction of solar rotation. A large fraction of the switchbacks
identified by PSP map back to these regions, both in terms of instantaneous magnetic field connectivity
and of the trajectories of wind streams that reach the spacecraft. These regions of strong shears
are likely to leave an imprint on the solar wind over large distances and to increase the transverse
speed variability in the slow solar wind. The simulations and connectivity analysis suggest they
can be a source of the switchbacks and spikes observed by Parker Solar Probe.

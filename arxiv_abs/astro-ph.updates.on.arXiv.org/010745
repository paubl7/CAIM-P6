The discovery of GRB 170817A, the first unambiguous off-axis short gamma-ray burst arising from
a neutron star merger, has challenged our understanding of the angular structure of relativistic
jets. The late afterglow of GRB 170817A has been described by a structured jet seen slightly off-axis
(at an observer angle of $\approx 20^\circ$--$30^\circ$). Studies of the jet dynamics and propagation
usually assume that the jet is ejected from the central engine with a top-hat structure and its final
structure, which determines the observed light curve and spectra, is primarily regulated by the
interaction with the nearby environment. However, relativistic jets are expected to be produced
with a structure that is more complex than a simple top-hat, as shown by global accretion simulations.
In this work, we present results of numerical simulations of short GRBs launched with a wide range
of initial structures, durations, luminosities, and ejection time histories. We follow the interaction
of the jet with the pre-collapse, merger remnant wind and compute its final structure at distances
$\gtrsim 10^{11}$~cm from the central engine. We show that the final jet structure, as well as the
resulting afterglow emission (at much larger distances), depend strongly on the initial structure
of the jet, its luminosity and duration. We find that the initial structure at the jet is preserved
for long-lasting SGRBs, while it is strongly modified for jets barely making their way through the
wind. This illustrates the importance of combining the results of global simulations with propagation
studies in order to better predict the expected afterglow signatures from neutron star mergers.
Structured jets provide a reasonable description of the GRB 170817A afterglow emission with an
off-axis angle $\theta_{\rm obs} \approx 22.5^\circ$ while top-hat jets do not.

The disruption of asteroids and comets produces cm-sized meteoroids that end up impacting the Earth's
atmosphere and producing bright fireballs that might have associated shock waves or, in geometrically-favorable
occasions excavate craters that put them into unexpected hazardous scenarios. The astrometric
reduction of meteors and fireballs to infer their atmospheric trajectories and heliocentric orbits
involves a complex and tedious process that generally requires many manual tasks. To streamline
the process, we present a software package called SPMN 3D Fireball Trajectory and Orbit Calculator
(3D-FireTOC), an automatic Python code for detection, trajectory reconstruction of meteors,
and heliocentric orbit computation from video recordings. The automatic 3D-FireTOC package comprises
of a user interface and a graphic engine that generates a realistic 3D representation model, which
allows users to easily check the geometric consistency of the results and facilitates scientific
content production for dissemination. The software automatically detects meteors from digital
systems, completes the astrometric measurements, performs photometry, computes the meteor atmospheric
trajectory, calculates the velocity curve, and obtains the radiant and the heliocentric orbit,
all in all quantifying the error measurements in each step. The software applies corrections such
as light aberration, refraction, zenith attraction, diurnal aberration and atmospheric extinction.
It also characterizes the atmospheric flight and consequently determines fireball fates by using
the $\alpha - \beta$ criterion that analyses the ability of a fireball to penetrate deep into the
atmosphere and produce meteorites. We demonstrate the performance of the software by analyzing
two bright fireballs recorded by the Spanish Fireball and Meteorite Network (SPMN).

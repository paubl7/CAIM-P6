We present LAMOST J0140355+392651 (hereafter J0140), a close ($P_{\rm orb} = 3.81$ hours) binary
containing a bloated, low-mass ($M \approx 0.15 M_{\odot}$) proto-white dwarf (WD) and a massive
($M\approx 0.95\,M_{\odot}$) WD companion. The system's optical light curve is dominated by large-amplitude
ellipsoidal variability but also exhibits additional scatter, likely driven by pulsations. The
proto-WD is cooler ($T_{\rm eff} = 6800\pm 100$ K) and more puffy ($\log\left[g/\left({\rm cm\,s^{-2}}\right)\right]=4.74\pm0.07$)
than any known extremely low mass (ELM) WD, but hotter than any known cataclysmic variable (CV) donor.
It either completely or very nearly fills its Roche lobe ($R/R_{{\rm Roche\,lobe}}=0.99\pm0.01$),
suggesting ongoing or recently terminated mass transfer. No dwarf nova-like outbursts have been
observed. The spectrum is dominated by the proto-WD but shows tentative hints of H$\alpha$ emission,
perhaps due to accretion onto the massive WD. The properties of the system are well-matched by MESA
binary evolution models of CVs with donors that underwent significant nuclear evolution before
the onset of mass transfer. In these models, the bloated proto-WD is either still losing mass via
stable Roche lobe overflow or was doing so until very recently. In either case, it is evolving toward
higher temperatures at near-constant luminosity to become an ELM WD. If the system is detached,
mass transfer likely ended when the donor became too hot for magnetic braking to remain efficient.
Evolutionary models predict that the binary will shrink to $P_{\rm orb}\lesssim 10$ minutes within
a few Gyr, when it will either merge or become an AM CVn binary. J0140 provides an observational link
between the formation channels of CVs, ELM WDs, detached ultracompact WD binaries, and AM CVn systems.

The decade-long Vista Variables in the Via Lactea (VVV) survey has detected numerous highly variable
young stellar objects (YSOs). We present a study of 61 highly variable VVV YSOs ($\Delta K_s$ = 1-5
mag), combining near infrared spectra from Magellan and VLT with VVV and NEOWISE light curves to
investigate physical mechanisms behind eruptive events. Most sources are spectroscopically
confirmed as eruptive variables (typically Class I YSOs) but variable extinction is also seen.
Among them, magnetically controlled accretion, identified by H{\sc i} recombination emission
(usually accompanied by CO emission), is observed in 46 YSOs. Boundary layer accretion, associated
with FU Ori-like outbursts identified by CO overtone and H$_2$O absorption, is observed only in
longer duration events ($\ge$5 yr total duration). However, even in long duration events, the magnetically
controlled accretion mode predominates, with amplitudes similar to the boundary layer mode. Shorter
(100-700 days) eruptive events usually have lower amplitudes and these events are generally either
periodic accretors or multiple timescale events, wherein large photometric changes occur on timescales
of weeks and years. We find that the ratio of amplitudes in $K_s$ and $W2$ can distinguish between
variable accretion and variable extinction. Several YSOs are periodic or quasi-periodic variables.
We identify examples of periodic accretors and extinction-driven periodicity among them (with
periods up to 5 yr) though more data are needed to classify some cases. The data suggest that dynamic
interactions with a companion may control the accretion rate in a substantial proportion of eruptive
systems, although star-disc interactions should also be considered.

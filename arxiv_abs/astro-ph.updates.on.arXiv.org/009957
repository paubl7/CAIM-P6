Abridged. We aim at exploring to which extent the remnant keeps memory of the asymmetries that develop
stochastically in the neutrino-heating layer due to hydrodynamic instabilities (e.g., convective
overturn and the standing accretion shock instability) during the first second after core bounce.
We coupled a 3D HD model of a neutrino-driven SN explosion with 3D MHD/HD simulations of the remnant
formation. The simulations cover 2000 years of expansion and include all physical processes relevant
to describe the complexities in the SN evolution and the subsequent interaction of the stellar debris
with the wind of the progenitor star. The interaction of large-scale asymmetries left from the earliest
phases of the explosion with the reverse shock produces, at the age of $\approx 350$~years, an ejecta
structure and a remnant morphology which are remarkably similar to those observed in Cas A. Small-scale
structures in the large-scale Fe-rich plumes created during the initial stages of the SN, combined
with HD instabilities that develop after the passage of the reverse shock, naturally produce a pattern
of ring- and crown-like structures of shocked ejecta. The consequence is a spatial inversion of
the ejecta layers with Si-rich ejecta being physically interior to Fe-rich ejecta. The full-fledged
remnant shows voids and cavities in the innermost unshocked ejecta resulting from the expansion
of Fe-rich plumes and their inflation due to the decay of radioactive species. The asymmetric distributions
of $^{44}$Ti and $^{56}$Fe and their abundance ratio are both compatible with those inferred from
high-energy observations of Chandra and NuSTAR. The main asymmetries observed in the ejecta distribution
of Cas A can be explained by the interaction of the reverse shock with the large-scale asymmetries
that developed from stochastic processes that originate during the first seconds of the SN blast.

In light of the newly opened and rapidly growing gravitational waves window in multi-messenger
astronomy, in order to fully take advantage of the new opportunities we are provided with, new ideas
are required for a better and deeper employ of the state-of-the-art probes we handle. Following
this goal, here we suggest a method to constrain the cosmological background, and the Hubble constant
in particular, by future observations of gravitationally lensed radiation emitted by a single
source in both the gravitational wave and the electromagnetic regimes. The lensing of the gravitational
wave radiation, in fact, can leave a clear imprinting in the corresponding waveform, and we want
to analyze if such kind of measurements can be successfully employed to better constrain the cosmological
background. Thus, by making use of wave optics for the gravitational wave lensed signal, and of standard
geometrical optics approximation for the electromagnetic one, we study the impact of different
cosmological parameters on the value of the arrival time delay due to gravitational lensing, given
specific gravitational wave frequencies, mass models of the lens, and redshifts and positions
(with respect to the lens) of the source. Although the rate of lensing of gravitational waves is expected
to be low, we show that even one single lensing event, combined with a prior on $\Omega_m$ from \textit{Planck},
could provide us with an uncertainty on $H_0$ comparable with present independent probes in a "pessimistic"
scenario (with a pulsar population similar to present Pulsar Timing Array state), and of two orders
smaller in an optimistic one (with a number of observed pulsars as large as that expected from the
Square Kilometer Array). Thus, its role in the solution of the Hubble tension could be decisive.

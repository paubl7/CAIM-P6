A gravitational-wave (GW) early-warning of a compact-binary coalescence event, with a sufficiently
tight localisation skymap, would allow telescopes to point in the direction of the potential electromagnetic
counterpart before its onset. This will enable astronomers to extract valuable information of
the complex astrophysical phenomena triggered around the time of the merger. Use of higher-modes
of gravitational radiation, in addition to the dominant mode typically used in templated real-time
searches, was recently shown to produce significant improvements in early-warning times and skyarea
localisations for a range of asymmetric-mass binaries. In this work, we perform a large-scale study
to assess the benefits of this method for a population of compact binary merger observations. In
particular, we inject 100,000 such signals in Gaussian noise, with component masses $m_1 \in \left[1,
60 \right] M_{\odot}$ and $m_2 \in \left [1, 3 \right] M_{\odot}$. We consider three scenarios involving
ground-based detectors: the fifth (O5) observing run of the Advanced LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA network,
its projected Voyager upgrade, as well as a proposed third generation (3G) network. We find that
for fixed early warning times of $20-60$ seconds, the inclusion of the higher modes can provide localisation
improvements of a factor of $\gtrsim 2$ for up to $\sim 60\%$ ($70 \%$) of the neutron star-black hole
systems in the O5 (Voyager) scenario. Considering only those neutron star-black hole systems which
can produce potential electromagnetic counterparts, such improvements in the localisation can
be expected for $\sim 5-35\%$ $(20-50\%)$ binaries in O5 (Voyager), although the localisation
areas themselves depend on the distances. For the 3G scenario, a significant fraction of the events
have time gains of a minute to several minutes, assuming fiducial target localisation areas of 100
to 1000 sq. deg.

Context. Gamma-ray binaries are systems that radiate the dominant part of their non-thermal emission
in the gamma-ray band. In a wind-driven scenario, these binaries are thought to consist of a pulsar
orbiting a massive star, accelerating particles in the shock arising in the wind collision. Aims.
We develop a comprehensive, numerical model for the non-thermal emission of shock accelerated
particles including the dynamical effects of fluid instabilities and orbital motion. We demonstrate
the model on a generic binary system. Methods. The model is built on a dedicated three-dimensional
particle transport simulation for the accelerated particles dynamically coupled to a simultaneous
relativistic hydrodynamic simulation of the wind interaction. In a post-processing step, a leptonic
emission model involving synchrotron and inverse Compton emission is evaluated based on resulting
particle distributions and fluid solutions, consistently accounting for relativistic boosting
and $\gamma\gamma$-absorption in the stellar radiation field. The model is implemented as an extension
to the Cronos code. Results. In the generic binary, the wind interaction leads to the formation of
an extended, asymmetric wind-collision region distorted by the effects of orbital motion, mixing
and turbulence giving rise to strong shocks terminating the pulsar wind and secondary shocks in
the turbulent fluid flow. With the presented approach it is, for the first time, possible to consistently
account for the dynamical shock structure in particle transport processes, yielding a complex
distribution of accelerated particles. The predicted emission extends over a broad region of energy,
with significant orbital modulation in all bands.

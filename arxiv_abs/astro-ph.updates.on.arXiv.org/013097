Gas at high Galactic latitude is a relatively little-noticed component of the interstellar medium.
In an effort to address this, forty-one Planck Galactic Cold Clumps at high Galactic latitude (HGal;
$|b|>25^{\circ}$) were observed in $^{12}$CO, $^{13}$CO and C$^{18}$O J=1-0 lines, using the
Purple Mountain Observatory 13.7-m telescope. $^{12}$CO (1-0) and $^{13}$CO (1-0) emission was
detected in all clumps while C$^{18}$O (1-0) emission was only seen in sixteen clumps. The highest
and average latitudes are $71.4^{\circ}$ and $37.8^{\circ}$, respectively. Fifty-one velocity
components were obtained and then each was identified as a single clump. Thirty-three clumps were
further mapped at 1$^\prime$ resolution and 54 dense cores were extracted. Among dense cores, the
average excitation temperature $T_{\mathrm{ex}}$ of $^{12}$CO is 10.3 K. The average line widths
of thermal and non-thermal velocity dispersions are $0.19$ km s$^{-1}$ and $0.46$ km s$^{-1}$ respectively,
suggesting that these cores are dominated by turbulence. Distances of the HGal clumps given by Gaia
dust reddening are about $120-360$ pc. The ratio of $X_{13}$/$X_{18}$ is significantly higher
than that in the solar neighbourhood, implying that HGal gas has a different star formation history
compared to the gas in the Galactic disk. HGal cores with sizes from $0.01-0.1$ pc show no notable
Larson's relation and the turbulence remains supersonic down to a scale of slightly below $0.1$
pc. None of the HGal cores which bear masses from 0.01-1 $M_{\odot}$ are gravitationally bound and
all appear to be confined by outer pressure. Above all, HGal gas represents a different phase of local
ISM and greatly improves our knowledge of the initial condition of star formation.

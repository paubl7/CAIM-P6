CTCV J2056-3014 is a nearby cataclysmic variable (CV) with an orbital period of approximately $1.76$
hours at a distance of about $853$ light-years from the Earth. \cite{2020ApJ...898L..40L} report
on its X-ray properties, which suggest J2056-3014 to be an unusual accretion-powered intermediate
polar (IP) harboring a fast-spinning white dwarf (WD) with a spin period of $29.6$ s. The low X-ray
luminosity and the relatively modest accretion rate per unit area suggest that the shock is not occurring
near the WD surface. Under these conditions, the authors argue that the maximum temperature of the
shock cannot be directly used to determine the mass of the WD (which under such assumptions would
be around $0.46$ $M_\odot$). Here, we explore the stability of this rapidly rotating WD using a modern
equation of state (EoS) which accounts for electron-ion, electron-electron, and ion-ion interactions.
For this EoS, we determine the mass density thresholds for the onset of pycnonuclear fusion reactions
and study the impact of microscopic stability and rapid rotation on the structure and stability
of carbon WDs. From this analysis we obtain a minimum mass for CTCV J2056-3014 of $0.56~M_\odot$,
and a maximum mass of around $1.38~M_\odot$. If the mass of CTCV J2056-3014 should be close to the
lower mass limit, its equatorial radius would be on the order of $10^4$ km, due to rapid rotation.
Such a value is significantly greater than the radius of a non-rotating WD of average mass ($0.6\,
M_\odot$), which is on the order of $7\times 10^3$ km. The effects in the minimum mass value of J2056-3014
due to temperature and matter composition, where also a pure oxygen and a mixture of oxygen and neon
WDs were considered, are shown to be negligible.

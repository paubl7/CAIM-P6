The single-lined spectroscopic binary $\nu$ Octantis provided evidence of the first conjectured
circumstellar planet demanding an orbit retrograde to the stellar orbits. The planet-like behaviour
is now based on 1437 radial velocities (RVs) acquired from 2001-2013. $\nu$ Oct's semimajor axis
is only 2.6 AU with the candidate planet orbiting $\nu$ Oct A about midway between. These details
seriously challenge our understanding of planet formation and our decisive modelling of orbit
reconfiguration and stability scenarios, whilst having a host that is equally inconsistent with
accepted stellar variability scenarios. All non-planetary explanations are less credible based
on multiple qualitative and quantitative tests including previous spectroscopic studies of bisectors
and line-depth ratios, photometry from Hipparcos and the more recent space missions TESS and GAIA
(whose increased parallax classifies $\nu$ Oct A closer still to a subgiant ~ K1 IV). We conducted
the first large survey of $\nu$ Oct A's chromosphere: 198 Ca II H-line and 1160 H $\alpha$ indices
using spectra from a previous RV campaign (2009-2013). We also acquired 135 spectra (2018-2020)
primarily used for additional line-depth ratios, which are extremely sensitive to the photosphere's
temperature. We found no significant RV-correlated variability. Our line-depth ratios indicate
temperature variations of only $\pm$ 4 K, as achieved previously. Our atypical Ca II analysis models
the indices in terms of S/N and includes covariance significantly in their errors. The H $\alpha$
indices have a quasi-periodic variability which we demonstrate is due to telluric lines. Our new
evidence provides further multiple arguments realistically only in favor of the planet.

We present a reanalysis of GW151226, the second binary black hole merger discovered by the LIGO-Virgo
Collaboration. Previous analysis showed that the best-fit waveform for this event corresponded
to the merger of a $\sim 14 \, M_\odot$ black hole with a $\sim 7.5 \, M_\odot$ companion. In this work,
we perform parameter estimation using a waveform model that includes the effects of orbital precession
and higher-order radiative multipoles, and find that the mass and spin parameters of GW151226 have
bimodal posterior distributions. The two modes are separated in mass ratio, $q$: the high-$q$ mode
($0.4 \lesssim q < 1$) is consistent with the results reported in the literature. On the other hand,
the low-$q$ mode ($q \lesssim 0.4$), which describes a binary with component masses of $\sim 29 \,
M_\odot$ and $\sim \, 4.3 M_\odot$, is new. The low-$q$ mode has several interesting properties:
(a) the secondary black hole mass may fall in the lower mass gap of astrophysical black hole population;
and (b) orbital precession is driven by the primary black hole spin, which has a dimensionless magnitude
as large as $\sim 0.88$ and is tilted away from the orbital angular momentum at an angle of $\sim 47^\circ$.
The new low-$q$ mode has a log likelihood that is about six points higher than that of the high-$q$
mode, and can therefore affect the astrophysical interpretation of GW151226. Crucially, we show
that the low-$q$ mode disappears if we neglect either higher multipoles or orbital precession in
the parameter estimation. More generally, this work highlights how incorporating additional
physical effects into waveform models used in parameter estimations can alter the interpretation
of gravitational-wave sources.

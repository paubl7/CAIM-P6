We study how the interaction between the streaming instability and intrinsic gas-phase turbulence
affects planetesimal formation via gravitational collapse in protoplanetary disks. Turbulence
impedes the formation of particle clumps by acting as an effective turbulent diffusivity, but it
can also promote planetesimal formation by concentrating solids, for example in zonal flows. We
quantify the effect of turbulent diffusivity using numerical simulations of the streaming instability
in small local domains, forced with velocity perturbations that establish approximately Kolmogorov-like
turbulence. We find that planetesimal formation is suppressed by turbulence once velocity fluctuations
exceed $\langle \delta v^2 \rangle \simeq 10^{-3.5} - 10^{-3} c_s^2$. Turbulence whose strength
is just below the threshold reduces the rate at which solids are bound into clumps. Our results suggest
that the well-established turbulent thickening of the mid-plane solid layer is the primary mechanism
by which turbulence influences planetesimal formation and that planetesimal formation requires
a mid-plane solid-to-gas ratio $\epsilon \gtrsim 0.5$. We also quantify the initial planetesimal
mass function using a new clump-tracking method to determine each planetesimal mass shortly after
collapse. For models in which planetesimals form, we show that the mass function is well-described
by a broken power law, whose parameters are robust to the inclusion and strength of imposed turbulence.
Turbulence in protoplanetary disks is likely to substantially exceed the threshold for planetesimal
formation at radii where temperatures $T \gtrsim 10^3 \ {\rm K}$ lead to thermal ionization. Planetesimal
formation may therefore be unviable in the inner disk out to 2-3 times the dust sublimation radius.

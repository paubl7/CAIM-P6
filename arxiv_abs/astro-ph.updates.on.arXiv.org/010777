Lyman alpha emitters (LAEs) in the Epoch of Reionization (EoR) offer valuable probes of early galaxy
evolution and the process of reionization; however, the exact evolution of their abundance and
the nature of their emission remain open questions. We combine samples of 229 and 349 LAE candidates
at $z=5.7$ and $z=6.6,$ respectively, from the SILVERRUSH narrowband survey with deep Low Frequency
Array (LOFAR) radio continuum observations in the ELAIS-N1 field to search for radio galaxies in
the EoR and study the low-frequency radio properties of $z\gtrsim5.7$ LAE emitters. Our LOFAR observations
reach an unprecedented noise level of $\sim20\,\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ at 150MHz, and we detect five
candidate LAEs at $>5\sigma$ significance. Based on detailed spectral energy distribution modelling
of independent multi-wavelength observations, we conclude that these sources are likely [OII]
emitters at $z=1.47$, yielding no reliable $z\gtrsim5.7$ radio galaxy candidates. We examine
the 111 $z=5.7$ and $z=6.6$ LAE candidates from our panchromatic photometry catalogue that are
undetected by LOFAR, finding contamination rates of 81-92% for the $z=5.7$ and $z=6.6$ subset of
the LAE candidate samples. This subset is biased towards brighter magnitudes and redder near-infrared
colours. The contamination rates of the full sample will therefore likely be lower than the reported
values. Contamination is lowered significantly through constraints on the near-infrared colours,
highlighting the need for infrared observations to robustly identify bright LAEs in narrowband
surveys. Finally, the stacking of radio continuum observations for the robust LAE samples yields
2$\sigma$ upper limits on radio luminosity of 8.2$\times$10$^{23}$ and 8.7$\times$10$^{23}$
W Hz$^{-1}$ at $z=5.7$ and $6.6$, respectively, corresponding to limits on their median star-formation
rates of $<$53 and $<$56 M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$.

We investigate the infrared (IR) emission of high-redshift ($z\sim 6$), highly star-forming (${
{\rm SFR} > 100}$ $M_{\rm \odot} {\rm yr}^{-1}$) galaxies, with/without Active Galactic Nuclei
(AGN), using a suite of cosmological simulations featuring dust radiative transfer. Synthetic
Spectral Energy Distributions (SEDs) are used to quantify the relative contribution of stars/AGN
to dust heating. In dusty (${M_{\rm d}\gtrsim 3\times 10^7 M_{\rm \odot}}$) galaxies, $\gtrsim
50-90 \%$ of the UV radiation is obscured by dust inhomogeneities on scales ${\gtrsim 100}$ pc. In
runs with AGN, a clumpy, warm ($\approx 250$ K) dust component co-exists with a colder ($\approx
60$ K) and more diffuse one, heated by stars. Warm dust provides up to ${50 \%}$ of the total IR luminosity,
but only $\lesssim 0.1 \%$ of the total mass content. The AGN boosts the MIR flux by ${10-100 \times}$
with respect to star forming galaxies, without significantly affecting the FIR. Our simulations
successfully reproduce the observed SED of bright (${M_{\rm UV}\sim -26}$) ${z\sim 6}$ quasars,
and show that these objects are part of complex, dust-rich merging systems, containing multiple
sources (accreting BHs and/or star forming galaxies) in agreement with recent HST and ALMA observations.
Our results show that the proposed ORIGINS missions will be able to investigate the MIR properties
of dusty star forming galaxies and to obtain good quality spectra of bright quasars at $z\sim 6$.
Finally, the MIR-to-FIR flux ratio of faint (${M_{\rm UV}\sim -24}$) AGN is ${>10\times}$ higher
than for normal star forming galaxies. This implies that combined JWST/ORIGINS/ALMA observations
will be crucial to identify faint and/or dust-obscured AGN in the distant Universe.

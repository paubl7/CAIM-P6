We consider Horndeski modified gravity models obeying stability, velocity of gravitational waves
$c_T$ equals $c$ and quasistatic approximation (QSA) on subhorizon scales. We assume further a
$\Lambda$CDM background expansion and a monotonic evolution on the cosmic background of the $\alpha$
functions as $\alpha_i= \alpha_{i0}~a^s$ where $i=M,B$, $a$ is the scale factor and $\alpha_{i0}$
($\alpha_{M0}, \alpha_{B0}$), $s$ are arbitrary parameters. We show that the growth and lensing
reduced (dimensionless) gravitational couplings $\mu\equiv G_{\rm growth}/G$, $\Sigma\equiv
G_{\rm lensing}/G$ exhibit the following generic properties today: $\Sigma_0 < 1$ for all viable
parameters, $\mu_0<1$ (weak gravity today) is favored for small $s$ while $\mu_0>1$ is favored
for large $s$. We establish also the relation $\mu\geq \Sigma$ at all times. Taking into account
the $f\sigma_8$ and $E_G$ data constrains the parameter $s$ to satisfy $s\lesssim 2$. Hence these
data select essentially the weak gravity regime today ($\mu_0<1$) when $s<2$, while $\mu_0>1$
subsists only marginally for $s\approx 2$. At least the interval $0.5\lesssim s \lesssim 2$ would
be ruled out in the absence of screening. We consider further the growth index $\gamma(z)$ and identify
the $(\alpha_{M0},\alpha_{B0},s)$ parameter region that corresponds to specific signs of the
differences $\gamma_0-\gamma_0^{\Lambda CDM}$, and $\gamma_1-\gamma_1^{\Lambda CDM}$, where
$\gamma_0\equiv \gamma\bigl|_{z=0}$ and $\gamma_1\equiv \frac{{\rm d}\gamma}{\rm d z}\bigl|_{z=0}$.
In this way important information is gained on the past evolution of $\mu$. We obtain in particular
the signature $\gamma_0>\gamma_0^{\Lambda CDM}$ for $s<2$ in the selected weak gravity region.

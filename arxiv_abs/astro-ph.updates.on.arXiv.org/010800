Amongst the hydrogen-deficient accreting binaries known as the "AM~CVn stars" are three systems
with the shortest known orbital periods: HM Cnc (321 s), V407 Vul (569 s) and ES Cet (620 s). These compact
binaries are predicted to be strong sources of persistent gravitational wave radiation. HM Cnc
and V407 Vul are undergoing direct impact accretion in which matter transferred from their donor
hits the accreting white dwarfs directly. ES Cet, is the longest period of the three and is amongst
the most luminous AM CVn stars, but it is not known whether it accretes via a disk or direct impact.
ES Cet displays strong HeII 4686 line emission, which is sometimes a sign of magnetically-controlled
accretion. Peculiarly, although around one third of hydrogen accreting white dwarfs show evidence
for magnetism, none have been found amongst helium accretors. We present the results of Magellan
and VLT spectroscopic and spectropolarimetric observing campaigns dedicated to ES Cet with the
aim of understanding its accretion structure. We find strong variability in our spectra on the 620
s period. The lines show evidence for double-peaked emission, characteristic for an accretion
disc, with an additional component associated with the outermost disc, rather than a direct impact,
that is broadly consistent with "S"-wave emission from the gas stream/disc impact region. This
confirms beyond any doubt that 620\,s is the orbital period of ES Cet. We find no significant circular
polarisation (below 0.1 %). The trailed spectra show that ES Cet's outer disc is eclipsed by the mass
donor, revealing at the same time that the photometric minimum coincides with the hitherto unrecognised
eclipse. ES Cet shows spectroscopic behaviour consistent with accretion via a disc, and is the shortest
orbital period eclipsing AM CVn star known.

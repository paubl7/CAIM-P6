Aims: Response of a protoplanetary disk to luminosity bursts of various duration is studied with
the purpose to determine the effect of the bursts on the strength and sustainability of gravitational
instability in the disk. A special emphasis is paid to the spatial distribution of gas and grown dust
(from 1 mm to a few cm) during and after the burst. Methods: Numerical hydrodynamics simulations
using the FEOSAD code were employed to study the dynamics of gas and dust in the thin-disk limit. Dust-to-gas
friction including back reaction and dust growth were also considered. Bursts of various duration
(from 100 to 500 yr) were initiated in accordance with a thermally ignited magnetorotational instability.
Luminosity curves for constant- and declining-magnitude bursts were adopted to represent two
typical limiting cases for FU-Orionis-type eruptions. Results: The short-term effect of the burst
is to reduce the strength of gravitational instability by heating and expanding the disk. The longest
bursts with duration comparable to the revolution period of the spiral can completely dissolve
the original two-armed spiral pattern in the gas disk by the end of the burst, while the shortest bursts
only weaken the spiral pattern. The reaction of grown dust to the burst is somewhat different. The
spiral-like initial distribution with deep cavities in the inter-armed regions transforms into
a ring-like distribution with deep gaps. This transformation is most expressed for the longest-duration
bursts. The long-term effect of the burst depends on the initial disk conditions at the onset of the
burst. In some cases, vigorous disk fragmentation sets in several thousand years after the burst,
which was absent in the model without the bursts (abridged).

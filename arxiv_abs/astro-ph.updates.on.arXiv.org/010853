Faraday tomography offers crucial information on the magnetized astronomical objects, such as
quasars, galaxies, or galaxy clusters, by observing its magnetoionic media. The observed linear
polarization spectrum is inverse Fourier transformed to obtain the Faraday dispersion function
(FDF), providing us a tomographic distribution of the magnetoionic media along the line of sight.
However, this transform gives a poor reconstruction of the FDF because of the instrument's limited
wavelength coverage. The current Faraday tomography techniques' inability to reliably solve
the above inverse problem has noticeably plagued cosmic magnetism studies. We propose a new algorithm
inspired by the well-studied area of signal restoration, called the Constraining and Restoring
iterative Algorithm for Faraday Tomography (CRAFT). This iterative model-independent algorithm
is computationally inexpensive and only requires weak physically-motivated assumptions to produce
high fidelity FDF reconstructions. We demonstrate an application for a realistic synthetic model
FDF of the Milky Way, where CRAFT shows greater potential over other popular model-independent
techniques. The dependence of observational frequency coverage on the various techniques' reconstruction
performance is also demonstrated for a simpler FDF. CRAFT exhibits improvements even over model-dependent
techniques (i.e., QU-fitting) by capturing complex multi-scale features of the FDF amplitude
and polarization angle variations within a source. The proposed approach will be of utmost importance
for future cosmic magnetism studies, especially with broadband polarization data from the Square
Kilometre Array and its precursors. We make the CRAFT code publicly available.

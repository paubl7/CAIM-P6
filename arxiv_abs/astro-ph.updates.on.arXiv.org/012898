We present the first study of nearby M dwarfs with the ROentgen Survey with an Imaging Telescope Array
(eROSITA) on board the Russian Spektrum-Roentgen-Gamma mission (SRG). To this end we extracted
the Gaia DR2 data for the ~9000 nearby M dwarfs in the superblink proper motion catalog and calculated
their stellar parameters from empirical relations with optical-IR colors. We cross-matched this
catalog with the eROSITA Final Equatorial Depth Survey (eFEDS) and the first eROSITA all-sky survey
(eRASS1). Our sample consists of 704 stars (SpT = K5-M7). This unprecedented data base for X-ray
emitting M dwarfs allowed to quantitatively constrain the mass dependence of the X-ray luminosity,
and to determine the change in the activity level with respect to pre-main-sequence stars. We also
combined these data with the Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) observations that are
available for 501 of 704 X-ray detected M dwarfs and determined the rotation period for 180 of them.
With the joint eROSITA-TESS sample, and combining it with our historical X-ray and rotation data
for M dwarfs, we examined the mass dependence in the saturated regime of the rotation-activity relation.
A first comparison of eROSITA hardness ratios and spectra shows that 65% of our X-ray detected M dwarfs
have coronal temperatures of $\sim 0.5$ keV. We investigated their long-term X-ray variability
by comparing the eRASS1 and ROSAT all-sky survey (RASS) measurements. Evidence for X-ray flares
is found in various parts of our analysis: directly from inspection of the eFEDS light curves, in
the relation between RASS and eRASS1 X-ray luminosities, and in stars displaying X-ray emission
hotter than the bulk of the sample according to the hardness ratios. Finally, we point out the need
of X-ray spectroscopy for more M dwarfs to study the coronal temperature-luminosity relation,
not well constrained by our eFEDS results.

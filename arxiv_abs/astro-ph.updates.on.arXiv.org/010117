The North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) project has the primary
goal of detecting and characterizing low-frequency gravitational waves through high-precision
pulsar timing. The mitigation of interstellar effects is crucial to achieve the necessary precision
for gravitational wave detection. Effects like dispersion and scattering are more influential
at lower observing frequencies, with the variation of these quantities over week-month timescales
requiring high-cadence multi-frequency observations for pulsar timing projects. In this work,
we utilize the dual-frequency observing capability of the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT)
and evaluate the potential decrease in dispersion measure (DM) uncertainties when combined with
existing pulsar timing array data. We present the timing analysis for four millisecond pulsars
observed with the GMRT simultaneously at 322 and 607 MHz, and compare the DM measurements with those
obtained through NANOGrav observations with the Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and Arecibo Observatory
at 1400 to 2300 MHz frequencies. Measured DM values with the GMRT and NANOGrav program show significant
offsets for some pulsars, which could be caused by pulse profile evolution in the two frequency bands.
In comparison to the predicted DM uncertainties when incorporating these low-frequency data into
the NANOGrav dataset, we find that higher-precision GMRT data is necessary to provide improved
DM measurements. Through the detection and analysis of pulse profile baseline ripple in data on
test pulsar B1929+10, we find that, while not important for this data, it may be relevant for other
timing datasets. We discuss the possible advantages and challenges of incorporating GMRT data
into NANOGrav and International Pulsar Timing Array datasets.

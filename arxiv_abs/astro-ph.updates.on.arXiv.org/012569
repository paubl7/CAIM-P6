Over the last few years instruments such as VLT/SPHERE and Subaru/HiCIAO have been able to take detailed
scattered light images of protoplanetary discs. Many of the features observed in these discs are
generally suspected to be caused by an embedded planet, and understanding the cause of these features
requires detailed theoretical models. In this work we investigate disc-planet interactions using
the PLUTO code to run 2D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations of protoplanetary discs with embedded 30
M$_{\oplus}$ and 300 M$_{\oplus}$ planets on both an inclined ($i = 2.86^{\circ}$) and non-inclined
orbit, using an $\alpha$-viscosity of $4 \times 10^{-3}$. We produce synthetic scattered-light
images of these discs at \emph{H-band} wavelengths using the radiative transfer code RADMC3D.
We find that while the surface density evolution in 2D and 3D simulations of inclined and non-inclined
planets remain fairly similar, their observational appearance is remarkably different. Most
of the features seen in the synthetic \emph{H-band} images are connected to density variations
of the disc at around 3.3 scale heights above and below the midplane, which emphasizes the need for
3D simulations. Planets on sustained orbital inclinations disrupt the disc's upper-atmosphere
and produce radically different observable features and intensity profiles, including shadowing
effects and intensity variation in the order of 10-20 times the surrounding background. The vertical
optical depth to the disc midplane for \emph{H-band} wavelengths is $\tau \approx 20$ in the disc
gap created by the high-mass planet. We conclude that direct imaging of planets embedded in the disc
remains difficult to observe, even for massive planets in the gap.

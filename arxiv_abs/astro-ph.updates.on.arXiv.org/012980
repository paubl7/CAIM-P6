Theoretical prediction of surface stellar abundances of light elements -- lithium, beryllium,
and boron -- represents one of the most interesting open problems in astrophysics. As well known,
several measurements of 7-Li abundances in stellar atmospheres point out a disagreement between
predictions and observations in different stellar evolutionary phases, rising doubts about the
capability of present stellar models to precisely reproduce stellar envelope characteristics.
Light elements are burned at relatively low temperatures (from 2 to 5 MK) and thus in the evolutionary
stages of a star they are gradually destroyed at different depths of stellar interior, in dependence
on the stellar mass. Their surface abundances are strongly influenced by the nuclear cross sections,
by the extension of the convective envelope and by the temperature at its bottom, which depend on
the characteristics of the star (mass and chemical composition) as well as on the energy transport
in the convective stellar envelope. In recent years, a great effort has been made to improve the precision
of light element burning cross sections. However, theoretical predictions surface light element
abundance are challenging because they are also influenced by the uncertainties in the input physics
adopted in the calculations as well as the efficiency of several standard and non-standard physical
processes active in young stars (i.e. diffusion, radiative levitation, magnetic fields, rotation).
Moreover, it is still not completely clear how much the previous protostellar evolution affects
the characteristics of a stellar model and thus the light element depletion. This paper presents
the state-of-the-art of theoretical predictions for protostars and PMS stars, discussing the
role of several input physics on the stellar evolution.

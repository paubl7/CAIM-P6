A stochastic gravitational wave background (SGWB), created by the superposition of signals from
unresolved astrophysical sources, may be detected in the next few years. Estimating the variation
of intensity across the sky can, therefore, play a key role in improving our understanding of astrophysical
models. Skymaps have been produced for all the data-taking runs of the advanced ground-based interferometric
detectors. While these maps are being produced in pixel and SpH bases, to probe, respectively, localized
and diffuse astrophysical and cosmological sources, with algorithms that employ cross-correlation
as the common strategy, the underlying algebra and numerical implementation remain different.
As a consequence, there was a need for producing skymaps in both bases in those analyses. We show that
these manifestly redundant methods could indeed be unified to a single analysis that can probe very
different scales and demonstrate it by applying them on real data. We first develop the algebra to
show that the results in two different bases are easily transformable. We then incorporate both
the schemes in the now-standard analysis pipeline for anisotropic SGWB, PyStoch. This will enable
SGWB anisotropy searches in SpH basis also to take full advantage of integrated \hpx tools and makes
it computationally feasible to perform the search in every frequency bin. We, however, follow a
different approach for direct estimation of the SpH moments. We show that the results obtained from
these different methods match very well; the differences are less than $0.1$\% for the SpH moments
and less than $0.01$\% for the Fisher information matrices. Thus we conclude that a single skymap
will be sufficient to describe the anisotropies in a stochastic background. The multiple capabilities
of PyStoch will be useful for estimating and constraining various measures that characterize an
anisotropic background.

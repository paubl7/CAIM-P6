The Odin satellite is now into its twentieth year of operation, much surpassing its design life of
two years. One of its major pursuits was the search for and study of H2O in the Solar System and the Milky
Way galaxy. Herschel has observed the central region of NGC 1365 in two positions, and both its SPIRE
and PACS observations are available in the Herschel Science Archive. Herschel PACS images have
been produced of the 70 and 160 micron infrared emission from the whole galaxy, and also of the cold
dust distribution as obtained from the ratio of the 160 to 70 micron images. The Herschel SPIRE observations
have been used to produce maps of the 557 GHz o-H2O, 752 GHz p-H2O, 691 GHz CO(6-5), 1037 GHz CO(9-8),
537 GHz CH, 835 GHz CH+, and the 1461 GHz NII lines; however, these observations have no effective
velocity resolution. Odin has recently observed the 557 GHz o-H2O ground state line in the central
region with high (5 km/s) spectral resolution. The emission and absorption of H2O at 557 GHz, with
a velocity resolution of 5 km/s, has been marginally detected in NGC 1365 with Odin. The H2O is predominantly
located in a shocked 15" (1.3 kpc) region near some central compact radio sources and hot-spot HII
regions, close to the northeast component of the molecular torus surrounding the nucleus. An analysis
of the H2O line intensities and velocities indicates that a shock-region is located here. This is
corroborated by a statistical image deconvolution of our SEST CO(3-2) observations, yielding
5" resolution, and a study of our VLA HI absorption observations. Additionally, an enticing 20"
HI ridge is found to extend south-southeast from the nucleus, coinciding in position with the southern
edge of an OIII outflow cone, emanating from the nucleus. The molecular chemistry of the shocked
central region is analyzed with special emphasis on the CO, H2O and CH, CH+ results.

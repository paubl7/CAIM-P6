Debris disks are classically considered to be gas-less systems, but recent (sub)millimeter observations
have detected tens of those with rich gas content. The origin of the gas component remains unclear;
namely, it can be protoplanetary remnants and/or secondary products deriving from large bodies.
In order to be protoplanetary in origin, the gas component of the parental protoplanetary disk is
required to survive for $\gtrsim10{\,\rm Myr}$. However, previous models predict $\lesssim 10{\,\rm
Myr}$ lifetimes because of efficient photoevaporation at the late stage of disk evolution. In the
present study, we investigate photoevaporation of gas-rich, optically-thin disks around intermediate-mass
stars at a late stage of the disk evolution. The evolved system is modeled as those where radiation
force is sufficiently strong to continuously blow out small grains ($\lesssim 4 {\,\rm \mu m}$),
which are an essential component for driving photoevaporation via photoelectric heating induced
by stellar far-ultraviolet (FUV). We find that the grain depletion reduces photoelectric heating,
so that FUV photoevaporation is not excited. Extreme-ultraviolet (EUV) photoevaporation is dominant
and yields a mass-loss rate of $2$--$5\times10^{-10}(\Phi_{\rm EUV}/10^{41}{\,\rm s}^{-1})^{1/2}\,M_\odot\,{\rm
yr}^{-1}$, where $\Phi_{\rm EUV}$ is the EUV emission rate. The estimated lifetimes of the gas component
are $\sim 50 (M_{\rm disk}/10^{-2}\,M_\odot)(\Phi_{\rm EUV}/10^{41}\,{\rm s}^{-1})^{1/2}\,{\rm
Myr}$ and depend on the ``initial'' disk mass at the point small grains have been depleted in the system.
With an order estimation, we show that the gas component can survive for a much longer time around
A-type stars than lower-mass stars. This trend is consistent with the higher frequency of gas-rich
debris disks around A-type stars, implying the possibility of the gas component being protoplanetary
remnants.

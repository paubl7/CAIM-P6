Observations of massive stars in young open clusters (< ~8 Myr) have shown that a majority of them
are in binary systems, most of which will interact during their life. Populations of massive stars
older than ~20 Myr allow us to probe the outcome of such interactions after many systems have experienced
mass and angular momentum transfer. Using multi-epoch integral-field spectroscopy, we investigate
the multiplicity properties of the massive-star population in NGC 330 (~40 Myr) in the Small Magellanic
Cloud to search for imprints of stellar evolution on the multiplicity properties. From six epochs
of VLT/MUSE observations supported by adaptive optics we extract spectra and measure radial velocities
for stars brighter than F814W = 19. We identify single-lined spectroscopic binaries through significant
RV variability as well as double-lined spectroscopic binaries, and quantify the observational
biases for binary detection. The observed spectroscopic binary fraction is 13.2+/-2.0 %. Considering
period and mass ratio ranges from log(P)=0.15-3.5, and q = 0.1-1.0, and a representative set of orbital
parameter distributions, we find a bias-corrected close binary fraction of 34 +8 -7 %. This seems
to decline for the fainter stars, which indicates either that the close binary fraction drops in
the B-type domain, or that the period distribution becomes more heavily weighted towards longer
orbital periods. Both fractions vary strongly in different regions of the color-magnitude diagram
which probably reveals the imprint of the binary history of different groups of stars. We provide
the first homogeneous RV study of a large sample of B-type stars at a low metallicity. The overall
bias-corrected close binary fraction of B stars in NGC 330 is lower than the one reported for younger
Galactic and LMC clusters. More data are needed to establish whether this result from an age or a metallicty
effect.

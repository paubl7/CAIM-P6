Developing analysis pipelines based on statistics beyond two-point functions is critical for
extracting a maximal amount of cosmological information from current and upcoming weak lensing
surveys. In this paper, we study the impact of the intrinsic alignment of galaxies (IA) on three promising
probes measured from aperture mass maps -- the lensing peaks, minima and full PDF, in comparison
and in combination with the shear two-point correlation functions ($\gamma$-2PCFs). Our two-dimensional
IA infusion method converts the light-cone-projected mass sheets into projected tidal tensors,
which are then linearly coupled to an intrinsic ellipticity component with a strength controlled
by the coupling parameter $A_{\rm IA}$. We validate our method with the $\gamma$-2PCFs statistics,
recovering well the analytical calculations from the linear alignment model of \citet{BridleKing}
in a full tomographic setting, and for different $A_{\rm IA}$ values. We next use our method to infuse
at the galaxy catalogue level a non-linear IA model that includes the density-weighting term introduced
in \citet{Blazek2015}, and compute the impact on the three aperture mass map statistics. We find
that large \snr peaks are maximally affected, with deviations reaching 30\% (10\%) for a {\it Euclid}-like
(KiDS-like) survey. Modelling the signal in a $w$CDM cosmology universe with $N$-body simulations,
we forecast the cosmological bias caused by unmodelled IA for 100 deg$^2$ of {\it Euclid}-like data,
finding very large offsets in $w_0$ (5-10$\sigma_{\rm stat}$), $\Omega_{\rm m}$ (4-6$\sigma_{\rm
stat}$), and $S_8 \equiv \sigma_8\sqrt{\Omega_{\rm m}/0.3}$ ($\sim$3$\sigma_{\rm stat}$).
The method presented in this paper offers a compelling avenue to account for IA in beyond-two-point
weak lensing statistics, with a flexibility comparable to that of current $\gamma$-2PCFs IA analytical
models.

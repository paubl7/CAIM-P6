Pulsars show a steady decrease in their rotational frequency, occasionally interrupted by sudden
spin-ups called glitches, whose physical origin is still a mystery. One suggested explanation
for at least the small glitches are starquakes, i.e., failures of the solid neutron star crust, in
which the progressive reduction of the centrifugal force deforms the star, stressing the solid
until it breaks. This produces a spin-up, dissipating energy inside the star. We explore this suggestion
by analyzing a mostly analytical model in order to understand the possible consequences of starquakes,
particularly whether they can explain at least the small glitches. We analyze the deformations
and strains produced by the decreasing centrifugal force, modeling the neutron star with a fluid
core and a solid crust, each with uniform density and with the core possibly denser than the crust.
The deformation of a star with very different densities in the core and crust is qualitatively different
from the previously studied case of equal densities. The former more closely resembles the behavior
of a fluid star, in which the core-crust interface is a surface of constant gravitational plus centrifugal
potential. Regardless of the uncertain breaking strain, the glitch activity in this model is several
orders of magnitude smaller than observed, even if only small glitches are considered. For a large
breaking strain, suggested by simulations, glitches due to starquakes could be roughly of the correct
size, but much less frequent than observed glitches. The energy released in each such glitch is much
larger than in the standard model of angular momentum transfer from a faster rotating superfluid
in the inner crust. We also confirm that stresses in the crust can in principle support an ellipticity
much larger than some observational upper limits from pulsar timing and continuous gravitational
wave searches.

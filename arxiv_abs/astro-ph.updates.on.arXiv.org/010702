Dark matter search experiments demand low to ultralow radiation background to operate. It is very
important to understand the nature of the radiation background including knowledge about the sources
contributing to it. Sometimes, evaluation of the background becomes very specific to the site chosen
for the experiment, and also to the experimental configuration. A dark matter search experiment
is proposed to be set up at the Jaduguda Underground Science Laboratory (JUSL) in India. The laboratory
will be located inside an existing mine with 555 m of vertical rock overburden. Neutrons produced
from $(\alpha,n)$ reactions, spontaneous fission of natural radioactive impurities in the rocks,
and also from cosmic muon induced reactions are considered as the main background which can affect
the sensitivity and outcome of the experiment. In this work, simulations based on GEANT4 are done
to understand both the radiogenic neutron background caused by natural radioactivity of the surrounding
rock and the cosmogenic neutron background due to interaction of the deeply penetrating cosmic
muons with the rock. The muon flux in the cavern is obtained to be $4.49(\pm0.25)\times10^{-7} $cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$
and the fluxes of radiogenic and cosmogenic neutrons above an energy threshold of 1 MeV in the cavern
are obtained to be $5.75(\pm0.58)\times10^{-6}$cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ and $7.25(\pm0.65)\times
10^{-9}$ cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$ respectively. The values obtained are comparable with estimates
and measurements done for DAMA, WIPP and dark matter experiments at Boulby mine. The effectiveness
of different shielding materials are also investigated to obtain the best possible neutron background
reduction for a dark matter search experiment at JUSL. We also estimate the sensitivity of a CsI based
detector for Weakly Interacting Massive Particle (WIMP) dark matter search at JUSL considering
the estimated neutron background.

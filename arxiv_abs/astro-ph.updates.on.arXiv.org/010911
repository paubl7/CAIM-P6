We consider the effect on Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) of new measurements of the $d(p,\gamma){}^3$He
cross section by the LUNA Collaboration. These have an important effect on the primordial abundance
of D/H which is also sensitive to the baryon density at the time of BBN. We have re-evaluated the thermal
rate for this reaction, using a world average of cross section data, which we describe with model-independent
polynomials; our results are in good agreement with a similar analysis by LUNA. We then perform a
full likelihood analysis combining BBN and Planck cosmic microwave background (CMB) likelihood
chains using the new rate combined with previous measurements and compare with the results using
previous rates. Concordance between BBN and CMB measurements of the anisotropy spectrum using
the old rates was excellent. The predicted deuterium abundance at the Planck value of the baryon
density was $({\rm D/H})_{\rm BBN+CMB}^{\rm old} = (2.57 \pm 0.13) \times 10^{-5}$ which can be
compared with the value determined from quasar absorption systems $({\rm D/H})_{\rm obs} = (2.55
\pm 0.03) \times 10^{-5} $. Using the new rates we find $({\rm D/H})_{\rm BBN+CMB} = (2.51 \pm 0.11)
\times 10^{-5}$. We thus find consistency among BBN theory, deuterium and ${}^4$He observations,
and the CMB, when using reaction rates fit in our data-driven approach. We also find that the new reaction
data tightens the constraints on the number of relativistic degrees of freedom during BBN, giving
the effective number of light neutrino species $N_\nu = 2.880 \pm 0.144$ in good agreement with the
Standard Model of particle physics. Finally, we note that the observed deuterium abundance continues
to be more precise than the BBN+CMB prediction, whose error budget is now dominated by $d(d,n){}^3$He
and $d(d,p){}^{3}{\rm H}$.

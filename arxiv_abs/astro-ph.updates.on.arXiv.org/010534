Class III stars are those in star forming regions without large non-photospheric infrared emission,
suggesting recent dispersal of their protoplanetary disks. We observed 30 class III stars in the
1-3 Myr Lupus region with ALMA at ${\sim}856\mu$m, resulting in 4 detections that we attribute to
circumstellar dust. Inferred dust masses are $0.036{-}0.093M_\oplus$, ${\sim}1$ order of magnitude
lower than any previous measurements; one disk is resolved with radius ${\sim}80$ au. Two class
II sources in the field of view were also detected, and 11 other sources, consistent with sub-mm galaxy
number counts. Stacking non-detections yields a marginal detection with mean dust mass ${\sim}0.0048M_\oplus$.
We searched for gas emission from the CO J=3-2 line, and present its detection to NO Lup inferring
a gas mass ($4.9 {\pm} 1.1$) ${\times}10^{-5} M_\oplus$ and gas-to-dust ratio $1.0{\pm}0.4$.
Combining our survey with class II sources shows a gap in the disk mass distribution from $0.09{-}2M_\oplus$
for ${>}0.7M_\odot$ Lupus stars, evidence of rapid dispersal of mm-sized dust from protoplanetary
disks. The class III disk mass distribution is consistent with a population model of planetesimal
belts that go on to replenish the debris disks seen around main sequence stars. This suggests that
planetesimal belt formation does not require long-lived protoplanetary disks, i.e., planetesimals
form within ${\sim}$2 Myr. While all 4 class III disks are consistent with collisional replenishment,
for two the gas and/or mid-IR emission could indicate primordial circumstellar material in the
final stages of protoplanetary disk dispersal. Two class III stars without sub-mm detections exhibit
hot emission that could arise from ongoing planet formation processes inside ${\sim}1$ au.

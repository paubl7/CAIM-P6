It is well-known that feedback processes play a fundamental role in the regulation of star formation
(SF) and, in particular, in the quenching of early-type galaxies (ETGs) as have been inferred by
numerical studies of LambdaCDM universe models. At the same time, ETGs are subject to certain fundamental
scaling relations, but the connection between them and the physical processes that effect ETG evolution
remain unknown. This work aims at studying the impact of the energetic feedback due to active galactic
nuclei (AGN) in the formation and evolution of ETGs. Especially, we assess to what extent modelling
AGN feedback is necessary to reproduce observational constrains such as morphology, kinematics
and the evolution of the main scaling relations. The Horizon-AGN and Horizon-noAGN cosmological
hydrodynamical simulations were performed with identical initial conditions and including the
same physical processes with the exception of the AGN feedback in the former. We select a sample of
ETGs from both simulations using the same criteria and subject them to an exhaustive study regarding
SF activity, kinematics and scaling relations. We find that galaxies from Horizon-AGN follow observed
fundamental scaling relations (mass-plane, Fundamental Plane, mass-size relation) and reproduce,
qualitatively, kinematic features such as the bimodality in the spin parameter distribution at
z = 0. The specific star formation activity is within observed ranges when AGN is turned on. Instead,
galaxies formed in absence of AGN feedback show differences with observations such as the departure
from the Fundamental Plane (FP) of a group of galaxies that have an excess of stellar surface density,
and a shallower mass-size relation populated by galaxies with young stellar ages. Abridged

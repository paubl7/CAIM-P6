We present an overview of the Middle Ages Galaxy Properties with Integral Field Spectroscopy (MAGPI)
survey, a Large Program on ESO/VLT. MAGPI is designed to study the physical drivers of galaxy transformation
at a lookback time of 3-4 Gyr, during which the dynamical, morphological, and chemical properties
of galaxies are predicted to evolve significantly. The survey uses new medium-deep adaptive optics
aided MUSE observations of fields selected from the GAMA survey, providing a wealth of publicly
available ancillary multi-wavelength data. With these data, MAGPI will map the kinematic and chemical
properties of stars and ionised gas for a sample of 60 massive (> 7 x 10^10 M_Sun) central galaxies
at 0.25 < z <0.35 in a representative range of environments (isolated, groups and clusters). The
spatial resolution delivered by MUSE with Ground Layer Adaptive Optics (GLAO, 0.6-0.8 arcsec FWHM)
will facilitate a direct comparison with Integral Field Spectroscopy surveys of the nearby Universe,
such as SAMI and MaNGA, and at higher redshifts using adaptive optics, e.g. SINS. In addition to the
primary (central) galaxy sample, MAGPI will deliver resolved and unresolved spectra for as many
as 150 satellite galaxies at 0.25 < z <0.35, as well as hundreds of emission-line sources at z < 6. This
paper outlines the science goals, survey design, and observing strategy of MAGPI. We also present
a first look at the MAGPI data, and the theoretical framework to which MAGPI data will be compared
using the current generation of cosmological hydrodynamical simulations including EAGLE, Magneticum,
HORIZON-AGN, and Illustris-TNG. Our results show that cosmological hydrodynamical simulations
make discrepant predictions in the spatially resolved properties of galaxies at z ~ 0.3. MAGPI observations
will place new constraints and allow for tangible improvements in galaxy formation theory.

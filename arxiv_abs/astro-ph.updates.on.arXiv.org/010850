Star formation has long been known to be an inefficient process, in the sense that only a small fraction
$\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ of the mass of any given gas cloud is converted to stars per cloud free-fall time.
However, developing a successful theory of star formation will require measurements of both the
mean value of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$ and its scatter from one molecular cloud to another. Because $\epsilon_{\rm
ff}$ is measured relative to the free-fall time, such measurements require accurate determinations
of cloud volume densities. Efforts to measure the volume density from 2D projected data, however,
have thus far relied on treating molecular clouds as simple uniform spheres, while their real shapes
are likely filamentary and their density distributions far from uniform. The resulting uncertainty
in the true volume density is likely one of the major sources of error in observational estimates
of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$. In this paper, we use a suite of simulations of star-forming clouds to examine
whether it is possible to obtain more accurate volume density estimates and thereby reduce this
error. We create mock observations from the simulations, and show that current methods relying
on the spherical assumption likely yield ~ 0.5 dex errors in volume density estimates, corresponding
to a ~ 0.25 dex scatter in $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$, comparable to the scatter in observed cloud samples.
We build a predictive model that uses information accessible in 2D measurements -- most significantly
the Gini coefficient of the surface density distribution -- to produce estimates of the volume density
with ~ 0.2-0.3 dex less scatter. Application of this model to observational estimates of $\epsilon_{\rm
ff}$ should greatly reduce one of the largest sources of error, and allow significantly more accurate
determinations of its true mean value and scatter of $\epsilon_{\rm ff}$.

Equilibrium sequences were developed for rotating NS in the relativistic mean-field interaction
framework using four density-dependent equations of state for the NS matter. These sequences were
constructed for the observed rotation frequencies of 25, 317, 346, 716, and 1122 Hz. The bounds of
sequences were calculated in each model to determine the stability region. The gravitational mass,
quadrupole moment, polar, forward and backward redshifts, and Kerr parameter were calculated.
DDF and DD-ME$\delta$ were unable to properly describe the low-frequency neutron stars, PSR J0348+432,
PSR J1614-2230 , and PSR J0740+6620 rotate at a frequency of 25, 317, and 346 Hz, respectively. All
the selected EOSs properly described the rotation of PSR J1748-244ad, and PSR J1739-285 at a frequency
of 716 and 1122 Hz, respectively. The mass of these stars was in the range of [0.68, 2.14]M$_{\odot}$
and [1.67, 2.24]M$_{\odot}$, respectively. The polar, forward and backward redshifts, and the
quadrupole moment were calculated in all selected rotating frequencies and the Keplerian sequence.
The results were consistent with observations. Confirming the mass of $1.5^{+0.4}_{-1.0}M_{\odot}$
for EXO 0748-676, our result will be close to the observed value, and the EOSs used in this study properly
describe this star. The extremum of Kerr parameter, polar, forward and backward redshifts in all
models reached constant values of, a/M$\approx$ 0.7, Z$_{p}\approx$ 0.8, Z$_{eq}^{f}\approx$
-0.3 and Z$_{eq}^{b}\approx$ 2.2. These behaviors of redshifts and Kerr parameter are approximately
independent of EOS. The observed behaviors must evaluate by other EOSs to find universal relations
for these quantities. Also, a limit value was found for each of these parameters. In this case where
these parameters are greater than the limit value, the star can rotate at a frequency equal to or greater
than $\nu$= 1122 Hz.

We present fundamental parameters for 110 canonical K- & M-type (1.3$-$0.13$M_\odot$) Taurus-Auriga
young stellar objects (YSOs). The analysis produces a simultaneous determination of effective
temperature ($T_{\rm eff}$), surface gravity ($\log$ g), magnetic field strength (B), and projected
rotational velocity ($v \sin i$). Our method employed synthetic spectra and high-resolution (R$\sim$45,000)
near-infrared spectra taken with the Immersion GRating INfrared Spectrometer (IGRINS) to fit
specific K-band spectral regions most sensitive to those parameters. The use of these high-resolution
spectra reduces the influence of distance uncertainties, reddening, and non-photospheric continuum
emission on the parameter determinations. The median total (fit + systematic) uncertainties were
170 K, 0.28 dex, 0.60 kG, 2.5 km s$^{-1}$ for $T_{\rm eff}$, $\log$ g, B, and $v \sin i$, respectively.
We determined B for 41 Taurus YSOs (upper limits for the remainder) and find systematic offsets (lower
$T_{\rm eff}$, higher $\log$ g and $v \sin i$) in parameters when B is measurable but not considered
in the fit. The average $\log$ g for the Class II and Class III objects differs by 0.23$\pm$0.05dex,
which is consistent with Class III objects being the more evolved members of the star-forming region.
However, the dispersion in $\log$ g is greater than the uncertainties, which highlights how the
YSO classification correlates with age ($\log$ g), yet there are exceptionally young (lower $\log$
g) Class III YSOs and relatively old (higher $\log$ g) Class II YSOs with unexplained evolutionary
histories. The spectra from this work are provided in an online repository along with TW Hydrae Association
(TWA) comparison objects and the model grid used in our analysis.

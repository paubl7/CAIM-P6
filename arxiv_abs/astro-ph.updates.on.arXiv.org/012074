Models of chemical enrichment and inhomogeneity in high-redshift galaxies are challenging to
constrain observationally. In this work, we discuss a novel approach to probe chemical inhomogeneities
within long Gamma-Ray Burst (GRB) host galaxies, by comparing the absorption metallicity, Z_abs,
from the GRB afterglow (which probes the environment along the line of sight) with the emission-line
metallicity, Z_emiss, measured via slit spectroscopy. Using the IllustrisTNG simulation, the
theoretical relationship between these metallicity metrics is explored for a range of GRB formation
models, varying the GRB progenitor metallicity threshold. For galaxies with fixed Z_emiss, the
median value of Z_abs depends strongly on the GRB progenitor threshold metallicity, with Z_abs
significantly lower than Z_emiss for high metallicity hosts. Conversely, at fixed Z_abs, the median
value of Z_emiss depends primarily on the metallicity distribution of galaxies in IllustrisTNG
and their chemical inhomogeneities, offering a GRB-model-independent way to constrain these
processes observationally. Currently, only one host galaxy has data for both absorption and emission
metallicities (GRB121014A). We re-analyse the emission spectrum and compare the inferred metallicity
Z_emiss to a recent Bayesian determination of Z_abs, finding $\log(Z_{\rm emiss}/Z_{\odot})
= \log(Z_{\rm abs}/Z_{\odot}) +0.35^{+ 0.14}_{- 0.25}$, within ~2 standard deviations of predictions
from the IllustrisTNG simulation. Future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope will
be able to measure Z_emiss for 4 other GRB hosts with known Z_abs values, using ~2 hour observations.
While small, the sample will provide preliminary constraints on the Z_abs-Z_emiss relation to
test chemical enrichment schemes in cosmological simulations.

We present stationary solutions of geometrically thick discs (or tori) endowed with a self-consistent
toroidal magnetic field distribution surrounding a non-rotating black hole in an analytical,
static, spherically-symmetric $f(R)$-gravity background. These $f(R)$-gravity models introduce
a Yukawa-like modification to the Newtonian potential, encoded in a single parameter $\delta$
which controls the strength of the modified potential and whose specific values affect the disc
configurations when compared to the general relativistic case. Our models span different magnetic
field strengths, from purely hydrodynamical discs to highly magnetized tori. The characteristics
of the solutions are identified by analyzing the central density, mass, geometrical size, angular
size, and the black hole metric deviations from the Schwarzschild space-time. In the general relativistic
limit ($\delta=0$) our models reproduce previous results for a Schwarzschild black hole. For small
values of the $\delta$ parameter, corresponding to $\sim 10\%$ deviations from general relativity,
we find variations of $\sim 2 \%$ in the event horizon size, a $\sim 5\%$ shift in the location of the
inner edge and center of the disc, while the outer edge increases by $\sim 10\%$. Our analysis for
$|\delta|>0.1$, however, reveals notable changes in the black hole space-time solution which
have a major impact in the morphological and thermodynamical properties of the discs. The comparison
with general relativity is further investigated by computing the size of the photon ring produced
by a source located at infinity. This allows us to place constraints on the parameters of the $f(R)$-gravity
model based on the Event Horizon Telescope observations of the size of the light ring in M87 and SgrA$^*$.

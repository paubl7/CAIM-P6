The microquasar MAXI J\(1820+070\) went into outburst from mid-March until mid-July 2018 with
several faint rebrightenings afterwards. With a peak flux of approximately 4 Crab in the \(20-50\)
keV, energy range the source was monitored across the electromagnetic spectrum with detections
from radio to hard X-ray frequencies. Using these multi-wavelength observations, we analyzed
quasi-simultaneous observations from 12 April, near the peak of the outburst (\(\sim 23\) March).
Spectral analysis of the hard X-rays found a \(kT_e \sim 30 \) keV and \( \tau \sim 2\) with a \texttt{CompTT}
model, indicative of an accreting black hole binary in the hard state. The flat/inverted radio spectrum
and the accretion disk winds seen at optical wavelengths are also consistent with the hard state.
Then we constructed a spectral energy distribution spanning \(\sim 12\) orders of magnitude using
modelling in \texttt{JetSeT}. The model is composed of an irradiated disk with a Compton hump and
a leptonic jet with an acceleration region and a synchrotron-dominated cooling region. \texttt{JetSeT}
finds the spectrum is dominated by jet emission up to approximately \(10^{14}\) Hz after which disk
and coronal emission dominate. The acceleration region has a magnetic field of \( B \sim 1.6 \times
10^4 \) G, a cross section of \(R \sim 2.8 \times 10^{9} \) cm, and a flat radio spectral shape naturally
obtained from the synchroton cooling of the accelerated electrons. The jet luminosity of \(> 8 \times
10^{37} \) erg/s (\(> 0.15L_{Edd}\)) compared to an accretion luminosity of \( \sim 6 \times 10^{37}\)
erg/s, assuming a distance of 3 kpc. Because these two values are comparable, it is possible the jet
is powered predominately via accretion with only a small contribution needed from the Blanford-Znajek
mechanism from the reportedly slowly spinning black hole.

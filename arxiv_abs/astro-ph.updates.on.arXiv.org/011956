Gravitational wave (GW) detections have enriched our understanding of the universe. To date, all
single-source GW events were found by interferometer-type detectors. We study a detection method
using astrometric solutions from photometric surveys and demonstrate that it offers a highly flexible
frequency range, uniquely complementing existing detection methods. From repeated point-source
astrometric measurements, we may extract GW-induced deflections and infer wave parameters. This
method can be applied to any photometric surveys measuring relative astrometry. We show that high-cadence
observations of the galactic bulge, such as offered by the Roman Space Telescope's Exoplanet MicroLensing
(EML) survey, can be a potent GW probe with complementary frequency range to Gaia, pulsar timing
arrays (PTAs), and the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA). We calculate that the Roman EML
survey is sensitive to GWs with frequencies ranging from $7.7\times10^{-8}$Hz to $5.6\times10^{-4}$Hz,
which opens up a unique GW observing window for supermassive black hole binaries and their waveform
evolution. While the detection threshold assuming the currently expected performance proves
too high for detecting individual GWs in light of the expected supermassive black hole binary population
distribution, we show that binaries with chirp mass $M_c>10^{8.3}~M_\odot$ out to 100 Mpc can be
detected if the telescope is able to achieve an astrometric accuracy of 0.11 mas. To confidently
detect binaries with $M_c>10^{7}~M_\odot$ out to 50 Mpc, a factor of 100 sensitivity improvement
is required. We propose several improvement strategies, including recovering the mean astrometric
deflection and increasing astrometric accuracy, number of observed stars, field-of-view size,
and observational cadence. We discuss how other existing and planned photometric surveys could
contribute to detecting GWs via astrometry.

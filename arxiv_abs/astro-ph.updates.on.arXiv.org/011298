Both Earth and Mars host populations of co-orbital minor bodies. A large number of present-day Mars
co-orbitals is probably associated with the fission of the parent body of Mars Trojan 5261 Eureka
(1990 MB) during a rotation-induced YORP break-up event. Here, we use the statistical distributions
of the Tisserand parameter and the relative mean longitude of Mars co-orbitals with eccentricity
below 0.2 to estimate the importance of rotation-induced YORP break-up events in Martian co-orbital
space. Machine-learning techniques (k-means++ and agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms)
are applied to assess our findings. Our statistical analysis identified three new Mars Trojans:
2009 SE, 2018 EC4 and 2018 FC4. Two of them, 2018 EC4 and 2018 FC4, are probably linked to Eureka but
we argue that 2009 SE may have been captured, so it is not related to Eureka. We also suggest that 2020
VT1, a recent discovery, is a transient Martian co-orbital of the horseshoe type. When applied to
Earth co-orbital candidates with eccentricity below 0.2, our approach led us to identify some clustering,
perhaps linked to fission events. The cluster with most members could be associated with Earth quasi-satellite
469219 Kamo`oalewa (2016 HO3) that is a fast rotator. Our statistical analysis identified two new
Earth co-orbitals: 2020 PN1, that follows a horseshoe path, and 2020 PP1, a quasi-satellite that
is dynamically similar to Kamo`oalewa. For both Mars and Earth co-orbitals, we found pairs of objects
whose values of the Tisserand parameter differ by very small amounts, perhaps hinting at recent
disruption events. Clustering algorithms and numerical simulations both suggest that 2020 KZ2
and Kamo`oalewa could be related.

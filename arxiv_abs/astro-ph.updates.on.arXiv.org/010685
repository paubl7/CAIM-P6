Focusing on both small separations and Baryonic Acoustic Oscillation scales, the cosmic evolution
of the clustering properties of peak, void, wall, and filament-type critical points is measured
using two-point correlation functions in $\Lambda$CDM dark matter simulations as a function of
their relative rarity. A qualitative comparison to the corresponding theory for Gaussian Random
fields allows us to understand the following observed features: i) the appearance of an exclusion
zone at small separation, whose size depends both on rarity and on the signature (\ie the number of
negative eigenvalues) of the critical points involved; ii) the amplification of the Baryonic Acoustic
Oscillation bump with rarity and its reversal for cross-correlations involving negatively biased
critical points; iii) the orientation-dependent small-separation divergence of the cross-correlations
of peaks and filaments (voids and walls) which reflects the relative loci of such points in the filament's
(wall's) eigenframe. The most significant features of the correlations are tabulated. The (cross-)
correlations involving the most non-linear critical points (peaks, voids) display significant
variation with redshift, while those involving less non-linear critical points seem mostly insensitive
to redshift evolution, which should prove advantageous to model. The relative distances to the
maxima of the peak-to-wall and peak-to-void over that of the peak-to-filament cross-correlation
are in ratios of $\sim\sqrt{2}$ and $\sim\sqrt{3}$, respectively which could be interpreted as
an indication of the cosmic crystal being on average close to a cubic lattice. The insensitivity
to redshift evolution suggests that the absolute and relative clustering of critical points could
become a topologically robust alternative to standard clustering techniques when analyzing upcoming
large scale surveys such as Euclid or LSST.

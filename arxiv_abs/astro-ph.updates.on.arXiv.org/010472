We report on the results of a new spectroscopic monitoring campaign of the quasar PG 0026+129 at the
Calar Alto Observatory 2.2m telescope from July 2017 to February 2020. Significant variations
in the fluxes of the continuum and broad-emission lines, including H$\beta$ and He II, were observed
in the first and third years, and clear time lags between them are measured. The broad H$\beta$ line
profile consists of two Gaussian components: an intermediate-width H$\beta_{\rm IC}$ with a full
width at half-maximum (FWHM) of 1964$\pm$18 $\rm km~s^{-1}$ and another very broad H$\beta_{\rm
VBC}$ with a FWHM of 7570$\pm$83 $\rm km~s^{-1}$. H$\beta_{\rm IC}$ has long time lags of $\sim$40--60
days in the rest frame, while H$\beta_{\rm VBC}$ shows nearly zero time delay with respect to the
optical continuum at 5100 \AA. The velocity-resolved delays show consistent results: lags of $\sim$30--50
days at the core of the broad H$\beta$ line and roughly zero lags at the wings. H$\beta_{\rm IC}$ has
a redshift of $\sim$400 $\rm km~s^{-1}$ which seems to be stable for nearly 30 years by comparing
with archived spectra, and may originate from an infall. The root mean square (rms) spectrum of H$\beta_{\rm
VBC}$ shows a double-peaked profile with brighter blue peak and extended red wing in the first year,
which matches the signature of a thin disk. Both the double-peaked profile and the near-zero lag
suggest that H$\beta_{\rm VBC}$ comes from a region associated with the part of the accretion disc
that emits the optical continuum. Adopting the FWHM (in the rms spectrum) and the time lag measured
for the total H$\beta$ line, and a virial factor of 1.5, we obtain a virial mass of $2.89_{-0.69}^{+0.60}
\times10^7 M_{\odot}$ for the central black hole in this quasar.

Neutron star mergers (NSMs) are promising astrophysical sites for the rapid neutron-capture ("$r$-")
process, but can their integrated yields explain the majority of heavy-element material in the
Galaxy? One method to address this question has utilized a forward approach that propagates NSM
rates and yields along with stellar formation rates, in the end comparing those results with observed
chemical abundances of $r$-process-rich, metal-poor stars. In this work, we take the inverse approach
by utilizing $r$-process-element abundance ratios of metal-poor stars as input to reconstruct
the properties---especially the masses---of the neutron star (NS) binary progenitors of the $r$-process
stars. This novel analysis provides an independent avenue for studying the population of the original
neutron star binary systems that merged and produced the $r$-process material incorporated in
Galactic metal-poor halo stars. We use ratios of elements typically associated with the limited-$r$
process and the actinide region to those in the lanthanide region (i.e., Zr/Dy and Th/Dy) to probe
the NS masses of the progenitor merger. We find that NSMs can account for all $r$-process material
in metal-poor stars that display $r$-process signatures, while simultaneously reproducing the
present-day distribution of double-NS (DNS) systems. However, the most $r$-process enhanced
stars (the $r$-II stars) on their own would require progenitor NSMs of very asymmetric systems that
are distinctly different from present ones in the Galaxy. As this analysis is model-dependent,
we also explore variations in line with future expectation regarding potential theoretical and
observational updates, and comment on how these variations impact our results.

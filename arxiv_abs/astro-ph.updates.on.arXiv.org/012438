Weak gravitational lensing mass maps play a crucial role in understanding the evolution of structures
in the universe and our ability to constrain cosmological models. The prediction of these mass maps
is based on expensive N-body simulations, which can create a computational bottleneck for cosmological
analyses. Modern deep generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), have
demonstrated their potential to achieve this goal. Most existing GAN approaches produce simulations
for a fixed value of the cosmological parameters, which limits their practical applicability.
We propose a novel conditional GAN model that is able to generate mass maps for any pair of matter density
$\Omega_m$ and matter clustering strength $\sigma_8$, parameters which have the largest impact
on the evolution of structures in the universe. Our results show that our conditional GAN can interpolate
efficiently within the space of simulated cosmologies, and generate maps anywhere inside this
space with good visual quality high statistical accuracy. We perform an extensive quantitative
comparison of the N-body and GAN -generated maps using a range of metrics: the pixel histograms,
peak counts, power spectra, bispectra, Minkowski functionals, correlation matrices of the power
spectra, the Multi-Scale Structural Similarity Index (MS-SSIM) and our equivalent of the Fr\'echet
Inception Distance (FID). We find a very good agreement on these metrics, with typical differences
are <5% at the centre of the simulation grid, and slightly worse for cosmologies at the grid edges.
The agreement for the bispectrum is slightly worse, on the <20% level. This contribution is a step
towards building emulators of mass maps directly, capturing both the cosmological signal and its
variability. We make the code and the data publicly available: https://renkulab.io/gitlab/nathanael.perraudin/darkmattergan

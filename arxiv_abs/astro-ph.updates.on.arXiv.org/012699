Recently, the radius of neutron star (NS) PSR J0740+6620 was measured by NICER and an updated measurement
of neutron skin thickness of ${}^{208}$Pb ($R_{\rm skin}^{208}$) was reported by the PREX-II experiment.
These new measurements can help us better understand the unknown equation of state (EoS) of dense
matter. In this work, we adopt a hybrid parameterization method, which incorporates the nuclear
empirical parameterization and some widely used phenomenological parameterizations, to analyze
the results of nuclear experiments and astrophysical observations. With the joint Bayesian analysis
of GW170817, PSR J0030+0451, and PSR J0740+6620, the parameters that characterize the ultra dense
matter EoS are constrained. We find that the slope parameter $L$ is approximately constrained to
$70_{-18}^{+21}$ MeV, which predicts $R_{\rm skin}^{208}=0.204^{+0.030}_{-0.026}\,{\rm
fm}$ by using the universal relation between $R_{\rm skin}^{208}$ and $L$. And the bulk properties
of canonical $1.4\,M_\odot$ NS (e.g., $R_{1.4}$ and $\Lambda_{1.4}$) as well as the pressure ($P_{2\rho_{\rm
sat}}$) at two times the nuclear saturation density are well constrained by the data, i.e., $R_{1.4}$,
$\Lambda_{1.4}$, and $P_{2\rho_{\rm sat}}$ are approximately constrained to $12.3\pm0.7$ km,
$330_{-100}^{+140}$, and $4.1_{-1.2}^{+1.5}\times10^{34}\,{\rm dyn\,cm^{-2}}$, respectively.
Besides, we find that the Bayes evidences of the hybrid star and normal NS assumptions are comparable,
which indicates that current observation data are compatible with quarkyonic matter existing
in the core of massive star. Finally, in the case of normal NS assumption, we obtain a constraint for
the maximum mass of nonrotating NS $M_{\rm TOV}=2.30^{+0.30}_{-0.18}$ $M_\odot$. All of the uncertainties
reported above are for 68.3% credible levels.

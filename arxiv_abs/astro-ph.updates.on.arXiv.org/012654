Jets and outflows are thought to play important roles in regulating star formation and disk evolution.
HD 163296 is a well-studied Herbig Ae star that hosts proto-planet candidates, a protoplanetary
disk, a protostellar jet, and a molecular outflow, which makes it an excellent laboratory for studying
jets. We aim to characterize the jet at the inner regions and check if there are large differences
with the features at large separations. A secondary objective is to demonstrate the performance
of Multi Unit Spectroscopic Explorer (MUSE) in high-contrast imaging of extended line emission.
MUSE in the narrow field mode (NFM) can provide observations at optical wavelengths with high spatial
($\sim$75 mas) and medium spectral ($R\sim$2500) resolution. With the high-resolution spectral
differential imaging (HRSDI) technique, we can characterize the kinematic structures and physical
conditions of jets down to 100 mas. We detect multiple atomic lines in two new knots, B3 and A4, at distances
of <4" from the host star with MUSE. The derived $\dot{M}_{\rm jet} / \dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ is about
0.08 and 0.06 for knots B3 and A4, respectively. The observed [Ca II]/[S II] ratios indicate that
there is no sign of dust grains at distances of <4". Assuming the knot A4 traces the streamline, we
set an upper limit of 2.2 au on the size of the launching region. Although MUSE has the ability to detect
the velocity shifts caused by high- and low-velocity components, we found no significant evidence
of velocity decrease transverse to the jet direction. Our work demonstrates the capability of using
MUSE NFM observations for the detailed study of stellar jets in the optical down to 100~mas. The derived
$\dot{M}_{\rm jet} / \dot{M}_{\rm acc}$, no dust grain, and jet radius at the star support the magneto-centrifugal
models as a launching mechanism for the jet.

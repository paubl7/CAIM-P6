The relationship between a galaxy's properties and its circumgalactic medium (CGM) provides a
unique view of how galaxies evolve. We present an interesting edge-on (i=86 degrees) disk galaxy
(G1547) where the CGM is probed by a background quasar at a distance of 84 kpc and within 10 degrees
of the galaxy major axis. G1547 does not have any detectable CGM absorption down to stringent limits,
covering HI (EW$_r$<0.02A, log(N(HI)/cm$^{-2}$)<12.6) and a range of low and high ionisation
absorption lines (OI, CII, NII, SiII, CIII, NIII, SiIII, CIV, SiIV, NV and OVI). This system is rare,
given the covering fraction of $1.00_{-0.04}^{+0.00}$ for sub-L* galaxies within 50-100 kpc of
quasar sightlines. G1547 has a low SFR (1.1 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$), SSFR ($1.5\times10^{-10}$yr$^{-1}$)
and $\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ (0.06 M$_{\odot}$yr$^{-1}$kpc$^{-2}$) and does not exhibit AGN or star-formation
driven outflows. Compared to the general population of galaxies, G1547 is in the green valley and
has an above average metallicity with a negative gradient. When compared to other HI absorption-selected
galaxies, we find that quiescent galaxies with log(SSFR/yr$^{-1})<-11$ have a low probability
(4/12) of possessing detectable HI in their CGM, while all galaxies (40/40) with log(SSFR/yr$^{-1})>-11$
have HI absorption. We conclude that SSFR is a good indicator of the presence of HI CGM. Interestingly
however, G1547 is the only galaxy with log(SSFR/yr$^{-1})>-11$ that has no detectable CGM. Given
the properties of G1547, and its absent CGM, it is plausible that G1547 is undergoing quenching due
to a lack of accreting fuel for star-formation, with an estimated quenching timescale of $4\pm1$
Gyr. G1547 provides a unique perspective into the external mechanisms that could explain the migration
of galaxies into the green valley.

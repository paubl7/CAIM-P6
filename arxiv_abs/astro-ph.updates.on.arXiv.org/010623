We report the discovery of a quasar, SDSS J125809.31+351943.0 (J1258), which brightened in optical
for 4 mag from 1983 to 2015, which is one of the largest quasar brightening events so far. The history
of optical photometry data of this quasar from the Catalina Real-time Transient Survey and All Sky
Automated Survey for Super Novae (ASAS-SN), mid-infrared photometry data from the WISE satellite,
and the broad emission line (BEL) flux obtained by spectroscopy of Sloan Digital Sky Survey shows
their significant increases between 2003 and 2015. Investigating its CFHT photometric observations
in 1983 and the USNO-B catalog, which contains data in 1975 and 1969, we found that the source was 4
mag fainter before than the peak of the recent ASAS-SN photometry. From the history of these data,
we identified J1258 as a new Changing-State Quasar (CSQ). We also performed follow-up spectroscopic
observations in December 2018 and May 2019, using the 2-meter telescope in Nishi-Harima Astronomical
Observatory. The results show that the continuum flux and the BEL flux decreased to about 50 % of its
peak. This indicates that J1258 is causing two changing-states for the BEL flux and continuum flux.
We argue that J1258's variability, especially its brightening event, can be explained by the propagation
of the heating front and the accretion disk state transitions based on the timescale and Eddington
ratio variations. The estimated mass of the black hole of J1258 is about an order of magnitude larger
than the CSQs found so far. Since both the changing timescale and the size of the accretion disk depend
on the black hole mass, the J1258 brightening event can be interpreted as a scaled version of the variability
in other CSQs. This suggests that samples of distant quasars with larger black hole masses may contain
objects with longer and severer variations.

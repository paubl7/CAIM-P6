We present synthetic spectra and SEDs computed along evolutionary tracks at Z=1/5 Zsun and Z=1/30
Zsun, for masses between 15 and 150 Msun. We predict that the most massive stars all start their evolution
as O2 dwarfs at sub-solar metallicities. The fraction of lifetime spent in the O2V phase increases
at lower metallicity. The distribution of dwarfs and giants we predict in the SMC accurately reproduces
the observations. Supergiants appear at slightly higher effective temperatures than we predict.
More massive stars enter the giant and supergiant phases closer to the ZAMS, but not as close as for
solar metallicity. This is due to the reduced stellar winds at lower metallicity. Our models with
masses higher than ~60 Msun should appear as O and B stars, whereas these objects are not observed,
confirming a trend reported in the recent literature. At Z=1/30 Zsun, dwarfs cover a wider fraction
of the MS and giants and supergiants appear at lower effective temperatures than at Z=1/5 Zsun. The
UV spectra of these low-metallicity stars have only weak P-Cygni profiles. HeII 1640 sometimes
shows a net emission in the most massive models, with an equivalent width reaching ~1.2 A. For both
sets of metallicities, we provide synthetic spectroscopy in the wavelength range 4500-8000 A.
This range will be covered by the instruments HARMONI and MOSAICS on the ELT and will be relevant to
identify hot massive stars in Local Group galaxies with low extinction. We suggest the use of the
ratio of HeI 7065 to HeII 5412 as a diagnostic for spectral type. We show that this ratio does not depend
on metallicity. Finally, we discuss the ionizing fluxes of our models. The relation between the
hydrogen ionizing flux per unit area versus effective temperature depends only weakly on metallicity.
The ratios of HeI and HeII to H ionizing fluxes both depend on metallicity, although in a slightly
different way.

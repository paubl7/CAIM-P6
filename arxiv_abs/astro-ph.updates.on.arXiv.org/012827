Voids may affect galaxy formation via weakening mass infall or increasing disk sizes, which could
potentially play a role in the formation of giant low surface brightness galaxies (LSBGs). If a dark
matter halo forms at the potential hill corresponding to a void of the cosmic web, which we denote
the 'elaphrocentre' in contrast to a barycentre, then the elaphrocentre should weaken the infall
rate to the halo when compared to infall rates towards barycentres. We investigate this hypothesis
numerically. We present a complete software pipeline to simulate galaxy formation, starting from
a power spectrum of initial perturbations and an N-body simulation through to merger-history-tree
based mass infall histories. The pipeline is built from well-established, free-licensed cosmological
software packages, and aims at highly portable long-term reproducibility. We find that the elaphrocentric
accelerations tending to oppose mass infall are modest. We do not find evidence of location in a void
or elaphrocentric position weakening mass infall towards a galaxy. However, we find indirect evidence
of voids influencing galaxy formation: while void galaxies are of lower mass compared to galaxies
in high density environments, their spin parameters are typically higher. For a fixed mass, the
implied disk scale length would be greater. Tangential accelerations in voids are found to be high
and might significantly contribute to the higher spin parameters. We find significantly later
formation epochs for void galaxies; this should give lower matter densities and may imply lower
surface densities of disk galaxies. Thus, void galaxies have higher spin parameters and later formation
epochs; both are factors that may increase the probability of forming LSBGs in voids.

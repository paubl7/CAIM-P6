In recent years the number of CubeSats (U-class spacecrafts) launched into space has increased
exponentially marking the dawn of the nanosatellite technology. In general these satellites have
a much smaller mass budget compared to conventional scientific satellites which limits shielding
of scientific instruments against direct and indirect radiation in space. In this paper we present
a simulation framework to quantify the signal in large field-of-view gamma-ray scintillation
detectors of satellites induced by X-ray/gamma-ray transients, by taking into account the response
of the detector. Furthermore, we quantify the signal induced by X-ray and particle background sources
at a Low-Earth Orbit outside South Atlantic Anomaly and polar regions. Finally, we calculate the
signal-to-noise ratio taking into account different energy threshold levels. Our simulation
can be used to optimize material composition and predict detectability of various astrophysical
sources by CubeSats. We apply the developed simulation to a satellite belonging to a planned CAMELOT
CubeSat constellation. This project mainly aims to detect short and long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)
and as a secondary science objective, to detect soft gamma-ray repeaters (SGRs) and terrestrial
gamma-ray flashes (TGFs). The simulation includes a detailed computer-aided design (CAD) model
of the satellite to take into account the interaction of particles with the material of the satellite
as accurately as possible. Results of our simulations predict that CubeSats can complement the
large space observatories in high-energy astrophysics for observations of GRBs, SGRs and TGFs.
For the detectors planned to be on board of the CAMELOT CubeSats the simulations show that detections
with signal-to-noise ratio of at least 9 for median GRB and SGR fluxes are achievable.

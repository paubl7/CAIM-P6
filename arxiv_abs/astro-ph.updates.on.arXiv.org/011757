M-dwarf stars are prime targets for exoplanet searches because of their close proximity and favorable
properties for both planet detection and characterization. However, the potential habitability
and atmospheric characterization of these exoplanetary systems depends critically on the history
of high-energy stellar radiation from X-rays to NUV, which drive atmospheric mass loss and photochemistry
in the planetary atmospheres. With the Far Ultraviolet M-dwarf Evolution Survey (FUMES) we have
assessed the evolution of the FUV radiation, specifically 8 prominent emission lines, including
Ly$\alpha$, of M-dwarf stars with stellar rotation period and age. We demonstrate tight power-law
correlations between the spectroscopic FUV features, and measure the intrinsic scatter of the
quiescent FUV emissions. The luminosity evolution with rotation of these spectroscopic features
is well described by a broken power-law, saturated for fast rotators, and decaying with increasing
Rossby number, with a typical power-law slope of $-2$, although likely shallower for Ly$\alpha$.
Our regression fits enable FUV emission line luminosity estimates relative to bolometric from
known rotation periods to within $\sim$0.3 dex, across 8 distinct UV emission lines, with possible
trends in the fit parameters as a function of source layer in the stellar atmosphere. Our detailed
analysis of the UV luminosity evolution with age further shows that habitable zone planets orbiting
lower-mass stars experience much greater high-energy radiative exposure relative the same planets
orbiting more massive hosts. Around early-to-mid M-dwarfs these exoplanets, at field ages, accumulate
up to 10-20$\times$ more EUV energy relative to modern Earth. Moreover, the bulk of this UV exposure
likely takes place within the first Gyr of the stellar lifetime.

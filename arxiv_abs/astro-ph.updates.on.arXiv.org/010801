The NASA mission OSIRIS-REx has been observing near-Earth asteroid (101955) Bennu in close proximity
since December 2018. In this work, we investigate spectral phase reddening -- that is, the variation
of spectral slope with phase angle -- on Bennu using spectra acquired by the OSIRIS-REx Visible and
InfraRed Spectrometer (OVIRS) covering a phase angle range of 8-130$^{o}$. We investigate this
process at the global scale and for some localized regions of interest (ROIs), including boulders,
craters, and the designated sample collection sites of the OSIRIS-REx mission. Bennu has a globally
negative spectra slope, which is typical of B-type asteroids. The spectral slope gently increases
in a linear way up to a phase angle of 90$^{\circ}$, where it approaches zero. The spectral phase reddening
is monotonic and wavelength-dependent with highest values in the visible range. Its coefficient
is 0.00044 $\mu$m$^{-1} ~deg^{-1}$ in the 0.55-2.5 $\mu$m range. For observations of Bennu acquired
at high phase angle (130$^{\circ}$), phase reddening increases exponentially. Similar behavior
was reported in the literature for the carbonaceous chondrite Mukundpura in spectra acquired at
extreme geometries. Some ROIs, including the sample collection site, Nightingale, have a steeper
phase reddening coefficient than the global average, potentially indicating a surface covered
by fine material with high micro-roughness. The gentle spectral phase reddening effect on Bennu
is similar to that observed in ground-based measurements of other B-type asteroids, but much lower
than that observed for other low-albedo bodies such as Ceres or comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.
Monotonic reddening may be associated with the presence of fine particles at micron scales and/or
of particles with fractal structure that introduce micro- and sub-micro roughness across the surface
of Bennu.

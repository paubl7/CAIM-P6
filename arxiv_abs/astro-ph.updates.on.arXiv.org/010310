Multimessenger observations of the neutron star merger event GW170817 have re-energized the debate
over the astrophysical origins of the most massive elements via the r-process nucleosynthesis.
A key aspect of such studies is comparing astronomical observations to theoretical nucleosynthesis
yields in a meaningful way. To perform realistic nucleosynthesis calculations, understanding
the uncertainty in microphysics details such as nuclear reaction rates is as essential as understanding
uncertainties in modeling the astrophysical environment. We present an investigation of neutron
capture rate calculations' uncertainty away from stability using the Hauser-Feshbach model.
We provide a quantitative measure of the calculations' dependability when we extrapolate models
of statistical properties to nuclei in an r-process network. We select several level density and
gamma-ray strength models appropriate for neutron-capture and use them to calculate the reaction
rate for each nucleus in the network. We observe how statistical properties affect the theoretical
reaction rates. The rates are then sampled with the Monte Carlo technique and used in network calculations
to map the range of possible r-process abundances. The results show that neutron capture rates can
vary by a couple of orders of magnitude between calculations. Phenomenological models provide
smoother results than semi-microscopic. They cannot, however, reproduce nuclear structure changes
such as shell closures. While semi-microscopic models predict nuclear structure effects away
from stability, it is not clear that these results are quantitatively accurate. The effect of the
uncertainty on r-process yields is large enough to impede comparisons between observation and
calculations. Progress in developing better microscopic models of gamma strengths and level densities
is urgently needed to improve the fidelity of r-process models.

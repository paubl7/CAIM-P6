Small-scale density fluctuations can significantly affect reionization, but are typically modelled
quite crudely. Unresolved fluctuations in numerical simulations and analytical calculations
are included using a gas \textit{clumping factor}, typically assumed to be independent of the local
environment. In \cite{Mao2019} (Paper I) we presented an improved, local density-dependent model
for the sub-grid gas clumping. Here we extend this using an \textit{empirical stochastic model}
based on the results from high-resolution numerical simulations which fully resolve all relevant
fluctuations. Our model reproduces well both the mean density-clumping relation and its scatter.
We applied our stochastic model, along with the mean clumping one and the Paper I deterministic model,
to create a large-volume realisations of the clumping field, and used these in radiative transfer
simulations of cosmic reionization. Our results show that the simplistic mean clumping model delays
reionization compared to local density-dependent models, despite producing fewer recombinations
overall. This is due to the very different spatial distribution of clumping, resulting in much higher
photoionization rates in the latter cases. The mean clumping model produces smaller H~II regions
throughout most of reionization, but those percolate faster at late times. It also causes significant
delay in the 21-cm fluctuations peak and yields lower non-Gaussianity and many fewer bright pixels
in the PDF distribution. The stochastic density-dependent model shows relatively minor differences
from the deterministic one, mostly concentrated around overlap, where it significantly suppresses
the 21-cm fluctuations, and at the bright tail of the 21-cm PDFs, where it produces noticeably more
bright pixels.

We have performed an unbiased dense core survey toward the Orion A Giant Molecular Cloud in the C$^{18}$O
($J$=1--0) emission line taken with the Nobeyama Radio Observatory (NRO) 45-m telescope. The effective
angular resolution of the map is 26", which corresponds to $\sim$ 0.05 pc at a distance of 414 pc. By
using the Herschel-Planck H$_2$ column density map, we calculate the C$^{18}$O fractional abundance
and find that it is roughly constant over the column density range of $\lesssim$ 5 $\times$ 10$^{22}$
cm$^{-3}$, although a trend of C$^{18}$O depletion is determined toward higher column density.
Therefore, C$^{18}$O intensity can follow the cloud structure reasonably well. The mean C$^{18}$O
abundance in Orion A is estimated to be 5.7$\times$10$^{-7}$, which is about 3 times larger than
the fiducial value. We identified 746 C$^{18}$O cores with astrodendro and classified 709 cores
as starless cores. We compute the core masses by decomposing the Herschel-Planck dust column density
using the relative proportions of the C$^{18}$O integrated intensities of line-of-sight components.
Applying this procedure, we attempt to remove the contribution of the background emission, i.e.,
the ambient gas outside the cores. Then, we derived mass function for starless cores and found that
it resembles the stellar initial mass function (IMF). The CMF for starless cores, $dN/dM$, is fitted
with a power-law relation of $M^\alpha$ with a power index of $\alpha = -$2.25$\pm$ 0.16 at the high-mass
slope ($\gtrsim$ 0.44 $M_\odot$). We also found that the ratio of each core mass to the total mass
integrated along the line of sight is significantly large. Therefore, in the previous studies,
the core masses derived from the dust image are likely to be overestimated at least by a factor of a
few. Accordingly, such previous studies may underestimate the star formation efficiency of individual
cores.

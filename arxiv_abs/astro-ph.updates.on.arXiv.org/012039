We investigate the photoionised X-ray emission line regions (ELRs) within the Seyfert 2 galaxy
NGC 1068, to determine if there are any characteristic changes between observations taken fourteen
years apart. We compare XMM-Newton observations collected in 2000 and 2014, simultaneously fitting
the reflection grating spectrometer (RGS) and EPIC-pn spectra of each epoch, for the first time,
with the photoionisation model, PION, in SPEX. We find that four PION components are required to
fit the majority of the emission lines in the spectra of NGC 1068, with $\log \xi=1-4$, $\log N_H>26
m^{-2}$, and $v_{out}=-100$ to $-600 kms^{-1}$ for both epochs. Comparing the ionisation state
of the components shows almost no difference between the two epochs, while there is an increase in
the total column density. To estimate the locations of these plasma regions from the central black
hole we compare distance methods, excluding the variability arguments as there is no spectral change
between observations. Although the methods are unable to constrain the distances, the locations
are consistent with the narrow line region, with the possibility of the higher ionised component
being part of the broad line region, but we cannot conclude this for certain. In addition, we find
evidence for emission from collisionally ionised plasma, while previous analysis had suggested
that collisional plasma emission was unlikely. However, although PION is unable to account for
the FeXVII emission lines at 15 and 17 \AA, we do not rule out that photoexcitation is a valid processes
to produce these lines too. NGC 1068 has not changed, both in terms of the observed spectra or from
our modelling, within the 14 year time period between observations. This suggests that the ELRs
are fairly static relative to the 14 year time frame between observations, or there is no dramatic
change in the black hole variability.

Stellar atmospheric parameters (effective temperature, luminosity classifications, and metallicity)
estimates for some 24 million stars (including over 19 million dwarfs and 5 million giants) are determined
from the stellar colors of SMSS DR2 and Gaia EDR3, based on training datasets with available spectroscopic
measurements from previous high/medium/low-resolution spectroscopic surveys. The number of
stars with photometric-metallicity estimates is 4--5 times larger than that collected by the current
largest spectroscopic survey to date -- LAMOST -- over the course of the past decade. External checks
indicate that the precision of the photometric-metallicity estimates are quite high, comparable
to or slightly better than that derived from spectroscopy, with typical values around 0.05--0.10
dex for [Fe/H] $> -1.0$, 0.10--0.20 dex for $-2.0 <$ [Fe/H]$ \le -1.0$ and 0.20--0.25dex for [Fe/H]
$\le -2.0$, and include estimates for stars as metal-poor as [Fe/H] $\sim -3.5$, substantially
lower than previous photometric techniques. Photometric-metallicity estimates are obtained
for an unprecedented number of metal-poor stars, including a total of over three million metal-poor
(MP; [Fe/H] $\le -1.0$) stars, over half a million very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] $\le -2.0)$ stars,
and over 25,000 extremely metal-poor (EMP; [Fe/H] $\le -3.0$) stars. From either parallax measurements
from Gaia EDR3 or metallicity-dependent color-absolute magnitude fiducials, distances are determined
for over 20 million stars in our sample. For the over 18 million sample stars with accurate absolute
magnitude estimates from Gaia parallaxes, stellar ages are estimated by comparing with theoretical
isochrones. Astrometric information is provided for the stars in our catalog, along with radial
velocities for ~10% of our sample stars, taken from completed or ongoing large-scale spectroscopic
surveys.

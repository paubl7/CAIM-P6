We discuss the largest and most homogeneous spectroscopic dataset of field RR Lyrae variables (RRLs)
available to date. We estimated abundances using both high-resolution and low-resolution ({\Delta
S} method) spectra for fundamental (RRab) and first overtone (RRc) RRLs. The iron abundances for
7,941 RRLs were supplemented with similar literature estimates available, ending up with 9,015
RRLs (6,150 RRab, 2,865 RRc). The metallicity distribution shows a mean value of <[Fe/H]> = -1.51\pm0.01,
and {\sigma}(standard deviation)= 0.41 dex with a long metal-poor tail approaching [Fe/H] = -3
and a sharp metal-rich tail approaching solar iron abundance. The RRab variables are more metal-rich
(<[Fe/H]>ab = -1.48\pm0.01, {\sigma} = 0.41 dex) than RRc variables (<[Fe/H]>c = -1.58\pm0.01,
{\sigma} = 0.40 dex). The relative fraction of RRab variables in the Bailey diagram (visual amplitude
vs period) located along the short-period (more metal-rich) and the long-period (more metal-poor)
sequences are 80% and 20\%, while RRc variables display an opposite trend, namely 30\% and 70\%.
We found that the pulsation period of both RRab and RRc variables steadily decreases when moving
from the metal-poor to the metal-rich regime. The visual amplitude shows the same trend, but RRc
amplitudes are almost two times more sensitive than RRab amplitudes to metallicity. We also investigated
the dependence of the population ratio (Nc/Ntot) of field RRLs on the metallicity and we found that
the distribution is more complex than in globular clusters. The population ratio steadily increases
from ~0.25 to ~0.36 in the metal-poor regime, it decreases from ~0.36 to ~0.18 for -1.8 < [Fe/H] < -0.9
and it increases to a value of ~0.3 approaching solar iron abundance.

Planet formation models begin with proto-embryos and planetesimals already fully formed, missing
out a crucial step, the formation of planetesimals/proto-embryos. In this work, we include prescriptions
for planetesimal and proto-embryo formation arising from pebbles becoming trapped in short-lived
pressure bumps, in thermally evolving viscous discs to examine the sizes and distributions of proto-embryos
and planetesimals throughout the disc. We find that planetesimal sizes increase with orbital distance,
from ~10 km close to the star to hundreds of kilometres further away. Proto-embryo masses are also
found to increase with orbital radius, ranging from $10^{-6} M_{\rm \oplus}$ around the iceline,
to $10^{-3} M_{\rm \oplus}$ near the orbit of Pluto. We include prescriptions for pebble and planetesimal
accretion to examine the masses that proto-embryos can attain. Close to the star, planetesimal
accretion is efficient due to small planetesimals, whilst pebble accretion is efficient where
pebble sizes are fragmentation limited, but inefficient when drift dominated due to low accretion
rates before the pebble supply diminishes. Exterior to the iceline, planetesimal accretion becomes
inefficient due to increasing planetesimal eccentricities, whilst pebble accretion becomes
more efficient as the initial proto-embryo masses increase, allowing them to significantly grow
before the pebble supply is depleted. Combining both scenarios allows for more massive proto-embryos
at larger distances, since the accretion of planetesimals allows pebble accretion to become more
efficient, allowing giant planet cores to form at distances upto 10 au. By including more realistic
initial proto-embryo and planetesimal sizes, as well as combined accretion scenarios, should
allow for a more complete understanding in the beginning to end process of how planets and planetary
systems form.

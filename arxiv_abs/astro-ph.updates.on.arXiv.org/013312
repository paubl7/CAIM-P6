Reheating connects the inflationary universe to the radiation-dominated evolution of standard
Big Bang cosmology. Due to the lack of direct observations, we rely on indirect bounds on this phase
from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) data. Using reheating constraints to arrive at additional
constraints on inflationary models is prevalent in the literature. In this work, we develop a formalism
to analyze the reheating constraints for the general case of single field canonical slow-roll inflation
without dealing with a specific inflationary model. We find that using the lower bound on reheating
temperature and the upper bound on the tensor-to-scalar ratio: one can constrain the inflationary
energy scale and the duration of the reheating epoch after slow-roll inflation. Following the standard
practice, we described the reheating phase with an effective equation of state parameter~($w_{\rm
re}$). However, with the present formalism, we can have quantitative information of the reheating
phase even when the reheating equation of state behaves as radiation $w_{\rm re} = 1/3$. For the canonical
reheating phase described by $w_{\rm re}<1/3$, we find that the inflationary efolding number must
be bounded from above, i.e., $N_k\leq56.09$. Consequently, if inflationary efolds satisfy this
upper bound---i.e., $N_k=56.09$---a finite period of reheating is only possible for exotic reheating
phases described by $w_{\rm re}>1/3$. We also find that as we lower the value of $N_k$, the corresponding
energy scale of inflation also decreases. Consequently, it will be more and more difficult to detect
the corresponding inflationary gravitational wave signals with the Gravitational Waves mission.
Finally, we show how an extended period of canonical reheating can improve the situation in those
cases.

Using a set of high-resolution simulations we study the statistical correlation of dark matter
halo properties with the large-scale environment. We consider halo populations split into four
Cosmic Web (CW) elements: voids, walls, filaments, and nodes. For the first time we present a study
of CW effects for halos covering six decades in mass: $10^{8}-10^{14}{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$.
We find that the fraction of halos living in various web components is a strong function of mass, with
the majority of $M>10^{12}{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$ halos living in filaments and nodes. Low mass
halos are more equitably distributed in filaments, walls, and voids. For halo density profiles
and formation times we find a universal mass threshold of $M_{th}\sim6\times10^{10}{h^{-1}{\rm
M}_{\odot}}$ below which these properties vary with environment. Here, filament halos have the
steepest concentration-mass relation, walls are close to the overall mean, and void halos have
the flattest relation. This amounts to $c_{200}$ for filament and void halos that are respectively
$14\%$ higher and $7\%$ lower than the mean at $M=2\times10^8{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$, with low-mass
node halos are most likely splashed-back. We find double power-law fits that very well describe
$c(M)$ for the four environments in the whole probed mass range. A complementary picture is found
for the average formation times, with the mass-formation time relations following trends shown
for the concentrations: the nodes halos being the oldest and void halo the youngest. The CW environmental
effect is much weaker when studying the halo spin and shapes. The trends with halo mass is reversed:
the small halos with $M<10^{10}{h^{-1}{\rm M}_{\odot}}$ seem to be unaffected by the CW environment.
Some weak trends are visible for more massive void and walls halos, which, on average, are characterized
by lower spin and higher triaxiality parameters.

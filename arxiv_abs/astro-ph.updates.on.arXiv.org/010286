Modelling the mass distributions of strong gravitational lenses is often necessary to use them
as astrophysical and cosmological probes. With the high number of lens systems ($>10^5$) expected
from upcoming surveys, it is timely to explore efficient modeling approaches beyond traditional
MCMC techniques that are time consuming. We train a CNN on images of galaxy-scale lenses to predict
the parameters of the SIE mass model ($x,y,e_x,e_y$, and $\theta_E$). To train the network, we simulate
images based on real observations from the HSC Survey for the lens galaxies and from the HUDF as lensed
galaxies. We tested different network architectures, the effect of different data sets, and using
different input distributions of $\theta_E$. We find that the CNN performs well and obtain with
the network trained with a uniform distribution of $\theta_E$ $>0.5"$ the following median values
with $1\sigma$ scatter: $\Delta x=(0.00^{+0.30}_{-0.30})"$, $\Delta y=(0.00^{+0.30}_{-0.29})"
$, $\Delta \theta_E=(0.07^{+0.29}_{-0.12})"$, $\Delta e_x = -0.01^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$ and $\Delta
e_y = 0.00^{+0.08}_{-0.09}$. The bias in $\theta_E$ is driven by systems with small $\theta_E$.
Therefore, when we further predict the multiple lensed image positions and time delays based on
the network output, we apply the network to the sample limited to $\theta_E>0.8"$. In this case,
the offset between the predicted and input lensed image positions is $(0.00_{-0.29}^{+0.29})"$
and $(0.00_{-0.31}^{+0.32})"$ for $x$ and $y$, respectively. For the fractional difference between
the predicted and true time delay, we obtain $0.04_{-0.05}^{+0.27}$. Our CNN is able to predict
the SIE parameters in fractions of a second on a single CPU and with the output we can predict the image
positions and time delays in an automated way, such that we are able to process efficiently the huge
amount of expected lens detections in the near future.

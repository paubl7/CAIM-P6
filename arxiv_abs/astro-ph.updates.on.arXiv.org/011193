Context. The characterisation of exoplanet atmospheres has shown a wide diversity in compositions.
Hot Jupiters have the appropriate temperatures to host metallic compounds, which should be detectable
through transmission spectroscopy. Aims. We aim to detect exotic species in transmission spectra
of hot Jupiters, specifically WASP-31b, by testing a variety of chemical species to explain the
spectrum. Methods. We conduct a re-analysis of publicly available transmission data of WASP-31b
using the Bayesian retrieval framework TauREx II. We retrieve various combinations of the opacities
of 25 species to determine the minimum set needed to fit the observed spectrum. Results. We report
evidence for the spectroscopic signatures of chromium hydride (CrH), H2O and K in WASP-31b. Compared
to a flat model without any signatures, a CrH-only model is preferred with a statistical significance
of ~3.9 sigma. A model consisting of both CrH+H2O is found with ~2.6 sigma and ~3 sigma confidence
over a CrH-only and H2O-only model respectively. Weak evidence for the addition of K is found at ~2.2
sigma over the H2O+CrH model, although the fidelity of the data point associated with this signature
was questioned in earlier studies. Finally, the inclusion of collision-induced absorption and
a Rayleigh scattering slope is found with ~3.5 sigma confidence over a flat model. This analysis
presents the first evidence for signatures of CrH in a hot Jupiter atmosphere. At a retrieved temperature
of ~1481 K, the atmosphere of WASP-31b is hot enough to host gaseous Cr-bearing species. The retrieved
abundances agree well with predictions from thermal equilibrium chemistry and with the abundance
found in an L-type brown dwarf atmosphere. However, additional retrievals using VLT FORS2 data
lead to a non-detection of CrH. Future coverage with JWST has the potential to confirm the detection
and discover other CrH features.

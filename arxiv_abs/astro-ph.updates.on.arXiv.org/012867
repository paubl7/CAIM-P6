Electromagnetic waves due to electron-positron clouds (bunches), created by cascading processes
in pulsar magnetospheres, have been proposed to explain the pulsar radio emission. In order to verify
this hypothesis, we utilized for the first time Particle-in-Cell (PIC-) code simulations to study
the nonlinear evolution of electron-positron bunches in dependence on the relative drift speeds
of electrons and positrons, on the initial plasma temperature, and on the initial distance between
the bunches. For this sake, we utilized the PIC-code ACRONYM with a high-order field solver and particle
weighting factor, appropriate to describe relativistic pair plasmas. We found that the bunch expansion
is mainly determined by the relative electron-positron drift speed. Finite drift speeds were found
to cause the generation of strong electric fields that reach up to $E \sim 7.5 \times 10^{5}$ V/cm
($E / (m_\mathrm{e} c \omega_\mathrm{p} e^{-1}) \sim 4.4$) and strong plasma heating. As a result,
up to 15~\% of the initial kinetic energy is transformed into the electric field energy. Assuming
the same electron- and positron-distributions we found that the fastest (in the bunch reference
frame) particles of consecutively emitted bunches eventually overlap in the momentum (velocity)
space. This overlap causes two-stream instabilities that generate (electrostatic) subluminal
L-mode waves with electric field amplitudes reaching up to $E \sim 1.9\times 10^{4}$ V/cm ($E / (m_\mathrm{e}
c \omega_\mathrm{p} e^{-1}) \sim 0.11$). We found that the interaction of electron-position bunches
leads to plasma heating, to the generation of strong electric fields and of intense superluminal
L-mode waves which, in principle, can be behind the observed electromagnetic emissions of pulsars
in the radio wave range.

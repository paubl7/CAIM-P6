Classical T Tauri stars (CTTs) magnetically interact with their surrounding disks, a process that
is thought to regulate their rotational evolution. In this work, we compute torques acting onto
the stellar surface of CTTs arising from different accreting (accretion funnels) and ejecting
(stellar winds and magnetospheric ejections) flow components. Furthermore, we compare the magnetic
braking due to stellar winds in two different systems: isolated and accreting stars. 2.5D magnetohydrodynamic,
time-dependent, axisymmetric simulations are employed. For both systems the stellar wind is thermally
driven. In the star-disk-interaction (SDI) simulations the accretion disk is Keplerian, viscous,
and resistive. Two series of simulations are presented, one for each system. We find that in classical
T Tauri systems the presence of magnetospheric ejections confines the stellar-wind expansion,
resulting in an hourglass-shaped geometry of the outflow. In addition, the formation of the accretion
columns modifies the amount of open magnetic flux exploited by the stellar wind. These effects have
a strong impact on the stellar wind properties and we show that the stellar-wind braking is more efficient
in the star-disk-interacting systems than in the isolated ones. We also derive torque scalings,
over a wide range of magnetic field strengths, for each flow component in a SDI system that directly
applies a torque on the stellar surface. In all the performed SDI simulations the stellar wind extracts
less than 2% of the mass accretion rate and the disk is truncated up to 66% of the corotation radius.
All the simulations show a net spin-up torque. In order to achieve a stellar-spin equilibrium we
need either more massive stellar winds or disks being truncated closer to the corotation radius,
which increases the torque efficiency by the magnetospheric ejections.

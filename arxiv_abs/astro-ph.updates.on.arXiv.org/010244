The valence of iron has been used in terrestrial studies to trace the hydrolysis of primary silicate
rocks. Here, we use a similar approach to characterize the secondary processes, namely thermal
metamorphism and aqueous alteration, that have affected carbonaceous chondrites. X-ray absorption
near-edge structure spectroscopy at the Fe-K- edge was performed on a series of 36 CM, 9 CR, 10 CV,
and 2 CI chondrites. Among the four carbonaceous chondrites groups studied, a correlation between
the iron oxidation index (IOI = [2 ((Fe2+) + 3(Fe3+))/FeTOT) and the hydrogen content is observed.
However, within the CM group, for which a progressive alteration sequence has been defined, a conversion
of Fe3+ to Fe2+ is observed with increasing degree of aqueous alteration. This reduction of iron
can be explained by an evolution in the mineralogy of the secondary phases. In the case of the few CM
chondrites that experienced some thermal metamorphism, in addition to aqueous alteration, a redox
memory of the aqueous alteration is present: a significant fraction of 3+ 2+ 0 Fe is present, together
with Fe and sometimes Fe. From our data set, the CR chondrites show a wider range of IOI from 1.5 to 2.5.
In all considered CR chondrites, the three oxidation states of iron coexist. Even in the least-altered
CR chondrites, the fraction of Fe3+ can be high (30% for MET 00426). This observation confirms that
oxidized iron has been integrated during formation of fine-grained amorphous material in the matrix.
Last, the IOI of CV chondrites does not reflect the reduced/oxidized classification based on metal
and magnetite proportions, but is strongly correlated with petrographic types. The valence of
iron in CV chondrites therefore appears to be most closely related to thermal history, rather than
aqueous alteration, even if these processes can occur together .

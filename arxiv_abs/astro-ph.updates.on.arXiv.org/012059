Gravitational waves (GWs) from merging black holes and neutron stars directly measure the luminosity
distance to the merger, which, when combined with an independent measurement of the source's redshift,
provides a novel probe of cosmology. The proposed next generation of ground-based GW detectors,
Einstein Telescope and Cosmic Explorer, will detect tens of thousands of binary neutron stars (BNSs)
out to cosmological distances ($z>2$), beyond the peak of the star formation rate (SFR), or "cosmic
noon." At these distances, it will be challenging to measure the sources' redshifts by observing
electromagnetic (EM) counterparts or statistically marginalizing over a galaxy catalog. We argue
that even in the absence of an EM counterpart or galaxy catalog, the BNS redshift distribution will
be measured by independent observations of short gamma ray bursts (GRBs), kilonovae, and known
BNS host galaxies. As a simple example, we consider the case in which the BNS rate is \textit{a priori}
known to follow the SFR and explore how combining this redshift distribution with measurements
of GW distances can constrain cosmology and modified gravity theories. We find that $\mathcal{O}(10,000)$
events (to be expected within a year of observation with Cosmic Explorer) would yield a sub-tenth
percent measurement of the combination $H_0^{2.8}\Omega_M$ in a flat $\Lambda$CDM model. Beyond
$\Lambda$CDM, this method would enable a 5\% measurement of the dark energy equation of state parameter
$w$ given a sub-percent prior measurement on $H_0$ and $\Omega_M$. Alternatively, fixing the background
cosmology and instead probing modified GW propagation, we expect to constrain the running of the
Planck mass parameter $c_M$ to $\pm0.02$.

We surveyed the Aquila Rift complex including the Serpens South and W40 region in the NH$_3$(1,1)
and (2,2) transitions making use of the Nanshan 26-m telescope. The kinetic temperatures of the
dense gas in the Aquila Rift complex range from 8.9 to 35.0K with an average of 15.3$\pm$6.1K. Low
gas temperatures associate with Serpens South ranging from 8.9 to 16.8K with an average 12.3$\pm$1.7K,
while dense gas in the W40 region shows higher temperatures ranging from 17.7 to 35.0K with an average
of 25.1$\pm$4.9 K. A comparison of kinetic temperatures against HiGal dust temperatures indicates
that the gas and dust temperatures are in agreement in the low mass star formation region of Serpens
South. In the high mass star formation region W40, the measured gas kinetic temperatures are higher
than those of the dust. The turbulent component of the velocity dispersion of NH$_3$(1,1) is found
to be positively correlated with the gas kinetic temperature, which indicates that the dense gas
may be heated by dissipation of turbulent energy. For the fractional total-NH3 abundance obtained
by a comparison with Herschel infrared continuum data representing dust emission we find values
from 0.1 to 21$\times 10^{-8}$ with an average of 6.9$(\pm 4.5)\times 10^{-8}$. Serpens South also
shows a fractional total-NH3 abundance ranging from 0.2 to 21$\times 10^{-8}$ with an average of
8.6($\pm 3.8)\times 10^{-8}$. In W40, values are lower, between 0.1 and 4.3$\times 10^{-8}$ with
an average of 1.6($\pm 1.4)\times 10^{-8}$. Weak velocity gradients demonstrate that the rotational
energy is a negligible fraction of the gravitational energy. In W40, gas and dust temperatures are
not strongly dependent on the projected distance to the recently formed massive stars. Overall,
the morphology of the mapped region is ring-like, with strong emission at lower and weak emission
at higher Galactic longitudes.

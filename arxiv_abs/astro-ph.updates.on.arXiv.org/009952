High levels of X-ray and UV activity on young M dwarfs may drive rapid atmospheric escape on temperate,
terrestrial planets orbiting within the liquid water habitable zone. However, secondary atmospheres
on planets orbiting older, less active M dwarfs may be stable and present more promising candidates
for biomarker searches. We present new HST and Chandra observations of Barnard's Star (GJ 699),
a 10 Gyr old M3.5 dwarf, acquired as part of the Mega-MUSCLES program. Despite the old age and long
rotation period of Barnard's star, we observe two FUV ($\delta_{130}$ $\approx$ 5000s; $E_{130}$
$\approx$ 10$^{29.5}$ erg each) and one X-ray ($E_{X}$ $\approx$ 10$^{29.2}$ erg) flares, and
estimate a high-energy flare duty cycle (defined here as the fraction of the time the star is in a flare
state) of $\sim$ 25\%. A 5 A - 10 $\mu$m SED of GJ 699 is created and used to evaluate the atmospheric
stability of a hypothetical, unmagnetized terrestrial planet in the habitable zone ($r_{HZ}$
$\sim$ 0.1 AU). Both thermal and non-thermal escape modeling indicate (1) the $quiescent$ stellar
XUV flux does not lead to strong atmospheric escape: atmospheric heating rates are comparable to
periods of high solar activity on modern Earth, and (2) the $flare$ environment could drive the atmosphere
into a hydrodynamic loss regime at the observed flare duty cycle: sustained exposure to the flare
environment of GJ 699 results in the loss of $\approx$ 87 Earth atmospheres Gyr$^{-1}$ through thermal
processes and $\approx$ 3 Earth atmospheres Gyr$^{-1}$ through ion loss processes, respectively.
These results suggest that if rocky planet atmospheres can survive the initial $\sim$ 5 Gyr of high
stellar activity, or if a second generation atmosphere can be formed or acquired, the flare duty
cycle may be the controlling stellar parameter for the stability of Earth-like atmospheres around
old M stars.

The majority of massive stars live in binary or multiple systems and will interact during their lifetimes,
which helps to explain the observed diversity of core-collapse supernovae. Donor stars in binary
systems can lose most of their hydrogen-rich envelopes through mass transfer, which not only affects
the surface properties, but also the core structure. However, most calculations of the core-collapse
properties of massive stars rely on single-star models. We present a systematic study of the difference
between the pre-supernova structures of single stars and stars of the same initial mass (11 - 21\Msun)
that have been stripped due to stable post-main sequence mass transfer at solar metallicity. We
present the pre-supernova core composition with novel diagrams that give an intuitive representation
of the isotope distribution. As shown in previous studies, at the edge of the carbon-oxygen core,
the binary-stripped star models contain an extended gradient of carbon, oxygen, and neon. This
layer originates from the receding of the convective helium core during core helium burning in binary-stripped
stars, which does not occur in single-star models. We find that this same evolutionary phase leads
to systematic differences in the final density and nuclear energy generation profiles. Binary-stripped
star models have systematically higher total masses of carbon at the moment of core collapse compared
to single star models, which likely results in systematically different supernova yields. In about
half of our models, the silicon-burning and oxygen-rich layers merge after core silicon burning.
We discuss the implications of our findings for the explodability, supernova observations, and
nucleosynthesis from these stars. Our models will be publicly available and can be readily used
as input for supernova simulations. [Abridged]

[Abridged] Filaments and hubs have received special attention recently thanks to studies showing
their role in star formation. While the column density and velocity structures of both filaments
and hubs have been studied, their magnetic fields (B-field) are not yet characterized. We aim to
understand the role of the B-field in the dynamical evolution of the NGC 6334 hub-filament network.
We present new observations of the dust polarized emission at 850$\mu$m towards NGC 6334 obtained
with the JCMT/POL-2. We study the distribution and dispersion of the polarized intensity ($PI$),
the polarization fraction ($PF$), and the B-field angle ($\theta_{B}$). We derive the power spectrum
of the intensity and $\theta_{B}$ along the ridge crest. Our analyses show a complex B-field structure
when observed over the whole region ($\sim10$ pc), however, at smaller scales ($\sim1$ pc), $\theta_{B}$
varies coherently along the filaments. The observed power spectrum of $\theta_{B}$ can be well
represented with a power law function with a slope $-1.33\pm0.23$, which is $\sim20\%$ shallower
than that of $I$. This result is compatible with the properties of simulated filaments and may indicate
the processes at play in the formation of filaments. $\theta_{B}$ rotates from being mostly perpendicular
to the filament crests to mostly parallel as they merge with the hubs. This variation of $\theta_{B}$
may be tracing local velocity flows of matter in-falling onto the hubs. Our analysis suggests a variation
of the energy balance along the crests of these filaments, from magnetically critical/supercritical
at their far ends to magnetically subcritical near the hubs. We detect an increase of $PF$ towards
the high-column density star cluster-forming hubs that may result from the increase of grain alignment
efficiency due to stellar radiation from the newborn stars.

We present a catalog of 4195 optically confirmed Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) selected galaxy clusters
detected in 13,168 deg$^2$ of sky surveyed by the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (ACT). Cluster candidates
were selected by applying a multi-frequency matched filter to 98 and 150 GHz maps constructed from
all ACT observations obtained from 2008-2018, and subsequently confirmed using deep, wide-area
optical surveys. The detected clusters span the redshift range 0.04 < z < 1.91, with median z = 0.52.
The catalog contains 221 z > 1 clusters, and a total of 872 systems are new discoveries. Assuming an
SZ-signal vs. mass scaling relation calibrated from X-ray observations, the sample has a 90% completeness
mass limit of M500c > 3.8 x 10$^{14}$ MSun, evaluated at the median redshift of the cluster sample,
for clusters detected at signal-to-noise ratio > 5 in maps filtered at an angular scale of 2.4'. The
cluster sample is more than 22 times larger than the previous ACT cluster catalog, and is the largest
homogeneous sample of SZ-selected clusters to date. The survey footprint has a large overlap with
deep optical weak-lensing surveys that are being used to calibrate the SZ-signal mass-scaling
relation, such as the Dark Energy Survey (4552 deg$^2$), the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru Strategic
Program (468 deg$^2$), and the Kilo Degree Survey (823 deg$^2$). We briefly discuss some noteworthy
objects in the sample, including potentially projected systems; clusters with potential strong
lensing features; clusters with active central galaxies or star formation; and systems of two or
more clusters that may be physically associated. The cluster catalog will be a useful resource for
future cosmological analyses, and studying the evolution of the intracluster medium and the galaxy
population in massive clusters over the past 10 Gyr.

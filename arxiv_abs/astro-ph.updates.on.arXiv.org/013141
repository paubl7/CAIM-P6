We present the first results from SPHINX-MHD, a suite of cosmological radiation-magnetohydrodynamics
simulations designed to study the impact of primordial magnetic fields (PMFs) on galaxy formation
and the evolution of the intergalactic medium during the epoch of reionization. The simulations
are among the first to employ multi-frequency, on-the-fly radiation transfer and constrained
transport ideal MHD in a cosmological context to simultaneously model the inhomogeneous process
of reionization as well as the growth of PMFs. We run a series of $(5\,\text{cMpc})^3$ cosmological
volumes, varying both the strength of the seed magnetic field ($B_0$) and its spectral index ($n_B$).
We find that PMFs that have $n_B > -0.562\log_{10}\left(\frac{B_0}{1{\rm n}G}\right) - 3.35$
produce electron optical depths ($\tau_e$) that are inconsistent with CMB constraints due to the
unrealistically early collapse of low-mass dwarf galaxies. For $n_B\geq-2.9$, our constraints
are considerably tighter than the $\sim{\rm n}G$ constraints from Planck. PMFs that do not satisfy
our constraints have little impact on the reionization history or the shape of the UV luminosity
function. Likewise, detecting changes in the Lya forest due to PMFs will be challenging because
photoionisation and photoheating efficiently smooth the density field. However, we find that
the first absorption feature in the global 21cm signal is a sensitive indicator of the properties
of the PMFs, even for those that satisfy our $\tau_e$ constraint. Furthermore, strong PMFs can marginally
increase the escape of LyC photons by up to 25\% and shrink the effective radii of galaxies by $\sim44\%$
which could increase the completeness fraction of galaxy surveys. Finally, our simulations show
that surveys with a magnitude limit of ${\rm M_{UV,1500}=-13}$ can probe the sources that provide
the majority of photons for reionization out to $z=12$.

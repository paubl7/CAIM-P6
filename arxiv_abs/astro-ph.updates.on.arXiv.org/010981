Ly$\alpha$ emission from galaxies can be utilized to characterize the ionization state in the intergalactic
medium (IGM). We report our search for Ly$\alpha$ emission at $z>7$ using a comprehensive Keck/MOSFIRE
near-infrared spectroscopic dataset, as part of the Texas Spectroscopic Search for Ly$\alpha$
Emission at the End of Reionization Survey. We analyze data from 10 nights of MOSFIRE observations
which together target 72 high-$z$ candidate galaxies in the GOODS-N field, all with deep exposure
times of 4.5-19 hr. Utilizing an improved automated emission-line search, we report 10 Ly$\alpha$
emission lines detected ($>$4$\sigma$) at $z>7$, significantly increasing the spectroscopically
confirmed sample. Our sample includes large equivalent-width (EW) Ly$\alpha$ emitters ($>$50\r{A}),
and additional tentative Ly$\alpha$ emission lines detected at 3 - 4$\sigma$ from five additional
galaxies. We constrain the Ly$\alpha$ EW distribution at $z\sim7.6$, finding a significant drop
from $z\lesssim6$, suggesting an increasing fraction of neutral hydrogen (HI) in the IGM in this
epoch. We estimate the Ly$\alpha$ transmission through the IGM ($=$EW$_{z\sim\text{7.6}}$/EW$_{z\sim\text{2-6}}$),
and infer an IGM HI fraction ($X_{\text{HI}}$) of $49^{+19}_{-19}\%$ at $z\sim7.6$, which is lower
in modest tension ($>$1$\sigma$) with recent measurements at $z \sim$ 7.6. The spatial distribution
of the detected Ly$\alpha$ emitters implies the presence of a potential highly ionized region at
$z\sim7.55$ which hosts four Ly$\alpha$ emitters within a $\sim$ 40 cMpc spatial separation. The
prominence of this ionized region in our dataset could explain our lower inferred value of $X_{\text{HI}}$,
though our analysis is also sensitive to the chosen reference Ly$\alpha$ EW distribution values
and reionization models.

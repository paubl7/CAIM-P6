We use a sample of $z=0$ galaxies visually classified as slow rotators (SRs) in the EAGLE hydrodynamical
simulations to explore the effect of galaxy mergers on their formation, characterise their intrinsic
galaxy properties, and study the connection between quenching and kinematic transformation.
SRs that have had major or minor mergers (mass ratios $\ge 0.3$ and $0.1-0.3$, respectively) tend
to have a higher triaxiality parameter and ex-situ stellar fractions than those that had exclusively
very minor mergers or formed in the absence of mergers ("no-merger" SRs). No-merger SRs are more
compact, have lower black hole-to-stellar mass ratios and quenched later than other SRs, leaving
imprints on their $z=0$ chemical composition. For the vast majority of SRs we find that quenching,
driven by active galactic nuclei feedback, precedes kinematic transformation, except for satellite
SRs, in which these processes happen in tandem. However, in $\approx 50$\% of these satellites,
satellite-satellite mergers are responsible for their SR fate, while environment (i.e. tidal
field and interactions with the central) can account for the transformation in the rest. By splitting
SRs into kinematic sub-classes, we find that flat SRs prefer major mergers; round SRs prefer minor
or very minor mergers; prolate SRs prefer gas-poor mergers. Flat and prolate SRs are more common
among satellites hosted by massive halos ($>10^{13.6}\,\rm M_{\odot}$) and centrals of high masses
($M_{\star} > 10^{10.5}\, \rm M_{\odot}$). Although EAGLE galaxies display kinematic properties
that broadly agree with observations, there are areas of disagreement, such as inverted stellar
age and velocity dispersion profiles. We discuss these and how upcoming simulations can solve them.

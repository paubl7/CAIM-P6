GRS 1915+105 is a transient black hole X-ray binary consistently emitting 10-100% of the Eddington
luminosity in the X-ray band during the last three decades until mid-2018 when the source luminosity
suddenly decreased by an order of magnitude. This phase was followed by a change to a state with even
lower average X-ray fluxes never seen before during the outburst but presenting renewed flaring
activity at different wavelengths. Nevertheless, the mean fluxes were still in decline. GRS 1915+105
has the longest orbital period known among low-mass X-ray binaries, the largest accretion disk
size, and therefore the largest mass supply for accretion. The high inclination of the disk allows
the study of geometrical effects of the accretion flow such as changes in the height-to-radius ratio
or the effect of accretion disk winds on the intrinsic emission that are expected during the outburst
decay. In addition, the transient jet is expected to change to a compact, self-absorbed, steady
jet. We conducted two full polarization Atacama Large Millimeter Array observations to study the
jet properties during the outburst decay by analyzing the spectral, polarization, and intra-epoch
variability for both observation epochs. In addition, we analyzed nearly daily Neutron Star Interior
Composition Explorer pointing observations consisting of modeling X-ray power spectral densities,
spectral energy distributions, and lightcurves with a physically motivated model to follow the
changing accretion disk properties throughout the outburst decay and relating them to the jet emission.
We show that the X-ray and mm spectral, timing, and polarization properties are consistent with
those of a typical decaying X-ray binary outburst and that GRS 1915+105 has descended into the low-luminosity
hard X-ray state.

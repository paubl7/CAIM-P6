The main purpose of this work is to perform an analysis of realistic new trajectories for a robotic
mission to Saturn's largest moon, Titan, in order to demonstrate the great advantages related to
the Direct Fusion Drive (DFD). The DFD is a D -$^3$He fuelled, aneutronic, thermonuclear fusion
propulsion system. This fusion propulsion concept is based on a magnetically confined field reversed
configuration plasma, where the deuterium propellant is heated by fusion products, and then expanded
into a magnetic nozzle, providing both thrust and electrical energy to the spacecraft [1]. The trajectories
calculations and analysis for the Titan mission are obtained based on the characteristics provided
by the PPPL [1]. Two different profile missions are considered: the first one is a thrust-coast-thrust
profile with constant thrust and specific impulse; the second scenario is a continuous and constant
thrust profile mission. Each mission study is divided into four different phases, starting from
the initial low Earth orbit departure, the interplanetary trajectory, Saturn orbit insertion
and the Titan orbit insertion. For all mission phases, maneuver time and propellant consumption
are calculated. The results of calculations and mission analysis offer a complete overview of the
advantages in term of payload mass and travel time. It is important to emphasize that the deceleration
capability is one of the DFD game changer: in fact, the DFD performance allows to rapidly reach high
velocities and decelerate in even shorter time period. This capability results in a total trip duration
of 2.6 years for the thrust-coast-thrust profile and less than 2 years considering the continuous
thrust profile. The high payload enabling capability, combined with the huge electrical power
available from the fusion reactor, leads to a tremendous advantage compared to present technology.

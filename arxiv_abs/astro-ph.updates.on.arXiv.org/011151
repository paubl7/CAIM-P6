We investigate what drives the redshift evolution of the typical electron density ($n_e$) in star-forming
galaxies, using a sample of 140 galaxies drawn primarily from KMOS$^{\rm 3D}$ ($0.6\lesssim{z}\lesssim{2.6}$)
and 471 galaxies from SAMI ($z<0.113$). We select galaxies that do not show evidence of AGN activity
or outflows, to constrain the average conditions within H II regions. Measurements of the [SII]$\lambda$6716/[SII]$\lambda$6731
ratio in four redshift bins indicate that the local $n_e$ in the line-emitting material decreases
from 187$^{+140}_{-132}$ cm$^{-3}$ at $z\sim$ 2.2 to 32$^{+4}_{-9}$ cm$^{-3}$ at $z\sim$ 0; consistent
with previous results. We use the H$\alpha$ luminosity to estimate the root-mean-square (rms)
$n_e$ averaged over the volumes of star-forming disks at each redshift. The local and volume-averaged
$n_e$ evolve at similar rates, hinting that the volume filling factor of the line-emitting gas may
be approximately constant across $0\lesssim{z}\lesssim{2.6}$. The KMOS$^{\rm 3D}$ and SAMI
galaxies follow a roughly monotonic trend between $n_e$ and star formation rate, but the KMOS$^{\rm
3D}$ galaxies have systematically higher $n_e$ than the SAMI galaxies at fixed offset from the star-forming
main sequence, suggesting a link between the $n_e$ evolution and the evolving main sequence normalization.
We quantitatively test potential drivers of the density evolution and find that $n_e$(rms) $\simeq{n_{H_2}}$,
suggesting that the elevated $n_e$ in high-$z$ H II regions could plausibly be the direct result
of higher densities in the parent molecular clouds. There is also tentative evidence that $n_e$
could be influenced by the balance between stellar feedback, which drives the expansion of H II regions,
and the ambient pressure, which resists their expansion.

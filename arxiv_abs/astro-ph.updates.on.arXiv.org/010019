We present SN 2019tsf (ZTF19ackjszs) and SN 2019oys (ZTF19abucwzt). These two stripped envelope
Type Ib supernovae suddenly showed a (re-)brightening in their late light curves. We investigate
this in the context of circumstellar material (CSM) interaction with previously ejected material,
a phenomenon that is unusual among SE SNe. We analyse observational data, consisting of optical
light curves and spectra. For SN 2019oys we also have detections in radio as well as limits from UV
and X-rays. Both light curves show spectacular re-brightening after about 100 days. In the case
of SN 2019tsf, the re-brightening is followed by a new period of decline, and the spectra never show
signs of narrow emission lines that would indicate CSM interaction. On the contrary, SN 2019oys
made a spectral makeover from a Type Ib to a spectrum clearly dominated by CSM interaction at the light
curve brightening phase. Deep spectra reveal a plethora of narrow high ionization lines, including
coronal lines, and the radio observations show strong emission. The rather similar light curve
behaviour indicate CSM interaction as the powering source. For SN 2019oys the evidence for a phase
where the ejecta hit H-rich material, likely ejected from the progenitor star, is conspicuous.
We observe strong narrow lines of H and He, but also a plethora of high ionization lines, including
coronal lines, revealing shock interaction. Spectral simulations of SN 2019oys show two distinct
density components, one with density > 1e9/cm3, dominated by somewhat broader, low ionization
lines of H I, He I, Na I and Ca II, and one with narrow, high ionization lines at a density about 1e6 /cm3.
The former is strongly affected by electron scattering. The evidence for CSM interaction in SN 2019oys
is corroborated by detections in radio. On the contrary, for SN 2019tsf, we find little evidence
in the spectra for any CSM interaction.

Disintegrating/evaporating rocky exoplanets can be observed not only as transiting planets,
but also in a grazing, non-transiting regime, where the solid body of the planet does not transit,
but part of the comet-like tail can transit. In this case the forward scattering on the escaping particles
is the dominant process, which amplifies the photometric signal of the parent star detected by the
observer. The change in the flux is small, about 10^-3 (1000 ppm) at the best properties of the planetary
system, but if the observation is enough precise, the detection is possible. The planned Ariel space
observatory is designed to achieve a stability of < 100 ppm (the goal is 10 ppm) over the temporal bandwidth
of the transit, typically less than 10 hours. In this case study we took the disintegrating exoplanet
Kepler-1520b and changed the orbital properties of the system to get a grazing, non-transiting
orbit scenario, and investigated, how different particle sizes, species, Ariel observational
channels, and other factors affect the amplitude of the forward-scattering peak, and the detectability
of the scattering event. Our most important result is that the forward-scattering amplitude is
not sensitive to the dust composition, but is very sensitive to the particle size, observational
channel, and other factors. These factors can reduce mainly the detectability of 1-micron grains.
0.1-micron grains will be detectable at short wavelengths. 0.01-micron grains generate long and
very small forward scattering amplitude, which is below the detection limit. Based on our results
we can conclude that using Ariel will be possible to detect and investigate not only transiting,
but also grazing, non-transiting disintegrating exoplanets based on the forward scattering.
From the viewpoint of such objects the big advantage of Ariel will be the possibility of multiwavelength
observations.

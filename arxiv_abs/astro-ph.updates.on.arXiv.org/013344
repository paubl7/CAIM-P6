The formation of globular clusters and their relation to the distribution of dark matter have long
puzzled astronomers. One of the most recently-proposed globular cluster formation channels ties
ancient star clusters to the large-scale streaming velocity of baryons relative to dark matter
in the early Universe. These streaming velocities affect the global infall of baryons into dark
matter halos, the high-redshift halo mass function, and the earliest generations of stars. In some
cases, streaming velocities may result in dense regions of dark-matter-free gas that becomes Jeans
unstable, potentially leading to the formation of compact star clusters. We investigate this hypothesis
using cosmological hydrodynamical simulations that include a full chemical network and the formation
and destruction of H$_2$, a process crucial for the formation of the first stars. We find that high-density
gas in regions with significant streaming velocities -- which constitute approximately 1\% of
the Universe -- is indeed somewhat offset from the centers of dark matter halos, but this offset is
typically significantly smaller than the virial radius. Gas outside of dark matter halos never
reaches Jeans-unstable densities in our simulations. We postulate that low-level ($Z \approx
10^{-3}\,Z_{\odot}$) metal enrichment by Population III supernovae may enable cooling in the
extra-virial regions, allowing gas outside of dark matter halos to cool to the CMB temperature and
become Jeans-unstable. Follow-up simulations that include both streaming velocities and metal
enrichment by Population III supernovae are needed to understand if streaming velocities provide
one path for the formation of globular clusters in the early Universe.

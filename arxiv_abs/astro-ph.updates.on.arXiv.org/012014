Several important mechanisms that explain the coherent pulsar radio emission rely on streaming
(or beam) instabilities of the relativistic pair plasma in a pulsar magnetosphere. However, it
is still not clear whether a streaming instability by itself is sufficient to explain the observed
coherent radio emission. Due to the relativistic conditions that are present in the pulsar magnetosphere,
kinetic instabilities could be quenched. Moreover, uncertainties regarding specific model-dependent
parameters impede conclusions concerning this question. We aim to constrain the possible parameter
range for which a streaming instability could lead to pulsar radio emission, focusing on the transition
between strong and weak beam models, beam drift speed, and temperature dependence of the beam and
background plasma components. We solve a linear relativistic kinetic dispersion relation appropriate
for pulsar conditions in a more general way than in previous studies, considering a wider parameter
range. The analytical results are validated by comparison with relativistic kinetic particle-in-cell
(PIC) numerical simulations. We obtain growth rates as a function of background and beam densities,
temperatures, and streaming velocities while finding a remarkable agreement of the linear dispersion
predictions and numerical simulation results in a wide parameter range. Monotonous growth is found
when increasing the beam-to-background density ratio. With growing beam velocity, the growth
rates firstly increase, reach a maximum and decrease again for higher beam velocities. A monotonous
dependence on the plasma temperatures is found, manifesting in an asymptotic behaviour when reaching
colder temperatures. We show that the generated waves are phase-coherent by calculating the fractional
bandwidth. We provide an explicit parameter range of plasma conditions for efficient pulsar radio
emission.

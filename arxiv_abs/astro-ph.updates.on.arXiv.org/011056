The Ly$\alpha$ forest decomposed into Voigt profile components (or "clouds") allow us to study
clustering properties of the intergalactic medium and its dependence on various physical quantities.
Here, we report the first detections of longitudinal three-point ($\zeta$) and reduced three-point
(Q) correlations of low-$z$ (i.e $z<0.48$) Ly$\alpha$ clouds over a scale of $r_\parallel\leq
4$ pMpc. We measure $\zeta = 6.9\pm 1.3$ and Q = 1.7$\pm$0.4 at a transverse separation of 1-2 pMpc.
We show the amplitude of $\zeta$ increases with increasing HI column density ($N_{\rm HI}$) while
Q does not show any $N_{\rm HI}$ dependence. We find the radial profile of $\zeta$ to be different
for high-$b$ (i.e $b>$40 km/s) and low-$b$ absorbers. About 84% of the triplets contributing to
$\zeta$ have nearby galaxies within a velocity separation of 500 km/s and a median impact parameter
of 405 pkpc. The measured impact parameters are consistent with appreciable number of triplets
not originating from individual galaxies but tracing the underlying galaxy distribution. Frequency
of occurrence of high-$b$ absorbers in triplets ($\sim$88%) is a factor $\sim3$ higher than that
found among the full sample ($\sim$32%). Using four different cosmological simulations, we quantify
the effect of peculiar velocities, feedback effects and show that most of the observed trends can
be broadly reproduced. However, $\zeta$ at small scales ($r_\parallel<1$ pMpc) and $b$-dependence
of $\zeta$ in simulations are found inconsistent with the observations. This could either be related
to the fact that none of these simulations reproduce the observed $b$-distribution and $N_{\rm
HI}$ distribution for $N_{\rm HI}>10^{14}$ cm$^{-2}$ self-consistently or to the widespread
of signal-to-noise ratio in the observed data.

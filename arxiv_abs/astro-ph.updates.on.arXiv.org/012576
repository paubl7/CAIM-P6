Core formation and runaway core collapse in models with self-interacting dark matter (SIDM) significantly
alter the central density profiles of collapsed halos. Using a forward modeling inference framework
with simulated datasets, we demonstrate that flux ratios in quadruple image strong gravitational
lenses can detect the unique structural properties of SIDM halos, and statistically constrain
the amplitude and velocity dependence of the interaction cross section in halos with masses between
$10^6 - 10^{10} M_{\odot}$. Measurements on these scales probe self-interactions at velocities
below $30 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$, a relatively unexplored regime of parameter space, complimenting
constraints at higher velocities from galaxies and clusters. We cast constraints on the amplitude
and velocity dependence of the interaction cross section in terms of $\sigma_{20}$, the cross section
amplitude at $20 \ \rm{km} \ \rm{s^{-1}}$. With 50 lenses, a sample size available in the near future,
and flux ratios measured from spatially compact mid-IR emission around the background quasar,
we forecast $\sigma_{20} < 11-23 \ \rm{cm^2} \rm{g^{-1}}$ at $95 \%$ CI, depending on the amplitude
of the subhalo mass function, and assuming cold dark matter (CDM). Alternatively, if $\sigma_{20}
= 19.2 \ \rm{cm^2}\rm{g^{-1}}$ we can rule out CDM with a likelihood ratio of 20:1, assuming an amplitude
of the subhalo mass function that results from doubly-efficient tidal disruption in the Milky Way
relative to massive elliptical galaxies. These results demonstrate that strong lensing of compact,
unresolved sources can constrain SIDM structure on sub-galactic scales across cosmological distances,
and the evolution of SIDM density profiles over several Gyr of cosmic time.

We investigate how star formation quenching proceeds within central and satellite galaxies using
spatially resolved spectroscopy from the SDSS-IV MaNGA DR15. We adopt a complete sample of star
formation rate surface densities ($\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$), derived in Bluck et al. (2020), to compute
the distance at which each spaxel resides from the resolved star forming main sequence ($\Sigma_{\rm
SFR} - \Sigma_*$ relation): $\Delta \Sigma_{\rm SFR}$. We study galaxy radial profiles in $\Delta
\Sigma_{\rm SFR}$, and luminosity weighted stellar age (${\rm Age_L}$), split by a variety of intrinsic
and environmental parameters. Via several statistical analyses, we establish that the quenching
of central galaxies is governed by intrinsic parameters, with central velocity dispersion ($\sigma_c$)
being the most important single parameter. High mass satellites quench in a very similar manner
to centrals. Conversely, low mass satellite quenching is governed primarily by environmental
parameters, with local galaxy over-density ($\delta_5$) being the most important single parameter.
Utilising the empirical $M_{BH}$ - $\sigma_c$ relation, we estimate that quenching via AGN feedback
must occur at $M_{BH} \geq 10^{6.5-7.5} M_{\odot}$, and is marked by steeply rising $\Delta \Sigma_{\rm
SFR}$ radial profiles in the green valley, indicating `inside-out' quenching. On the other hand,
environmental quenching occurs at over-densities of 10 - 30 times the average galaxy density at
z$\sim$0.1, and is marked by steeply declining $\Delta \Sigma_{\rm SFR}$ profiles, indicating
`outside-in' quenching. Finally, through an analysis of stellar metallicities, we conclude that
both intrinsic and environmental quenching must incorporate significant starvation of gas supply.

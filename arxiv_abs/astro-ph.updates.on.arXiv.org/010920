The gravitational-wave (GW) inspirals of stellar-mass compact objects onto a supermassive black
hole (MBH), are some of the most promising GW sources detectable by next-generation space-born
GW-detectors. The rates and characteristics of such extreme mass ratio inspirals (EMRIs) sources
are highly uncertain. They are determined by the dynamics of stars near MBHs, and the rate at which
compacts objects are driven to the close proximity of the MBH. Here we consider weakly and strongly
mass-segregated nuclear clusters, and the evolution of stars captured into highly eccentric orbits
following binary disruptions by the MBH. We make use of a Monte-Carlo approach to model the diffusion
of both captured objects, and compact-objects brought through two-body relaxation processes.
We calculate the rates of GW-inspirals resulting from relaxation-driven objects, and characterize
EMRIs properties. We correct previous studies and show that relaxation-driven sources produce
GW-sources with lower-eccentricity than previously found, and provide the detailed EMRI eccentricity
distribution in the weak and strong mass-segregation regimes. We also show that binary-disruption
captured-stars could introduce low-eccentricity GW-sources of stellar black-hole EMRIs in mass-segregated
clusters. The eccentricities of the GW-sources from the capture channel, however, are strongly
affected by relaxation processes, and are significantly higher than previously suggested. We
find that both the rate and eccentricity distribution of EMRIs could probe the dynamics near MBHs,
and the contribution of captured stars, characterize the mass-function of stellar compact objects,
and verify whether weak or strong mass-segregation processes take place near MBHs.

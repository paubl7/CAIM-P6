We present a multi-wavelength investigation of a C-class flaring activity that occurred in the
active region NOAA 12734 on 8 March 2019. The investigation utilises data from AIA and HMI on board
the SDO and the Udaipur-CALLISTO solar radio spectrograph of the Physical Research Laboratory.
This low intensity C1.3 event is characterised by typical features of a long duration event (LDE),
viz. extended flare arcade, large-scale two-ribbon structures and twin coronal dimmings. The
eruptive event occurred in a coronal sigmoid and displayed two distinct stages of energy release,
manifested in terms of temporal and spatial evolution. The formation of twin dimming regions are
consistent with the eruption of a large flux rope with footpoints lying in the western and eastern
edges of the coronal sigmoid. The metric radio observations obtained from Udaipur-CALLISTO reveals
a broad-band ($\approx$50-180 MHz), stationary plasma emission for $\approx$7 min during the
second stage of the flaring activity that resemble a type IV radio burst. A type III decametre-hectometre
radio bursts with starting frequency of $\approx$2.5 MHz precedes the stationary type IV burst
observed by Udaipur-CALLISTO by $\approx$5 min. The synthesis of multi-wavelength observations
and Non-Linear Force Free Field (NLFFF) coronal modelling together with magnetic decay index analysis
suggests that the sigmoid flux rope underwent a zipping-like uprooting from its western to eastern
footpoints in response to the overlying asymmetric magnetic field confinement. The asymmetrical
eruption of the flux rope also accounts for the observed large-scale structures viz. apparent eastward
shift of flare ribbons and post flare loops along the polarity inversion line (PIL), and provides
an evidence for lateral progression of magnetic reconnection site as the eruption proceeds.

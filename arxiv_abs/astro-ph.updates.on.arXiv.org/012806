The Spectrometer/Telescope for Imaging X-rays (STIX) is the HXR instrument onboard Solar Orbiter
designed to observe solar flares over a broad range of flare sizes, between 4-150 keV. We report the
first STIX observations of microflares recorded during the instrument commissioning phase in
order to investigate the STIX performance at its detection limit. This first result paper focuses
on the temporal and spectral evolution of STIX microflares occuring in the AR12765 in June 2020,
and compares the STIX measurements with GOES/XRS, SDO/AIA, and Hinode/XRT. For the observed microflares
of the GOES A and B class, the STIX peak time at lowest energies is located in the impulsive phase of
the flares, well before the GOES peak time. Such a behavior can either be explained by the higher sensitivity
of STIX to higher temperatures compared to GOES, or due to the existence of a nonthermal component
reaching down to low energies. The interpretation is inconclusive due to limited counting statistics
for all but the largest flare in our sample. For this largest flare, the low-energy peak time is clearly
due to thermal emission, and the nonthermal component seen at higher energies occurs even earlier.
This suggests that the classic thermal explanation might also be favored for the majority of the
smaller flares. In combination with EUV and SXR observations, STIX corroborates earlier findings
that an isothermal assumption is of limited validity. Future diagnostic efforts should focus on
multi-wavelength studies to derive differential emission measure distributions over a wide range
of temperatures to accurately describe the energetics of solar flares. Commissioning observations
confirm that STIX is working as designed. As a rule of thumb, STIX detects flares as small as the GOES
A class. For flares above the GOES B class, detailed spectral and imaging analyses can be performed.

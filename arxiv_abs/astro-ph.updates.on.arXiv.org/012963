The sunspot umbra harbors the coolest plasma on the solar surface due to the presence of strong magnetic
fields. The routinely used atomic lines to observe the photosphere have weak signals in the umbra
and are often swamped by molecular lines. This makes it harder to infer the properties of the umbra,
especially in the darkest regions. The lines of the Ti I multiplet at 2.2 $\mu$m are formed mainly
at temperatures $\le\!4500$ K and are not known to be affected by molecular blends in sunspots. Since
the first systematic observations in the 1990's, these lines have been seldom observed due to the
instrumental challenges involved at these longer wavelengths. We revisit these lines and investigate
their formation in different solar features. We synthesize the Ti I multiplet using a snapshot from
3D MHD simulation of a sunspot and explore the properties of two of its lines in comparison with two
commonly used iron lines at 630.25 nm and $1.5648\,\mu$m. We find that the Ti I lines have stronger
signals than the Fe I lines in both intensity and polarization in the sunspot umbra and in penumbral
spines. They have little to no signal in the penumbral filaments and the quiet Sun, at $\mu=1$. Their
strong and well-split profiles in the dark umbra are less affected by stray light. Consequently,
inside the sunspot it is easier to invert these lines and to infer the atmospheric properties, compared
to the iron lines. The Cryo-NIRSP instrument at the DKIST will provide the first ever high resolution
observations in this wavelength range. In this preparatory study, we demonstrate the unique temperature
and magnetic sensitivities of the Ti multiplet, by probing the Sun's coolest regions which are not
favourable for the formation of other commonly used spectral lines. We thus expect such observations
to advance our understanding of sunspot properties.

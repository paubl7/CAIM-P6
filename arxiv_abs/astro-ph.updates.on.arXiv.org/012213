Two-moment neutrino transport methods have been widely used for developing theoretical models
of core-collapse supernova (CCSN), since they substantially reduce the computational burden
inherent in the multi-dimensional neutrino-radiation hydrodynamical simulations. The approximation,
however, comes at a price; the detailed structure of angular distribution of neutrinos is sacrificed,
that is the main drawback of this approach. In this paper, we develop a novel method by which to construct
angular distributions of neutrinos from the zero-th and first angular moments. In our method, the
angular distribution is expressed with two quadratic functions of the neutrino angle in a piecewise
fashion. We determine the best parameters in the fitting function by comparing to the neutrino data
in a spherically symmetric CCSN model with full Boltzmann neutrino transport. We demonstrate the
capability of our method by using our recent 2D CCSN model. We find that the essential features of
the angular distributions can be well reconstructed, whereas the angular distributions of incoming
neutrinos tend to have large errors that increase with flux factor ($\kappa$). This issue originates
from the insensitiveness of incoming neutrinos to $\kappa$, that is an intrinsic limitation in
moment methods. Based on the results of the demonstration, we assess the reliability of ELN-crossing
search-methods with two-moment neutrino transport. This analysis is complementary to our another
paper that scrutinizes the limitation of the crossing search with a few moments. We find that the
systematic errors of angular distributions for incoming neutrinos lead to misjudgements of the
crossing at $\kappa \gtrsim 0.5$. This casts doubt on the results of ELN-crossing search based on
two-moment methods in some previous studies.

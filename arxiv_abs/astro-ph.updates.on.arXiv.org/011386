The morphology of galaxies provide us with a unique tool for relating and understanding other physical
properties and their changes over the course of cosmic time. It is only recently that we have been
afforded access to a wealth of data for an unprecedented number galaxies thanks to large and deep
surveys, We present the morphological catalogue of the OTELO survey galaxies detected with the
Hubble Space Telescope (HST)-ACS F814W images. We explore various methods applied in previous
works to separate early-type (ET) and late-type (LT) galaxies classified via spectral energy distribution
(SED) fittings using galaxy templates. Together with this article, we are releasing a catalogue
containing the main morphological parameters in the F606W and F814W bands derived for more than
8\,000 sources. The morphological analysis is based on the single-S\'ersic profile fit. We used
the GALAPAGOS2 software to provide multi-wavelength morphological parameters fitted simultaneously
in two HST-ACS bands. The GALAPAGOS2 software detects, prepares guess values for GALFTI-M, and
provides the best-fitting single-S\'ersic model in both bands for each source. Stellar masses
were estimated using synthetic rest-frame magnitudes recovered from SED fittings of galaxy templates.
The morphological catalogue is complemented with concentration indexes from a separate SExtractor
dual, high dynamical range mode. A total of 8,812 sources were successfully fitted with single-S\'ersic
profiles. The analysis of a carefully selected sample of ~3,000 sources up to phot_z=2 is presented
in this work, of which 873 sources were not detected in previous studies. We found no statistical
evidence for the evolution of the low-mass end of mass-size relation for ET and LT since z=2. Furthermore,
we found a good agreement for the median size evolution for ET and LT galaxies, for a given stellar
mass, with the data from the literature.

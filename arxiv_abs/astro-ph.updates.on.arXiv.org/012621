Although the discovery of the chaotic motion of the inner planets in the solar system dates back to
more than thirty years ago, the secular chaos of their orbits still dares more analytical analyses.
Apart from the high-dimensional structure of the motion, this is probably related to the lack of
an adequately simple dynamical model. Here, we consider a new secular dynamics for the inner planets,
with the aim of retaining a fundamental set of interactions responsible for their chaotic behaviour,
while being consistent with the predictions of the most precise orbital solutions currently available.
We exploit the regularity in the secular motion of the outer planets, to predetermine a quasi-periodic
solution for their orbits. This reduces the secular phase space to the degrees of freedom dominated
by the inner planets. On top of that, the smallness of the inner planet masses and the absence of strong
mean-motion resonances permits to restrict ourselves to first-order secular averaging. The resulting
dynamics can be integrated numerically in a very efficient way through Gauss's method, while computer
algebra allows for analytical inspection of planet interactions, once the Hamiltonian is truncated
at a given total degree in eccentricities and inclinations. The new model matches very satisfactorily
reference orbital solutions of the solar system over timescales shorter than or comparable to the
Lyapunov time. It correctly reproduces the maximum Lyapunov exponent of the inner system and the
statistics of the high eccentricities of Mercury over the next five billion years. The destabilizing
role of the $g_1-g_5$ secular resonance also arises. A numerical experiment, consisting of a thousand
orbital solutions over one hundred billion years, reveals the essential properties of the stochastic
process driving the destabilization of the inner solar system and clarifies its current metastable
state.

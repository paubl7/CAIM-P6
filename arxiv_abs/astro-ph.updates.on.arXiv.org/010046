The 2009 Lunar CRater Observation and Sensing Satellite (LCROSS) impact mission detected water
ice absorption using spectroscopic observations of the impact-generated debris plume taken by
the Shepherding Spacecraft, confirming an existing hypothesis regarding the existence of water
ice in permanently shadowed regions within Cabeus crater. Ground-based observations in support
of the mission were able to further constrain the mass of the debris plume and the concentration of
the water ice ejected during the impact. In this work, we explore additional constraints on the initial
conditions of the pre-impact lunar sediment required in order to produce a plume model that is consistent
with the ground-based observations. We match the observed debris plume lightcurve using a layer
of dirty ice with an ice concentration that increases with depth, a layer of pure regolith, and a layer
of material at about 6 meters below the lunar surface that would otherwise have been visible in the
plume but has a high enough tensile strength to resist excavation. Among a few possible materials,
a mixture of regolith and ice with a sufficiently high ice concentration could plausibly produce
such a behavior. The vertical albedo profiles used in the best fit model allows us to calculate a pre-impact
mass of water ice within Cabeus crater of $5 \pm 3.0 \times 10^{11}$ kg and a mass concentration of
water in the lunar sediment of $8.2 \pm 0.001$ %wt, assuming a water ice albedo of 0.8 and a lunar regolith
density of 1.5 g cm$^{-3}$, or a mass concentration of water of $4.3 \pm 0.01$ %wt, assuming a lunar
regolith density of 3.0. These models fit to ground-based observations result in derived masses
of regolith and water ice within the debris plume that are consistent with \emph{in situ} measurements,
with a model debris plume ice mass of 108 kg.

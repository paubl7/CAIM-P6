CK Vul is the remnant of an energetic eruption known as Nova 1670 that is thought to be caused by a stellar
merger. The remnant is composed of (1) a large hourglass nebula of recombining gas (of 71\arcsec
size), very similar to some classical planetary and pre-planetary nebulae (PPNe), and (2) of a much
smaller and cooler inner remnant prominent in millimeter-wave emission from molecules. We investigate
the three-dimensional spatio-kinematic structure of both components. The analysis of the hourglass
structure yields a revised distance to the object of >2.6 kpc, at least 3.7 times greater than so far
assumed. At this distance, the stellar remnant has a bolometric luminosity >12 L$_{\odot}$ and
is surrounded by molecular material of total mass >0.8 M$_{\odot}$ (the latter value has a large
systematic uncertainty). We also analyzed the architecture of the inner molecular nebula using
ALMA observations of rotational emission lines obtained at subarcsecond resolution. We find that
the distribution of neutral and ionized gas in the lobes can be reproduced by several nested and incomplete
shells or jets with different velocity fields and varying orientations. The analysis indicates
that the molecular remnant was created in several ejection episodes, possibly involving an interacting
binary system. We calculated the linear momentum ($\approx$10$^{40}$ g cm s$^{-1}$) and kinetic
energy ($\approx$10$^{47}$ erg) of the CK Vul outflows and find them within the limits typical for
classical PPNe. Given the similarities of the CK Vul outflows to PPNe, we suggest there may CK Vul
analogs among wrongly classified PPNe with low intrinsic luminosities, especially among PPNe
with post-red-giant-branch central stars.

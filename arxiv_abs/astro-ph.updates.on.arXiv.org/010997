Medium-resolution integral-field spectrographs (IFS) coupled with adaptive-optics such as
Keck/OSIRIS, VLT/MUSE, or SINFONI are appearing as a new avenue for enhancing the detection and
characterization capabilities of young, gas giant exoplanets at large heliocentric distances
(>5 au). We analyzed K-band VLT/SINFONI medium-resolution (R_lambda~5577) observations of the
young giant exoplanet HIP 65426 b. Our dedicated IFS data analysis toolkit (TExTRIS) optimized
the cube building, star registration, and allowed for the extraction of the planet spectrum. A Bayesian
inference with the nested sampling algorithm coupled with the self-consistent forward atmospheric
models BT-SETTL15 and Exo-REM using the ForMoSA tool yields Teff=1560 +/- 100K, log(g)<4.40dex,
[M/H]=0.05 +/- 0.22dex, and an upper limit on the C/O ratio (<0.55). The object is also re-detected
with the so-called "molecular mapping" technique. The technique yields consistent atmospheric
parameters, but the loss of the planet pseudo-continuum in the process degrades or modifies the
constraints on these parameters. The solar to sub-solar C/O ratio suggests an enrichment by solids
at formation if the planet was formed beyond the water snowline (>20 au) by core-accretion. However,
a formation by gravitational instability can not be ruled out. The metallicity is compatible with
the bulk enrichment of massive Jovian planets from the Bern planet population models. Finally,
we measure a radial velocity of 26 +/- 15km/s compatible with our revised measurement on the star.
This is the fourth imaged exoplanet for which a radial velocity can be evaluated, illustrating the
potential of such observations for assessing the coevolution of imaged systems belonging to star
forming regions, such as HIP 65426.

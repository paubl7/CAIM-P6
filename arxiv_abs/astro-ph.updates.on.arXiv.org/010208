We recently presented a new statistical method to constrain the physics of star formation and feedback
on the cloud scale by reconstructing the underlying evolutionary timeline. However, by itself
this new method only recovers the relative durations of different evolutionary phases. To enable
observational applications, it therefore requires knowledge of an absolute 'reference time-scale'
to convert relative time-scales into absolute values. The logical choice for this reference time-scale
is the duration over which the star formation rate (SFR) tracer is visible because it can be characterised
using stellar population synthesis (SPS) models. In this paper, we calibrate this reference time-scale
using synthetic emission maps of several SFR tracers, generated by combining the output from a hydrodynamical
disc galaxy simulation with the SPS model SLUG2. We apply our statistical method to obtain self-consistent
measurements of each tracer's reference time-scale. These include H${\alpha}$ and 12 ultraviolet
(UV) filters (from GALEX, Swift, and HST), which cover a wavelength range 150-350 nm. At solar metallicity,
the measured reference time-scales of H${\alpha}$ are ${4.32^{+0.09}_{-0.23}}$ Myr with continuum
subtraction, and 6-16 Myr without, where the time-scale increases with filter width. For the UV
filters we find 17-33 Myr, nearly monotonically increasing with wavelength. The characteristic
time-scale decreases towards higher metallicities, as well as to lower star formation rate surface
densities, owing to stellar initial mass function sampling effects. We provide fitting functions
for the reference time-scale as a function of metallicity, filter width, or wavelength, to enable
observational applications of our statistical method across a wide variety of galaxies.

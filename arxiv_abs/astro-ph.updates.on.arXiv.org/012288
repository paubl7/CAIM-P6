Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) are extremely energetic pulses of millisecond duration and unknown origin.
In order to understand the phenomenon that emits these pulses, targeted and untargeted searches
have been performed for multi-wavelength counterparts, including the optical. The objective
of this work is to search for optical transients at the position of 8 well-localized FRBs, after the
arrival of the burst on different time-scales (typically at one day, several months, and one year
after FRB detection) in order to compare with known transient optical light curves. We used the Las
Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network (LCOGT), which allows us to promptly take images
owing to its network of twenty-three telescopes working around the world. We used a template subtraction
technique on all the images we collected at different epochs. We have divided the subtractions into
two groups, in one group we use the image of the last epoch as a template and in the other group we use
the image of the first epoch as a template. We have searched for bright optical transients at the localizations
of the FRBs (<1 arcsec) in the template subtracted images. We have found no optical transients, so
we have set limiting magnitudes of optical counterparts. Typical limiting magnitudes in apparent
(absolute) magnitudes for our LCOGT data are ~22 (-19) mag in the r-band. We have compared our limiting
magnitudes with light curves of superluminous supernovae (SLSNe), type Ia supernovae (SNe), supernovae
associated with gamma-ray bursts (GRB SNe), a kilonova, and tidal disruption events (TDEs). We
rule out that FRBs are associated with SLSN at a confidence of ~99.9%. We can also rule out the brightest
sub-types of type Ia SNe, GRB SNe and TDEs (under some conditions) at similar confidence, though
we cannot exclude scenarios where FRBs are associated with the faintest sub-type of each of these
transient classes.

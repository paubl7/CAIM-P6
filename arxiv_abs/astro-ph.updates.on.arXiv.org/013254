Gaia's Early Third Data Release (EDR3) does not contain new radial velocities because these will
be published in Gaia's full third data release (DR3), expected in the first half of 2022. To maximise
the usefulness of EDR3, Gaia's second data release (DR2) sources (with radial velocities) are matched
to EDR3 sources to allow their DR2 radial velocities to also be included in EDR3. This presents two
considerations: (i) arXiv:1901.10460 (hereafter B19) published a list of 70,365 sources with
potentially contaminated DR2 radial velocities; and (ii) EDR3 is based on a new astrometric solution
and a new source list, which means sources in DR2 may not be in EDR3. EDR3 contains 7,209,831 sources
with a DR2 radial velocity, which is 99.8% of sources with a radial velocity in DR2. 14,800 radial
velocities from DR2 are not propagated to any EDR3 sources because (i) 3871 from the B19 list are found
to either not have an unpublished, preliminary DR3 radial velocity or it differs significantly
from its DR2 value, and 5 high-velocity stars not in the B19 list are confirmed to have contaminated
radial velocities; and (ii) 10,924 DR2 sources could not be satisfactorily matched to any EDR3 sources,
so their DR2 radial velocities are also missing from EDR3. The reliability of radial velocities
in EDR3 has improved compared to DR2 because the update removes a small fraction of erroneous radial
velocities (0.05% of DR2 radial velocities and 5.5% of the B19 list). Lessons learnt from EDR3 (e.g.
bright star contamination) will improve the radial velocities in future Gaia data releases. The
main reason for radial velocities from DR2 not propagating to EDR3 is not related to DR2 radial velocity
quality. It is because the DR2 astrometry is based on one component of close binary pairs, while EDR3
astrometry is based on the other component, which prevents these sources from being unambiguously
matched. (Abridged)

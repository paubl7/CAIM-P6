Statistical studies of astronomical data sets, in particular of cataloged properties for discrete
objects, are central to astrophysics. One cannot model those objects' population properties or
incidences without a quantitative understanding of the conditions under which these objects ended
up in a catalog or sample, the sample's selection function. As systematic and didactic introductions
to this topic are scarce in the astrophysical literature, we aim to provide one, addressing generically
the following questions: What is a selection function? What arguments $\vec{q}$ should a selection
function depend on? Over what domain must a selection function be defined? What approximations
and simplifications can be made? And, how is a selection function used in `modelling'? We argue that
volume-complete samples, with the volume drastically curtailed by the faintest objects, reflect
a highly sub-optimal selection function that needlessly reduces the number of bright and usually
rare objects in the sample. We illustrate these points by a worked example, deriving the space density
of white dwarfs (WD) in the Galactic neighbourhood as a function of their luminosity and Gaia color,
$\Phi_0(M_G,B-R)$ in [mag$^{-2}$pc$^{-3}$]. We construct a sample of $10^5$ presumed WDs through
straightforward selection cuts on the Gaia EDR3 catalog, in magnitude, color, parallax, and astrometric
fidelity $\vec{q}=(m_G,B-R,\varpi,p_{af})$. We then combine a simple model for $\Phi_0$ with
the effective survey volume derived from this selection function $S_C(\vec{q})$ to derive a detailed
and robust estimate of $\Phi_0(M_G,B-R)$. This resulting white dwarf luminosity-color function
$\Phi_0(M_G,B-R)$ differs dramatically from the initial number density distribution in the luminosity-color
plane: by orders of magnitude in density and by four magnitudes in density peak location.

We describe the atomic and molecular data that were used for the abundance analyses of FGK-type stars
carried out within the Gaia-ESO Survey. We present an unprecedented effort to create a homogeneous
line list, which was used by several abundance analysis groups to calculate synthetic spectra and
equivalent widths. The atomic data are accompanied by quality indicators and detailed references
to the sources. The atomic and molecular data are made publicly available in electronic form. In
general experimental transition probabilities were preferred but theoretical values were also
used. Astrophysical gf-values were avoided due to the model-dependence of such a procedure. For
elements whose lines are significantly affected by hyperfine structure or isotopic splitting
a concerted effort has been made to collate the necessary data for the individual line components.
We also performed a detailed investigation of available data for line broadening due to collisions
with neutral hydrogen atoms. Synthetic spectra calculated for the Sun and Arcturus were used to
assess the blending properties of the lines. Among a subset of over 1300 lines of 35 elements in the
wavelength ranges from 475 nm to 685 nm and from 850 nm to 895 nm we identified about 200 lines of 24 species
which have accurate gf-values and are free of blends in the spectra of the Sun and Arcturus. For the
broadening due to collisions with neutral hydrogen we recommend data based on Anstee-Barklem-O'Mara
theory, where available, and to avoid lines of neutral species otherwise. Theoretical broadening
data by R.L. Kurucz should be used for Sc II, Ti II, and Y II lines. For ionised rare-earth species the
Uns\"old approximation with an enhancement factor of 1.5 for the line width can be used. Desirable
improvements in atomic data were identified for a number of species, including Al I, S I, Cr II, Na
I, Si I, Ca II, and Ni I.

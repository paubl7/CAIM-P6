IGR J17091--3624 is a transient galactic black hole which has a distinct quasi-periodic variability
known as `heartbeat', similar to the one observed in GRS 1915+105. In this paper, we report the results
of $\sim 125$ ks \textit{AstroSat} observations of this source during the 2016 outburst. For the
first time a double peaked QPO (DPQ) is detected in a few time segments of this source with a difference
of $\delta f ~\sim12$ mHz between the two peaks. The nature of the DPQ was studied based on hardness
ratios and using the static as well as the dynamic power spectrum. Additionally, a low frequency
(25--48 mHz) `heartbeat' single peak QPO (SPQ) was observed at different intervals of time along
with harmonics ($50-95$ mHz). Broadband spectra in the range $0.7-23$ keV, obtained with \textit{SXT}
and \textit{LAXPC}, could be fitted well with combination of a thermal Comptonisation and a multicolour
disc component model. During \textit{AstroSat} observation, the source was in the Soft-Intermediate
State (SIMS) as observed with \textit{Swift/XRT}. We present a comparative study of the `heartbeat'
state variability in IGR J17091--3624 with GRS 1915+105. Significant difference in the timing
properties is observed although spectral parameters ($\Gamma\sim2.1-2.4$ and $T_\mathrm{max}\sim0.6-0.8$
keV) in the broad energy band remain similar. Spectral properties of segments exhibiting SPQ and
DPQ are further studied using simple phase resolved spectroscopy which does not show a significant
difference. Based on the model parameters, we obtain the maximum ratio of mass accretion rate in
GRS 1915+105 to that in IGR J17091--3624 as $\sim25:1$. We discuss the implications of our findings
and comment on the physical origin of these exotic variabilities.

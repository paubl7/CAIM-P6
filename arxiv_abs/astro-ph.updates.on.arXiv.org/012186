We report on the results of multi-wavelength follow-up observations with Gemini, VLA, and ATCA,
to search for a host galaxy and any persistent radio emission associated with FRB 180309. This FRB
is among the most luminous FRB detections to date, with a luminosity of $> 8.7\times 10^{32}$ erg
Hz$^{-1}$ at the dispersion-based redshift upper limit of 0.32. We used the high-significance
detection of FRB 180309 with the Parkes Telescope and a beam model of the Parkes Multibeam Receiver
to improve the localization of the FRB to a region spanning approximately $\sim2'\times2'$. We
aimed to seek bright galaxies within this region to determine the strongest candidates as the originator
of this highly luminous FRB. We identified optical sources within the localization region above
our r-band magnitude limit of 24.27, fourteen of which have photometric redshifts whose fitted
mean is consistent with the redshift upper limit ($z < 0.32$) of our FRB. Two of these galaxies are
coincident with marginally detected "persistent" radio sources of flux density 24.3$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$
and 22.1$\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$ respectively. Our redshift-dependent limit on the luminosity of
any associated persistent radio source is comparable to the luminosity limits for other localized
FRBs. We analyze several properties of the candidate hosts we identified, including chance association
probability, redshift, and presence of radio emission, however it remains possible that any of
these galaxies could be the host of this FRB. Follow-up spectroscopy on these objects to explore
their H$\alpha$ emission and ionization contents, as well as to obtain more precisely measured
redshifts, may be able to isolate a single host for this luminous FRB.

Supernovae (SNe) dominate the energy and momentum budget of stellar feedback, but the efficiency
with which they couple to the interstellar medium (ISM) depends strongly on how effectively early,
pre-SN feedback clears dense gas from star-forming regions. There are observational constraints
on the magnitudes and timescales of early stellar feedback in low ISM pressure environments, yet
no such constraints exist for more cosmologically typical high ISM pressure environments. In this
paper, we determine the mechanisms dominating the expansion of HII regions as a function of size-scale
and evolutionary time within the high-pressure ($P/k_\rm{B}$~$10^{7-8}$K cm$^{-3}$) environment
in the inner 100pc of the Milky Way. We calculate the thermal pressure from the warm ionised ($P_\rm{HII}$;
10$^{4}$K) gas, direct radiation pressure ($P_\rm{dir}$), and dust processed radiation pressure
($P_\rm{IR}$). We find that (1) $P_\rm{dir}$ dominates the expansion on small scales and at early
times (0.01-0.1pc; $<$0.1Myr); (2) the expansion is driven by $P_\rm{HII}$ on large scales at later
evolutionary stages ($>0.1$pc; $>1$Myr); (3) during the first ~1Myr of growth, but not thereafter,
either $P_{\rm IR}$ or stellar wind pressure likely make a comparable contribution. Despite the
high confining pressure of the environment, natal star-forming gas is efficiently cleared to radii
of several pc within ~2Myr, i.e. before the first SNe explode. This `pre-processing' means that
subsequent SNe will explode into low density gas, so their energy and momentum will efficiently
couple to the ISM. We find the HII regions expand to a radius of 3pc, at which point they have internal
pressures equal with the surrounding external pressure. A comparison with HII regions in lower
pressure environments shows that the maximum size of all HII regions is set by pressure equilibrium
with the ambient ISM.

We present a detailed analysis of time variability of two distinct C IV broad absorption line (BAL)
components seen in the spectrum of J162122.54+075808.4 ($z_{em}$ = 2.1394) using observations
from SDSS, NTT and SALT taken at seven different epochs spanning about 15 years. The blue-BAL component
(with an ejection velocity, $v_{\rm e}\sim37,500$ kms$^{-1}$) is an emerging absorption that
shows equivalent width variations and kinematic shifts consistent with acceleration. The red-BAL
component ($v_{\rm e} \sim 15,400$ kms$^{-1}$) is a three component absorption. One of the components
is emerging and subsequently disappearing. The two other components show kinematic shifts consistent
with acceleration coupled with equivalent width variability. Interestingly, we find the kinematic
shifts and equivalent width variability of the blue- and red-BAL components to be correlated. While
the C IV emission line flux varies by more than 17% during our monitoring period, the available light-curves
(covering rest frame 1300-2300 angstrom do not show more than a 0.1 mag variability in the continuum.
This suggests that the variations in the ionizing flux are larger than that of the near-UV flux. However,
the correlated variability seen between different BAL components cannot be explained solely by
photoionization models without structural changes. In the framework of disk wind models, any changes
in the radial profiles of density and/or velocity triggered either by disk instabilities or by changes
in the ionizing radiation can explain our observations. High resolution spectroscopic monitoring
of J1621+0758 is important to understand the physical conditions of the absorbing gas and thereby
to constrain the parameters of disk-wind models.

We present an ALMA 1.3 mm (Band 6) continuum survey of lensed submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) at $z=1.0\sim3.2$
with an angular resolution of $\sim0.2$". These galaxies were uncovered by the Herschel Lensing
Survey (HLS), and feature exceptionally bright far-infrared continuum emission ($S_\mathrm{peak}
\gtrsim 90$ mJy) owing to their lensing magnification. We detect 29 sources in 20 fields of massive
galaxy clusters with ALMA. Using both the Spitzer/IRAC (3.6/4.5 $\mathrm{\mu m}$) and ALMA data,
we have successfully modeled the surface brightness profiles of 26 sources in the rest-frame near-
and far-infrared. Similar to previous studies, we find the median dust-to-stellar continuum size
ratio to be small ($R_\mathrm{e,dust}/R_\mathrm{e,star} = 0.38\pm0.14$) for the observed SMGs,
indicating that star formation is centrally concentrated. This is, however, not the case for two
spatially extended main-sequence SMGs with a low surface brightness at 1.3 mm ($\lesssim 0.1$ mJy
arcsec$^{-2}$), in which the star formation is distributed over the entire galaxy ($R_\mathrm{e,dust}/R_\mathrm{e,star}>1$).
As a whole, our SMG sample shows a tight anti-correlation between ($R_\mathrm{e,dust}/R_\mathrm{e,star}$)
and far-infrared surface brightness ($\Sigma_\mathrm{IR}$) over a factor of $\simeq$ 1000 in
$\Sigma_\mathrm{IR}$. This indicates that SMGs with less vigorous star formation (i.e., lower
$\Sigma_\mathrm{IR}$) lack central starburst and are likely to retain a broader spatial distribution
of star formation over the whole galaxies (i.e., larger $R_\mathrm{e,dust}/R_\mathrm{e,star}$).
The same trend can be reproduced with cosmological simulations as a result of central starburst
and potentially subsequent "inside-out" quenching, which likely accounts for the emergence of
compact quiescent galaxies at $z\sim2$.

We describe the BeyondPlanck project in terms of motivation, methodology and main products, and
provide a guide to a set of companion papers that describe each result in fuller detail. Building
directly on experience from ESA's Planck mission, we implement a complete end-to-end Bayesian
analysis framework for the Planck Low Frequency Instrument (LFI) observations. The primary product
is a joint posterior distribution P(omega|d), where omega represents the set of all free instrumental
(gain, correlated noise, bandpass etc.), astrophysical (synchrotron, free-free, thermal dust
emission etc.), and cosmological (CMB map, power spectrum etc.) parameters. Some notable advantages
of this approach are seamless end-to-end propagation of uncertainties; accurate modeling of both
astrophysical and instrumental effects in the most natural basis for each uncertain quantity;
optimized computational costs with little or no need for intermediate human interaction between
various analysis steps; and a complete overview of the entire analysis process within one single
framework. As a practical demonstration of this framework, we focus in particular on low-l CMB polarization
reconstruction, paying special attention to the LFI 44 GHz channel. We find evidence of significant
residual systematic effects that are still not accounted for in the current processing, but must
be addressed in future work. These include a break-down of the 1/f correlated noise model at 30 and
44 GHz, and scan-aligned stripes in the Southern Galactic hemisphere at 44 GHz. On the Northern hemisphere,
however, we find that all results are consistent with the LCDM model, and we constrain the reionization
optical depth to tau = 0.067 +/- 0.016, with a low-resolution chi-squared probability-to-exceed
of 16%. The marginal CMB dipole amplitude is 3359.5 +/- 1.9 uK. (Abridged.)

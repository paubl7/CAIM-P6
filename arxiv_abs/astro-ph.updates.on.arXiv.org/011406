The H.E.S.S. Galactic Plane Survey (HGPS) revealed 78 TeV sources among which 47 are not clearly
associated with a known object. We present a multiwavelength approach to constrain the origin of
the emission from unidentified HGPS sources. We present a generic pipeline that explores a large
database of multiwavelength archival data toward any region in the Galactic plane. Along with a
visual inspection of the retrieved multiwavelength observations to search for faint and uncataloged
counterparts, we derive a radio spectral index that helps disentangle thermal from nonthermal
emission and a mean magnetic field through X-ray and TeV data in case of a leptonic scenario. We also
search for a spectral connection between the GeV and the TeV regimes with the Fermi-LAT cataloged
sources that may be associated with the unidentified HGPS source. We complete the association procedure
with catalogs of known objects and with the source catalogs from instruments whose data are retrieved.
The method is applied on two unidentified sources, namely HESS J1427$-$608 and HESS J1458$-$608,
for which the multiwavelength constraints favor the pulsar wind nebula (PWN) scenario. We model
their broadband nonthermal spectra in a leptonic scenario with a magnetic field $B \lesssim 10$
$\mu$G, which is consistent with that obtained from ancient PWNe. We place both sources within the
context of the TeV PWN population to estimate the spin-down power and the characteristic age of the
putative pulsar. We also shed light on two possibly significant $\gamma$-ray excesses in the HGPS:
the first is located in the south of the unidentified source HESS J1632$-$478 and the second is spatially
coincident with the synchrotron-emitting supernova remnant G28.6$-$0.1. The multiwavelength
counterparts found toward both $\gamma$-ray excesses make these promising candidates for being
new very-high energy $\gamma$-ray sources.

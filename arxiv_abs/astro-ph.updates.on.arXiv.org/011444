In this work, we study the potential of the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) for the detection of Galactic
dark matter (DM) subhalos. We focus on low-mass subhalos that do not host any baryonic content and
therefore lack any multiwavelength counterpart. If the DM is made of weakly interacting massive
particles (WIMPs), these dark subhalos may thus appear in the gamma-ray sky as unidentified sources.
A detailed characterization of the instrumental response of CTA to dark subhalos is performed,
for which we use the {\it ctools} analysis software and simulate CTA observations under different
array configurations and pointing strategies, such as the scheduled extragalactic survey. This,
together with information on the subhalo population as inferred from N-body cosmological simulations,
allows us to predict the CTA detectability of dark subhalos, i.e., the expected number of subhalos
in each of the considered observational scenarios. In the absence of detection, for each observation
strategy we set competitive limits to the annihilation cross section as a function of the DM particle
mass, that are at the level of $\langle\sigma v\rangle\sim4\times10^{-24}$ ($7\times10^{-25}$)
$\mathrm{cm^3s^{-1}}$ for the $b\bar{b}$ ($\tau^+\tau^-$) annihilation channel in the best
case scenario. Interestingly, we find the latter to be reached with no dedicated observations,
as we obtain the best limits by just accumulating exposure time from all scheduled CTA programs and
pointings over the first 10 years of operation. This way CTA will offer the most constraining limits
from subhalo searches in the intermediate range between $\sim 1-3$ TeV, complementing previous
results with \textit{Fermi}-LAT and HAWC at lower and higher energies, respectively.

Testing 3D hydrodynamic models of stellar atmospheres is feasible by retrieving spectral line
shapes across stellar disks, using differential spectroscopy during exoplanet transits. From
synthetic data at hyper-high spectral resolution, characteristic patterns for FeI and FeII lines
were identified in Paper IV from 3D models spanning T=3964-6726K (spectral types approx. K8V-F3V).
The observability of patterns among lines of different strength, excitation potential and ionization
level are now examined, as observed at ordinary spectral resolutions and in the presence of noise.
Time variability in 3D atmospheres induces changes in spectral-line parameters, some of which
are correlated. An adequate calibration could identify proxies for the jitter in apparent radial
velocity to enable adjustments to actual stellar radial motion. We also examined the center-to-limb
temporal variability. Recovery of spatially resolved line profiles with fitted widths and depths
is shown for various noise levels. Signals during exoplanet transit are simulated. In addition
to Rossiter-McLaughlin type signatures in apparent radial velocity, analogous effects are shown
for line depths and widths. From exoplanet transits, overall stellar line parameters of width,
depth and wavelength position can be retrieved already with moderate efforts, but a very good signal-to-noise
ratio is required to reveal the more subtle signatures between subgroups of spectral lines, where
finer details of atmospheric structure are encoded. In a solar model, temporal variability shows
correlations between jittering in apparent radial velocity and fluctuations in line depth. Since
both fluctuations in line depth and jittering in wavelength can be measured from the ground, searches
for low-mass exoplanets should explore these to adjust apparent radial velocities to actual stellar
motion.

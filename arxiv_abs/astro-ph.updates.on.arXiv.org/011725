A recently observed bump in the cosmic ray (CR) spectrum from 0.3--30 TV is likely caused by a stellar
bow shock that reaccelerates \emph{preexisting} CRs, which further propagate to the Sun along
the magnetic field lines. Along their way, these particles generate an Iroshnikov-Kraichnan (I-K)
turbulence that controls their propagation and sustains the bump. {\it Ad hoc} fitting of the bump
shape requires six adjustable parameters. Our model requires none, merely depending on \emph{three
physical unknowns that we constrain using the fit.} These are the shock Mach number, $M$, its size,
$l_{\perp}$, and the distance to it, $\zeta_{\text{obs}}$. Altogether, they define the bump rigidity
$R_{0}$. With $M$$\approx$1.5--1.6 and $R_{0}$$\approx$4.4 TV, the model fits the data with $\approx$$0.08\%$
accuracy. The fit critically requires the I-K spectrum predicted by the model and rules out the alternatives.
These fit's attributes make an accidental agreement highly unlikely. In turn, $R_{0}$ and $M$ derived
from the fit impose the distance-size %($\zeta_{{\rm obs}}$$-$$l_{\perp}$) relation on the shock:
$\zeta_{{\rm obs}}$(pc)$\sim$$10^{2}\sqrt{l_{\perp}(\text{pc})}$. For sufficiently large
bow shocks, $l_{\perp}$$=$$10^{-3}$$-$$10^{-2}$ pc, we find the distance of $\zeta_{{\rm obs}}$$=$3--10
pc. Three promising stars in this range are: Scholz's Star at 6.8 pc, Epsilon Indi at 3.6 pc, and Epsilon
Eridani at 3.2 pc. Based on their current positions and velocities, we propose that Epsilon Indi
and Epsilon Eridani can produce the observed spectral bump. Moreover, Epsilon Eridani's position
is only $\sim$$6.7^{\circ}$ off of the magnetic field direction in the solar neighborhood, which
also changes the CR arrival direction distribution. Given the proximity of these stars, the bump
appearance may change in a relatively short time.

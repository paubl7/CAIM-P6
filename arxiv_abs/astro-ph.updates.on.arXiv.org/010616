We compare the number of lunar craters larger than 15 km across and younger than 1.1 Ga to the estimates
of the number of craters that could have been formed for 1.1 Ga if the number of near-Earth objects
and their orbital elements during that time were close to the corresponding current values. The
comparison was performed for craters over the entire lunar surface and in the region of the Oceanus
Procellarum and maria on the near side of the Moon. In these estimates, we used the values of collision
probabilities of near-Earth objects with the Moon and the dependences of the crater diameters on
the impactor sizes. According to the estimates made by different authors, the number density of
known Copernican craters with diameters D>15 km in mare regions is at least double the corresponding
number for the remaining lunar surface. Our estimates do not contradict the growth in the number
of near-Earth objects after probable catastrophic fragmentations of large main-belt asteroids,
which may have occurred over the recent 300 Ma; however, they do not prove this increase. Particularly,
they do not conflict with the inference made by Mazrouei et al. (2019) that 290 Ma ago the frequency
of collisions of near-Earth asteroids with the Moon increased by 2.6 times. For a probability of
a collision of an Earth-crossing object (ECO) with the Earth in a year equaled to 10^-8, our estimates
of the number of craters agree with the model, according to which the number densities of the 15-km
Copernican craters for the whole lunar surface would have been the same as that for mare regions if
the data by Losiak et al. (2015) for D<30 km were as complete as those for D>30 km. With this collision
probability of ECOs with the Earth and for this model, the cratering rate may have been constant over
the recent 1.1 Ga.

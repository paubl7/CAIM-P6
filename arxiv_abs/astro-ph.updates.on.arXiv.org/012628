Context. Bulge globular clusters (BGCs) are exceptional tracers of the formation and chemodynamical
evolution of this oldest Galactic component. However, until now, observational difficulties
have prevented us from taking full advantage of these powerful Galactic archeological tools. Aims.
CAPOS, the bulge Cluster APOgee Survey, addresses this key topic by observing a large number of BGCs,
most of which have only been poorly studied previously. Even their most basic parameters, such as
metallicity, [{\alpha}/Fe], and radial velocity, are generally very uncertain. We aim to obtain
accurate mean values for these parameters, as well as abundances for a number of other elements,
and explore multiple populations. In this first paper, we describe the CAPOS project and present
initial results for seven BGCs. Methods. CAPOS uses the APOGEE-2S spectrograph observing in the
H band to penetrate obscuring dust toward the bulge. For this initial paper, we use abundances derived
from ASPCAP, the APOGEE pipeline. Results. We derive mean [Fe/H] values of $-$0.85$\pm$0.04 (Terzan
2), $-$1.40$\pm$0.05 (Terzan 4), $-$1.20$\pm$0.10 (HP 1), $-$1.40$\pm$0.07 (Terzan 9), $-$1.07$\pm$0.09
(Djorg 2), $-$1.06$\pm$0.06 (NGC 6540), and $-$1.11$\pm$0.04 (NGC 6642) from three to ten stars
per cluster. We determine mean abundances for eleven other elements plus the mean [$\alpha$/Fe]
and radial velocity. CAPOS clusters significantly increase the sample of well-studied Main Bulge
globular clusters (GCs) and also extend them to lower metallicity. We reinforce the finding that
Main Bulge and Main Disk GCs, formed in situ, have [Si/Fe] abundances slightly higher than their
accreted counterparts at the same metallicity. We investigate multiple populations and find our
clusters generally follow the light-element (anti)correlation trends of previous studies of
GCs of similar metallicity. We finally explore the abundances ...

The SVOM mission under development will carry various instruments, and in particular the coded-mask
telescope ECLAIRs, with a large field of view of about 2 sr, operating in the 4--150 keV energy band,
whose goal is to detect high energy transients such as gamma-ray bursts. The trigger software onboard
ECLAIRs will search for new hard X-ray sources appearing in the sky, as well as peculiar behaviour
(e.g. strong outbursts) from known sources, in order to repoint the satellite to perform follow-up
observations with its onboard narrow field of view instruments. The presence of known X-ray sources
must be disentangled from the appearance of new sources. This is done with the help of an onboard source
catalogue, which we present in this paper. As an input we use catalogues of X-ray sources detected
by Swift/BAT and MAXI/GSC and we study the influence of the sources on ECLAIRs' background level
and on the quality of the sky image reconstruction process. We show that the influence of the sources
depends on the pointing direction on the sky, on the energy band and on the exposure time. In the Galactic
centre, the known sources contribution largely dominates the cosmic X-ray background, which is,
on the contrary, the main background in sky regions empty of strong sources. We also demonstrate
the need to clean the sources contributions in order to maintain a low noise level in the sky images
and to keep the threshold applied for the detection of new sources as low as possible, without introducing
false triggers. We briefly describe one of our cleaning methods and its challenges. Finally, we
present the overall structure of the onboard catalogue and the way it will be used to perform the source
cleaning and disentangle the detections of new sources from outbursts of known sources.

Magnetic fields influence the formation and evolution of stars and impact the observed stellar
properties. Ap stars (magnetic A-type stars) are a prime example of this. Access to precise and accurate
determinations of their stellar fundamental properties, such as masses and ages, is crucial to
understand the origin and evolution of fossil magnetic fields. We propose using the radii and luminosities
determined from interferometric measurements, in addition to seismic constraints when available,
to infer fundamental properties of 14 Ap stars pr\'eviously characterised. We used a grid-based
modelling approach, employing stellar models computed with the \textsc{cestam} stellar evolution
code, and the parameter search performed with the \textsc{aims} optimisation method. The stellar
model grid was built using a wide range of initial helium abundances and metallicities in order to
avoid any bias originating from the initial chemical composition. The large frequency separations
($\Delta\nu$) of HR\,1217 (HD\,24712) and $\alpha$~Cir (HD\,128898), two rapidly oscillating
Ap stars of the sample, were used as seismic constraints. We inferred the fundamental properties
of the 14 stars in the sample. The overall results are consistent within $1\sigma$ with previous
studies, however, the stellar masses inferred in this study are higher. This trend likely originates
from the broader range of chemical compositions considered in this work. We show that the use of $\Delta\nu$
in the modelling significantly improves our inferences, allowing us to set reasonable constraints
on the initial metallicity which is, otherwise, unconstrained. This gives an indication of the
efficiency of atomic diffusion in the atmospheres of roAp stars and opens the possibility of characterising
the transport of chemical elements in their interiors.

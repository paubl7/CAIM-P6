For the purpose of investigating the differential rotation of the solar corona, we analyzed ultraviolet
(UV) spectral line observations acquired on both the east and west limbs at 1.7 $R_{\odot}$ by SOHO/UVCS
during the solar minimum preceding solar cycle 23. To obtain a reliable and statistically robust
picture of the rotational profile, we used a set of simultaneous 400-day long spectral line intensities
of five different spectral lines: O VI 1032 A, O VI 1037 A, Si XII 499 A, Si XII 521 A, and H I 1216 A, which
are routinely observed by UVCS. The data were analyzed by means of two different techniques: the
generalized Lomb-Scargle periodogram (GLS) and a multivariate data-adaptive technique called
multichannel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA). Among many other positive outcomes, this latter
method is unique in its ability to recognize common oscillatory modes between the five time series
observed at both limbs. The latitudinal rotation profile obtained in this work emphasizes that
the low-latitude region of the UV corona (about $\pm 20^{\circ}$ from the solar equator) exhibits
differential rotation, while the higher-latitude structures do rotate quasi-rigidly. The differential
rotation rate of the solar corona as evinced at low-latitudes is consistent with the rotational
profile of the near-surface convective zone of the Sun, suggesting that the rotation of the corona
at 1.7 $R_{\odot}$ is linked to intermediate-scale magnetic bipole structures anchored near 0.99
$R_{\odot}$. The quasi-rigid rotation rate found at mid and high latitudes is instead attributed
to the influence of large-scale coronal structures linked to the rigidly rotating coronal holes.
We further suggest that the methodology presented in this paper could represent a milestone for
future investigations on differential rotation rates when dealing with simultaneous multiwavelength
data.

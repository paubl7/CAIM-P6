Several mechanisms for the transformation of blue star-forming to red quiescent galaxies have
been proposed, and the green valley (GV) galaxies amid them are widely accepted in a transitional
phase. Thus, comparing the morphological and environmental differences of the GV galaxies with
early-type disks (ETDs; bulge dominated and having a disk) and late-type disks (LTDs; disk dominated)
is suitable for distinguishing the corresponding quenching mechanisms. A large population of
massive ($M_* \geqslant 10^{10}M_\odot$) GV galaxies at $0.5 \leqslant z \leqslant 1.5$ in 3D-HST/CANDELS
is selected using extinction-corrected $(U-V)_{\rm rest}$ color. After eliminating any possible
active galactic nucleus candidates and considering the "mass-matching", we finally construct
two comparable samples of GV galaxies with either 319 ETD or 319 LTD galaxies. Compared to the LTD
galaxies, it is found that the ETD galaxies possess higher concentration index and lower specific
star formation rate, whereas the environments surrounding them are not different. This may suggest
that the morphological quenching may dominate the star formation activity of massive GV galaxies
rather than the environmental quenching. To quantify the correlation between the galaxy morphology
and the star formation activity, we define a dimensionless morphology quenching efficiency $Q_{\rm
mor}$ and find that $Q_{\rm mor}$ is not sensitive to the stellar mass and redshift. When the difference
between the average star formation rate of ETD and LTD galaxies is about 0.7 $M_\odot \rm \;yr^{-1}$,
the probability of $Q_{\rm mor}\gtrsim 0.2$ is higher than 90\%, which implies that the degree of
morphological quenching in GV galaxies might be described by $Q_{\rm mor}\gtrsim 0.2$.

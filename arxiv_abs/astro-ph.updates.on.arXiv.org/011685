M dwarfs are key targets for high-resolution spectroscopic analyses due to a high incidence of these
stars in the solar neighbourhood and their importance as exoplanetary hosts. Several methodological
challenges make such analyses difficult, leading to significant discrepancies in the published
results. We compare M dwarf parameters derived by recent high-resolution near-infrared studies
with each other and with fundamental stellar parameters. We also assess to what extent deviations
from local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) for Fe and K influence the outcome of these studies.
We carry out line formation calculations based on a modern model atmosphere grid along with a synthetic
spectrum synthesis code that treats formation of atomic and molecular lines in cool-star atmospheres
including departures from LTE. We use near-infrared spectra collected with the CRIRES instrument
at the ESO VLT as reference observational data. We find that the effective temperatures obtained
by the different studies mostly agree to better than 100 K. We see a much worse agreement in the surface
gravities and metallicities. We demonstrate that non-LTE effects are negligible for Fe I in M-dwarf
atmospheres but are important for K I. These effects, leading to K abundance and metallicity corrections
on the order of 0.2 dex, may be responsible for some of the discrepancies in the published analyses.
Differences in the temperature-pressure structures of the atmospheric models may be another factor
contributing to the discrepancies, in particular at low metallicities and high effective temperatures.
In high-resolution spectroscopic studies of M dwarfs attention should be given to details of the
line formation physics as well as input atomic and molecular data. Collecting high-quality, wide
wavelength coverage spectra of benchmark M dwarfs is an essential future step.

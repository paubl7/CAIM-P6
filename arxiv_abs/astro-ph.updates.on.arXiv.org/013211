Accretion disks of active galactic nuclei (AGN) have been proposed as promising sites for producing
both (stellar-mass) compact object mergers and extreme mass ratio inspirals. Along with the disk-assisted
migration/evolution process, ambient gas materials inevitably accrete onto the compact objects.
The description of this process is subject to significant theoretical uncertainties in previous
studies. It was commonly assumed that either an Eddington accretion rate or a Bondi accretion rate
(or any rate in between) takes place, although these two rates can differ from each other by several
orders of magnitude. As a result, the mass and spin evolution of compact objects within AGN disks
are essentially unknown. In this work, we construct a relativistic supercritical inflow-outflow
model for black hole (BH) accretion. We show that the radiation efficiency of the supercritical
accretion of a stellar-mass BH (sBH) is generally too low to explain the proposed electromagnetic
counterpart of GW190521. Applying this model to sBHs embedded in AGN disks, we find that, although
the gas inflow rates at Bondi radii of these sBHs are in general highly super-Eddington, a large fraction
of inflowing gas eventually escapes as outflows so that only a small fraction accretes onto the sBH,
resulting in mildly super-Eddington BH absorption in most cases. We also implement this inflow-outflow
model to study the evolution of neutron stars (NS) and white dwarfs (WD) in AGN disks, taking into
account corrections from star sizes and star magnetic fields. It turns out to be difficult for WDs
to grow to the Chandrasekhar limit via accretion because WDs are spun up more efficiently to reach
the shedding limit before the Chandrasekhar limit. For NSs the accretion-induced collapse is possible
if NS magnetic fields are sufficiently strong, keeping the NS in a slow rotation state during accretion.

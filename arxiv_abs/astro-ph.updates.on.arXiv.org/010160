Owing to narrow energy band of \textit{Swift}/BAT, several urgent issues are required to pay more
attentions but unsolved so far. We systematically study the properties of a refined sample of 283
\textit{Swift}/BAT gamma-ray bursts with well-measured spectral peak energy ($E_{\text p}$)
at a high confidence level larger than 3$\sigma$. It is interestingly found that duration ($T_{90}$)
distribution of \textit{Swift} bursts still exhibits an evident bimodality with a more reliable
boundary of $T_{90}\simeq$1.06 s instead of 2 s for previously contaminated samples including
bursts without well-peaked spectra, which is very close to $\sim$1.27 s and $\sim$0.8 s suggested
by some authors for Fermi/GBM and \textit{Swift}/BAT catalogs, respectively. The \textit{Swift}/BAT
short and long bursts have comparable mean $E_{\text p}$ values of $87^{+112}_{-49}$ and $85^{+101}_{-46}$
keV in each, similar to what found for both types of BATSE bursts, which manifests the traditional
short-hard/long-soft scheme may not be tenable for the certain energy window of a detector. In statistics,
we also investigate the consistency of distinct methods for the $E_{\text p}$ estimates and find
that Bayesian approach and BAND function can always give consistent evaluations. In contrast,
the frequently-used cut-off power-law model matches two other methods for lower $E_{\text p}$
and will overestimate the $E_{\text p}$ more than 70\% as $E_{\text p}>$100 keV. Peak energies of
X-ray flashes, X-ray rich bursts and classical gamma-ray bursts could have an evolutionary consequence
from thermal-dominated to non-thermal-dominated radiation mechanisms. Finally, we find that
the $E_{\text p}$ and the observed fluence ($S_{\gamma}$) in the observer frame are correlated
as $E_p\simeq [S_{\gamma}/(10^{-5} erg\ cm^{-2})]^{0.28}\times 117.5^{+44.7}_{-32.4}$ keV
proposed to be an useful indicator of GRB peak energies.

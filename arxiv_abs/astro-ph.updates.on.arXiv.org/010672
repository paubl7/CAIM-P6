NGC 4330 is one of the Virgo galaxies whose UV distribution shows a tail structure. An associated
tail structure is also observed in the HI and H$\alpha$ emission distributions. Previous dynamical
modeling showed that the galaxy is approaching the cluster center and is therefore undergoing increasing
ram pressure stripping. Recent stellar population fitting of deep optical spectra together with
multiband photometry lead to the determination of the time when star formation was quenched in the
galactic disk. We introduce a new version of the dynamical model that includes the diffuse ionized
gas and aim to reproduce the HI, H$\alpha$, UV distributions together with the star formation histories
of the outer gas-free parts of the galactic disk. The results of 50 simulations with five different
Lorentzian temporal ram-pressure profiles and five different delays between the simulation onset
and peak ram pressure are presented. The inclusion of diffuse gas stripping changes significantly
the HI, UV, and H$\alpha$ emission distributions. The simulations with diffuse gas stripping naturally
lead to vertical low surface density filaments in the downwind region of the galactic disk. These
filaments occur less frequently in the simulations without diffuse gas stripping. The simulations
with diffuse gas stripping lead to better joint fits to the SEDs and optical spectra. The HI, NUV,
and H$\alpha$ morphologies of the model snapshots which best reproduce the SEDs and optical spectra
are sufficiently different to permit a selection of best-fit models. We conclude that the inclusion
of diffuse gas stripping significantly improves the resemblance between the model and observations.
Our preferred model yields a time to peak ram pressure of 140 Myr in the future. The spatial coincidence
of the radio continuum and diffuse H$\alpha$ tails suggests that both gas phases are stripped together.

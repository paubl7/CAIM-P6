We present a large high-resolution study of the distribution and evolution of CIV absorbers, including
the weakest population with equivalent widths $W_r<0.3$~{\AA}. By searching 369 high-resolution,
high signal-to-noise spectra of quasars at $1.1\leq z_{em} \leq5.3$ from Keck/HIRES and VLT/UVES,
we find $1268$ CIV absorbers with $W_r \geq 0.05$~{\AA} (our $\sim50\%$ completeness limit) at
redshifts $1\leq z \leq4.75$. A Schechter function describes the observed equivalent width distribution
with a transition from power-law to exponential decline at $W_r \gtrsim 0.5$~{\AA}. The power-law
slope $\alpha$ rises by $\sim7\%$ and transition equivalent width $W_{\star}$ falls by $\sim\!20\%$
from $\langle z \rangle=1.7$ to $\langle z \rangle=3.6$. We find that the co-moving redshift path
density, $dN/dX$, of $W_r \geq 0.05$~{\AA} absorbers rises by $\sim1.8$ times from $z\simeq 4.0$
to $z\simeq 1.3$, while the $W_r \geq 0.6$~{\AA} $dN/dX$ rises by a factor of $\sim8.5$. We quantify
the observed evolution by a model in which $dN/dX$ decreases linearly with redshift. The model suggests
that populations with larger $W_r$ thresholds evolve faster with redshift and appear later in the
universe. The cosmological Technicolor Dawn simulations at $z=3-5$ over-produce the observed
abundance of absorbers with $W_r<0.3$~{\AA}, while yielding better agreement at higher $W_r$.
Our empirical linear model successfully describes {CIV evolution in the simulations and the observed
evolution of $W_r \geq 0.6$~{\AA} CIV for the past $\sim12$ Gyr. Combining our measurements with
the literature gives us a picture of CIV-absorbing structures becoming more numerous and/or larger
in physical size over the last $\approx13$ Gyr of cosmic time ($z\sim6$ to $z\sim0$).

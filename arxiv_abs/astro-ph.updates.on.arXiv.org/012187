We use the PPMAP (Point Process MAPping) algorithm to re-analyse the \textit{Herschel} and SCUBA-2
observations of the L1688 and L1689 sub-regions of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud. PPMAP delivers
maps with high resolution (here $14''$, corresponding to $\sim 0.01\,{\rm pc}$ at $\sim 140\,{\rm
pc}$), by using the observations at their native resolutions. PPMAP also delivers more accurate
dust optical depths, by distinguishing dust of different types and at different temperatures.
The filaments and prestellar cores almost all lie in regions with $N_{\rm H_2}\gtrsim 7\times 10^{21}\,{\rm
cm}^{-2}$ (corresponding to $A_{_{\rm V}}\gtrsim 7$). The dust temperature, $T$, tends to be correlated
with the dust opacity index, $\beta$, with low $T$ and low $\beta$ tend concentrated in the interiors
of filaments. The one exception to this tendency is a section of filament in L1688 that falls -- in
projection -- between the two B stars, S1 and HD147889; here $T$ and $\beta$ are relatively high,
and there is compelling evidence that feedback from these two stars has heated and compressed the
filament. Filament {\sc fwhm}s are typically in the range $0.10\,{\rm pc}$ to $0.15\,{\rm pc}$.
Most filaments have line densities in the range $25\,{\rm M_{_\odot}\,pc^{-1}}$ to $65\,{\rm
M_{_\odot}\,pc^{-1}}$. If their only support is thermal gas pressure, and the gas is at the canonical
temperature of $10\,{\rm K}$, the filaments are highly supercritical. However, there is some evidence
from ammonia observations that the gas is significantly warmer than this, and we cannot rule out
the possibility of additional support from turbulence and/or magnetic fields. On the basis of their
spatial distribution, we argue that most of the starless cores are likely to disperse (rather than
evolving to become prestellar).

Based on MaNGA integral field unit (IFU) spectroscopy we search 60 AGN candidates, which have stellar
masses $M_{\star}\leqslant5\times10^{9}$$M_{\odot}$ and show AGN ionization signatures in
the BPT diagram. For these AGN candidates, we derive the spatially resolved stellar population
with the stellar population synthesis code STARLIGHT and measure the gradients of the mean stellar
age and metallicity. We find that the gradients of mean stellar age (metallicity) of individual
AGN-host dwarfs are diverse in 0-0.5 Re, 0.5-1 Re and 0-1 Re. However, the overall behavior of the
mean stellar age (metallicity) profiles tend to be flat, as the median values of the gradients are
close to zero. We further study the overall behavior of the mean stellar age (metallicity) by plotting
the co-added radial profiles for the AGN sample and compare with a control sample with similar stellar
mass. We find that the median values of light-weighted mean stellar ages of AGN sample are as old as
2-3 ~Gyr within 2 Re,which are about 4-7 times older than those of the control sample. Meanwhile,
most of the AGN candidates are low-level AGNs, as only eight sources have L[OIII]>$10^{39.5}$~erg~s$^{-1}$.
Hence, the AGNs in dwarf galaxies might accelerate the evolution of galaxies by accelerating the
consumption of the gas, resulting in an overall quenching of the dwarf galaxies, and the AGNs also
become weak due to the lack of gas. The median values of mass-weighted mean stellar age of both samples
within 2 $Re$ are similar and as old as about 10~Gyr, indicating that the stellar mass is mainly contributed
by old stellar populations.The gradients of co-added mean stellar metallicity for both samples
tend to be negative but close to zero, and the similar mean stellar metallicity profiles for both
samples indicate that the chemical evolution of the host galaxy is not strongly influenced by the
AGN.

Modern multiwavelength observations of star-forming regions that reveal highly-structured
molecular clouds require adequate extraction methods that would provide both detection of the
structures and their accurate measurements. Omnipresence of filamentary structures and their
physical connection to prestellar cores demand methods that are able to disentangle and extract
both sources and filaments. It is fundamentally important to test all extraction methods to compare
their detection and measurement qualities and fully understand their capabilities, before their
scientific applications. A recent publication described getsf, the new method for source and filament
extraction that employs separation of the structural components, a successor to getsources, getfilaments,
and getimages (collectively referred to as getold). This paper describes a detailed benchmarking
of both getsf and getold using two multicomponent, multiwavelength benchmarks resembling the
Herschel observations of the nearby star-forming regions. Each benchmark consists of simulated
images at six Herschel wavelengths and one additional surface density image with a 13 arcsec resolution.
The structural components of the benchmarks include a background cloud, a dense filament, hundreds
of starless and protostellar cores, and instrumental noise. Five variants of benchmark images
of different complexity are used to perform the source and filament extractions with getsf and getold.
A formalism for evaluating source detection and measurement qualities is presented, allowing
quantitative comparisons of extraction methods in terms of their completeness, reliability,
and goodness, as well as the detection and measurement accuracies and the overall quality. A detailed
analysis shows that getsf has better qualities than getold and that the best choice for source detection
is the high-resolution surface density.

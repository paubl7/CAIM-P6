We report the early discovery and multi-color ($BVI$) high-cadence light curve analyses of a rapidly-declining
sub-Chandrasekhar Type Ia supernova KSP-OT-201509b (= AT2015cx) from the KMTNet Supernova Program.
The Phillips parameter and color stretch parameter of KSP-OT-201509b (= AT2015cx) are $\Delta$$M_{B,15}$
$\simeq$ 1.62 mag and $s_{BV}$ $\simeq$ 0.54, respectively, at an inferred redshift of 0.072. These,
together with other measured parameters (such as the strength of the secondary $I$-band peak, colors
and luminosity), identify the source to be a rapidly-declining Type Ia of transitional nature that
is closer to Branch Normal than 91bg-like. Its early light curve evolution and bolometric luminosity
are consistent with those of homologously expanding ejecta powered by radioactive decay and a Type
Ia SN explosion with 0.32 $\pm$ 0.01 $M_{\odot}$ of synthesized $^{56}$Ni mass, 0.84 $\pm$ 0.12
$M_{\odot}$ of ejecta mass and (0.61 $\pm$ 0.14) $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg of ejecta kinetic energy.
While its $B-V$ and $V-I$ colors evolve largely synchronously with the changes in the $I$-band light
curve as found in other supernovae, we also find the presence of an early redward evolution in $V-I$
prior to --10 days since peak. The bolometric light curve of the source is compatible with a stratified
$^{56}$Ni distribution extended to shallow layers of the exploding progenitor. Comparisons between
the observed light curves and those predicted from ejecta-companion interactions clearly disfavor
Roche Lobe-filling companion stars at large separation distances, thus supporting a double-degenerate
scenario for its origin. The lack of any apparent host galaxy in our deep stack images reaching a sensitivity
limit of $\sim$ 28 $\rm mag\;arcsec^{-2}$ makes KSP-OT-201509b a hostless Type Ia supernova and
offers new insights into supernova host galaxy environments.

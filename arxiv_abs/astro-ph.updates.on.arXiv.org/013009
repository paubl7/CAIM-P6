We investigate whether the considerable diversity in the satellite populations of nearby Milky
Way (MW)-mass galaxies is connected with the diversity in their host's merger histories. Analyzing
8 nearby galaxies with extensive observations of their satellite populations and stellar halos,
we characterize each galaxy's merger history using the metric of its most dominant merger, $M_{\rm
\star,Dom}$, defined as the greater of either its total accreted stellar mass or most massive current
satellite. We find an unexpectedly tight relationship between these galaxies' number of $M_{V}\,{<}\,{-}9$
satellites within 150 kpc ($N_{\rm Sat}$) and $M_{\rm \star,Dom}$. This relationship remains
even after accounting for differences in galaxy mass. Using the star formation and orbital histories
of satellites around the MW and M81, we demonstrate that both likely evolved along the $M_{\rm\star,Dom}{-}N_{\rm
Sat}$ relation during their current dominant mergers with the LMC and M82, respectively. We investigate
the presence of this relation in galaxy formation models, including using the FIRE simulations
to directly compare to the observations. We find no relation between $M_{\rm\star,Dom}$ and $N_{\rm
Sat}$ in FIRE, and a universally large scatter in $N_{\rm Sat}$ with $M_{\rm \star,Dom}$ across
models $-$ in direct contrast with the tightness of the empirical relation. This acute difference
in the observed and predicted scaling relation between two fundamental galaxy properties signals
that current simulations do not sufficiently reproduce diverse merger histories and their effects
on satellite populations. Explaining the emergence of this relation is therefore essential for
obtaining a complete understanding of galaxy formation.

Recent observations have revealed interstellar features that apparently connect energetic activity
in the central region of our Galaxy to its halo. The nature of these features, however, remains largely
uncertain. We present a Chandra mapping of the central 2x4 square degree field of the Galaxy, revealing
a complex of X-ray-emitting threads plus plume-like structures emerging from the Galactic center
(GC). This mapping shows that the northern plume or fountain is offset from a well-known radio lobe
(or the GCL), which however may represent a foreground HII region, and that the southern plume is
well wrapped by a corresponding radio lobe recently discovered by MeerKAT. In particular, we find
that a distinct X-ray thread, G0.17-0.41, is embedded well within a nonthermal radio filament,
which is locally inflated. This thread with a width of ~1.6" (FWHM) is ~6 pc long at the distance of
the GC and has a spectrum that can be characterized by a power law or an optically-thin thermal plasma
with temperature ~3 keV. The X-ray-emitting material is likely confined within a strand of magnetic
field with its strength > 1 mG, not unusual in such radio filaments. These morphological and spectral
properties of the radio/X-ray association suggest that magnetic field re-connection is the energy
source. Such re-connection events are probably common when flux tubes of antiparallel magnetic
fields collide and/or become twisted in and around the diffuse X-ray plumes, representing blowout
superbubbles driven by young massive stellar clusters in the GC. The understanding of the process,
theoretically predicted in analog to solar flares, can have strong implications for the study of
interstellar hot plasma heating, cosmic-ray acceleration and turbulence.

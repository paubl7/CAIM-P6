We present the four-year survey results of monthly submillimeter monitoring of eight nearby ($<
500 $pc) star-forming regions by the JCMT Transient Survey. We apply the Lomb-Scargle Periodogram
technique to search for and characterize variability on 295 submillimeter peaks brighter than
0.14 Jy beam$^{-1}$, including 22 disk sources (Class II), 83 protostars (Class 0/I), and 190 starless
sources. We uncover 18 secular variables, all of them protostars. No single-epoch burst or drop
events and no inherently stochastic sources are observed. We classify the secular variables by
their timescales into three groups: Periodic, Curved, and Linear. For the Curved and Periodic cases,
the detectable fractional amplitude, with respect to mean peak brightness, is $\sim4$ % for sources
brighter than $\sim$ 0.5 Jy beam$^{-1}$. Limiting our sample to only these bright sources, the observed
variable fraction is 37 % (16 out of 43). Considering source evolution, we find a similar fraction
of bright variables for both Class 0 and Class I. Using an empirically motivated conversion from
submillimeter variability to variation in mass accretion rate, six sources (7 % of our full sample)
are predicted to have years-long accretion events during which the excess mass accreted reaches
more than 40 % above the total quiescently accreted mass: two previously known eruptive Class I sources,
V1647 Ori and EC 53 (V371 Ser), and four Class 0 sources, HOPS 356, HOPS 373, HOPS 383, and West 40. Considering
the full protostellar ensemble, the importance of episodic accretion on few years timescale is
negligible, only a few percent of the assembled mass. However, given that this accretion is dominated
by events of order the observing time-window, it remains uncertain as to whether the importance
of episodic events will continue to rise with decades-long monitoring.

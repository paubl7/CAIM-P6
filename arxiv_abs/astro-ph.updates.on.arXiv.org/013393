In \citet{Stangalini20} and \citet{Deb20}, magnetic oscillations were detected in the chromosphere
of a large sunspot and found to be linked to the coronal locations where a First Ionization Potential
(FIP) effect was observed. In an attempt to shed light onto the possible excitation mechanisms of
these localized waves, we further investigate the same data by focussing on the relation between
the spatial distribution of the magnetic wave power and the overall field geometry and plasma parameters
obtained from multi-height spectropolarimetric non-local thermodynamic equilibrium (NLTE)
inversions of IBIS data. We find that, in correspondence with the locations where the magnetic wave
energy is observed at chromospheric heights, the magnetic fields have smaller scale heights, meaning
faster expansions of the field lines, which ultimately results in stronger vertical density stratification
and wave steepening. In addition, the acoustic spectrum of the oscillations at the locations where
magnetic perturbations are observed is broader than that observed at other locations, which suggests
an additional forcing driver to the p-modes. Analysis of the photospheric oscillations in the sunspot
surroundings also reveals a broader spectrum in between the two opposite polarities of the active
region (the leading spot and the trailing opposite polarity plage), and on the same side where magnetic
perturbations are observed in the umbra. We suggest that strong photospheric perturbations in
between the two polarities are responsible for this broader spectrum of oscillations, with respect
to the $p$-mode spectrum, resulting in locally-excited acoustic waves that, after crossing the
equipartition layer, located close to the umbra-penumbra boundary at photopheric heights, are
converted into magnetic-like waves and steepen due to the strong density gradient.

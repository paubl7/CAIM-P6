Nuclear star clusters (NSCs) are a common phenomenon in galaxy centres and are found in a vast majority
of galaxies of intermediate stellar mass $10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$. Recent investigations suggest
that they are rarely found in the least and most massive galaxies and that the nucleation fraction
increases in dense environments. It is unclear whether this trend holds true for field galaxies
due to the limited data currently available. Here we present our results on the nucleation fraction
for 601 galaxies in the Local Volume ($\lesssim 12$ Mpc). Covering more than eight orders of magnitude
in stellar mass, this is the largest sample of galaxies analysed in a low-density environment. Within
the Local Volume sample we find a strong dependence of the nucleation fraction on galaxy stellar
mass, in agreement with previous work. We also find that for galaxies with $M_{\star} < 10^{9}$ M$_{\odot}$,
early-type galaxies have a higher nucleation fraction than late-types. The nucleation fraction
in the Local Volume correlates independently with stellar mass, Hubble type, and local environmental
density. We compare our data to those in galaxy cluster environments (Coma, Fornax, and Virgo) by
compiling previous results and calculating stellar masses in a homogeneous way. We find significantly
lower nucleation fractions (up to 40$\%$) in galaxies with $M_{\star} \lesssim 10^{9.5}$ M$_{\odot}$,
in agreement with previous work. Our results reinforce the connection between globular clusters
and NSCs, but it remains unclear if it can explain the observed trends with Hubble type and local environment.
We speculate that correlation between the nucleation fraction and cluster environment weakens
for the densest clusters like Coma and Virgo.

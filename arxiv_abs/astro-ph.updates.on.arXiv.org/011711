The so-called aromatic infrared bands are attributed to emission of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons.
The observed variations toward different regions in space are believed to be caused by contributions
of different classes of PAH molecules, i.e. with respect to their size, structure, and charge state.
Laboratory spectra of members of these classes are needed to compare them to observations and to
benchmark quantum-chemically computed spectra of these species. In this paper we present the experimental
infrared spectra of three different PAH dications, naphthalene$^{2+}$, anthracene$^{2+}$,
and phenanthrene$^{2+}$, in the vibrational fingerprint region 500-1700~cm$^{-1}$. The dications
were produced by electron impact ionization of the vapors with 70 eV electrons, and they remained
stable against dissociation and Coulomb explosion. The vibrational spectra were obtained by IR
predissociation of the PAH$^{2+}$ complexed with neon in a 22-pole cryogenic ion trap setup coupled
to a free-electron infrared laser at the Free-Electron Lasers for Infrared eXperiments (FELIX)
Laboratory. We performed anharmonic density-functional theory calculations for both singly
and doubly charged states of the three molecules. The experimental band positions showed excellent
agreement with the calculated band positions of the singlet electronic ground state for all three
doubly charged species, indicating its higher stability over the triplet state. The presence of
several strong combination bands and additional weaker features in the recorded spectra, especially
in the 10-15~$\mu$m region of the mid-IR spectrum, required anharmonic calculations to understand
their effects on the total integrated intensity for the different charge states. These measurements,
in tandem with theoretical calculations, will help in the identification of this specific class
of doubly-charged PAHs as carriers of AIBs.

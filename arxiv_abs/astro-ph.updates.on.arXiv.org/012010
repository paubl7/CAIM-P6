We investigate the validity of Taylor's Hypothesis (TH) in the analysis of Alfv\'enic fluctuations
of velocity and magnetic fields in solar wind streams measured by Parker Solar Probe (PSP)~during
the first four encounters. We use PSP velocity and magnetic field measurements from 24 h intervals
selected from each of the first four encounters. The applicability of TH is investigated by measuring
the parameter $\epsilon=\delta u_0/\sqrt{2}V_\perp$, which quantifies the ratio between the
typical speed of large-scale fluctuations, $\delta u_0$, and the local perpendicular PSP speed
in the solar wind frame, $V_\perp$. TH is expected to be applicable for $\epsilon\lesssim0.5$ when
PSP is moving nearly perpendicular to the local magnetic field in the plasma frame, irrespective
of the Alfv\'en Mach number $M_{\rm A}=V_{\rm SW}/V_{\rm A}$, where $V_{\rm SW}$ and $V_{\rm A}$
are the local solar wind and Alfv\'en speed, respectively. For the four selected solar wind intervals
we find that between 10% to 60% of the time the parameter $\epsilon$ is below 0.2 when the sampling
angle (between the spacecraft velocity in the plasma frame and the local magnetic field) is greater
than $30^\circ$. For angles above $30^\circ$, the sampling direction is sufficiently oblique
to allow one to reconstruct the reduced energy spectrum $E(k_\perp)$ of magnetic fluctuations
from its measured frequency spectra. The spectral indices determined from power-law fits of the
measured frequency spectrum accurately represent the spectral indices associated with the underlying
spatial spectrum of turbulent fluctuations in the plasma frame. Aside from a frequency broadening
due to large-scale sweeping that requires careful consideration, the spatial spectrum can be recovered
to obtain the distribution of fluctuation's energy among scales in the plasma frame.

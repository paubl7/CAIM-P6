The landscape of black hole (BH) formation -- which massive stars explode as core-collapse supernovae
(CCSN) and which implode to BHs -- profoundly affects the IMF-averaged nucleosynthetic yields
of a stellar population. Building on the work of Sukhbold et al. (2016), we compute IMF-averaged
yields at solar metallicity for a wide range of assumptions, including neutrino-driven engine
models with extensive BH formation, models with a simple mass threshold for BH formation, and a model
in which all stars from $8-120 \text{M}_{\odot}$ explode. For plausible choices, the overall yields
of $\alpha$-elements span a factor of three, but changes in relative yields are more subtle, typically
$0.05-0.2$ dex. For constraining the overall level of BH formation, ratios of C and N to O or Mg are
promising diagnostics. For distinguishing complex, theoretically motivated landscapes from
simple mass thresholds, abundance ratios involving Mn or Ni are promising because of their sensitivity
to the core structure of the CCSN progenitors. We confirm previous findings of a substantial (factor
$2.5-4$) discrepancy between predicted O/Mg yield ratios and observationally inferred values,
implying that models either overproduce O or underproduce Mg. No landscape choice achieves across-the-board
agreement with observed abundance ratios; the discrepancies offer empirical clues to aspects
of massive star evolution or explosion physics still missing from the models. We find qualitatively
similar results using the massive star yields of Limongi & Chieffi (2018). We provide tables of IMF-integrated
yields for several landscape scenarios, and more flexible user-designed models can be implemented
through the publicly available $\texttt{Versatile Integrator for Chemical Evolution}$ ($\texttt{VICE}$;

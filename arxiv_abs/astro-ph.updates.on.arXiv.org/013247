The observations of global stellar oscillations of post main-sequence stars by space-based photometry
missions allowed to directly determine their internal rotation. These constraints have pointed
towards the existence of angular momentum transport processes unaccounted for in theoretical
models. Constraining the properties of their internal rotation thus appears as the golden path
to determine the physical nature of these missing dynamical processes. We wish to determine the
robustness of a new approach to study the internal rotation of post main-sequence stars, using parametric
rotation profiles coupled to a global optimization technique. We test our methodology on Kepler
56, a red giant observed by the Kepler mission. First, we carry out an extensive modelling of the star
using global and local minimizations techniques, and seismic inversions. Then, using our best
model, we study in details its internal rotation profile, we adopted a Bayesian approach to constrain
stellar parametric predetermined rotation profiles using a Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis
of the rotational splittings of mixed modes. Our Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis of the rotational
splittings allows to determine the core and envelope rotation of Kepler 56 as well as give hints about
the location of the transition between the slowly rotating envelope and the fast rotating core.
We are able to discard a rigid rotation profile in the radiative regions followed by a power-law in
the convective zone and show that the data favours a transition located in the radiative region,
as predicted by processes originating from a turbulent nature. Our analysis of Kepler 56 indicates
that turbulent processes whose transport efficiency is reduced by chemical gradients are favoured,
while large scale fossil magnetic fields are disfavoured as a solution to the missing angular momentum
transport.

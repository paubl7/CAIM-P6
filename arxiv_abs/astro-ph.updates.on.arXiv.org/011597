One important feature of sunspots is the presence of light bridges. These structures are elongated
and bright (as compared to the umbra) features that seem to be related to the formation and evolution
of sunspots. In this work, we studied the long-term evolution and the stratification of different
atmospheric parameters of three light bridges formed in the same host sunspot by different mechanisms.
To accomplish this, we used data taken with the GREGOR Infrared Spectrograph installed at the GREGOR
telescope. These data were inverted to infer the physical parameters of the atmosphere where the
observed spectral profiles were formed of the three light bridges. We find that, in general, the
behaviour of the three light bridges is typical of this kind of structure with the magnetic field
strength, inclination, and temperature values between the values at the umbra and the penumbra.
We also find that they are of a significantly non-magnetic character (particularly at the axis of
the light bridges) as it is deduced from the filling factor. In addition, within the common behaviour
of the physical properties of light bridges, we observe that each one exhibits a particular behaviour.
Another interesting result is that the light bridge cools down, the magnetic field decreases, and
the magnetic field lines get more inclined higher in the atmosphere. Finally, we studied the magnetic
and non-magnetic line-of-sight velocities of the light bridges. The former shows that the magnetic
component is at rest and, interestingly, its variation with optical depth shows a bi-modal behaviour.
For the line-of-sight velocity of the non-magnetic component, we see that the core of the light bridge
is at rest or with shallow upflows and clear downflows sinking through the edges.

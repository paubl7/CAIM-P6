Since the launch of the Fermi Gamma-Ray Space Telescope, several hundred of gamma-ray pulsars have
been discovered, some being radio-loud and some radio-quiet with time-aligned radio and gamma-ray
light-curves. In the $2^\mathrm{nd}$ Fermi Pulsar Catalogue (2PC), 117 new gamma-ray pulsars
have been reported by using three years of data collected by the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the
Fermi satellite, providing a wealth of information such as the peak separation~$\Delta$ of the
gamma-ray pulsations and the radio lag~$\delta$ between the gamma-ray and radio pulses. We selected
several radio-loud millisecond gamma-ray pulsars with period~$P$ in the range 2-6~ms and showing
double peak in their gamma-ray profiles. We attempted to constrain the geometry of their magnetosphere,
namely the magnetic axis and line of sight inclination angles for each of these systems. We applied
a force-free dipole magnetosphere from the stellar surface up to the striped wind region, well outside
the light cylinder, to fit the observed pulse profiles in gamma-rays, consistently with its phase
alignment with the radio profile. In deciding whether a fitted curve is reasonable or not, we employed
a least-square method to compare the observed gamma-ray intensity with that found from our model,
emphasizing the amplitude of the gamma-ray peaks, their separation and the phase lag between radio
and gamma-ray peaks. We obtained the best fits and reasonable parameters in agreement with observations
for ten millisecond pulsars. Eventually, we constrained the geometry of each pulsar described
by the magnetic inclination~$\alpha$ and the light of sight inclination~$\zeta$. We found that
both angles are larger than approximately~$45^{\rm o}$.

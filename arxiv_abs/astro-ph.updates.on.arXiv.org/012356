NASA's Spitzer Infrared Spectrometer (IRS) acquired mid-infrared (5-37 microns) disc-averaged
spectra of Uranus very near to its equinox in December 2007. A mean spectrum was constructed from
observations of multiple central meridian longitudes, spaced equally around the planet, which
has provided the opportunity for the most comprehensive globally-averaged characterisation
of Uranus' temperature and composition ever obtained (Orton et al., 2014 a [arXiv:1407.2120],
b [arXiv:1407.2118]). In this work we analyse the disc-averaged spectra at four separate central
meridian longitudes to reveal significant longitudinal variability in thermal emission occurring
in Uranus' stratosphere during the 2007 equinox. We detect a variability of up to 15% at wavelengths
sensitive to stratospheric methane, ethane and acetylene at the ~0.1-mbar level. The tropospheric
hydrogen-helium continuum and deuterated methane absorption exhibit a negligible variation
(less than 2%), constraining the phenomenon to the stratosphere. Building on the forward-modelling
analysis of the global average study, we present full optimal estimation inversions (using the
NEMESIS retrieval algorithm, Irwin et al., 2008 [10.1016/j.jqsrt.2007.11.006]) of the Uranus-2007
spectra at each longitude to distinguish between thermal and compositional variability. We found
that the variations can be explained by a temperature change of less than 3 K in the stratosphere.
Near-infrared observations from Keck II NIRC2 in December 2007 (Sromovsky et al., 2009 [arXiv:1503.01957],
de Pater et al., 2011 [10.1016/j.icarus.2011.06.022]), and mid-infrared observations from VLT/VISIR
in 2009 (Roman et al., 2020 [arXiv:1911.12830]), help to localise the potential sources to either
large scale uplift or stratospheric wave phenomena.

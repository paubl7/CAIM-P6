Observations of protoplanetary disks around very low mass stars and Brown Dwarfs remain challenging
and little is known about the properties of these disks. The disk around CIDA 1 ($\sim$0.1-0.2 $M_\odot$)
is one of the very few known disks that hosts a large cavity (20 au radius in size) around a very low mass
star. We present new ALMA observations at Band 7 (0.9 mm) and Band 4 (2.1 mm) of CIDA 1 with a resolution
of $\sim 0.05''\times 0.034''$. These new ALMA observations reveal a very bright and unresolved
inner disk, a shallow spectral index of the dust emission ($\sim2$), and a complex morphology of
a ring located at 20 au. We also present X-Shooter (VLT) observations that confirm a high value of
the accretion rate of CIDA 1 of $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$ = 1.4 $~\times~10^{-8} M_\odot$/yr. This high
value of $\dot{M}_{\rm acc}$, the observed inner disk, and the large cavity of 20 au exclude models
of photo-evaporation as potential origin of the observed cavity. When comparing these observations
with models that combine planet-disk interaction, dust evolution, and radiative transfer, we
exclude planets more massive than 0.5 $M_{\rm{Jup}}$ as the potential origin of the large cavity
because otherwise it is difficult to maintain a long-lived and bright inner disk. Even in this planet
mass regime, an additional physical process may be needed to stop the particles to migrate inwards
and maintain a bright inner disk at million-years timescales. Such mechanisms include a trap formed
by a very close-in extra planet or the inner edge of a dead zone. The low spectral index of the disk around
CIDA 1 is difficult to explain and challenges our current dust evolution models, in particular processes
like fragmentation, growth, and diffusion of particles inside pressure bumps.

Context. To investigate the source of a type III radio burst storm during encounter 2 of NASA's Parker
Solar Probe (PSP) mission. Aims. It was observed that in encounter 2 of NASA's Parker Solar Probe
mission there was a large amount of radio activity, and in particular a noise storm of frequent, small
type III bursts from 31st March to 6th April 2019. Our aim is to investigate the source of these small
and frequent bursts. Methods. In order to do this, we analysed data from the Hinode EUV Imaging Spectrometer
(EIS), PSP FIELDS, and the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) Atmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA).
We studied the behaviour of active region 12737, whose emergence and evolution coincides with the
timing of the radio noise storm and determined the possible origins of the electron beams within
the active region. To do this, we probe the dynamics, Doppler velocity, non-thermal velocity, FIP
bias, densities, and carry out magnetic modelling. Results. We demonstrate that although the active
region on the disk produces no significant flares, its evolution indicates it is a source of the electron
beams causing the radio storm. They most likely originate from the area at the edge of the active region
that shows strong blue-shifted plasma. We demonstrate that as the active region grows and expands,
the area of the blue-shifted region at the edge increases, which is also consistent with the increasing
area where large-scale or expanding magnetic field lines from our modelling are anchored. This
expansion is most significant between 1 and 4 April 2019, coinciding with the onset of the type III
storm and the decrease of the individual burst's peak frequency, indicating the height at which
the peak radiation is emitted increases as the active region evolves.

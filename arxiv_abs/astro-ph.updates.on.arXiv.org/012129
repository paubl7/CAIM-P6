Self-gravitating discs are believed to play an important role in astrophysics in particular regarding
the star and planet formation process. In this context, discs subject to an idealized cooling process,
characterized by a cooling timescale $\beta$ expressed in unit of orbital timescale, have been
extensively studied. We take advantage of the Riemann solver and the 3D Godunov scheme implemented
in the code Ramses to perform high resolution simulations, complementing previous studies that
have used smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) or 2D grid codes. We observe that the critical value
of $\beta$ for which the disc fragments is consistent with most previous results, and is not well
converged with resolution. By studying the probability density function of the fluctuations of
the column density ($\Sigma$-PDF), we argue that there is no strict separation between the fragmented
and the unfragmented regimes but rather a smooth transition with the probability of apparition
of fragments steadily diminishing as the cooling becames less effective. We find that the high column
density part of the $\Sigma$-PDF follows a simple power law whose slope turns out to be proportional
to $\beta$ and we propose an explanation based on the balance between cooling and heating through
gravitational stress. Our explanation suggests that a more efficient cooling requires more heating
implying a larger fraction of dense material which, in the absence of characteristic scales, results
in a shallower scale-free power law. We propose that the gravitational cascade proceeds in two steps,
first the formation of a dense filamentary spiral pattern through a sequence of quasi-static equilibrium
triggered by the viscous transport of angular momentum, and second the collapse alongside these
filaments that eventually results in the formation of bounded fragments.

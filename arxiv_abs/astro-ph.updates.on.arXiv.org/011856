We study the metallicity dependence of the H/H2 and C+/C/CO distributions in a self-regulated interstellar
medium (ISM) across a broad range of metallicities (0.1 < $Z/Z_\odot$ < 3). To this end, we conduct
high-resolution (particle mass of 1 $M_\odot$) hydrodynamical simulations coupled with a time-dependent
H2 chemistry network. The results are then post-processed with an accurate chemistry network to
model the associated C+/C/CO abundances, based on the time-dependent ("non-equilibrium") H2
abundances. We find that the time-averaged star formation rate and the ISM structure are insensitive
to metallicity. The column densities relevant for molecular shielding are correlated with the
volume densities in gravitationally unstable gas. As metallicity decreases, H2 progressively
deviates from steady state ("equilibrium") and shows shallow abundance profiles until they sharply
truncate at the photodissociation fronts. In contrast, the CO profile is sharp and controlled by
photodissociation as CO quickly reaches steady state. We construct effective one-dimensional
cloud models that successfully capture the time-averaged chemical distributions in simulations.
At low metallicities, the steady-state model significantly overestimates the abundance of H2
in the diffuse medium. The overestimated H2, however, has little impact on CO. Consequently, the
mass fraction of CO-dark H2 gas is significantly lower than what a fully steady-state model predicts.
The mass ratios of H2/C+ and H2/C both show a weaker dependence on Z than H2/CO, which potentially
indicates that C+ and C could be alternative tracers for H2 at low Z in terms of mass budget. The time-dependent
effect may explain the observed relationship between column densities of H2 and CO in Galactic clouds
without resorting to non-thermal chemical reactions. Our chemistry code for post-processing
is publicly available.

Aims. We study the 27-day variations of galactic cosmic rays (GCRs) based on neutron monitor (NM),
ACE/CRIS, STEREO and SOHO/EPHIN measurements, in solar minima 23/24 and 24/25 characterized by
the opposite polarities of solar magnetic cycle. Now there is an opportunity to reanalyze the polarity
dependence of the amplitudes of the recurrent GCR variations in 2007-2009 for negative A < 0 solar
magnetic polarity and to compare it with the clear periodic variations related to solar rotation
in 2017-2019 for positive A > 0. Methods. We use the Fourier analysis method to study the periodicity
in the GCR fluxes. Since the GCR recurrence is a consequence of solar rotation, we analyze not only
GCR fluxes, but also solar and heliospheric parameters examining the relationships between the
27-day GCR variations and heliospheric, as well as, solar wind parameters. Results. We find that
the polarity dependence of the amplitudes of the 27-day variations of the GCR intensity and anisotropy
for NMs data is kept for the last two solar minima: 23/24 (2007-2009) and 24/25 (2017-2019) with greater
amplitudes in positive A > 0 solar magnetic polarity. ACE/CRIS, SOHO/EPHIN and STEREO measurements
are not governed by this principle of greater amplitudes in positive A > 0 polarity. GCR recurrence
caused by the solar rotation for low energy (< 1GeV) cosmic rays is more sensitive to the enhanced
diffusion effects, resulting in the same level of the 27-day amplitudes for positive and negative
polarities. While high energy (> 1GeV) cosmic rays registered by NMs, are more sensitive to the large-scale
drift effect leading to the 22-year Hale cycle in the 27-day GCR variation, with the larger amplitudes
in the A > 0 polarity than in the A < 0.

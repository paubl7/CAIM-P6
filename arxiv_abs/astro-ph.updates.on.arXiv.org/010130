During inflation, vacuum quantum fluctuations are amplified and stretched to astrophysical distances.
They give rise to fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background (CMB) temperature and polarisation,
and to large-scale structures in our universe. They can also trigger the formation of primordial
black holes (PBHs). Such objects could provide the progenitors of the recently detected black-hole
mergers, and constitute part or all of the dark matter. Their observation would give invaluable
access to parts of the inflationary sector that are unconstrained by the CMB. Since PBHs require
large inhomogeneities to form, they are produced in scenarios where quantum fluctuations substantially
modify the dynamics of the universe. In this habilitation thesis, this "backreaction" effect is
investigated using the stochastic inflation formalism, an effective theory for the long-wavelengths
of quantum fields during inflation, which can be described in a classical but stochastic way once
the small wavelengths have been integrated out. It describes an inflating background that gets
randomly corrected by the vacuum quantum fluctuations as they get stretched to large distances.
After a brief review of the stochastic inflation formalism, we explain how it can be combined with
standard techniques of cosmological perturbation theory (the $\delta N$ formalism) to provide
the full probability density function of curvature perturbations in the presence of non-perturbative
quantum diffusion. These results are then applied to PBHs, where we show that quantum diffusion
can change the expected abundance by several orders of magnitude. Finally, since inflationary
models giving rise to cosmologically relevant PBHs often feature violations of slow roll, the stochastic-$\delta
N$ formalism is generalised to non slow-roll dynamics. We conclude by highlighting several research
directions that remain to be explored.

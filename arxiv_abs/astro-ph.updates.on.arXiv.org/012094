We study the decay of cosmic string loops in the Abelian-Higgs model. We confirm earlier results
that loops formed by intersections of infinite strings formed from random-field initial conditions
disappear quickly, with lifetime proportional to their initial rest-frame length $\ell_\text{init}$.
We study a population with $\ell_\text{init}$ up to $6000$ inverse mass units, and measure the proportionality
constant to be $0.14\pm0.04$, independently of the initial lengths. We propose a new method to construct
oscillating non-self intersecting loops from initially stationary strings, and show that by contrast
these loops have lifetimes scaling approximately as $\ell_\text{init}^2$, in line with previous
works on artificially created string configurations. We show that the oscillating strings have
mean-square velocity $\bar{v}^2 \simeq 0.500 \pm 0.004$, consistent with the Nambu-Goto value
of $1/2$, while the network loops have $\bar{v}^2 \simeq 0.40 \pm 0.04$. We argue that whatever the
mechanism behind the network loop decay is, it is non-linear, can only be suppressed by careful tuning
of initial conditions, and is much stronger than gravitational radiation. An implication is that
one cannot use the Nambu-Goto model to derive robust constraints on the tension of field theory strings.
We advocate parametrising the uncertainty as the fraction $f_\text{NG}$ of Nambu-Goto-like loops
surviving to radiate gravitationally. None of the 31 large network loops created survived longer
than 0.25 of their initial length, so one can estimate that $f_\text{NG}<0.1$ at $95$% confidence
level. If the recently reported NANOgrav signal is due to cosmic strings, $f_\text{NG}$ must be
greater than $10^{-3}$ in order not to violate bounds from the Cosmic Microwave Background.

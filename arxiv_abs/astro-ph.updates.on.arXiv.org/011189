Weathering of silicate rocks at a planetary surface can draw down CO$_2$ from the atmosphere for
eventual burial and long-term storage in the planetary interior. This process is thought to provide
an essential negative feedback to the carbonate-silicate cycle (carbon cycle) to maintain clement
climates on Earth and potentially similar temperate exoplanets. We implement thermodynamics
to determine weathering rates as a function of surface lithology (rock type). These rates provide
upper limits that allow estimating the maximum rate of weathering in regulating climate. This modeling
shows that the weathering of mineral assemblages in a given rock, rather than individual minerals,
is crucial to determine weathering rates at planetary surfaces. By implementing a fluid-transport
controlled approach, we further mimic chemical kinetics and thermodynamics to determine weathering
rates for three types of rocks inspired by the lithologies of Earth's continental and oceanic crust,
and its upper mantle. We find that thermodynamic weathering rates of a continental crust-like lithology
are about one to two orders of magnitude lower than those of a lithology characteristic of the oceanic
crust. We show that when the CO$_2$ partial pressure decreases or surface temperature increases,
thermodynamics rather than kinetics exerts a strong control on weathering. The kinetically- and
thermodynamically-limited regimes of weathering depend on lithology, whereas, the supply-limited
weathering is independent of lithology. Our results imply that the temperature-sensitivity of
thermodynamically-limited silicate weathering may instigate a positive feedback to the carbon
cycle, in which the weathering rate decreases as the surface temperature increases.

We place empirical constraints on the yields from zero- and low-metallicity core collapse supernovae
(CCSNe) using abundances measured in very metal-poor (VMP; [Fe/H] $\leq$ $-2$) Damped Lyman Alpha
Absorbers (DLAs). For some abundance ratios, VMP DLAs constrain the metal yields of the first SNe
more reliably than VMP stars. We compile a large sample of high-S/N VMP DLAs from over 30 years of literature,
most with high resolution spectral measurements. We infer the median IMF-averaged CCSNe yield
from the median values from the DLA abundance ratios of C, N, O, Al, Si, S, and Fe (with respect to Fe
and O). Critically, we assume that the DLAs are metal-poor enough that they represent galaxies in
their earliest stages of evolution, when CCSNe are the only nucleosynthetic sources of the metals
we analyze. We compare five widely adopted zero- and low-metallicity theoretical yield sets to
the empirical yields derived in this work. We find that the theoretical yield sets agree with the
DLA yields for [Si/O], [Si/Fe], [S/O], and [S/Fe]. The theoretical models predict a large range
of N yields, and only one of the models, Heger & Woosley 2010 (hereafter HW10), reproduced the DLA
value of [N/Fe] and [N/O], and only one other model, Limongi & Chieffi 2018 (hereafter LC18), reproduced
[N/O]. We briefly investigate the adoption of a SN explosion landscape (where certain initial stellar
masses collapse into black holes without contributing to nucleosynthesis) onto HW10 and find the
predictions are comparable to when there is no landscape. On the other hand, fixing explosion energy
to progenitor mass results in wide disagreements between the predictions and DLA abundances. We
also investigate the adoption of a simple, observationally motivated Initial Distribution of
Rotational Velocities (IDROV) for LC18, which has rotation velocity as a free parameter, and find
a slight improvement.

We report the results of AstroSat observations of GRS 1915$+$105 obtained using 100 ks guaranteed-time
(GT) during the soft state. The Color-Color Diagram (CCD) indicates a variability class of $\delta$
with the detection of High Frequency QPO (HFQPO) in the power density spectra (PDS). The HFQPO is
seen to vary in the frequency range of $67.96 - 70.62$ Hz with percentage rms $\sim 0.83 - 1.90$ % and
significance varying from $1.63 - 7.75$. The energy dependent power spectra show that the HFQPO
features are dominant only in $6 - 25$ keV energy band. The broadband energy spectra ($0.7 - 50$ keV)
of SXT (Soft X-ray Telescope) and LAXPC (Large Area X-ray Proportional Counter) modelled with nthComp
and powerlaw imply that the source has an extended corona in addition to a compact 'Comptonizing
corona' that produces high energy emission and exhibits HFQPOs. The broadband spectral modelling
indicates that the source spectra are well described by thermal Comptonization with electron temperature
(kT$_{\rm e}$) of $2.07 - 2.43$ keV and photon-index ($\Gamma_{\rm nth}$) between $1.73-2.45$
with an additional powerlaw component of photon-index ($\Gamma_{\rm PL}$) between $2.94 - 3.28$.
The norm of nthComp component is high ($\sim 8$) during the presence of strong HFQPO and low ($\sim
3$) during the absence of HFQPO. Further, we model the energy spectra with the kerrbb model to estimate
the accretion rate, mass and spin of the source. Our findings indicate that the source accretes at
super-Eddington rate of $1.17-1.31~ \dot{M}_{\rm Edd}$. Moreover, we find the mass and spin of
the source as $12.44 - 13.09~M_{\odot}$ and $0.990-0.997$ with $90\%$ confidence suggesting that
GRS 1915$+$105 is a maximally rotating stellar mass X-ray binary black hole source.

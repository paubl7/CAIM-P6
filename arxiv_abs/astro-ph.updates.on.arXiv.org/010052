During the last decade, the observations of diffuse radio synchrotron emission towards galaxy
clusters have revealed the presence of cosmic ray (CR) electrons and magnetic fields on Mpc scales.
However, their origin remains poorly understood to date, and several models have been discussed
in the literature. CR protons are also expected to accumulate during the formation of clusters and
should contribute to the production of these high energy electrons. In order to understand the physics
of CR in clusters, the combining of observations at various wavelengths is particularly relevant.
The exploitation of such data requires to use a self-consistent approach including both the thermal
and the non-thermal components, capable of predicting observables associated to the multi-wavelength
probes at play, in particular in the radio, millimeter, X-ray and gamma-ray bands. We develop and
describe such a self-consistent modeling framework named MINOT (Modeling of the Intra-cluster
medium (Non-)thermal content and Observables prediction Tools) and make this tool available to
the community. The multi-wavelength observables are computed given the relevant physical process,
according to the cluster location, and given the sampling defined by the user. We describe the way
MINOT is implemented and how to use it. We also discuss the different assumptions and approximations
that are involved, and provide various examples regarding the production of output products at
different wavelengths. As an illustration, we model the clusters A1795, A2142 and A2255 and compare
the MINOT predictions to literature data. MINOT can be used to model the cluster thermal and non-thermal
physical processes for a wide variety of datasets in the radio, millimeter, X-ray and gamma-ray
bands, as well as the neutrinos emission. [abridged]

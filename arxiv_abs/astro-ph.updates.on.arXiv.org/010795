Analysis of new precision radial velocity (RV) measurements from the Lick Automated Planet Finder
(APF) and Keck HIRES have yielded the discovery of three new exoplanet candidates orbiting two nearby
K dwarfs not previously reported to have companions (HD 190007 & HD 216520). We also report new velocities
from both the APF and the Planet Finder Spectrograph (PFS) for the previously reported planet host
stars GJ 686 and HD 180617 and update the corresponding exoplanet orbital models. Of the newly discovered
planets, HD 190007 b has a period of 11.72 days, an RV semi-amplitude of K = 5.64$\pm$0.55 m s$^{-1}$,
a minimum mass of 16.46$\pm$1.66 $\rm M_{\oplus}$, and orbits the slightly metal-rich, active
K4 dwarf star HD 190007 (d = 12.7 pc). HD 216520 b has an orbital period of 35.45 days, an RV semi-amplitude
of K = 2.28$\pm$0.20 m s$^{-1}$, and a minimum mass of 10.26$\pm$0.99 $\rm M_{\oplus}$, while HD
216520 c has an orbital period of P = 154.43 days, an RV semi-amplitude of K = 1.29$\pm0.22$ m s$^{-1}$,
and a minimum mass of 9.44$\pm$1.63 $\rm M_{\oplus}$. Both of these planets orbit the slightly metal-poor,
inactive K0 dwarf star HD 216520 (d = 19.6 pc). We find that our updated best fit models for HD 180617
b and GJ 686 b are in good agreement with the previously published results. For HD 180617 b we obtain
an orbital period of 105.91 days, an RV semi-amplitude of K = 2.696$\pm$0.22 m s$^{-1}$, and a minimum
mass of 2.214$\pm$1.05 $\rm M_{\oplus}$. For GJ 686 b we find the orbital period to be 15.53 days,
the RV semi-amplitude to be K = 3.00$\pm$0.18 m s$^{-1}$, and the minimum mass to be 6.624$\pm$0.432
$\rm M_{\oplus}$. Using an injection-recovery exercise, we find that HD 190007 b and HD 216520 b
are unlikely to have additional planets with masses and orbital periods within a factor of two, in
marked contrast to $\sim$85\% of planets in this mass and period range found with Kepler.

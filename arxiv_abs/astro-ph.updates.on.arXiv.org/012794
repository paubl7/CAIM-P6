The Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) collaboration, an Earth-size sub-millimetre radio interferometer,
recently captured the first images of the central supermassive black hole in M87. These images were
interpreted as gravitationally-lensed synchrotron emission from hot plasma orbiting around
the black hole. In the accretion flows around low-luminosity active galactic nuclei such as M87,
electrons and ions are not in thermal equilibrium. Therefore, the electron temperature, which
is important for the thermal synchrotron radiation at EHT frequencies of 230 GHz, is not independently
determined. In this work, we investigate the commonly used parameterised ion-to-electron temperature
ratio prescription, the so-called R-$\beta$ model, considering images at 230 GHz by comparing
with electron-heating prescriptions obtained from general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamical
(GRMHD) simulations of magnetised accretion flows in a Magnetically Arrested Disc (MAD) regime
with different recipes for the electron thermodynamics. When comparing images at 230 GHz, we find
a very good match between images produced with the R-$\beta$ prescription and those produced with
the turbulent- and magnetic reconnection- heating prescriptions. Indeed, this match is on average
even better than that obtained when comparing the set of images built with the R-$\beta$ prescription
with either a randomly chosen image or with a time-averaged one. From this comparative study of different
physical aspects, which include the image, visibilities, broadband spectra, and light curves,
we conclude that, within the context of images at 230 GHz relative to MAD accretion flows around supermassive
black holes, the commonly-used and simple R-$\beta$ model is able to reproduce well the various
and more complex electron-heating prescriptions considered here.

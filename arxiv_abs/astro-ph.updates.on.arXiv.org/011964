A growing body of evidence suggests that the solar wind is powered to a large extent by an Alfv\'en-wave
(AW) energy flux. AWs energize the solar wind via two mechanisms: heating and work. We use high-resolution
direct numerical simulations of reflection-driven AW turbulence (RDAWT) in a fast-solar-wind
stream emanating from a coronal hole to investigate both mechanisms. In particular, we compute
the fraction of the AW power at the coronal base ($P_{\rm AWb}$) that is transferred to solar-wind
particles via heating between the coronal base and heliocentric distance $r$, which we denote $\chi_{\rm
H}(r)$, and the fraction that is transferred via work, which we denote $\chi_{\rm W}(r)$. We find
that $\chi_{\rm W}(r_{\rm A})$ ranges from 0.15 to 0.3, where $r_{\rm A}$ is the Alfv\'en critical
point. This value is small compared to~one because the Alfv\'en speed $v_{\rm A} $ exceeds the outflow
velocity $U$ at $r<r_{\rm A}$, so the AWs race through the plasma without doing much work. At $r>r_{\rm
A}$, where $v_{\rm A} < U$, the AWs are in an approximate sense "stuck to the plasma", which helps them
do pressure work as the plasma expands. However, much of the AW power has dissipated by the time the
AWs reach $r=r_{\rm A}$, so the total rate at which AWs do work on the plasma at $r>r_{\rm A}$ is a modest
fraction of $P_{\rm AWb}$. We find that heating is more effective than work at $r<r_{\rm A}$, with
$\chi_{\rm H}(r_{\rm A})$ ranging from 0.5 to 0.7. The reason that $\chi_{\rm H} \geq 0.5$ in our
simulations is that an appreciable fraction of the local AW power dissipates within each Alfv\'en-speed
scale height in RDAWT, and there are a few Alfv\'en-speed scale heights between the coronal base
and $r_{\rm A}$.

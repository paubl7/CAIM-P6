[Purpose:] We infer the posterior probability distribution functions (PDFs) and correlations
of nine parameters characterizing the EOS of dense neutron-rich matter encapsulating a first-order
hadron-quark phase transition from the radius data of canonical NSs reported by LIGO/VIRGO, NICER
and Chandra Collaborations. We also infer the quark matter (QM) mass fraction and its radius in a
1.4 M$_{\odot}$ NS and predict their values in more massive NSs. [Method:] Meta-modelings are used
to generate both hadronic and QM EOSs in the Markov-Chain Monte Carlo sampling process within the
Bayesian statistical framework. An explicitly isospin-dependent parametric EOS for the $npe\mu$
matter in NSs at $\beta$ equilibrium is connected through the Maxwell construction to the QM EOS
described by the constant speed of sound (CSS) model of Alford, Han and Prakash. [Results:] (1) The
most probable values of the hadron-quark transition density $\rho_t/\rho_0$ and the relative
energy density jump there $\De\ep/\ep_t$ are $\rho_t/\rho_0=1.6^{+1.2}_{-0.4}$ and $\De\ep/\ep_t=0.4^{+0.20}_{-0.15}$
at 68\% confidence level, respectively. The corresponding probability distribution of QM fraction
in a 1.4 M$_{\odot}$ NS peaks around 0.9 in a 10 km sphere. Strongly correlated to the PDFs of $\rho_t$
and $\De\ep/\ep_t$, the PDF of the QM speed of sound squared $\cQMsq/c^2$ peaks at $0.95^{+0.05}_{-0.35}$,
and the total probability of being less than 1/3 is very small. (2) The correlations between PDFs
of hadronic and QM EOS parameters are very weak. [Conclusions:] The available astrophysical data
considered together with all known EOS constraints from theories and terrestrial nuclear experiments
prefer the formation of a large volume of QM even in canonical NSs.

Art and science are different ways of exploring the world, but together they have the potential to
be thought-provoking, facilitate a science-society dialogue, raise public awareness of science,
and develop an understanding of art. For several years, we have been teaching an astro-animation
class at the Maryland Institute College of Art as a collaboration between students and NASA scientists.
Working in small groups, the students create short animations based on the research of the scientists
who are going to follow the projects as mentors. By creating these animations, students bring the
power of their imagination to see the research of the scientists through a different lens. Astro-animation
is an undergraduate-level course jointly taught by an astrophysicist and an animator. In this paper
we present the motivation behind the class, describe the details of how it is carried out, and discuss
the interactions between artists and scientists. We describe how such a program offers an effective
way for art students, not only to learn about science but to have a glimpse of "science in action".
The students have the opportunity to become involved in the process of science as artists, as observers
first and potentially through their own art research. Every year, one or more internships at NASA
Goddard Space Flight Center have been available for our students in the summer. Two students describe
their experiences undertaking these internships and how science affects their creation of animations
for this program and in general. We also explain the genesis of our astro-animation program, how
it is taught in our animation department, and we present the highlights of an investigation of the
effectiveness of this program we carried out with the support of an NEA research grant. In conclusion
we discuss how the program may grow in new directions, such as contributing to informal STE(A)M learning.

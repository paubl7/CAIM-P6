Surface brightness-colour relations (SBCRs) are widely used for estimating angular diameters
and deriving stellar properties. They are critical to derive extragalactic distances of early-type
and late-type eclipsing binaries or, potentially, for extracting planetary parameters of late-type
stars hosting planets. Various SBCRs have been implemented so far, but strong discrepancies in
terms of precision and accuracy still exist in the literature. We aim at developing a precise SBCR
for B- and A- early-type stars using selection criteria based on stellar characteristics and combined
with homogeneous interferometric angular diameter measurements. We also improve SBCRs for late-type
stars, in particular in the Gaia photometric band. We observed 18 early-type stars with the VEGA
instrument, installed on the CHARA array. We then apply additional criteria on the photometric
measurements, together with stellar characteristics diagnostics in order to build the SBCRs.
We calibrate a SBCR for sub-giant and dwarf early-type stars. The RMS of the relation is $\sigma_{F_{V_{0}}}
= 0.0051\,$mag, leading to an average precision of 2.3% on the estimation of angular diameters,
with 3.1% for $V-K < -0.2\,$mag and 1.8% for $V-K > -0.2\,$mag. We found that the conversion between
Johnson-$K$ and 2MASS-$K_s$ photometries is a key issue for early-type stars. Following this result,
we have revisited our previous SBCRs for late-type stars by calibrating them with either converted
Johnson-$K$ or 2MASS-$K_s$ photometries. We also improve the calibration of these SBCRs based
on the Gaia photometry. The expected precision on the angular diameter using our SBCRs for late-type
stars ranges from 1.0% to 2.7%. By reaching a precision of 2.3% on the estimation of angular diameters
for early-type stars, a significant progress is done to determine extragalactic distances using
early-type eclipsing binaries.

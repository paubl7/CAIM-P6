Stellar mergers are a brief-lived but common phase in the evolution of binary star systems. Among
the many astrophysical implications of these events include the creation of atypical stars (e.g.
magnetic stars, blue stragglers, rapid rotators), interpretation of stellar populations, and
formation channels of LIGO-detected compact object mergers. Although stellar mergers are thus
commonly invoked phenomena, observations of these events and details of their evolution remain
elusive. While a handful of stellar mergers have been directly observed in recent years, the central
remnants of these events remain shrouded by an opaque shell of dust and molecules, making it impossible
to observe their final state (e.g. as a single merged star or a tighter surviving binary). Here we
report observations of an unusual, ring-shaped ultraviolet nebula and the star at its center, TYC
2597-735-1. The nebula shows two opposing fronts, suggesting a bipolar outflow from TYC 2597-735-1.
TYC 2597-735-1's spectrum and proximity above the Galactic plane suggest it is an old star, yet it
shows abnormally low surface gravity and a detectable long-term luminosity decay, uncharacteristic
for its evolutionary stage. TYC 2597-735-1 also exhibits H-alpha emission, radial velocity variations,
enhanced ultraviolet radiation, and excess infrared emission, common signposts of dusty circumstellar
disks, stellar activity, and accretion. The combined observations, paired with stellar evolution
models, suggests TYC 2597-735-1 merged with a lower-mass companion several thousand years ago.
TYC 2597-735-1 provides a look at an unobstructed stellar merger found at an evolutionary stage
between its dynamic onset and the theorized final equilibrium state, directly inferring how two
stars merge into a single star.

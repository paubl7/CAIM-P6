Identifying the most likely sources for high-energy neutrino emission has been one of the main topics
in high-energy astrophysics ever since the first observation of high-energy neutrinos by the IceCube
Neutrino Observatory. Active galactic nuclei with relativistic jets, also known as blazars, have
been considered to be one of the main candidates because of their ability to accelerate particles
to high energies. We study the connection between radio emission and IceCube neutrino events using
data from the Owens Valley Radio Observatory (OVRO) and Mets\"ahovi Radio Observatory blazar monitoring
programs. We identify sources in our radio monitoring sample that are positionally consistent
with IceCube high-energy neutrino events. We estimate their mean flux density and variability
amplitudes around the neutrino arrival time, and compare these with values from random samples
to establish the significance of our results. We find radio source associations within our samples
with 15 high-energy neutrino events detected by IceCube. Nearly half of the associated sources
are not detected in the $\gamma$-ray energies, but their radio variability properties and Doppler
boosting factors are similar to the $\gamma$-ray detected objects in our sample, meaning that they
could still be potential neutrino emitters. We find that the number of strongly flaring objects
in our statistically complete OVRO samples is unlikely to be a random coincidence (at $2\sigma$
level). Based on our results, we conclude that although it is clear that not all neutrino events are
associated with strong radio flaring blazars, observations of large-amplitude radio flares in
a blazar at the same time as a neutrino event are unlikely to be a random coincidence.

The kinematic Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (kSZ) effect -- the Doppler boosting of cosmic microwave background
(CMB) photons scattering off free electrons with non-zero line-of-sight velocity -- is an excellent
probe of the distribution of baryons in the Universe. In this paper, we measure the kSZ effect due
to ionized gas traced by infrared-selected galaxies from the \emph{unWISE} catalog. We employ
the "projected-field" kSZ estimator, which does not require spectroscopic galaxy redshifts.
To suppress non-kSZ foreground signals associated with the galaxies (e.g., dust emission and thermal
SZ), this estimator requires cleaned CMB maps, which we obtain from \emph{Planck} and \emph{WMAP}
data. Using a new "asymmetric" estimator that combines different foreground-cleaned CMB maps
to maximize the signal-to-noise, we measure the kSZ$^2$-galaxy cross-power spectrum for three
subsamples of the \emph{unWISE} galaxy catalog, which peak at mean redshifts $z \approx$ 0.6, 1.1,
and 1.5, have average halo mass $\sim 1$-$5\times 10^{13}$ $h^{-1} M_{\odot}$, and in total contain
over 500 million galaxies. After marginalizing over CMB lensing contributions, we measure the
amplitude of the kSZ signal $A_{\rm kSZ^2} = 0.42 \pm 0.31(stat.) \pm 0.14(sys.)$, $5.02 \pm 1.01(stat.)
\pm 0.47(sys.)$, and $8.23 \pm 3.23(stat.) \pm 1.60(sys.)$, for the three subsamples, where $A_{\rm
kSZ^2} = 1$ corresponds to our fiducial model. The combined kSZ detection S/N $>$ 5. We discuss possible
explanations for the excess kSZ signal associated with the $z \approx 1.1$ sample, and show that
foreground contamination in the CMB maps is very unlikely to be the cause. Our measurements illustrate
clearly that no baryons are missing on large scales at low redshifts.

We address the two issues raised by Bayle, Vallisneri, Babak, and Petiteau (in their gr-qc document
arxiv.org/abs/2106.03976) about our matrix formulation of Time-Delay Interferometry (TDI)
(arxiv.org/abs/2105.02054) \cite{TDJ21}. In so doing we explain and quantify our concerns about
the results derived by Vallisneri, Bayle, Babak and Petiteau \cite{Vallisneri2020} by applying
their data processing technique (named TDI-$\infty$) to the two heterodyne measurements made
by a two-arm space-based GW interferometer. First we show that the solutions identified by the TDI-$\infty$
algorithm derived by Vallisneri, Bayle, Babak and Petiteau \cite{Vallisneri2020} {\underbar
{do}} depend on the boundary-conditions selected for the two-way Doppler data. We prove this by
adopting the (non-physical) boundary conditions used by Vallisneri {\it et al.} and deriving the
corresponding analytic expression for a laser-noise-canceling combination. We show it to be characterized
by a number of Doppler measurement terms that grows with the observation time and works for any time-dependent
time delays. We then prove that, for a constant-arm-length interferometer whose two-way light
times are equal to twice and three-times the sampling time, the solutions identified by TDI-$\infty$
are linear combinations of the TDI variable $X$. In the second part of this document we address the
concern expressed by Bayle {\it et al.} regarding our matrix formulation of TDI when the two-way
light-times are constant but not equal to integer multiples of the sampling time. We mathematically
prove the homomorphism between the delay operators and their matrix representation \cite{TDJ21}
holds in general. By sequentially applying two order-$m$ Fractional-Delay (FD) Lagrange filters
of delays $l_1$, $l_2$ we find its result to be equal to applying an order-$m$ FD Lagrange filter of
delay $l_1 + l_2$.

The Kepler and TESS missions delivered high-precision, long-duration photometric time series
for hundreds of main-sequence stars with gravito-inertial (g) pulsation modes. This high precision
allows us to evaluate increasingly detailed theoretical stellar models. Recent theoretical work
extended the traditional approximation of rotation (TAR), a framework to evaluate the effect of
the Coriolis acceleration on g-modes, to include the effects of the centrifugal acceleration in
the approximation of slightly deformed stars, which so far had mostly been neglected in asteroseismology.
This extension of the TAR was conceived by rederiving the TAR in a centrifugally deformed, spheroidal
coordinate system. We explore the effect of the centrifugal acceleration on g modes and assess its
detectability in space-based photometry. We implement the new framework to calculate the centrifugal
deformation of precomputed 1D spherical stellar structure models and compute the corresponding
g-mode frequencies, assuming uniform rotation. The framework is evaluated for a grid of stellar
structure models covering a relevant parameter space for observed g-mode pulsators. The centrifugal
acceleration modifies the effect of the Coriolis acceleration on g modes, narrowing the equatorial
band in which they are trapped. Furthermore, the centrifugal acceleration causes the pulsation
periods and period spacings of the most common g modes (prograde dipole modes and r modes) to increase
with values similar to the observational uncertainties in Kepler and TESS data. The effect of the
centrifugal acceleration on g~modes is formally detectable in modern space photometry. Implementation
of the new theoretical framework in stellar structure and pulsation codes will allow for more precise
asteroseismic modelling of centrifugally deformed stars, to assess its effect on mode excitation,
-trapping and -damping.

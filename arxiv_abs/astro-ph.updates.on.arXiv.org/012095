Classical T Tauri stars are young low-mass systems still accreting material from their disks. These
systems are dynamic on timescales of hours to years. The observed variability can help us infer the
physical processes that occur in the circumstellar environment. We aim at understanding the dynamics
of the magnetic interaction between the star and the inner accretion disk in young stellar objects.
We present the case of the young stellar system V2129 Oph, which is a well-known T Tauri star. We performed
a time series analysis of this star using high-resolution spectroscopic data at optical and infrared
wavelengths from CFHT/ESPaDOnS, ESO/HARPS and CFHT/SPIRou. The new data sets allowed us to characterize
the accretion-ejection structure in this system and to investigate its evolution over a timescale
of a decade via comparisons to previous observational data. We measure radial velocity variations
and recover a stellar rotation period of 6.53d. However, we do not recover the stellar rotation period
in the variability of various circumstellar lines, such as H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ in the optical
or HeI 1083nm and Pa$\beta$ in the infrared. Instead, we show that the optical and infrared line profile
variations are consistent with a magnetospheric accretion scenario that shows variability with
a period of about 6.0d, shorter than the stellar rotation period. Additionally, we find a period
of 8.5d in H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, probably due to a structure located beyond the corotation
radius, at a distance of 0.09au. We investigate whether this could be accounted for by a wind component,
twisted or multiple accretion funnel flows, or an external disturbance in the inner disk. We conclude
that the dynamics of the accretion-ejection process can vary significantly on a timescale of just
a few years, presumably reflecting the evolving magnetic field topology at the stellar surface.

The Mg I 12.32 and 12.22 $\mu$m lines are a pair of emission lines that present a great advantage for
accurate solar magnetic field measurement. They potentially contribute to the diagnosis of solar
atmospheric parameters through their high magnetic sensitivity. The goal of this study is to understand
the radiation transfer process of these lines in detail and explore the ability of magnetic field
diagnosis in the infrared. We calculated the Stokes profiles and response functions of the two Mg
I 12 $\mu$m lines based on one-dimensional solar atmospheric models using the Rybicki-Hummer (RH)
radiative transfer code. The integration of these profiles with respect to the wavelength was used
to generate calibration curves related to the longitudinal and transverse fields. The traditional
single-wavelength calibration curve based on the weak-field approximation was also tested to
determine if it is suitable for the infrared. The 12.32 $\mu$m line is more suitable for a magnetic
field diagnosis because its relative emission intensity and polarization signal are stronger
than that of the 12.22 $\mu$m line. The result from the response functions illustrates that the derived
magnetic field and velocity with 12.32 $\mu$m line mainly originate from the height of 450 km, while
that for the temperature is about 490 km. The calibration curves obtained by the wavelength-integrated
method show a nonlinear distribution. For the Mg I 12.32 $\mu$m line, the longitudinal (transverse)
field can be effectively inferred from Stokes V/I (Q/I and U/I) in the linear range below $\sim 600$
G ($\sim 3000$ G) in quiet regions and below $\sim 400$ G ($\sim 1200$ G) in penumbrae. Within the given
linear range, the method is a supplement to the magnetic field calibration when the Zeeman components
are incompletely split.

The Maunder Minimum (1645-1715) is currently considered the only grand minimum within telescopic
sunspot observations since 1610. During this epoch, the Sun was extremely quiet and unusually free
from sunspots. However, despite reduced frequency, candidate aurorae were reported in the mid-European
sector during this period and have been associated with occurrences of interplanetary coronal
mass ejections (ICMEs), whereas some of them have been identified as misinterpretations. Here,
we have analysed reports of candidate aurorae on 1 June 1680 with simultaneous observations in mid-Europe,
and compared their descriptions with visual accounts of early modern aurorae. Most contemporary
sunspot drawings from 22, 24, and 27 May 1680 have shown that this apparent sunspot may have been a
source of ICMEs, which caused the reported candidate aurorae. On the other hand, its intensity estimate
shows that the magnetic storm during this candidate aurora was probably within the capability of
the storms derived from the corotating interaction region (CIR). Therefore, we accommodate both
ICMEs and CIRs as their possible origin. This interpretation is probably applicable to the candidate
aurorae in the often-cited Hungarian catalogue, on the basis of the reconstructed margin of their
equatorward auroral boundary. Moreover, this catalogue itself has clarified that the considerable
candidates during the MM were probably misinterpretations. Therefore, frequency of the auroral
visibility in Hungary was probably lower than previously considered and agree more with the generally
slow solar wind in the existing reconstructions, whereas sporadic occurrences of sunspots and
coronal holes still caused occasional geomagnetic storms.

F type stars are characterised by several physical processes such as different pulsation mechanisms,
rotation, convection, diffusion, and magnetic fields. The rapidly rotating delta Scuti star beta
Cas can be considered as a benchmark star to study the interaction of several of these effects. We
investigate the pulsational and magnetic field properties of beta Cas. We also determine the star's
apparent fundamental parameters and chemical abundances. Based on photometric time series obtained
from three different space missions (BRITE-Constellation, SMEI, and TESS), we conduct a frequency
analysis and investigate the stability of the pulsation amplitudes over four years of observations.
We investigate the presence of a magnetic field and its properties using spectropolarimetric observations
taken with the Narval instrument by applying the Least Square Deconvolution and Zeeman Doppler
Imaging techniques. beta Cas shows only three independent p-mode frequencies down to the few ppm-level;
its highest amplitude frequency is suggested to be a $n=3$, $\ell = 2$, $m=0$ mode. Its magnetic field
structure is quite complex and almost certainly of a dynamo origin. beta Cas' atmosphere is slightly
deficient in iron peak elements and slightly overabundant in C, O, and heavier elements. Atypically
for delta Scuti stars, we can only detect three pulsation modes down to exceptionally low noise levels
for beta Cas. The star is also one of very few delta Scuti pulsators known to date to show a measurable
magnetic field, and the first delta Scuti star with a dynamo magnetic field. These characteristics
make beta Cas an interesting target for future studies of dynamo processes in the thin convective
envelopes of F-type stars, of the transition region between fossil and dynamo fields, and the interaction
between pulsations and magnetic field.

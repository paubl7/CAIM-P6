The degree to which the formation and evolution of clouds and filaments in the interstellar medium
is regulated by magnetic fields remains an open question. Yet the fundamental properties of the
fields (strength and 3D morphology) are not readily observable. We investigate the potential for
recovering magnetic field information from dust polarization, the Zeeman effect, and the Faraday
rotation measure ($RM$) in a SILCC-Zoom magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) filament simulation. The object
is analyzed at the onset of star formation, and it is characterized by a line-mass of about M/L $\sim
63\ M_{\odot}\ pc^{-1}$ out to a radius of $1\,$pc and a kinked 3D magnetic field morphology. We generate
synthetic observations via POLARIS radiative transfer (RT) post-processing, and compare with
an analytical model of helical or kinked field morphology to help interpreting the inferred observational
signatures. We show that the tracer signals originate close to the filament spine. We find regions
along the filament where the angular-dependency with the line-of-sight (LOS) is the dominant factor
and dust polarization may trace the underlying kinked magnetic field morphology. We also find that
reversals in the recovered magnetic field direction are not unambiguously associated to any particular
morphology. Other physical parameters, such as density or temperature, are relevant and sometimes
dominant compared to the magnetic field structure in modulating the observed signal. We demonstrate
that the Zeeman effect and the $RM$ recover the line-of-sight magnetic field strength to within
a factor 2.1 - 3.4. We conclude that the magnetic field morphology may not be unambiguously determined
in low-mass systems by observations of dust polarization, Zeeman effect, or $RM$, whereas the field
strengths can be reliably recovered.

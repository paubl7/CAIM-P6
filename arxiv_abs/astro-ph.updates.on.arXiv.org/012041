In this work, we use the {\sc astraeus} (seminumerical rAdiative tranSfer coupling of galaxy formaTion
and Reionization in N-body dArk mattEr simUlationS) framework which couples galaxy formation
and reionization in the first billion years. Exploring a number of models for reionization feedback
and the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from the galactic environment ($f_\mathrm{esc}$),
we quantify how the contribution of star-forming galaxies {(with halo masses $M_h>10^{8.2}$M$_\odot$)}
to reionization depends on the radiative feedback model, $f_\mathrm{esc}$, and the environmental
over-density. Our key findings are: (i) for constant $f_\mathrm{esc}$ models, intermediate-mass
galaxies (with halo masses of $M_h\simeq10^{9-11}$M$_\odot$ and absolute UV magnitudes of $M_{UV}
\sim -15$ to $-20$) in intermediate-density regions drive reionization; (ii) scenarios where
$f_\mathrm{esc}$ increases with decreasing halo mass shift the galaxy population driving reionization
to lower-mass galaxies ($M_h\lesssim10^{9.5}$M$_\odot$) with lower luminosities ($M_{UV}
\gtrsim-16$) and over-densities; (iii) reionization imprints its topology on the ionizing emissivity
of low-mass galaxies ($M_h\lesssim10^{9}$M$_\odot$) through radiative feedback. Low-mass
galaxies experience a stronger suppression of star formation by radiative feedback and show lower
ionizing emissivities in over-dense regions; (iv) a change in $f_\mathrm{esc}$ with galaxy properties
has the largest impact on the sources of reionization and their detectability, with the radiative
feedback strength and environmental over-density playing a sub-dominant role; (v) JWST-surveys
(with a limiting magnitude of $M_{UV} = -16$) will be able to detect the galaxies providing $\sim
60-70\%$ ($\sim 10\%$) of reionization photons at $z=7$ for constant $f_\mathrm{esc}$ models
(scenarios where $f_\mathrm{esc}$ increases with decreasing halo mass).

Using the Hamilton Echelle Spectrograph at Lick Observatory, we have obtained precise radial velocities
(RVs) of a sample of 373 G- and K-giant stars over more than 12 years, leading to the discovery of several
single and multiple planetary systems. The RVs of the long-period (~53 years) spectroscopic binary
$\epsilon$ Cyg (HIP 102488) are found to exhibit additional regular variations with a much shorter
period (~291 days). We intend to improve the orbital solution of the $\epsilon$ Cyg system and attempt
to identify the cause of the nearly periodic shorter period variations, which might be due to an additional
substellar companion. We used precise RV measurements of the K-giant star $\epsilon$ Cyg from Lick
Observatory, in combination with a large set of RVs collected more recently with the SONG telescope,
as well as archival data sets. Our Keplerian model to the RVs characterizes the orbit of the spectroscopic
binary to higher precision than achieved previously, resulting in a semi-major axis of $a = 15.8
\mathrm{AU}$, an eccentricity of $e = 0.93$, and a minimum mass of the secondary of $m \sin i = 0.265
M_\odot$. Additional short-period RV variations closely resemble the signal of a Jupiter-mass
planet orbiting the evolved primary component with a period of $291 \mathrm{d}$, but the period
and amplitude of the putative orbit change strongly over time. Furthermore, in our stability analysis
of the system, no stable orbits could be found in a large region around the best fit. Both of these findings
deem a planetary cause of the RV variations unlikely. Most of the investigated alternative scenarios,
such as an hierarchical triple or stellar spots, also fail to explain the observed variability convincingly.
Due to its very eccentric binary orbit, it seems possible, however, that $\epsilon$ Cyg could be
an extreme example of a heartbeat system.

The mechanism behind coronal heating still elude direct observation and modelling of viable theoretical
processes and the subsequent effect on coronal structures is one of the key tools available to assess
possible heating mechanisms. Wave-heating via phase-mixing of Magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) transverse
waves has been proposed as a possible way to convert magnetic energy into thermal energy but increasingly,
MHD models suggest this is not a sufficiently efficient mechanism. We model heating by phase-mixing
of transverse MHD waves in various configurations, to investigate whether certain circumstances
can enhance the heating sufficiently to sustain the million degree solar corona and to assess the
impact of the propagation and phase-mixing of transverse MHD waves on the structure of the boundary
shell of coronal loops. We use 3D MHD simulations of a pre-existing density enhancement in magnetised
medium and a boundary driver to trigger the propagation of transverse waves with the same power spectrum
as measured by the COmP. We consider different density structures, boundary conditions at the non-drive
footpoint, characteristics of the driver, and different forms of magnetic resistivity. We find
that different initial density structures affect the evolution of the boundary shell and some driver
configurations enhance the heating generated from the dissipation of the MHD waves. In particular,
drivers coherent on a larger spatial scale and higher dissipation coefficients generate significant
heating, although it is still insufficient. We conclude that while phase-mixing of transverse
MHD waves is unlikely to sustain the thermal structure of the corona, there are configurations that
allow for an enhanced efficiency of this mechanism. We provide possible signatures to identify
the presence of such configurations, such as the location of where the heating is deposited along
the coronal loop

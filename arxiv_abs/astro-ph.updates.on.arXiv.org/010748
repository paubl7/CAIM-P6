The magnetic breakout model, in which reconnection in the corona leads to destabilization of a filament
channel, explains numerous features of eruptive solar events, from small-scale jets to global-scale
coronal mass ejections (CMEs). The underlying multipolar topology, pre-eruption activities,
and sequence of magnetic reconnection onsets (first breakout, then flare) of many observed fast
CMEs/eruptive flares are fully consistent with the model. Recently, we have demonstrated that
most observed coronal-hole jets in fan/spine topologies also are induced by breakout reconnection
at the null point above a filament channel (with or without a filament). For these two types of eruptions
occurring in similar topologies, the key question is, why do some events generate jets while others
form CMEs? We focused on the initiation of eruptions in large bright points/small active regions
that were located in coronal holes and clearly exhibited null-point (fan/spine) topologies: such
configurations are referred to as pseudostreamers. We analyzed and compared SDO/AIA, SOHO/LASCO,
and RHESSI observations of three events. Our analysis of the events revealed two new observable
signatures of breakout reconnection prior to the explosive jet/CME outflows and flare onset: coronal
dimming and the opening-up of field lines above the breakout current sheet. Most key properties
were similar among the selected erupting structures, thereby eliminating region size, photospheric
field strength, magnetic configuration, and pre-eruptive evolution as discriminating factors
between jets and CMEs. We consider the factors that contribute to the different types of dynamic
behavior, and conclude that the main determining factor is the ratio of the magnetic free energy
associated with the filament channel compared to the energy associated with the overlying flux
inside and outside the pseudostreamer dome.

In a previous paper we introduced a new method for simulating collisional gravitational $N$-body
systems with linear time scaling on $N$, based on the Multi-Particle Collision (MPC) approach.
This allows us to simulate globular clusters with a realistic number of stellar particles in a matter
of hours on a typical workstation. We evolve star clusters containing up to $10^6$ stars to core collapse
and beyond. We quantify several aspects of core collapse over multiple realizations and different
parameters, while always resolving the cluster core with a realistic number of particles. We run
a large set of N-body simulations with our new code. The cluster mass function is a power-law with
no stellar evolution, allowing us to clearly measure the effects of the mass spectrum. Leading up
to core collapse, we find a power-law relation between the size of the core and the time left to core
collapse. Our simulations thus confirm the theoretical self-similar contraction picture but
with a dependence on the slope of the mass function. The time of core collapse has a non-monotonic
dependence on the slope, which is well fit by a parabola. This holds also for the depth of core collapse
and for the dynamical friction timescale of heavy particles. Cluster density profiles at core collapse
show a broken power law structure, suggesting that central cusps are a genuine feature of collapsed
cores. The core bounces back after collapse, and the inner density slope evolves to an asymptotic
value. The presence of an intermediate-mass black hole inhibits core collapse. We confirm and expand
on several predictions of star cluster evolution before, during, and after core collapse. Such
predictions were based on theoretical calculations or small-size direct $N$-body simulations.
Here we put them to the test on MPC simulations with a much larger number of particles, allowing us
to resolve the collapsing core.

Massive star evolution is still poorly understood, and observational tests are required to discriminate
between different implementations of physical phenomenon in stellar evolution codes. By confronting
stellar evolution models with observed properties of blue supergiants, such as pulsations, chemical
composition and position in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram, we aim at determining which of the
criterion used for convection (Schwarzschild or Ledoux) is best able to explain the observations.
We compute state-of-the-art stellar evolution models with either the Schwarzschild or the Ledoux
criterion for convection. Models are for $14$ to $35\,M_\odot$ at solar or Large Magellanic Cloud
metallicity. For each model, we compute the pulsation properties to know when radial modes are excited.
We then compare our results with the position of blue supergiants in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram,
with their surface chemical composition, and with their variability. Our results at Large Magellanic
Cloud metallicity shows only a slight preference for the Ledoux criterion over the Schwarzschild
one in reproducing at the same time the observed properties of blue supergiants, even if the Schwarzschild
criterion cannot be excluded at this metallicity. We check that changing the overshoot parameter
at solar metallicity does not improve the situation. We also check that our models are able to reproduce
the position of Galactic blue supergiant in the flux-weighted-gravity -- luminosity relation.
We confirm that overall, models computed with the Ledoux criterion are slightly better in matching
observations. Our results also support the idea that most Galactic $\alpha$ Cyg variables are blue
supergiants of the group 2, i.e. stars that have been through a previous red supergiant phase where
they have lost large amount of mass.

High resolution ALMA observations revealed a variety of rich substructures in numerous protoplanetary
disks. These structures consist of rings, gaps and asymmetric features. It is debated whether planets
can be accounted for these substructures in the dust continuum. Characterizing the origin of asymmetries
as seen in HD 163296 might lead to a better understanding of planet formation and the underlying physical
parameters of the system. We test the possibility of the formation of the crescent-shaped asymmetry
in the HD 163296 disk through planet-disk interaction. The goal is to obtain constraints on planet
masses and eccentricities and disk viscosities. Two dimensional, multi-fluid, hydrodynamical
simulations are performed with the FARGO3D code including three embedded planets. Dust is described
with the pressureless fluid approach and is distributed over eight size bins. Resulting grids are
post-processed with the radiative transfer code RADMC-3D and the CASA software to model synthetic
observations. We find that the crescent-shaped asymmetry can be qualitatively modeled with a Jupiter
mass planet at a radial distance of 48 au. Dust is trapped preferably in the trailing Lagrange point
L5 with a mass of 10 to 15 earth masses. Increased values of eccentricity of the innermost Jupiter
mass planet damages the stability of the crescent-shaped feature and does not reproduce the observed
radial proximity to the first prominent ring in the system. Generally, a low level of viscosity ($\alpha
\leq 2\cdot10^{-3}$) is necessary to allow the existence of such a feature. Including dust feedback
the leading point L4 can dominantly capture dust for dust grains with an initial Stokes number $\leq
3.6\cdot 10^{-2}$. The observational results suggest a negligible effect of dust feedback since
only one such feature has been detected so far.

High spectral resolution observations toward the low mass-loss rate C-rich, J-type AGB star Y CVn
have been carried out at 7.5, 13.1 and 14.0 um with SOFIA/EXES and IRTF/TEXES. Around 130 HCN and H13CN
lines of bands v2, 2v2, 2v2-v2, 3v2-2v2, 3v2-v2, and 4v2-2v2 have been identified involving lower
levels with energies up to ~3900 K. These lines have been complemented with the pure rotational lines
J=1-0 and 3-2 of the vibrational states up to 2v2 acquired with the IRAM 30 m telescope, and with the
continuum taken with ISO. We have analyzed the data with a ro-vibrational diagram and a code which
models the absorption and emission of the circumstellar envelope of an AGB star. The continuum is
produced by the star with a small contribution from dust grains comprising warm to hot SiC and cold
amorphous carbon. The HCN abundance distribution seems to be anisotropic. The ejected gas is accelerated
up to the terminal velocity (~8 km/s) from the photosphere to ~3R* but there is evidence of higher
velocities (>9-10 km/s) beyond this region. In the vicinity of Y CVn, the line widths are as high as
~10 km/s, which implies a maximum turbulent velocity of 6 km/s or the existence of other physical
mechanisms probably related to matter ejection that involve higher gas expansion velocities than
expected. HCN is rotationally and vibrationally out of LTE throughout the whole envelope. A difference
of about 1500 K in the rotational temperature at the photosphere is needed to explain the observations
at 7.5 and 13-14 um. Our analysis finds a total HCN column density that ranges from ~2.1E+18 to 3.5E+18
cm^{-2}, an abundance with respect to H2 of 3.5E-05 to 1.3E-04, and a 12C/13C isotopic ratio of ~2.5
throughout the whole envelope.

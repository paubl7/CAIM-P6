HR 6819 was reported in Rivinius et al. (2020) to be a triple system with a non-accreting black hole
(BH) in its inner binary. In our study we check if this inner binary can be reconstructed using the
isolated binary formation channel or the dynamical one within globular star clusters. Our goals
are to understand the formation of the inner binary and to test the presence of a non-accreting BH.
To simulate the inner binary evolution we assumed that the influence of the third body on the formation
of the inner binary is negligible. We tested various models with different values of physical parameters
such as the mass loss rate during BH formation or the efficiency of orbital energy loss for common
envelope ejection. By comparing the Roche lobe radii with the respective stellar radii no mass transfer
event was shown to happen for more than 40 Myr after the BH collapse, suggesting that no accretion
disk is supposed to form around the BH during the BH-MS phase. We can therefore reconstruct the system
with isolated binaries, although in our simulations we had to adopt non-standard parameter values
and to assume no asymmetric mass ejection during the black hole collapse. Out of the whole synthetic
Galactic disk BH population only 0.0001% of the BH-MS binaries fall within the observational constraints.
We expect only few binaries in the Galactic globular clusters to be potential candidates for the
HR 6819 system. Our statistical analysis suggests that despite the HR 6819 inner binary can be reconstructed
with isolated binary evolution, this evolutionary channel is unlikely to reproduce its reported
parameters. Under the initial assumption that the outer star doesn't impact the evolution of its
inner binary, we argue that the absence of a third body proposed by El-Badry & Quataert (2021) and
Bodensteiner, J. et al. (2020) might be a more natural explanation for the given observational data.

Stellar activity strongly affects and may prevent the detection of Earth-mass planets in the habitable
zone of solar-type stars with radial velocity technics. Astrometry is in principle less sensitive
to stellar activity because the situation is more favourable: the stellar astrometric signal is
expected to be fainter than the planetary astrometric signal compared to radial velocities. We
quantify the effect of stellar activity on high-precision astrometry when Earth-mass planets
are searched for in the habitable zone around old main-sequence solar-type stars. We used a very
large set of magnetic activity synthetic time series to characterise the properties of the stellar
astrometric signal. We then studied the detectability of exoplanets based on different approaches:
first based on the theoretical level of false positives derived from the synthetic time series,
and then with blind tests for old main-sequence F6-K4 stars. The amplitude of the signal can be up
to a few times the solar value depending on the assumptions made for activity level, spectral type,
and spot contrast. The detection rates for 1 MEarth planets are very good, however, with extremely
low false-positive rates in the habitable zone for stars in the F6-K4 range at 10 pc. The standard
false-alarm probability using classical bootstrapping on the time series strongly overestimates
the false-positive level. This affects the detection rates. We conclude that if technological
challenges can be overcome and very high precision is reached, astrometry is much more suitable
for detecting Earth-mass planets in the habitable zone around nearby solar-type stars than radial
velocity, and detection rates are much higher for this range of planetary masses and periods when
astrometric techniques are used than with radial velocity techniques.

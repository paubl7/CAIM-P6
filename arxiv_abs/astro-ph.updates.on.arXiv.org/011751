We introduce the Galaxy Intensity Mapping cross-COrrelation estimator (GIMCO), which is a new
tomographic estimator for the gravitational lensing potential, based on a combination of intensity
mapping (IM) and galaxy number counts. The estimator can be written schematically as IM$(z_f)\times$galaxy$(z_b)$
$-$ galaxy$(z_f)\times$IM$(z_b)$ for a pair of distinct redshifts $(z_f,z_b)$; this combination
allows to greatly reduce the contamination by density-density correlations, thus isolating the
lensing signal. As an estimator constructed only from cross-correlations, it is additionally
less susceptible to systematic effects. We show that the new estimator strongly suppresses cosmic
variance and consequently improves the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the detection of lensing,
especially on linear scales and intermediate redshifts. %This makes it particularly valuable
for future studies of dark energy and modified gravity. For cosmic variance dominated surveys,
the SNR of our estimator is a factor 30 larger than the SNR obtained from the correlation of galaxy
number counts only. Shot noise and interferometer noise reduce the SNR. For the specific example
of the Dark Energy Survey (DES) cross-correlated with the Hydrogen Intensity mapping and Real time
Analysis eXperiment (HIRAX), the SNR is around 4, whereas for Euclid cross-correlated with HIRAX
it reaches 52. This corresponds to an improvement of a factor 4-5 compared to the SNR from DES alone.
For Euclid cross-correlated with HIRAX the improvement with respect to Euclid alone strongly depends
on the redshift. We find that the improvement is particularly important for redshifts below 1.6,
where it reaches a factor of 5. This makes our estimator especially valuable to test dark energy and
modified gravity, that are expected to leave an impact at low and intermediate redshifts.

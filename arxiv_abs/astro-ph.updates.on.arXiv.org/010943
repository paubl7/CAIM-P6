The NASA-$\it{TESS}$ mission presents a treasure trove for understanding the stars it observes
and the Milky Way, in which they reside. We present a first look at the prospects for Galactic and stellar
astrophysics by performing initial asteroseismic analyses of bright ($G < 11$) red giant stars
in the $\it{TESS}$ Southern Continuous Viewing Zone (SCVZ). Using three independent pipelines,
we detect $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\Delta\nu$ in 41% of the 15,405 star parent sample (6,388 stars),
with consistency at a level of $\sim 2\%$ in $\nu_{\mathrm{max}}$ and $\sim 5\%$ in $\Delta\nu$.
Based on this, we predict that seismology will be attainable for $\sim 3\times10^{5}$ giants across
the whole sky, subject to improvements in analysis and data reduction techniques. The best quality
$\it{TESS}$-CVZ data, for 5,574 stars where pipelines returned consistent results, provide high
quality power spectra across a number of stellar evolutionary states. This makes possible studies
of, for example, the Asymptotic Giant Branch bump (AGBb). We demonstrate that mixed $\ell=1$ modes
and rotational splitting are cleanly observed in the 1-year data set. By combining $\it{TESS}$-CVZ
data with $\it{TESS}$-HERMES, $\it{SkyMapper}$, APOGEE and $\it{Gaia}$ we demonstrate the potential
for Galactic archaeology studies using the data, which provides good age precision and accuracy
that reproduces the age of high $\mathrm{[\alpha/Fe]}$ stars and relationships between mass and
kinematics from studies based on $\it{Kepler}$. Better quality astrometry and simpler target
selection than the $\it{Kepler}$ sample makes this data ideal for studies of the local star formation
history and evolution of the Galactic disc. These results provide a strong case for detailed spectroscopic
follow-up in the CVZs to complement that which has been (or will be) collected by current surveys.

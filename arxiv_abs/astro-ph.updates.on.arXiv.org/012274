We recover PH3 in the atmosphere of Venus in data taken with ALMA, using three different calibration
methods. The whole-planet signal is recovered with 5.4{\sigma} confidence using Venus bandpass
self-calibration, and two simpler approaches are shown to yield example 4.5-4.8{\sigma} detections
of the equatorial belt. Non-recovery by Villanueva et al. is attributable to (a) including areas
of the planet with high spectral-artefacts and (b) retaining all antenna baselines which raises
the noise by a factor ~2.5. We release a data-processing script that enables our whole-planet result
to be reproduced. The JCMT detection of PH3 remains robust, with the alternative SO2 attribution
proposed by Villanueva et al. appearing inconsistent both in line-velocity and with millimetre-wavelength
SO2 monitoring. SO2 contamination of the ALMA PH3-line is minimal. Net abundances for PH3, in the
gas column above ~55 km, are up to ~20 ppb planet-wide with JCMT, and ~7 ppb with ALMA (but with signal-loss
possible on scales approaching planetary size). Derived abundances will differ if PH3 occupies
restricted altitudes - molecules in the clouds will contribute significantly less absorption
at line-centre than equivalent numbers of mesospheric molecules - but in the latter zone, PH3 lifetime
is expected to be short. Given we recover phosphine, we suggest possible solutions (requiring substantial
further testing): a small collisional broadening coefficient could give narrow lines from lower
altitude, or a high eddy diffusion coefficient could allow molecules to survive longer at higher
altitudes. Alternatively, PH3 could be actively produced by an unknown mechanism in the mesosphere,
but this would need to be in addition to cloud-level PH3 detected retrospectively by Pioneer-Venus.

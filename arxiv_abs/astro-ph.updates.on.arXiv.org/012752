Given their prominent role in galaxy evolution, it is of paramount importance to unveil galaxy interactions
and merger events and to investigate the underlying mechanisms. The use of high-resolution data
makes it easier to identify merging systems, but it can still be challenging when the morphology
does not show any clear galaxy-pair or gas bridge. Characterising the origin of puzzling kinematic
features can help to reveal complicated systems. Here, we present a merging galaxy, MaNGA 1-114955,
in which we highlighted the superimposition of two distinct rotating discs along the line of sight.
These counter-rotating objects both lie on the star-forming main sequence but display perturbed
stellar velocity dispersions. The main galaxy presents off-centred star formation as well as off-centred
high-metallicity regions supporting the scenario of recent starbursts, while the secondary galaxy
hosts a central starburst which coincides with an extended radio emission, in excess with respect
to star formation expectations. Stellar mass as well as dynamical mass estimates agree towards
a mass ratio within the visible radius of 9:1 for these interacting galaxies. We suggest we are observing
a pre-coalescence stage of a merger. The primary galaxy has accreted gas through a past first pericentre
passage about 1 Gyr ago, and more recently from the secondary gas-rich galaxy, which exhibits an
underlying active galactic nucleus (AGN). Our results demonstrate how a galaxy can hide another
one and the relevance of a multi-component approach to study ambiguous systems. We anticipate our
method to be efficient at unveiling the mechanisms taking place in a sub-sample of galaxies observed
by the Mapping Nearby Galaxies at Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey, all exhibiting kinematic
features of puzzling origin in their gas emission lines.

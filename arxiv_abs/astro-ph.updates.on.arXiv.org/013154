Optical and near-UV continuum emissions in flares contribute substantially to flare energy budget.
Two mechanisms play an important role for continuum emission in flares: hydrogen recombination
after sudden ionization at chromospheric layers and transportation of the energy radiatively
from the chromosphere to lower layers in the atmosphere, the so called back-warming. The aim of the
paper is to disentangle between these two mechanisms for the excess of Balmer continuum observed
in a flare. Methods. We combine the observations of Balmer continuum obtained with IRIS (spectra
and SJIs 2832 A) and hard X-ray (HXR) emission detected by FERMI Gamma Burst Monitor (GBM) during
a mini flare. Calibrated Balmer continuum is compared to non-LTE radiative transfer flare models
and radiated energy is estimated. Assuming thick target HXR emission, we calculate the energy of
non-thermal electrons detected by FERMI GBM and compare it to the radiated energy. The favorable
argument of a relationship between the Balmer continuum excess and the HXR emission is that there
is a good time coincidence between both of them. In addition, the shape of the maximum brightness
in the 2832 SJIs, which is mainly due to this Balmer continuum excess, is similar to the FERMI/GBM
light curve. The electron-beam flux estimated from FERMI/GBM is consistent with the beam flux required
in non-LTE radiative transfer models to get the excess of Balmer continuum emission observed in
the IRIS spectra. The low energy input by non thermal electrons above 20 keV is sufficient to produce
the enhancement of Balmer continuum emission. This could be explained by the topology of the reconnection
site. The reconnection starts in a tiny bald patch region which is transformed dynamically in a X-point
current sheet. The size of the interacting region would be under the spatial resolution of the instrument.

We investigate the observational properties of a hydrogen-deficient superluminous supernova
(SLSN) SN 2020ank (at z = 0.2485), with the help of early phase observations carried out between $-$21
and +52 d since $g$-band maximum. Photometrically, SN 2020ank is one of the brightest SLSN ($M_{g,peak}$
$\sim$ $-$21.84 $\pm$ 0.10 mag), having fast pre-peak rising and post-peak decaying rates. The
bolometric light curve of SN 2020ank exhibits a higher peak luminosity ($L_{max}$) of $\sim$(3.9
$\pm$ 0.7) $\times$ 10$^{44}$ erg s$^{-1}$ and appears to be symmetric around the peak with $L^{rise}_{max}$/e
$\approx$ $L^{fall}_{max}$/e $\approx$ 15 d. The semi-analytical light-curve modelling using
the MINIM code suggests a spin down millisecond magnetar with $P_i$ $\sim$2.2 $\pm$ 0.5 ms and $B$
$\sim$(2.9 $\pm$ 0.1) $\times$ $10^{14}$ G as a possible powering source for SN 2020ank. The possible
magnetar origin and excess ultraviolet flux at early epochs indicate a central-engine based powering
source for SN 2020ank. Near-peak spectra of SN 2020ank are enriched with the W-shaped O II features
but with the weaker signatures of C II and Fe III. Using the estimated rise time of $\sim$27.9 d and
the photospheric velocity of $\sim$12050 km s$^{-1}$, we constrain the ejecta mass to $\sim$7.2
$M_{\odot}$ and the kinetic energy of $\sim$6.3 $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg. The near-peak spectrum
of SN 2020ank exhibits a close spectral resemblance with that of fast-evolving SN 2010gx. The absorption
features of SN 2020ank are blueshifted compared to Gaia16apd, suggesting a higher expansion velocity.
The spectral similarity with SN 2010gx and comparatively faster spectral evolution than PTF12dam
(a slow-evolving SLSN) indicate the fast-evolving behavior of SN 2020ank.

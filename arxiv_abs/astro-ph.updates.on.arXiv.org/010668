To constrain the emission mechanisms responsible for generating the energy powering the active
galactic nuclei (AGN) and their host galaxies, it is essential to disentangle the contributions
from both as a function of wavelength. Here we introduce a state-of-the-art AGN radio-to-X-ray
spectral energy distribution fitting model (ARXSED). ARXSED uses multiple components to replicate
the emission from the AGN and their hosts. At radio wavelengths, ARXSED accounts for radiation from
the radio structures (e.g., lobes,jets). At near-infrared to far-infrared wavelengths, ARXSED
combines a clumpy medium and a homogeneous disk to account for the radiation from the torus. At the
optical-UV and X-ray, ARXSED accounts for the emission from the accretion disk. An underlying component
from radio to UV wavelengths accounts for the emission from the host galaxy. Here we present the results
of ARXSED fits to the panchromatic SEDs of 20 radio-loud quasars from the 3CRR sample at $1<z\lesssim2$.
We find that a single power-law is unable to fit the radio emission when compact radio structures
(core, hot spots) are present. We find that the non-thermal emission from the quasars' radio structures
contributes significantly ($>70\%$) to the submm luminosity in half the sample, impacting the
submm-based star formation rate estimates. We present the median intrinsic SED of the radio-loud
quasars at $z>1$ and find that the median SED of \cite{Elvis1994} is unable to describe the SED of
the radio-selected AGN at $z>1$. The AGN torus and accretion disk parameters inferred from our fitting
technique agree with those in the literature for similar samples. We find that the orientation of
the torus/accretion disk does not line up with the inclination of the radio jets in our sample.

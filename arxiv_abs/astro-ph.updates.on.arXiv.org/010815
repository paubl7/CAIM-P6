We present Spitzer/IRAC observations of dust formation from six extragalactic carbon-rich Wolf-Rayet
(WC) binary candidates in low-metallicity (Z $\lesssim0.65$ Z$_\odot$) environments using multi-epoch
mid-infrared (IR) imaging data from the SPitzer InfraRed Intensive Transients Survey (SPIRITS).
Optical follow-up spectroscopy of SPIRITS 16ln, 19q, 16df, 18hb, and 14apu reveals emission features
from CIV $\lambda5801\text{-}12$ and/or the C III-IV $\lambda4650$/He II $\lambda4686$ blend
that are consistent with early-type WC stars. We identify SPIRITS 16ln as the variable mid-IR counterpart
of the recently discovered colliding-wind WC4+O binary candidate, N604-WRXc, located in the sub-solar
metallicity NGC 604 H II region in M33. We interpret the mid-IR variability from SPIRITS 16ln as a
dust-formation episode in an eccentric colliding-wind WC binary. SPIRITS 19q, 16df, 14apu, and
18hb exhibit absolute [3.6] magnitudes exceeding one of most IR-luminous dust-forming WC systems
known, WR 104 (M$_\mathrm{[3.6]}\lesssim-12.3$). An analysis of dust formation in the mid-IR
outburst from SPIRITS 19q reveals a high dust production rate of $\dot{M}_d=(8.2\pm0.5)\times10^{-6}$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$, which exceeds the dust production rate of the most efficient known dust-forming
WC systems such as WR 112 and WR 104. We demonstrate that efficient dust-formation is feasible from
early-type WC binaries in the theoretical framework of colliding-wind binary dust formation if
the systems host an O-type companion with a high mass-loss rates ($\dot{M}\gtrsim2\times10^{-6}$
M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$). This efficient dust-formation from early-type WC binaries highlights
their potential role as significant sources of dust in low-metallicity environments.

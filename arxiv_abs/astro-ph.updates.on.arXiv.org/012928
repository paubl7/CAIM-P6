Optical, near-infrared (NIR) photometric and spectroscopic studies along with the optical imaging
polarimetric results for SN 2012au to constrain the nature of the progenitor and other properties
are presented in this paper. Well-calibrated multi-band optical photometric data (from $-$0.2
to +413 d since $B$-band maximum) was used to compute the bolometric light curve and to perform semi$-$analytical
light-curve modelling using the $\texttt{MINIM}$ code. A spin-down millisecond magnetar-powered
model reasonably explains the observed photometric evolution of SN 2012au. Early time imaging
polarimetric follow-up observations ($-$2 to +31 d) and their comparison with other similar cases
indicate signatures of asphericity in the ejecta. Good spectral coverage of SN 2012au (from $-$5
to +391 d) allows us to trace the evolution of layers of SN ejecta in detail. SN 2012au exhibits higher
line velocities in comparison to the other SNe~Ib. Late nebular phase spectra of SN 2012au indicate
for a Wolf-Rayet star as the possible progenitor for SN 2012au, with oxygen, He-core, and main sequence
masses of $\sim$1.62 $\pm$ 0.15 M$_\odot$, $\sim$4$-$8 M$_\odot$, and $\sim$17$-$25 M$_\odot$,
respectively. There is a clear absence of first-overtone of the carbon monoxide (CO) features up
to +319 d in the $K$-band region of the NIR spectra. Overall analysis suggests that SN 2012au is one
of the most luminous slow-decaying Type Ib SN having comparatively higher ejecta mass ($\sim$4.7$-$8.3
M$_\odot$) and kinetic energy ($\sim$[4.8 $-$ 5.4] $\times$ 10$^{51}$ erg). Detailed modelling
using the $\texttt{MESA}$ and the results obtained through $\texttt{STELLA}$ and $\texttt{SNEC}$
explosions also strongly support spin-down of a magnetar as a possible powering source of SN 2012au
having mass around 20 M$_\odot$ and metallicity of Z = 0.04.

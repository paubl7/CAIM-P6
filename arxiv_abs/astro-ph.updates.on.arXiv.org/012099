We present new stellar mass functions at $z\sim6$, $z\sim7$, $z\sim8$, $z\sim9$ and, for the first
time, $z\sim10$, constructed from $\sim800$ Lyman-Break galaxies previously identified over
the XDF/UDF, parallels and the five CANDELS fields. Our study is distinctive due to (1) the much deeper
($\sim200$ hour) wide-area Spitzer/IRAC imaging at $3.6\mu$m and $4.5\mu$m from the GOODS Re-ionization
Era wide Area Treasury from Spitzer (GREATS) program and (2) consideration of $z\sim6-10$ sources
over a $3\times$ larger area than previous HST+Spitzer studies. The Spitzer/IRAC data enable $\ge2\sigma$
rest-frame optical detections for an unprecedented $50\%$ of galaxies down to a stellar mass limit
of $\sim10^{8}\mathcal{M}_\odot$ across all redshifts. Schechter fits to our volume densities
suggest a combined evolution in characteristic mass $\mathcal{M}^*$ and normalization factor
$\phi^*$ between $z\sim6$ and $z\sim8$. The stellar mass density (SMD) increases by $\sim1000\times$
in the $\sim500$ Myr between $z\sim10$ and $z\sim6$, with indications of a steeper evolution between
$z\sim10$ and $z\sim8$, similar to the previously-reported trend of the star-formation rate density.
Strikingly, abundance matching to the Bolshoi-Planck simulation indicates halo mass densities
evolving at approximately the same rate as the SMD between $z\sim10$ and $z\sim4$. Our results show
that the stellar-to-halo mass ratios, a proxy for the star-formation efficiency, do not change
significantly over the huge stellar mass build-up occurred from $z\sim10$ to $z\sim6$, indicating
that the assembly of stellar mass closely mirrors the build-up in halo mass in the first $\sim1$ Gyr
of cosmic history. JWST is poised to extend these results into the "first galaxy" epoch at $z\gtrsim10$.

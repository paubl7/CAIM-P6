We present optical follow-up imaging obtained with the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope, Las
Cumbres Observatory Global Telescope Network, Nickel Telescope, Swope Telescope, and Thacher
Telescope of the LIGO/Virgo gravitational wave (GW) signal from the neutron star-black hole (NSBH)
merger GW190814. We searched the GW190814 localization region (19 deg$^{2}$ for the 90th percentile
best localization), covering a total of 51 deg$^{2}$ and 94.6% of the two-dimensional localization
region. Analyzing the properties of 189 transients that we consider as candidate counterparts
to the NSBH merger, including their localizations, discovery times from merger, optical spectra,
likely host-galaxy redshifts, and photometric evolution, we conclude that none of these objects
are likely to be associated with GW190814. Based on this finding, we consider the likely optical
properties of an electromagnetic counterpart to GW190814, including possible kilonovae and short
gamma-ray burst afterglows. Using the joint limits from our follow-up imaging, we conclude that
a counterpart with an $r$-band decline rate of 0.68 mag day$^{-1}$, similar to the kilonova AT 2017gfo,
could peak at an absolute magnitude of at most $-17.8$ mag (50% confidence). Our data are not constraining
for ''red'' kilonovae and rule out ''blue'' kilonovae with $M>0.5 M_{\odot}$ (30% confidence).
We strongly rule out all known types of short gamma-ray burst afterglows with viewing angles $<$17$^{\circ}$
assuming an initial jet opening angle of $\sim$$5.2^{\circ}$ and explosion energies and circumburst
densities similar to afterglows explored in the literature. Finally, we explore the possibility
that GW190814 merged in the disk of an active galactic nucleus, of which we find four in the localization
region, but we do not find any candidate counterparts among these sources.

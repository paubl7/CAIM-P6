Cosmological simulations predict that galaxies are embedded into triaxial dark matter haloes,
which appear approximately elliptical in projection. Weak gravitational lensing allows us to
constrain these halo shapes and thereby test the nature of dark matter. Weak lensing has already
provided robust detections of the signature of halo flattening at the mass scales of groups and clusters,
whereas results for galaxies have been somewhat inconclusive. Here we combine data from five surveys
(NGVSLenS, KiDS/KV450, CFHTLenS, CS82, and RCSLenS) in order to tighten observational constraints
on galaxy-scale halo ellipticity for photometrically selected lens samples. We constrain $f_\rm{h}$,
the average ratio between the aligned component of the halo ellipticity and the ellipticity of the
light distribution, finding $f_\rm{h}=0.303^{+0.080}_{-0.079}$ for red lenses and $f_\rm{h}=0.217^{+0.160}_{-0.159}$
for blue lenses when assuming elliptical NFW density profiles and a linear scaling between halo
ellipticity and galaxy ellipticity. Our constraints for red galaxies constitute the currently
most significant ($3.8\sigma$) systematics-corrected detection of the signature of halo flattening
at the mass scale of galaxies. Our results are in good agreement with expectations from the Millennium
Simulation that apply the same analysis scheme and incorporate models for galaxy-halo misalignment.
Assuming these misalignment models and the analysis assumptions stated above are correct, our
measurements imply an average dark matter halo ellipticity for the studied red galaxy samples of
$\langle|\epsilon_\rm{h}|\rangle=0.174\pm 0.046$, where $|\epsilon_{h}|=(1-q)/(1+q)$
relates to the ratio $q=b/a$ of the minor and major axes of the projected mass distribution. Similar
measurements based on larger upcoming weak lensing data sets can help to calibrate models for intrinsic
galaxy alignments. [abridged]

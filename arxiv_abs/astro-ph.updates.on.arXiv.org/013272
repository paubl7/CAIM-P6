The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) is the future ground-based gamma-ray observatory and will
be composed of two arrays of imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescopes (IACTs) located in the Northern
and Southern hemispheres respectively. The first CTA prototype telescope built on-site, the Large-Sized
Telescope (LST-1), is under commissioning in La Palma and has already taken data on numerous known
sources. IACTs detect the faint flash of Cherenkov light indirectly produced after a very energetic
gamma-ray photon has interacted with the atmosphere and generated an atmospheric shower. Reconstruction
of the characteristics of the primary photons is usually done using a parameterization up to the
third order of the light distribution of the images. In order to go beyond this classical method,
new approaches are being developed using state-of-the-art methods based on convolutional neural
networks (CNN) to reconstruct the properties of each event (incoming direction, energy and particle
type) directly from the telescope images. While promising, these methods are notoriously difficult
to apply to real data due to differences (such as different levels of night sky background) between
Monte Carlo (MC) data used to train the network and real data. The GammaLearn project, based on these
CNN approaches, has already shown an increase in sensitivity on MC simulations for LST-1 as well
as a lower energy threshold. This work applies the GammaLearn network to real data acquired by LST-1
and compares the results to the classical approach that uses random forests trained on extracted
image parameters. The improvements on the background rejection, event direction, and energy reconstruction
are discussed in this contribution.

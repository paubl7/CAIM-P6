The Low-Frequency Array (LOFAR) Long-Baseline Calibrator Survey (LBCS) was conducted between
2014 and 2019 in order to obtain a set of suitable calibrators for the LOFAR array. In this paper we
present the complete survey, building on the preliminary analysis published in 2016 which covered
approximately half the survey area. The final catalogue consists of 30006 observations of 24713
sources in the northern sky, selected for a combination of high low-frequency radio flux density
and flat spectral index using existing surveys (WENSS, NVSS, VLSS, and MSSS). Approximately one
calibrator per square degree, suitable for calibration of $\geq$ 200 km baselines is identified
by the detection of compact flux density, for declinations north of 30 degrees and away from the Galactic
plane, with a considerably lower density south of this point due to relative difficulty in selecting
flat-spectrum candidate sources in this area of the sky. Use of the VLBA calibrator list, together
with statistical arguments by comparison with flux densities from lower-resolution catalogues,
allow us to establish a rough flux density scale for the LBCS observations, so that LBCS statistics
can be used to estimate compact flux densities on scales between 300 mas and 2 arcsec, for sources
observed in the survey. The LBCS can be used to assess the structures of point sources in lower-resolution
surveys, with significant reductions in the degree of coherence in these sources on scales between
2 arcsec and 300 mas. The LBCS survey sources show a greater incidence of compact flux density in quasars
than in radio galaxies, consistent with unified schemes of radio sources. Comparison with samples
of sources from interplanetary scintillation (IPS) studies with the Murchison Widefield Array
(MWA) shows consistent patterns of detection of compact structure in sources observed both interferometrically
with LOFAR and using IPS.

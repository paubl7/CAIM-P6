Observing simultaneously pulsed radio and gamma-ray emission from these stars helps to constrain
the geometry and radiation mechanisms within their magnetosphere and to localize the multiple
photon production sites. In this paper, we fit the time-aligned gamma-ray light-curves of young
radio-loud gamma-ray pulsars. We assume a dipole force-free magnetosphere where radio photons
emanate from high altitude above the polar caps and gamma-rays originate from outside the light-cylinder,
within the striped wind current sheet. We compute a full atlas of radio and gamma-ray pulse profiles
depending on the magnetic axis obliquity and line of sight inclination with respect to the neutron
star rotation axis. By applying a $\rchi^2$ fitting technique, we are able to pin down accurately
the magnetosphere geometry. Further constrains are obtained from radio polarization measurement
following the rotating vector model, including aberration and retardation effects. We found a
good agreement between our model and the time-aligned single or double peaked gamma-ray pulsar
observations. We deduce the magnetic inclination angle and the observer line of sight with respect
to the rotation axis within a small error bar. The distinction between radio-loud or radio-quiet
gamma-ray pulsars or only radio pulsars can entirely be related to the geometry of the associated
emitting regions. The high altitude polar cap model combined with the striped wind represents a
minimalistic approach able to reproduce a wealth of gamma-ray pulse profiles for young radio pulsars.
Based on self-consistent force-free simulations, it gives a full geometrical picture of the emission
properties without resorting to detailed knowledge of the individual particle dynamics and energetics.

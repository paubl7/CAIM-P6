Methyl isocyanate (CH$_{3}$NCO) and glycolonitrile (HOCH$_{2}$CN) are isomers and prebiotic
molecules that are involved in the formation of peptide structures and the nucleobase adenine,
respectively. ALMA observations of the intermediate-mass Class 0 protostar Serpens SMM1-a and
ALMA-PILS data of the low-mass Class 0 protostar IRAS~16293B are used. Spectra are analysed with
the CASSIS line analysis software package in order to identify and characterise molecules. CH$_{3}$NCO,
HOCH$_{2}$CN, and various other molecules are detected towards SMM1-a. HOCH$_{2}$CN is identified
in the PILS data towards IRAS~16293B in a spectrum extracted at a half-beam offset position from
the peak continuum. CH$_{3}$NCO and HOCH$_{2}$CN are equally abundant in SMM1-a at [X]/[CH$_{3}$OH]
of 5.3$\times$10$^{-4}$ and 6.2$\times$10$^{-4}$, respectively. A comparison between SMM1-a
and IRAS~16293B shows that HOCH$_{2}$CN and HNCO are more abundant in the former source, but CH$_{3}$NCO
abundances do not differ significantly. Data from other sources are used to show that the [CH$_{3}$NCO]/[HNCO]
ratio is similar in all these sources within $\sim$10\%. The new detections of CH$_{3}$NCO and HOCH$_{2}$CN
are additional evidence for a large interstellar reservoir of prebiotic molecules that can contribute
to the formation of biomolecules on terrestrial planets. A plausible formation pathway for HOCH$_{2}$CN
is the thermal Strecker-like reaction of CN$^{-}$ with H$_{2}$CO. The similar [CH$_{3}$NCO]/[HNCO]
ratios indicate that these two species either are chemically related or their formation is affected
by physical conditions in the same way. The relatively high abundances of HOCH$_{2}$CN and HNCO
in SMM1-a may be explained by a prolonged stage of relatively warm ice mantles, where thermal and
energetic processing of HCN in the ice results in the efficient formation of both species.

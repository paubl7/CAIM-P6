Sub-Neptunes (Rp~1.25-4 REarth) remain the most commonly detected exoplanets to date. However,
it remains difficult for observations to tell whether these intermediate-sized exoplanets have
surfaces and where their surfaces are located. Here we propose that the abundances of trace species
in the visible atmospheres of these sub-Neptunes can be used as proxies for determining the existence
of surfaces and approximate surface conditions. As an example, we used a state-of-the-art photochemical
model to simulate the atmospheric evolution of K2-18b and investigate its final steady-state composition
with surfaces located at different pressures levels (Psurf). We find the surface location has a
significant impact on the atmospheric abundances of trace species, making them deviate significantly
from their thermochemical equilibrium and "no-surface" conditions. This result arises primarily
because the pressure-temperature conditions at the surface determine whether photochemically-produced
species can be recycled back to their favored thermochemical-equilibrium forms and transported
back to the upper atmosphere. For an assumed H2-rich atmosphere for K2-18b, we identify seven chemical
species that are most sensitive to the existence of surfaces: ammonia (NH3), methane (CH4), hydrogen
cyanide (HCN), acetylene (C2H2), ethane (C2H6), carbon monoxide (CO), and carbon dioxide (CO2).
The ratio between the observed and the no-surface abundances of these species, can help distinguish
the existence of a shallow surface (Psurf < 10 bar), an intermediate surface (10 bar < Psurf < 100 bar),
and a deep surface (Psurf > 100 bar). This framework can be applied together with future observations
to other sub-Neptunes of interest.

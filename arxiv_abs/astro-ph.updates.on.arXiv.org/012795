We report a discovery of a new X-ray-selected supernova remnant (SNR) candidate SGRe~J0023-3633
= G116.6-26.1 found in the data of \textit{SRG}/eROSITA all-sky survey. The source features a large
angular extent ($\sim 4$ deg in diameter), nearly circular shape, and soft spectrum of the X-ray
emission, dominated by emission lines of helium- and hydrogen-like oxygen, with the estimated
absorption column density consistent with the line-of-sight integral in that direction. It lacks
bright counterparts of similar extent at other wavelengths which could be unequivocally associated
with it. Given the relatively high Galactic latitude of the source, $b\approx-26$ deg, we interpret
these observational properties as an indication of the off-disk location of this SNR candidate.
Namely, we propose that this object originated from a Type Ia supernova which exploded some 40 000
yr ago in the low density ($\sim 10^{-3}\,{\rm cm^{-3}}$) and hot ($\sim (1-2)\times10^6\,{\rm
K}$) gas of the Milky Way halo at a distance of $\sim 3\,{\rm kpc}$ from the Sun. The low density of the
halo gas implies that various collisional time scales, in particular, the cooling time and the collisional
ionization equilibrium (CEI) time for the gas downstream of the forward shock are much longer than
the age of the SNR. This should result in a specific combination of the relatively soft spectrum,
reflecting the pre-shock ionization state of the gas, and a strong boost in the plasma emissivity
(compared to CEI) due to enhanced collisional excitation through the increased electron temperature.
If confirmed, such a rare object would provide us with a unique "in situ" probe of physical conditions
(density, temperature, and metallicity) near the interface between the Milky Way's disk and the
halo.

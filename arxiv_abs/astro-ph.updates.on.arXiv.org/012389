Context. The Sun's complex corona is the source of the solar wind and interplanetary magnetic field.
While the large scale morphology is well understood, the impact of variations in coronal properties
on the scale of a few degrees on properties of the interplanetary medium is not known. Solar Orbiter,
carrying both remote sensing and in situ instruments into the inner solar system, is intended to
make these connections better than ever before. Aims. We combine remote sensing and in situ measurements
from Solar Orbiter's first perihelion at 0.5 AU to study the fine scale structure of the solar wind
from the equatorward edge of a polar coronal hole with the aim of identifying characteristics of
the corona which can explain the in situ variations. Methods. We use in situ measurements of the magnetic
field, density and solar wind speed to identify structures on scales of hours at the spacecraft.
Using Potential Field Source Surface mapping we estimate the source locations of the measured solar
wind as a function of time and use EUI images to characterise these solar sources. Results. We identify
small scale stream interactions in the solar wind with compressed magnetic field and density along
with speed variations which are associated with corrugations in the edge of the coronal hole on scales
of several degrees, demonstrating that fine scale coronal structure can directly influence solar
wind properties and drive variations within individual streams. Conclusions. This early analysis
already demonstrates the power of Solar Orbiter's combined remote sensing and in situ payload and
shows that with future, closer perihelia it will be possible dramatically to improve our knowledge
of the coronal sources of fine scale solar wind structure, which is important both for understanding
the phenomena driving the solar wind and predicting its impacts at the Earth and elsewhere.

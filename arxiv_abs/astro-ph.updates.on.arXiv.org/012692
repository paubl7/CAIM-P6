We present a comprehensive analytic model of a relativistic jet propagation in expanding media.
This model is the first to cover the entire jet evolution from early to late times, as well as a range
of configurations that are relevant to binary neutron star mergers. These include low and high luminosity
jets, unmagnetized and mildly magnetized jets, time-dependent luminosity jets, and Newtonian
and relativistic head velocities. We also extend the existing solution of jets in a static medium
to power-law density media with index $\alpha<5$. Our model, which is tested and calibrated by a
suite of 3D RMHD simulations, provides simple analytic formulae for the jet head propagation and
breakout times, as well as a simple breakout criterion which depends only on the jet to ejecta energy
ratio and jet opening angle. Assuming a delay time $ t_d $ between the onset of a homologous ejecta
expansion and jet launching, the system evolution has two main regimes: strong and weak jets. The
regime depends on the ratio between the jet head velocity in the ejecta frame and the local ejecta
velocity, denoted as $ \eta $. Strong jets start their propagation in the ejecta on a timescale shorter
than $t_d$ with $\eta \gg 1$, and within several ejecta dynamical times $\eta$ drops below unity.
Weak jets are unable to penetrate the ejecta at first (start with $\eta \ll 1$), and breach the ejecta
only after the ejecta expands over a timescale longer than $ t_d $, thus their evolution is independent
of $ t_d $. After enough time, both strong and weak jets approach an asymptotic phase where $\eta$
is constant. Applying our model to short GRBs, we find that there is most likely a large diversity
of ejecta mass, where mass $ \lesssim 10^{-3}~{\rm M}_{\odot} $ (at least along the poles) is common.

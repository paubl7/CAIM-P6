We have recently developed a method to kinematically decompose simulated galaxies that helps to
break the degeneracy among galactic stellar structures. For example, the concept of stellar halos
is generalized to weakly-rotating structures that are composed of loosely bound stars, which can
hence be associated to both disk and elliptical type morphologies. By applying this method to about
500 central galaxies with stellar mass $10^{10-11.5}\ M_\odot$ from the TNG50 simulation at $z=0$,
we identify three broadly-defined types of galaxies: ones dominated by disk, by bulge, or by stellar
halo structures. We then use the simulation to infer the underlying connection between the growth
of structures and physical processes over cosmic time. Tracing galaxies back in time, we recognize
three fundamental regimes: an early phase of evolution ($z\gtrsim2$), and internal and external
(mainly mergers) processes that act at later times. We find that disk- and bulge-dominated galaxies
are not significantly affected by mergers since $z\sim2$; the difference in their present-day
structures originates from two distinct evolutionary pathways, extended vs. compact, that are
likely determined by their parent dark matter halos in the early phase; i.e., nature. On the other
hand, normal elliptical galaxies are typically halo-dominated, forming by external processes
(e.g. major mergers) in the later phase, i.e., nurture. This picture challenges the general idea
that elliptical galaxies are the same objects as classical bulges in disk galaxies. In observations,
both bulge- and halo-dominated galaxies are likely to be classified as early-type galaxies with
compact morphology and quiescent star formation. However, here we find them to have very different
evolutionary histories.

The stability and other physical properties of a class of regular black holes, quasiblack holes,
and other electrically charged compact objects are investigated in the present work. The compact
objects are obtained by solving the Einstein-Maxwell system of equations assuming spherical symmetry
in a static spacetime. The spacetime is split in two regions by a spherical surface of coordinate
radius $a$. The interior region contains a non-isotropic charged fluid with a de Sitter type equation
of state, $p_r = -\rho_m$, $p_r$ and $\rho_m$ being respectively the radial pressure and the energy
density of the fluid. The charge distribution is chosen as a well behaved power-law function. The
exterior region is the electrovacuum Reissner-Nordstr\"om metric, which is joined to the interior
metric through a spherical thin shell (a thin matter layer) placed at the radius $a$. The matter of
the shell is assumed to be a perfect fluid satisfying a linear barotropic equation of state, ${\cal
P}=\omega\sigma$, with ${\cal P}$ and $\sigma$ being respectively the pressure and energy density
of the shell, with $\omega$ being a constant. The exact solutions obtained are analyzed in some detail
by exploring the interesting regions of parameter space, complementing the analysis of previous
works is similar models. This is the first important contribution of the present study. The stability
of the solutions are then investigated considering perturbations around the equilibrium position
of the shell. This is the second and the most important contribution of this work. We find that there
are stable objects in relatively large regions of the parameter space. In particular, there are
stable regular black holes for all values of the parameter $\omega$ of interest. Other stable ultracompact
objects as quasiblack holes, gravastars, and even overcharged stars are allowed in certain regions
of the parameter space.

Previous studies of the stellar mean metallicity and [Mg/Fe] values of massive elliptical (E)~galaxies
suggest that their stars were formed in a very short timescale which cannot be reconciled with estimates
from stellar population synthesis (SPS) studies and with hierarchical-assembly. Applying the
previously developed chemical evolution code, GalIMF, which allows an environment-dependent
stellar initial mass function (IMF) to be applied in the integrated galaxy initial mass function
(IGIMF) theory instead of an invariant canonical IMF, the star formation timescales (SFT) of E galaxies
are re-evaluated. The code's uniqueness lies in it allowing the galaxy-wide IMF and associated
chemical enrichment to evolve as the physical conditions in the galaxy change. The calculated SFTs
become consistent with the independent SPS results if the number of type Ia supernovae (SNIa) per
unit stellar mass increases for more massive E~galaxies. This is a natural outcome of galaxies with
higher star-formation rates producing more massive star clusters, spawning a larger number of
SNIa progenitors per star. The calculations show E~galaxies with a stellar mass $\approx 10^{9.5}
M_\odot$ to have had the longest mean SFTs of $\approx2\,$Gyr. The bulk of more massive E~galaxies
were formed faster (SFT$\,\approx 1\,$Gyr) leading to domination by M~dwarf stars and larger dynamical
mass-to-light ratios as observed, while lower-mass galaxies tend to lose their gas supply more
easily due to their shallower potential and therefore also have similarly-short mean SFTs. This
work achieves, for the first time, consistency of the SFTs for early-type galaxies between chemical-enrichment
and SPS modelling and leads to an improved understanding of how the star formation environment may
affect the total number of SNIa per unit stellar mass formed.

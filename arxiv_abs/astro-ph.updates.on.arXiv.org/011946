Strongly lensed explosive transients such as supernovae, gamma-ray bursts, fast radio bursts,
and gravitational waves are very promising tools to determine the Hubble constant ($H_0$) in the
near future in addition to strongly lensed quasars. In this work, we show that the transient nature
of the point source provides an advantage over quasars: the lensed host galaxy can be observed before
or after the transient's appearance. Therefore, the lens model can be derived from images free of
the contamination from bright point sources. We quantify this advantage by comparing the precision
of lens model obtained from the same lenses with and without point sources. Based on the Hubble space
telescope (HST) Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) observation with the same sets of lensing parameters,
we simulate realistic mock datasets of 48 quasar lensing systems (i.e., adding AGN in the galaxy
center) and 48 galaxy--galaxy lensing systems (assuming the transient source is not-visible but
the time delay and image positions have been or will be measured). We then model the images and compare
the inferences of the lens model parameters and $H_0$. We find that the precision of the lens models
(in terms of the deflector mass slope) is better by a factor of 4.1 for the sample without lensed point
sources, resulting in an increase of $H_0$ precision by a factor of 2.9. The opportunity to observe
the lens systems without the transient point sources provides an additional advantage for time-delay
cosmography over lensed quasars. It facilitates the determination of higher signal-to-noise
stellar kinematics of the main deflector, and thus its mass density profile, which in turn plays
a key role in breaking the mass-sheet degeneracy and constraining $H_0$.

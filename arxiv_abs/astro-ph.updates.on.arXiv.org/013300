We present the third and final data release of the K2 Galactic Archaeology Program (K2 GAP) for Campaigns
C1-C8 and C10-C18. We provide asteroseismic radius and mass coefficients, $\kappa_R$ and $\kappa_M$,
for $\sim 19,000$ red giant stars, which translate directly to radius and mass given a temperature.
As such, K2 GAP DR3 represents the largest asteroseismic sample in the literature to date. K2 GAP
DR3 stellar parameters are calibrated to be on an absolute parallactic scale based on Gaia DR2, with
red giant branch and red clump evolutionary state classifications provided via a machine-learning
approach. Combining these stellar parameters with GALAH DR3 spectroscopy, we determine asteroseismic
ages with precisions of $\sim 20-30\%$ and compare age-abundance relations to Galactic chemical
evolution models among both low- and high-$\alpha$ populations for $\alpha$, light, iron-peak,
and neutron-capture elements. We confirm recent indications in the literature of both increased
Ba production at late Galactic times, as well as significant contribution to r-process enrichment
from prompt sources associated with, e.g., core-collapse supernovae. With an eye toward other
Galactic archaeology applications, we characterize K2 GAP DR3 uncertainties and completeness
using injection tests, suggesting K2 GAP DR3 is largely unbiased in mass/age and with uncertainties
of $2.9\%\,(\rm{stat.})\,\pm0.1\%\,(\rm{syst.})$ & $6.7\%\,(\rm{stat.})\,\pm0.3\%\,(\rm{syst.})$
in $\kappa_R$ & $\kappa_M$ for red giant branch stars and $4.7\%\,(\rm{stat.})\,\pm0.3\%\,(\rm{syst.})$
& $11\%\,(\rm{stat.})\,\pm0.9\%\,(\rm{syst.})$ for red clump stars. We also identify percent-level
asteroseismic systematics, which are likely related to the time baseline of the underlying data,
and which therefore should be considered in TESS asteroseismic analysis.

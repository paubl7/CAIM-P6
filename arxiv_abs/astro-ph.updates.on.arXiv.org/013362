The Far-UV Off Rowland-circle Telescope for Imaging and Spectroscopy (FORTIS) has been successful
in maturing technologies for carrying out multi-object spectroscopy in the far-UV, including:
the successful implementation of the Next Generation of Microshutter Arrays; large-area microchannel
plate detectors; and an aspheric "dual-order" holographically ruled diffraction grating with
curved, variably-spaced grooves with a laminar (rectangular) profile. These optical elements
were used to construct an efficient and minimalist "two-bounce" spectro-telescope in a Gregorian
configuration. However, the susceptibility to Lyman alpha (Ly$\alpha$) scatter inherent to the
dual order design has been found to be intractably problematic, motivating our move to an "Off-Axis"
design. OAxFORTIS will mitigate its susceptibility to Ly$\alpha$ by enclosing the optical path,
so the detector only receives light from the grating. The new design reduces the collecting area
by a factor of 2, but the overall effective area can be regained and improved through the use of new
high efficiency reflective coatings, and with the use of a blazed diffraction grating. This latter
key technology has been enabled by recent advancements in creating very high efficiency blazed
gratings with impressive smoothness using electron beam lithography and chemical etching to create
grooves in crystalline silicon. Here we discuss the derivation for the OAxFORTIS grating solution
as well as methods used to transform the FORTIS holographic grating recording parameters (following
the formalism of Noda et al.1974a,b), into curved and variably-spaced rulings required to drive
the electron beam lithography write-head in three dimensions. We will also discuss the process
for selecting silicon wafers with the proper orientation of the crystalline planes and give an update
on our fabrication preparations.

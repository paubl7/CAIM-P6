We present results of the cross-correlation Ly$\alpha$ intensity mapping with Subaru/Hyper Suprime-Cam
(HSC) ultra-deep narrowband images and Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) at $z=5.7$ and $6.6$ in a total
area of $4$ deg$^2$. Although overwhelming amount of data quality controls have been performed
for the narrowband images, we further conduct extensive analysis evaluating systematics of large-scale
point-spread-function wings, sky subtractions, and unknown errors based on physically uncorrelated
signals and sources found in real HSC images and object catalogs, respectively. Removing the systematics,
we carefully calculate cross-correlations between Ly$\alpha$ intensity of the narrowband images
and the LAEs. We tentatively identify very diffuse Ly$\alpha$ emission with the $\simeq 3\sigma$
($\simeq 2\sigma$) significance at $\gtrsim$ 100 comoving kpc (ckpc) far from the LAEs at $z=5.7$
($6.6$), around and probably even beyond a virial radius of star-forming galaxies with $M_\mathrm{h}\sim10^{11}M_\odot$.
The diffuse Ly$\alpha$ emission possibly extends up to $1$,$000$ ckpc with the surface brightness
of $10^{-20}$-$10^{-19}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ arcsec$^{-2}$. We confirm that the small-scale
($<150$ ckpc) Ly$\alpha$ radial profiles of LAEs are consistent with those obtained by recent MUSE
observations. Comparisons with numerical simulations suggest that the large-scale ($\sim150$-$1$,$000$
ckpc) Ly$\alpha$ emission are not explained by unresolved faint neighboring galaxies including
satellites, but by a combination of Ly$\alpha$ photons emitted from the central LAE and other unknown
sources, such as cold-gas streams and galactic outflow. We find no evolution in the Ly$\alpha$ radial
profiles of our LAEs from $z=5.7$ to $6.6$, where theoretical models predict a flattening of the
profile slope made by cosmic reionization, albeit with our moderately large observational errors.

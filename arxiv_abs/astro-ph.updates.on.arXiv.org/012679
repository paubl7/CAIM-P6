Narrow-band imaging surveys allow the study of the spectral characteristics of galaxies without
the need of performing their spectroscopic follow-up. In this work, we forward-model the Physics
of the Accelerating Universe Survey (PAUS) narrow-band data. The aim is to improve the constraints
on the spectral coefficients used to create the galaxy spectral energy distributions (SED) of the
galaxy population model in Tortorelli et al. 2020. In that work, the model parameters were inferred
from the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope Legacy Survey (CFHTLS) data using Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC). This led to stringent constraints on the B-band galaxy luminosity function
parameters, but left the spectral coefficients only broadly constrained. To address that, we perform
an ABC inference using CFHTLS and PAUS data. This is the first time our approach combining forward-modelling
and ABC is applied simultaneously to multiple datasets. We test the results of the ABC inference
by comparing the narrow-band magnitudes of the observed and simulated galaxies using Principal
Component Analysis, finding a very good agreement. Furthermore, we prove the scientific potential
of the constrained galaxy population model to provide realistic stellar population properties
by measuring them with the SED fitting code CIGALE. We use CFHTLS broad-band and PAUS narrow-band
photometry for a flux-limited ($\mathrm{i}<22.5$) sample of galaxies spanning the redshift range
$\mathrm{0<z<1.0}$. We find that properties like stellar masses, star-formation rates, mass-weighted
stellar ages and metallicities are in agreement within errors between observations and simulations.
Overall, this work shows the ability of our galaxy population model to correctly forward-model
a complex dataset such as PAUS and the ability to reproduce the diversity of galaxy properties at
the redshift range spanned by CFHTLS and PAUS.

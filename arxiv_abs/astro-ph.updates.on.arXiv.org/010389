The nebular circumstellar environments of cool evolved stars are known to harbour a rich morphological
complexity of gaseous structures on different length scales. A large part of these density structures
are thought to be brought about by the interaction of the stellar wind with a close companion. The
S-type asymptotic giant branch star Pi1 Gruis, which has a known companion at ~440 au and is thought
to harbour a second, closer-by (<10 au) companion, was observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array as part of the ATOMIUM Large programme. In this work, the brightest CO, SiO, and HCN molecular
line transitions are analysed. The continuum map shows two maxima, separated by 0.04'' (6 au). The
CO data unambiguously reveal that Pi1 Gru's circumstellar environment harbours an inclined, radially
outflowing, equatorial density enhancement. It contains a spiral structure at an angle of 38+/-3
deg with the line-of-sight. The HCN emission in the inner wind reveals a clockwise spiral, with a
dynamical crossing time of the spiral arms consistent with a companion at a distance of 0.04'' from
the asymptotic giant branch star, which is in agreement with the position of the secondary continuum
peak. The inner wind dynamics imply a large acceleration region, consistent with a beta-law power
of ~6. The CO emission suggests that the spiral is approximately Archimedean within 5'', beyond
which this trend breaks down as the succession of the spiral arms becomes less periodic. The SiO emission
at scales smaller than 0.5'' exhibits signatures of gas in rotation, which is found to fit the expected
behaviour of gas in the wind-companion interaction zone. An investigation of SiO maser emission
reveals what could be a stream of gas accelerating from the surface of the AGB star to the companion.
Using these dynamics, we have tentatively derived an upper limit on the companion mass to be ~1.1
Msol.

We analyzed the daily sunspot-group data reported by the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results
(GPR) during the period 1874-1976 and Debrecen Photoheligraphic Data (DPD) during the period 1977-2017,
and the revised Version-2 of ISSN during the period 1874-2017. We determined the amplitude of the
Solar Cycles 12-24 and the 13-month smoothed monthly mean corrected areas of the sunspot groups
in the Sun's whole-sphere (WSGA), northern hemisphere (NSGA), and southern hemisphere (SSGA)
at the epochs of the maxima of the Solar Cycles 12-24. Using all these we obtained the relations similar
to that found in our earlier analyzes -- i.e., the existence of a high correlation between the sum
of the areas of sunspot groups in the southern-hemisphere near-equatorial band during a small interval
(7-9 months) just after a maximum epoch of a solar cycle and the amplitude of next solar cycle -- separately
for the Sun's whole-sphere and northern- and southern-hemispheres. By using these relations we
predicted ~701 msh (millionth of solar hemisphere), ~429 msh, and ~366 msh for the values of WSGA,
NSGA, and SSGA, respectively, at the maximum epoch of the Solar Cycle 25. We predicted 86 + or - 18 for
the amplitude of Solar Cycle 25. The 13-month smoothed monthly mean sunspot-group area highly correlate
with that of ISSN. Using this relation and the predicted values of WSGA, NSGA, and SSGA we have obtained
68 + or -11 for the amplitude of Solar Cycle 25, which is slightly lower than the aforementioned predicted
value, and 39 + or - 4 and 31 + or - 6 for the values of northern- and southern-hemispheres' sunspot numbers
at the maximum epoch of Solar Cycle 25. Overall, our results suggest that the amplitude of Solar Cycle
25 would be 25%-40% smaller, and the corresponding north-south asymmetry would be much smaller,
than those of Solar Cycle 24.

Wolf-Rayet stars are amongst the rarest but also most intriguing massive stars. Their extreme stellar
winds induce famous multi-wavelength circumstellar gas nebulae of various morphologies, spanning
from circles and rings to bipolar shapes. This study is devoted to the investigation of the formation
of young, asymmetric Wolf-Rayet gas nebulae and we present a 2.5-dimensional magneto-hydrodynamical
toy model for the simulation of Wolf-Rayet gas nebulae generated by wind-wind interaction. Our
method accounts for stellar wind asymmetries, rotation, magnetisation, evolution and mixing
of materials. It is found that the morphology of the Wolf-Rayet nebulae of blue supergiant ancestors
is tightly related to the wind geometry and to the stellar phase transition time interval, generating
either a broadened peanut-like or a collimated jet-like gas nebula. Radiative transfer calculations
of our Wolf-Rayet nebulae for dust infrared emission at 24 $\mu$m show that the projected diffuse
emission can appear as oblate, bipolar, ellipsoidal or ring structures. Important projection
effects are at work in shaping observed Wolf-Rayet nebulae. This might call a revision of the various
classifications of Wolf-Rayet shells, which are mostly based on their observed shape. Particularly,
our models question the possibility of producing pre-Wolf-Rayet wind asymmetries, responsible
for bipolar nebulae like NGC 6888, within the single red supergiant evolution channel scenario.
We propose that bipolar Wolf-Rayet nebulae can only be formed within the red supergiant scenario
by multiple/merged massive stellar systems, or by single high-mass stars undergoing additional,
e.g. blue supergiant, evolutionary stages prior to the Wolf-Rayet phase.

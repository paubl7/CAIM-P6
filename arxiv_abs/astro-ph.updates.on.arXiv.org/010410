Shocks are a universal feature of the lower solar atmosphere which consists of both ionised and neutral
species. Including partial ionisation leads to a finite-width existing for shocks, where the ionised
and neutral species decouple and recouple. As such, drift velocities exist within the shock that
lead to frictional heating between the two species, in addition to the adiabatic temperature changes
across the shock. The local temperature enhancements within the shock alter the recombination
and ionisation rates and hence change the composition of the plasma. We study the role of collisional
ionisation and recombination in slow-mode partially-ionised shocks. In particular we incorporate
the ionisation potential energy loss and analyse the consequences of having a non-conservative
energy equation. A semi-analytical approach is used to determine the possible equilibrium shock
jumps for a two-fluid model with ionisation, recombination, ionisation potential and arbitrary
heating. Two-fluid numerical simulations are performed using the (P\underline{I}P) code. Results
are compared to the MHD model and semi-analytic solution. Accounting for ionisation, recombination
and ionisation potential significantly alters the behaviour of shocks in both substructure and
post-shock regions. In particular, for a given temperature, equilibrium can only exist for specific
densities due to the radiative losses needing to be balanced by the heating function. A consequence
of the ionisation potential is that a compressional shock will lead to a reduction of temperature
in the post-shock region, rather than the increase seen for MHD. The numerical simulations pair
well with the derived analytic model for shock velocities.

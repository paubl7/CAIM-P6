The NASA concept mission ORCAS (Orbiting Configurable Artificial Star) aims to provide near diffraction-limited
angular resolution at visible and near-infrared wavelengths using laser signals from space-based
cubesats as Adaptive Optics beacons for ground-based 8-30 meter telescopes, in particular the
10 meter Keck Telescopes. When built as designed, ORCAS+Keck would deliver images of ~0.01-0.02"
FWHM at 0.5-1.2 micron wavelength that reach AB<31 mag for point sources in a few hours over a 5x5"
FOV that includes IFU capabilities. We summarize the potential of high-resolution faint galaxy
science with ORCAS. We show that the ability to detect optical-near-IR point sources with r_e>0.01"
FWHM to AB<31 mag will yield about 5.0x10^6 faint star-forming (SF) clumps per square degree, or
~0.4 per arcsec^2. From recent HST lensing data, the typical intrinsic (unlensed) sizes of SF clumps
at z~1-7 will be r_e ~1-80 m.a.s. to AB<31 mag, with intrinsic (unmagnified) fluxes as faint as AB<35-36
mag when searching with ORCAS around the critical curves of lensing clusters imaged with HST and
JWST. About half of these SF clumps will have sizes below the ORCAS diffraction limit, and the other
half will be slightly resolved, but still mostly above the ORCAS surface brightness (SB) limits.
ORCAS will address how galaxies assemble from smaller clumps to stable disks by measuring ages,
metallicities, and gradients of clumps within galaxies. ORCAS can monitor caustic transits of
individual stars in SF clumps at z>1-2 that have been detected with HST, and those that may be detected
with JWST at z>6 at extreme magnifications (mu>10^3-10^5) for the first stars and their stellar
mass black hole accretion disks. ORCAS provides a unique opportunity to obtain a statistical census
of individual stars at cosmological distances, leveraging the largest telescopes only available
on the ground.

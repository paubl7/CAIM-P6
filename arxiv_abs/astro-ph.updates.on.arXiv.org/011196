The Institute for Astronomy and Astrophysics in T\"ubingen (IAAT) has a long-term experience in
developing and building space-qualified imaging and photon counting microchannel-plate (MCP)
detectors, which are sensitive in the ultraviolet wavelength range. Our goal is to achieve high
quantum efficiency and spatial resolution, while maintaining solar blindness and low-noise characteristics.
Our flexible detector design is currently tailored to the specific needs of three missions: For
the ESBO DS (European Stratospheric Balloon Observatory Design Study) we provide a sealed detector
to the STUDIO instrument (Stratospheric Ultraviolet Demonstrator of an Imaging Observatory),
a 50 cm telescope with a UV imager for operation at an altitude of 37-41 km. In collaboration with the
Indian Institute of Astrophysics we plan a space mission with a CubeSat-sized far-ultraviolet
spectroscopic imaging instrument, featuring an open version of our detector. A Chinese mission,
led by the Purple Mountain Observatory, comprises a multi-channel imager using open and sealed
detector versions. Our MCP detector has a cesium activated p-doped gallium-nitride photocathode.
Other photocathode materials like cesium-telluride or potassium-bromide could be used as an alternative.
For the sealed version, the photocathode is operated in semi-transparent mode on a MgF$_2$ window
with a cut-off wavelength of about 118 nm. For missions requiring sensitivity below this cut-off,
we are planning an open version. We employ a coplanar cross-strip anode and advanced low-power readout
electronics with a 128-channel charge-amplifier chip. This publication focuses on the progress
concerning the main development challenges: the optimization of the photocathode parameters
and the sophisticated detector electronics.

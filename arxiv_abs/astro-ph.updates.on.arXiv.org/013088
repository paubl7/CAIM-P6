This study is the first of a series of papers that provide a technique to analyse the mixed-modes frequency
spectra and characterise the structure of stars on the subgiant and red-giant branches. We define
seismic indicators, relevant of the stellar structure and study their evolution on a grid of models.
The proposed method, EGGMiMoSA, relies on the asymptotic description of mixed modes, defines initial
guesses for the parameters, and uses a Levenberg-Marquardt technique to adjust the mixed-modes
pattern efficiently. We follow the evolution of the mixed-modes parameters along a grid of models
from the subgiant phase to the RGB bump and extend past works. We show the impact of the mass and composition
on their evolution. The evolution of the period spacing $\Delta\pi_1$, pressure offset $\epsilon_p$,
gravity offset $\epsilon_g$, and coupling factor $q$ as a function of $\Delta\nu$ is little affected
by the chemical composition and it follows two different regimes depending on the evolutionary
stage. On the subgiant branch, the models display a moderate core-envelope density contrast. The
evolution of $\Delta \pi_1$, $\epsilon_p$, $\epsilon_g$, and $q$ thus significantly changes
with the mass. Also, we demonstrate that, at fixed Z/X and with proper measurements of $\Delta\pi_1$
and $\Delta\nu$, we may unambiguously constrain the mass, radius and age of a subgiant star. Conversely,
on the red-giant branch, the core-envelope density contrast becomes very large. Consequently,
the evolution of $\epsilon_p$, $\epsilon_g$ and $q$ as a function of $\Delta\nu$ becomes independent
of the mass. This is also true for $\Delta \pi_1$ in stars with masses $\lesssim 1.8M_\odot$ because
of core electron degeneracy. This degeneracy is lifted for higher masses, again allowing for a precise
measurement of the age. Overall, our computations qualitatively agree with past observed and theoretical
studies.

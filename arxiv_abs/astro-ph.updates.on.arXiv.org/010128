Apsidal motion in massive eccentric binaries offers precious information about the internal structure
of the stars. This is especially true for twin binaries consisting of two nearly identical stars.
We make use of the tidally induced apsidal motion in the twin binary HD152248 to infer constraints
on the internal structure of the O7.5 III-II stars composing this system. We build stellar evolution
models with the code Cl\'es assuming different prescriptions for the internal mixing occurring
inside the stars. We identify the models that best reproduce the observationally determined present-day
properties of the components of HD152248, as well as their $k_2$, and the apsidal motion rate of the
system. We analyse the impact of some poorly constrained input parameters, including overshooting,
turbulent diffusion, and metallicity. We further build 'single' and 'binary' GENEC models that
account for stellar rotation to investigate the impacts of binarity and rotation. We discuss some
effects that could bias our interpretation of the apsidal motion in terms of the internal structure
constant. Reproducing the observed $k_2$ value and rate of apsidal motion simultaneously with
the other stellar parameters requires a significant amount of internal mixing or enhanced mass-loss.
The results suggest that a single-star evolution model is sufficient to describe the physics inside
this binary system. Qualitatively, the high turbulent diffusion required to reproduce the observations
could be partly attributed to stellar rotation. Higher-order terms in the apsidal motion are negligible.
Only a very severe misalignment of the rotation axes could significantly impact the rate of apsidal
motion, but such a high misalignment is highly unlikely in such a binary system. We infer an age estimate
of $5.15\pm0.13$ Myr for the binary and initial masses of $32.8\pm0.6$ M$_\odot$ for both stars.

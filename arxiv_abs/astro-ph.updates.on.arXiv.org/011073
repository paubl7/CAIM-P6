The software MAVKA is described, which was elaborated for statistically optimal determination
of the characteristics of the extrema of 1000+ variable stars of different types, mainly eclipsing
and pulsating. The approximations are phenomenological, but not physical. As often, the discovery
of a new variable star is made on time series of a single-filter (single-channel) data, and there
is no possibility to determine parameters needed for physical modelling (e.g. temperature, radial
velocities, mass ratio of binaries). Besides classical polynomial approximation "AP" (we limited
the degree of the polynomial from 2 to 9), there are realized symmetrical approximations (symmetrical
polynomials "SP", "wall-supported" horizontal line "WSL" and parabola "WSP", restricted polynomials
of non-integer order based on approximations of the functions proposed by Andronov (2012) and Mikulasek
(2015) and generally asymmetric functions (asymptotic parabola "AP", parabolic spline "PS",
generalized hyperbolic secant function "SECH" and "log-normal-like" "BSK"). This software is
a successor of the "Observation Obscurer" with some features for the variable star research, including
a block for "running parabola" "RP" scalegram and approximation. Whereas the RP is oriented on approximation
of the complete data set. MAVKA is pointed to parts of the light curve close to extrema (including
total eclipses and transits of stars and exoplanets). The functions for wider intervals, covering
the eclipse totally, were discussed in 2017Ap.....60...57A . Global and local approximations
are reviewed in 2020kdbd.book..191A . The software is available at this http URL and https://katerynaandrych.wixsite.com/mavka.
We have analyzed the data from own observations, as well as from monitoring obtained at ground-based
and space (currently, mainly, TESS) observatories. It may be used for signals of any nature.

We present the analysis of the microlensing event KMT-2018-BLG-1743. The light curve of the event,
with a peak magnification $A_{\rm peak}\sim 800$, exhibits two anomaly features, one around the
peak and the other on the falling side of the light curve. An interpretation with a binary lens and
a single source (2L1S) cannot describe the anomalies. By conducting additional modeling that includes
an extra lens (3L1S) or an extra source (2L2S) relative to a 2L1S interpretation, we find that 2L2S
interpretations with a planetary lens system and a binary source best explain the observed light
curve with $\Delta\chi^2\sim 188$ and $\sim 91$ over the 2L1S and 3L1S solutions, respectively.
Assuming that these $\Delta\chi^2$ values are adequate for distinguishing the models, the event
is the fourth 2L2S event and the second 2L2S planetary event. The 2L2S interpretations are subject
to a degeneracy, resulting in two solutions with $s>1.0$ (wide solution) and $s<1.0$ (close solution).
The masses of the lens components and the distance to the lens are $(M_{\rm host}/M_\odot, M_{\rm
planet}/M_{\rm J}, D_{\rm L}/{\rm kpc}) \sim (0.19^{+0.27}_{-0.111}, 0.25^{+0.34}_{-0.14},
6.48^{+0.94}_{-1.03})$ and $\sim (0.42^{+0.34}_{-0.25}, 1.61^{+1.30}_{-0.97}, 6.04^{+0.93}_{-1.27})$
according to the wide and close solutions, respectively. The source is a binary composed of an early
G dwarf and a mid M dwarf. The values of the relative lens-source proper motion expected from the two
degenerate solutions, $\mu_{\rm wide}\sim 2.3 $mas yr$^{-1}$ and $\mu_{\rm close} \sim 4.1 $mas
yr$^{-1}$, are substantially different, and thus the degeneracy can be broken by resolving the
lens and source from future high-resolution imaging observations.

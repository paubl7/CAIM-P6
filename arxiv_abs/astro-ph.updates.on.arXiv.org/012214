We present a kinematic study of ionised extraplanar gas in two low-inclination late-type galaxies
(NGC 3982 and NGC 4152) using integral field spectroscopy data from the DiskMass H$\alpha$ sample.
We first isolate the extraplanar gas emission by masking the H$\alpha$ flux from the regularly rotating
disc. The extraplanar gas emission is then modelled in the three-dimensional position-velocity
domain using a parametric model described by three structural and four kinematic parameters. Best-fit
values for the model are determined via a Bayesian MCMC approach. The reliability and accuracy of
our modelling method are carefully determined via tests using mock data. We detect ionised extraplanar
gas in both galaxies, with scale heights $0.83^{+0.27}_{-0.40}\,\mathrm{kpc}$ (NGC 3982) and
$1.87^{+0.43}_{-0.56}\,\mathrm{kpc}$ (NGC 4152) and flux fraction between the extraplanar
gas and the regularly rotating gas within the disc of 27% and 15% respectively, consistent with previous
determinations in other systems. We find lagging rotation of the ionized extraplanar gas in both
galaxies, with vertical rotational gradients $-22.24^{+6.60}_{-13.13} \,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}}$
and $-11.18^{+3.49}_{-4.06}\,\mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,kpc^{-1}}$, respectively, and weak evidence
for vertical and radial inflow in both galaxies. The above results are similar to the kinematics
of the neutral extraplanar gas found in several galaxies, though this is the first time that 3D kinematic
modelling of ionised extraplanar gas has been carried out. Our results are broadly consistent with
a galactic fountain origin combined with gas accretion. However, a dynamical model is required
to better understand the formation of ionised extraplanar gas.

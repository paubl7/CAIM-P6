We introduce the first result of the Clusters Hiding in Plain Sight (CHiPS) survey, which aims to
discover new, nearby, and massive galaxy clusters that were incorrectly identified as isolated
point sources in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey. We present a Chandra X-ray observation of our first newly
discovered low-redshift (z = 0.223) galaxy cluster with a central X-ray bright point source, PKS1353-341.
After removing the point source contribution to the cluster core (L_nuc ~ 1.8x10^44 erg/s), we determine
various properties of the cluster. The presence of a relaxed X-ray morphology, a central temperature
drop, and a central cooling time around 400 Myr indicates that it is a strong cool-core cluster. The
central galaxy appears to be forming stars at the rate of 6.2+\-3.6 Msun/yr, corresponding to ~1%
of the classical cooling prediction. The supermassive black hole in the central galaxy appear to
be accreting at ~0.1% of the Eddington rate with a total power output of ~5x10^45 erg/s, split nearly
equally between radiative and mechanical power. We see weak evidence of localized excess entropy
at a radius of 200 kpc which, if true, could imply a recent (~180 Myr) energetic outburst in the core
that has risen buoyantly to a larger radius. Comparing the cluster's bulk properties with those
of other known clusters (e.g., the total mass M_500 is 6.9(+4.3)(-2.6)x10^14 Msun, and the bolometric
X-ray luminosity L_X is 7x10^44 erg/s), we show that this cluster, which is massive enough that it
was detected (but not confirmed) by the Planck survey, is also sufficiently luminous that it would
have been identified as a cluster in the ROSAT All-sky Survey if it did not have such a bright central
point source. This discovery demonstrates the potential of the CHiPS survey to find massive nearby
clusters with extreme central properties that may have been missed or misidentified by previous
surveys.

A lower bound on unbiased estimates of wavefront errors (WFE) is presented for the linear regime
of small perturbation and active control of a high-contrast region (dark hole). Analytical approximations
and algorithms for computing the closed-loop covariance of the WFE modes are provided for discrete-
and continuous-time linear WFE dynamics. Our analysis applies to both image-plane and non-common-path
wavefront sensing (WFS) with Poisson-distributed measurements and noise sources (i.e., photon-counting
mode). Under this assumption, we show that recursive estimation benefits from infinitesimally
short exposure times, is more accurate than batch estimation and, for high-order WFE drift dynamical
processes, scales better than batch estimation with amplitude and star brightness. These newly-derived
contrast scaling laws are a generalization of previously known theoretical and numerical results
for turbulence-driven Adaptive Optics. For space-based coronagraphs, we propose a scheme for
combining models of WFE drift, low-order non-common-path WFS (LOWFS) and high-order image-plane
WFS (HOWFS) into closed-loop contrast estimates. We also analyze the impact of residual low-order
WFE, sensor noise, and other sources incoherent with the star, on closed-loop dark-hole maintenance
and the resulting contrast. As an application example, our model suggests that the Roman Space Telescope
might operate in a regime that is dominated by incoherent sources rather than WFE drift, where the
WFE drift can be actively rejected throughout the observations with residuals significantly dimmer
than the incoherent sources. The models proposed in this paper make possible the assessment of the
closed-loop contrast of coronagraphs with combined LOWFS and HOWFS capabilities, and thus help
estimate WFE stability requirements of future instruments.

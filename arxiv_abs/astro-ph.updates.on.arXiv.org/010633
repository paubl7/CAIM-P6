The solar radiation in the Lyman-alpha spectral line of hydrogen plays a significant role in the
illumination of chromospheric and coronal structures, such as prominences, spicules, chromospheric
fibrils, cores of coronal mass ejections, and solar wind. Moreover, it is important for the investigation
of the heliosphere, Earth's ionosphere, and the atmospheres of planets, moons, and comets. We derive
a reference quiet-Sun Lyman-alpha spectral profile that is representative of the Lyman-alpha
radiation from the solar disk during a minimum of solar activity. This profile can serve as an incident
radiation boundary condition for the radiative transfer modelling of chromospheric and coronal
structures. Because the solar radiation in the Lyman lines is not constant over time but varies significantly
with the solar cycle, we provide a method for the adaptation of the incident radiation Lyman line
profiles (Lyman-alpha and higher lines) to a specific date. Moreover, we analyse how the change
in the incident radiation influences the synthetic spectra produced by the radiative transfer
modelling. To take into account the Lyman-alpha variation with the solar cycle, we used the LISIRD
composite Lyman-alpha$ index. To estimate the influence of the change in the incident radiation
in the Lyman lines on the results of radiative transfer models, we used a 2D prominence fine structure
model. The analysis of the influence of the change in the incident radiation shows that the synthetic
spectra are strongly affected by the modification of the incident radiation boundary condition.
The hydrogen H alpha line can also be considerably affected, despite the fact that the H alpha radiation
from the solar disk does not vary with the solar cycle.

The present epoch of accelerated cosmic expansion is supposed to be driven by an unknown constituent
called dark energy, which in the standard model takes the form of a cosmological constant, characterized
by a constant equation of state with $w=-1$. An interesting perspective over the role and nature
of dark energy can be achieved by drawing a parallel with a previous epoch of accelerated expansion,
inflation, which we assume to be driven by a single scalar field, the inflaton. Since the Planck satellite
has constrained the value of the scalar spectral index $n_s$ away from 1, the inflaton cannot be identified
with a pure cosmological constant, as is also suggested by the fact that inflation ended. Thus, it
is interesting to verify whether a hypothetical observer would have been able to measure the deviation
of the equation of state parameter of the inflaton from $-1$. In this study, we analyze this question
by considering three single-field slow-roll inflationary models that we call HSR$\{2\}$, HSR$\{3\}$
and HSR$\{4\}$, where the hierarchy of Hubble slow-roll parameters is truncated to second, third
and fourth order respectively. The models are tested through a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis
based on combinations of the latest Planck and BICEP2/Keck data sets, and the resulting chains are
converted into sets of allowed evolution histories of $w$. This analysis yields a 68$\%$ upper bound
of $1+w < 0.0014$ for HSR$\{3\}$, which provides the overall best description for the data. Therefore,
if the current era of accelerated expansion happens to have the same equation of state as inflation
during the observable epoch, then current and upcoming cosmological observations will not be able
to detect that $w \neq -1$. This provides a cautionary tale for drawing conclusions about the nature
of dark energy on the basis of the non-observation of a deviation from $w=-1$.

Six binary-merger progenitors of Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A), whose properties are close to those
of the blue supergiant Sanduleak -69 202, are exploded by neutrino heating in three-dimensions
(3D), and light-curve calculations are performed in spherical symmetry, starting long after shock
breakout. Our results confirm basic findings of previous works using single-star progenitors:
(1) 3D neutrino-driven explosions with SN 1987A-like energies synthesize an amount of Ni-56 that
is consistent with the radioactive tail of the light curve; (2) hydrodynamic models mix hydrogen
inward to minimum velocities below 40 km/s as required by spectral observations of SN 1987A; and
(3) for given explosion energy the efficiency of outward radioactive Ni-56 mixing depends mainly
on high growth factors of Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities at the (C+O)/He and He/H composition interfaces
and a weak interaction of fast plumes with the reverse shock occurring below the He/H interface.
All binary-merger models possess presupernova radii consistent with the photometric radius of
Sanduleak -69 202 and a structure of the outer layers allowing them to reproduce the observed initial
luminosity peak in the first about 7 days. The light curve shape of models that mix about 0.5 Msun of
hydrogen into the helium shell and that exhibit strong outward mixing of Ni-56 with maximum velocities
exceeding the 3000 km/s observed for the bulk of ejected Ni-56 is in very good agreement with the dome
of the SN 1987A light curve. A comparative analysis of light-curve models of SN 1987A based on 3D neutrino-driven
explosions of single-star and binary-merger progenitors shows that only one binary model matches
all observational constraints with one exception.

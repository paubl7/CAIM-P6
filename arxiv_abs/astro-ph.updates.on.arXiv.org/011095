Ultra Fast Outflows (UFOs) are an established feature in X-ray spectra of AGNs. According to the
standard picture, they are launched at accretion disc scales with relativistic velocities, up
to 0.3-0.4 c. Their high kinetic power is enough to induce an efficient feedback on galactic-scale,
possibly contributing to the co-evolution between the central supermassive black hole (SMBH)
and the host galaxy. It is therefore of paramount importance to fully understand the UFO physics,
in particular the forces driving their acceleration and the relation with the accretion flow they
originate from. In this paper we investigate the impact of special relativity effects on the radiative
pressure exerted onto the outflow. The radiation received by the wind decreases for increasing
outflow velocity v, implying that the standard Eddington limit argument has to be corrected according
to v. Due to the limited ability of the radiation to counteract the SMBH gravity, we expect to find
lower typical velocities with respect to the non-relativistic scenario. We integrate the relativistic-corrected
outflow equation of motion for a realistic set of starting conditions. We concentrate on UFO typical
values of ionisation, column density and launching radius. We explore a one-dimensional, spherical
geometry and a 3D setting with a rotating thin accretion disc. We find that the inclusion of relativistic
effects leads to sizeable differences in the wind dynamics and that v is reduced up to 50% with respect
to the non-relativistic treatment. We compare our results with a sample of UFO from the literature,
and we find that the relativistic-corrected velocities are systematically lower than the reported
ones, indicating the need for an additional mechanism, such as magnetic driving, to explain the
highest velocity components. These conclusions, derived for AGN winds, have a general applicability.

We present an in-depth characterization of the polarimetric channel of the Large-Angle Spectrometric
COronagraph/LASCO-C3 onboard SOHO. The polarimetric analysis of the white-light images makes
use of polarized sequences composed of three images obtained through three polarizers oriented
at +60$^\circ$, 0$^\circ$, and -60$^\circ$, complemented by a neighboring unpolarized image.
However, the degradation of the 0$^\circ$ polarizer noticed in 1999 compelled us to reconstruct
the corresponding images from the other ones thereafter. The analysis closely follows the method
developed for LASCO-C2 (Lamy, et al. Solar Physics 295, 89, 2020 and arXiv:2001.05925) and implements
the formalism of Mueller, albeit with additional difficulties notably the presence of a non-axially
symmetric component of stray light. Critical corrections were derived from a SOHO roll sequence
and from consistency criteria (e.g., the tangential direction of polarization). The quasi-uninterrupted
photopolarimetric analysis of the outer corona over two complete Solar Cycles 23 and 24 was successfully
achieved and our final results encompass the characterization of its polarization, of its polarized
radiance, of the two-dimensional electron density, and of the K-corona. Comparison between the
C3 and C2 results where their field of view overlaps shows an overall agreement. The C3 results are
further in agreement with those of eclipses and radio ranging measurements to an elongation of about
10 solar radii but tend to diverge further out. Whereas the coronal polarization out to 20 solar radii
is still highly correlated with the temporal variation of the total magnetic field, this divergence
probably results from the increasing polarization of the F-corona.

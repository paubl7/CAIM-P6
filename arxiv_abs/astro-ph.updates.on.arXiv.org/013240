Solar Orbiter strives to unveil how the Sun controls and shapes the heliosphere and fills it with
energetic particle radiation. To this end, its Energetic Particle Detector (EPD) has now been in
operation, providing excellent data, for just over a year. EPD measures suprathermal and energetic
particles in the energy range from a few keV up to (near-) relativistic energies (few MeV for electrons
and about 500 MeV/nuc for ions). We present an overview of the initial results from the first year
of operations and we provide a first assessment of issues and limitations. During this first year
of operations of the Solar Orbiter mission, EPD has recorded several particle events at distances
between 0.5 and 1 au from the Sun. We present dynamic and time-averaged energy spectra for ions that
were measured with a combination of all four EPD sensors, namely: the SupraThermal Electron and
Proton sensor (STEP), the Electron Proton Telescope (EPT), the Suprathermal Ion Spectrograph
(SIS), and the High-Energy Telescope (HET) as well as the associated energy spectra for electrons
measured with STEP and EPT. We illustrate the capabilities of the EPD suite using the 10-11 December
2020 solar particle event. This event showed an enrichment of heavy ions as well as $^3$He, for which
we also present dynamic spectra measured with SIS. The high anisotropy of electrons at the onset
of the event and its temporal evolution is also shown using data from these sensors. We discuss the
ongoing in-flight calibration and a few open instrumental issues using data from the 21 July and
the 10-11 December 2020 events and give guidelines and examples for the usage of the EPD data. We explain
how spacecraft operations may affect EPD data and we present a list of such time periods in the appendix.
A list of the most significant particle enhancements as observed by EPT during this first year is
also provided.

We present the identification of the previously unnoticed physical association between the Corona
Australis molecular cloud (CrA), traced by interstellar dust emission, and two shell-like structures
observed with line emission of atomic hydrogen (HI) at 21 cm. Although the existence of the two shells
had already been reported in the literature, the physical link between the HI emission and CrA was
never highlighted before. We use both Planck and Herschel data to trace dust emission and the Galactic
All Sky HI Survey (GASS) to trace HI. The physical association between CrA and the shells is assessed
based both on spectroscopic observations of molecular and atomic gas and on dust extinction data
with Gaia. The shells are located at a distance between 140 and 190 pc, comparable to the distance
of CrA, which we derive as 150.5 +- 6.3 pc. We also employ dust polarization observations from Planck
to trace the magnetic-field structure of the shells. Both of them show patterns of magnetic-field
lines following the edge of the shells consistently with the magnetic-field morphology of CrA.
We estimate the magnetic-field strength at the intersection of the two shells via the Davis-Chandrasekhar-Fermi
(DCF) method. Albeit the many caveats that are behind the DCF method, we find a magnetic-field strength
of 27 +- 8 $\mu$G, at least a factor of two larger than the magnetic-field strength computed off of
the HI shells. This value is also significantly larger compared to the typical values of a few $\mu$G
found in the diffuse HI gas from Zeeman splitting. We interpret this as the result of magnetic-field
compression caused by the shell expansion. This study supports a scenario of molecular-cloud formation
triggered by supersonic compression of cold magnetized HI gas from expanding interstellar bubbles.

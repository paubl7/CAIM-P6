It is now clear that a significant population of accreting black holes are undetected by commonly
employed optical, mid-infrared color, X-ray, and radio selection methods due to obscuration or
contamination of the emission from the nuclear region caused by star formation in the host galaxy.
These elusive active galactic nuclei (AGNs) are an important component of the AGN population. They
are often found in mergers, where significant black hole growth likely takes place, and in the lowest
mass galaxies or galaxies that lack classical bulges, a demographic that places important constraints
on models of supermassive black hole seed formation and merger-free models of AGN fueling. In this
work, we demonstrate the power of James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in uncovering and characterizing
these elusive AGNs. We present an integrated modeling approach in which both the line and emergent
continuum is predicted from gas exposed to the ionizing radiation from a young starburst and an AGN,
focusing specifically on the spectral diagnostics available through JWST, and provide predictions
on the detectability of key diagnostic lines by the NIRSpec and MIRI spectrometers, assuming typical
conditions for the gas. We demonstrate the crucial need for JWST in uncovering low level accretion
activity even in nearby galaxies and out to redshifts of ~ 1 - 3, depending on the ionization parameter,
and gas phase metallicity. We present a redshift-dependent selection strategy that can be used
to identify promising elusive AGN candidates for future follow-up study. The full suite of simulations
are available online, where users can select specific parameters and retrieve the predicted continuum
and infrared line luminosities from our models.

We present the updated census and statistics of Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting long gamma-ray bursts
host galaxies (LAE-LGRBs). We investigate the properties of a sub-sample of LAE-LGRBs and test
the shell model commonly used to fit Lyman-$\alpha$ (Ly$\alpha$) emission line spectra. Among
the LAE-LGRBs detected to date, we select a golden sample of four LAE-LGRBs allowing us to retrieve
information on the host galaxy properties and of its interstellar medium gas. We fit their Ly$\alpha$
spectra using the shell model, and constrain its parameters with the observed values. From the comparison
of the statistics and properties of LAE-LGRBs to those of LAE samples in the literature, we find evidences
of Ly$\alpha$ suppression in dusty systems, and a fraction of LAE-LGRBs among the overall LGRB hosts
lower than that found for Lyman-break galaxy (LBG) samples at similar redshift range. However,
we find that LAE-LGRBs are representative of Ly$\alpha$ emission from the bulk of UV-selected galaxies
at z~2. We find that the golden sample of LAE-LGRBs are complex systems characterized by multiple
emission blobs and by signs of possible galaxy interactions. The fitting procedure fails in recovering
the HI column densities (NHI) measured from the afterglow spectra, and the other properties described
by the shell-model parameters in the cases with very high NHI. The afterglows of most LGRBs and LAE-LGRBs
show high NHI, implying that statistically the bulk of Ly$\alpha$ photons expected to be produced
by massive stars in the star-forming region hosting the GRB will be surrounded by such opaque lines
of sight. We interpret our results in the context of more sophisticated models and of different dominant
Ly$\alpha$ emitting regions. We also compare LAE-LGRBs to LAE Lyman continuum (LyC) leakers in
the literature in terms of properties identified as possible indirect indicators of LyC leakage.

When a subhalo interacts with a cold stellar stream it perturbs its otherwise nearly smooth distribution
of stars, and this leads to the creation of a gap. The properties of such gaps depend on the parameters
of the interaction. Their characterisation could thus lead to the determination of the mass spectrum
of the perturbers and possibly reveal the existence of dark subhalos orbiting the Milky Way. Our
goal is to construct a fully analytical model of the formation and evolution of gaps embedded in streams
orbiting in a realistic Milky Way potential. To this end, we extend the model of Helmi & Koppelman
(2016) for spherical potentials, and predict the properties of gaps in streams evolving in axisymmetric
St\"ackel potentials. We make use of action-angles and their simple behaviour to calculate the
divergence of initially nearby orbits slightly perturbed by the interaction with a subhalo. Our
model, corroborated by N-body experiments, predicts that the size of a gap grows linearly with time.
We obtain analytical expressions for the dependencies of the growth rate on the orbit of the stream,
the properties of the subhalo (mass, scale-radius), and the geometry of the encounter (relative
velocity, impact parameter). We find that the density at the centre of the gap decreases with time
as a power-law in the same way as the density of a stream. This results in the density-contrast between
a pristine and a perturbed stream on the same orbit asymptotically reaching a constant value dependent
only on the encounter parameters. We find that at a fixed age, smallish gaps are sensitive mostly
to the mass of the subhalo, while gaps formed by subhalo flybys with a low relative velocity, or when
the stream and subhalo move parallel, are degenerate to the encounter parameters.

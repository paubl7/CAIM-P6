Silicon immersion gratings and grisms enable compact, near-infrared spectrographs with high
throughput. These instruments find use in ground-based efforts to characterize stellar and exoplanet
atmospheres, and in space-based observatories. Our grating fabrication technique uses x-ray
crystallography to orient silicon parts prior to cutting, followed by lithography and wet chemical
etching to produce the blaze. This process takes advantage of the crystal structure and relative
difference in etching rates between the (100) and (111) planes such that we can produce parts that
have surface errors < {\lambda}/4. Previous measurements indicate that chemical etching can yield
a final etched blaze that slightly differs from the orientation of the (111) plane. This difference
can be corrected by the mechanical mount in the case of the immersion gratings, but doing so may compromise
grating throughput due to shadowing. In the case of the grisms, failure to take the actual blaze into
account will reduce the brightness of the undeviated ray. We report on multiple techniques to precisely
measure the blaze of our in-house fabricated immersion gratings. The first method uses a scanning
electron microscope to image the blaze profile, which yields a measurement precision of 0.5 degrees.
The second method is an optical method of measuring the angle between blaze faces using a rotation
stage, which yields a measurement precision of 0.2 degrees. Finally, we describe a theoretical
blaze function modeling method, which we expect to yield a measurement precision of 0.1 degrees.
With these methods, we can quantify the accuracy with which the wet etching produces the required
blaze and further optimize grating and grism efficiencies.

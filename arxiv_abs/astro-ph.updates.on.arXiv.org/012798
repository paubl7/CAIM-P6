Surface brightness-color relations (SBCRs) are used for estimating angular diameters and deriving
stellar properties. They are critical to derive extragalactic distances of early-type and late-type
eclipsing binaries or, potentially, for extracting planetary parameters of late-type stars hosting
planets. Various SBCRs have been implemented so far, but strong discrepancies in terms of precision
and accuracy still exist in the literature. We aim to develop a precise SBCR for early-type B and A
stars using selection criteria, based on stellar characteristics, and combined with homogeneous
interferometric angular diameter measurements. We also improve SBCRs for late-type stars, in
particular in the Gaia photometric band. We observed 18 early-type stars with the VEGA interferometric
instrument, installed on the CHARA array. We then applied additional criteria on the photometric
measurements, together with stellar characteristics diagnostics in order to build the SBCRs.
We calibrated a SBCR for subgiant and dwarf early-type stars. The RMS of the relation is $\sigma_{F_{V_{0}}}
= 0.0051\,$mag, leading to an average precision of 2.3% on the estimation of angular diameters,
with 3.1% for $V-K < -0.2\,$mag and 1.8% for $V-K > -0.2\,$mag. We found that the conversion between
Johnson-$K$ and 2MASS-$K_s$ photometries is a key issue for early-type stars. Following this result,
we have revisited our previous SBCRs for late-type stars by calibrating them with either converted
Johnson-$K$ or 2MASS-$K_s$ photometries. We also improve the calibration of these SBCRs based
on the Gaia photometry. The expected precision on the angular diameter using our SBCRs for late-type
stars ranges from 1.0% to 2.7%. By reaching a precision of 2.3% on the estimation of angular diameters
for early-type stars, significant progress has been made to determine extragalactic distances
using early-type eclipsing binaries.

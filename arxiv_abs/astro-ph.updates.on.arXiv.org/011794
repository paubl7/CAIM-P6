More than 10% of the barred galaxies with a direct measurement of the bar pattern speed host an ultrafast
bar. These bars extend beyond the corotation radius and challenge our understanding of the orbital
structure of barred galaxies. Most of them are found in spiral galaxies, rather than in lenticular
ones. We analysed the properties of the ultrafast bars detected in the CALIFA Survey to investigate
whether they are an artefact resulting from an overestimation of the bar radius and/or an underestimation
of the corotation radius or a new class of bars, whose orbital structure has not yet been understood.
We revised the available measurements of the bar radius based on ellipse fitting and Fourier analysis
and of the bar pattern speed from the Tremaine-Weinberg method. In addition, we measured the bar
radius from the analysis of the maps tracing the transverse-to-radial force ratio, which we obtained
from the deprojected i-band images of the galaxies retrieved from the SDSS Survey. We found that
nearly all the sample galaxies are spirals with an inner ring or pseudo-ring circling the bar and/or
strong spiral arms, which hamper the measurement of the bar radius from the ellipse fitting and Fourier
analysis. According to these methods, the bar ends overlap the ring or the spiral arms making the
adopted bar radius unreliable. On the contrary, the bar radius from the ratio maps are shorter than
the corotation radius. This is in agreement with the theoretical predictions and findings of numerical
simulations about the extension and stability of the stellar orbits supporting the bars. We conclude
that ultrafast bars are no longer observed when the correct measurement of the bar radius is adopted.
Deriving the bar radius in galaxies with rings and strong spiral arms is not straightforward and
a solid measurement method based on both photometric and kinematic data is still missing.

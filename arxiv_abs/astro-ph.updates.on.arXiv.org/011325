We explore the possibility of constraining model parameters of the Epoch of Reionization (EoR)
from 21cm brightness temperature maps, using a combination of morphological descriptors constructed
from the eigenvalues of the Contour Minkowski Tensor (CMT), Betti numbers (count of connected regions
$n_{con}$ and holes $n_{hole}$) and the area of structures in the excursion set of the field. We use
a three parameter model of EoR simulated using 21\textrm{cmFAST}, namely the ionizing efficiency
of sources $\zeta$, the minimum virial temperature $T_{vir}$ required for collapse into a halo
and the maximum radius for ionizing radiation described by $R_{mfp}$. We performed a Bayesian analysis
to recover model parameters for a mock 21cm image from SKA phase I at a redshift of $z=7.4$ corresponding
to a mean neutral hydrogen fraction of $\mathrm{\bar x}_{HI} \simeq 0.5$. We find that in the absence
of noise the average size of structures in the field with $x_{HI} \lesssim 0.5$ is smaller than regions
with $x_{HI} \gtrsim 0.5$ and the structures are equally isotropic when $\mathrm{\bar x}_{HI}=0.5$
. We also find that in order to recover the input model to within $1-\sigma$ accuracy for a mock noisy
image at a single frequency channel of $1~\mathrm{MHz}$, for an observation time $t_{obs}<2000~\mathrm{hrs}$,
the noisy $\delta T_b$ map needs to be smoothed at a scale $R_s>9.5~\mathrm{Mpc}$. Finally we show
that the systematic behaviour of the statistic as ionization progresses, enables us to obtain stringent
constraints on $\mathrm{\bar x}_{HI}$ (with a coefficient of variation $\sim 0.05$ as compared
to $\sim 0.1-0.2$ for model parameter constraints), thereby making these descriptors a promising
statistic for constraining EoR model parameters.

Outflows driven by active galactic nuclei (AGN) are expected to have a significant impact on the
host galaxy evolution, but it is still debated how they are accelerated and propagate on galaxy-wide
scales. This work addresses these questions by studying the link between X-ray, nuclear ultra-fast
outflows (UFOs) and extended ionised outflows, for the first time in two quasars close to the peak
of AGN activity ($z\sim2$), where AGN feedback is expected to be more effective. As targets, we selected
two multiple-lensed quasars at $z\sim1.5$, HS 0810+2554 and SDSS J1353+1138, known to host UFOs
and observed with the near-IR integral field spectrometer SINFONI at the VLT. We performed a kinematical
analysis of the [O III]$\lambda$5007 optical emission line, in order to trace the presence of ionised
outflows. We detected spatially resolved ionised outflows in both galaxies, extended more than
8 kpc and moving up to $v>2000$ km/s. We derived mass outflow rates of $\sim$12 M$_{sun}$/yr and $\sim$2
M$_{sun}$/yr for HS 0810+2554 and SDSS J1353+1138. Comparing with the co-hosted UFO energetics,
the ionised outflow energetics in HS 0810+2554 is broadly consistent with a momentum-driven regime
of wind propagation, while in SDSS J1353+1138 it differs by a factor of $\sim$100 from theoretical
predictions, requiring either a massive molecular outflow or a high variability of the AGN activity
to account for such a discrepancy. By additionally considering our results with those from the small
sample of well-studied objects (all local but one), with both UFO and extended (ionised/atomic/molecular)
outflow detections, we found that in 10 out of 12 galaxies the large-scale outflow energetics is
consistent with the theoretical predictions of either a momentum- or an energy-driven scenario.
This suggests that such models explain relatively well the acceleration mechanism of AGN-driven
winds on large scales.

Aims: Interstellar molecules form early in the evolutionary sequence of interstellar material
that eventually forms stars and planets. To understand this evolutionary sequence, it is important
to characterize the chemical composition of its first steps. Methods: In this paper, we present
the result of a 2 and 3 mm survey of five cold clumps identified by the Planck mission. We carried out
a radiative transfer analysis on the detected lines in order to put some constraints on the physical
conditions within the cores and on the molecular column densities. We also performed chemical models
to reproduce the observed abundances in each source using the gas-grain model Nautilus. Results:
Twelve molecules were detected: H2CO, CS, SO, NO, HNO, HCO+, HCN, HNC, CN, CCH, CH3OH, and CO. Here,
CCH is the only carbon chain we detected in two sources. Radiative transfer analyses of HCN, SO, CS,
and CO were performed to constrain the physical conditions of each cloud with limited success. The
sources have a density larger than $10^4$ cm$^{-3}$ and a temperature lower than 15 K. The derived
species column densities are not very sensitive to the uncertainties in the physical conditions,
within a factor of 2. The different sources seem to present significant chemical differences with
species abundances spreading over one order of magnitude. The chemical composition of these clumps
is poorer than the one of Taurus Molecular Cloud 1 Cyanopolyyne Peak (TMC-1 CP) cold core. Our chemical
model reproduces the observational abundances and upper limits for 79 to 83\% of the species in our
sources. The "best" times for our sources seem to be smaller than those of TMC-1, indicating that
our sources may be less evolved and explaining the smaller abundances and the numerous non-detections.
Also, CS and HCN are always overestimated by our models.

Context. Classical T Tauri stars (cTTs) are pre-main sequence stars surrounded by an accretion
disk. They host a strong magnetic field, and both magnetospheric accretion and ejection processes
develop as the young magnetic star interacts with its disk. Studying this interaction is a major
goal toward understanding the properties of young stars and their evolution. Aims. The goal of this
study is to investigate the accretion process in the young stellar system HQ Tau, an intermediate-mass
T Tauri star (1.9 M$_{\odot}$). Methods. The time variability of the system is investigated both
photometrically, using Kepler-K2 and complementary light curves, and from a high-resolution
spectropolarimetric time series obtained with ESPaDOnS at CFHT. Results. The quasi-sinusoidal
Kepler-K2 light curve exhibits a period of 2.424 d, which we ascribe to the rotational period of the
star. The radial velocity of the system shows the same periodicity, as expected from the modulation
of the photospheric line profiles by surface spots. A similar period is found in the red wing of several
emission lines (e.g., HI, CaII, NaI), due to the appearance of inverse P Cygni components, indicative
of accretion funnel flows. Signatures of outflows are also seen in the line profiles, some being
periodic, others transient. The polarimetric analysis indicates a complex, moderately strong
magnetic field which is possibly sufficient to truncate the inner disk close to the corotation radius,
r$_{cor}$ $\sim$3.5 R$_{\star}$. Additionally, we report HQ Tau to be a spectroscopic binary candidate
whose orbit remains to be determined. Conclusions. The results of this study expand upon those previously
reported for low-mass T Tauri stars, as they indicate that the magnetospheric accretion process
may still operate in intermediate-mass pre-main sequence stars, such as HQ Tau.

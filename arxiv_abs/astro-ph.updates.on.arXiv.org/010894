Classical novae result from thermonuclear explosions producing several $\gamma$-ray emitters
which are prime targets for satellites observing in the MeV range. The early 511 keV gamma-ray emission
depends critically on the $^{18}$F(p,$\alpha$)$^{15}$O reaction rate which, despite many experimental
and theoretical efforts, still remains uncertain. One of the main uncertainties in the $^{18}$F(p,$\alpha$)$^{15}$O
reaction rate is the contribution in the Gamow window of interference between sub-threshold $^{19}$Ne
states and known broad states at higher energies. Therefore the goal of this work is to clarify the
existence and the nature of these sub-threshold states. States in the $^{19}$Ne compound nucleus
were studied at the Tandem-ALTO facility using the $^{19}$F($^3$He,t)$^{19}$Ne charge exchange
reaction. Tritons were detected with an Enge Split-pole spectrometer while decaying protons or
$\alpha$-particles from unbound $^{19}$Ne states were collected, in coincidence, with a double-sided
silicon strip detector array. Angular correlations were extracted and constraints on the spin
and parity of decaying states established. The coincidence yield at $E_x$ = 6.29 MeV was observed
to be high spin, supporting the conclusion that it is indeed a doublet consisting of high spin and
low spin components. Evidence for a broad, low spin state was observed around 6 MeV. Branching ratios
were extracted for several states above the proton threshold and were found to be consistent with
the literature. R-matrix calculations show the relative contribution of sub-threshold states
to the astrophysically important energy region above the proton threshold. The levels schemes
of $^{19}$Ne and $^{19}$F are still not sufficiently well known and further studies of the analogue
assignments are needed. The tentative broad state at 6 MeV may only play a role if the reduced proton
width is large.

The Event Horizon Telescope recently produced the first images of a black hole. These images were
synthesized by measuring the coherent correlation function of the complex electric field measured
at telescopes located across the Earth. This correlation function corresponds to the Fourier transform
of the image under the assumption that the source emits spatially incoherent radiation. However,
black holes differ from standard astrophysical objects: in the absence of absorption and scattering,
an observer sees a series of increasingly demagnified echos of each emitting location. These echos
correspond to rays that orbit the black hole one or more times before reaching the observer. This
multi-path propagation introduces spatial and temporal correlations into the electric field
that encode properties of the black hole, irrespective of intrinsic variability. We explore the
coherent temporal autocorrelation function measured at a single telescope. Specifically, we
study the simplified toy problem of scalar field correlation functions $\langle \Psi(t) \Psi(0)
\rangle$ sourced by fluctuating matter located near a Schwarzschild black hole. We find that the
correlation function is peaked at times equal to integer multiples of the photon orbit period; the
corresponding power spectral density vanishes like $\lambda/r_{\rm g}$ where $r_{\rm g} = G M /
c^{2}$ is the gravitational radius of the black hole and $\lambda$ is the wavelength of radiation
observed. For supermassive black holes observed at millimeter wavelengths, the power in echos
is suppressed relative to direct emission by $\sim 10^{-13} \lambda_{\rm mm}/M_{6}$, where $\lambda_{\rm
mm} = \lambda/(1\,{\rm mm})$ and $M_6 = M/(10^6 M_\odot)$. Consequently, detecting multi-path
propagation near a black hole using the coherent electric field autocorrelation is infeasible
with current technology.

Atmospheric retrievals of exoplanetary transmission spectra provide important constraints
on various properties such as chemical abundances, cloud/haze properties, and characteristic
temperatures, at the day-night atmospheric terminator. To date, most spectra have been observed
for giant exoplanets due to which retrievals typically assume H-rich atmospheres. However, recent
observations of mini-Neptunes/super-Earths, and the promise of upcoming facilities including
JWST, call for a new generation of retrievals that can address a wide range of atmospheric compositions
and related complexities. Here we report Aurora, a next-generation atmospheric retrieval framework
that builds upon state-of-the-art architectures and incorporates the following key advancements:
a) a generalised compositional retrieval allowing for H-rich and H-poor atmospheres, b) a generalised
prescription for inhomogeneous clouds/hazes, c) multiple Bayesian inference algorithms for
high-dimensional retrievals, d) modular considerations for refraction, forward scattering,
and Mie-scattering, and e) noise modeling functionalities. We demonstrate Aurora on current and/or
synthetic observations of hot Jupiter HD209458b, mini-Neptune K218b, and rocky exoplanet TRAPPIST1d.
Using current HD209458b spectra, we demonstrate the robustness of our framework and cloud/haze
prescription against assumptions of H-rich/H-poor atmospheres, improving on previous treatments.
Using real and synthetic spectra of K218b, we demonstrate the agnostic approach to confidently
constrain its bulk atmospheric composition and obtain precise abundance estimates. For TRAPPIST1d,
10 JWST NIRSpec transits can enable identification of the main atmospheric component for cloud-free
CO$_2$-rich and N$_2$-rich atmospheres, and abundance constraints on trace gases including initial
indications of O$_3$ if present at enhanced levels ($\sim$10-100x Earth levels).

The first exploration of Pluto was motivated by (i) the many intriguing aspects of this body, its
atmosphere, and its giant impact binary-planet formation; as well as (ii) the scientific desire
to initiate the reconnaissance of the newly-discovered population of dwarf planets in the Kuiper
Belt. That exploration took place in the form of a single spacecraft flyby that yielded an impressive
array of exciting results that have transformed our understanding of this world and its satellites,
and which opened our eyes to the exciting nature of the dwarf planet population of the Kuiper Belt.
From Pluto's five-object satellite system, to its hydrocarbon haze-laden atmosphere, to its variegated
distribution of surface volatiles, to its wide array of geologic expressions that include extensive
glaciation and suspected cryovolcanoes, plus the tantalizing possibility of an interior ocean,
the Pluto system has proven to be as complex as larger terrestrial bodies like Mars, and it begs for
future exploration. Owing to Pluto's high obliquity (and consequently, current-epoch southern
hemisphere polar winter darkness) and the single spacecraft nature of the New Horizons flyby, only
about 40% of Pluto and its binary satellite, Charon, could be mapped at high pixel scales (better
than 10 km/pix). Additionally, due to their distances from New Horizons at closest approach, none
of Pluto's small moons could be studied at high resolution during the flyby. Furthermore, studies
of the time variability of atmospheric, geologic, and surface-atmosphere interactions cannot
be practically made by additional flybys, and they cannot be made from Earth-based observations.
We find that these limitations, combined with Pluto's many important, open scientific questions,
strongly motivate a Pluto System follow on orbiter mission.

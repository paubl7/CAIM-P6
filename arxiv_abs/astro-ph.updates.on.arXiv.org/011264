Observations of brown dwarfs (BDs), free-floating planetary-mass objects, and directly imaged
extrasolar giant planets (EGPs) exhibit rich evidence of large-scale weather. Cloud radiative
feedback has been proposed as a potential mechanism driving the vigorous atmospheric circulation
on BDs and directly imaged EGPs, and yet it has not been demonstrated in three-dimensional dynamical
models at relevant conditions. Here we present a series of atmospheric circulation models that
self-consistently coupled dynamics with idealized cloud formation and its radiative effects.
We demonstrate that vigorous atmospheric circulation can be triggered and self-maintained by
cloud radiative feedback. Typical isobaric temperature variation could reach over 100 K and horizontally
averaged wind speed could be several hundred m/s. The circulation is dominated by cloud-forming
and clear-sky vortices that evolve over timescales from several to tens of hours. The typical horizontal
lengthscale of dominant vortices is closed to the Rossby deformation radius, showing a linear dependence
on the inverse of rotation rate. Stronger rotation tends to weaken the vertical transport of vapor
and clouds, leading to overall thinner clouds. Domain-mean outgoing radiative flux exhibits variability
over timescales of tens of hours due to the statistical evolution of storms. Different bottom boundary
conditions in the models could lead to qualitatively different circulation near the observable
layer. The circulation driven by cloud radiative feedback represents a robust mechanism generating
significant surface inhomogeneity as well as irregular flux time variability. Our results have
important implications for near-IR colors of dusty BDs and EGPs, including the scatter in the near-IR
color-magnitude diagram and the viewing-geometry dependent near-IR colors.

The nearby dwarf galaxy NGC 3077 is known for its peculiar morphology, which includes numerous dust
lanes and emission-line regions. The interstellar medium in this galaxy is subject to several perturbing
factors. These are primarily the central starburst and tidal structures in the M 81 group. We present
a comprehensive study of the state of ionization, kinematics, and chemical composition of ionized
gas in NGC 3077, including both star-forming regions and diffuse ionized gas (DIG) at the periphery.
We study gas motions in the H$\alpha$ line via high-resolution ($R\approx15\,000$) 3D spectroscopy
with the scanning Fabry-Perot interferometer installed into SCORPIO-2 instrument attached to
the 6-m telescope of the SAO RAS. Images in the main optical emission lines were acquired with MaNGaL
photometer with a tunable filter at the 2.5-m telescope of the Caucasian Mountain Observatory of
SAI MSU. We also used SCORPIO-2 to perform long-slit spectroscopy of the galaxy with a resolution
of $R\approx1\,000$. Our estimate of the gas metallicity, $Z=0.6Z_\odot$, is significantly lower
than the earlier determination, but agrees with the "luminosity--metallicity" dependence. Spatially
resolved diagnostic diagrams of the emission-line ratios do not show correlations between the
gas ionization state and its velocity dispersion, and this is most likely due to strong ionization
by young stars, whereas the contribution of shocks to the excitation of emission lines is less important.
We also studied the locations of multicomponent H$\alpha$ profiles and provide arguments suggesting
that they are mostly associated with individual kinematic components along the line of sight and
not with expanding shells as it was believed earlier. We also observe there a combination of wind
outflow from star-forming regions and accretion from interstellar gas clouds in the M 81 group.

We present measurements of the $E$-mode ($EE$) polarization power spectrum and temperature-$E$-mode
($TE$) cross-power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background using data collected by SPT-3G,
the latest instrument installed on the South Pole Telescope. This analysis uses observations of
a 1500 deg$^2$ region at 95, 150, and 220 GHz taken over a four month period in 2018. We report binned
values of the $EE$ and $TE$ power spectra over the angular multipole range $300 \le \ell < 3000$, using
the multifrequency data to construct six semi-independent estimates of each power spectrum and
their minimum-variance combination. These measurements improve upon the previous results of
SPTpol across the multipole ranges $300 \le \ell \le 1400$ for $EE$ and $300 \le \ell \le 1700$ for
$TE$, resulting in constraints on cosmological parameters comparable to those from other current
leading ground-based experiments. We find that the SPT-3G dataset is well-fit by a $\Lambda$CDM
cosmological model with parameter constraints consistent with those from Planck and SPTpol data.
From SPT-3G data alone, we find $H_0 = 68.8 \pm 1.5 \mathrm{km\,s^{-1}\,Mpc^{-1}}$ and $\sigma_8
= 0.789 \pm 0.016$, with a gravitational lensing amplitude consistent with the $\Lambda$CDM prediction
($A_L = 0.98 \pm 0.12$). We combine the SPT-3G and the Planck datasets and obtain joint constraints
on the $\Lambda$CDM model. The volume of the 68% confidence region in six-dimensional $\Lambda$CDM
parameter space is reduced by a factor of 1.5 compared to Planck-only constraints, with only slight
shifts in central values. We note that the results presented here are obtained from data collected
during just half of a typical observing season with only part of the focal plane operable, and that
the active detector count has since nearly doubled for observations made with SPT-3G after 2018.

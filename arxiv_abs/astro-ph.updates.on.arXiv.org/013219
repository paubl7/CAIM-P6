The study of solar oscillations (helioseismology) has been a very successful method of researching
the Sun. Helioseismology teaches us about the structure and mean properties of the Sun. Together
with mid-resolution data, the local properties were uncovered in quiet-Sun regions. However,
magnetic fields affect the oscillations and prevent us from studying the properties of magnetically
active regions with helioseismology. We aim to create a new methodology to suppress the negative
effects of magnetic fields on solar oscillations and measure plasma properties close to active
regions. The methodology consists of new averaging geometries, a non-linear approach to travel-time
measurements, and a consistent inversion method that combines plasma flows and sound-speed perturbations.
We constructed the one-sided arc averaging geometries and applied them to the non-linear approach
of travel-time measurements. Using the one-sided arc travel times, we reconstructed the annulus
travel times in a quiet-Sun region. We tested the methodology against the validated helioseismic
inversion pipeline. We applied the new methodology for an inversion for surface horizontal flows
in a region with a circular H-type sunspot. The inverted surface horizontal flows are comparable
with the output of the coherent structure tracking, which is not strongly affected by the presence
of the magnetic field. We show that the new methodology suppresses the negative effects of magnetic
fields up to outer penumbra. We measure divergent flows with properties comparable to the moat flow.
The new methodology can teach us about the depth structure of active regions and physical conditions
that contribute to the evolution of the active regions.

The gravitational-wave signal GW190521 is consistent with a binary black hole merger source at
redshift 0.8 with unusually high component masses, $85^{+21}_{-14}\,M_{\odot}$ and $66^{+17}_{-18}\,M_{\odot}$,
compared to previously reported events, and shows mild evidence for spin-induced orbital precession.
The primary falls in the mass gap predicted by (pulsational) pair-instability supernova theory,
in the approximate range $65 - 120\,M_{\odot}$. The probability that at least one of the black holes
in GW190521 is in that range is 99.0%. The final mass of the merger $(142^{+28}_{-16}\,M_{\odot})$
classifies it as an intermediate-mass black hole. Under the assumption of a quasi-circular binary
black hole coalescence, we detail the physical properties of GW190521's source binary and its post-merger
remnant, including component masses and spin vectors. Three different waveform models, as well
as direct comparison to numerical solutions of general relativity, yield consistent estimates
of these properties. Tests of strong-field general relativity targeting the merger-ringdown
stages of coalescence indicate consistency of the observed signal with theoretical predictions.
We estimate the merger rate of similar systems to be $0.13^{+0.30}_{-0.11}\,{\rm Gpc}^{-3}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$.
We discuss the astrophysical implications of GW190521 for stellar collapse, and for the possible
formation of black holes in the pair-instability mass gap through various channels: via (multiple)
stellar coalescence, or via hierarchical merger of lower-mass black holes in star clusters or in
active galactic nuclei. We find it to be unlikely that GW190521 is a strongly lensed signal of a lower-mass
black hole binary merger. We also discuss more exotic possible sources for GW190521, including
a highly eccentric black hole binary, or a primordial black hole binary.

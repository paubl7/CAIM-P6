We present the first interferometric blind HI survey of the Fornax galaxy cluster, which covers
an area of 15 deg$^2$ out to the cluster $R_{vir}$. The survey has a resolution of 67''x95'' and 6.6
km$s^{-1}$ with a 3$\sigma$ sensitivity of N(HI)~2x10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$ and MHI 2x10$^7$ M$_\odot$.
We detect 16 galaxies out of 200 spectroscopically confirmed Fornax cluster members. The detections
cover ~3 orders of magnitude in HI mass, from 8x10$^6$ to 1.5x10$^{10}$ M$_\odot$. They avoid the
central, virialised region of the cluster both on the sky and in projected phase-space, showing
that they are recent arrivals and that, in Fornax, HI is lost within a crossing time, ~2 Gyr. Half of
these galaxies exhibit a disturbed HI morphology, including several cases of asymmetries, tails,
offsets between HI and optical centres, and a case of a truncated HI disc suggesting that they have
been interacting within or on their way to Fornax. Our HI detections are HI-poorer and form stars
at a lower rate than non-cluster galaxies in the same $M_\star$ range. Low mass galaxies are more
strongly affected throughout their infall towards the cluster. The MHI/$M_\star$ ratio of Fornax
galaxies is comparable to that in the Virgo cluster. At fixed $M_\star$, our HI detections follow
the non-cluster relation between MHI and the star formation rate, and we argue that this implies
that so far they have lost their HI on a timescale $\gtrsim$1-2 Gyr. Deeper inside the cluster HI removal
is likely to proceed faster, as confirmed by a population of HI-undetected but H$_2$-detected star-forming
galaxies. Based on ALMA data, we find a large scatter in H$_2$-to-HI mass ratio, with several galaxies
showing an unusually high ratio that is probably caused by faster HI removal. We identify an HI-rich
subgroup of possible interacting galaxies dominated by NGC 1365, where pre-processing is likey
to have taken place.

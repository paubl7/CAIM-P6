The COnstrain Dark Energy with X-ray clusters (CODEX) sample contains the largest flux limited
sample of X-ray clusters at $0.35 < z < 0.65$. It was selected from ROSAT data in the 10,000 square degrees
of overlap with BOSS, mapping a total number of 2770 high-z galaxy clusters. We present here the full
results of the CFHT CODEX program on cluster mass measurement, including a reanalysis of CFHTLS
Wide data, with 25 individual lensing-constrained cluster masses. We employ $lensfit$ shape measurement
and perform a conservative colour-space selection and weighting of background galaxies. Using
the combination of shape noise and an analytic covariance for intrinsic variations of cluster profiles
at fixed mass due to large scale structure, miscentring, and variations in concentration and ellipticity,
we determine the likelihood of the observed shear signal as a function of true mass for each cluster.
We combine 25 individual cluster mass likelihoods in a Bayesian hierarchical scheme with the inclusion
of optical and X-ray selection functions to derive constraints on the slope $\alpha$, normalization
$\beta$, and scatter $\sigma_{\ln \lambda | \mu}$ of our richness-mass scaling relation model
in log-space: $\left<\ln \lambda | \mu \right> = \alpha \mu + \beta$, with $\mu = \ln (M_{200c}/M_{\mathrm{piv}})$,
and $M_{\mathrm{piv}} = 10^{14.81} M_{\odot}$. We find a slope $\alpha = 0.49^{+0.20}_{-0.15}$,
normalization $ \exp(\beta) = 84.0^{+9.2}_{-14.8}$ and $\sigma_{\ln \lambda | \mu} = 0.17^{+0.13}_{-0.09}$
using CFHT richness estimates. In comparison to other weak lensing richness-mass relations, we
find the normalization of the richness statistically agreeing with the normalization of other
scaling relations from a broad redshift range ($0.0<z<0.65$) and with different cluster selection
(X-ray, Sunyaev-Zeldovich, and optical).

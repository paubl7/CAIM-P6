ALMA observations of $z>6$ galaxies have revealed abnormally high [OIII]$_{\rm 88\mu m}$/[CII]$_{\rm
158\mu m}$ ratios and [CII] deficits compared to local galaxies. The origin of this behaviour is
unknown. Numerous solutions have been proposed including differences in C and O abundance ratios,
observational bias, and differences in ISM properties, including ionisation parameter, gas density,
or PDR covering fraction. In order to elucidate the underlying physics that drives this high-redshift
phenomenon, we employ SPHINX$^{20}$, a state-of-the-art, cosmological radiation-hydrodynamics
simulation, that resolves detailed ISM properties of thousands of galaxies in the epoch of reionization.
We find that the observed $z>6$ [OIII]-SFR and [CII]-SFR relations can only be reproduced when the
C/O abundance ratio is $\sim8\times$ lower than Solar and the total metal production is $\sim5.7\times$
higher than that of a Kroupa IMF. This implies that high-redshift galaxies are potentially primarily
enriched by low-metallicity core-collapse supernovae with a more top-heavy IMF. As AGB stars and
type-Ia supernova begin to contribute to the galaxy metallicity, both the [CII]-SFR and [CII] luminosity
functions are predicted to converge to observed values at $z\sim4.5$. While we demonstrate that
ionisation parameter, LyC escape fraction, and CMB attenuation all drive galaxies towards higher
[OIII]/[CII], observed values at $z>6$ can only be reproduced with substantially lower C/O abundances
compared to Solar. The combination of [CII] and [OIII] can be used to predict the values of ionisation
parameter, ISM gas density, and LyC escape fraction. We provide estimates of these quantities for
nine observed $z>6$ galaxies. Finally, we demonstrate that [OI]$_{\rm 63\mu m}$ can be used as a
replacement for [CII] when [CII] is unobserved and argue that more observation time should be used
to target [OI] at $z>6$.

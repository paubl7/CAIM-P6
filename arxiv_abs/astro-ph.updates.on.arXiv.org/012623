Chondrites are sediments of materials left over from the earliest stage of the solar system history.
Based on their undifferentiated nature and less fractionated chemical compositions, chondrites
are widely considered to represent the unprocessed building blocks of the terrestrial planets
and their embryos. Models of chemical composition of the terrestrial planets generally find chondritic
relative abundances of refractory lithophile elements (RLE) in the bulk bodies ("constant RLE
ratio rule"), based on limited variations of RLE ratios among chondritic meteorites and the solar
photosphere. Here, we show that ratios of RLE, such as Nb/Ta, Zr/Hf, Sm/Nd and Al/Ti, are fractionated
from the solar value in chondrules from enstatite chondrites (EC). The fractionated RLE ratios
of individual EC chondrules document different chalcophile affinities of RLE under highly reducing
environments and a separation of RLE-bearing sulfides from silicates before and/or during chondrule
formation. In contrast, the bulk EC have solar-like RLE ratios, indicating that a physical sorting
of silicates and sulfides was negligible before and during the accretion of EC parent bodies. Likewise,
if the Earth's accretion were dominated by EC-like materials, as supported by multiple isotope
systematics, the physical sorting of silicates and sulfides in the accretionary disk should not
have occurred among the Earth's building blocks. Alternatively, the Earth's precursors might
have been high-temperature nebular materials that condensed before the RLE fractionation due
to precipitation of the RLE-bearing sulfides...Highly reduced planets that have experienced
selective removal or accretion of silicates or metal/sulfide phases, such as Mercury, might have
fractionated, non-solar bulk RLE ratios.

Dynamical models of Solar System evolution have suggested that P-/D-type volatile-rich asteroids
formed in the outer Solar System and may be genetically related to the Jupiter Trojans, the comets
and small KBOs. Indeed, their spectral properties resemble that of anhydrous cometary dust. High-angular-resolution
images of P-type asteroid (87) Sylvia with VLT/SPHERE were used to reconstruct its 3D shape, and
to study the dynamics of its two satellites. We also model Sylvia's thermal evolution. The shape
of Sylvia appears flattened and elongated. We derive a volume-equivalent diameter of 271 +/- 5 km,
and a low density of 1378 +/- 45 kg.m-3. The two satellites orbit Sylvia on circular, equatorial orbits.
The oblateness of Sylvia should imply a detectable nodal precession which contrasts with the fully-Keplerian
dynamics of the satellites. This reveals an inhomogeneous internal structure, suggesting that
Sylvia is differentiated. Sylvia's low density and differentiated interior can be explained by
partial melting and mass redistribution through water percolation. The outer shell would be composed
of material similar to interplanetary dust particles (IDPs) and the core similar to aqueously altered
IDPs or carbonaceous chondrite meteorites such as the Tagish Lake meteorite. Numerical simulations
of the thermal evolution of Sylvia show that for a body of such size, partial melting was unavoidable
due to the decay of long-lived radionuclides. In addition, we show that bodies as small as 130-150
km in diameter should have followed a similar thermal evolution, while smaller objects, such as
comets and the KBO Arrokoth, must have remained pristine, in agreement with in situ observations
of these bodies. NASA Lucy mission target (617) Patroclus (diameter~140 km) may, however, be differentiated.

The wavelet-based detrending and denoising method \texttt{TFAW} is applied for the first time
to \texttt{EVEREST 2.0}-corrected light curves to further improve the photometric precision
of almost all K2 observing campaigns (C1-C8, C12-C18). The performance of both methods is evaluated
in terms of 6 hr combined differential photometric precision (CDPP), simulated transit detection
efficiency, and planet characterization in different SNR regimes. On average, \texttt{TFAW}
median 6hr CDPP is $\sim$30$\%$ better than the one achieved by \texttt{EVEREST 2.0} for all observing
campaigns. Using the \texttt{transit least-squares} (\texttt{TLS}) algorithm, we show that
the transit detection efficiency for simulated Earth-Sun-like systems is $\sim$8.5$\times$
higher for \texttt{TFAW}-corrected light curves than for \texttt{EVEREST 2.0} ones. Using the
light curves of two confirmed exoplanets, K2-44 b (high-SNR) and K2-298 b (low-SNR), we show that
\texttt{TFAW} yields better MCMC posterior distributions, transit parameters compatible with
the cataloged ones but with smaller uncertainties and narrows the credibility intervals. We use
the combination of \texttt{TFAW}'s improved photometric precision and \texttt{TLS} enhancement
of the signal detection efficiency for weak signals to search for new transit candidates in K2 observing
campaign 1. We report the discovery of two new K2-C1 Earth-sized planets statistically validated,
using the \texttt{vespa} software: EPIC 201170410.02, with a radius of 1.047$^{+0.276}_{-0.257}R_{\oplus}$
planet orbiting an M-type star, and EPIC 201757695.02, with a radius of 0.908$^{+0.059}_{-0.064}R_{\oplus}$
planet orbiting a K-type star. EPIC 201757695.02 is the 9-th smallest planet ever discovered in
K2-C1, and the 39-th smallest in all K2 campaigns.

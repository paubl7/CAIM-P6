The recent increase in well-localised fast radio bursts (FRBs) has facilitated in-depth studies
of global FRB host properties, the source circumburst medium, and the potential impacts of these
environments on the burst properties. The Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP)
has localised 11 FRBs with sub-arcsecond to arcsecond precision, leading to sub-galaxy localisation
regions in some cases and those covering much of the host galaxy in others. The method used to astrometrically
register the FRB image frame for ASKAP, in order to align it with images taken at other wavelengths,
is currently limited by the brightness of continuum sources detected in the short-duration ('snapshot')
voltage data captured by the Commensal Real-Time ASKAP Fast Transients (CRAFT) software correlator,
which are used to correct for any frame offsets due to imperfect calibration solutions and estimate
the accuracy of any required correction. In this paper, we use dedicated observations of bright,
compact radio sources in ASKAP's low- and mid-frequency bands to investigate the typical astrometric
accuracy of the positions obtained using this so-called 'snapshot' technique. Having captured
these data with both the CRAFT software and ASKAP hardware correlators, we also compare the offset
distributions obtained from both data products to estimate a typical offset between the image frames
resulting from the differing processing paths, laying the groundwork for future use of the longer-duration,
higher signal-to-noise ratio data recorded by the hardware correlator. We find typical offsets
between the two frames of $\sim 0.6$ and $\sim 0.3$ arcsec in the low- and mid-band data, respectively,
for both RA and Dec. We also find reasonable agreement between our offset distributions and those
of the published FRBs. <Abridged>

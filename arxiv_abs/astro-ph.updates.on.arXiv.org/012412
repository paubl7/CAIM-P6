Thermal evolution models suggest that the luminosities of both Uranus and Neptune are inconsistent
with the classical assumption of an adiabatic interior. Such models commonly predict Uranus to
be brighter and, recently, Neptune to be fainter than observed. In this work, we investigate the
influence of a thermally conductive boundary layer on the evolution of Uranus- and Neptune-like
planets. This thermal boundary layer (TBL) is assumed to be located deep in the planet, and be caused
by a steep compositional gradient between a H-He-dominated outer envelope and an ice-rich inner
envelope. We investigate the effect of TBL thickness, thermal conductivity, and the time of TBL
formation on the planet's cooling behaviour. The calculations were performed with our recently
developed tool based on the Henyey method for stellar evolution. We make use of state-of-the-art
equations of state for hydrogen, helium, and water, as well as of thermal conductivity data for water
calculated via ab initio methods. We find that even a thin conductive layer of a few kilometres has
a significant influence on the planetary cooling. In our models, Uranus' measured luminosity can
only be reproduced if the planet has been near equilibrium with the solar incident flux for an extended
time. For Neptune, we find a range of solutions with a near constant effective temperature at layer
thicknesses of 15 km or larger, similar to Uranus. In addition, we find solutions for thin TBLs of
few km and strongly enhanced thermal conductivity. A $\sim$ 1$~$Gyr later onset of the TBL reduces
the present $\Delta T$ by an order of magnitude to only several 100 K. Our models suggest that a TBL
can significantly influence the present planetary luminosity in both directions, making it appear
either brighter or fainter than the adiabatic case.

The formation and presence of clathrate hydrates could influence the composition and stability
of planetary ices and comets; they are at the heart of the development of numerous complex planetary
models, all of which include the necessary condition imposed by their stability curves, some of
which include the cage occupancy or host-guest content and the hydration number, but fewer take
into account the kinetics aspects. We measure the temperature-dependent-diffusion-controlled
formation of the carbon dioxide clathrate hydrate in the 155-210~K range in order to establish the
clathrate formation kinetics at low temperature. We exposed thin water ice films of a few microns
in thickness deposited in a dedicated infrared transmitting closed cell to gaseous carbon dioxide
maintained at a pressure of a few times the pressure at which carbon dioxide clathrate hydrate is
thermodynamically stable. The time dependence of the clathrate formation was monitored with the
recording of specific infrared vibrational modes of CO2 with a Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR)
spectrometer. These experiments clearly show a two-step clathrate formation, particularly at
low temperature, within a relatively simple geometric configuration. We satisfactorily applied
a model combining surface clathration followed by a bulk diffusion-relaxation growth process
to the experiments and derived the temperature-dependent-diffusion coefficient for the bulk
spreading of clathrate. The derived apparent activation energy corresponding to this temperature-dependent-diffusion
coefficient in the considered temperature range is E_a = 24.7 +/- 9.7 kJ/mol. The kinetics parameters
favour a possible carbon dioxide clathrate hydrate nucleation mainly in planets or satellites.

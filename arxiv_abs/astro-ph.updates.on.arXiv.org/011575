The GWAC-N is an observation network composed of multi-aperture and multi-field of view robotic
optical telescopes. The main instruments are the GWAC-A. Besides, several robotic optical telescopes
with narrower field of views provide fast follow-up multi-band capabilities to the GWAC-N. The
primary scientific goal of the GWAC-N is to search for the optical counterparts of GRB that will be
detected by the SVOM. The GWAC-N performs many other observing tasks including the follow-ups of
ToO and both the detection and the monitoring of variable/periodic objects as well as optical transients.
To handle all of those scientific cases, we designed 10 observation modes and 175 observation strategies,
especially, a joint observation strategy with multiple telescopes of the GWAC-N for the follow-up
of GW events. To perform these observations, we thus develop an AOM system in charge of the object
management, the dynamic scheduling of the observation plan and its automatic broadcasting to the
network management and finally the image management. The AOM combines the individual telescopes
into a network and smoothly organizes all the associated operations. The system completely meets
the requirements of the GWAC-N on all its science objectives. With its good portability, the AOM
is scientifically and technically qualified for other general purposed telescope networks. As
the GWAC-N extends and evolves, the AOM will greatly enhance the discovery potential for the GWAC-N.
In the first paper of a series of publications, we present the scientific goals of the GWAC-N as well
as the hardware, the software and the strategy setup to achieve the scientific objectives. The structure,
the technical design, the implementation and performances of the AOM will be also described in details.
In the end, we summarize the current status of the GWAC-N and prospect for the development plan in
the near future.

The North-Ecliptic Pole is an important region for extragalactic surveys. Deep/wide contiguous
surveys are being performed by several space observatories. We analyse all ROSAT pointed and survey
observations within 40 deg2 around the NEP, restricting the field-of-view to the inner 30' radius.
We obtain an X-ray catalogue of 805 sources with 0.5-2 keV fluxes >2.9E-15 cgs, a factor of three deeper
than the ROSAT All-Sky Survey in this field. The sensitivity and angular resolution of our data are
comparable to the eROSITA All-Sky Survey expectations. We use HEROES optical and near-infrared
imaging photometry from Subaru and CFHT telescopes together with literature catalogues and a new
deep and wide Spitzer survey in the field to identify X-ray sources and calculate photometric redshifts
for the candidate counterparts. In particular we utilize mid-IR colours to identify AGN X-ray counterparts.
Despite relatively large error circles and faint counterparts, confusion and systematic errors,
we obtain a rather reliable catalogue of 766 optical counterparts, redshifts and optical classifications.
We find a new population of luminous absorbed X-ray AGN at large redshifts, not recognized in previous
X-ray surveys, but identified in our work due to the unique combination of survey solid angle, X-ray
sensitivity and multiwavelength photometry. We also use the WISE and Spitzer photometry to identify
a sample of 185 AGN selected purely through mid-IR colours, most of which are not detected by ROSAT.
Their redshifts and upper limits to X-ray luminosity and X-ray to optical flux ratios are even higher
than for the new class of X-ray selected luminous AGN2. This unique dataset is important as reference
for future deep surveys in the NEP region. Most of the absorbed distant AGN should be readily picked
up by eROSITA, but they require sensitive mid-IR imaging to be recognized as optical counterparts.

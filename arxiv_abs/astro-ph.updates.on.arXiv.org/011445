The mechanisms that bring galaxies to strongly reduce their star formation activity (star-formation
quenching) is still poorly understood. To better study galaxy evolution, we propose a classification
based on the maps of the ionised hydrogen distribution, traced by kpc-resolved, equivalent width
of H$\alpha$ maps, and the nuclear activity of the galaxies using information from the BPT diagnostic
diagrams. Using these tools, we group a sample of 238 galaxies from the CALIFA survey in six quenching
stages (QS): objects dominated by recent star formation; systems that present a quiescent-nuclear-ring
structure in their centre; galaxies that are centrally-quiescent; galaxies with no clear pattern
in their ionisation gas distribution - mixed; systems that posses only a few star-forming regions
- nearly-retired, or galaxies that are completely quiescent - fully-retired. Regarding their
nuclear activity, we further divide the galaxies into two groups - active systems that host a weak
or strong AGN in their centre, and non-active objects. Galaxies grouped into quenching stage classes
occupy specific locations on the star-formation-rate versus stellar mass diagram. The "Blue cloud"
is populated by the star-forming and the quiescent-nuclear-ring galaxies, the "Green valley"
is populated by centrally-quiescent and mixed systems, "Red sequence" by the nearly- and fully-retired
objects. Generally, galaxies that host a weak or strong AGN show properties, comparable to the non-active
counterparts at the same quenching stages, except for the AGN-hosting star-forming systems. The
degree of the star-formation quenching increases along the present emission-line pattern sequence
from star-forming to fully-retired. The proposed emission-line classes reinforce the "inside-out"
quenching scenario, which foresees that the suppression of the star-formation begins from the
central regions of the galaxies.

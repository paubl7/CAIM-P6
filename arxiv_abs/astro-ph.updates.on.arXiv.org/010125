We used high-spatial resolution (70 pc; 0.3") CO multi-transition (1-0, 2-1, 4-3, and 6-5) ALMA
data to study the physical conditions and kinematics of the cold molecular outflow in the local LIRG
ESO320-G030 (d=48 Mpc, log LIR/Lsun=11.3). ESO320-G030 is a double-barred isolated spiral, but
its compact and obscured nuclear starburst (SFR~15 Msun/yr; Av~40 mag) resembles those of more
luminous ULIRGs. In the outflow, the 1-0/2-1 ratio is enhanced with respect to the rest of the galaxy
and the CO(4-3) transition is undetected. This indicates that the outflowing molecular gas is less
excited than the gas in the nuclear starburst (launching site) and the galaxy disk. Non-LTE radiative
transfer modeling reveals that the properties of the outflow molecular clouds differ from those
of the nuclear and disk clouds: The kinetic temperature is lower (~9 K) in the outflow, and the outflowing
clouds have lower column densities. Assuming a 10^-4 CO abundance, the large internal velocity
gradients, 60^+250_-45 km/s/pc, imply that the outflowing molecular clouds are not bound by self-gravity.
All this suggests that the life-cycle (formation, collapse, dissipation) of the disk clouds might
differ from that of the outflowing clouds which might not be able to form stars. The low Tkin of the
molecular outflow remains constant up to 1.7 kpc. This indicates that the heating by the hotter ionized
outflow phase is not efficient and may favor the survival of the outflow molecular phase. The velocity
structure of the outflow shows a 0.8 km/s/pc velocity gradient between 190-560 pc and then a constant
maximum velocity (~750 km/s) up to 1.7 kpc. This is compatible with a pure gravitational evolution
of the outflow under certain mass outflow rate and launching velocity variations. Alternatively,
ram pressure acceleration and cloud evaporation could explain the observed kinematics and size
of the molecular phase.

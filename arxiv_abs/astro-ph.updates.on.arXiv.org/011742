In this paper, we study the inertial and gravity wave transmissions near the radiative-convective
boundaries in the {\it f}-plane. Two configurations have been considered: waves propagate from
the convective layer to the radiative stratified stable layer, or In this paper, we study inertial
and gravity wave transmissions near radiative-convective boundaries on the {\it f}-plane. Two
configurations have been considered: waves propagate from the convective layer to the radiative
stratified stable layer, or the other way around. It has been found that waves prefer to survive at
low latitudes when the stable layer is strongly stratified ($N^2/(2\Omega)^2>1$). When the stable
layer is weakly stratified ($N^2/(2\Omega)^2<1$), however, waves can survive at any latitude
if the meridional wavenumber is large. Then we have discussed transmission ratios for two buoyancy
frequency structures: the uniform stratification, and the continuously varying stratification.
For the uniform stratification, we have found that the transmission is efficient when the rotation
is rapid, or when the wave is near the critical colatitude. For the continuously varying stratification,
we have discussed the transmission ratio when the square of buoyancy frequency is an algebraic function
$N^2\propto z^{\nu} (\nu >0)$. We have found that the transmission can be efficient when the rotation
is rapid, or when the wave is near the critical colatitude, or when the thickness of the stratification
layer is far greater than the horizontal wave length. The transmission ratio does not depend on the
configurations (radiative layer sits above convective layer, or vice versa; wave propagates outward
or inward), but only on characteristics of the wave (frequency and wavenumber) and the fluid (degree
of stratification).

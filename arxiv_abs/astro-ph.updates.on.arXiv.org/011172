Heartbeat stars are eccentric binaries exhibiting characteristic shape of brightness changes
during periastron passage caused by tidal distortion of the components. Variable tidal potential
can drive tidally excited oscillations (TEOs), which are usually gravity modes. Studies of heartbeat
stars and TEOs open a new possibility to probe interiors of massive stars. There are only a few massive
(masses of components $\gtrsim 2 $M$_\odot$) systems of this type known. Using TESS data from the
first 16 sectors, we searched for new massive heartbeat stars and TEOs using a sample of over 300 eccentric
spectroscopic binaries. We analysed TESS 2-min and 30-min cadence data. Then, we fitted Kumar's
analytical model to the light curves of stars showing heartbeats and performed times-series analysis
of the residuals searching for TEOs and periodic intrinsic variability. We found 20 massive heartbeat
systems, of which seven show TEOs. The TEOs occur at harmonics of orbital frequencies in the range
between 3 and 36, with the median value equal to 9, lower than those in known Kepler systems with TEOs.
The most massive system in this sample is the quadruple star HD 5980, a member of Small Magellanic
Cloud. With the total mass of $\sim$150 M$_{\odot}$ it is the most massive system showing a heartbeat.
Six stars in the sample of the new heartbeat stars are eclipsing. Comparison of the parameters derived
from fitting Kumar's model and from light-curve modelling shows that Kumar's model does not provide
reliable parameters. Finally, intrinsic pulsations of $\beta$ Cep, SPB, $\delta$ Sct, and $\gamma$
Dor-type were found in nine heartbeat systems. This opens an interesting possibility of studies
of pulsation-binarity interaction and the co-existence of forced and self-excited oscillations.

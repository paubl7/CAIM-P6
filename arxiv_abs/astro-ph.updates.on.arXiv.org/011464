The transformation of late-type galaxies has been suggested as the origin of early-type dwarf galaxies
in galaxy clusters. Venhola et al. analysed correlations between colour and surface brightness
for galaxies in the Fornax cluster binned by luminosity or stellar mass. In the bins with $M_\star<10^8
{\rm M}_\odot$, the authors identified a correlation of redness with fainter surface brightness
and interpreted it as a consequence of the quenching of star formation by ram pressure stripping
in the dwarf galaxies. We carry out a corresponding analysis for the Virgo cluster and find great
similarities in these correlations between surface brightness and colour for the two clusters,
despite expected differences in the strength of the ram pressure. Furthermore, we extend the analysis
to a wider range of optical colours for both clusters and contrast the results with expectations
for fading and reddening stellar populations. Overall the slopes of the surface brightness-colour
relations are consistent with these models. In addition the sizes of the early- and late-type galaxies
at these low masses are comparable. These two results are compatible with a transformation scenario.
However, when analysing early- and late-type galaxies separately, the consistency of the slope
of the surface brightness-colour relations with the model expectations for fading and reddening
stellar population applies only to the late types. The lack of this imprint for the early-type dwarfs
calls for some additional explanation, for which we discuss several possibilities. Finally, the
Virgo cluster is an atypical cluster with a low fraction of quiescent early-type galaxies at all
galaxy masses despite its large cluster mass. (abridged)

The International Virtual Observatory Alliance (IVOA) has developed and built, in the last two
decades, an ecosystem of distributed resources, interoperable and based upon open shared technological
standards. In doing so the IVOA has anticipated, putting into practice for the astrophysical domain,
the ideas of FAIR-ness of data and service resources and the Open-ness of sharing scientific results,
leveraging on the underlying open standards required to fill the above. In Europe, efforts in supporting
and developing the ecosystem proposed by the IVOA specifications has been provided by a continuous
set of EU funded projects up to current H2020 ESCAPE ESFRI cluster. In the meantime, in the last years,
Europe has realised the importance of promoting the Open Science approach for the research communities
and started the European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) project to create a distributed environment
for research data, services and communities. In this framework the European VO community, had to
face the move from the interoperability scenario in the astrophysics domain into a larger audience
perspective that includes a cross-domain FAIR approach. Within the ESCAPE project the CEVO Work
Package (Connecting ESFRI to EOSC through the VO) has one task to deal with this integration challenge:
a challenge where an existing, mature, distributed e-infrastructure has to be matched to a forming,
more general architecture. CEVO started its works in the first months of 2019 and has already worked
on the integration of the VO Registry into the EOSC e-infrastructure. This contribution reports
on the first year and a half of integration activities, that involve applications, services and
resources being aware of the VO scenario and compatible with the EOSC architecture.

ESA's INTErnational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory (INTEGRAL) was launched on 17 Oct 2002
at 06:41 CEST. Since then, it has been providing long, uninterrupted observations (up to about 47
hr, or 170 ksec, per satellite orbit of 2.7 days) with a large field-of-view (fully coded: 100 deg^2),
msec time resolution, keV energy resolution, polarization measurements, as well as additional
coverage in the optical. This is realized by two main instruments in the 15 keV to 10 MeV range, the
spectrometer SPI (spectral resolution 3 keV at 1.8 MeV) and the imager IBIS (angular resolution
12 arcmin FWHM), complemented by X-ray (JEM-X; 3-35 keV) and optical (OMC; Johnson V-band) monitors.
All instruments are co-aligned to simultaneously observe the target region. A particle radiation
monitor (IREM) measures charged particle fluxes near the spacecraft. The Anti-coincidence subsystems
of the main instruments are also efficient all-sky gamma-ray detectors, which provide omni-directional
monitoring above ~75 keV. INTEGRAL can also rapidly (within a couple of hours) re-point and conduct
Target of Opportunity observations. INTEGRAL has build an impressive legacy: e.g. discovery of
>600 new high-energy sources; first-ever direct detection of 56Ni and 56Co radio-active decay
lines from a Type Ia supernova; new insights on positron annihilation in the Galactic bulge and disk;
pioneering gamma-ray polarization studies. INTEGRAL is also a successful in multi-messenger
astronomy: INTEGRAL found the first prompt electromagnetic radiation in coincidence with a binary
neutron star merger. More than 1750 papers based on INTEGRAL data have been published in refereed
journals. Here we give a comprehensive update of the satellite status after more than 18 years of
operations in a harsh space environment, and an account of the successful Ground Segment.

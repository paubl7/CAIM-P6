Radio relics are diffuse, extended synchrotron sources that originate from shock fronts generated
during cluster mergers. The massive merging galaxy cluster MACS J0717.5+3745 hosts one of the more
complex relics known to date. We present upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope band 3 (300-500
MHz) and band 4 (550-850 MHz) observations. These new observations, combined with published VLA
and the new LOFAR HBA data, allow us to carry out a detailed, high spatial resolution spectral analysis
of the relic over a broad range of frequencies. The integrated spectrum of the relic closely follows
a power-law between 144 MHz and 5.5 GHz with a mean spectral slope $\alpha=-1.16\pm0.03$. Despite
its complex morphology, the subregions of the relic and the other isolated filaments also follow
power-law behaviors, and show similar spectral slopes. Assuming Diffusive Shock Acceleration,
we estimate a dominant Mach number of $\sim 3.7$ for the shocks that make up the relic. Comparison
with recent numerical simulations suggests that in the case of radio relics, the slopes of the integrated
radio spectra are determined by the Mach number of the accelerating shock, with $\alpha$ nearly
constant, namely between $-1.13$ and $-1.17$, for Mach numbers $3.5 - 4.0$. The spectral shapes
inferred from spatially resolved regions show curvature, we speculate that the relic is inclined
along the line-of-sight. The locus of points in the simulated color-color plots changes significantly
with the relic viewing angle. We conclude that projection effects and inhomogeneities in the shock
Mach number dominate the observed spectral properties of the relic in this complex system. Based
on the new observations we raise the possibility that the relic and a narrow-angle-tailed radio
galaxy are two different structures projected along the same line-of-sight.

We propose a minimal framework to address successful quartic inflation, dark matter (DM) production
in the early universe and non-vanishing tiny Majorana neutrino mass from a common gravitational
origin point of view. In this setup, the quartic inflation is revived successfully via non-minimal
coupling of inflaton to gravity while the production of DM takes place from purely gravitational
effects through a misalignment mechanism. The generation of light Majorana neutrino mass is aided
by explicit breaking of global lepton number symmetry through Planck suppressed operators involving
non-zero vacuum expectation value (VEV) of the inflaton field. We present a detailed study of the
DM yield in presence of non-minimal inflation, considering both the metric and the Palatini formalisms
of gravity wherever appropriate. We reach at some interesting and different results in the DM sector
compared to the earlier works in the similar direction with minimal inflationary background. Restricting
to the light DM regime ($\mathcal{O}(1)$ keV- $\mathcal{O}(100)$ MeV) where classical production
is expected to dominate over the quantum production, we numerically predict the DM mass by varying
the DM quartic and non-minimal coupling, to be consistent with relic density requirements. We also
obtain some non-trivial dependence of DM phenomenology on some of the relevant parameters of the
inflation sector {\it e.g.} non minimal coupling and inflaton VEV. To explore the dependence on
inflationary parameters further, we also estimate the DM relic using the same mechanism for two
other inflationary models consistent with latest data and observe that one of these models predicts
different range of DM mass upto hundreds of TeV.

We use photometric redshifts and statistical background subtraction to measure stellar mass functions
in galaxy group-mass ($4.5-8\times10^{13}~\mathrm{M}_\odot$) haloes at $1<z<1.5$. Groups
are selected from COSMOS and SXDF, based on X-ray imaging and sparse spectroscopy. Stellar mass
($M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$) functions are computed for quiescent and star-forming galaxies separately,
based on their rest-frame $UVJ$ colours. From these we compute the quiescent fraction and quiescent
fraction excess (QFE) relative to the field as a function of $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$. QFE increases
with $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$, similar to more massive clusters at $1<z<1.5$. This contrasts with
the apparent separability of $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$ and environmental factors on galaxy quiescent
fractions at $z\sim 0$. We then compare our results with higher mass clusters at $1<z<1.5$ and lower
redshifts. We find a strong QFE dependence on halo mass at fixed $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$; well fit
by a logarithmic slope of $\mathrm{d}(\mathrm{QFE})/\mathrm{d}\log (M_{\mathrm{halo}}) \sim
0.24 \pm 0.04$ for all $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$ and redshift bins. This dependence is in remarkably
good qualitative agreement with the hydrodynamic simulation BAHAMAS, but contradicts the observed
dependence of QFE on $M_{\mathrm{stellar}}$. We interpret the results using two toy models: one
where a time delay until rapid (instantaneous) quenching begins upon accretion to the main progenitor
("no pre-processing") and one where it starts upon first becoming a satellite ("pre-processing").
Delay times appear to be halo mass dependent, with a significantly stronger dependence required
without pre-processing. We conclude that our results support models in which environmental quenching
begins in low-mass ($<10^{14}M_\odot$) haloes at $z>1$.

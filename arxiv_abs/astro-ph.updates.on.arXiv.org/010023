Solar activity, ranging from the background solar wind to energetic coronal mass ejections (CMEs),
is the main driver of the conditions in the interplanetary space and in the terrestrial space environment,
known as space weather. A better understanding of the Sun-Earth connection carries enormous potential
to mitigate negative space weather effects with economic and social benefits. Effective space
weather forecasting relies on data and models. In this paper, we discuss some of the most used space
weather models, and propose suitable locations for data gathering with space weather purposes.
We report on the application of \textit{Representer analysis (RA)} and \textit{Domain of Influence
(DOI) analysis} to three models simulating different stages of the Sun-Earth connection: the OpenGGCM
and Tsyganenko models, focusing on solar wind - magnetosphere interaction, and the PLUTO model,
used to simulate CME propagation in interplanetary space. Our analysis is promising for space weather
purposes for several reasons. First, we obtain quantitative information about the most useful
locations of observation points, such as solar wind monitors. For example, we find that the absolute
values of the DOI are extremely low in the magnetospheric plasma sheet. Since knowledge of that particular
sub-system is crucial for space weather, enhanced monitoring of the region would be most beneficial.
Second, we are able to better characterize the models. Although the current analysis focuses on
spatial rather than temporal correlations, we find that time-independent models are less useful
for Data Assimilation activities than time-dependent models. Third, we take the first steps towards
the ambitious goal of identifying the most relevant heliospheric parameters for modelling CME
propagation in the heliosphere, their arrival time, and their geoeffectiveness at Earth.

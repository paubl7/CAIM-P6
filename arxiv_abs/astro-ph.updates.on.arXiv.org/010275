Cm-wavelength radio continuum emission in excess of free-free, synchrotron and Rayleigh-Jeans
dust emission (excess microwave emission, EME), and often called `anomalous microwave emission',
is bright in molecular cloud regions exposed to UV radiation, i.e. in photo-dissociation regions
(PDRs). The EME correlates with IR dust emission on degree angular scales. Resolved observations
of well-studied PDRs are needed to compare the spectral variations of the cm-continuum with tracers
of physical conditions and of the dust grain population. The EME is particularly bright in the regions
of the rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud (rho Oph) that surround the earliest type star in the complex,
HD147889, where the peak signal stems from the filament known as the rho Oph-W PDR. Interestingly,
the EME-IR correlation breaks down on ~10arcmin scales in rho Oph. Here we report on resolved observations
of the rho Oph-W PDR acquired with ATCA+CABB. We recover extended emission using a variant of non-parametric
image synthesis performed in the sky plane. The multi-frequency 17GHz to 39GHz mosaics of rho Oph
reveal spectral variations in the cm-wavelength continuum. At ~30arcsec resolutions, the 17GHz
and 20GHz intensities in rho Oph W follow tightly the near-IR filament, Icm propto I(8um), despite
its breakdown on larger angular scales. However, while the 33-39GHz filament is parallel to IRAC8um,
it is offset by 15-20 arcsec towards the UV source. Such morphological differences in frequency
reflect spectral variations, which we quantify spectroscopically as a sharp and steepening high-frequency
cutoff, interpreted in terms of the spinning dust emission mechanism as a minimum grain size a_cutoff
sim 6+-1A that increases deeper into the PDR.

We present a detailed modeling and computation methodology to determine the optical Cherenkov
signals produced by upward-moving extensive air showers (EASs) induced by $\tau$-leptons and
muons, sourced from the interaction of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos interacting in the
Earth. Following and extending the physics modeling and Cherenkov signal simulations performed
in arxiv:1902.11287, this scheme encompasses a new, state-of-the-art computation of the muon
neutrino propagation inside the Earth and the contribution to the $\tau$-lepton muon decay channel.
The modeling takes into account all possible $\tau$-lepton decay and muon energy loss channels
that feed the optical Cherenkov emission, produced by both tau and muon initiated EASs. The EAS modeling
uses the electron energy, angular, and lateral distributions in the EAS and their evolution as well
as the wavelength dependence of the Cherenkov emission and its atmospheric attenuation. The results
presented here are focused on the detection capabilities of sub-orbital (balloon-borne) and orbital
(satellite) based instruments. The latter case was calculated for POEMMA to compare to that presented
in arxiv:1902.11287, specifically including the muon-decay channel of $\tau$-leptons and the
muonic EAS Cherenkov signal from muon neutrino interactions in the Earth. By detailing all these
individual contributions to the optical Cherenkov emission and detection, we show how the ensemble
that includes muonic channels provides a large detection capability for space-based, high-energy
cosmic neutrino detection. Specifically, we show that for neutrino energies $\lt$ 10 PeV, the upward-EAS
sensitivity due to muon neutrino interactions in the Earth begin to dominate over that for tau neutrino
interactions, effectively extending the neutrino sensitivity to lower energies.

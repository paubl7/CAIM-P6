Eclipsing binary systems with components that pulsate in gravity modes ($g$ modes) allow for simultaneous
and independent constraints of the chemical mixing profiles of stars. We aim to assemble a sample
of $g$-mode pulsators in detached eclipsing binaries with the purpose of finding good candidates
for future evolutionary and asteroseismic modelling. In addition, we present a case study of the
eclipsing binary KIC9850387, identified as our most promising candidate. We selected all of the
detached eclipsing binaries in the Kepler eclipsing binary catalogue and performed a visual inspection
to determine the presence and density of $g$ modes, and the presence of $g$-mode period-spacing
patterns in their frequency spectra. We then characterised our sample based on their $g$-mode pulsational
parameters and binary and atmospheric parameters. A spectroscopic follow-up of KIC9850387 was
then performed. We then performed spectral disentangling followed by atmospheric modelling and
abundance analysis for the primary star. We utilised an iterative approach to simultaneously optimise
the pulsational and eclipse models, and subsequently performed an analysis of the pressure- ($p$-)
and $g$-mode pulsational frequencies. We compiled a sample of 93 Kepler eclipsing binary stars
with $g$-mode pulsating components and identified clear $g$-mode period-spacing patterns in
the frequency spectra of seven of these systems. We found that the $g$-mode pulsational parameters
and the binary and atmospheric parameters of our sample are weakly correlated at best. We find that
the eclipsing binary KIC9850387 is a double-lined spectroscopic binary in a near-circular orbit
with an intermediate-mass primary, and a solar-like secondary. We find $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ period-spacing
patterns in the frequency spectrum of KIC9850387 spanning more than ten radial orders each.

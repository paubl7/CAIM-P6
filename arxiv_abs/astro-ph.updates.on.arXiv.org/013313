Understanding the physical connection between cluster galaxies and massive haloes is key to mitigating
systematic uncertainties in next-generation cluster cosmology. We develop a novel method to infer
the level of conformity between the stellar mass of the brightest central galaxies~(BCGs) $M_*^{BCG}$
and the satellite richness $\lambda$, defined as their correlation coefficient $\rho_{cc}$ at
fixed halo mass, using the abundance and weak lensing of SDSS clusters as functions of $M_*^{BCG}$
and $\lambda$. We detect a halo mass-dependent conformity as $\rho_{cc}{=}0.60{+}0.08\ln(M_h/3{\times}10^{14}M_{\odot}/h)$.
The strong conformity successfully resolves the "halo mass equality" conundrum discovered in
Zu et al. 2021 --- when split by $M_*^{BCG}$ at fixed $\lambda$, the low and high-$M_*^{BCG}$ clusters
have the same average halo mass despite having a $0.34$ dex discrepancy in average $M_*^{BCG}$.
On top of the best--fitting conformity model, we develop a cluster assembly bias~(AB) prescription
calibrated against the CosmicGrowth simulation, and build a conformity+AB model for the cluster
weak lensing measurements. Our model predicts that with a ${\sim}20\%$ lower halo concentration
$c$, the low-$M_*^{BCG}$ clusters are ${\sim}10\%$ more biased than the high-$M_*^{BCG}$ systems,
in excellent agreement with the observations. We also show that the observed conformity and assembly
bias are unlikely due to projection effects. Finally, we build a toy model to argue that while the
early-time BCG-halo co-evolution drives the $M_*^{BCG}$-$c$ correlation, the late-time dry
merger-induced BCG growth naturally produces the $M_*^{BCG}$-$\lambda$ conformity despite
the well-known anti-correlation between $\lambda$ and $c$. Our method paves the path towards simultaneously
constraining cosmology and cluster formation with future cluster surveys.

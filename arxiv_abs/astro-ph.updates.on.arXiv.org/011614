In the massive star-forming region IRAS 21078+5211, a highly fragmented cluster (0.1~pc in size)
of molecular cores is observed, located at the density peak of an elongated (1~pc in size) molecular
cloud. A small (1~km/s per 0.1~pc) LSR velocity (Vlsr) gradient is detected across the axis of the
molecular cloud. Assuming we are observing a mass flow from the harboring cloud to the cluster, we
derive a mass infall rate of about 10^{-4}~M_{sun}~yr^{-1}. The most massive cores (labeled 1,
2, and 3) are found at the center of the cluster, and these are the only ones that present a signature
of protostellar activity in terms of emission from high-excitation molecular lines or a molecular
outflow. We reveal an extended (size about 0.1~pc), bipolar collimated molecular outflow emerging
from core 1. We believe this is powered by a (previously discovered) compact (size <= 1000~au) radio
jet, ejected by a YSO embedded in core 1 (named YSO-1), since the molecular outflow and the radio jet
are almost parallel and have a comparable momentum rate. By means of high-excitation lines, we find
a large (14~km/s over 500~au) Vlsr gradient at the position of YSO-1, oriented approximately perpendicular
to the radio jet. Assuming this is an edge-on, rotating disk and fitting a Keplerian rotation pattern,
we determine the YSO-1 mass to be 5.6+/-2.0~M_{sun}. The water masers (previously observed with
VLBI) emerge within 100-300~au from YSO-1 and are unique tracers of the jet kinematics. Their three-dimensional
(3D) velocity pattern reveals that the gas flows along, and rotates about, the jet axis. We show that
the 3D maser velocities are fully consistent with the magneto-centrifugal disk-wind models predicting
a cylindrical rotating jet. Under this hypothesis, we determine the jet radius to be about 16~au
and the corresponding launching radius and terminal velocity to be about 2.2~au and 200~km/s, respectively.

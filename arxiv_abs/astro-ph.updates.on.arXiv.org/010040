Propagation of Galactic cosmic rays (CR) in the interstellar medium (ISM) is among the unsolved
problems in particle astrophysics. Interpretation of CR spectrum and composition measurements
and their possible link to dark matter crucially relies on our understanding of CR propagation in
the Galaxy. Several air shower experiments have measured a significant anisotropy of CRs in the
TeV to PeV energy range. These observations hint to a complicated overlap of more than one cause:
from the distribution of the CR sources in the Milky Way to the nature of such sources, from the turbulence
properties of interstellar plasmas to the inhomogeneous nature of the interstellar medium. Coherent
magnetic structures such as the heliosphere greatly influence the CR arrival direction distribution.
It is necessary to account for and remove the heliosphere's distortion effects if we want to determine
the pristine CR arrival direction distribution in the local interstellar medium (LISM), the environment
surrounding the solar system up to the distance of particle mean free path. The recent availability
of accurate all-sky maps of CR arrival direction distribution and the latest advancements in heliospheric
modeling, make it possible to infer the CR pitch angle distribution in the LISM using a Liouville
mapping technique. With the interstellar CR distribution, we can study the global characteristics
of CR diffusion, tap into the properties of interstellar plasma turbulence, test the recent and
local CR source hypothesis, and whether clumps of dark matter have a role in the observed CR observations.
The study can lead to developments aiming to a better understanding of the heliosphere, particularly
the boundary region with the ISM, and additional constraints on the LISM properties.

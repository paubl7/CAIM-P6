We constrain deviations from general relativity (GR) including both redshift and scale dependencies
in the modified gravity (MG) parameters. In particular, we employ the under-used binning approach
and compare the results to functional forms. We use available datasets such as Cosmic Microwave
Background (CMB) from Planck 2018, Baryonic Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and Redshift Space Distortions
(BAO/RSD) from the BOSS DR12, the 6DF Galaxy Survey, the SDSS DR7 Main Galaxy Sample, the correlation
of Lyman-$\alpha$ forest absorption and quasars from SDSS-DR14, Supernova Type Ia (SNe) from the
Pantheon compilation, and DES Y1 data. Moreover, in order to maximize the constraining power from
available datasets, we analyze MG models where we alternatively set some of the MG parameters to
their GR values and vary the others. Using functional forms, we find an up to 3.5-$\sigma$ tension
with GR in $\Sigma$ (while $\mu$ is fixed) when using Planck+SNe+BAO+RSD; this goes away when lensing
data is included, i.e. CMB lensing and DES (CMBL+DES). Using different binning methods, we find
that a tension with GR above 2-$\sigma$ in the (high-z, high-k) bin is persistent even when including
CMBL+DES to Planck+SNe+BAO+RSD. Also, we find another tension above 2-$\sigma$ in the (low-z,
high-k) bin, but that can be reduced with the addition of lensing data. Furthermore, we perform a
model comparison using the Deviance Information Criterion statistical tool and find that the MG
model ($\mu=1$, $\Sigma$) is weakly favored by the data compared to $\Lambda$CDM, except when DES
data is included. Another noteworthy result is that we find that the binning methods do not agree
with the widely-used functional parameterization where the MG parameters are proportional to
$\Omega_{\text{DE}}(a)$, and this is clearly apparent in the high-z and high-k regime where this
parameterization underestimates the deviations from GR.

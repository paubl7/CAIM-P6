We investigate the mineralogy of L5 Martian Trojan asteroids via reflectance spectroscopy, in
particular (101429) 1998 $\mbox{VF}_{31}$, the only L5 Trojan that does not belong to the Eureka
family (Christou, 2013). We find that this asteroid most likely belongs to the Bus-Demeo S-complex,
in agreement with Rivkin et al. (2007) and obtain good spectral matches with Sq- or S-type asteroids,
the lunar surface and of Martian and lunar meteorites. Mixture fitting to spectral endmembers suggests
a surface abundance of Mg-rich orthopyroxene and iron metal or, alternatively, a mixture of plagioclase
and metal with a small amount of Mg-poor orthopyroxene. The metallic component may be part of the
intrinsic mineral makeup of the asteroid or an indication of extreme space weathering. We discuss
several origin scenarios for (101429). The asteroid could be related to iron-rich primitive achondrites
(Rivkin et al.), may have originated as impact ejecta from Mars - as proposed recently for the Eureka
family asteroids (Polishook et al., 2017) - or could be a relic fragment of the Moon's original solid
crust. If, on the other hand, (101429) is a relatively recent addition to the Martian Trojan clouds
(Christou et al., 2020), its origin is probably traced to high-inclination asteroid families in
the Inner Main Belt. For the olivine-dominated Eureka family, we find that the two smaller asteroids
are more spectrally similar to one another than to (5261) Eureka. Spectral profiles of all three
asteroids are closely similar shortward of $\sim$0.7$\mu$m but diverge at longer wavelengths.
For the two smaller asteroids in particular, we find the spectra are virtually identical up to $0.8$$\mu$m.
We attribute spectral differences in the near-IR region to differences in either: degree of space
weathering, olivine chemical composition and/or regolith grain size.

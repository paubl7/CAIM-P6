Studying the resolved stellar populations of the different structural components which build
massive galaxies directly unveils their assembly history. We aim at characterizing the stellar
population properties of a representative sample of bulges and pure spheroids in massive galaxies
($M_{\star}>10^{10}$ M$_{\odot}$) in the GOODS-N field. We take advantage of the spectral and
spatial information provided by SHARDS and HST data to perform the multi-image spectro-photometrical
decoupling of the galaxy light. We derive the spectral energy distribution separately for bulges
and disks in the redshift range $0.14<z\leq1$ with spectral resolution $R\sim50$. Analyzing these
SEDs, we find evidences of a bimodal distribution of bulge formation redshifts. We find that 33%
of them present old mass-weighted ages, implying a median formation redshift $z_{\rm{form}}={6.2}_{-1.7}^{+1.5}$.
They are relics of the early Universe embedded in disk galaxies. A second wave, dominant in number,
accounts for bulges formed at median redshift $z_{\rm{form}}={1.3}_{-0.6}^{+0.6}$. The oldest
(1$^{\rm{st}}$-wave) bulges are more compact than the youngest. Virtually all pure spheroids
(i.e., those without any disk) are coetaneous with the 2$^{\rm{nd}}$-wave bulges, presenting
a median redshift of formation $z_{\rm{form}}={1.1}_{-0.3}^{+0.3}$. The two waves of bulge formation
are not only distinguishable in terms of stellar ages, but also in star formation mode. All 1$^{\rm
st}$-wave bulges formed fast at $z\sim6$, with typical timescales around 200 Myr. A significant
fraction of the 2$^{\rm{nd}}$-wave bulges assembled more slowly, with star formation timescales
as long as 1 Gyr. The results of this work suggest that the centers of massive disk-like galaxies actually
harbor the oldest spheroids formed in the Universe.

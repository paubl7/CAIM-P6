We investigate the specific angular momentum (sAM) $ j(<r)$ profiles of intermediate redshift
($0.4<z<1.4$) star-forming galaxies (SFGs) in the relatively unexplored regime of low masses
(down to $M_\star\sim 10^8$M$_{\odot}$) and small sizes (down to $R_{\rm e}\sim 1.5$ kpc) and characterize
the sAM scaling relation and its redshift evolution. We have developed a 3D methodology to constrain
sAM profiles of the star-forming gas using a forward modeling approach with \galpak{} that incorporates
the effects of beam smearing, yielding the intrinsic morpho-kinematic properties even with limited
spatial resolution data. Using mock observations from the TNG50 simulation, we find that our 3D
methodology robustly recovers the SFR-weighted $j(<r)$ profiles down to low effective signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) of $\gtrapprox3$. We apply our methodology blindly to a sample of 494 \OII{}-selected
SFGs in the MUSE Ultra Deep Field (UDF) 9~arcmin$^2$ mosaic data, covering the unexplored $8<\log
M_*/$M$_{\odot}<9$ mass range. We find that the (SFR-weighted) sAM relation follows $j\propto
M_\star^{\alpha}$ with an index $\alpha$ varying from $\alpha=0.3$ to $\alpha=0.5$, from $\log
M_\star/$M$_{\odot}=8$ to $\log M_*/$M$_{\odot}=10.5$. The UDF sample supports a redshift evolution
consistent with the $(1+z)^{-0.5}$ expectation from a Universe in expansion. The scatter of the
sAM sequence is a strong function of the dynamical state with $\log j|_{M_*}\propto 0.65 \times
\log(V_{\rm max}/\sigma)$ where $\sigma$ is the velocity dispersion at $2 R_{\rm e}$. In TNG50,
SFGs also form a $j-M_{\star}-(V/\sigma)$ plane but correlates more with galaxy size than with
morphological parameters. Our results suggest that SFGs might experience a dynamical transformation
before their morphological transformation to becoming passive via either merging or secular evolution.

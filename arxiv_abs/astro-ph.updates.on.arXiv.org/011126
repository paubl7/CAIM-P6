Recent estimations of the Hubble parameter $H_0$ based on gravitational waves (GW) observations
can be used to shed some light on the discrepancy between the value of the Hubble parameter $H_0^P$
obtained from large scale observations such as the Plank mission, and the small scale value $H_0^R$,
obtained from low redshift supernovae (SN). In order to investigate the origin of this discrepancy
we perform a combined analysis of the luminosity distance of SN and GW sources and reconstruct the
velocity and density field, using different SNs catalogues. For the Union 2.1 catalogue we obtain
evidence of a local inhomogeneity with a density contrast $\delta_v=-0.462 \pm 0.031$, extending
up to a redshift of $z_v= 0.081\pm 0.007$, while for the Pantheon catalogue we obtain $\delta_v=-0.106
\pm 0.026$ and $z_v = 0.055 \pm 0.003$. An inhomogeneous model with $H_0^P$ is in general favored
with respect to a homogeneous model with $H_0^R$, but there is a significant difference between
the size and depth of the inhomogeneity obtained using the two datasets, which could be due to some
inconsistencies in the redshift correction applied to Pantheon data, which is not publicly available
as raw data without redshift correction, contrary to Union 2.1. This shows the importance of making
the raw data directly available to the scientific community. The dominant monopole effect of this
inhomogeneity on the luminosity distance is proportional to the volume average of the density contrast
inside the sphere of radius equal to the distance of the source, which is suppressed outside the inhomogeneity
by the inverse cube of the distance. As a direct consequence, since most of the GW sources are located
outside this inhomogeneity, they are only negligibly affected by it.

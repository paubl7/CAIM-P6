The tight correlations between the mass of supermassive black holes ($M_{\rm BH}$) and their host-galaxy
properties have been of great interest to the astrophysical community, but a clear understanding
of their origin and fundamental drivers still eludes us. The local relations for active galaxies
are interesting in their own right and form the foundation for any evolutionary study over cosmic
time. We present Hubble Space Telescope optical imaging of a sample of 66 local active galactic nuclei
(AGNs); for 14 objects, we also obtained Gemini near-infrared images. We use state-of-the-art
methods to perform surface photometry of the AGN host galaxies, decomposing them in spheroid, disk
and bar (when present) and inferring the luminosity and stellar mass of the components. We combine
this information with spatially-resolved kinematics obtained at the Keck Telescopes to study
the correlations between $M_{\rm BH}$ (determined from single-epoch virial estimators) and host
galaxy properties. Our sample extends the correlation found for quiescent galaxies down to $M_{\rm
BH}$ $\sim$ $10^7$ $M_{\odot}$ along a consistent line. The correlations are uniformly tight for
our AGN sample, with intrinsic scatter 0.2-0.4 dex, smaller or equal to that of quiescent galaxies.
We find no difference between pseudo and classical bulges or barred and non-barred galaxies. We
show that all the tight correlations can be simultaneously satisfied by AGN hosts in the $10^7-10^9$
$M_{\odot}$ regime, with data of sufficient quality. The $M_{\rm BH}$-$\sigma$ relation is also
in excellent agreement with that of AGN with $M_{\rm BH}$ obtained from reverberation mapping,
providing an indirect validation of single-epoch virial estimators of $M_{\rm BH}$.

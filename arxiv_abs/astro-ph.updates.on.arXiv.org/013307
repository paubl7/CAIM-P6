Over the past two decades, thousands of confirmed exoplanets have been detected; the next major
challenge is to characterize these other worlds and their stellar systems. Much information on
the composition and formation of exoplanets and circumstellar debris disks can only be achieved
via direct imaging. Direct imaging is challenging because of the small angular separations ($<1$
arcsec) and high star-to-planet flux ratios (${\sim}10^{9}$ for a Jupiter analog or ${\sim}10^{10}$
for an Earth analog in the visible). Atmospheric turbulence prohibits reaching such high flux ratios
on the ground, so observations must be made above the Earth's atmosphere. The Nancy Grace Roman Space
Telescope (Roman), set to launch in the mid-2020s, will be the first space-based observatory to
demonstrate high-contrast imaging with active wavefront control using its Coronagraph Instrument.
The instrument's main purpose is to mature the various technologies needed for a future flagship
mission to image and characterize Earth-like exoplanets. These technologies include two high-actuator-count
deformable mirrors, photon-counting detectors, two complementary wavefront sensing and control
loops, and two different coronagraph types. In this paper, we describe the complete set of flight
coronagraph mask designs and their intended combinations in the Roman Coronagraph Instrument.
There are three types of mask configurations included: a primary one designed to meet the instrument's
top-level requirement, three that are supported on a best-effort basis, and several unsupported
ones contributed by the NASA Exoplanet Exploration Program. The unsupported mask configurations
could be commissioned and used if the instrument is approved for operations after its initial technology
demonstration phase.

On 2020 April 19 a coronal mass ejection (CME) was detected in situ by Solar Orbiter at a heliocentric
distance of about 0.8 AU. The CME was later observed in situ on April 20th by the Wind and BepiColombo
spacecraft whilst BepiColombo was located very close to Earth. This CME presents a good opportunity
for a triple radial alignment study, as the spacecraft were separated by less than 5$^\circ$ in longitude.
The source of the CME, which was launched on April 15th, was an almost entirely isolated streamer
blowout. STEREO-A observed the event remotely from -75.1$^\circ$ longitude, which is an exceptionally
well suited viewpoint for heliospheric imaging of an Earth directed CME. The configuration of the
four spacecraft has provided an exceptionally clean link between remote imaging and in situ observations
of the CME. We have used the in situ observations of the CME at Solar Orbiter, Wind, and BepiColombo,
and the remote observations of the CME at STEREO-A in combination with flux rope models to determine
the global shape of the CME and its evolution as it propagated through the inner heliosphere. A clear
flattening of the CME cross-section has been observed by STEREO-A, and further confirmed by comparing
profiles of the flux rope models to the in situ data, where the distorted flux rope cross-section
qualitatively agrees most with in situ observations of the magnetic field at Solar Orbiter. Comparing
in situ observations of the magnetic field between spacecraft, we find that the dependence of the
maximum (mean) magnetic field strength decreases with heliocentric distance as $r^{-1.24 \pm
0.50}$ ($r^{-1.12 \pm 0.14}$), in disagreement with previous studies. Further assessment of the
axial and poloidal magnetic field strength dependencies suggests that the expansion of the CME
is likely neither self-similar nor cylindrically symmetric.

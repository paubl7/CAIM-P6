Under cold conditions in dense cores, gas-phase molecules and atoms are depleted from the gas-phase
to the surface of interstellar grains. Considering the time scales and physical conditions within
these cores, a portion of these molecules has to be brought back into the gas-phase to explain their
observation by milimeter telescopes. We tested the respective efficiencies of the different mechanisms
commonly included in the models. We also tested the addition of sputtering of ice grain mantles via
a collision with cosmic rays in the electronic stopping power regime. The ice sputtering induced
by cosmic rays has been added to the Nautilus gas-grain model while the other processes were already
present. Each of these processes were tested on a 1D physical structure determined by observations
in TMC1 cold cores. The resulting 1D chemical structure was also compared to methanol gas-phase
abundances observed in these cores. We found that all species are not sensitive in the same way to
the non-thermal desorption mechanisms, and the sensitivity also depends on the physical conditions.
Thus, it is mandatory to include all of them. Chemical desorption seems to be essential in reproducing
the observations for H densities smaller than $4\times 10^4$~cm$^{-3}$, whereas sputtering is
essential above this density. The models are, however, systematically below the observed methanol
abundances. A more efficient chemical desorption and a more efficient sputtering could better
reproduce the observations. In conclusion, the sputtering of ices by cosmic-rays collisions may
be the most efficient desorption mechanism at high density (a few $10^4$~cm$^{-3}$ under the conditions
studied here) in cold cores, whereas chemical desorption is still required at smaller densities.
Additional works are needed on both mechanisms to assess their efficiency with respect to the main
ice composition.

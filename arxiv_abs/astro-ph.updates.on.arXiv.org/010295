We studied the variability of the linear polarization and brightness of the $\gamma$-ray binary
LS I +61 303. High-precision BVR photopolarimetric observations were carried out with the Dipol-2
polarimeter on the 2.2 m remotely controlled UH88 telescope at Mauna Kea Observatory and the 60 cm
Tohoku telescope at Haleakala Observatory (Hawaii) over 140 nights in 2016--2019. We determined
the position angle of the intrinsic polarization $\theta \simeq 11^\circ$, which can either be
associated with the projection of the Be star's decretion disk axis on the plane of sky, or can differ
from it by $90^\circ$. Using the Lomb-Scargle method, we performed timing analyses and period searches
of our polarimetric and photometric data. We found statistically significant periodic variability
of the normalized Stokes parameters $q$ and $u$ in all passbands. The most significant period of
variability, $P_\text{Pol} = 13.244 \pm 0.012$ d, is equal to one half of the orbital period $P_\text{orb}
= 26.496$ d. Using a model of Thomson scattering by a cloud that orbits the Be star, we obtained constraints
on the orbital parameters, including a small eccentricity $e<0.2$ and periastron phase of $\phi_\text{p}\approx
0.6$, which coincides with the peaks in the radio, X-ray, and TeV emission. These constraints are
independent of the assumption about the orientation of the decretion disk plane on the sky. We also
extensively discuss the apparent inconsistency with the previous measurements of the orbital
parameters from radial velocities. By folding the photometry data acquired during a three-year
time span with the orbital period, we found a linear phase shift of the moments of the brightness maximum,
confirming the possible existence of superorbital variability.

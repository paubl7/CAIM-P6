Two repeating FRB sources, FRB180916 (CHIME/FRB Collaboration, 2020) and FRB121102 (Rajwade,
et al., 2020) display periodic windowed behavior (PWB) in the times of FRB detections. In PWB, events
only occur within a periodic window spanning some fraction of the period, but no events may occur
during many of the periods. During UT 2020 April 28, two peaks of a soft gamma burst (Li, et al., 2021)
were identified with two FRB peaks (Kirsten, et al., 2020) from soft gamma repeater (SGR) 1935+2154.
As SGRs are a type of magnetar, these observations establish a link between at least some FRBs and
magnetars. The analysis herein, which selects the period giving the minimum window fraction, shows
PWB in this sources soft gamma-ray emission. For 161 bursts from 2014 through 2020 from IPN (Interplanetary
Network) instruments, a clearly resolved minimum in window fraction vs. period occurs at a 231 day
period, and 55 percent window fraction. The data cover only 6 bursting episodes, however, the periodicity
result appears relatively robust: First, the IPN has excellent time coverage and is unlikely to
miss bursts outside of these windows. Second, for various data subsets (with significantly less
bursts), either the best or second best measured period was consistent with 231 days, even in the
sub-sample with the richest bursting episode removed. In addition, simulations show that even
small numbers of uniform random bursts do not show PWB, and that the results are not due to limited
sampling. The apparent PWB could have alternative explanations; a firm conclusion of PWB would
be evident, however, after the observation of more consistent episodes. If the periodicity of this
SGR's bursts can be verified, and if similar behavior were observed in other repeating FRB sources,
it might suggest a linkage between FRB and SGR burst mechanisms or emission conditions.

The success of the multi-messenger astronomy relies on gravitational-wave observatories like
LIGO and Virgo to provide prompt warning of merger events involving neutron stars (including both
binary neutron stars and neutron-star-black-holes), which further depends critically on the
low-frequency sensitivity of LIGO as a typical binary neutron star stays in this band for minutes.
However, the current sub-60 Hz sensitivity of LIGO has not yet reached its design target and the excess
noise can be more than an order of magnitude below 20 Hz. It is limited by nonlinearly coupled noises
from auxiliary control loops which are also nonstationary, posing challenges to realistic early-warning
pipelines. Nevertheless, machine-learning-based neural networks provide ways to simultaneously
improve the low-frequency sensitivity and mitigate its nonstationarity, and detect the real-time
gravitational-wave signal with a very short computational time. We propose to achieve this by inputting
both the main gravitational-wave readout and key auxiliary witnesses to a compound neural network.
Using simulated data with characteristic representing the real LIGO detectors, our machine-learning-based
neural networks can reduce nonlinearly coupled noise by about a factor of 5 and allows a typical binary
neutron star (neutron-star-black-hole) to be detected 100 s (10 s) before the merger at a distance
of 40 Mpc (160 Mpc). If one can further reduce the noise to the fundamental limit, our neural networks
can achieve detection out to a distance of 80 Mpc and 240 Mpc for binary neutron stars and neutron-star-black-holes,
respectively. It thus demonstrates that utilizing machine-learning-based neural networks is
a promising direction for the timely detection of the coalescence of electromagnetically bright
LIGO/Virgo sources.

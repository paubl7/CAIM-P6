Measurements of visible and near-infrared reflection (0.38-5 {\mu}m) and mid to far infrared emission
(5-200 {\mu}m) from telescope and satellite remote sensing instruments make it possible to investigate
the composition of planetary surfaces via electronic transitions and vibrational modes of chemical
bonds. Red spectral slopes at visible and near infrared wavelengths and absorption features at
3.3 and 3.4 {\mu}m observed in circumstellar disks, the interstellar medium, and on the surfaces
of solar-system bodies are interpreted to be due to the presence of organic material and other carbon
compounds. Identifying the origin of these features requires measurements of the optical properties
of a variety of relevant analog and planetary materials. Spectroscopic models of dust within circumstellar
disks and the interstellar medium as well as planetary regoliths often incorporate just one such
laboratory measurement despite the wide variation in absorption and extinction properties of
organic and other carbon-bearing materials. Here we present laboratory measurements of transmission
spectra in the 1.5-13 {\mu}m region and use these to derive real and imaginary indices of refraction
for two samples: 1) an analog to meteoritic insoluble organic matter and 2) a powdered Allende meteorite
sample. We also test our refractive index retrieval method on a previously published transmission
spectrum of an Mg-rich olivine. We compare optical measurements of the insoluble organic-matter
analog to those of other solar-system and extrasolar organic analogs, such as amorphous carbon
and tholins, and find that the indices of refraction of the newly characterized material differ
significantly from other carbonaceous samples.

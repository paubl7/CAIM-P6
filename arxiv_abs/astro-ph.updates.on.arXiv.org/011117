We present a clean, magnitude-limited (IRAC1 or WISE1$\leq$15.0 mag) multiwavelength source
catalog for the LMC. The catalog was built upon crossmatching ($1''$) and deblending ($3''$) between
the SEIP source list and Gaia DR2, with strict constraints on the Gaia astrometric solution to remove
the foreground contamination. The catalog contains 197,004 targets in 52 different bands including
2 ultraviolet, 21 optical, and 29 infrared bands. Additional information about radial velocities
and spectral/photometric classifications were collected from the literature. The bright end
of our sample is mostly comprised of blue helium-burning stars (BHeBs) and red HeBs with inevitable
contamination of main sequence stars at the blue end. After applying modified magnitude and color
cuts based on previous studies, we identify and rank 2,974 RSG, 508 YSG, and 4,786 BSG candidates
in the LMC in six CMDs. The comparison between the CMDs of the LMC and SMC indicates that the most distinct
difference appears at the bright red end of the optical and near-infrared CMDs, where the cool evolved
stars (e.g., RSGs, AGB, and RGs) are located, which is likely due to the effect of metallicity and
SFH. Further quantitative comparison of colors of massive star candidates in equal absolute magnitude
bins suggests that, there is basically no difference for the BSG candidates, but large discrepancy
for the RSG candidates as LMC targets are redder than the SMC ones, which may be due to the combined
effect of metallicity on both spectral type and mass-loss rate, and also the age effect. The $T_{\rm
eff}$ of massive star populations are also derived from reddening-free color of $(J-K_{\rm S})_0$.
The $T_{\rm eff}$ ranges are $3500<T_{\rm eff}<5000$ K for RSG population, $5000<T_{\rm eff}<8000$
K for YSG population, and $T_{\rm eff}>8000$ K for BSG population, with larger uncertainties towards
the hotter stars.

Accurate phase diagrams of multicomponent plasmas are required for the modeling of dense stellar
plasmas, such as those found in the cores of white dwarf stars and the crusts of neutron stars. Those
phase diagrams have been computed using a variety of standard techniques, which suffer from physical
and computational limitations. Here, we present an efficient and accurate method that overcomes
the drawbacks of previously used approaches. In particular, finite-size effects are avoided as
each phase is calculated separately; the plasma electrons and volume changes are explicitly taken
into account; and arbitrary analytic fits to simulation data are avoided. Furthermore, no simulations
at uninteresting state conditions, i.e., away from the phase coexistence curves, are required,
which improves the efficiency of the technique. The method consists of an adaptation of the so-called
Gibbs-Duhem integration approach to electron-ion plasmas, where the coexistence curve is determined
by direct numerical integration of its underlying Clapeyron equation. The thermodynamics properties
of the coexisting phases are evaluated separately using Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric
semi-grand canonical ensemble. We describe this Monte Carlo-based Clapeyron integration method,
including its basic principles, our extension to electron-ion plasmas, and our numerical implementation.
We illustrate its applicability and benefits with the calculation of the melting curve of dense
C/O plasmas under conditions relevant for white dwarf cores and provide analytic fits to implement
this new melting curve in white dwarf models. While this work focuses on the liquid-solid phase boundary
of dense two-component plasmas, a wider range of physical systems and phase boundaries are within
the scope of the Clapeyron integration method, which had until now only been applied to simple model
systems of neutral particles.

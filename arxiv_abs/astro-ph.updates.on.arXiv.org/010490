To avoid known difficulties in planetesimal formation such as the drift or fragmentation barriers,
many scenarios have been proposed. However, in these scenarios, planetesimals form in general
only at some specific locations in protoplanetary discs. On the other hand, it is generally assumed
in planet formation models and population synthesis models, that planetesimals are broadly distributed
in the protoplanetary disc. Here we propose a new scenario in which planetesimals can form in broad
areas of the discs. Planetesimals form at the gas pressure bump formed by a first-generation planet
(e.g. formed by pebble accretion) and the formation region spreads inward in the disc as the planet
migrates. We use a simple 1D Lagrangian particle model to calculate the radial distribution of pebbles
in the gas disc perturbed by a migrating embedded planet. We consider that planetesimals form by
streaming instability at the points where the pebble-to-gas density ratio on the mid-plane becomes
larger than unity. We also study the effect of some key parameters like the ones of the gas disc model,
the pebble mass flux, the migration speed of the planet, and the strength of turbulence. We find that
planetesimals form in wide areas of the discs provided the flux of pebbles is typical and the turbulence
is not too strong. The planetesimal surface density depends on the pebble mass flux and the migration
speed of the planet. The total mass of the planetesimals and the orbital position of the formation
area depend strongly on the pebble mass flux. We also find that the profile of the planetesimal surface
density and its slope can be estimated by very simple equations. We show that our new scenario can
explain the formation of planetesimals in broad areas. The simple estimates we provide for the planetesimal
surface density profile can be used as initial conditions for population synthesis models.

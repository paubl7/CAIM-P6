Vortex flows can foster a variety of wave modes. A recent oscillatory analysis of a persistent 1.7
h vortex flow with a significant substructure has suggested the existence of various types of waves
within it. We investigate the nature and characteristics of waves within this quiet-Sun vortex
flow to better understand its physics and dynamics. We used a cross-wavelet spectral analysis between
pairs of Ha and Ca II 8542 intensity time series at different wavelengths and, hence, atmospheric
heights, acquired with CRISP/SST, as well as the derived Ha Doppler velocity and full width at half
maximum (FWHM) time series. We constructed halftone frequency-phase difference plots and investigated
the existence and propagation characteristics of different wave modes. Our analysis suggests
the existence of upwards propagating Alfvenic type waves with phase speeds of ~20-30 km/s. The dominant
wave mode seems to be the fast kink wave mode; however, our analysis also suggests the existence of
localised Alfvenic torsional waves related to the dynamics of individual chromospheric swirls
that characterise the substructure of the vortex flow. The Ha V-I phase difference analysis seems
to imply the existence of a standing wave pattern possibly arising from the interference of upwards
propagating kink waves with downwards propagating ones that are reflected at the transition region
or the corona. Moreover, the results provide further evidence that the central chromospheric swirl
drives the dynamics of the vortex flow. This is the first exhaustive phase difference analysis within
a vortex flow that explores the nature and dynamics of different wave modes within it. The questions,
however, of whether, and how, the dissipation of the derived wave modes occurs and if vortex flows
ultimately play a role in the energy budget of the upper layers of the solar atmosphere remain open.

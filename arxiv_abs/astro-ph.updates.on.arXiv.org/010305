We study the physical properties and behavior of the solar atmosphere during the GOES X1.6 solar
flare on 2014 September 10. The steady plasma flows and the fast sausage MHD waves were analysed with
the wavelet separation method. The magnetically coupled atmosphere and the forced magnetic field
reconnection were studied with the help of the Vertical-Current Approximation Non-linear Force-Free
Field code. We studied a mechanism of MHD wave transfer from the photosphere without dissipation
or reflection before reaching the corona and a mechanism of the wave energy distribution over the
solar corona. We report a common behavior of (extreme)ultraviolet steady plasma flows (speed of
15.3 -> 10.9 km/s) and fast sausage MHD waves (Alfven speed of 13.7 -> 10.3 km/s and characteristic
periods of 1 587 -> 1 607 s), propagating in cylindrical plasma waveguides of the individual atmospheric
layers (photosphere -> corona) observed by SDO/AIA/HMI and IRIS space instruments. A magnetically
coupled solar atmosphere by a magnetic field flux tube above a sunspot umbra and a magnetic field
reconnection forced by the waves were analysed. The solar seismology with trapped, leakage, and
tunnelled modes of the waves, dissipating especially in the solar corona, is discussed with respect
to its possible contribution to the outer atmosphere heating. We demonstrate that a dispersive
nature of fast sausage MHD waves, which can easily generate the leaky and other modes propagating
outside of their waveguide, and magnetic field flux tubes connecting the individual atmospheric
layers can distribute the magnetic field energy across the active region. This mechanism can contribute
to the coronal energy balance and to our knowledge on how the coronal heating is maintained.

One of the main discoveries from the first two orbits of Parker Solar Probe (PSP) was the presence
of magnetic switchbacks, whose deflections dominated the magnetic field measurements. Determining
their shape and size could provide evidence of their origin, which is still unclear. Previous work
with a single solar wind stream has indicated that these are long, thin structures although the direction
of their major axis could not be determined. We investigate if this long, thin nature extends to other
solar wind streams, while determining the direction along which the switchbacks within a stream
were aligned. We try to understand how the size and orientation of the switchbacks, along with the
flow velocity and spacecraft trajectory, combine to produce the observed structure durations
for past and future orbits. We searched for the alignment direction that produced a combination
of a spacecraft cutting direction and switchback duration that was most consistent with long, thin
structures. The expected form of a long, thin structure was fitted to the results of the best alignment
direction, which determined the width and aspect ratio of the switchbacks for that stream. The switchbacks
had a mean width of $50,000 \, \rm{km}$, with an aspect ratio of the order of $10$. We find that switchbacks
are not aligned along the background flow direction, but instead aligned along the local Parker
spiral, perhaps suggesting that they propagate along the magnetic field. Since the observed switchback
duration depends on how the spacecraft cuts through the structure, the duration alone cannot be
used to determine the size or influence of an individual event. For future PSP orbits, a larger spacecraft
transverse component combined with more radially aligned switchbacks will lead to long duration
switchbacks becoming less common.

Here we explore the efficiency and fidelity of a purely astrometric selection of quasars as point
sources with zero proper motions in the {\it Gaia} data release 2 (DR2). We have built a complete candidate
sample including 104 Gaia-DR2 point sources brighter than $G<20$ mag within one degree of the north
Galactic pole (NGP), all with proper motions consistent with zero within 2$\sigma$ uncertainty.
In addition to pre-existing spectra, we have secured long-slit spectroscopy of all the remaining
candidates and find that all 104 stationary point sources in the field can be classified as either
quasars (63) or stars (41). The selection efficiency of the zero-proper-motion criterion at high
Galactic latitudes is thus $\approx 60\%$. Based on this complete quasar sample we examine the basic
properties of the underlying quasar population within the imposed limiting magnitude. We find
that the surface density of quasars is 20 deg$^{-2}$, the redshift distribution peaks at $z\sim1.5$,
and that only eight systems ($13^{+5}_{-3}\%$) show significant dust reddening. We then explore
the selection efficiency of commonly used optical, near- and mid-infrared quasar identification
techniques and find that they are all complete at the $85-90\%$ level compared to the astrometric
selection. Finally, we discuss how the astrometric selection can be improved to an efficiency of
$\approx70\%$ by including an additional cut requiring parallaxes of the candidates to be consistent
with zero within 2$\sigma$. The selection efficiency will further increase with the release of
future, more sensitive astrometric measurement from the Gaia mission. This type of selection,
purely based on the astrometry of the quasar candidates, is unbiased in terms of colours and emission
mechanisms of the quasars and thus provides the most complete census of the quasar population within
the limiting magnitude of Gaia.

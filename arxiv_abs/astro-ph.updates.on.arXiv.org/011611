Recently detected coherent low-frequency radio emission from M dwarf systems shares phenomenological
similarities with emission produced by magnetospheric processes from the gas giant planets of
our Solar System. Such beamed electron-cyclotron maser emission can be driven by a star-planet
interaction or a breakdown in co-rotation between a rotating plasma disk and a stellar magnetosphere.
Both models suggest that the radio emission could be periodic. Here we present the longest low-frequency
interferometric monitoring campaign of an M dwarf system, composed of twenty-one $\approx$8 hour
epochs taken in two series of observing blocks separated by a year. We achieved a total on-source
time of 6.5 days. We show that the M dwarf binary CR Draconis has a low-frequency 3$\sigma$ detection
rate of 90$^{+5}_{-8}$% when a noise floor of $\approx$0.1 mJy is reached, with a median flux density
of 0.92 mJy, consistent circularly polarised handedness, and a median circularly polarised fraction
of 66%. We resolve three bright radio bursts in dynamic spectra, revealing the brightest is elliptically
polarised, confined to 4 MHz of bandwidth centred on 170 MHz, and reaches a flux density of 205 mJy.
The burst structure is mottled, indicating it consists of unresolved sub-bursts. Such a structure
shares a striking resemblance with the low-frequency emission from Jupiter. We suggest the near-constant
detection of high brightness temperature, highly-circularly-polarised radiation that has a
consistent circular polarisation handedness implies the emission is produced via the electron-cyclotron
maser instability. Optical photometric data reveal the system has a rotation period of 1.984$\pm$0.003
days. We observe no periodicity in the radio data, but the sampling of our radio observations produces
a window function that would hide the near two-day signal.

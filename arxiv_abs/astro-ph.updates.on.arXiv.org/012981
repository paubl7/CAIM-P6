Observations suggest a power-law relation between the coronal emission in X-rays, $L_{\rm{X}}$,
and the total (unsigned) magnetic flux at the stellar surface, $\Phi$. The physics basis for this
relation is poorly understood. We use three-dimensional (3D) magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) numerical
models of the coronae above active regions, that is, strong concentrations of magnetic field, to
investigate the $L_{\rm{X}}$ versus $\Phi$ relation and illustrate this relation with an analytical
model based on simple well-established scaling relations. In the 3D MHD model horizontal (convective)
motions near the surface induce currents in the coronal magnetic field that are dissipated and heat
the plasma. This self-consistently creates a corona with a temperature of 1 MK. We run a series of
models that differ in terms of the (unsigned) magnetic flux at the surface by changing the (peak)
magnetic field strength while keeping all other parameters fixed. In the 3D MHD models we find that
the energy input into the corona, characterized by either the Poynting flux or the total volumetric
heating, scales roughly quadratically with the unsigned surface flux $\Phi$. This is expected
from heating through field-line braiding. Our central result is the nonlinear scaling of the X-ray
emission as $L_{\rm{X}}\propto \Phi^{3.44}$. This scaling is slightly steeper than found in recent
observations that give power-law indices of up to only 2 or 3. Assuming that on a real star, not only
the peak magnetic field strength in the active regions changes but also their number (or surface
filling factor), our results are consistent with observations. Our model provides indications
of what causes the steep increase in X-ray luminosity by four orders of magnitude from solar-type
activity to fast rotating active stars.

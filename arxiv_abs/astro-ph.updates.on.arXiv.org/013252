We study the radio spectral properties of 2,094 star-forming galaxies (SFGs) by combining our early
science data from the MeerKAT International GHz Tiered Extragalactic Exploration (MIGHTEE) survey
with VLA, GMRT radio data, and rich ancillary data in the COSMOS field. These SFGs are selected at
VLA 3GHz, and their flux densities from MeerKAT 1.3GHz and GMRT 325MHz imaging data are extracted
using the "super-deblending" technique. The median radio spectral index is $\alpha_{\rm 1.3GHz}^{\rm
3GHz}=-0.80\pm0.01$ without significant variation across the rest-frame frequencies ~1.3-10GHz,
indicating radio spectra dominated by synchrotron radiation. On average, the radio spectrum at
observer-frame 1.3-3GHz slightly steepens with increasing stellar mass with a linear fitted slope
of $\beta=-0.08\pm0.01$, which could be explained by age-related synchrotron losses. Due to the
sensitivity of GMRT 325MHz data, we apply a further flux density cut at 3GHz ($S_{\rm 3GHz}\ge50\,\mu$Jy)
and obtain a sample of 166 SFGs with measured flux densities at 325MHz, 1.3GHz, and 3GHz. On average,
the radio spectrum of SFGs flattens at low frequency with the median spectral indices of $\alpha^{\rm
1.3GHz}_{\rm 325MHz}=-0.59^{+0.02}_{-0.03}$ and $\alpha^{\rm 3.0GHz}_{\rm 1.3GHz}=-0.74^{+0.01}_{-0.02}$.
At low frequency, our stacking analyses show that the radio spectrum also slightly steepens with
increasing stellar mass. By comparing the far-infrared-radio correlations of SFGs based on different
radio spectral indices, we find that adopting $\alpha_{\rm 1.3GHz}^{\rm 3GHz}$ for $k$-corrections
will significantly underestimate the infrared-to-radio luminosity ratio ($q_{\rm IR}$) for
>17% of the SFGs with measured flux density at the three radio frequencies in our sample, because
their radio spectra are significantly flatter at low frequency (0.33-1.3GHz).

We present an analysis of the chemical abundance properties of $\approx$650 star-forming galaxies
at $z \approx0.6-1.8$. Using integral-field observations from the $K$-band Multi-Object Spectrograph
(KMOS), we quantify the [NII]/H$\alpha$ emission-line ratio, a proxy for the gas-phase Oxygen
abundance within the interstellar medium. We define the stellar mass-metallicity relation at
$z \approx0.6-1.0$ and $z \approx1.2-1.8$ and analyse the correlation between the scatter in the
relation and fundamental galaxy properties (e.g. H$\alpha$ star-formation rate, H$\alpha$ specific
star-formation rate, rotation dominance, stellar continuum half-light radius and Hubble-type
morphology). We find that for a given stellar mass, more highly star-forming, larger and irregular
galaxies have lower gas-phase metallicities, which may be attributable to their lower surface
mass densities and the higher gas fractions of irregular systems. We measure the radial dependence
of gas-phase metallicity in the galaxies, establishing a median, beam smearing-corrected, metallicity
gradient of $ \Delta Z/ \Delta R=0.002 \pm0.004$ dex kpc$^{-1}$, indicating on average there is
no significant dependence on radius. The metallicity gradient of a galaxy is independent of its
rest-frame optical morphology, whilst correlating with its stellar mass and specific star-formation
rate, in agreement with an inside-out model of galaxy evolution, as well as its rotation dominance.
We quantify the evolution of metallicity gradients, comparing the distribution of $\Delta Z/ \Delta
R$ in our sample with numerical simulations and observations at $z \approx0-3$. Galaxies in our
sample exhibit flatter metallicity gradients than local star-forming galaxies, in agreement
with numerical models in which stellar feedback plays a crucial role redistributing metals.

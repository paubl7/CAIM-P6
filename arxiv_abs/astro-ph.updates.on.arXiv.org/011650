We study protostellar envelope and outflow evolution using Hubble Space Telescope NICMOS or WFC3
images of 304 protostars in the Orion Molecular clouds. These near-IR images resolve structures
in the envelopes delineated by the scattered light of the central protostars with 80 AU resolution
and they complement the 1.2-870 micron spectral energy distributions obtained with the Herschel
Orion Protostar Survey program (HOPS). Based on their 1.60 micron morphologies, we classify the
protostars into five categories: non-detections, point sources without nebulosity, bipolar
cavity sources, unipolar cavity sources, and irregulars. We find point sources without associated
nebulosity are the most numerous, and show through monochromatic Monte Carlo radiative transfer
modeling that this morphology occurs when protostars are observed at low inclinations or have low
envelope densities. We also find that the morphology is correlated with the SED-determined evolutionary
class with Class 0 protostars more likely to be non-detections, Class I protostars to show cavities
and flat-spectrum protostars to be point sources. Using an edge detection algorithm to trace the
projected edges of the cavities, we fit power-laws to the resulting cavity shapes, thereby measuring
the cavity half-opening angles and power-law exponents. We find no evidence for the growth of outflow
cavities as protostars evolve through the Class I protostar phase, in contradiction with previous
studies of smaller samples. We conclude that the decline of mass infall with time cannot be explained
by the progressive clearing of envelopes by growing outflow cavities. Furthermore, the low star
formation efficiency inferred for molecular cores cannot be explained by envelope clearing alone.

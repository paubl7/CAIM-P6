The Ariel mission will observe spectroscopically around 1000 exoplanets to further characterise
their atmospheres. For the mission to be as efficient as possible, a good knowledge of the planets'
ephemerides is needed before its launch in 2028. While ephemerides for some planets are being refined
on a per-case basis, an organised effort to collectively verify or update them when necessary does
not exist. In this study, we introduce the ExoClock project, an open, integrated and interactive
platform with the purpose of producing a confirmed list of ephemerides for the planets that will
be observed by Ariel. The project has been developed in a manner to make the best use of all available
resources: observations reported in the literature, observations from space instruments and,
mainly, observations from ground-based telescopes, including both professional and amateur
observatories. To facilitate inexperienced observers and at the same time achieve homogeneity
in the results, we created data collection and validation protocols, educational material and
easy to use interfaces, open to everyone. ExoClock was launched in September 2019 and now counts
over 140 participants from more than 15 countries around the world. In this release, we report the
results of observations obtained until the 15h of April 2020 for 119 Ariel candidate targets. In
total, 632 observations were used to either verify or update the ephemerides of 83 planets. Additionally,
we developed the Exoplanet Characterisation Catalogue (ECC), a catalogue built in a consistent
way to assist the ephemeris refinement process. So far, the collaborative open framework of the
ExoClock project has proven to be highly efficient in coordinating scientific efforts involving
diverse audiences. Therefore, we believe that it is a paradigm that can be applied in the future for
other research purposes, too.

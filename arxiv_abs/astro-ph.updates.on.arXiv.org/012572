Cosmological constraints of Modified Gravity (MG) models are seldom carried out rigorously. First,
even though general MG models evolve differently (i.e., background and perturbations) to the standard
cosmological model, it is usual to assume a $\Lambda$CDM background. This treatment is not correct
and in the era of precision cosmology could induce undesired biases in cosmological parameters.
Second, neutrino mass is usually held fixed in the analyses which could obscure its relation to MG
parameters. In a couple of previous papers we showed that by using the Effective Fluid Approach we
can accurately compute observables in fairly general MG models. An appealing advantage of our approach
is that it allows a pretty easy implementation of this kinds of models in Boltzmann solvers (i.e.,
less error--prone) while having a useful analytical description of the effective fluid to understand
the underlying physics. This paper illustrates how an effective fluid approach can be used to carry
out proper analyses of cosmological constraints in MG models. We investigated three MG models including
the sum of neutrino masses as a varying parameter in our Markov Chain Monte Carlo analyses. Two models
(i.e., Designer $f(R)$ [DES-fR] and Designer Horndeski [HDES]) have a background matching $\Lambda$CDM,
while in a third model (i.e., Hu $\&$ Sawicki $f(R)$ model [HS]) the background differs from the standard
model. In this way we estimate how relevant the background is when constraining MG parameters along
with neutrinos' masses. We implement the models in the popular Boltzmann solver CLASS and use recent,
available data (i.e., Planck 2018, CMB lensing, BAO, SNIa Pantheon compilation, $H_0$ from SHOES,
and RSD Gold-18 compilation) to compute tight cosmological constraints in the MG parameters that
account for deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model. [abridged]

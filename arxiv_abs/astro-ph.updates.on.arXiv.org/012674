We present results on the nature of extreme ejective feedback episodes and the physical conditions
of a population of massive ($\rm M_* \sim 10^{11} M_{\odot}$), compact starburst galaxies at z =
0.4-0.7. We use data from Keck/NIRSPEC, SDSS, Gemini/GMOS, MMT, and Magellan/MagE to measure rest-frame
optical and near-IR spectra of 14 starburst galaxies with extremely high star formation rate surface
densities (mean $\rm \Sigma_{SFR} \sim 3000 \,M_{\odot} yr^{-1} kpc^{-2}$) and powerful galactic
outflows (maximum speeds v$_{98} \sim$ 1000-3000 km s$^{-1}$). Our unique data set includes an
ensemble of both emission [OII]$\lambda\lambda$3726,3729, H$\beta$, [OIII]$\lambda\lambda$4959,5007,
H$\alpha$, [NII]$\lambda\lambda$6548,6583, and [SII]$\lambda\lambda$6716,6731) and absorption
MgII$\lambda\lambda$2796,2803, and FeII$\lambda$2586) lines that allow us to investigate the
kinematics of the cool gas phase (T$\sim$10$^4$ K) in the outflows. Employing a suite of line ratio
diagnostic diagrams, we find that the central starbursts are characterized by high electron densities
(median n$_e \sim$ 530 cm$^{-3}$), high metallicity (solar or super-solar), and, on average, high
ionization parameters. We show that the outflows are most likely driven by stellar feedback emerging
from the extreme central starburst, rather than by an AGN. We also present multiple intriguing observational
signatures suggesting that these galaxies may have substantial Lyman continuum (LyC) photon leakage,
including weak [SII] nebular emission lines. Our results imply that these galaxies may be captured
in a short-lived phase of extreme star formation and feedback where much of their gas is violently
blown out by powerful outflows that open up channels for LyC photons to escape.

We present TransitFit, an open-source Python~3 package designed to fit exoplanetary transit light-curves
for transmission spectroscopy studies (Available at https://github.com/joshjchayes/TransitFit
and https://github.com/spearnet/TransitFit, with documentation at https://transitfit.readthedocs.io/).
TransitFit employs nested sampling to offer efficient and robust multi-epoch, multi-wavelength
fitting of transit data obtained from one or more telescopes. TransitFit allows per-telescope
detrending to be performed simultaneously with parameter fitting, including the use of user-supplied
detrending alogorithms. Host limb darkening can be fitted either independently ("uncoupled")
for each filter or combined ("coupled") using prior conditioning from the PHOENIX stellar atmosphere
models. For this TransitFit uses the Limb Darkening Toolkit (LDTk) together with filter profiles,
including user-supplied filter profiles. We demonstrate the application of TransitFit in three
different contexts. First, we model SPEARNET broadband optical data of the low-density hot-Neptune
WASP-127~b. The data were obtained from a globally-distributed network of 0.5m--2.4m telescopes.
We find clear improvement in our broadband results using the coupled mode over uncoupled mode, when
compared against the higher spectral resolution GTC/OSIRIS transmission spectrum obtained by
Chen et al. (2018). Using TransitFit, we fit 26 transit observations by TESS to recover improved
ephemerides of the hot-Jupiter WASP-91~b and a transit depth determined to a precision of 170~ppm.
Finally, we use TransitFit to conduct an investigation into the contested presence of TTV signatures
in WASP-126~b using 126 transits observed by TESS, concluding that there is no statistically significant
evidence for such signatures from observations spanning 31 TESS sectors.

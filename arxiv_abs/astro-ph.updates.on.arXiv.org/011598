Context. Supermassive black holes in the centres of radio-loud active galactic nuclei (AGN) can
produce collimated relativistic outflows (jets). Magnetic fields are thought to play a key role
in the formation and collimation of these jets, but the details are much debated. Aims. We study the
innermost jet morphology and magnetic field strength in the AGN 3C 345 with an unprecedented resolution
using images obtained within the framework of the key science programme on AGN polarisation of the
Space VLBI mission RadioAstron. Methods. We observed the flat spectrum radio quasar 3C 345 at 1.6
GHz on 2016 March 30 with RadioAstron and 18 ground-based radio telescopes in full polarisation
mode. Results. Our images, in both total intensity and linear polarisation, reveal a complex jet
structure at 300 $\mu$as angular resolution, corresponding to a projected linear scale of about
2 pc or a few thousand gravitational radii. We identify the synchrotron self-absorbed core at the
jet base and find the brightest feature in the jet 1.5 mas downstream of the core. Several polarised
components appear in the Space VLBI images that cannot be seen from ground array-only images. Except
for the core, the electric vector position angles follow the local jet direction, suggesting a magnetic
field perpendicular to the jet. This indicates the presence of plane perpendicular shocks in these
regions. Additionally, we infer a minimum brightness temperature at the largest $(u,v)$-distances
of $1.1\times 10^{12}$ K in the source frame, which is above the inverse Compton limit and an order
of magnitude larger than the equipartition value. This indicates locally efficient injection
or re-acceleration of particles in the jet to counter the inverse Compton cooling or the geometry
of the jet creates significant changes in the Doppler factor, which has to be $>11$ to explain the
high brightness temperatures.

(Abridged) Herbig Ae/Be stars (HAeBes) have so far been studied based on relatively small samples
that are scattered throughout the sky. Their fundamental stellar and circumstellar parameters
and statistical properties were derived with heterogeneous approaches before Gaia. Our main goal
is to contribute to the study of HAeBes from the largest sample of such sources to date, for which stellar
and circumstellar properties have been determined homogeneously from the analysis of the spectral
energy distributions (SEDs) and Gaia EDR3 parallaxes and photometry. Multiwavelength photometry
was compiled for 209 bona fide HAeBes for which Gaia EDR3 distances were estimated. Using the Virtual
Observatory SED Analyser (VOSA), photospheric models were fit to the optical SEDs to derive stellar
parameters, and the excesses at infrared (IR) and longer wavelengths were characterized to derive
several circumstellar properties. The stellar temperature, luminosity, radius, mass, and age
were derived for each star based on optical photometry. In addition, their IR SEDs were classified
according to two different schemes, and their mass accretion rates, disk masses, and the sizes of
the inner dust holes were also estimated uniformly. The initial mass function fits the stellar mass
distribution of the sample within 2 < M_star/M_sun < 12. In this aspect, the sample is therefore representative
of the HAeBe regime and can be used for statistical purposes when it is taken into account that the
boundaries are not well probed. A statistical analysis was carried out mainly focused on the different
circumstellar properties of Herbig Ae (HAe) and Be (HBe) stars. The complete dataset is available
online through a Virtual Observatory-compliant archive, representing the most recent reference
for statistical studies on the HAeBe regime.

New mass-produced, wide-field, small-aperture telescopes have the potential to revolutionize
ground-based astronomy by greatly reducing the cost of collecting area. In this paper, we introduce
a new class of large telescope based on these advances: an all-sky, arcsecond-resolution, 1000-telescope
array which builds a simultaneously high-cadence and deep survey by observing the entire sky all
night. As a concrete example, we describe the Argus Array, a 5m-class telescope with an all-sky field
of view and the ability to reach extremely high cadences using low-noise CMOS detectors. Each 55
GPix Argus exposure covers 20% of the entire sky to g=19.6 each minute and g=21.9 each hour; a high-speed
mode will allow sub-second survey cadences for short times. Deep coadds will reach g=23.6 every
five nights over 47% of the sky; a larger-aperture array telescope, with an \'etendue close to the
Rubin Observatory, could reach g=24.3 in five nights. These arrays can build two-color, million-epoch
movies of the sky, enabling sensitive and rapid searches for high-speed transients, fast-radio-burst
counterparts, gravitational-wave counterparts, exoplanet microlensing events, occultations
by distant solar system bodies, and myriad other phenomena. An array of O(1,000) telescopes, however,
would be one of the most complex astronomical instruments yet built. Standard arrays with hundreds
of tracking mounts entail thousands of moving parts and exposed optics, and maintenance costs would
rapidly outpace the mass-produced-hardware cost savings compared to a monolithic large telescope.
We discuss how to greatly reduce operations costs by placing all optics in a thermally controlled,
sealed dome with a single moving part. Coupled with careful software scope control and use of existing
pipelines, we show that the Argus Array could become the deepest and fastest Northern sky survey,
with total costs below $20M.

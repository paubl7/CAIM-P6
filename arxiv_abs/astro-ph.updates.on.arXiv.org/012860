In this work we investigate the standard deviation of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature
gradient field as a signature for a multiply connected nature of the Universe. CMB simulations of
a spatially infinite universe model within the paradigm of the standard cosmological model present
non-zero two-point correlations at any angular scale. This is in contradiction with the extreme
suppression of correlations at scales above $60^{\circ}$ in the observed CMB maps. Universe models
with spatially multiply connected topology contain typically a discrete spectrum of the Laplacian
with a specific wave-length cut-off and thus lead to a suppression of the correlations at large angular
scales, as observed in the CMB (in general there can be also an additional continuous spectrum).
Among the simplest examples are 3-dimensional tori which possess only a discrete spectrum. To date,
the universe models with non-trivial topology such as the toroidal space are the only models that
possess a two-point correlation function showing a similar behaviour as the one derived from the
observed Planck CMB maps. In this work it is shown that the normalized standard deviation of the CMB
temperature gradient field does hierarchically detect the change in size of the cubic 3-torus.
It is also shown that the variance of the temperature gradient of the Planck maps is in slight anomaly
with the median value of simulations within the standard cosmological model. All flat tori are globally
homogeneous, but are globally anisotropic. However, this study also presents a test showing a level
of homogeneity and isotropy of all the CMB map ensembles for the different torus sizes considered
that are nearly at the same weak level of anisotropy revealed by the CMB in the standard cosmological
model.

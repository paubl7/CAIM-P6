Observations of reionization-era analogs at $z\sim3$ are a powerful tool for constraining reionization.
Rest-ultraviolet observations are particularly useful, in which both direct and indirect tracers
of ionizing-photon production and escape can be observed. We analyse a sample of 124 $z\sim3$ galaxies
from the Keck Lyman Continuum Spectroscopic Survey, with sensitive spectroscopic measurements
of the Lyman continuum region. We present a method of removing foreground contamination from our
sample using high-resolution, multi-band Hubble Space Telescope imaging. We re-measure the global
properties of the cleaned sample of 13 individually-detected Lyman continuum sources and 107 individually-undetected
sources, including a sample-averaged absolute escape fraction of $f_{\rm esc,abs}=0.06\pm0.01$
and a sample-averaged ratio of ionizing to non-ionizing ultraviolet flux density of $<f_{900}/f_{1500}>_{\rm
out}=0.040\pm0.006$, corrected for attenuation from the intergalactic and circumgalactic media.
Based on composite spectra, we also recover a strong positive correlation between $<f_{900}/f_{1500}>_{\rm
out}$ and Ly$\alpha$ equivalent width (W$_\lambda$(Ly$\alpha$)) and a negative correlation
between $<f_{900}/f_{1500}>_{\rm out}$ and UV luminosity. As in previous work, we interpret the
relationship between $<f_{900}/f_{1500}>_{\rm out}$ and W$_\lambda$(Ly$\alpha$) in terms
of the modulation of the escape of ionizing radiation from star-forming galaxies based on the covering
fraction of neutral gas. We also use a W$_\lambda$(Ly$\alpha$)-weighted $<f_{900}/f_{1500}>_{\rm
out}$ to estimate an ionizing emissivity from star-forming galaxies at $z\sim3$ as $\epsilon_{\rm
LyC}\simeq5.5\times10^{24}$erg s$^{-1}$ Hz$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-3}$. This estimate, evaluated using
the uncontaminated sample of this work, reaffirms that galaxies provide the majority of the ionizing
background at $z\sim3$ and beyond.

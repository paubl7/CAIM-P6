[Abridged] An increasing number of astronomical instruments (on Earth and space-based) provide
hyperspectral images, that is three-dimensional data cubes with two spatial dimensions and one
spectral dimension. The intrinsic limitation in spatial resolution of these instruments implies
that the spectra associated with pixels of such images are most often mixtures of the spectra of the
"pure" components that exist in the considered region. In order to estimate the spectra and spatial
abundances of these pure components, we here propose an original blind signal separation (BSS),
that is to say an unsupervised unmixing method. Our approach is based on extensions and combinations
of linear BSS methods that belong to two major classes of methods, namely nonnegative matrix factorization
(NMF) and Sparse Component Analysis (SCA). The former performs the decomposition of hyperspectral
images, as a set of pure spectra and abundance maps, by using nonnegativity constraints, but the
estimated solution is not unique: It highly depends on the initialization of the algorithm. The
considered SCA methods are based on the assumption of the existence of points or tiny spatial zones
where only one source is active (i.e., one pure component is present). In real conditions, the assumption
of perfect single-source points or zones is not always realistic. In such conditions, SCA yields
approximate versions of the unknown sources and mixing coefficients. We propose to use part of these
preliminary estimates from the SCA to initialize several runs of the NMF to constrain the convergence
of the NMF algorithm. Detailed tests with synthetic data show that the decomposition achieved with
such hybrid methods is nearly unique and provides good performance, illustrating the potential
of applications to real data.

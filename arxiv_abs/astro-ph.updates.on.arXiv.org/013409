The Q $\&$ U Bolometric Interferometer for Cosmology (QUBIC) is a novel kind of polarimeter optimized
for the measurement of the B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), which
is one of the major challenges of observational cosmology. The signal is expected to be of the order
of a few tens of nK, prone to instrumental systematic effects and polluted by various astrophysical
foregrounds which can only be controlled through multichroic observations. QUBIC is designed
to address these observational issues with a novel approach that combines the advantages of interferometry
in terms of control of instrumental systematic effects with those of bolometric detectors in terms
of wide-band, background-limited sensitivity. The QUBIC synthesized beam has a frequency-dependent
shape that results in the ability to produce maps of the CMB polarization in multiple sub-bands within
the two physical bands of the instrument (150 and 220 GHz). These features make QUBIC complementary
to other instruments and makes it particularly well suited to characterize and remove Galactic
foreground contamination. In this article, first of a series of eight, we give an overview of the
QUBIC instrument design, the main results of the calibration campaign, and present the scientific
program of QUBIC including not only the measurement of primordial B-modes, but also the measurement
of Galactic foregrounds. We give forecasts for typical observations and measurements: with three
years of integration on the sky and assuming perfect foreground removal as well as stable atmospheric
conditions from our site in Argentina, our simulations show that we can achieve a statistical sensitivity
to the effective tensor-to-scalar ratio (including primordial and foreground B-modes) $\sigma(r)=0.015$.

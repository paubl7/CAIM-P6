The full-phase infrared light curves of low-eccentricity hot Jupiters show a trend of increasing
fractional dayside-nightside brightness temperature difference with increasing incident stellar
flux, both averaged across the infrared and in each individual wavelength band. The analytic theory
of Komacek & Showman (2016) shows that this trend is due to the decreasing ability with increasing
incident stellar flux of waves to propagate from day to night and erase temperature differences.
Here, we compare the predictions of this theory to observations, showing that it explains well the
shape of the trend of increasing dayside-nightside temperature difference with increasing equilibrium
temperature. Applied to individual planets, the theory matches well with observations at high
equilibrium temperatures but, for a fixed photosphere pressure of $100 \ \mathrm{mbar}$, systematically
under-predicts the dayside-nightside brightness temperature differences at equilibrium temperatures
less than $2000 \ \mathrm{K}$. We interpret this as due to as the effects of a process that moves the
infrared photospheres of these cooler hot Jupiters to lower pressures. We also utilize general
circulation modeling with double-grey radiative transfer to explore how the circulation changes
with equilibrium temperature and drag strengths. As expected from our theory, the dayside-nightside
temperature differences from our numerical simulations increase with increasing incident stellar
flux and drag strengths. We calculate model phase curves using our general circulation models,
from which we compare the broadband infrared offset from the substellar point and dayside-nightside
brightness temperature differences against observations, finding that strong drag or additional
effects (e.g. clouds and/or supersolar metallicities) are necessary to explain many observed
phase curves.

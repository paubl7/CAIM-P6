We present ALMA and VLA spatial maps of the Uranian atmosphere taken between 2015 and 2018 at wavelengths
from 1.3 mm to 10 cm, probing pressures from $\sim$1 to $\sim$50 bar at spatial resolutions from 0.1''
to 0.8''. Radiative transfer modeling was performed to determine the physical origin of the brightness
variations across Uranus's disk. The radio-dark equator and midlatitudes of the planet (south
of $\sim$50$^\circ$ N) are well fit by a deep H$_2$S mixing ratio of $8.7_{-1.5}^{+3.1}\times10^{-4}$
($37_{-6}^{+13}\times$ Solar) and a deep NH$_3$ mixing ratio of $1.7_{-0.4}^{+0.7}\times10^{-4}$
($1.4_{-0.3}^{+0.5}\times$ Solar), in good agreement with literature models of Uranus's disk-averaged
spectrum. The north polar region is very bright at all frequencies northward of $\sim$50$^\circ$N,
which we attribute to strong depletions extending down to the NH$_4$SH layer in both NH$_3$ and H$_2$S
relative to the equatorial region; the model is consistent with an NH$_3$ abundance of $4.7_{-1.8}^{+2.1}
\times 10^{-7}$ and an H$_2$S abundance of $<$$1.9\times10^{-7}$ between $\sim$20 and $\sim$50
bar. Combining this observed depletion in condensible molecules with methane-sensitive near-infrared
observations from the literature suggests large-scale downwelling in the north polar vortex region
from $\sim$0.1 to $\sim$50 bar. The highest-resolution maps reveal zonal radio-dark and radio-bright
bands at 20$^\circ$S, 0$^\circ$, and 20$^\circ$N, as well as zonal banding within the north polar
region. The difference in brightness is a factor of $\sim$10 less pronounced in these bands than
the difference between the north pole and equator, and additional observations are required to
determine the temperature, composition and vertical extent of these features.

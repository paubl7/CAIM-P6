There is a class of binary post-AGB stars with a remarkable near-infrared excess that are surrounded
by Keplerian or quasi-Keplerian disks and extended outflows composed of gas escaping from the disk.
The Keplerian dynamics had been well identified in four cases, namely the Red Rectangle, AC Her,
IW Car, and IRAS 08544-4431. In these objects, the mass of the outflow represents ~ 10 % of the nebular
mass, the disk being the dominant component of the nebula. We present interferometric NOEMA maps
of 12CO and 13CO J=2-1 in 89 Her and 12CO J=2-1 in AC Her, IRAS 19125+0343, and R Sct. Several properties
of the nebula are obtained from the data and model fitting, including the structure, density, and
temperature distributions, as well as the dynamics. We also discuss the uncertainties on the derived
values. The presence of an expanding component in AC Her is doubtful, but thanks to new maps and models,
we estimate an upper limit to the mass of this outflow of < 3 10^-5 Mo, that is, the mass of the outflow
is < 5 % of the total nebular mass. For 89 Her, we find a total nebular mass of 1.4 10^-2 Mo, of which ~ 50
% comes from an hourglass-shaped extended outflow. In the case of IRAS 19125+0343, the nebular mass
is 1.1 10^-2 Mo, where the outflow contributes ~ 70 % of the total mass. The nebular mass of R Sct is 3.2
10^-2 Mo, of which ~ 75 % corresponds to a very extended outflow that surrounds the disk. Our results
for IRAS 19125+0343 and R Sct lead us to introduce a new subclass of binary post-AGB stars, for which
the outflow is the dominant component of the nebula. Moreover, the outflow mass fraction found in
AC Her is smaller than those found in other disk-dominated binary post-AGB stars. 89 Her would represent
an intermediate case between both subclasses.

Coronal mass ejections (CME) occur when long-lived magnetic flux ropes (MFR) anchored to the solar
surface destabilize and erupt away from the Sun. This destabilization is often described in terms
of an ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) instability called the torus instability. It occurs when
the external magnetic field decreases sufficiently fast such that its decay index, $n=-z\,\partial\,(\ln
B)/\partial z$ is larger than a critical value, $n>n_{\rm cr}$, where $n_{\rm cr}=1.5$ for a full,
large aspect ratio torus. However, when this is applied to solar MFRs, a range of conflicting values
for $n_{\rm cr}$ is found in the literature. To investigate this discrepancy, we have conducted
laboratory experiments on arched, line-tied flux ropes and have applied a theoretical model of
the torus instability. Our model describes an MFR as a partial torus with footpoints anchored in
a conducting surface and numerically calculates various magnetic forces on it. This calculation
yields a better prediction of $n_{\rm cr}$ which takes into account the specific parameters of the
MFR. We describe a systematic methodology to properly translate laboratory results to their solar
counterparts, provided that the MFRs have sufficiently small edge safety factor, or equivalently,
large enough twist. After this translation, our model predicts that $n_{\rm cr}$ in solar conditions
often falls near $n_{\rm cr}^{\rm Sol}\sim0.9$ and within a larger range of $n_{\rm cr}^{\rm Sol}\sim(0.7,1.2)$
depending on the parameters. The methodology of translating laboratory MFRs to their solar counterparts
enables quantitative investigations of the initiation of CMEs through laboratory experiments.
These experiments allow for new physics insights that are required for better predictions of space
weather events but are difficult to obtain otherwise.

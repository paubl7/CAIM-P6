Solar Orbiter observed an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME) event at 0.8 AU on 2020 April
19. The ICME was also observed by Wind at 1 AU on 2020 April 20. An interplanetary shock wave was driven
in front of the ICME. We focus on the transmission of the magnetic fluctuations across the shock and
analyze the characteristic wave modes of solar wind turbulence near the shock observed by both spacecraft.
The ICME event is characterized by a magnetic helicity based technique. The shock normal is determined
by magnetic coplanarity method for Solar Orbiter and using a mixed coplanarity approach for Wind.
The power spectra of magnetic field fluctuations are generated by applying both a fast Fourier transform
and Morlet wavelet analysis. To understand the nature of waves observed near the shock, we use the
normalized magnetic helicity as a diagnostic parameter. The wavelet reconstructed magnetic field
fluctuation hodograms are used to further study the polarization properties of waves. We find that
the ICME-driven shock observed by Solar Orbiter and Wind is a fast forward oblique shock with a more
perpendicular shock angle at 1 AU. After the shock crossing, the magnetic field fluctuation power
increases. Most of the magnetic field fluctuation power resides in the transverse fluctuations.
In the vicinity of the shock, both spacecraft observe right-hand polarized waves in the spacecraft
frame. The upstream wave signatures fall in a relatively broad and low-frequency band, which might
be attributed to low-frequency MHD waves excited by the streaming particles. For the downstream
magnetic wave activity, we find oblique kinetic Alfven waves with frequencies near the proton cyclotron
frequency in the spacecraft frame. The frequency of the downstream waves increases by a factor of
7-10 due to the shock compression and the Doppler effect.

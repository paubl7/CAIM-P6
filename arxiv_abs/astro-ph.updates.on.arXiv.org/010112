Aim. We investigate synthetic observational signatures generated from numerical models of transverse
waves propagating in braided magnetic fields. Methods. We examine two simulations with different
levels of magnetic field braiding and impose a periodic, transverse wave driver at the lower boundary.
After waves reflect off the top boundary, a complex pattern of wave interference forms. We analyse
the synthetic emission produced by the forward modelling code, FoMo. We examine line intensity,
Doppler shifts and kinetic energy along several line-of-sight (LOS) angles. Results. The Doppler
shifts showed the presence of transverse waves. However, when analysing the intensity, waves are
less easily observed for more complex magnetic fields and may be mistaken for background noise.
Depending on the LOS angle, the observable signatures of waves reflect some of the magnetic field
braiding, particularly when multiple emission lines are available. In the more braided simulation,
signatures of phase mixing can be identified. We identify possible ambiguities in the interpretation
of wave modes based on the synthetic emission signatures. Conclusions. Most of the observables
within this article behave as expected, given knowledge of the evolution of the parameters in 3D
space. However, some intriguing observational signatures are present. Detecting regions of magnetic
field complexity is somewhat possible when waves are present. However, simultaneous spectroscopic
imaging from different lines is important to identify these locations. Care needs to be taken when
interpreting intensity and Doppler velocity signatures as torsional motions as, in our setup,
such signatures were a consequence of the magnetic field complexity and not torsional waves. Finally,
the kinetic energy, estimated with Doppler velocities, is dependent on the polarisation of the
wave, complexity of the background field and the LOS.

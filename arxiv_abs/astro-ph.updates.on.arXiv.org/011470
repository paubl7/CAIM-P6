(Abridged) Several phenomena in astrophysics generate light curves with time delays. Among these
are reverberation mapping, and lensed quasars. In some systems, the measurement of the time-delay
is complicated by the fact that the delayed components are unresolved and that the light curves are
generated from a red-noise process. We derive the likelihood function of the observations given
a model of either a combination of time-delayed light curves or a single light curve. This likelihood
function is different from the auto-correlation function. We demonstrate that given a single-band
light curve that is a combination of two (or more) time-shifted copies of an original light curve,
generated from a red-noise probability distribution, we can test if the total-flux light curve
is a composition of time-delayed copies or, alternatively, is consistent with being the original
light curve. Furthermorew, in some realistic cases, it is possible to measure the time delays and
flux ratios between these unresolved components even when the flux ratio is about 1/10. This method
is useful for identifying lensed quasars and simultaneously measuring their time delays, and for
estimating the reverberation time scales of active galactic nuclei. In a companion paper, we derive
a method that uses the center-of-light position (e.g., of a lensed quasar) along with the combined
flux. This allow us to identify lensed quasars and supernovae and measure their time delays, with
higher fidelity compared to the flux-only method. The astrometry + flux method, however, is not
suitable for quasar reverberation mapping. We also comment on the commonly used method of fitting
a power-law model to a power spectrum, and present the proper likelihood function for such a fit.
We test the new method on simulations and provide Python and MATLAB implementations.

We use sub-arcsecond resolution ($\sim$0.4$''$) observations with NOEMA at 1.37 mm to study the
dust emission and molecular gas of 18 high-mass star-forming regions. We combine the derived physical
and chemical properties of individual cores in these regions to estimate their ages. The temperature
structure of these regions are determined by fitting H2CO and CH3CN line emission. The density profiles
are inferred from the 1.37 mm continuum visibilities. The column densities of 11 different species
are determined by fitting the emission lines with XCLASS. Within the 18 observed regions, we identify
22 individual cores with associated 1.37 mm continuum emission and with a radially decreasing temperature
profile. We find an average temperature power-law index of q = 0.4$\pm$0.1 and an average density
power-law index of p = 2.0$\pm$0.2 on scales on the order of several 1 000 au. Comparing these results
with values of p derived in the literature suggest that the density profiles remain unchanged from
clump to core scales. The column densities relative to N(C18O) between pairs of dense gas tracers
show tight correlations. We apply the physical-chemical model MUSCLE to the derived column densities
of each core and find a mean chemical age of $\sim$60 000 yrs and an age spread of 20 000-100 000 yrs.
With this paper we release all data products of the CORE project available at https://www.mpia.de/core.
The CORE sample reveals well constrained density and temperature power-law distributions. Furthermore,
we characterize a large variety in molecular richness that can be explained by an age spread confirmed
by our physical-chemical modeling. The hot molecular cores show the most emission lines, but we
also find evolved cores at an evolutionary stage, in which most molecules are destroyed and thus
the spectra appear line-poor again.

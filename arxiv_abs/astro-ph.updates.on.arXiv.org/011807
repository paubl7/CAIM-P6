Neutral hydrogen (HI) intensity mapping is a promising technique to probe the large-scale structure
of the Universe, improving our understanding on the late-time accelerated expansion. In this work,
we first scrutinize how an alternative cosmology, interacting Dark Energy, can affect the 21-cm
angular power spectrum relative to the concordance $\Lambda$CDM model. We re-derive the 21-cm
brightness temperature fluctuation in the context of such interaction and uncover an extra new
contribution. Then we estimate the noise level of three upcoming HI intensity mapping surveys,
BINGO, SKA1-MID Band$\,$1 and Band$\,$2, respectively, and employ a Fisher matrix approach to
forecast their constraints on the interacting Dark Energy model. We find that while $\textit{Planck}\,$
2018 maintains its dominion over early-Universe parameter constraints, BINGO and SKA1-MID Band$\,$2
put complementary bounding to the latest CMB measurements on dark energy equation of state $w$,
the interacting strength $\lambda_i$ and the reduced Hubble constant $h$, and SKA1-MID Band$\,$1
even outperforms $\textit{Planck}\,$ 2018 in these late-Universe parameter constraints. The
expected minimum uncertainties are given by SKA1-MID Band$\,$1+$\textit{Planck}\,$: $\sim
0.35\%$ on $w$, $\sim 0.27\%$ on $h$, $\sim 0.61\%$ on HI bias $b_{\rm HI}$, and an absolute uncertainty
of about $3\times10^{-4}$ ($7\times10^{-4}$) on $\lambda_{1}$ ($\lambda_{2}$). Moreover,
we quantify the effect of increasing redshift bins and inclusion of redshift-space distortions
in updating the constraints. Our results indicate a bright prospect for HI intensity mapping surveys
in constraining interacting Dark Energy, whether on their own or further by a joint analysis with
other measurements.

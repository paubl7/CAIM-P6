GRS 1915+105 being one of the brightest transient black hole binary (BHB) in the X-rays, offers a
unique test-bed for the study of the connection between accretion and ejection mechanisms in BHBs.
In particular, this source can be used to study the accretion disc wind and how it depends on the state
changes in BHBs. Our aim is to investigate the origin and geometry of the accretion disc wind in GRS
1915+105. We analysed the spectra of GRS 1915+105 in the soft $\phi$ and hard $\chi$ classes, using
the high resolution spectroscopy offered by Chandra HETGS. In the soft state, we find a series of
wind absorption lines that follow a non linear dependence of velocity width, velocity shift and
equivalent width with respect to ionisation, indicating a multiple component or stratified outflow.
In the hard state we find only a faint Fe XXVI absorption line. We model the absorption lines in both
the states using a dedicated MHD wind model to investigate a magnetic origin of the wind and to probe
the cause of variability in the observed lines flux between the two states. The MHD disc wind model
provides a good fit for both states, indicating the possibility of a magnetic origin of the wind.
The multiple ionisation components of the wind are well characterised as a stratification of the
same magnetic outflow. We find that the observed variability in the lines flux between soft and hard
states cannot be explained by photo-ionisation alone but it is most likely due to a large (three orders
of magnitude) increase in the wind density. We find the mass outflow rate of the wind to be comparable
to the accretion rate, suggesting a intimate link between accretion and ejection processes that
lead to state changes in BHBs.

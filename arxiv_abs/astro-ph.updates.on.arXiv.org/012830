CONTEXT: [ABRIDGED]. For the Milky Way bulge, there are currently essentially no measurements
of carbon in un-evolved stars, hampering our abilities to properly compare Galactic chemical evolution
models to observational data for this still enigmatic stellar population. AIMS: We aim to determine
carbon abundances for our sample of 91 microlensed bulge dwarf and subgiant stars. Together with
new determinations for oxygen this forms the first statistically significant sample of bulge stars
that have C and O abundances measured, and for which the C abundances have not been altered by the nuclear
burning processes internal to the stars. METHODS: The analysis is based on high-resolution spectra
for a sample of 91 dwarf and subgiant stars that were obtained during microlensing events when the
brightnesses of the stars were highly magnified. Carbon abundances were determined through spectral
line synthesis of five CI lines around 9100 A, and oxygen abundances using the three OI lines at about
7770 A. [ABRIDGED] RESULTS: Carbon abundances was possible to determine for 70 of the 91 stars in
the sample and oxygen abundances for 88 of the 91 stars in the sample. The [C/Fe] ratio evolves essentially
in lockstep with [Fe/H], centred around solar values at all [Fe/H]. The [O/Fe]-[Fe/H] trend has
an appearance very similar to that observed for other alpha-elements in the bulge, [ABRIDGED].
When dividing the bulge sample into two sub-groups, one younger than 8 Gyr and one older than 8 Gyr,
the stars in the two groups follow exactly the elemental abundance trends defined by the solar neighbourhood
thin and thick disks, respectively. Comparisons with recent models of Galactic chemical evolution
in the [C/O]-[O/H] plane shows that the models that best match the data are the ones that have been
calculated with the Galactic thin and thick disks in mind. [ABRIDGED] ....

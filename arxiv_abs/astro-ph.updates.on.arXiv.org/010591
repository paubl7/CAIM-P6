We reveal a deep connection between alignment of dust grains by RAdiative torques (RATs) and MEchanical
Torques (METs) and rotational disruption of grains introduced by \cite{Hoangetal:2019}. We establish
the preferential disruption of grains aligned with attractor points of high angular momentum (high-J).
We introduce {\it fast alignment} and {\it fast disruption} for grains that are directly driven
to the high-J attractor on a timescale of spin-up, and {\it slow alignment} and {\it slow disruption}
for grains that are first moved to the low-J attractor and gradually transported to the high-J attractor
by gas collisions. We calculate the fraction of grains that experience fast alignment and disruption,
denoted by $f_{\rm high-J}$. The enhancement of grain magnetic susceptibility via iron inclusions
expands the parameter space for high-J attractors and increases $f_{\rm high-J}$. The increase
in the magnitude of RATs or METs can increase the efficiency of fast alignment and disruption, but
counter-intuitively, decreases the effect of slow alignment and disruption by stronger forcing
grains towards low-J attractors, whereas the increase in gas density accelerates disruption by
faster transporting grains to the high-J attractor. We also show that disruption induced by RATs
and METs depends on the angle between the magnetic field and the anisotropic flow, inducing differences
in disruption efficiency of grains at the same distance from the radiation source. We find that pinwheel
torques can increase the efficiency of {\it fast disruption} but may decrease the efficiency of
{\it slow disruption} by delaying the transport of grains from the low-J to high-J attractors via
gas collisions. The selective nature of the rotational disruption opens a possibility of observational
testing of grain composition as well as physical processes of grain alignment.

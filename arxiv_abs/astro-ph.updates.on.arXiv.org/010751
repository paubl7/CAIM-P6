The merger of two neutron stars or of a neutron star and a black hole typically results in the formation
of a post-merger accretion disk. Outflows from disks may dominate the overall ejecta from mergers
and be a major source of r-process nuclei in our universe. We explore the parameter space of such disks,
their outflows, and r-process yields by performing three-dimensional general-relativistic
magnetohydrodynamic (GRMHD) simulations with weak interactions and approximate neutrino transport.
We discuss the mapping between initial binary parameters and the parameter space of resulting disks,
chiefly characterized by their initial accretion rate. We demonstrate the existence of an ignition
threshold for weak interactions at around $\sim 10^{-3} M_\odot\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for typical
parameters by means of analytic calculations within a 1D $\alpha$-viscosity disk model and by explicit
GRMHD simulations. Focusing on the qualitative change in disk physics across the ignition threshold,
we find a degenerate, self-regulated, neutrino-cooled regime above the threshold and an advection
dominated regime below the threshold. Excess heating in the absence of neutrino cooling below the
threshold leads to $\gtrsim 60$% of the initial disk mass being ejected in outflows, with typical
velocities $\sim (0.1-0.2)c$ in the model we simulate, compared to $\lesssim 40$% at $\sim (0.1-0.15)c$
above the threshold. While disks below the threshold show suppressed production of light r-process
elements, disks above the threshold can produce the entire range of r-process elements in good agreement
with the observed solar system abundances. Disks below the ignition threshold may produce an overabundance
of actinides seen in actinide-boost stars. As gravitational-wave detectors start to sample the
neutron-star merger parameter space, different disk realizations may be observable via their
associated kilonova emission.

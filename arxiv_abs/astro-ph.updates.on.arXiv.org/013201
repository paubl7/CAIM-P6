The hot Jupiter WASP-79b is a prime target for exoplanet atmospheric characterization both now
and in the future. Here we present a thermal emission spectrum of WASP-79b, obtained via Hubble Space
Telescope Wide Field Camera 3 G141 observations as part of the PanCET program. Given the temporal
coverage of WASP-79b's secondary eclipse, we consider two scenarios: a fixed mid-eclipse time
based on the expected occurrence time and a mid-eclipse time as a free parameter. In both scenarios,
we can measure thermal emission from WASP-79b from 1.1-1.7 $\mu$m at 2.4$\sigma$ confidence consistent
with a 1900 K brightness temperature for the planet. We combine our observations with Spitzer dayside
photometry (3.6 and 4.5 $\mu$m) and compare these observations to a grid of atmospheric forward
models. Given the precision of our measurements, WASP-79b's infrared emission spectrum is consistent
with theoretical spectra assuming equilibrium chemistry, enhanced abundances of H-, VO, or FeH,
as well as clouds. The best match equilibrium model suggests WASP-79b's dayside has a solar metallicity
and carbon-to-oxygen ratio, alongside a recirculation factor of 0.75. Models including significant
H- opacity provide the best match to WASP-79b's emission spectrum near 1.58 $\mu$m. However, models
featuring high-temperature cloud species - formed via vigorous vertical mixing and low sedimentation
efficiencies - with little day-to-night energy transport also match WASP-79b's emission spectrum.
Given the broad range of equilibrium chemistry, disequilibrium chemistry, and cloudy atmospheric
models consistent with our observations of WASP-79b's dayside emission, further observations
will be necessary to constrain WASP-79b's dayside atmospheric properties.

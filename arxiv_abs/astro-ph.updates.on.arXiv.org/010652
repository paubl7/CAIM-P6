Measuring stellar inclinations is fundamental to understand planetary formation and dynamics
as well as physical conditions during star formation. Oscillation spectra of red giant stars exhibit
mixed modes that have both a gravity component from the radiative interior and a pressure component
from the convective envelope. Gravity-dominated (g-m) mixed modes split by rotation are well separated
inside frequency spectra, making possible accurate measurements of stellar inclinations. This
work aims at developing an automated and general approach to measure stellar inclinations, that
can be applied to any solar-type pulsator for which oscillation modes are identified, and at validating
it using red giant branch stars observed by Kepler. We use the mean height-to-background ratio of
dipole mixed modes with different azimuthal orders to measure stellar inclinations. The underlying
statistical distribution of inclinations is recovered in an unbiased way using a probability density
function for the stellar inclination angle. We derive stellar inclination measurements for 1139
stars on the red giant branch, for which Gehan et al. (2018) have identified the azimuthal order of
dipole g-m mixed modes. Raw measured inclinations exhibit strong deviation with respect to isotropy
which is expected for random inclinations over the sky. When taking uncertainties into account,
the reconstructed distribution of inclinations actually follows the expected isotropic distribution
of the rotational axis. This work highlights the biases that affect inclination measurements and
provides the way to infer their underlying statistical distribution. When the star is seen either
pole-on or equator-on, measurements are challenging and result in a biased distribution. Correcting
biases that appear at the low- and high inclination regimes allows us to recover the underlying inclination
distribution.

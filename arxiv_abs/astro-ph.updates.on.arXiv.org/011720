The early B star S1 in the Rho Ophiuchus cloud excites an HII region and illuminates a large egg-shaped
photodissociation (PDR) cavity. The PDR is restricted to the west and south-west by the dense molecular
Rho Oph A ridge, expanding more freely into the diffuse low density cloud to the north-east. We analyze
new SOFIA GREAT, GMRT and APEX data together with archival data from Herschel/PACS, JCMT/HARPS
to study the properties of the photo-irradiated ionized and neutral gas in this region. The tracers
include [C II] at 158 micron, [O I] at 63 and 145 micron, J=6-5 transitions of CO and 13CO, HCO+ (4-3),
radio continuum at 610 and 1420 MHz and HI at 21 cm. The PDR emission is strongly red-shifted to the
south-east of the nebula, and primarily blue-shifted on the north western side. The [C II] and and
[O I]63 spectra are strongly self-absorbed over most of the PDR. By using the optically thin counterparts,
[13C II] and [O I]145 respectively, we conclude that the self-absorption is dominated by the warm
(>80 K) foreground PDR gas and not by the surrounding cold molecular cloud. We estimate the column
densities of C+ and O of the PDR to be 3e18 and 2e19 cm^-2, respectively. Comparison of stellar far-ultraviolet
flux and reprocessed infrared radiation suggest enhanced clumpiness of the gas to the north-west.
Analysis of the emission from the PDR gas suggests the presence of at least three density components
consisting of high density (10^6 cm^-3) clumps, medium density (10^4 cm^-3) and diffuse (10^3 cm^-3)
interclump medium. The medium density component primarily contributes to the thermal pressure
of the PDR gas which is in pressure equilibrium with the molecular cloud to the west. We find that the
PDR is tilted and warped with the south-eastern side of the cavity being denser on the front and the
north-western side being denser on the rear.

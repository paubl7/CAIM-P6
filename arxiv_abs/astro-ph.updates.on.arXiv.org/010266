Besides the astrometric mission of the Gaia satellite, its repeated and high-precision measurements
serve also as an all-sky photometric transient survey. The sudden brightenings of the sources are
published as Gaia Photometric Science Alerts and are made publicly available allowing the community
to photometrically and spectroscopically follow-up the object. The goal of this paper was to analyze
the nature and derive the basic parameters of Gaia18aen, transient detected at the beginning of
2018. It coincides with the position of the emission line star WRAY 15-136. The brightening was classified
as a "nova?" on the basis of subsequent spectroscopic observation. We have analyzed two spectra
of Gaia18aen and collected the available photometry of the object covering the brightenings in
2018 and also the preceding and following periods of quiescence. Based on this observational data,
we have derived the parameters of Gaia18aen and discussed the nature of the object. Gaia18aen is
the first symbiotic star discovered by the Gaia satellite. The system is an S-type symbiotic star
and consists of an M giant of a slightly super-solar metallicity, with Teff ~3500 K, a radius of ~230
R$\odot$, and a high luminosity L ~7400 L$\odot$. The hot component is a hot white dwarf. We tentatively
determined the orbital period of the system ~487 days. The main outburst of Gaia18aen in 2018 was
accompanied by a decrease in the temperature of the hot component. The first phase of the outburst
was characterized by the high luminosity L ~27000 L$\odot$, which remained constant for about three
weeks after the optical maximum, later followed by the gradual decline of luminosity and increase
of temperature. Several re-brightenings have been detected on the timescales of hundreds of days.

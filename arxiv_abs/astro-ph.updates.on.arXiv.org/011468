Counted among the most powerful cosmic events, supernovae (SNe) and gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can
be highly disruptive for life: Their radiation can be harmful for biota or induce extinction by removing
most of the protective atmospheric ozone layer from terrestrial planets (TPs). Nearby high-energy
transient astrophysical events have been proposed as possible triggers of mass extinctions on
Earth. We assess the habitability of the Milky Way (MW) throughout its cosmic history against potentially
disruptive astrophysical transients with the aim of identifying the safest places and epochs within
our Galaxy. We also test the hypothesis that one long GRB played a leading role in the late Ordovician
mass-extinction event (~445 Myr ago). We characterised the habitability of the MW throughout its
cosmic history as a function of galactocentric distance of TPs. We estimated the dangerous effects
of transient astrophysical events (long and short GRBs and SNe) with a model that connects their
rate to the specific star formation and metallicity evolution within the Galaxy throughout its
cosmic history. Our model also accounts for the probability that TPs form around FGK and M stars.
Until about six billion years ago, the outskirts of the Galaxy were the safest places to live, despite
the relatively low density of TPs. In the last about four billion years, regions between 2 and 8 kpc
from the center, which had a higher density of TPs, became the best places for a relatively safer biotic
life growth. We confirm the hypothesis that one long GRB played a leading role in the late Ordovician
mass-extinction event. In the last 500 Myr, the safest neighborhood in the Galaxy was a region at
a distance of 2 to 8 kpc from the Galactic center, whereas the MW outskirts were sterilized by two to
five long GRBs.

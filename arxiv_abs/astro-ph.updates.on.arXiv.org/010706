Galactic winds are crucial to the cosmic cycle of matter, transporting material out of the dense
regions of galaxies. Observations show the coexistence of different temperature phases in such
winds, which is not easy to explain. We present a set of 3D shock-multicloud simulations that account
for radiative heating and cooling at temperatures between $10^2\,\rm K$ and $10^7\,\rm K$. The
interplay between shock heating, dynamical instabilities, turbulence, and radiative heating
and cooling creates a complex multi-phase flow with a rain-like morphology. Cloud gas fragments
and is continuously eroded, becoming efficiently mixed and mass loaded. The resulting warm mixed
gas then cools down and precipitates into new dense cloudlets, which repeat the process. Thus, radiative
cooling is able to sustain fast-moving dense gas by aiding condensation of gas from warm clouds and
the hot wind. In the ensuing outflow, hot gas with temperatures $\gtrsim 10^6\,\rm K$ outruns the
warm and cold phases, which reach thermal equilibrium near $\approx 10^4\,\rm K$ and $\approx 10^2\,\rm
K$, respectively. Although the volume filling factor of hot gas is higher in the outflow, most of
the mass is concentrated in dense gas cloudlets and filaments with these temperatures. More porous
multicloud layers result in more vertically extended outflows, and dense gas is more efficiently
produced in more compact layers. The cold phase is not accelerated by ram-pressure, but, instead,
precipitates from warm and mixed gas out of thermal equilibrium. This cycle can explain the presence
of high-velocity H\,{\sc i} gas with $N_{\rm H\,{\scriptstyle I}}=10^{19-21}\,\rm cm^{-2}$
and $\Delta v_{{\rm FWHM}}\lesssim37\,\rm km\,s^{-1}$ in the Galactic centre outflow.

We analyze Dark Energy Survey (DES) data to constrain a cosmological model where a subset of parameters
-- focusing on $\Omega_m$ -- are split into versions associated with structure growth (e.g. $\Omega_m^{\rm
grow}$) and expansion history (e.g. $\Omega_m^{\rm geo}$). Once the parameters have been specified
for the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model, which includes general relativity as a theory of gravity,
it uniquely predicts the evolution of both geometry (distances) and the growth of structure over
cosmic time. Any inconsistency between measurements of geometry and growth could therefore indicate
a breakdown of that model. Our growth-geometry split approach therefore serves as both a (largely)
model-independent test for beyond-$\Lambda$CDM physics, and as a means to characterize how DES
observables provide cosmological information. We analyze the same multi-probe DES data as arXiv:1811.02375
: DES Year 1 (Y1) galaxy clustering and weak lensing, which are sensitive to both growth and geometry,
as well as Y1 BAO and Y3 supernovae, which probe geometry. We additionally include external geometric
information from BOSS DR12 BAO and a compressed Planck 2015 likelihood, and external growth information
from BOSS DR12 RSD. We find no significant disagreement with $\Omega_m^{\rm grow}=\Omega_m^{\rm
geo}$. When DES and external data are analyzed separately, degeneracies with neutrino mass and
intrinsic alignments limit our ability to measure $\Omega_m^{\rm grow}$, but combining DES with
external data allows us to constrain both growth and geometric quantities. We also consider a parameterization
where we split both $\Omega_m$ and $w$, but find that even our most constraining data combination
is unable to separately constrain $\Omega_m^{\rm grow}$ and $w^{\rm grow}$. Relative to $\Lambda$CDM,
splitting growth and geometry weakens bounds on $\sigma_8$ but does not alter constraints on $h$.

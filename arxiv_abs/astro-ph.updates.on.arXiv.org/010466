High cadence transient surveys are able to capture supernovae closer to their first light than before.
Applying analytical models to such early emission, we can constrain the progenitor stars properties.
In this paper, we present observations of SN2018fif (ZTF18abokyfk). The supernova was discovered
close to first light and monitored by the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory. Early spectroscopic observations suggest that the progenitor of SN2018fif was surrounded
by relatively small amounts of circumstellar material (CSM) compared to all previous cases. This
particularity, coupled with the high cadence multiple-band coverage, makes it a good candidate
to investigate using shock-cooling models. We employ the SOPRANOS code, an implementation of the
model by Sapir & Waxman and its extension to early times by Morag, Sapir & Waxman. Compared with previous
implementations, SOPRANOS has the advantage of including a careful account of the limited temporal
validity domain of the shock-cooling model as well as allowing usage of the entirety of the early
UV data. We find that the progenitor of SN2018fif was a large red supergiant, with a radius of R=744.0_{-128.0}^{+183.0}
solar radii and an ejected mass of Mej=9.3_{-5.8}^{+0.4} solar masses. Our model also gives information
on the explosion epoch, the progenitor inner structure, the shock velocity and the extinction.
The distribution of radii is double-peaked, with lower radii corresponding to lower values of the
extinction, earlier recombination times and better match to the early UV data. If these correlations
persist in future objects, denser spectroscopic monitoring constraining the time of recombination,
as well as accurate UV observations (e.g. with ULTRASAT), will help break the radius-extinction
degeneracy and independently determine both.

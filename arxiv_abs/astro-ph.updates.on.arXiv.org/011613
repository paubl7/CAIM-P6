Accurate constraints on curvature provide a powerful probe of inflation. However, curvature constraints
based on specific assumptions of dark energy may lead to unreliable conclusions when used to test
inflation models. To avoid this, it is important to obtain constraints that are independent on assumptions
for dark energy. In this paper, we investigate such constraints on curvature from the geometrical
probe constructed from galaxy-lensing cross-correlations. We study comprehensively the cross-correlations
of galaxy with magnification, measured from type Ia supernovae's brightnesses ("$g\kappa^{\rm
SN}$"), with shear ("$g\kappa^{\rm g}$"), and with CMB lensing ("$g\kappa^{\rm CMB}$"). We find
for the LSST and Stage IV CMB surveys, "$g\kappa^{\rm SN}$" , "$g\kappa^{\rm g}$" and "$g\kappa^{\rm
CMB}$" can be detected with signal-to-noise ratio $S/N=104,\ 2291,\ 1842$ respectively. When
combined with supernovae Hubble diagram ("SN") to constrain curvature, we find galaxy-lensing
cross-correlation becomes increasingly important with more degrees of freedom allowed in dark
energy. Without any priors, we obtain error on $\Omega_K$ of $0.723$ from "SN + $g\kappa^{\rm SN}$",
$0.0417$ from "SN + $g\kappa^{\rm g}$", and $0.04$ from "SN + $g\kappa^{\rm g}$ + $g\kappa^{\rm
CMB}$" for the LSST and Stage IV CMB surveys. The last one is more competitive than a Stage IV BAO survey
("BAO"). When galaxy-lensing cross-correlations are added to the combined probe of "SN + BAO + CMB",
where "CMB" stands for Planck measurement for the CMB acoustic scale, we obtain constraint on $\Omega_K$
of $0.0013$, which is a factor of 7 improvement from "SN + BAO + CMB". We study improvements in these
results from increasing the high redshift extension of supernovae.

We present photometric and spectroscopic observations of Supernova 2020oi (SN 2020oi), a nearby
($\sim$17 Mpc) type-Ic supernova (SN Ic) within the grand-design spiral M100. We undertake a comprehensive
analysis to characterize the evolution of SN 2020oi and constrain its progenitor system. We detect
flux in excess of the fireball rise model $\delta t \approx 2.5$ days from the date of explosion in
multi-band optical and UV photometry from the Las Cumbres Observatory and the Neil Gehrels Swift
Observatory, respectively. The derived SN bolometric luminosity is consistent with an explosion
with $M_{\rm ej} = 0.81 \pm 0.03 \ M_{\odot}$, $E_{k}= 1.40 \pm 0.19 \times 10^{51} \rm{erg} \ \rm{s}^{-1}$,
and $M_{\rm Ni56} = 0.08 \pm 0.02 \ M_{\odot}$. Inspection of the event's decline reveals the highest
$\Delta m_{15,\rm{bol}}$ reported for a stripped-envelope event to date. Modeling of optical
spectra near event peak indicates a partially mixed ejecta comparable in composition to the ejecta
observed in SN 1994I, while the earliest spectrum shows signatures of a possible interaction with
material of a distinct composition surrounding the SN progenitor. Further, Hubble Space Telescope
(HST) pre-explosion imaging reveals a stellar cluster coincident with the event. From the cluster
photometry, we derive the mass and age of the SN progenitor using stellar evolution models implemented
in the BPASS library. Our results indicate that SN 2020oi occurred in a binary system from a progenitor
of mass $M_{\rm ZAMS} \approx 9.5 \pm 1.0 \ M_{\odot}$, corresponding to an age of $27 \pm 7$ Myr. SN
2020oi is the dimmest SN Ic event to date for which an early-time flux excess has been observed, and
the first in which an early excess is unlikely to be associated with shock-cooling.

A long sought after goal using chemical abundance patterns derived from metal-poor stars is to understand
the Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) and to pin down the nature of the first stars (Pop III). Here,
we use a sample of 14 metal-poor stars observed with the high-resolution spectrograph PEPSI at the
LBT to derive abundances of 32 elements (34 including limits). We present well-sampled abundance
patterns for all stars obtained using local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) radiative transfer
codes and 1D hydrostatic model atmospheres. It is currently well known that the assumptions of 1D
and LTE may hide several issues, thereby introducing biases in our interpretation as to the nature
of the first stars and the GCE. Hence, we use non-LTE (NLTE) and correct the abundances using 3D model
atmospheres to present a physically more reliable pattern. In order to infer the nature of the first
stars, we compare unevolved, cool stars, enriched by a single event (`mono-enriched'), with a set
of yield predictions to pin down the mass and energy of the Pop III progenitor. To date, only few bona
fide second generation mono-enriched stars are known. A simple x^2-fit may bias our inferred mass
and energy just as much as the simple 1D LTE abundance pattern, and we thus carried out our study with
an improved fitting technique considering dilution and mixing. Our sample presents Carbon Enhanced
Metal-Poor (CEMP) stars, some of which are promising true second generation (mono-enriched) stars.
The unevolved, dwarf BD+09_2190 shows a mono-enriched signature which, combined with kinematical
data, indicates that it moves in the outer halo and likely has been accreted onto the Milky Way early
on. The Pop III progenitor was likely of 25.5M and 0.6 10^51erg (foe)/19.2M and 1.5foe in LTE/NLTE.
Finally, we explore the predominant donor and formation site of the rapid and slow neutron-capture
elements. Abridged

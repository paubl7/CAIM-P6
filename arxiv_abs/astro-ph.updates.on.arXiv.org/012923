Upcoming galaxy surveys will allow us to probe the growth of the cosmic large-scale structure with
improved sensitivity compared to current missions, and will also map larger areas of the sky. This
means that in addition to the increased precision in observations, future surveys will also access
the ultra-large scale regime, where commonly neglected effects such as lensing, redshift-space
distortions and relativistic corrections become important for calculating correlation functions
of galaxy positions. At the same time, several approximations usually made in these calculations,
such as the Limber approximation, break down at those scales. The need to abandon these approximations
and simplifying assumptions at large scales creates severe issues for parameter estimation methods.
On the one hand, exact calculations of theoretical angular power spectra become computationally
expensive, and the need to perform them thousands of times to reconstruct posterior probability
distributions for cosmological parameters makes the approach unfeasible. On the other hand, neglecting
relativistic effects and relying on approximations may significantly bias the estimates of cosmological
parameters. In this work, we quantify this bias and investigate how an incomplete modeling of various
effects on ultra-large scales could lead to false detections of new physics beyond the standard
$\Lambda$CDM model. Furthermore, we propose a simple debiasing method that allows us to recover
true cosmologies without running the full parameter estimation pipeline with exact theoretical
calculations. This method can therefore provide a fast way of obtaining accurate values of cosmological
parameters and estimates of exact posterior probability distributions from ultra-large scale
observations.

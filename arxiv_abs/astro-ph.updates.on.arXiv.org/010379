The diffuse cosmic supernova neutrino background (DSNB) is observational target of the gadolinium-loaded
Super-Kamiokande (SK) detector and the forthcoming JUNO and Hyper-Kamiokande detectors. Current
predictions are hampered by our still incomplete understanding of the supernova (SN) explosion
mechanism and of the neutron star (NS) equation of state and maximum mass. In our comprehensive study
we revisit this problem on grounds of the landscapes of successful and failed SN explosions obtained
by Sukhbold et al. and Ertl et al. with parametrized one-dimensional neutrino engines for large
sets of single-star and helium-star progenitors, with the latter serving as proxy of binary evolution
effects. Besides considering engines of different strengths, leading to different fractions
of failed SNe with black-hole (BH) formation, we also vary the NS mass limit, the spectral shape of
the neutrino emission, and include contributions from poorly understood alternative NS-formation
channels such as accretion-induced or merger-induced collapse events. Since the neutrino signals
of our large model sets are approximate, we calibrate the associated degrees of freedom by using
state-of-the-art simulations of proto-neutron star cooling. Our predictions are higher than
other recent ones because of a large fraction of failed SNe with long delay to BH formation. Our best-guess
model predicts a DSNB electron-antineutrino-flux of 28.8^{+24.6}_{-10.9} cm^{-2}s^{-1} with
6.0^{+5.1}_{-2.1} cm^{-2}s^{-1} in the favorable measurement interval of [10,30] MeV, and 1.3^{+1.1}_{-0.4}
cm^{-2}s^{-1} with electron-antineutrino energies > 17.3 MeV, which is roughly a factor of two
below the current SK limit. The uncertainty range is dominated by the still insufficiently constrained
cosmic rate of stellar core-collapse events.

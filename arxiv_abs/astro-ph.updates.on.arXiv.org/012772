This work presents an in-depth analysis of four gravitationally lensed red galaxies at z = 1.6-3.2.
The sources are magnified by factors of 2.7-30 by foreground clusters, enabling spectral and morphological
measurements that are otherwise challenging. Our sample extends below the characteristic mass
of the stellar mass function and is thus more representative of the quiescent galaxy population
at z > 1 than previous spectroscopic studies. We analyze deep VLT/X-SHOOTER spectra and multi-band
Hubble Space Telescope photometry that cover the rest-frame UV-to-optical regime. The entire
sample resembles stellar disks as inferred from lensing-reconstructed images. Through stellar
population synthesis analysis we infer that the targets are young (median age = 0.1-1.2 Gyr) and
formed 80% of their stellar masses within 0.07-0.47 Gyr. Mg II $\lambda\lambda 2796,2803$ absorption
is detected across the sample. Blue-shifted absorption and/or redshifted emission of Mg II is found
in the two youngest sources, indicative of a galactic-scale outflow of warm ($T\sim10^{4}$ K) gas.
The [O III] $\lambda5007$ luminosity is higher for the two young sources (median age less than 0.4
Gyr) than the two older ones, perhaps suggesting a decline in nuclear activity as quenching proceeds.
Despite high-velocity ($v\approx1500$ km s$^{-1}$) galactic-scale outflows seen in the most
recently quenched galaxies, warm gas is still present to some extent long after quenching. Altogether
our results indicate that star formation quenching at high redshift must have been a rapid process
(< 1 Gyr) that does not synchronize with bulge formation or complete gas removal. Substantial bulge
growth is required if they are to evolve into the metal-rich cores of present-day slow-rotators.

Aims: The complexity of star formation at the physical scale of molecular clouds is not yet fully
understood. We investigate the mechanisms regulating the formation of stars in different environments
within nearby star-forming galaxies from the PHANGS sample. Methods: Integral field spectroscopic
data and radio-interferometric observations of 18 galaxies were combined to explore the existence
of the resolved star formation main sequence (rSFMS), resolved Kennicutt-Schmidt relation (rKS),
and resolved molecular gas main sequence (rMGMS), and we derived their slope and scatter at spatial
resolutions from 100 pc to 1 kpc (under various assumptions). Results: All three relations were
recovered at the highest spatial resolution (100 pc). Furthermore, significant variations in
these scaling relations were observed across different galactic environments. The exclusion
of non-detections has a systematic impact on the inferred slope as a function of the spatial scale.
Finally, the scatter of the $\Sigma_\mathrm{mol. gas + stellar}$ versus $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$
correlation is smaller than that of the rSFMS, but higher than that found for the rKS. Conclusions:
The rMGMS has the tightest relation at a spatial scale of 100 pc (scatter of 0.34 dex), followed by
the rKS (0.41 dex) and then the rSFMS (0.51 dex). This is consistent with expectations from the timescales
involved in the evolutionary cycle of molecular clouds. Surprisingly, the rKS shows the least variation
across galaxies and environments, suggesting a tight link between molecular gas and subsequent
star formation. The scatter of the three relations decreases at lower spatial resolutions, with
the rKS being the tightest (0.27 dex) at a spatial scale of 1 kpc. Variation in the slope of the rSFMS
among galaxies is partially due to different detection fractions of $\Sigma_\mathrm{SFR}$ with
respect to $\Sigma_\mathrm{stellar}$.

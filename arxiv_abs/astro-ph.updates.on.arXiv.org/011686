Gathering observations report a growing number of metal-poor stars showing an abundance pattern
midway between the s- and r-processes. These so called r/s-stars raise the need for an intermediate
neutron capture process (i-process), which is thought to result from the ingestion of protons in
a convective helium-burning region, but whose astrophysical site is still largely debated. We
investigate whether an i-process during the asymptotic giant branch (AGB) phase of low-metallicity
low-mass stars can develop and whether it can explain the abundances of observed r/s-stars. At the
beginning of the AGB phase, during the third thermal pulse, the helium driven convection zone is
able to penetrate in the hydrogen rich layers. The subsequent proton ingestion leads to a strong
neutron burst with neutron densities of $\approx 4.3 \times 10^{14}$ cm$^{-3}$ at the origin of
the synthesis of i-process elements. The nuclear energy released by proton burning in the helium-burning
convective shell strongly affects the internal structure: the thermal pulse splits and after $\approx
10$ yr the upper part of the convection zone merges with the convective envelope. The surface carbon
abundance is enhanced by more than 3 dex, leading to an increase of the opacity which triggers a strong
mass loss and prevents any further thermal pulse. We show that specific isotopic ratios of Ba, Nd,
Sm and Eu can represent good tracers of i-process nucleosynthesis. Finally, an extended comparison
with 14 selected r/s-stars show that the observed composition patterns can be well reproduced by
our i-process AGB model. However, such AGB models cannot account for the high level of enrichment
of the giant r/s-stars in a scenario involving pollution by a former AGB companion.

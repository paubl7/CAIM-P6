Aims: It has recently been shown that the fast migration of Titan could be responsible for the current
26.7{\deg}-tilt of Saturn's spin axis. We aim to quantify the level of generality of this result
and to measure the most likely sets of parameters. We also aim to determine the obliquity that Saturn
will reach in the future. Methods: We explore a broad range of parameters and propagate numerically
the orientation of Saturn's spin axis both backward and forward in time. Results: In the adiabatic
regime, the likelihood of reproducing Saturn's current spin-axis orientation is maximised for
primordial obliquities between about 2{\deg} and 7{\deg}. For a slightly faster migration than
expected from radio-science experiments, non-adiabatic effects even allow for exactly null primordial
obliquities. Starting from such small tilts, Saturn's spin axis can evolve up to its current state
provided that: i) the semi-major axis of Titan changed by more than 5% of its current value, and ii)
its migration rate does not exceed 10 times the nominal measured rate. In comparison, observational
data suggest that the increase of Titan's semi-major axis exceeded 50% over 4 Gyrs, and error bars
imply that the current migration rate is unlikely to be larger than 1.5 times its nominal value. Conclusions:
If Titan did migrate substantially before today, tilting Saturn from a small obliquity is not only
possible, but it is the most likely scenario. Saturn's obliquity is expected to be still increasing
today and could exceed 65{\deg} in the future. Maximising the likelihood would also put strict constraints
on Saturn's polar moment of inertia. However, the possibility remains that Saturn's primordial
obliquity was already large, for instance as a result of a massive collision. The unambiguous distinction
between these two scenarios would be given by a precise measure of Saturn's polar moment of inertia.

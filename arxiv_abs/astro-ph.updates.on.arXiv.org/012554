In an earlier study, we reported that the ram gauge of the COmet Pressure Sensor (COPS), one of the
three instruments of the Rosetta Orbiter Spectrometer for Ion and Neutral Analysis (ROSINA), could
be used to obtain information about the sublimating content of icy particles, made up of volatiles
and conceivably refractories coming from comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. In this work, we extend
the investigation to the second COPS gauge, the nude gauge. In particular, we analyse the volume
of the volatile content of coma particles, along with a search for possible dependencies between
the nude gauge detection rate (i.e. the rate at which icy particles are detected by the nude gauge)
and the position of the Rosetta spacecraft. We also investigate the correlations of the nude gauge
detection rate with the quantities associated with cometary activity. Although it was not originally
designed for such a purpose, the COPS nude gauge has been able to detect $\sim$67000 features generated
by the sublimation of the volatile content of icy particles. The nude gauge detection rate follows
a trend that is inversely proportional to the heliocentric distance. This result is interpreted
as a confirmation of a possible relation between the nude gauge detection rate and cometary activity.
Thus, we compared the former with parameters related to cometary activity and obtained significant
correlations, indicating that the frequency of icy particle detection is driven by cometary activity.
Furthermore, by representing the volatile part of the icy particles as equivalent spheres with
a density of 1 g cm$^{-3}$, we obtained a range of diameters between 60 and 793 nanometres, with the
smaller ones ($<390\,\mathrm{nm}$ in diameter) having a size distribution power index of $-4.79\pm
0.26$.

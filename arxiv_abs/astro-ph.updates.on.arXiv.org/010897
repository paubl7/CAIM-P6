Characterizing the galaxy population in the early Universe holds the key to understanding the evolution
of these objects and the role they played in cosmic reionization. However, the number of observations
at the very highest redshifts are to date, few. In order to shed light on the properties of galaxies
in the high-redshift Universe and their interstellar media, we observe the Lyman-$\alpha$ emitting
galaxy z7\_GSD\_3811 at $z=7.664$ with band 6 and 8 at the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter
Array (ALMA). We target the far-infrared [O III] 88 $\mu m$, [C II] 158 $\mu m$ emission lines and dust
continuum in the star-forming galaxy z7\_GSD\_3811 with ALMA. We combine these measurements with
earlier observations in the rest-frame ultraviolet (UV) in order to characterize the object, and
compare results to those of earlier studies observing [O III] and [C II] emission in high-redshift
galaxies. The [O III] 88 $\mu m$ and [C II] 158 $\mu m$ emission lines are undetected at the position
of z7\_GSD\_3811, with $3\sigma$ upper limits of $1.6 \ \times \ 10^{8} \ L_{\odot}$ and $4.0 \ \times
\ 10^{7} \ L_{\odot}$, respectively. We do not detect any dust continuum in band 6 nor band 8. The measured
rms in the band 8 and band 6 continuum is 26 and 9.9 $\mu Jy \ beam^{-1}$, respectively. Similar to several
other high-redshift galaxies, z7\_GSD\_3811 exhibits low [C II] emission for its star formation
rate compared to local galaxies. Furthermore, our upper limit on the [O III] line luminosity is lower
than all the previously observed [O III] lines in high-redshift galaxies with similar ultraviolet
luminosities. Our ALMA band 6 and 8 dust continuum observations imply that z7\_GSD\_3811 likely
has a low dust content, and our non-detections of the [O III] and [C II] lines could indicate that z7\_GSD\_3811
has a low metallicity ($Z \lesssim 0.1 \ Z_{\odot}$).

The projected density distribution of type ab RR Lyrae stars was characterized from the innermost
regions of the Milky Way to the halo, with the aim of placing constraints on the Galaxy s evolution.
The compiled sample (N_(RRab)= 64,850) stems from fundamental mode RR Lyrae variables identified
by the VVV, OGLE and Gaia surveys. The distribution is well fitted by three power laws over three radial
intervals: in the innermost region (R < 2.2 deg) the distribution follows Sigma_(RRab[1]) propto
R ^(-0.94 +- 0.051), while in the external region the distribution adheres to Sigma_(RRab[2]) propto
R^(-1.50 +- 0.019) for 2.2 deg< R <8.0 deg and Sigma_(RRab[3]) propto R ^(-2.43 +- 0.043) for 8.0 deg<
R <30.0 deg. Conversely, the cumulative distribution of red clump giants exhibits a more concentrated
distribution in the mean but in the central R < 2.2 deg the RRab population is more peaked, whereas
globular clusters follow a density power law (Sigma_(GCs) propto R ^(-1.59 +- 0.060) for R<30.0
deg) similar to that of RRab stars, especially when considering a more metal poor subsample ([Fe/H]<-1.1
dex). A key conclusion emerging from the analysis is that RRab distribution favours the star cluster
infall and merger scenario for creating an important fraction (>18 %) of the central Galactic region.
The radii containing half of the populations (half populations radii) are: RH_(RRab)=6.8 deg (0.99
kpc), RH_(RC)=4.2 deg (0.61 kpc), and RH_(GCs)=11.9 deg (1.75 kpc) for the RRab stars, red clump
giants, and globular clusters, respectively. Finally, merely sim 1% of the stars have been actually
discovered in the innermost region (R < 35 pc), out of the expected (on the base of our considerations)
total number of RRab therein N sim 1,562. That deficit shall be substantially ameliorated with future
space missions like the Nancy Roman Space Telescope (formerly WFIRST).

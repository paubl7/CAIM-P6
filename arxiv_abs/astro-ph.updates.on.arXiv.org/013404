Electron conduction opacities are one of the main physics inputs for the calculation of low- and
intermediate-mass stellar models, and a critical question is how to bridge calculations for moderate
and strong degeneracy, which are necessarily performed adopting different methods. The density-temperature
regime at the boundary between moderate and strong degeneracy is in fact crucial for modelling the
helium cores of red giant branch stars and the hydrogen/helium envelopes of white dwarfs. Prompted
by recently published new, improved calculations of electron thermal conductivities and opacities
for moderate degeneracy, we study different, physically motivated prescriptions to bridge these
new computations with well established results in the regime of strong degeneracy. We find that
these different prescriptions have a sizable impact on the predicted He-core masses at the He-flash
(up to 0.01$M_{\odot}$ for initial total masses far from the transition to non-degenerate He-cores,
and up to $\sim 0.04M_{\odot}$ for masses around the transition), the tip of the red giant branch
(up to $\sim$0.1~mag) and the zero age horizontal branch luminosities (up to 0.03~dex for masses
far from the transition, and up to $\sim$0.2~dex around the transition), and white dwarf cooling
times (up to 40-45\% at high luminosities, and up to $\sim$25\% at low luminosities). Current empirical
constraints on the tip of the red giant branch and the zero age horizontal branch absolute magnitudes
do not allow yet to definitely exclude any of these alternative options for the conductive opacities.
Tests against observations of slowly-cooling faint WDs in old stellar populations will need to
be performed to see whether they can set some more stringent constraints on how to bridge calculations
of conductive opacities for moderate and strong degeneracy.

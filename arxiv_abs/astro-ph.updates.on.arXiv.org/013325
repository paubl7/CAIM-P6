[abridged] The International LOFAR Telescope is an interferometer with stations spread across
Europe. With baselines of up to ~2,000 km, LOFAR has the unique capability of achieving sub-arcsecond
resolution at frequencies below 200 MHz, although this is technically and logistically challenging.
Here we present a calibration strategy that builds on previous high-resolution work with LOFAR.
We give an overview of the calibration strategy and discuss the special challenges inherent to enacting
high-resolution imaging with LOFAR, and describe the pipeline, which is publicly available, in
detail. We demonstrate the calibration strategy by using the pipeline on P205+55, a typical LOFAR
Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) pointing. We perform in-field delay calibration, solution referencing
to other calibrators, self-calibration, and imaging of example directions of interest in the field.
For this specific field and these ionospheric conditions, dispersive delay solutions can be transferred
between calibrators up to ~1.5 degrees away, while phase solution transferral works well over 1
degree. We demonstrate a check of the astrometry and flux density scale. Imaging in 17 directions,
the restoring beam is typically 0.3" x 0.2" although this varies slightly over the entire 5 square
degree field of view. We achieve ~80 to 300 $\mu$Jy/bm image rms noise, which is dependent on the distance
from the phase centre; typical values are ~90 $\mu$Jy/bm for the 8 hour observation with 48 MHz of
bandwidth. Seventy percent of processed sources are detected, and from this we estimate that we
should be able to image ~900 sources per LoTSS pointing. This equates to ~3 million sources in the
northern sky, which LoTSS will entirely cover in the next several years. Future optimisation of
the calibration strategy for efficient post-processing of LoTSS at high resolution (LoTSS-HR)
makes this estimate a lower limit.

The widespread rings and gaps seen in the dust continuum in protoplanetary disks are sometimes accompanied
by similar substructures seen in molecular line emission. One example is the outer gap at 100 au in
AS 209, which shows that the H$_{13}$CO$^+$ and C$_{18}$O emission intensities decrease along
with the continuum in the gap, while the DCO$^+$ emission increases inside the gap. We aim to study
the behavior of DCO$^+$/H$_{13}$CO$^+$ and DCO$^+$/HCO$^+$ ratios in protoplanetary disk gaps
assuming the two scenarios: the gas depletion follows the dust depletion and only the dust is depleted.
We first modeled the physical disk structure using the thermo-chemical model ANDES. This 1+1D steady-state
disk model calculates the thermal balance of gas and dust and includes the FUV, X-rays, cosmic rays,
and other ionization sources together with the reduced chemical network for molecular coolants.
Afterward, this physical structure was adopted for calculations of molecular abundances with
the extended gas-grain chemical network with deuterium fractionation. Ideal synthetic spectra
and 0th-moment maps were produced with LIME. We are able to qualitatively reproduce the increase
in the DCO$^+$ intensity and the decrease in the H$_{13}$CO$^+$ and C$_{18}$O intensities inside
the disk gap, which is qualitatively similar to what is observed in the outer AS 209 gap. The corresponding
disk model assumes that both the gas and dust are depleted in the gap. The model with the gas-rich gap,
where only the dust is depleted, produces emission that is too bright in all HCO$^+$ isotopologues
and C$_{18}$O. The DCO$^+$/H$_{13}$CO$^+$ line ratio can be used to probe gas depletion in dust
continuum gaps outside of the CO snow line. The DCO$^+$/C$_{18}$O line ratio shows a similar, albeit
weaker, effect; however, these species can be observed simultaneously with a single ALMA or NOEMA
setup.

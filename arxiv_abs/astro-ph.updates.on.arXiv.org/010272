The presence of nitrogen-enriched stars in globular clusters provides key evidence for multiple
stellar populations (MPs), as has been demonstrated with globular cluster spectroscopic data
towards the bulge, disk, and halo. In this work, we employ the VVV Infrared Astrometric Catalogue
(VIRAC) and the DR16 SDSS-IV release of the APOGEE survey to provide the first detailed spectroscopic
study of the bulge globular cluster UKS~1. Based on these data, a sample of six selected cluster members
was studied. We find the mean metallicity of UKS~1 to be [Fe/H]$=-0.98\pm0.11$, considerably more
metal-poor than previously reported, and a negligible metallicity scatter, typical of that observed
by APOGEE in other Galactic globular clusters. In addition, we find a mean radial velocity of $66.1\pm12.9$
km s$^{-1}$, which is in good agreement with literature values, within 1$\sigma$. By selecting
stars in the VIRAC catalogue towards UKS~1, we also measure a mean proper motion of ($\mu_{\alpha}\cos(\delta)$,
$\mu_{\delta}$) $=$ ($-2.77\pm0.23$,$-2.43\pm0.16$) mas yr$^{-1}$. We find strong evidence
for the presence of MPs in UKS~1, since four out of the six giants analysed in this work have strong
enrichment in nitrogen ([N/Fe]$\gtrsim+0.95$) accompanied by lower carbon abundances ([C/Fe]$\lesssim-0.2$).
Overall, the light- (C, N), $\alpha$- (O, Mg, Si, Ca, Ti), Fe-peak (Fe, Ni), Odd-Z (Al, K), and the
\textit{s}-process (Ce, Nd, Yb) elemental abundances of our member candidates are consistent
with those observed in globular clusters at similar metallicity. Furthermore, the overall star-to-star
abundance scatter of elements exhibiting the multiple-population phenomenon in UKS~1 is typical
of that found in other global clusters (GCs), and larger than the typical errors of some [X/Fe] abundances.

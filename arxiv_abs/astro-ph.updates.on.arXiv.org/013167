Spectrographs nominally contain a degree of quasi-static optical aberrations resulting from
the quality of manufactured component surfaces, imperfect alignment, design residuals, thermal
effects, and other other associated phenomena involved in the design and construction process.
Aberrations that change over time can mimic the line centroid motion of a Doppler shift, introducing
radial velocity (RV) uncertainty that increases time-series variability. Even when instrument
drifts are tracked using a precise wavelength calibration source, barycentric motion of the Earth
leads to a wavelength shift of stellar light causing a translation of the spectrum across the focal
plane array by many pixels. The wavelength shift allows absorption lines to experience different
optical propagation paths and aberrations over observing epochs. We use physical optics propagation
simulations to study the impact of aberrations on precise Doppler measurements made by diffraction-limited,
high-resolution spectrographs. We quantify the uncertainties that cross-correlation techniques
introduce in the presence of aberrations and barycentric RV shifts. We find that aberrations which
shift the PSF photo-center in the dispersion direction, in particular primary horizontal coma
and trefoil, are the most concerning. To maintain aberration-induced RV errors less than 10 cm/s,
phase errors for these particular aberrations must be held well below 0.05 waves at the instrument
operating wavelength. Our simulations further show that wavelength calibration only partially
compensates for instrumental drifts, owing to a behavioral difference between how cross-correlation
techniques handle aberrations between starlight versus calibration light. Identifying subtle
physical effects that influence RV errors will help ensure that diffraction-limited planet-finding
spectrographs are able to reach their full scientific potential.

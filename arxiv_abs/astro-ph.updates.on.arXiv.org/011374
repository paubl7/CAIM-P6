We study how half-mass radii, central mass densities ($\Sigma_1$), and color gradients change
as galaxies evolve. We classify $\sim7,000$ galaxies into sixteen groups with similar spectral
shapes; each group represents a different evolutionary stage. We find that different galaxy types
populate different regions of both size-mass and $\Sigma_1$-mass space. The nine star-forming
groups lie along the integrated star-forming $\Sigma_1$-mass relation. However, these star-forming
groups form steep parallel relations in the size-mass plane, with slopes similar to the quiescent
size-mass relation. These steep slopes can be explained as a transformation of the star-forming
$\Sigma_1$-mass relation and its scatter. We identify three types of transitional galaxies. Green
valley and post-starburst galaxies are similarly compact at $z>1.5$; however, their distinct
color gradients indicate that the two populations represent different pathways to quenching.
Post-starburst galaxies have flat color gradients and compact structures, consistent with a fast
quenching pathway which requires structural change and operates primarily at high redshift. Green
valley galaxies have negative color gradients, and are both larger and more numerous towards lower
redshift. These galaxies are consistent with slow quenching without significant structural change.
We find that dusty star-forming galaxies at $z\gtrsim2$ are very compact, and may represent the
"burst" before post-starburst galaxies; at $z\lesssim2$, dusty star-forming galaxies are extended
and have shallow color gradients consistent with slow quenching. Our results suggest that star-forming
galaxies grow gradually up the \sig-mass relation until (a) they naturally reach the high $\Sigma_1$
values required for quiescence, or (b) a compaction-type event rapidly increases their $\Sigma_1$.

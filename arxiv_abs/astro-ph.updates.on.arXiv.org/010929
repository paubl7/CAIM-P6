Reflective imaging systems form an important part of photonic devices such as spectrometers, telescopes,
augmented and virtual reality headsets or lithography platforms. Reflective optics provide unparalleled
spectral performance and can be used to reduce overall volume and weight. So far, most reflective
designs have focused on two or three reflections, while four-reflection freeform designs can deliver
a higher light throughput (faster F-number) as well as a larger field-of-view (FOV). However, advanced
optical design strategies for four-reflection freeform systems have been rarely reported in literature.
This is due to the increased complexity in solution space but also the fact that additional mirrors
hinder a cost-effective realization (manufacture, alignment, etc.). Recently, we have proposed
a novel design method to directly calculate the freeform surface coefficients while merely knowing
the mirror positions and tilts. Consequently, this method allows laymen with basic optical design
knowledge to calculate 'first time right' freeform imaging systems in a matter of minutes. This
contrasts with most common freeform design processes, which requires considerable experience,
intuition or guesswork. Firstly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method for a
four-mirror high-throughput telescope with 250mm-focal-length, F/2.5 and a wide rectangular
FOV of 8.5{\deg} x 25.5{\deg}. In a subsequent step, we propose an effective three-mirror but four-reflection
imaging system, which consists of two freeform mirrors and one double-reflection spherical mirror.
Compared with common three-mirror and three-reflection imagers, our novel multi-reflection
system shows unprecedented possibilities for an economic implementation while drastically reducing
the overall volume.

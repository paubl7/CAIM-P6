Tracing the emergence of the massive quiescent galaxy (QG) population requires the build-up of
reliable quenched samples, disentangling these systems from red, dusty star-forming sources.
We present Hubble Space Telescope WFC3/G141 grism spectra of 10 quiescent galaxy candidates selected
at $2.5<z<3.5$ in the COSMOS field. Spectroscopic confirmation for the whole sample is obtained
within 1-3 orbits thanks to the presence of strong spectral breaks and Balmer absorption lines.
Combining their spectra with optical to near-infrared (near-IR) photometry, star-forming solutions
are formally rejected for the entire sample. Broad spectral indices are consistent with the presence
of young A-type stars flagging the last major episode of star formation to have taken place no earlier
than $\sim$300-800 Myr prior to observation. Marginalizing over three different slopes of the
dust attenuation curve, we obtain short mass-weighted ages and an average peak star formation rate
of SFR$\sim10^3$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$ at $z_{formation}\sim3.5$. Despite mid- and far-IR data
being too shallow to determine the obscured SFR on a galaxy-by-galaxy basis, median stack emission
from 3GHz data constrains the level of residual obscured SFR to be globally below 50 M$_{\odot}$
yr$^{-1}$, hence three times below the scatter of the coeval main sequence. Alternatively, the
very same radio detection suggests a widespread radio-mode feedback by active galactic nuclei
(AGN) four times stronger than in z$\sim$1.8 massive QGs. This is accompanied by a 30% fraction of
X-ray luminous AGN with a black hole accretion rate per unit SFR enhanced by a factor of $\sim30$ with
respect to similarly massive QGs at lower redshift. The average compact, bulge-dominated morphologies,
coupled with the young mass-weighted ages, suggest that structural transformation might be concomitant
with (or preceding) quenching.

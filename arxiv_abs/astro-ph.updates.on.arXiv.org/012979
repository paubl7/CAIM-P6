We aim to study the nature of the faint, polarised radio source population whose source composition
and redshift dependence contain information about the strength, morphology, and evolution of
magnetic fields over cosmic timescales. We use a 15 pointing radio continuum L-band mosaic of the
Lockman Hole, observed in full polarisation, generated from archival data of the WSRT. The data
were analysed using the RM-Synthesis technique. We achieved a noise of 7 {\mu}Jy/beam in polarised
intensity, with a resolution of 15''. Using infrared and optical images and source catalogues,
we were able to cross-identify and determine redshifts for one third of our detected polarised sources.
We detected 150 polarised sources, most of which are weakly polarised with a mean fractional polarisation
of 5.4 %. With a total area of 6.5 deg^2 and a detection threshold of 6.25 {\sigma} we find 23 polarised
sources per deg^2. Based on our multi wavelength analysis, we find that our sample consists of AGN
only. We find a discrepancy between archival number counts and those present in our data, which we
attribute to sample variance. Considering the absolute radio luminosty, to distinguish weak and
strong sources, we find a general trend of increased probability to detect weak sources at low redshift
and strong sources at high redshift. Further, we find an anti-correlation between fractional polarisation
and redshift for our strong sources sample at z{\geq}0.6. A decrease in the fractional polarisation
of strong sources with increasing redshift cannot be explained by a constant magnetic field and
electron density over cosmic scales, however the changing properties of cluster environments
over the cosmic timemay play an important role. Disentangling these two effects requires deeper
and wider polarisation observations, and better models of the morphology and strength of cosmic
magnetic fields.

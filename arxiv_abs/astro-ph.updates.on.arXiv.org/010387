(Abridged) The aim of this study is to investigate the chemical evolution from the prestellar phase
to the formation of the disk, and to determine the impact that the chemical composition of the cold
and dense core has on the final composition of the disk. We performed 3D nonideal magneto-hydrodynamic
(MHD) simulations of a dense core collapse using the adaptive-mesh-refinement RAMSES code. For
each particle ending in the young rotationally supported disk, we ran chemical simulations with
the three-phase gas-grain chemistry code Nautilus. Two different sets of initial abundances,
which are characteristic of cold cores, were considered. The final distributions of the abundances
of common species were compared to each other, as well as with the initial abundances of the cold core.
We find that the spatial distributions of molecules reflect their sensitivity to the temperature
distribution. The main carriers of the chemical elements in the disk are usually the same as the ones
in the cold core, except for the S-bearing species, where HS is replaced by H$_2$S$_3$, and the P-bearing
species, where atomic P leads to the formation of PO, PN, HCP, and CP. However, the abundances of less
abundant species change over time. This is especially the case for "large" complex organic molecules
(COMs) such as CH$_3$CHO, CH$_3$NH$_2$, CH$_3$OCH$_3$, and HCOOCH$_3$ which see their abundances
significantly increase during the collapse. These COMs often present similar abundances in the
disk despite significantly different abundances in the cold core. In contrast, the abundances
of many radicals decrease with time. A significant number of species still show the same abundances
in the cold core and the disk, which indicates efficient formation of these molecules in the cold
core. This includes H$_2$O, H$_2$CO, HNCO, and "small" COMs such as CH$_3$OH, CH$_3$CN, and NH$_2$CHO.

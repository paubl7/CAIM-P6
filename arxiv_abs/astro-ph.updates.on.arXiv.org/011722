We aim to unravel the interior mixing profile of the pulsating eclipsing binary KIC9850387 by comparing
its dynamical parameters and the parameters derived through a combination of evolutionary and
asteroseismic modelling. We created a grid of stellar evolutionary models using the stellar evolutionary
code \textsc{mesa} and performed an isochrone-cloud (isocloud) based evolutionary modelling
of the system. We then generated a grid of pulsational models using the stellar pulsation code \textsc{gyre}
based on the age constraints from the evolutionary modelling. Finally, we performed asteroseismic
modelling of the observed $\ell=1$ and $\ell=2$ period-spacing patterns, utilising different
combinations of observational constraints, merit functions, and asteroseismic observables
to obtain strong constraints on the interior properties of the primary star. Through a combination
of asteroseismic modelling and dynamical constraints, we found that the system comprises two main-sequence
components at an age of $1.2\pm0.1$ Gyr. We also observed that asteroseismic modelling provided
stronger constraints on the interior properties than evolutionary modelling. Overall, we found
high levels of interior mixing and posited that this is a result of intrinsic non-tidal mixing mechanisms
due to a similar observed behaviour in single stars. We investigated the high-frequency regime
of KIC9850387 and found evidence of the surface effect as well as rotational splitting in the form
of a prograde-retrograde dipole g$_{1}$ mode doublet with a missing zonal mode. We find that the
dynamical parameters and the parameters extracted from the asteroseismic modelling of period-spacing
patterns are only barely compliant, reinforcing the need for homogeneous analyses of samples of
pulsating eclipsing binaries that aim to calibrating interior mixing profiles.

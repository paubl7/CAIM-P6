In this work, we investigate the influence of planetary tidal interactions on the transit-timing
variations of short-period low-mass rocky exoplanets. For such purpose, we employ the recently-developed
creep tide theory to compute tidally-induced TTVs. We implement the creep tide in the recently-developed
Posidonius N-body code, thus allowing for a high-precision evolution of the coupled spin-orbit
dynamics of planetary systems. As a working example for the analyses of tidally-induced TTVs, we
apply our version of the code to the K2-265 b planet. We analyse the dependence of tidally-induced
TTVs with the planetary rotation rate, uniform viscosity coefficient and eccentricity. Our results
show that the tidally-induced TTVs are more significant in the case where the planet is trapped in
non-synchronous spin-orbit resonances, in particular the 3/2 and 2/1 spin-orbit resonant states.
An analysis of the TTVs induced separately by apsidal precession and tidally-induced orbital decay
has allowed for the conclusion that the latter effect is much more efficient at causing high-amplitude
TTVs than the former effect by 2 - 3 orders of magnitude. We compare our findings for the tidally-induced
TTVs obtained with Posidonius with analytical formulations for the transit timings used in previous
works, and verified that the results for the TTVs coming from Posidonius are in excellent agreement
with the analytical formulations. These results show that the new version of Posidonius containing
the creep tide theory implementation can be used to study more complex cases in the future. For instance,
the code can be used to study multiplanetary systems, in which case planet-planet gravitational
perturbations must be taken into account additionally to tidal interactions to obtain the TTVs.

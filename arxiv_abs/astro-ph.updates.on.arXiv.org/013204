The direct detection of new extrasolar planets from high-precision photometry data is commonly
based on the observation of the transit signal of the planet as it passes in front of its star. Close-in
planets, however, leave additional imprints in the light curve even if they do not transit. These
are the so-called phase curve variations that include ellipsoidal, reflection and beaming effects.
In Millholland & Laughlin (2017), the authors scrutinized the Kepler database looking for these
phase variations from non-transiting planets. They found 60 candidates whose signals were compatible
with planetary companions. In this paper, we perform a ground-based follow-up of a sub-sample of
these systems with the aim of confirming and characterizing these planets and thus validating the
detection technique. We used the CAFE and HERMES instruments to monitor the radial velocity of ten
non-transiting planet candidates along their orbits. We additionally used AstraLux to obtain
high-resolution images of some of these candidates to discard blended binaries that contaminate
the Kepler light curves by mimicking planetary signals. Among the ten systems, we confirm three
new hot-Jupiters (KIC8121913 b, KIC10068024 b, and KIC5479689 b) with masses in the range 0.5-2
M$_{\rm Jup}$ and set mass constraints within the planetary regime for the other three candidates
(KIC8026887b, KIC5878307 b, and KIC11362225 b), thus strongly suggestive of their planetary nature.
For the first time, we validate the technique of detecting non-transiting planets via their phase
curve variations. We present the new planetary systems and their properties. We find good agreement
between the RV-derived masses and the photometric masses in all cases except KIC8121913 b, which
shows a significantly lower mass derived from the ellipsoidal modulations than from beaming and
radial velocity data.

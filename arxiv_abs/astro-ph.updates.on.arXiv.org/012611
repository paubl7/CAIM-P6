Operating in an unprecedented contrast regime ($10^{-7}$ to $10^{-9}$), the Roman Coronagraph
Instrument (CGI) will serve as a pathfinder for key technologies needed for future Earth-finding
missions. The Roman Exoplanet Imaging Data Challenge (Roman EIDC) was a community engagement effort
that tasked participants with extracting exoplanets and their orbits for a 47 UMa-like target star,
given: (1) 15 years of simulated precursor radial velocity (RV) data, and (2) six epochs of simulated
imaging taken over the course of the Roman mission. The Roman EIDC simulated images include 4 epochs
with CGI's Hybrid Lyot Coronagraph (HLC) plus 2 epochs with a starshade (SS) assumed to arrive as
part of a Starshade Rendezvous later in the mission. Here, we focus on our in-house analysis of the
outermost planet, for which the starshade's higher throughput and lower noise floor present a factor
of ~4 improvement in signal-to-noise ratio over the narrow-field HLC. We find that, although the
RV detection was marginal, the precursor RV data enable the mass and orbit to be constrained with
only 2 epochs of starshade imaging. Including the HLC images in the analysis results in improved
measurements over RV + SS alone, with the greatest gains resulting from images taken at epochs near
maximum elongation. Combining the two epochs of SS imaging with the RV + HLC data resulted in a factor
of ~2 better orbit and mass determinations over RV + HLC alone. The Roman CGI, combined with precursor
RV data and later mission SS imaging, form a powerful trifecta in detecting exoplanets and determining
their masses, albedos, and system configurations. While the Roman CGI will break new scientific
and technological ground with direct imaging of giant exoplanets within ~5 AU of V~5 and brighter
stars, a Roman Starshade Rendezvous mission would additionally enable the detection of planets
out to ~8 AU in those systems.

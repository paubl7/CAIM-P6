Vortex-flows exist across a broad range of spatial and temporal scales in the solar atmosphere.
Small-scale vortices have been proposed to play an important role in energy transport in the solar
atmosphere. However, their physical properties remain poorly understood due to the limited spatial
resolution of the observations. We aim to explore and analyze the physical properties of small-scale
vortices inside magnetic flux tubes using numerical simulations, and to investigate whether they
contribute to heating the chromosphere in a plage region. Using the three-dimensional (3D) radiative
magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulation code 'MURaM', we perform numerical simulations of a unipolar
solar plage region. To detect and isolate vortices, we use the Swirling Strength criterion and select
the locations where the fluid is rotating with an angular velocity greater than a certain threshold.
We concentrate on small-scale as they are the strongest and carry most of the energy. We explore the
spatial profiles of physical quantities viz. density, horizontal velocity, etc. inside these
vortices. Moreover, to apprehend their general characteristics, a statistical investigation
is performed. Magnetic flux tubes have a complex filamentary substructure harbouring an abundance
of small-scale vortices. At the interfaces between vortices strong current sheets are formed that
may dissipate and heat the solar chromosphere. Statistically, vortices have higher densities
and higher temperatures than the average values at the same geometrical height in the chromosphere.
We conclude that small-scale vortices are ubiquitous in solar plage regions, and they are denser
and hotter structures that contribute to chromospheric heating, possibly by dissipation of the
current sheets formed at their interfaces.

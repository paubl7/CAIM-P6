The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) will be the next generation gamma-ray observatory, which will
consist of three kinds of telescopes of different sizes. Among those, the Large Size Telescope (LST)
will be the most sensitive in the low energy range starting from 20 GeV. The prototype LST (LST-1)
proposed for CTA was inaugurated in October 2018 in the northern hemisphere site, La Palma (Spain),
and is currently in its commissioning phase. MAGIC is a system of two gamma-ray Cherenkov telescopes
of the current generation, located approximately 100 m away from LST-1, that have been operating
in stereoscopic mode since 2009. Since LST-1 and MAGIC can observe the same air shower events, we
can compare the brightness of showers, estimated energies of gamma rays, and other parameters event
by event, which can be used to cross-calibrate the telescopes. Ultimately, by performing combined
analyses of the events triggering the three telescopes, we can reconstruct the shower geometry
more accurately, leading to better energy and angular resolutions, and a better discrimination
of the background showers initiated by cosmic rays. For that purpose, as part of the commissioning
of LST-1, we performed joint observations of established gamma-ray sources with LST-1 and MAGIC.
Also, we have developed Monte Carlo simulations for such joint observations and an analysis pipeline
which finds event coincidence in the offline analysis based on their timestamps. In this work, we
present the first detection of an astronomical source, the Crab Nebula, with combined observation
of LST-1 and MAGIC. Moreover, we show results of the inter-telescope cross-calibration obtained
using Crab Nebula data taken during joint observations with LST-1 and MAGIC.

Previous studies measuring the clustering of submillimeter galaxies (SMGs) have based their measurements
on single-dish detected sources, finding evidence for strong clustering. However, ALMA has revealed
that, due to the coarse angular resolution of these instruments, single-dish sources can be comprised
of multiple sources. This implies that the clustering inferred from single-dish surveys may be
overestimated. Here, we measure the clustering of SMGs based on the ALESS survey, an ALMA follow-up
of sources previously identified in the LABOCA ECDFS Submillimeter Survey (LESS). We present a
method to measure the clustering of ALMA sources that have been previously identified using single-dish
telescopes, based on forward modeling both the single-dish and the ALMA observations. We constrain
upper limits for the median mass of halos hosting SMGs at $1<z<3$, finding $M_{\rm{halo}}\leq2.4\times10^{12}\,\rm\,M_{\odot}$
for SMGs with flux densities $S_{870}\geq4.0\,$mJy, which is at least $3.8^{+3.8}_{-2.6}$ times
lower than the mass inferred based on the clustering of the LESS sources alone. This suggests that
the strength of SMG clustering based on single-dish observations was overestimated and therefore
SMGs might be hosted by dark matter halos less massive than has previously been estimated. By extrapolating
our models down to flux densities of $S_{870}\geq1.2\,\rm\,$mJy, we find that such SMGs inhabit
halos with median mass $M_{\rm{halo}}\leq3.2\times10^{11}\,\rm\,M_{\odot}$. We conclude
that only the brightest ($S_{870}\gtrsim5-6\,\rm\,$mJy) SMGs would trace massive structures
at $z\sim2$ and only SMGs with $S_{870}\gtrsim6\,\rm\,$mJy may be connected to massive local elliptical
galaxies, quasars at intermediate redshifts and high-redshift star-forming galaxies, whereas
fainter SMGs are unlikely linked to these populations.

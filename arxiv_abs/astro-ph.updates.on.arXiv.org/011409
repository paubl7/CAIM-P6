Observations and modelling of stars with near-solar masses in their early phases of evolution is
critical for a better understanding of how dynamos of solar-type stars evolve. We examine the chemical
composition and the spot distribution of the pre-main-sequence solar analogue EK Dra. Using spectra
from the HERMES Spectrograph (La Palma), we obtain the abundances of 23 elements with respect to
the solar ones, which lead to a $[{\rm Fe/H}]=0.03$, with significant overabundance of Li and Ba.
The s-process elements Sr, Y, and Ce are marginally overabundant, while Co, Ni, Cu, Zn are marginally
deficient compared to solar abundances. The overabundance of Ba is most likely due to the assumption
of depth-independent microturbulent velocity. Li abundance is consistent with the age and the
other abundances may indicate distinct initial conditions of the pre-stellar nebula. We estimate
a mass of 1.04 $M_\odot$ and an age of $27^{+11}_{-8}$\,Myr using various spectroscopic and photometric
indicators. We study the surface distribution of dark spots, using 17 spectra collected during
15 nights using the CAFE Spectrograph (Calar Alto). We also conduct flux emergence and transport
(FEAT) simulations for EK Dra's parameters and produce 15-day-averaged synoptic maps of the likely
starspot distributions. Using Doppler imaging, we reconstruct the surface brightness distributions
for the observed spectra and FEAT simulations, which show overall agreement for polar and mid-latitude
spots, while in the simulations there is a lack of low-latitude spots compared to the observed image.
We find indications that cross-equatorial extensions of mid-latitude spots can be artefacts of
the less visible southern-hemisphere activity.

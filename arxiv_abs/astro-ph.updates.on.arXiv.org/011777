Context. Radio relics in galaxy clusters are known to be good laboratories for verification of the
applicability of the diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) model in its canonical version. The need
for such verification stems from the inconsistencies in the shock properties resulting from radio
observations compared to X-ray observations. Aims. In this article we aim to explore how the presence
of a second shock in the vicinity of a relic modifies the spectrum of accelerated electrons and decipher
which of the involved parameters can have a significant impact on their shape. Methods. We analytically
studied DSA of cosmic rays in two stationary shocks aiming to investigate the change of the distribution
function. The latter eventually leads to spectrum slope deviations visible in different observations
and simulations that do not appear to be explained by the case wherein cosmic rays interact with a
single shock wave. Results. We obtain a complex distribution function $f(x,p)$ depending on many
parameters (distance between two shocks, compression ratios, spatial diffusion coefficients,
injection value, etc.). This function reveals modifications that occur because of the coupled
acceleration in both shocks. Apparently, deviations in the particle spectrum from the pure power
law depend on a few parameters such as $Q_{1}/Q_{2} $, $\kappa_{1}/\kappa_{2} $, $r_{1}/r_{2}
$, and $L$. Although we do not verify this idea by taking a particular cluster as an example, we demonstrate
a potential cause of spectral disturbances in radio relics. In general terms, our findings appear
to correlate with results from the literature when the distance between the shocks is of the order
of the width of a radio relic and $\kappa_{1}/\kappa_{2} \propto 3$.

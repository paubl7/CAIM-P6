CONTEXT. The GOSSS spectral classifications and Gaia data have significantly improved our ability
to measure distances and determine memberships of stellar groups with OB stars. AIMS. We have started
a program to identify, measure distances, and determine the membership of Galactic stellar groups
with OB stars. We start with the identification and distance determinations of groups with O stars.
In this paper we concentrate on groups that contain stars with the earliest spectral subtypes. METHODS.
We use GOSSS to select Galactic stellar groups with O2-O3.5 stars and a method that combines Gaia
DR2 photometry, positions, proper motions, and parallaxes to assign robust memberships and measure
distances. We also include the two clusters in that paper to generate our first list of 16 O-type Galactic
stellar groups. RESULTS. We derive distances, determine the membership, and analyze the structure
of sixteen Galactic stellar groups with O stars, Villafranca O-001 to O-016, including the 14 groups
with the earliest-O-type optically-accessible stars known in the Milky Way. We compare our distance
with previous results and establish that the best consistency is with VLBI parallaxes and the worst
is with kinematic distances. Our results indicate that massive stars can form in relatively low-mass
clusters or even in near-isolation, as is the case for the Bajamar star in the North America nebula.
This lends support to the hierarchical scenario of star formation, where some stars are born in well-defined
bound clusters but others are born in associations that are unbound from the beginning: groups of
newborn stars come in many shapes and sizes. We propose that HD 64 568 and HD 64 315 AB could have been
ejected simultaneously from Villafranca O-012 S. Our results are consistent with a difference
of approx. 20 microas in the Gaia DR2 parallax zero point between bright and faint stars. (ABRIDGED)

A radial velocity follow-up of the long-period sdOB+G1V type spectroscopic binary SB 744 revealed
strong lines of fluorine and lead in the optical spectrum of the sdOB star and subsolar metallicity
in the G1V companion. With high-quality observations and Gaia astrometric data, we aim at measuring
the chemical composition and Galactic kinematics of the system to put it in context with known populations
of hot subdwarfs. Such binary systems have high potential, as they give insights into the late stages
of binary evolution as well as into the mysterious formation of stripped core helium-burning stars.
We have analyzed the optical spectra with homogeneous atmospheric models to derive surface parameters
of the binary members from a direct wavelength space decomposition and independently measured
the atmospheric properties of the cool companion. The two independent methods reached consistent
results, which, amended with constraints from spectral energy distributions provided a subdwarf
mass. The Gaia astrometry allowed us to derive the Galactic kinematics of the system. SB 744 turned
out to be an old, Population II system, that has gone through dramatic events. The hot subdwarf star
belongs to the heavy-metal subclass of sdOB stars and we report super-solar abundances of lead,
based on Pb III/IV lines. The He abundance of the hot subdwarf is the lowest among the known heavy-metal
sdOB stars. The presence of fluorine implies that SB 744 was once a hierarchical triple system and
the inner binary has merged in the near past. As an alternative scenario, single-star evolution
through late core helium flash and atmospheric mixing can also produce the observed fluorine abundances.
The atmospheric metal over-abundances currently observed are perhaps the results of a combination
of mixing processes during formation and radiative support.

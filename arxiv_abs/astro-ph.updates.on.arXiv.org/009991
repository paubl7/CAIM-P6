In this study, we independently test the presence of an exoplanet around the binary KIC 9472174,
which is composed of a red dwarf and a pulsating type B subdwarf. We also present the results of our
search for Jupiter-mass objects orbiting near to the eclipsing binary KIC 7975824, which is composed
of a white dwarf and type B subdwarf, and the pulsating white dwarf KIC 8626021. The goal is to test
analytical techniques and prepare the ground for a larger search for possible substellar survivors
on tight orbits around post-common envelope binaries and stars at the end of their evolution, that
is, extended horizontal branch stars and white dwarfs. We, therefore, mainly focus on substellar
bodies orbiting these stars within the range of the host's former red-giant or asymptotic-giant
phase envelopes. Due to the methods we use, the quest is restricted to single-pulsating type B subdwarf
and white dwarf stars and short-period eclipsing binaries containing a white dwarf or a subdwarf
component. Results. Based on the three objects studied in this paper, we demonstrate that these
methods can be used to detect giant exoplanets orbiting around pulsating white dwarf or type B subdwarf
stars as well as short-period binary systems, at distances which fall within the range of the former
red-giant envelope of a single star or the common envelope of a binary. Using our analysis techniques,
we reject the existence of a Jupiter-mass exoplanet around the binary KIC 9472174 at the distance
and orbital period previously suggested in the literature. We also found that the eclipse timing
variations observed in the binary might depend on the reduction and processing of the Kepler data.
The other two objects analyzed in this work do not have Jupiter mass exoplanets orbiting within 0.7
- 1.4 AU from them, or larger-mass objects on closer orbits (the given mass limits are minimum masses).

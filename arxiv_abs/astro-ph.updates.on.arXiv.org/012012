We present element abundance ratios and ionizing radiation of local young low-mass (~$10^{6}$
M_sun) extremely metal poor galaxies (EMPGs) with a 2% solar oxygen abundance (O/H)_sun and a high
specific star-formation rate (sSFR~300 Gyr$^{-1}$), and other (extremely) metal poor galaxies,
which are compiled from Extremely Metal-Poor Representatives Explored by the Subaru Survey (EMPRESS)
and the literature. Weak emission lines such as [FeIII]4658 and HeII4686 are detected in very deep
optical spectra of the EMPGs taken with 8m-class telescopes including Keck and Subaru (Kojima et
al. 2019, Izotov et al. 2018), enabling us to derive element abundance ratios with photoionization
models. We find that neon- and argon-to-oxygen ratios are comparable to those of known local dwarf
galaxies, and that the nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance ratios (N/O) are lower than 20% (N/O)_sun
consistent with the low oxygen abundance. However, the iron-to-oxygen abundance ratios (Fe/O)
of the EMPGs are generally high; the EMPGs with the 2%-solar oxygen abundance show high Fe/O ratios
of ~90-140% (Fe/O)_sun, which are unlikely explained by suggested scenarios of Type Ia supernova
iron productions, iron's dust depletion, and metal-poor gas inflow onto previously metal-riched
galaxies with solar abundances. Moreover, these EMPGs have very high HeII4686/H$\beta$ ratios
of ~1/40, which are not reproduced by existing models of high-mass X-ray binaries whose progenitor
stellar masses are less than 120 M_sun. Comparing stellar-nucleosynthesis and photoionization
models with a comprehensive sample of EMPGs identified by this and previous EMPG studies, we propose
that both the high Fe/O ratios and the high HeII4686/H$\beta$ ratios are explained by the past existence
of super massive ($>$300 M_sun) stars, which may evolve into intermediate-mass black holes ($\gtrsim$100
M_sun).

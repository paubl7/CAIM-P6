We study the role of drift effect in the temporal changes of the anisotropy of galactic cosmic rays
(GCRs) and the influence of the sector structure of the heliospheric magnetic field on it. We analyze
the GCRs anisotropy in the Solar Cycle 24 and solar minimum 23_24 with negative polarity for the period
of 2007-2009 and near minimum 24_25 with positive polarity in 2017-2018 using data of global network
of Neutron Monitors. We use the harmonic analyses method to calculate the radial and tangential
components of the anisotropy of GCRs for different sectors (plus corresponds to the positive and
minus to the negative directions) of the heliospheric magnetic field. We compare the analysis of
GCRs anisotropy using different evaluations of the mean GCRs rigidity related to Neutron Monitor
observations. Then the radial and tangential components are used for characterizing the GCRs modulation
in the heliosphere. We show that in the solar minimum 23_24 in 2007-2009 when negative, the drift
effect is not visibly evident in the changes of the radial component, i.e. the drift effect is found
to produce 4 % change in the radial component of the GCRs anisotropy for 2007-2009. Hence the diffusion
dominated model of GCRs transport is more acceptable in 2007-2009. In turn, near the solar minimum
24_25 in 2017-2018 when positive, the drift effect is evidently visible and produce 40% change in
the radial component of the GCRs anisotropy for 2017-2018. So in the period of 2017-2018 diffusion
model with noticeably manifested drift is acceptable. The results of this work are in good agreement
with the drift theory of GCRs modulation, according to which during negative (positive) polarity
cycles, a drift stream of GCRs is directed toward (away from) the Sun, thus giving rise to a 22-year
cycle variation of the radial GCRs anisotropy.

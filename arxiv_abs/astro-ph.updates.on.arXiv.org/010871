At the time of defining the science objectives of the INTernational Gamma-Ray Astrophysics Laboratory
(INTEGRAL), such a rapid and spectacular development of multi-messenger astronomy could not have
been predicted, with new impulsive phenomena becoming accessible through different channels.
Neutrino telescopes have routinely detected energetic neutrino events coming from unknown cosmic
sources since 2013. Gravitational wave detectors opened a novel window on the sky in 2015 with the
detection of the merging of two black holes and in 2017 with the merging of two neutron stars, followed
by signals in the full electromagnetic range. Finally, since 2007, radio telescopes detected extremely
intense and short burst of radio waves, known as Fast Radio Bursts (FRBs) whose origin is for most
cases extragalactic, but enigmatic. The exceptionally robust and versatile design of the INTEGRAL
mission has allowed researchers to exploit data collected not only with the pointed instruments,
but also with the active cosmic-ray shields of the main instruments to detect impulses of gamma-rays
in coincidence with unpredictable phenomena. The full-sky coverage, mostly unocculted by the
Earth, the large effective area, the stable background, and the high duty cycle (85%) put INTEGRAL
in a privileged position to give a major contribution to multi-messenger astronomy. In this review,
we describe how INTEGRAL has provided upper limits on the gamma-ray emission from black-hole binary
mergers, detected a short gamma-ray burst in coincidence with a binary neutron star merger, contributed
to define the spectral energy distribution of a blazar associated with a neutrino event, set upper
limits on impulsive and steady gamma-ray emission from cosmological FRBs, and detected a magnetar
flare associated with fast radio bursting emission.

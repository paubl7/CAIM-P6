Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) and high speed solar streams serve as perturbations to the background
solar wind that have major implications in space weather dynamics. Therefore, a robust framework
for accurate predictions of the background wind properties is a fundamental step towards the development
of any space weather prediction toolbox. In this pilot study, we focus on the implementation and
comparison of various models that are critical for a steady state, solar wind forecasting framework.
Specifically, we perform case studies on Carrington rotations 2053, 2082 and 2104, and compare
the performance of magnetic field extrapolation models in conjunction with velocity empirical
formulations to predict solar wind properties at Lagrangian point L1. Two different models to extrapolate
the solar wind from the coronal domain to the inner-heliospheric domain are presented, namely,
(a) Kinematics based (Heliospheric Upwind eXtrapolation [HUX]) model and (b) Physics based model.
The physics based model solves a set of conservative equations of hydrodynamics using the PLUTO
code and can additionally predict the thermal properties of solar wind. The assessment in predicting
solar wind parameters of the different models is quantified through statistical measures. We further
extend this developed framework to also assess the polarity of inter-planetary magnetic field
at L1. Our best models for the case of CR2053 gives a very high correlation coefficient ($\sim$ 0.73-0.81)
and has an root mean square error of ($\sim$ 75-90 kms$^{-1}$). Additionally, the physics based
model has a standard deviation comparable with that obtained from the hourly OMNI solar wind data
and also produces a considerable match with observed solar wind proton temperatures measured at
L1 from the same database.

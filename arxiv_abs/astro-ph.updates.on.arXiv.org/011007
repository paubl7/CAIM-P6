Horizon Run 5 (HR5) is a cosmological hydrodynamical simulation which captures the properties
of the Universe on a Gpc scale while achieving a resolution of 1kpc. Inside the simulation box we zoom-in
on a high-resolution cuboid region with a volume of $1049\times114\times114\,{\rm cMpc}^3$.The
sub-grid physics chosen to model galaxy formation includes radiative heating/cooling, UV background,
star formation, supernova feedback, chemical evolution tracking the enrichment of oxygen and
iron, the growth of supermassive black holes and feedback from active galactic nuclei (AGN) in the
form of a dual jet-heating mode. For this simulation we implemented a hybrid MPI-OMP version of RAMSES,
specifically targeted for modern many-core many thread parallel architectures. In addition to
the traditional simulation snapshots, light-cone data was generated on the fly. For the post-processing,
we extended the Friends-of-Friend (FoF) algorithm and developed a new galaxy finder PGalF to analyse
the outputs of HR5. The simulation successfully reproduces observations, such as the cosmic star
formation history and connectivity of galaxy distribution, We identify cosmological structures
at a wide range of scales, from filaments with a length of several cMpc, to voids with a radius of ~100
cMpc. The simulation also indicates that hydrodynamical effects on small scales impact galaxy
clustering up to very large scales near and beyond the baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) scale.
Hence, caution should be taken when using that scale as a cosmic standard ruler: one needs to carefully
understand the corresponding biases. The simulation is expected to be an invaluable asset for the
interpretation of upcoming deep surveys of the Universe.

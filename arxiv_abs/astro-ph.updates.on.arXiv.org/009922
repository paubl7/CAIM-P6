In this work, we use the ASTRAEUS (semi-numerical rAdiative tranSfer coupling of galaxy formaTion
and Reionization in N-body dArk mattEr simUlationS) framework which couples galaxy formation
and reionization in the first billion years. Exploring a number of models for reionization feedback
and the escape fraction of ionizing radiation from the galactic environment ($f_\mathrm{esc}$),
we quantify how the contribution of star-forming galaxies to reionization depends on the radiative
feedback model, $f_\mathrm{esc}$, and the environmental over-density. Our key findings are:
(i) for constant $f_\mathrm{esc}$ models, intermediate-mass galaxies (with halo masses of $M_h\simeq10^{9-11}$M$_\odot$
and absolute UV magnitudes of $M_{UV} \sim -15$ to $-20$) in intermediate-density regions drive
reionization; (iii) scenarios where $f_\mathrm{esc}$ increases with decreasing halo mass shift
the galaxy population driving reionization to lower-mass galaxies ($M_h<10^{9.5}$M$_\odot$)
with lower luminosities ($M_{UV}>-16$) and over-densities; (iii) reionization imprints its
topology on the ionizing emissivity of low-mass galaxies ($M_h<10^{9}$M$_\odot$) through radiative
feedback. Galaxies in over-dense regions (that are reionized earlier) experience a stronger suppression
of star formation by radiative feedback and show lower ionizing emissivities; (iv) therefore,
a change in $f_\mathrm{esc}$ with galaxy properties has the largest impact on the sources of reionization
and their detectability, with the radiative feedback strength and environmental over-density
playing a sub-dominant role; (v) JWST-surveys (with a limiting magnitude of $M_{UV} = -16$) will
be able to detect the galaxies providing $\sim60\%$ ($\sim20\%$) of reionization photons at $z=7$
for constant $f_\mathrm{esc}$ models (scenarios where $f_\mathrm{esc}$ increases with decreasing
halo mass).

Pulsar searches are computationally demanding efforts to discover dispersed periodic signals
in time- and frequency-resolved data from radio telescopes. The complexity and computational
expense of simultaneously determining the frequency-dependent delay (dispersion) and the periodicity
of the signal is further exacerbated by the presence of various types of radio-frequency interference
(RFI) and observing-system effects. New observing systems with wider bandwidths, higher bit rates
and greater overall sensitivity (also to RFI) further enhance these challenges. We present a novel
approach to the analysis of pulsar search data. Specifically, we present a neural-network-based
pipeline that efficiently suppresses a wide range of RFI signals and instrumental instabilities
and furthermore corrects for (a priori unknown) interstellar dispersion. After initial training
of the network, our analysis can be run in real time on a standard desktop computer with a commonly
available, consumer-grade GPU. We complement our neural network with standard algorithms for
periodicity searches. In particular with the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the Fast Folding
Algorithm (FFA) and demonstrate that with these straightforward extensions, our method is capable
of identifying even faint pulsars, while maintaining an extremely low number of false positives.
We furthermore apply our analysis to a subset of the PALFA survey and demonstrate that in most cases
the automated dispersion removal of our network produces a time series of similar quality as dedispersing
using the actual dispersion measure of the pulsar in question. On our test data we are able to make
predictions whether a pulsar is present in the data or not 200 times faster than real time.

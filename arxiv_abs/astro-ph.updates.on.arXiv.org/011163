Teukolsky equations for $|s|=2$ provide efficient ways to solve for curvature perturbations around
Kerr black holes. Imposing regularity conditions on these perturbations on the future (past) horizon
corresponds to imposing an in-going (out-going) wave boundary condition. For exotic compact objects
(ECOs) with external Kerr spacetime, however, it is not yet clear how to physically impose boundary
conditions for curvature perturbations on their boundaries. We address this problem using the
Membrane Paradigm, by considering a family of fiducial observers (FIDOs) that float right above
the horizon of a linearly perturbed Kerr black hole. From the reference frame of these observers,
the ECO will experience tidal perturbations due to in-going gravitational waves, respond to these
waves, and generate out-going waves. As it also turns out, if both in-going and out-going waves exist
near the horizon, the Newman Penrose (NP) quantity $\psi_0$ will be numerically dominated by the
in-going wave, while the NP quantity $\psi_4$ will be dominated by the out-going wave. In this way,
we obtain the ECO boundary condition in the form of a relation between $\psi_0$ and the complex conjugate
of $\psi_4$, in a way that is determined by the ECO's tidal response in the FIDO frame. We explore several
ways to modify gravitational-wave dispersion in the FIDO frame, and deduce the corresponding ECO
boundary condition for Teukolsky functions. We subsequently obtain the boundary condition for
$\psi_4$ alone, as well as for the Sasaki-Nakamura and Detweiler's functions. As it also turns out,
reflection of spinning ECOs will generically mix between different $\ell$ components of the perturbations
fields, and be different for perturbations with different parities. We also apply our boundary
condition to computing gravitational-wave echoes from spinning ECOs, and solve for the spinning
ECOs' quasi-normal modes.

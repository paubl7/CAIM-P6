This work focuses on the combination of White Light (WL) and UV (Ly-alpha) coronagraphic images
to demonstrate the capability to measure the solar wind speed in the inner corona directly with the
ratio between these two images (a technique called "quick inversion method"), thus avoiding to
account for the line-of-sight (LOS) integration effects in the inversion of data. After a derivation
of the theoretical basis and illustration of the main hypotheses in the "quick inversion method",
the data inversion technique is tested first with 1D radial analytic profiles, and then with 3D numerical
MHD simulations, in order to show the effects of variabilities related with different phases of
solar activity cycle and complex LOS distribution of plasma parameters. The same technique is also
applied to average WL and UV images obtained from real data acquired by SOHO UVCS and LASCO instruments
around the minimum and maximum of the solar activity cycle. Comparisons between input and output
velocities show overall a good agreement, demonstrating that this method that allows to infer the
solar wind speed with WL-UV image ratio can be complementary to more complex techniques requiring
the full LOS integration. The analysis described here also allowed us to quantify the possible errors
in the outflow speed, and to identify the coronal regions where the "quick inversion method" performs
at the best. The "quick inversion" applied to real UVCS and LASCO data allowed also to reconstruct
the typical bimodal distribution of fast and slow wind at solar minimum, and to derive a more complex
picture around solar maximum. The application of the technique shown here will be very important
for the future analyses of data acquired with multichannel WL and UV (Ly-alpha) coronagraphs, such
as Metis on-board Solar Orbiter, LST on-board ASO-S, and any other future WL and UV Ly-alpha multi-channel
coronagraph.

Axions are hypothetical particles proposed to solve the strong CP problem in QCD and may constitute
a significant fraction of the dark matter in the Universe. Axions are expected to be produced in neutron
stars and subsequently decay, producing gamma-rays detectable by the Fermi Large Area Telescope
(Fermi-LAT). Considering that light QCD axions, as opposed to axions $>1$eV, may travel a long range
before they decay into gamma rays, neutron stars may appear as a spatially-extended source of gamma
rays. We extend our previous search for gamma rays from axions, based on a point source model, to consider
the neutron star as an extended source of gamma rays. The extended consideration of neutron stars'
leads to higher sensitivity to searches for axions, as it will be shown. We investigate the spatial
emission of gamma rays using phenomenological models of neutron star axion emission. We present
models including the fundamental astrophysics and relativistic, extended gamma-ray emission
from axions around neutron stars. A Monte Carlo simulation of the LAT gives us an expectation for
the extended angular profile and spectrum. For a source of $\simeq$ 100 pc, we predict a mean angular
spread of $\simeq 2^\circ$ with gamma-ray energies in the range 10-200 MeV. We demonstrate the feasibility
of setting more stringent limits for axions in this mass range, excluding a range not probed by observations
before. We consider projected sensitivities for mass limits on axions from J0108-1431. Based on
the extended angular profile of the source, the expected sensitivity of the 95\% CL upper limit on
the axion mass from J0108-1431 is $\lesssim$10 meV. The limit based on 7.9 years of Fermi-LAT data
is 0.76 meV for an inner temperature of the neutron star of 20 MeV.

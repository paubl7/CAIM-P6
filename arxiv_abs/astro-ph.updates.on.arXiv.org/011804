We use combined South Pole Telescope (SPT)+Planck temperature maps to analyze the circumgalactic
medium (CGM) encompassing 138,235 massive, quiescent 0.5 $\leq$ z $\leq$ 1.5 galaxies selected
from data from the Dark Energy Survey (DES) and Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). Images
centered on these galaxies were cut from the 1.85 arcmin resolution SPT-SZ maps with frequency bands
at 95, 150, and 220 GHz. The images were stacked, filtered, and fit with a gray-body dust model to isolate
the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (tSZ) signal, which is proportional to the total energy contained
in the CGM of the galaxies. We detect the tSZ effect around these $M_{\star} = 10^{10.9} M_\odot$
- $10^{12} M_\odot$ galaxies with an overall signal to noise ratio of $10.1\sigma$. This is large
enough to allow us to separate them into 0.1 dex stellar mass bins, with corresponding tSZ detections
of up to $5.6\sigma$. We also detect dust emission in these quiescent galaxies with signal to noise
ratio of $9.8\sigma$, which is significantly brighter at 150GHz, relative to the tSZ signal, than
measured at lower redshifts. We correct for the $0.16$ dex uncertainty in the stellar mass measurements
by parameter fitting for an unconvolved power-law energy-mass relation, $E_{\rm therm} = E_{\rm
therm,peak} \left(M_\star/M_{\star,{\rm peak}} \right)^\alpha$, with the peak stellar mass
distribution of our selected galaxies defined as $M_{\star,{\rm peak}}= 2.3 \times 10^{11} M_\odot$.
This gives fit values of $E_{\rm therm,peak}= 5.98_{-1.00}^{+1.02} \times 10^{60}$ ergs and $\alpha=3.77_{-0.74}^{+0.60}$.
These values are consistent with $z \approx 0$ observations and within the limits of moderate models
of active galactic nuclei (AGN) feedback. We also compute the radial profile of our full sample,
which is similar to that recently measured at lower-redshift by Schaan et al. (2020).

Pulsars show a steady decrease in their rotational frequency, occasionally interrupted by sudden
spin-ups called glitches, whose physical origin is still a mystery. One suggested explanation
for at least the small glitches are starquakes, that is, failures of the solid neutron star crust,
in which the progressive reduction in the centrifugal force deforms the star, stressing the solid
until it breaks. This produces a spin-up, dissipating energy inside the star. We analyze the deformations
produced by the decreasing centrifugal force, modeling the star with a fluid core and a solid crust,
each with uniform density and with the core possibly denser than the crust, as a simple approximation
to the strong density gradient present in real neutron stars. The deformation is qualitatively
different from the previously studied case of equal densities. The former more closely resembles
the behavior of a fluid star, in which the core-crust interface is a surface of constant gravitational
plus centrifugal potential. Regardless of the uncertain breaking strain, the glitch activity
in this model is several orders of magnitude smaller than observed, even if only small glitches are
considered. For a large breaking strain, suggested by simulations, glitches due to starquakes
could be roughly of the correct size but much less frequent than observed glitches. The energy released
in each glitch is much larger than in the model of angular momentum transfer from a faster rotating
superfluid in the inner crust. On the other hand, we cannot rule out that the heating produced by small
starquakes could trigger glitches by allowing neutron superfluid vortices to move. We also confirm
that stresses in the neutron star crust can in principle support an ellipticity much larger than
some observational upper limits from pulsar timing and continuous gravitational wave searches.

The Carina Nebula harbors a large population of high-mass stars, including at least 75 O-type and
Wolf-Rayet stars, but the current census is not complete since further high-mass stars may be hidden
in or behind the dense dark clouds that pervade the association. With the aim of identifying optically
obscured O- and early B-type stars in the Carina Nebula, we performed the first infrared spectroscopic
study of stars in the optically obscured stellar cluster Tr 16-SE, located behind a dark dust lane
south of eta Car. We used the integral-field spectrograph KMOS at the ESO VLT to obtain H- and K-band
spectra with a resolution of R sim 4000 (Delta lambda sim 5 A) for 45 out of the 47 possible OB candidate
stars in Tr 16-SE, and we derived spectral types for these stars. We find 15 stars in Tr 16-SE with spectral
types between O5 and B2 (i.e., high-mass stars with M >= 8 Msun, only two of which were known before.
An additional nine stars are classified as (Ae)Be stars (i.e., intermediate-mass pre-main-sequence
stars), and most of the remaining targets show clear signatures of being late-type stars and are
thus most likely foreground stars or background giants unrelated to the Carina Nebula. Our estimates
of the stellar luminosities suggest that nine of the 15 O- and early B-type stars are members of Tr
16-SE, whereas the other six seem to be background objects. Our study increases the number of spectroscopically
identified high-mass stars (M >= 8 Msun) in Tr 16-SE from two to nine and shows that Tr 16-SE is one of
the larger clusters in the Carina Nebula. Our identification of three new stars with spectral types
between O5 and O7 and four new stars with spectral types O9 to B1 significantly increases the number
of spectroscopically identified O-type stars in the Carina Nebula.

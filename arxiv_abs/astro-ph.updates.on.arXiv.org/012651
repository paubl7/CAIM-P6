Although galactic winds play a critical role in regulating galaxy formation, hydrodynamic cosmological
simulations do not resolve the scales that govern the interaction between winds and the ambient
circumgalactic medium (CGM). We implement the Physically Evolved Wind (PhEW) model of Huang et
al. (2020) in the GIZMO hydrodynamics code and perform test cosmological simulations with different
choices of model parameters and numerical resolution. PhEW adopts an explicit subgrid model that
treats each wind particle as a collection of clouds that exchange mass, metals, and momentum with
their surroundings and evaporate by conduction and hydrodynamic instabilities as calibrated
on much higher resolution cloud scale simulations. In contrast to a conventional wind algorithm,
we find that PhEW results are robust to numerical resolution and implementation details because
the small scale interactions are defined by the model itself. Compared to conventional wind simulations
with the same resolution, our PhEW simulations produce similar galaxy stellar mass functions at
$z\geq 1$ but are in better agreement with low-redshift observations at $M_* < 10^{11}M_\odot$
because PhEW particles shed mass to the CGM before escaping low mass halos. PhEW radically alters
the CGM metal distribution because PhEW particles disperse metals to the ambient medium as their
clouds dissipate, producing a CGM metallicity distribution that is skewed but unimodal and is similar
between cold and hot gas. While the temperature distributions and radial profiles of gaseous halos
are similar in simulations with PhEW and conventional winds, these changes in metal distribution
will affect their predicted UV/X-ray properties in absorption and emission.

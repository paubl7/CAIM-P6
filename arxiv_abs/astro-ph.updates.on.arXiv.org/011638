The discovery of periodicity in the arrival times of the fast radio bursts (FRB) from two repeating
sources poses a potential challenge to oft studied magnetar scenarios. However, models which postulate
that FRB emission results from relativistic magnetized shocks, or magnetic reconnection in a striped
outflow, are not necessarily specific to magnetar engines, instead requiring only the impulsive
injection of relativistic energy into a dense magnetized medium. Motivated thus, we outline a new
scenario in which FRBs are powered by short-lived relativistic outflows ("flares") from accreting
black hole or neutron star systems, which propagate into the cavity of the pre-existing ("quiescent")
jet. In order to reproduce FRB luminosities and rates, we are driven to consider binaries of stellar-mass
compact objects undergoing super-Eddington mass transfer, similar to those which characterize
some ultra-luminous X-ray (ULX) sources. Indeed, the host galaxies of FRBs, and their spatial offsets
within their hosts, show broad similarities to those of ULX. Periodicity on timescales of days to
years could be attributed to precession (e.g., Lens-Thirring) of the polar accretion funnel, along
which the FRB emission is geometrically and relativistically beamed, across the observer line
of sight. Accounting for the most luminous FRBs via accretion power may require a population of binaries
undergoing brief-lived phases of unstable (dynamical timescale) mass transfer. This could lead
to secular evolution in the burst properties of some repeating FRB sources on timescales as short
as months to years, followed by a transient optical/IR counterpart akin to a luminous red nova or
dusty common envelope transient. We encourage targeted FRB searches of known ULX sources.

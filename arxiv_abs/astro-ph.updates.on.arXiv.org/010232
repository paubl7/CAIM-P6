We report the discovery of two transiting brown dwarfs (BDs), TOI-811b and TOI-852b, from NASA's
Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite mission. These two transiting BDs have similar masses,
but very different radii and ages. Their host stars have similar masses, effective temperatures,
and metallicities. The younger and larger transiting BD is TOI-811b at a mass of $M_b = 55.3 \pm 3.2{\rm
M_J}$ and radius of $R_b = 1.35 \pm 0.09{\rm R_J}$ and it orbits its host star in a period of $P = 25.16551
\pm 0.00004$ days. Its age of $93^{+61}_{-29}$ Myr, which we derive from an application of gyrochronology
to its host star, is why this BD's radius is relatively large, not heating from its host star since
this BD orbits at a longer orbital period than most known transiting BDs. This constraint on the youth
of TOI-811b allows us to test substellar mass-radius isochrones where the radius of BDs changes
rapidly with age. TOI-852b is a much older (4.0 Gyr from stellar isochrone models of the host star)
and smaller transiting BD at a mass of $M_b = 53.7 \pm 1.3{\rm M_J}$, a radius of $R_b = 0.75 \pm 0.03{\rm
R_J}$, and an orbital period of $P = 4.94561 \pm 0.00008$ days. TOI-852b joins the likes of other old
transiting BDs that trace out the oldest substellar mass-radius isochrones where contraction
of the BD's radius asymptotically slows. Both host stars have a mass of $M_\star = 1.32{\rm M_\odot}\pm0.05$
and differ in their radii, $T_{\rm eff}$, and [Fe/H] with TOI-811 having $R_\star=1.27\pm0.09{\rm
R_\odot}$, $T_{\rm eff} = 6107 \pm 77$K, and $\rm [Fe/H] = +0.40 \pm 0.09$ and TOI-852 having $R_\star=1.71\pm0.04{\rm
R_\odot}$, $T_{\rm eff} = 5768 \pm 84$K, and $\rm [Fe/H] = +0.33 \pm 0.09$. We take this opportunity
to examine how TOI-811b and TOI-852b serve as test points for young and old substellar isochrones,
respectively.

The chemical composition of planets is inherited from the one of protoplanetary disks at the time
of their formation. Increasing observational evidence suggests that planet formation occurs
in less than $1-2$ Myr. This motivates the need for spatially resolved spectral observations of
young Class I disks, as carried out by the ALMA-DOT campaign in Taurus. In the context of ALMA-DOT,
we observe the edge-on disk around the Class I source IRAS 04302+2247 (the butterfly star) in the
1.3 mm continuum and five molecular lines. We report the first tentative detection of methanol (CH$_3$OH)
in a Class I disk and resolve for the first time the vertical structure of a disk with multiple molecular
tracers. The bulk of the emission in the CO $2-1$, CS $5-4$, and o-H$_2$CO $3_{1,2}-2_{1,1}$ lines
originates from the warm molecular layer, with the line intensity peaking at increasing disk heights,
$z$, for increasing radial distances, $r$. Molecular emission is vertically stratified, with
CO observed at larger disk heights (aperture $z/r \sim 0.41 - 0.45$) compared to both CS and H$_2$CO,
which are nearly co-spatial ($z/r \sim 0.21-0.28$). In the outer midplane, the line emission decreases
due to molecular freeze-out onto dust grains (freeze-out layer) by a factor of $> 100$ (CO) and 15
(CS). H$_2$CO decreases by a factor of only about 2, possibly due to H$_2$CO formation on icy grains,
followed by non-thermal release into gas-phase. The inferred [CH$_3$OH]/[H$_2$CO] abundance
ratio is $0.5-0.6$, which is $1-2$ orders of magnitude lower than for Class 0 hot-corinos, a factor
$\sim 2.5$ lower than the only other value inferred for a protoplanetary disk (in TW Hya, $1.3-1.7$),
and at the lower edge but still consistent with the values in comets. This may indicate that some chemical
reprocessing occurs in disks before the formation of planets and comets.

Magnetic chemically peculiar (mCP) stars exhibit complex atmospheres that allow the investigation
of the interplay of atomic diffusion, magnetic fields, and stellar rotation. A non-uniform surface
distribution of chemical elements and the non-alignment of the rotational and magnetic axes result
in the variability of several observables. Photometrically variable mCP stars are referred to
as alpha2 Canum Venaticorum (ACV) variables. The present work presents a case study of known variables
from the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) survey, with the aim of investigating the survey's suitability
for the detection and study of new ACV variables. Using suitable selection criteria based on the
known characteristics of ACV variables, candidate ACV stars were selected from the ZTF Catalog
of Periodic Variable Stars. All light curves were inspected in detail to select the most promising
candidates. Where available, low-resolution spectra from the LAMOST were employed to classify
the stars on the MK system and confirm their status as mCP stars. We have identified 86 new promising
ACV star candidates. 15 of these stars have LAMOST spectra available, which, in all cases, confirm
them as classical mCP stars, which highlights the viability of our approach. The sample stars can
be sorted into four subgroups characterized by distinct light curve shapes. Anti-phase variations
in different photometric passbands, in particular, is a unique characteristic of a subset of ACV
stars readily usable for their identification. The availability of data in three different passbands
(g, r, and i) is a major advantage of the ZTF survey. On the basis of our experience with other photometric
surveys and the analysis of light curves, we conclude that the ZTF is well suited for the search for,
and the analysis of, ACV variables, which, however, are not considered in the available ZTF variable
star catalogues.

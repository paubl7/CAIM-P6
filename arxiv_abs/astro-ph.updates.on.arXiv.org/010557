Most of the currently known basaltic (V-type) asteroids are believed to be past or present members
of the Vesta dynamical family. The rising discoveries of V-type asteroids that are not dynamically
linked to the Vesta family suggest that a number of major basaltic bodies may have been present during
the early stages of the solar system. In this work, we aim to provide a spectral analysis of 14 V-type
candidates of various dynamical types, selected from the Moving Objects from VISTA Survey (MOVIS)
catalogue. The computed visible and near-infrared (NIR) spectral parameters are used to investigate
evidence of space-weathering or mineralogical differences from the expected basaltic composition.
Based on the analysis of their visible spectra, we confirm 11 new V-type asteroids: six low-i asteroids
- (3188) Jekabsons, (3331) Kvistaberg, (4693) Drummond, (7223) Dolgorukij, (9007) James Bond,
and (29733) 1999 BA4; along with four inner-other asteroids - (5524) Lecacheux, (19983) 1990 DW,
(51742) 2001 KE$_{55}$, and (90023) 2003 BD$_{13}$; as well as one fugitive - (2275) Cuitlahuac.
Additionally, we analysed three peculiar outer main belt candidates based on their visible + NIR
spectra. We confirm the diogenite-like composition of (2452) Lyot. The spectrum of asteroid (7302)
is inconsistent with a basaltic composition and likely reflects an S-type body. The spectrum of
(14390) 1990 QP$_{10}$ shows unique features that suggest a peculiar, unclassified composition.
Overall, our results demonstrate the efficiency of the MOVIS catalogue in identifying V-type objects,
with a success rate of over 85\%. The identification of V-types in the inner main-belt is more likely
due to the presence of the Vesta family and other nearby asteroids that had escaped from the family.
In the middle and outer main belt, where the amount of data is more limited, the proportion of false
positives increases.

Context. A significant fraction of the predicted baryons remains undetected in the local universe.
We adopted the common assumption that a large fraction of the missing baryons corresponds to the
hot (log T(K) = 5.5-7) phase of the Warm Hot Intergalactic Medium (WHIM). We base our missing baryons
search on the scenario whereby the WHIM has been heated up via accretion shocks and galactic outflows,
and is concentrated towards the filaments of the Cosmic Web. Aims. Our aim is to improve the observational
search of the poorly detected hot WHIM. Methods. We detect the filamentary structure within the
EAGLE simulation by applying the Bisous formalism to the galaxy distribution. In addition, we use
the MMF/NEXUS+ classification of the large scale environment of the dark matter component in EAGLE.
We then study the spatio-thermal distribution of the hot baryons within the extracted filaments.
Results. While the filaments occupy only 5% of the full simulation volume, the diffuse hot intergalactic
medium in filaments amounts to 23% $-$ 25% of the total baryon budget, or 79% $-$ 87% of all the hot WHIM.
The most optimal filament sample, with a missing baryon mass fraction of 82%, is obtained by selecting
Bisous filaments with a high galaxy luminosity density. For these filaments we derived analytic
formulae for the radial gas density and temperature profiles, consistent with recent Planck SZ
and CMB lensing observations within the central $r$~ 1 Mpc. Conclusions. Results from EAGLE suggest
that the missing baryons are strongly concentrated towards the filament axes. Since the filament
finding methods used here are applicable to galaxy surveys, a large fraction of the missing baryons
can be localised by focusing the observational efforts on the central 1 Mpc regions of the filaments.
Moreover, focusing on high galaxy luminosity density regions will optimise the observational
signal.

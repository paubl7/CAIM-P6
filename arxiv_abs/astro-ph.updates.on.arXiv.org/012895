The most nearby clusters are the best places to study physical and enrichment effects in the faint
cluster outskirts. A3158 located at z=0.059 is quite extended with a characteristic radius r$_{200}$=23.95
arcmin. In 2019, A3158 was observed as a calibration target in a pointed observation with the eROSITA
telescope onboard the SRG mission. We determined 1d temperature, abundance and normalisation
profiles from eROSITA and XMM-Newton and Chandra data as well as 2d maps of temperature distribution
from eROSITA data. The velocity dispersion was determined and the cluster mass was calculated.
The overall temperature was measured to be 4.725$\pm$ 0.035 keV. The profiles of eROSITA all agree
on a ~10% level with those determined with XMM-Newton and Chandra data. From the temperature map
we see that the cluster lacks a cool core, as noted before. The presence of a previously detected off-centre
cool clump West of the central cluster region is observed. Furthermore there is a bow shaped edge
near the location of the cool gas clump West of the cluster centre. An extension of gas is detected
for the first time further out in the West. The velocity dispersion of the cluster was measured to
be 1058$\pm$41 km s$^{-1}$. The total mass was determined as $M_{200}$=1.38$\pm$ 0.25x10$^{15}$
$M_{\odot}$. The mass estimate from the M-T relation is significantly lower at M$_{200}$=5.09$\pm$
0.59x10$^{14}M_{\odot}$. An extended X-ray source located South of the cluster also coincides
with a galaxy overdensity with redshifts in the range 0.05<z<0.07. These are indications that the
cluster may be undergoing merger activity. Another extended source located North of the cluster
is detected in X-rays and coincides with an overdensity of galaxies with redshifts in the range of
0.070<z<0.077. This is likely a background cluster not related to A3158. Additionally a known SPT
cluster at z=0.53 was detected.

We perform a systematic study of the $^{56}$Ni mass ($M_{\rm Ni}$) of 27 stripped envelope supernovae
(SESNe) by modeling their light-curve tails, highlighting that use of ``Arnett's rule'' overestimates
$M_{\rm Ni}$ for SESN by a factor of $\sim$2. Recently, \citet{Khatami2019} presented a new model
relating the peak time ($t_{\rm p}$) and luminosity ($L_{\rm p}$) of a radioactive-powered SN to
its $M_{\rm Ni}$ that addresses several limitations of Arnett-like models, but depends on a dimensionless
parameter, $\beta$. Using observed $t_{\rm p}$, $L_{\rm p}$, and tail-measured $M_{\rm Ni}$ values
for 27 SESN, we observationally calibrate $\beta$ for the first time. Despite scatter, we demonstrate
that the model of \citet{Khatami2019} with empirically-calibrated $\beta$ values provides significantly
improved measurements of $M_{\rm Ni}$ when only photospheric data is available. However, these
observationally-constrained $\beta$ values are systematically lower than those inferred from
numerical simulations, primarily because the observed sample has significantly higher (0.2-0.4
dex) $L_{\rm p}$ for a given $M_{\rm Ni}$. While effects due to composition, mixing, and asymmetry
can increase $L_{\rm p}$ current models cannot explain the systematically low $\beta$ values.
However, the discrepancy can be alleviated if $\sim$7--50\% of $L_{\rm p}$ for the observed sample
originates from sources other than $^{56}$Ni. Either shock cooling or magnetar spin-down could
provide the requisite luminosity. Finally, we find that even with our improved measurements, the
$M_{\rm Ni}$ values of SESN are still a factor of $\sim$3 larger than those of hydrogen-rich Type
II SN, indicating that these supernovae are inherently different in terms of their progenitor initial
mass distributions or explosion mechanisms.

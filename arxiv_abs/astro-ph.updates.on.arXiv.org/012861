Studying the statistical properties of the large-scale structure in the Universe with weak gravitational
lensing is a prime goal of several current and forthcoming galaxy surveys. The power that weak lensing
has to constrain cosmological parameters can be enhanced by considering statistics beyond second-order
shear correlation functions or power spectra. One such higher-order probe that has proven successful
in observational data is the density split statistics (DSS), in which one analyses the mean shear
profiles around points that are classified according to their foreground galaxy density. In this
paper, we generalise the most accurate DSS model to allow for a broad class of angular filter functions
used for the classification of the different local density regions. This approach is motivated
by earlier findings showing that an optimised filter can provide tighter constraints on model parameters
compared to the standard top-hat case. We build on large deviation theory approaches and approximations
thereof to model the matter density PDF, and on perturbative calculations of higher-order moments
of the density field. The novel addition relies on the generalisation of these previously employed
calculations to allow for general filter functions and is validated on several sets of numerical
simulations. The revised model fits well the simulation measurements, with a residual systematic
offset that is small compared to the statistical accuracy of current weak lensing surveys. The accuracy
of the model is slightly lower for a compensated filter than for a non-negative filter function,
and that it increases with the filter size. Using a Fisher matrix approach, we find constraints comparable
to the commonly used two-point cosmic shear measures. Hence, our DSS model can be used in competitive
analyses of current cosmic shear data, while it may need refinements for forthcoming lensing surveys.

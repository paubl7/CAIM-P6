Mergers of black hole-neutron star (BHNS) binaries are expected to be observed by gravitational
wave (GW) detectors in the coming years. Such observations will not only provide confirmation that
these systems exist, but will also give unique insights into the death and lives of massive (binary)
stars and their possible association with gamma-ray bursts, r-process enrichment, and kilonovae.
Here we present binary population synthesis of isolated BHNS systems in order to predict their merger
rate and characteristics for ground-based GW observatories. We present the results for 420 different
model permutations that explore key uncertainties in our assumptions about massive binary star
evolution (e.g., mass transfer, common-envelope evolution, supernovae), and in our assumptions
for the metallicity-specific star formation rate density, and characterize their relative impacts
on our predictions. We predict intrinsic local BHNS merger rates in the range $\mathcal{R}_{\rm{m}}^0
\approx 4$-$830\,\rm{Gpc}^{-3}\,\rm{yr}^{-1}$ and detected rates in the range $\mathcal{R}_{\rm{det}}
\approx 1$-$180\, \rm{yr}^{-1}$ for a GW network consisting of LIGO, Virgo and KAGRA at design sensitivity.
We find that the binary evolution and metallicity-specific star formation rate density each impact
the predicted merger rates by order $\mathcal{O}(10)$. We also present predictions for the GW detected
BHNS merger properties and find that all 420 model variations predict that $\lesssim 5\%$ of the
BHNS mergers have BH masses $\gtrsim 18\,M_{\odot}$, total masses $\gtrsim 20\,M_{\odot}$, chirp
masses $\gtrsim 5.5\,M_{\odot}$, mass ratios $\gtrsim 12$ or $\lesssim 2$. Moreover, we find that
massive NSs $ > 2\,M_{\odot}$ are expected to be commonly detected in BHNS mergers in almost all our
model variations. Finally, a wide range of $\sim$ 0%-70% of the BHNS mergers are predicted to eject
mass during the merger.

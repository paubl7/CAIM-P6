Context: On 26-27 January 2020, the wide-field imager WISPR on Parker Solar Probe (PSP) observed
a coronal mass ejection (CME) from a distance of approximately 30 solar radii as it passed through
the instrument's 95 degree field-of-view, providing an unprecedented view of the flux rope morphology
of the CME's internal structure. The same CME was seen by STEREO, beginning on 25 January. Aims: Our
goal was to understand the origin and determine the trajectory of this CME. Methods: We analyzed
data from three well-placed spacecraft: Parker Solar Probe (PSP), Solar Terrestrial Relations
Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A), and Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). The CME trajectory was determined
using the method described in Liewer et al. (2020) and verified using simultaneous images of the
CME propagation from STEREO-A. The fortuitous alignment with STEREO-A also provided views of coronal
activity leading up to the eruption. Observations from SDO, in conjunction with potential magnetic
field models of the corona, were used to analyze the coronal magnetic evolution for the three days
leading up to the flux rope ejection from the corona on 25 January. Results: We found that the 25 January
CME is likely the end result of a slow magnetic flux rope eruption that began on 23 January and was observed
by STEREO-A/Extreme Ultraviolet Imager (EUVI). Analysis of these observations suggest that the
flux rope was apparently constrained in the corona for more than a day before its final ejection on
25 January. STEREO-A/COR2 observations of swelling and brightening of the overlying streamer
for several hours prior to eruption on January 25 led us to classify this as a streamer-blowout CME.
The analysis of the SDO data suggests that restructuring of the coronal magnetic fields caused by
an emerging active region led to the final ejection of the flux rope.

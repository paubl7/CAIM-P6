XRISM is an X-ray astronomical mission by the JAXA, NASA, ESA and other international participants,
that is planned for launch in 2022 (Japanese fiscal year), to quickly restore high-resolution X-ray
spectroscopy of astrophysical objects. To enhance the scientific outputs of the mission, the Science
Operations Team (SOT) is structured independently from the instrument teams and the Mission Operations
Team. The responsibilities of the SOT are divided into four categories: 1) guest observer program
and data distributions, 2) distribution of analysis software and the calibration database, 3)
guest observer support activities, and 4) performance verification and optimization activities.
As the first step, lessons on the science operations learned from past Japanese X-ray missions are
reviewed, and 15 kinds of lessons are identified. Among them, a) the importance of early preparation
of the operations from the ground stage, b) construction of an independent team for science operations
separate from the instrument development, and c) operations with well-defined duties by appointed
members are recognized as key lessons. Then, the team structure and the task division between the
mission and science operations are defined; the tasks are shared among Japan, US, and Europe and
are performed by three centers, the SOC, SDC, and ESAC, respectively. The SOC is designed to perform
tasks close to the spacecraft operations, such as spacecraft planning, quick-look health checks,
pre-pipeline processing, etc., and the SDC covers tasks regarding data calibration processing,
maintenance of analysis tools, etc. The data-archive and user-support activities are covered
both by the SOC and SDC. Finally, the science-operations tasks and tools are defined and prepared
before launch.

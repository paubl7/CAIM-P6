We recently found the globular cluster (GC) EXT8 in M31 to have an extremely low metallicity of [Fe/H]=-2.91+/-0.04
using high-resolution spectroscopy. Here we present a colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) for EXT8,
obtained with the Wide Field Camera 3 on board the Hubble Space Telescope. Compared with the CMDs
of metal-poor Galactic GCs, we find that the upper red giant branch (RGB) of EXT8 is about 0.03 mag
bluer in F606W-F814W and slightly steeper, as expected from the low spectroscopic metallicity.
The observed colour spread on the upper RGB is consistent with being caused entirely by the measurement
uncertainties, and we place an upper limit of sigma(F606W-F814W)=0.015 mag on any intrinsic colour
spread. The corresponding metallicity spread can be up to sigma([Fe/H])=0.2 dex or >0.7 dex, depending
on the isochrone library adopted. The horizontal branch (HB) is located mostly on the blue side of
the instability strip and has a tail extending to at least M(F606W)=+3, as in the Galactic GC M15.
We identify two candidate RR Lyrae variables and several UV-luminous post-HB/post AGB star candidates,
including one very bright (M(F300X)=-3.2) source near the centre of EXT8. The surface brightness
of EXT8 out to a radius of 25 arcsec is well fitted by a Wilson-type profile with an ellipticity of epsilon=0.20,
a semi-major axis core radius of 0.25", and a central surface brightness of 15.2 mag per square arcsec
in the F606W band, with no evidence of extra-tidal structure. Overall, EXT8 has properties consistent
with it being a "normal", but very metal-poor GC, and its combination of relatively high mass and
very low metallicity thus remains challenging to explain in the context of GC formation theories
operating within the hierarchical galaxy assembly paradigm.

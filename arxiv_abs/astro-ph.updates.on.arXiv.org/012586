Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are a manifestation of the Sun's eruptive nature. They can have a great
impact on Earth, but also on human activity in space and on the ground. Therefore, modelling their
evolution as they propagate through interplanetary space is essential. EUropean Heliospheric
FORecasting Information Asset (EUHFORIA) is a data-driven, physics-based model, tracing the
evolution of CMEs through background solar wind conditions. It employs a spheromak flux rope, which
provides it with the advantage of reconstructing the internal magnetic field configuration of
CMEs. This is something that is not included in the simpler cone CME model used so far for space weather
forecasting. This work aims at assessing the spheromak CME model included in EUHFORIA. We employed
the spheromak CME model to reconstruct a well observed CME and compare model output to in situ observations.
We focus on an eruption from 6 January 2013 encountered by two radially aligned spacecraft, Venus
Express and STEREO-A. We first analysed the observed properties of the source of this CME eruption
and we extracted the CME properties as it lifted off from the Sun. Using this information, we set up
EUHFORIA runs to model the event. The model predicts arrival times from half to a full day ahead of
the in situ observed ones, but within errors established from similar studies. In the modelling
domain, the CME appears to be propagating primarily southward, which is in accordance with white-light
images of the CME eruption close to the Sun. In order to get the observed magnetic field topology,
we aimed at selecting a spheromak rotation angle for which the axis of symmetry of the spheromak is
perpendicular to the direction of the polarity inversion line (PIL). The modelled magnetic field
profiles, their amplitude, arrival times, and sheath region length are all affected by the choice
of radius of the modelled spheromak.

We use two hydrodynamical simulations (with and without photoionising feedback) of the self-consistent
evolution of molecular clouds (MCs) undergoing global hierarchical collapse (GHC), to study the
effect of the feedback on the structural and kinematic properties of the gas and the stellar clusters
formed in the clouds. During this early stage, the evolution of the two simulations is very similar
(implying that the feedback from low mass stars does not affect the cloud-scale evolution significantly)
and the star-forming region accretes faster than it can convert gas to stars, causing the instantaneous
measured star formation efficiency (SFE) to remain low even in the absence of significant feedback.
Afterwards, the ionising feedback first destroys the filamentary supply to star-forming hubs
and ultimately removes the gas from it, thus first reducing the star formation (SF) and finally halting
it. The ionising feedback also affects the initial kinematics and spatial distribution of the forming
stars, because the gas being dispersed continues to form stars, which inherit its motion. In the
non-feedback simulation, the groups remain highly compact and do not mix, while in the run with feedback,
the gas dispersal causes each group to expand, and the cluster expansion thus consists of the combined
expansion of the groups. Most secondary star-forming sites around the main hub are also present
in the non-feedback run, implying a primordial rather than triggered nature. We do find one example
of a peripheral star-forming site that appears only in the feedback run, thus having a triggered
origin. However, this appears to be the exception rather than the rule, although this may be an artifact
of our simplified radiative transfer scheme.

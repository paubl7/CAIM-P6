Due to their production sites, as well as to how they are processed and destroyed in stars, the light
elements are excellent tools to investigate a number of crucial issues in modern astrophysics:
from stellar structure and non-standard processes in stellar interiors to age dating of stars;
from pre-main sequence evolution to the star formation histories of young clusters and associations
and to multiple populations in globular clusters; from Big Bang nucleosynthesis to the formation
and chemical enrichment history of the Milky Way Galaxy, just to cite some relevant examples. In
this paper, we focus on lithium, beryllium, and boron and on carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. LiBeB
are rare elements, with negligible abundances with respect to hydrogen; on the contrary, CNO are
among the most abundant elements in the Universe. Pioneering observations of light-element surface
abundances in stars started almost 70 years ago and huge progress has been achieved since then. Indeed,
for different reasons, precise measurements of LiBeB and CNO are difficult, even in our Sun; however,
the advent of state-of-the-art ground- and space-based instrumentation has allowed the determination
of high-quality abundances in stars of different type, belonging to different Galactic populations.
Noticeably, the recent large spectroscopic surveys performed with multifiber spectrographs
have yielded detailed and homogeneous information on the abundances of Li and CNO for statistically
significant samples of stars; this has allowed us to obtain new results and insights and, at the same
time, raise new questions and challenges. A complete understanding of the light-element patterns
and evolution in the Universe has not been still achieved. Perspectives for further progress will
open up soon thanks to the new generation instrumentation that is under development and will come
online in the coming years.

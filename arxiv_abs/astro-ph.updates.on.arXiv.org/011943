Recently, there has been an increased interest in the study of the generation of low-energy cosmic
rays (CRs; < 1 TeV) in shocks situated on the surface of a protostar or along protostellar jets. These
locally accelerated CRs offer an attractive explanation for the high levels of non-thermal emission
and ionisation rate, $\zeta$, observed close to these sources. The high $\zeta$ observed in some
protostellar sources is generally attributed to shock-generated UV photons. The aim of this article
is to show that when synchrotron emission and a high $\zeta$ are measured in the same spatial region,
a locally shock-accelerated CR flux is sufficient to explain both phenomena. We assume that relativistic
particles are accelerated according to the first-order Fermi acceleration mechanism and compute
$\zeta$ and the non-thermal emission at cm wavelengths. We then apply our model to the star-forming
region OMC-2 FIR 3/FIR 4. Using a Bayesian analysis, we constrain the parameters of the model and
estimate the spectral indices of the non-thermal radio emission. We demonstrate that the local
CR acceleration model makes it possible to simultaneously explain the synchrotron emission along
the HOPS 370 jet within the FIR 3 region and $\zeta$ observed near the FIR 4 protocluster. Our model
constrains the magnetic field strength (~250-450$~\mu$G), its turbulent component (~20-40$~\mu$G),
and the jet velocity in the shock reference frame for the three non-thermal sources of the HOPS 370
jet (~350-1000 km s$^{-1}$). Beyond the modelling of the OMC-2 FIR 3/FIR 4 system, we show how the
combination of continuum observations at cm wavelengths and molecular transitions is a powerful
new tool for the analysis of star-forming regions: these two types of observations can be simultaneously
interpreted by invoking only the presence of locally accelerated CRs, without having to resort
to shock-generated UV photons.

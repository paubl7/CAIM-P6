The EU funded the FLARECAST project, that ran from Jan 2015 until Feb 2018. FLARECAST had a R2O focus,
and introduced several innovations into the discipline of solar flare forecasting. FLARECAST
innovations were: first, the treatment of hundreds of physical properties viewed as promising
flare predictors on equal footing, extending multiple previous works; second, the use of fourteen
(14) different ML techniques, also on equal footing, to optimize the immense Big Data parameter
space created by these many predictors; third, the establishment of a robust, three-pronged communication
effort oriented toward policy makers, space-weather stakeholders and the wider public. FLARECAST
pledged to make all its data, codes and infrastructure openly available worldwide. The combined
use of 170+ properties (a total of 209 predictors are now available) in multiple ML algorithms, some
of which were designed exclusively for the project, gave rise to changing sets of best-performing
predictors for the forecasting of different flaring levels. At the same time, FLARECAST reaffirmed
the importance of rigorous training and testing practices to avoid overly optimistic pre-operational
prediction performance. In addition, the project has (a) tested new and revisited physically intuitive
flare predictors and (b) provided meaningful clues toward the transition from flares to eruptive
flares, namely, events associated with coronal mass ejections (CMEs). These leads, along with
the FLARECAST data, algorithms and infrastructure, could help facilitate integrated space-weather
forecasting efforts that take steps to avoid effort duplication. In spite of being one of the most
intensive and systematic flare forecasting efforts to-date, FLARECAST has not managed to convincingly
lift the barrier of stochasticity in solar flare occurrence and forecasting: solar flare prediction
thus remains inherently probabilistic.

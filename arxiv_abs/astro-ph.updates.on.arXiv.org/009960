The LOFAR Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) will map the complete Northern sky and provide an excellent
opportunity to study the distribution and evolution of the large-scale structure of the Universe.
We study the completeness of the LoTSS first data release (DR1) and find a point-source completeness
of 99 % above flux densities of 0.8 mJy and define a suite of quality cuts. We determine the count-in-cell
statistics and differential source counts statistic and measure the angular two-point correlation
function of the LoTSS radio sources. The counts-in-cell statistic reveals that the distribution
of radio sources cannot be described by a spatial Poisson process. Instead, a good fit is provided
by a compound Poisson distribution. The differential source counts are in good agreement with previous
findings in deep fields at low radio frequencies and with simulated catalogues from the SKA design
study sky and the Tiered Radio Extragalactic Continuum Simulation. The angular two-point correlation
is $<10^{-2}$ at angular scales $> 1$ deg. Restricting the value added source catalogue to low-noise
regions and a flux density threshold of 2 mJy provides our most reliable estimate of the angular two-point
correlation. For smaller flux density thresholds systematic issues are identified, most likely
related to the flux density calibration of the individual pointings. Based on the distribution
of photometric redshifts of LoTSS sources and the Planck 2018 best-fit cosmological model, the
theoretically predicted angular two-point correlation between 0.1 deg and 6 deg agrees with the
measured clustering for a subsample of radio sources with redshift information. We find agreement
with the expectation of large-scale statistical isotropy of the radio sky at the per cent level.
The angular two-point correlation agrees well with the expectation of the cosmological standard
model. (abbreviated)

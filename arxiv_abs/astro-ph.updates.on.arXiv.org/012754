Gamma-ray bursts - the most luminous explosions in the Universe - are produced as a result of cataclysmic
events such as the collapse of a massive star or the merger of two neutron stars. We monitored the position
of the close-by (about 370 Megaparsecs) gamma-ray burst GRB~190829A, which originated from a massive
star collapse, through very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations with the European
VLBI Network and the Very Long Baseline Array, involving a total of 30 telescopes across four continents.
We carried out a total of 9 observations between 9 and 117 days after the gamma-ray burst at 5 and 15
GHz, reaching an overall excellent resolution. From a state-of-the art analysis of these data,
we obtained valuable information on the source size and expansion rate. The measurements are in
remarkable agreement with the size evolution entailed by a detailed modelling of the multi-wavelength
light curves with a forward plus reverse shock model, which agrees with the observations across
almost 18 orders of magnitude in frequency (including the High Energy Stereoscopic System data
at teraelectronvolt photon energies) and more than 4 orders of magnitude in time. Thanks to the multi-wavelength,
high-cadence coverage of the afterglow, inherent degeneracies in the afterglow model are broken
to a large extent, allowing us to capture some unique physical insights: we find a low prompt emission
efficiency $\lesssim 10^{-3}$; we constrain the fraction of electrons that are accelerated to
relativistic speeds in the forward shock downstream to be $\chi_e<13\%$ at the 90\% confidence
level; we find that the magnetic field energy density in the reverse shock downstream must decay
rapidly after the shock crossing.

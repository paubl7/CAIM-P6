The detection of mixed modes in red giants with space missions CoRoT and Kepler has revealed their
deep internal structure. These modes allow us to characterize the pattern of pressure modes (through
the measurement of their asymptotic frequency separation $\Delta\nu$) and the pattern of gravity
modes (through the determination of their asymptotic period spacing $\Delta\Pi_1$). It has been
shown that red giant branch (RGB) stars regroup on a well-defined sequence in the $\Delta\nu$-$\Delta\Pi_1$
plane. Our first goal is to theoretically explain the features of this sequence and understand how
it can be used to probe the interiors of red giants. Using a grid of red giant models computed with MESA,
we demonstrate that red giants join the $\Delta\nu$-$\Delta\Pi_1$ sequence whenever electron
degeneracy becomes strong in the core. We argue that this can be used to estimate the central densities
of these stars, and potentially to measure the amount of core overshooting during the main sequence
part of the evolution. We also investigate a puzzling subsample of red giants that are located below
the RGB sequence, in contradiction with stellar evolution models. After checking the measurements
of the asymptotic period spacing for these stars, we show that they are mainly intermediate-mass
red giants. This is doubly peculiar because these stars should have non-degenerate cores and are
expected to be located well above the RGB sequence. We show that these peculiarities are well accounted
for if these stars result from the interaction between two low-mass ($M\lesssim2\,M_\odot$) close
companions during the red giant branch phase. If the secondary component has already developed
a degenerate core before mass transfer begins, it becomes an intermediate-mass giant with a degenerate
core. The secondary star is then located below the degenerate sequence, in agreement with the observations.

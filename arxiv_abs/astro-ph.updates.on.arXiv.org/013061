We use field-level forward models of galaxy clustering and the EFT likelihood formalism to study,
for the first time for self-consistently simulated galaxies, the relations between the linear
$b_1$ and second-order bias parameters $b_2$ and $b_{K^2}$. The forward models utilize all of the
information available in the galaxy distribution up to a given order in perturbation theory, which
allows us to infer these bias parameters with high signal-to-noise, even from relatively small
volumes ($L_{\rm box} = 205{\rm Mpc}/h$). We consider galaxies from the IllustrisTNG simulations,
and our main result is that the $b_2(b_1)$ and $b_{K^2}(b_1)$ relations obtained from gravity-only
simulations for total mass selected objects are broadly preserved for simulated galaxies selected
by stellar mass, star formation rate, color and black hole accretion rate. We also find good agreement
between the bias relations of the simulated galaxies and a number of recent estimates for observed
galaxy samples. The consistency under different galaxy selection criteria suggests that theoretical
priors on these bias relations may be used to improve cosmological constraints based on observed
galaxy samples. We do identify some small differences between the bias relations in the hydrodynamical
and gravity-only simulations, which we show can be linked to the environmental dependence of the
relation between galaxy properties and mass. We also show that the EFT likelihood recovers the value
of $\sigma_8$ to percent-level from various galaxy samples (including splits by color and star
formation rate) and after marginalizing over 8 bias parameters. This demonstration using simulated
galaxies adds to previous works based on halos as tracers, and strengthens further the potential
of forward models to infer cosmology from galaxy data.

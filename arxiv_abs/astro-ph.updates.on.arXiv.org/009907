Radiative mixing layers arise wherever multiphase gas, shear, and radiative cooling are present.
Simulations show that in steady state, thermal advection from the hot phase balances radiative
cooling in the front. However, many features are puzzling. For instance, hot gas entrainment appears
to be numerically converged despite the scale-free, fractal structure of such fronts implying
that they should be unresolved. Additionally, the hot gas heat flux has a characteristic velocity
$v_{\rm in} \approx c_{\rm s,c} (t_{\rm cool}/t_{\rm sc,c})^{-1/4}$ whose strength and scaling
are not intuitive. We revisit these issues in 1D and 3D hydrodynamic simulations. Low resolution
leads to numerical diffusion (from truncation error) and dispersion (from stiff source terms).
We find that over-cooling only happens if numerical diffusion dominates thermal transport; convergence
is still possible even when the Field length is unresolved. A deeper physical understanding of radiative
fronts can be obtained by exploiting parallels between mixing layers and turbulent combustion,
which has well-developed theory and abundant experimental data. A key parameter is the Damkohler
number ${\rm Da} = \tau_{\rm turb}/t_{\rm cool}$, the ratio of the outer eddy turnover time to the
cooling time. Once ${\rm Da} > 1$, the front fragments into a multiphase medium. Just as for scalar
mixing, the eddy turnover time sets the mixing rate, independent of small scale diffusion. For this
reason, thermal conduction often has limited impact. We show that $v_{\rm in}$ and the effective
emissivity can be understood in detail by adapting combustion theory scalings. Mean density and
temperature profiles can also be reproduced well by mixing length theory. These results have implications
for the structure and survival of cold gas in many settings, and resolution requirements for large
scale galaxy simulations.

We present results on the properties of neon emission in $z\sim2$ star-forming galaxies drawn from
the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey. Doubly-ionized neon ([NeIII]3869) is detected
at $\geq3\sigma$ in 61 galaxies, representing $\sim$25% of the MOSDEF sample with H$\alpha$, H$\beta$,
and [OIII]$5007$ detections at similar redshifts. We consider the neon emission-line properties
of both individual galaxies with [NeIII]3869 detections and composite $z\sim2$ spectra binned
by stellar mass. With no requirement of [NeIII]3869 detection, the latter provide a more representative
picture of neon emission-line properties in the MOSDEF sample. The [NeIII]3869/[OII]3727 ratio
(Ne3O2) is anti-correlated with stellar mass in $z\sim2$ galaxies, as expected based on the mass-metallicity
relation. It is also positively correlated with the [OIII]$5007$/[OII]$3727$ ratio (O32), but
$z\sim2$ line ratios are offset towards higher Ne3O2 at fixed O32, compared with both local star-forming
galaxies and individual H~II regions. Despite the offset towards higher Ne3O2 at fixed O32 at $z\sim2$,
biases in inferred Ne3O2-based metallicity are small. Accordingly, Ne3O2 may serve as an important
metallicity indicator deep into the reionization epoch. Analyzing additional rest-optical line
ratios including [NeIII]$3869$/[OIII]$5007$ (Ne3O3) and [OIII]$5007$/H$\beta$ (O3H$\beta$),
we conclude that the nebular emission-line ratios of $z\sim2$ star-forming galaxies suggest a
harder ionizing spectrum (lower stellar metallicity, i.e., Fe/H) at fixed gas-phase oxygen abundance,
compared to systems at $z\sim0$. These new results based on neon lend support to the physical picture
painted by oxygen, nitrogen, hydrogen, and sulfur emission, of an ionized ISM in high-redshift
star-forming galaxies irradiated by chemically young, $\alpha$-enhanced massive stars.

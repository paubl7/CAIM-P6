The treatment and criteria for development of unstable Roche lobe overflow (RLOF) that leads to
the common envelope (CE) phase have hindered the evolutionary predictions for decades. In particular,
the formation of black hole-black hole (BH-BH), black hole-neutron star (BH-NS), and neutron star-neutron
star (NS-NS) merging binaries depends sensitively on the CE phase in classical isolated binary
evolution model. All these mergers are now reported as LIGO/Virgo sources or source candidates.
CE is even considered by some as a mandatory phase in the formation of BH-BH, BH-NS or NS-NS mergers
in binary evolution. At the moment, there is no full first-principles model for development of CE.
We employ the Startrack population synthesis code to test the current advancements in studies on
stability of RLOF for massive donors to assess their effect on LIGO/Virgo source population. In
particular, we allow for more restrictive CE development criteria for massive donors. We also test
a modified condition for switching between different types of stable mass transfer. We show how
the revised CE development criteria and modified condition to switch from thermal timescale mass
transfer to nuclear timescale mass transfer affect BH-BH, BH-NS and NS-NS local merger rate density,
fraction of unequal mass BH-BH and BH-NS mergers, and the shape of the mass distribution of BH-BH
mergers. We find that the changes in highly uncertain assumptions on RLOF physics may significantly
affect (i) local merger rate density, (ii) shape of the mass and mass ratio distributions, and (iii)
dominant evolutionary formation (withand without CE) scenarios of LIGO/Virgo sources. Our results
demonstrate that without sufficiently strong constraints on RLOF physics, one is not able to draw
fully reliable conclusions about the population of double compact object systems based on population
synthesis studies.

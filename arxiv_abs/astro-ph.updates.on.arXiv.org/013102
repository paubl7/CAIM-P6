We make use of multi-wavelength data of a large hyperluminous infrared (HLIRG) sample to derive
their main physical properties, e.g., stellar mass, star-formation rate (SFR), volume density,
contribution to the cosmic stellar mass density and to the cosmic SFR density. We also study the black
hole (BH) growth rate and its relationship with the SFR of the host galaxy. We select 526 HLIRGs in
three deep fields (Bo$\"o$tes, Lockman-Hole, ELAIS-N1) and adopt two spectral energy distribution
(SED) fitting codes, CIGALE, which assumes energy balance, and CYGNUS, which is based on radiative
transfer models and does not adopt energy balance principle. We use two different active galactic
nucleus (AGN) models in CIGALE and three AGN models in CYGNUS to compare the results estimated using
different SED fitting codes and different AGN models. The stellar mass, total IR luminosity and
AGN luminosity agree well between different models with a typical median offset of 0.1 dex. The SFR
estimates show the largest dispersions (up to 0.5 dex). This dispersion has an impact on the subsequent
analysis, which may suggest that previous contradictory results could partly be due to different
choices of methods. HLIRGs are ultra-massive galaxies with 99% of them having stellar masses larger
than $10^{11} M_{\odot}$. Our results reveal a higher space density of ultra-massive galaxies
than found in previous surveys or predicted by simulations. We find that HLIRGs contribute more
to the cosmic SFR density as redshift increases. In terms of BH growth, the two SED fitting methods
provide different results. We can see a clear trend in which SFR decreases as AGN luminosity increases
when using CYGNUS estimates, possibly implying quenching by AGN, while this trend is much weaker
when using CIGALE estimates. This difference is also influenced by the dispersion between SlFR
estimates obtained by the two codes.

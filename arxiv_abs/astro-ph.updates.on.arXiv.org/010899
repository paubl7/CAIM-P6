Prominences in the solar atmosphere represent an intriguing and delicate balance of forces and
thermodynamics in an evolving magnetic topology. How this relatively cool material comes to reside
at coronal heights, and what drives its evolution prior to, during, and after its appearance remains
an area full of open questions. We deliberately focus on the levitation-condensation scenario,
where a coronal flux rope forms and eventually demonstrates in-situ condensations, revisiting
it at extreme resolutions down to order 6 km in scale. We perform grid-adaptive numerical simulations
in a 2.5D translationally invariant setup, where we can study the distribution of all metrics involved
in advanced magnetohydrodynamic stability theory for nested flux rope equilibria. We quantify
in particular Convective Continuum Instability (CCI), Thermal Instability (TI), baroclinicity,
and mass-slipping metrics within a series of numerical simulations of prominences formed via levitation-condensation.
Overall, we find that the formation and evolution of prominence condensations happens in a clearly
defined sequence regardless of resolution or background field strength between 3 and 10 Gauss.
The CCI governs the slow evolution of plasma prior to the formation of distinct condensations found
to be driven by the TI. Evolution of the condensations towards the topological dips of the magnetic
flux rope is a consequence of these condensations forming initially outside of pressure balance
with their surroundings. From the baroclinicity distributions, smaller-scale rotational motions
are inferred within forming and evolving condensations. Upon the complete condensation of a prominence
`monolith', the slow descent of this plasma towards lower heights appears consistent with the mass-slippage
mechanism driven by episodes of both local current diffusion and magnetic reconnection.

Context: Resistive Ohmic dissipation has been suggested as a mechanism for heating the solar chromosphere,
but few studies have established this association. Aim: We aim to determine how Ohmic dissipation
by electric currents can heat the solar chromosphere. Methods: We combine high-resolution spectroscopic
Ca II data from the Dunn Solar Telescope and vector magnetic field observations from the Helioseismic
and Magnetic Imager (HMI) to investigate thermal enhancements in a sunspot light bridge. The photospheric
magnetic field from HMI was extrapolated to the corona using a non-force-free field technique that
provided the three-dimensional distribution of electric currents, while an inversion of the chromospheric
Ca II line with a local thermodynamic equilibrium and a nonlocal thermodynamic equilibrium spectral
archive delivered the temperature stratifications from the photosphere to the chromosphere.
Results: We find that the light bridge is a site of strong electric currents, of about 0.3 A/m^2 at
the bottom boundary, which extend to about 0.7 Mm while decreasing monotonically with height. These
currents produce a chromospheric temperature excess of about 600-800 K relative to the umbra. Only
the light bridge, where relatively weak and highly inclined magnetic fields emerge over a duration
of 13 hr, shows a spatial coincidence of thermal enhancements and electric currents. The temperature
enhancements and the Cowling heating are primarily confined to a height range of 0.4-0.7 Mm above
the light bridge. The corresponding increase in internal energy of 200 J/m^3 can be supplied by the
heating in about 10 min. Conclusions: Our results provide direct evidence for currents heating
the lower solar chromosphere through Ohmic dissipation.

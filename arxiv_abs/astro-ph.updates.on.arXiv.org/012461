We present the most detailed data-driven exploration of cloud opacity in a substellar object to-date.
We have tested over 60 combinations of cloud composition and structure, particle size distribution,
scattering model, and gas phase composition assumptions against archival $1-15 {\rm \mu m}$ spectroscopy
for the unusually red L4.5~dwarf 2MASSW~J2224438-015852 using the Brewster retrieval framework.
We find that, within our framework, a model that includes enstatite and quartz cloud layers at shallow
pressures, combined with a deep iron cloud deck fits the data best. This models assumes a Hansen distribution
for particle sizes for each cloud, and Mie scattering. We retrieved particle effective radii of
$\log_{10} a {\rm (\mu m)} = -1.41^{+0.18}_{-0.17}$ for enstatite, $-0.44^{+0.04}_{-0.20}$
for quartz, and $-0.77^{+0.05}_{-0.06}$ for iron. Our inferred cloud column densities suggest
${\rm (Mg/Si)} = 0.69^{+0.06}_{-0.08}$ if there are no other sinks for magnesium or silicon. Models
that include forsterite alongside, or in place of, these cloud species are strongly rejected in
favour of the above combination. We estimate a radius of $0.75 \pm 0.02$ Rjup, which is considerably
smaller than predicted by evolutionary models for a field age object with the luminosity of 2M2224-0158.
Models which assume vertically constant gas fractions are consistently preferred over models
that assume thermochemical equilibrium. From our retrieved gas fractions we infer ${\rm [M/H]}
= +0.38^{+0.07}_{-0.06}$ and ${\rm C/O} = 0.83^{+0.06}_{-0.07}$. Both these values are towards
the upper end of the stellar distribution in the Solar neighbourhood, and are mutually consistent
in this context. A composition toward the extremes of the local distribution is consistent with
this target being an outlier in the ultracool dwarf population.

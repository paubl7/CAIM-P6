Our current understanding of interstellar carbon fractionation hinges on the interpretation
of astrochemical kinetic models. Yet, the various reactions included carry large uncertainties
in their (estimated) rate coefficients, notably those involving C with C$_{2}$. In this work, we
provide theoretical thermal rate coefficients as a function of the temperature for all possible
gas-phase isotope-exchange reactions of C+C$_{2}(X^{1}\Sigma_{g}^{+},a^{3}\Pi_{u})$. For
this, we employ the quasi-classical trajectory method, with the previously obtained potential
energy surfaces of C$_{3}$ dictating the forces between the colliding partners. The calculated
rate coefficients show a positive temperature dependence and are markedly different from previous
theoretical estimates. While the forward reactions are fast and inherently exothermic owing to
the lower zero-point energy content of the products, the reverse processes have temperature thresholds.
For each reaction considered, analytic three-parameter Arrhenius-Kooij formulas are provided
that readily interpolate/extrapolate the associated forward and backward rates. These forms
can further be introduced in astrochemical networks. Apart from the proper kinetic attributes,
we also provide equilibrium constants for these processes, thence confirming their prominence
in the overall C fractionation chemistry. In this respect, the $^{13}$C + $^{12}$C$_{2}(X^{1}{\Sigma}^{+}_{g})$
and $^{13}$C + $^{12}$C$_{2}(a^{3}{\Pi}_{u})$ reactions are found to be particularly conspicuous,
notably at the typical temperatures of dense molecular clouds. For these reactions and considering
both equilibrium and time-dependent chemistry, theoretical $^{12}$C/$^{13}$C ratios as a function
of the gas kinetic temperature are also derived and shown to be consistent with available model chemistry
and observational data on C$_{2}$

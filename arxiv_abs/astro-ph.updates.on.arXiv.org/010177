Context. Periodicities have frequently been reported across many wavelengths in the solar corona.
Correlated periods of ~5 minutes, comparable to solar p-modes, are suggestive of coupling between
the photosphere and the corona. Aims. Our study investigates whether there are correlations in
the periodic behavior of Type III radio bursts, indicative of non-thermal electron acceleration
processes, and coronal EUV emission, assessing heating and cooling, in an active region when there
are no large flares. Methods. We use coordinated observations of Type III radio bursts from the FIELDS
instrument on Parker Solar Probe (PSP), of extreme ultraviolet emissions by the Solar Dynamics
Observatory (SDO)/AIA and white light observations by SDO/HMI, and of solar flare x-rays by Nuclear
Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) on April 12, 2019. Several methods for assessing periodicities
are utilized and compared to validate periods obtained. Results. Periodicities of about 5 minutes
in the EUV in several areas of an active region are well correlated with the repetition rate of the
Type III radio bursts observed on both PSP and Wind. Detrended 211A and 171A light curves show periodic
profiles in multiple locations, with 171A peaks lagging those seen in 211A. This is suggestive of
impulsive events that result in heating and then cooling in the lower corona. NuSTAR x-rays provide
evidence for at least one microflare during the interval of Type III bursts, but there is not a one-to-one
correspondence between the x-rays and the Type-III bursts. Our study provides evidence for periodic
acceleration of non-thermal electrons (required to generate Type III radio bursts) when there
were no observable flares either in the x-ray data or the EUV. The acceleration process, therefore,
must be associated with small impulsive events, perhaps nanoflares.

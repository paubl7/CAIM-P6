Differential flows among different ion species are often observed in the solar wind, and such ion
differential flows can provide the free energy to drive Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron and fast-magnetosonic/whistler
instabilities. Previous works mainly focused on the ion beam instability under the parameters
representative of the solar wind nearby 1 au. In this paper we further study the proton beam instability
using the radial models of the magnetic field and plasma parameters in the inner heliosphere. We
explore a comprehensive distribution of the proton beam instability as functions of the heliocentric
distance and the beam speed. We also perform a detailed analysis of the energy transfer between unstable
waves and particles and quantify how much the free energy of the proton beam flows into unstable waves
and other kinds of particle species (i.e., proton core, alpha particle and electron). This work
clarifies that both parallel and perpendicular electric field are responsible for the excitation
of oblique Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron and oblique fast-magnetosonic/whistler instabilities.
Moreover, this work proposes an effective growth length to estimate whether the instability is
efficiently excited or not. It shows that the oblique Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron instability, oblique
fast-magnetosonic/whistler instability and oblique Alfv\'en/ion-beam instability can be efficiently
driven by proton beams drifting at the speed $\sim 600-1300$ km/s in the solar atmosphere. In particular,
oblique Alfv\'en/ion-cyclotron waves driven in the solar atmosphere can be significantly damped
therein, leading to the solar corona heating. These results are helpful for understanding the proton
beam dynamics in the inner heliosphere and can be verified through in situ satellite measurements.

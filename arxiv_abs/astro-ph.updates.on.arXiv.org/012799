We present a simple regulator-type framework designed specifically for modelling formation of
dwarf galaxies. We explore sensitivity of model predictions for the stellar mass--halo mass and
stellar mass--metallicity relations to different modelling choices and parameter values. Despite
its simplicity, when coupled with realistic mass accretion histories of haloes from simulations
and reasonable choices for model parameter values, the framework can reproduce a remarkably broad
range of observed properties of dwarf galaxies over seven orders of magnitude in stellar mass. In
particular, we show that the model can simultaneously match observational constraints on the stellar
mass-halo mass relation, as well as observed relations between stellar mass and gas phase and stellar
metallicities, gas mass, size, and star formation rate, as well as general form and diversity of
star formation histories (SFHs) of observed dwarf galaxies. The model can thus be used to predict
photometric properties of dwarf galaxies hosted by dark matter haloes in $N$-body simulations,
such as colors, surface brightnesses, and mass-to-light ratios and to forward model observations
of dwarf galaxies. We present examples of such modelling and show that colors and surface brightness
distributions of model galaxies are in good agreement with observed distributions for dwarfs in
recent observational surveys. We also show that in contrast with the common assumption, the absolute
magnitude-halo mass relation is generally predicted to have a non-power law form in the dwarf regime,
and that the fraction of haloes that host detectable ultrafaint galaxies is sensitive to reionization
redshift (zrei) and is predicted to be consistent with observations for zrei<~9.

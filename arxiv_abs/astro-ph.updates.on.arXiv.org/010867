We present results from a new cosmological hydrodynamics simulation campaign of protocluster
(PC) regions, FOREVER22: FORmation and EVolution of galaxies in Extremely-overdense Regions
motivated by SSA22. The simulations cover a wide range of cosmological scales using three different
zoom set-ups in a parent volume of $(714.2~\rm Mpc)^{3}$: PCR (Proto-Cluster Region; $V= (28.6~{\rm
Mpc})^{3} $ and SPH particle mass, $m_{\rm{SPH}} = 4.1 \times 10^{6}~\rm M_{\odot})$, BCG (Brightest
proto-Cluster Galaxy; $V \sim (3~{\rm Mpc})^{3} $ and $m_{\rm SPH} = 5.0\times10^{5}~\rm M_{\odot}$
), and First ( $V \sim (0.4~{\rm Mpc})^{3} $ and $m_{\rm SPH} = 7.9 \times 10^{3}~\rm M_{\odot}$)
runs, that allow to focus on different aspects of galaxy formation. In the PCR runs, we follow 10 PCs,
each harbouring 1 - 4 SMBHs with $M_{\rm BH} \ge 10^{9}~\rm M_{\odot}$. One of the PC cores shows a
spatially close arrangement of seven starburst galaxies with ${\rm SFR} \gtrsim 100~\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$
each, that are dust-obscured and would appear as submillimeter galaxies with flux $\gtrsim 1~$
mJy at $1.1~ \rm mm$ in observations. The BCG runs show that the total SFRs of haloes hosting BCGs are
affected by AGN feedback, but exceed $1000~\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ at $z \lesssim 6$. The First
runs resolve mini-haloes hosting population (Pop) III stars and we show that, in PC regions, the
dominant stellar population changes from Pop III to Pop II at $z \gtrsim 20$, and the first galaxies
with ${\rm SFR} \gtrsim 18~\rm M_{\odot}~yr^{-1}$ form at $z \sim 10$. These can be prime targets
for future observations with the James Webb Space Telescope. Our simulations successfully reproduce
the global star formation activities in observed PCs and suggest that PCs can kickstart cosmic reionization.

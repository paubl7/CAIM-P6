Observations have confirmed the existence of multiple-planet systems containing a hot Jupiter
and smaller planetary companions. Examples include WASP-47, Kepler-730, and TOI-1130. We examine
the plausibility of forming such systems in situ using $N$-body simulations that include a realistic
treatment of collisions, an evolving protoplanetary disc and eccentricity/inclination damping
of planetary embryos. Initial conditions are constructed using two different models for the core
of the giant planet: a 'seed-model' and an 'equal-mass-model'. The former has a more massive protoplanet
placed among multiple small embryos in a compact configuration. The latter consists only of equal-mass
embryos. Simulations of the seed-model lead to the formation of systems containing a hot Jupiter
and super-Earths. The evolution consistently follows four distinct phases: early giant impacts;
runaway gas accretion onto the seed protoplanet; disc damping-dominated evolution of the embryos
orbiting exterior to the giant; a late chaotic phase after dispersal of the gas disc. Approximately
1% of the equal-mass simulations form a giant and follow the same four-phase evolution. Synthetic
transit observations of the equal-mass simulations provide an occurrence rate of 0.26% for systems
containing a hot Jupiter and an inner super-Earth, similar to the 0.2% occurrence rate from actual
transit surveys, but simulated hot Jupiters are rarely detected as single transiting planets,
in disagreement with observations. A subset of our simulations form two close-in giants, similar
to the WASP-148 system. The scenario explored here provides a viable pathway for forming systems
with unusual architectures, but does not apply to the majority of hot Jupiters.

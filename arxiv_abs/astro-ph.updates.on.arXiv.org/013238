Massive stars play critical roles for the reionization of the Universe. Individual massive stars
at the reionization epoch (z > 6) are too faint to observe and quantify their contributions to reionization.
Some massive stars, however, explode as superluminous supernovae (SLSNe) or pair-instability
supernovae (PISNe) that are luminous enough to observe even at z > 6 and allow for the direct characterization
of massive star properties at the reionization epoch. In addition, hypothetical long-sought-after
PISNe are expected to be present preferentially at high redshifts, and their discovery will have
a tremendous impact on our understanding of massive star evolution and the formation of stellar
mass black holes. The near-infrared Wide Field Instrument on Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope
will excel at discovering such rare high-redshift supernovae. In this work, we investigate the
best survey strategy to discover and identify SLSNe and PISNe at z > 6 with Roman. We show that the combination
of the F158 and F213 filters can clearly separate both SLSNe and PISNe at z > 6 from nearby supernovae
through their colors and magnitudes. The limiting magnitudes are required to be 27.0 mag and 26.5
mag in the F158 and F213 filters, respectively, to identify supernovae at z > 6. If we conduct a 10 deg2
transient survey with these limiting magnitudes for 5 years with a cadence of one year, we expect
to discover 22.5 +- 2.8 PISNe and 3.1 +- 0.3 SLSNe at z > 6, depending on the cosmic star-formation history.
The same survey is estimated to discover 76.1 +- 8.2 PISNe and 9.1 +- 0.9 SLSNe at 5 < z < 6. Such a supernova
survey requires the total observational time of approximately 525 hours in 5 years. The legacy data
acquired with the survey will also be beneficial for many different science cases including the
study of high-redshift galaxies.

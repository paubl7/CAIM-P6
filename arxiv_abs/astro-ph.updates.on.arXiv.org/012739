The identification of PeVatrons, hadronic particle accelerators reaching the knee of the cosmic
ray spectrum (few $10^{15}$ eV), is crucial to understand the origin of cosmic rays in the Galaxy.
We provide an update on the unidentified source HESS J1702-420, a promising PeVatron candidate.
We present new observations of HESS J1702-420 made with the High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.),
and processed using improved analysis techniques. The analysis configuration was optimized to
enhance the collection area at the highest energies. We applied a three-dimensional (3D) likelihood
analysis to model the source region and adjust non thermal radiative spectral models to the $\gamma$-ray
data. We also analyzed archival data from the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) to constrain the source
spectrum at $\gamma$-ray energies >10 GeV. We report the detection of a new source component called
HESS J1702-420A, that was separated from the bulk of TeV emission at a $5.4\sigma$ confidence level.
The power law $\gamma$-ray spectrum of HESS J1702-420A extends with an index of $\Gamma=1.53\pm0.19_\text{stat}\pm0.20_\text{sys}$
and without curvature up to the energy band 64-113 TeV, in which it was detected by H.E.S.S. at a $4.0\sigma$
confidence level. This brings evidence for the source emission up to $100\,\text{TeV}$, which
makes HESS J1702-420A a compelling candidate site for the presence of extremely high energy cosmic
rays. Remarkably, in a hadronic scenario, the cut-off energy of the proton distribution powering
HESS J1702-420A is found to be higher than 0.5 PeV at a 95% confidence level. HESS J1702-420A becomes
therefore one of the most solid PeVatron candidates detected so far in H.E.S.S. data, altough a leptonic
origin of its emission could not be ruled out either.

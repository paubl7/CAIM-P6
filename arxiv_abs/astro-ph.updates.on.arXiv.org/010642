Eclipsing binary stars allow derivation of accurate and precise masses and radii. When they reside
in star clusters, properties of even higher precision, along with additional information, can
be extracted. Asteroseismology of solar-like oscillations offers similar possibilities for
single stars. We improve the previously established properties of the Hyades eclipsing binary
HD27130 and re-assess the asteroseismic properties of the giant star $\epsilon$ Tau. The physical
properties of these members of the Hyades are then used to constrain the helium content and age of
the cluster. New multi-colour light curves were combined with multi-epoch radial velocities to
yield masses and radii of HD27130. $T_{\rm eff}$ was derived from spectroscopy and photometry,
and verified using the Gaia parallax. We estimate the cluster age from re-evaluated asteroseismic
properties of $\epsilon$ Tau while using HD27130 to constrain the helium content. The masses and
radii, and $T_{\rm eff}$ of HD 27130 were found to be $M=1.0245\pm0.0024 M_{\odot}$, $R=0.9226\pm0.015
R_{\odot}$, $T_{\rm eff}=5650\pm50$ K for the primary, and $M=0.7426\pm0.0016 M_{\odot}$, $R=0.7388\pm0.026
R_{\odot}$, $T_{\rm eff}=4300\pm100$ K for the secondary component. Our re-evaluation of $\epsilon$
Tau suggests that the previous literature estimates are trustworthy, and that the Hipparcos parallax
is more reliable than the Gaia DR2 parallax. The helium content of HD27130 and thus of the Hyades is
found to be $Y=0.27$ but with significant model dependence. Correlations with the adopted metallicity
results in a robust helium enrichment law with $\frac{\Delta Y}{\Delta Z}$ close to 1.2. We estimate
the age of the Hyades to be 0.9 $\pm$ 0.1 (stat) $\pm$ 0.1 (sys) Gyr in slight tension with recent age
estimates based on the cluster white dwarfs. (abridged)

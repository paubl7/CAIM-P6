Modern galaxy formation theory suggests that the misalignment between stellar and gaseous components
usually results from an external gas accretion and/or interaction with other galaxies. The extreme
case of the kinematic misalignment is demonstrated by so-called galaxies with counterrotation
that possess two distinct components rotating in opposite directions with respect to each other.
We provide an in-deep analysis of galaxies with counterrotation from IllustrisTNG100 cosmological
simulations. We have found $25$ galaxies with substantial stellar counterrotation in the stellar
mass range of $2\times10^{9}-3\times10^{10}$~\Msun. In our sample the stellar counterrotation
is a result of an external gas infall happened $\approx 2-8$~Gyr ago. The infall leads to the initial
removal of pre-existing gas, which is captured and mixed together with the infalling component.
The gas mixture ends up in the counterrotating gaseous disc. We show that $\approx 90\%$ of the stellar
counterrotation formed in-situ, in the counterrotating gas. During the early phases of the infall,
gas can be found in inclined extended and rather thin disc-like structures, and in some galaxies
they are similar to (nearly-)~polar disc or ring-like structures. We discuss a possible link between
the gas infall, AGN activity and the formation of misaligned components. In particular, we suggest
that the AGN activity does not cause the counterrotation, although it is efficiently triggered
by the retrograde gas infall, and it correlates well with the misaligned component appearance.
We also find evidence of the stellar disc heating visible as an increase of the vertical-to-radial
velocity dispersion ratio above unity in both co- and counterrotating components, which implies
the importance of the kinematical misalignment in shaping the velocity ellipsoids in disc galaxies.

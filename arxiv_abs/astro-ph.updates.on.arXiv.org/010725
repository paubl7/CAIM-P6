The observer peculiar motion produces boosting effects in the background anisotropies with frequency
spectral behaviours related to its spectrum. We study how the frequency spectrum of the background
isotropic monopole emission is modified and transferred to the frequency spectra at higher multipoles,
l. We perform the analysis in terms of spherical harmonic expansion up to a certain lmax, for various
models from radio to far-IR. We derive a system of linear equations to obtain spherical harmonic
coefficients and provide explicit solutions up to lmax=6 as linear combinations of the signals
at N=lmax+1 colatitudes. The associated Legendre polynomials symmetry with respect to {\pi}/2
is used to separate the system into two subsystems, one for l=0 and even l, the other for odd l. This
improves the solutions accuracy with respect to an arbitrary colatitudes choice. We apply the method
to analytical or semi-analytical representions of monopole spectra, i.e. to four types of CMB distortions,
four types of extragalactic backgrounds superimposed to the CMB Planckian spectrum and some combinations
of them. We present our results in terms of spherical harmonic coefficients, relationships between
the observed and intrinsic monopoles, maps, angular power spectra. We compare the method results
with the ones obtained using more computationally demanding numerical integrations or map generation/inversion.
The method is generalized to include the effect of the observer motion relative to the Sun. Its simplicity
and efficiency can significantly alleviate the computational effort needed for accurate predictions
and for the analysis of future data. We discuss the superposition of the CMB intrinsic anisotropies
and of the effects induced by the observer motion, exploring for the possibility of constraining
the intrinsic dipole embedded in the kinematic dipole, in the presence of CMB spectral distortions.

We perform a comprehensive determination of the systemic proper motions of 74 dwarf galaxies and
dwarf galaxy candidates in the Local Group based on Gaia early data release 3. The outputs of the analysis
for each galaxy, including probabilities of membership, will be made publicly available. The analysis
is augmented by a determination of the orbital properties of galaxies within 500 kpc. We adopt the
flexible Bayesian methodology presented by McConnachie \& Venn (2020), which takes into account
the location of the stars on the sky, on the colour-magnitude diagram and on the proper motion plane.
We apply some modifications, in particular to the way the colour-magnitude diagram and spectroscopic
information are factored in, e.g. by including stars in several evolution phases. The bulk motions
are integrated in three gravitational potentials: two where the Milky Way is treated in isolation
and has a mass 0.9 \& 1.6 $\times 10^{12}$M$_{\odot}$ and the time-varying potential by Vasiliev
et al. (2021), which includes the infall of a massive Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). We are able to
determine bulk proper motions for 73 systems, and we consider reliable 66 of these measurements.
For the first time, systemic motions are presented for galaxies out to a distance of 1.4 Mpc, in the
NGC~3109 association. The inclusion of the infall of a massive LMC significantly modifies the orbital
trajectories of the objects, with respect to orbit integration in static Milky Way-only potentials,
and leads to 6 galaxies being likely associated to the LMC, 3 possibly associated and 1 recently captured
object. We discuss the results of the orbit integration in the context of the relation of the galaxies
to the system of Milky Way satellites, implications for the too-big-to-fail problem, impact on
star formation histories, and tidal disruption.

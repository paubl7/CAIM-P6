We present multi-tracer dynamical models of the low mass ($M_{*} \sim 10^{7}$), isolated dwarf
irregular galaxy WLM in order to simultaneously constrain the inner slope of the dark matter (DM)
halo density profile ($\gamma$) and flattening ($q_\mathrm{DM}$), and the stellar orbital anisotropy
($\beta_{z}, \beta_{r}$). For the first time, we show how jointly constraining the mass distribution
from the HI gas rotation curve and solving the Jeans' equations with discrete stellar kinematics
leads to a factor of $\sim2$ reduction in the uncertainties on $\gamma$. The mass-anisotropy degeneracy
is also partially broken, leading to reductions on uncertainty by $\sim 30\%$ on $M_\mathrm{vir}$
(and $\sim 70\%$ at the half-light radius) and $\sim 25\%$ on anisotropy. Our inferred value of $\gamma
= 0.3 \pm 0.1$ is robust to the halo geometry, and in excellent agreement with predictions of stellar
feedback driven DM core creation. The derived prolate geometry of the DM halo with $q_\mathrm{DM}
= 2 \pm 1$ is consistent with $\Lambda$CDM simulations of dwarf galaxy halos. While self-interacting
DM (SIDM) models with $\sigma/m_{X} \sim 0.6$ can reproduce this cored DM profile, the interaction
events may sphericalise the halo. The simultaneously cored and prolate DM halo may therefore present
a challenge for SIDM. Finally we find that the radial profile of stellar anisotropy in WLM ($\beta_{r}$)
follows a nearly identical trend of increasing tangential anisotropy to the classical dSphs, Fornax
and Sculptor. Given WLM's orbital history, this result may call into question whether such anisotropy
is a consequence of tidal stripping in only one pericentric passage or if it instead is a feature of
the largely self-similar formation and evolutionary pathways for some dwarf galaxies.

A starshade suppresses starlight by a factor of 1E11 in the image plane of a telescope, which is crucial
for directly imaging Earth-like exoplanets. The state of the art in high contrast post-processing
and signal detection methods were developed specifically for images taken with an internal coronagraph
system and focus on the removal of quasi-static speckles. These methods are less useful for starshade
images where such speckles are not present. This paper is dedicated to investigating signal processing
methods tailored to work efficiently on starshade images. We describe a signal detection method,
the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT), for starshade missions and look into three important
problems. First, even with the light suppression provided by the starshade, rocky exoplanets are
still difficult to detect in reflected light due to their absolute faintness. GLRT can successfully
flag these dim planets. Moreover, GLRT provides estimates of the planets' positions and intensities
and the theoretical false alarm rate of the detection. Second, small starshade shape errors, such
as a truncated petal tip, can cause artifacts that are hard to distinguish from real planet signals;
the detection method can help distinguish planet signals from such artifacts. The third direct
imaging problem is that exozodiacal dust degrades detection performance. We develop an iterative
generalized likelihood ratio test to mitigate the effect of dust on the image. In addition, we provide
guidance on how to choose the number of photon counting images to combine into one co-added image
before doing detection, which will help utilize the observation time efficiently. All the methods
are demonstrated on realistic simulated images.

The H$\alpha$ equivalent width (EW) is an observational proxy for specific star formation rate
(sSFR) and a tracer of episodic star-formation activity. Previous assessments show that EW strongly
anti-correlates with stellar mass as $M^{-0.25}$ similar to the sSFR -- stellar mass relation.
However, such a correlation may be driven/formed by selection effects. In this study, we investigate
how H$\alpha$ EWs correlate with galaxy properties and how selection biases could alter such correlations
using a $z = 0.47$ narrowband-selected sample of 1572 H$\alpha$ emitters from the Ly$\alpha$ Galaxies
in the Epoch of Reionization (LAGER) survey. The sample covers 3 deg$^2$ of COSMOS and $1.1\times10^5$
cMpc$^3$. We assume an intrinsic EW distribution to form mock samples of H$\alpha$ emitters (HAEs)
and propagate the selection criteria to match observations, giving us control on how selection
biases can affect the underlying results. We find EW intrinsically correlates with stellar mass
as $W_0 \propto M^{-0.16\pm0.03}$ and decreases by a factor of $\sim 3$ from $10^{7}$ to $10^{10}$
M$_\odot$. We find low-mass HAEs to be $\sim 320$ times more likely to have rest-frame EW$ > 200$\AA
compared to high-mass HAEs. Combining the intrinsic EW -- stellar mass correlation with an observed
SMF correctly reproduces the observed H$\alpha$ LF, while not correcting for selection effects
underestimates the number of bright HAEs. This suggests that the intrinsic EW -- stellar mass correlation
is physically significant and reproduces three statistical distributions of galaxy populations
(LF, SMF, EW distribution). At lower masses, we find there are more high-EW outliers compared to
high masses, even after taking into account selection effects. Our results suggest that high sSFR
outliers indicative of bursty SF activity are intrinsically more prevalent in low-mass HAEs and
not a byproduct of selection effects.

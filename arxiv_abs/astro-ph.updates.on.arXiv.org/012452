The observations of high redshifts quasars at $z\gtrsim 6$ have revealed that supermassive black
holes (SMBHs) of mass $\sim 10^9\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ were already in place within the first $\sim$
Gyr after the Big Bang. Supermassive stars (SMSs) with masses $10^{3-5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
are potential seeds for these observed SMBHs. A possible formation channel of these SMSs is the interplay
of gas accretion and runaway stellar collisions inside dense nuclear star clusters (NSCs). However,
mass loss due to stellar winds could be an important limitation for the formation of the SMSs and affect
the final mass. In this paper, we study the effect of mass loss driven by stellar winds on the formation
and evolution of SMSs in dense NSCs using idealised N-body simulations. Considering different
accretion scenarios, we have studied the effect of the mass loss rates over a wide range of metallicities
$Z_\ast=[.001-1]\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$ and Eddington factors $f_{\rm Edd}=L_\ast/L_{\mathrm{Edd}}=0.5,0.7,\,\&\,
0.9$. For a high accretion rate of $10^{-4}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$, SMSs with masses $\gtrsim
10^3\MSun$ could be formed even in a high metallicity environment. For a lower accretion rate of
$10^{-5}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}yr^{-1}}$, SMSs of masses $\sim 10^{3-4}\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
can be formed for all adopted values of $Z_\ast$ and $f_{\rm Edd}$, except for $Z_\ast=\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$
and $f_{\rm Edd}=0.7$ or 0.9. For Eddington accretion, SMSs of masses $\sim 10^3\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$
can be formed in low metallicity environments with $Z_\ast\lesssim 0.01\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$.
The most massive SMSs of masses $\sim 10^5\,\mathrm{M_{\odot}}$ can be formed for Bondi-Hoyle
accretion in environments with $Z_\ast \lesssim 0.5\mathrm{Z_{\odot}}$.

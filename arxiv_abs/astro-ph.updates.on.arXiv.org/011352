Context. It is well known that solar flares have broad impacts on the low atmosphere, but it is largely
unknown how they affect sunspot waves and oscillations. It is also under debate as to whether the
flare-induced photospheric changes are due to the momentum conservation with coronal mass ejections
or due to magnetic reconnection. Aims. To shed light on the so-called "back reaction" of solar eruptions,
we investigated how running penumbral waves (RPWs) at one foot of an erupting magnetic flux rope
(MFR) responds to the rope buildup and subsequent erosion. Results. During the rope-buildup stage,
the western foot of the rope, which is completely enclosed by a hooked ribbon, expands rapidly and
consequently overlaps a sunspot penumbra. This converts the original penumbral field into the
rope field, which is associated with a transient increase in electric currents flowing through
the ribbon-swept penumbral region. During the rope-erosion stage, the rope foot shrinks as the
eastern section of the hooked ribbon slowly sweeps the same penumbral region, where the rope field
is converted into flare loops. This conversion induces mixed effects on the photospheric field
inclination but heats up the low atmosphere at the footpoints of these flare loops to transition-region
temperatures, therefore resulting in the post-eruption RPWs with an enhanced contrast in the 1600A
passband and an extended bandwidth to low frequencies at 3-5 mHz, compared with the pre-eruption
RPWs that peak at 6 mHz. Conclusions. This observation clearly demonstrates that it is the magnetic
reconnection in the corona that impacts the low atmosphere and leads to the changing behaviors of
RPWs, which, in turn, offer a new window to diagnose flare reconnections.

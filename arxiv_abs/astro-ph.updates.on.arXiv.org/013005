In this work, we first discuss the possibility that dark energy models with negative energy density
values in the past can alleviate the $H_0$ tension, as well as the discrepancy with the baryon acoustic
oscillation (BAO) Lyman-$\alpha$ data, both which prevail within the $\Lambda$CDM model. We then
investigate whether two minimal extensions of the $\Lambda$CDM model, together or separately,
can successfully realize such a scenario: (i) the spatial curvature, which, in the case of spatially
closed universe, mimics a negative density source and (ii) simple-graduated dark energy (gDE),
which promotes the null inertial mass density of the usual vacuum energy to an arbitrary constant--if
negative, the corresponding energy density decreases with redshift similar to the phantom models,
but unlike them crosses below zero at a certain redshift. We find that, when the Planck data are not
included in the observational analysis, the models with simple-gDE predict interesting and some
significant deviations from the $\Lambda$CDM model. In particular, a spatially closed universe
along with a simple-gDE of positive inertial mass density, which work in contrast to each other,
results in minor improvement to the $H_0$ tension. The joint dataset, including the Planck data,
presents no evidence for a deviation from spatial flatness but almost the same evidence for a cosmological
constant and the simple-gDE with an inertial mass density of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-12})\,\rm
eV^4$. The latter case predicts almost no deviation from the $\Lambda$CDM model up until today--so
that it results in no improvement regarding the BAO Ly-$\alpha$ data--except that it slightly aggravates
the $H_0$ tension. We also study via dynamical analysis the history of the Universe in the models,
as the simple-gDE results in futures different than the de Sitter future of the $\Lambda$CDM model.

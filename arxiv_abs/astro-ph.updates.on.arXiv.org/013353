We present the clustering analysis of photometric luminous red galaxies (LRGs) at a redshift range
of $0.1\leq z \leq 1.05$ using $615,317$ photometric LRGs selected from the Hyper Suprime-Cam Subaru
Strategic Program covering $\sim124$ deg$^{2}$. Our sample covers a broad range of stellar masses
and photometric redshifts and enables a halo occupation distribution analysis to study the redshift
and stellar-mass dependence of dark halo properties of LRGs. We find a tight correlation between
the characteristic dark halo mass to host central LRGs, $M_{\min}$, and the number density of LRGs
independently of redshifts, indicating that the formation of LRGs is associated with the global
environment. The $M_{\min}$ of LRGs depends only weakly on the stellar mass $M_{\star}$ at $M_{\star}
\lesssim 10^{10.75}h^{-2} M_{\odot}$ at $0.3<z<1.05$, in contrast to the case for all photometrically
selected galaxies for which $M_{\min}$ shows significant dependence on $M_{\star}$ even at low
$M_{\star}$. The weak stellar mass dependence is indicative of the dark halo mass being the key parameter
for the formation of LRGs rather than the stellar mass. Our result suggests that the halo mass of $\sim
10^{12.5 \pm 0.2}h^{-1} M_{\odot}$ is the critical mass for an efficient halo quenching due to the
halo environment. We compare our result with the result of the hydrodynamical simulation to find
that low-mass LRGs at $z \sim 1$ will increase their stellar masses by an order magnitude from $z=1$
to $0$ through mergers and satellite accretions, and a large fraction of massive LRGs at $z<0.9$
consist of LRGs that are recently migrated from massive green valley galaxies or those evolved from
less massive LRGs through mergers and satellite accretions.

The Visible-Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIR) on board the Dawn spacecraft revealed that aqueous
secondary minerals -- Mg-phyllosilicates, NH4-bearing phases, and Mg/Ca carbonates -- are ubiquitous
on Ceres. Ceres' low reflectance requires dark phases, which were assumed to be amorphous carbon
and/or magnetite (~80 wt.%). In contrast, the Gamma Ray and Neutron Detector (GRaND) constrained
the abundances of C (8-14 wt.%) and Fe (15-17 wt.%). Here, we reconcile the VIR-derived mineral composition
with the GRaND-derived elemental composition. First, we model mineral abundances from VIR data,
including either meteorite-derived insoluble organic matter, amorphous carbon, magnetite,
or combination as the darkening agent and provide statistically rigorous error bars from a Bayesian
algorithm combined with a radiative-transfer model. Elemental abundances of C and Fe are much higher
than is suggested by the GRaND observations for all models satisfying VIR data. We then show that
radiative transfer modeling predicts higher reflectance from a carbonaceous chondrite of known
composition than its measured reflectance. Consequently, our second models use multiple carbonaceous
chondrite endmembers, allowing for the possibility that their specific textures or minerals other
than carbon or magnetite act as darkening agents, including sulfides and tochilinite. Unmixing
models with carbonaceous chondrites eliminate the discrepancy in elemental abundances of C and
Fe. Ceres' average reflectance spectrum and elemental abundances are best reproduced by carbonaceous-chondrite-like
materials (40-70 wt.%), IOM or amorphous carbon (10 wt.%), magnetite (3-8 wt.%), serpentine (10-25
wt.%), carbonates (4-12 wt.%), and NH4-bearing phyllosilicates (1-11 wt.%).

We conduct a thorough Bayesian analysis of the possibility that the black hole merger events seen
in gravitational waves are primordial black hole (PBH) mergers. Using the latest merger rate models
for PBH binaries drawn from a lognormal mass function we compute posterior parameter constraints
and Bayesian evidences using data from the first two observing runs of LIGO-Virgo. We account for
theoretical uncertainty due to possible disruption of the binary by surrounding PBHs, which can
suppress the merger rate significantly. We also consider simple astrophysically motivated models
and find that these are favoured decisively over the PBH scenario, quantified by the Bayesian evidence
ratio. Paying careful attention to the influence of the parameter priors and the quality of the model
fits, we show that the evidence ratios can be understood by comparing the predicted chirp mass distribution
to that of the data. We identify the posterior predictive distribution of chirp mass as a vital tool
for discriminating between models. A model in which all mergers are PBH binaries is strongly disfavoured
compared with astrophysical models, in part due to the over-prediction of heavy systems having
$\mathcal{M}_{{\rm chirp}} \gtrsim 40 \, M_\odot$ and positive skewness over the range of observed
masses which does not match the observations. We find that the fit is not significantly improved
by adding a maximum mass cut-off, a bimodal mass function, or imposing that PBH binaries form at late
times. We argue that a successful PBH model must either modify the lognormal shape of the initial
mass function significantly or abandon the hypothesis that all observed merging binaries are primordial.
We develop and apply techniques for analysing PBH models with gravitational wave data which will
be necessary for robust statistical inference as the gravitational wave source sample size increases.

The high redshift Lyman-alpha forest, in particular the Gunn-Peterson trough, is the most unambiguous
signature of the neutral to ionized transition of the intergalactic medium (IGM) taking place during
the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Recent studies, e.g. Kulkarni et al. (2019a) and Keating et al.
(2019), showed that reproducing the observed Lyman-alpha opacities after overlap required a non-monotonous
evolution of cosmic emissivity: rising, peaking at z=6, and then decreasing onwards to z=4. Such
an evolution is puzzling considering galaxy build-up and the cosmic star formation rate are still
continously on the rise at these epochs. Here, we use new RAMSES-CUDATON simulations to show that
such a peaked evolution may occur naturally in a fully coupled radiation-hydrodynamical framework,
due to radiative suppression of star formation. In our best matching run, cosmic emissivity at z>6
is dominated by a low mass (M$_{\rm DM}<2.10^9$ M$_{\odot}$), high escape fraction halo population,
driving reionization, up to overlap. Approaching z=6, this population is radiatively suppressed
due to the rising ionizing UV background, and its emissivity drops.In the meantime, the high mass,
low escape fraction, halo population builds up and its emissivity rises, but not fast enough to compensate
the dimming of the low mass haloes. The combined ionizing emissivity of these two populations therefore
naturallyresults in a rise and fall of the cosmic emissivity, from z=12 to z=4, with a peak at z=6.
An alternative simulation, which features a later suppression and higher escape fractions for
the high mass haloes, leads to overshooting the ionizing rate, over-ionizing the IGM and therefore
too low Lyman-alpha opacities.

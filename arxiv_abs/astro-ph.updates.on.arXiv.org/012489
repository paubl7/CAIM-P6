We present the first characterization of the diffuse gas and metals in the circumgalactic medium
of 96 z = 2.9-3.8 Ly$\alpha$ emitters (LAEs) detected with the Multi-Unit Spectroscopic Explorer
(MUSE) in fields centered on 8 bright background quasars as part of our MUSEQuBES survey. The LAEs
have relatively low Ly$\alpha$ luminosities (~$10^{42}$ erg/s) and star formation rates ~1 $M_\odot$/yr,
which for main sequence galaxies corresponds to stellar masses of only ~$10^{8.6}$ $M_{\odot}$.
The median transverse distance between the LAEs and the quasar sightlines is 165 proper kpc (pkpc).
We stacked the high-resolution quasar spectra and measured significant excess HI and CIV absorption
near the LAEs out to 500 km/s and at least 250 pkpc (corresponding to ~7 virial radii). At < 30 km/s from
the galaxies the median HI and CIV optical depths are enhanced by an order of magnitude. The average
rest-frame equivalent width of Ly$\alpha$ absorption is comparable to that for Lyman-break galaxies
(LBGs) at z~2.3 and ~L* galaxies at z~0.2, but considerably higher than for sub-L*/dwarf galaxies
at low redshift. The CIV equivalent width is comparable to those measured for low-z dwarf galaxies
and z~2.3 LBGs but significantly lower than for z~2.3 quasar-host galaxies. The absorption is significantly
stronger around the ~ 1/3 of our LAEs that are part of "groups", which we attribute to the large-scale
structures in which they are embedded. We do not detect any strong dependence of either the HI or CIV
absorption on transverse distance (over the range 50-250 pkpc), redshift, or the properties of
the Ly$\alpha$ emission line (luminosity, full width at half maximum, or equivalent width). However,
for HI, but not CIV, the absorption at < 100 km/s from the LAE does increase with the star formation
rate. This suggests that LAEs surrounded by more neutral gas tend to have higher star formation rates.

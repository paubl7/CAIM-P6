During the evolution of protoplanetary disks into planetary systems we expect to detect signatures
that trace mechanisms such as planet-disk interaction. Protoplanetary disks display a large variety
of structures in recently published high-spatial resolution images. However, the three-dimensional
morphology of these disks is often difficult to infer from the two-dimensional projected images
we observe. We spatially resolve the disk around HD 34282 using VLT/SPHERE in polarimetric imaging
mode. We retrieve a profile for the height of the scattering surface to create a height-corrected
deprojection, which simulates a face-on orientation. The disk displays a complex scattering surface.
An inner clearing or cavity extending up to r<0.28" (88 au) is surrounded by a bright inclined (i =
56 deg) ring with a position angle of 119 deg. The center of this ring is offset from the star along the
minor axis with 0.07", which can be explained with a disk-height of 26 au above the mid-plane. Outside
this ring, beyond its south-eastern ansa we detect an azimuthal asymmetry or blob at r ~ 0.4". At larger
separation, we detect an outer disk structure that can be fitted with an ellipse, compatible with
a circular ring seen at r = 0.62" (190 au) and height of 77 au. After applying a height-corrected deprojection
we see a circular ring centered on the star at 88 au, while what seemed to be a separate blob and outer
ring, now both could be part of a single-armed spiral. Based on the current data it is not possible
to conclude decisively whether $H_{\rm scat} / r$ remains constant or whether the surface is flared
with at most $H_{\rm scat} \propto r^{1.35}$ , although we favor the constant ratio based on our deprojections.
The height-corrected deprojection allows a more detailed interpretation of the observed structures,
after which we discern the detection of a single-armed spiral.

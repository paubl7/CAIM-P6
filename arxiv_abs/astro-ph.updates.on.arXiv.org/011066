In the last years, the Observatory of Padova (Istituto Nazionale di Astrofisica - Osservatorio
Astronomico di Padova) and the University of Padova have been involved massively in projects dedicated
to the exoplanets search, both ground, and space-based. The activities concerning my Ph.D. have
been exploited both in the framework of the space projects and in the field of ground instrumentation.
PLATO, the acronym of "PLAnetary Transits and Oscillations of stars", is a ESA mission o with the
target to detect and characterize exoplanets utilizing their transit on a bright star. The overall
instrumental layout consists of a multi-telescope concept instrument, composed by several tens
of telescope units, for which it has developed an all-refractive optical solution. These devices
are characterized by a very large Field of View (>20 degrees on one side) with an optical quality that
fits most of the energy into a single sensor pixel. I participated in the Assembly, Integration,
and Verification (AIV) of the Telescope Optical Unit prototype, to validate the AIV procedure and
the telescope optical performance in-flight conditions. SHARK-NIR, the acronym of "System for
coronagraphy with High order Adaptive optics from R to K band - Near-Infrared", is an instrument
designed to search and characterize the young exo-planetary system and star-forming regions in
the NIR domain, in coronagraphic direct imaging and spectroscopic mode. It has been selected for
the 2nd generation Large Binocular Telescope (LBT) instruments, and it will take advantage of the
excellent performance of the LBT eXtreme Adaptive Optics (XAO) correction, necessary for SHARK-NIR
to achieve the best possible coronagraphic performance, which is mandatory to detect faint planets
orbiting around bright stars. Concerning SHARK, my activity has been performing optical alignment
and qualification of the instrument.

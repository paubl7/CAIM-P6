The question of whether Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature and polarization data from
Planck favor a spatially closed Universe with curvature parameter $\Omega_K<0$ has been the subject
of recent intense discussions. Attempts to break the geometrical degeneracy combining Planck
data with external datasets such as Baryon Acoustic Oscillation (BAO) measurements all point towards
a spatially flat Universe, at the cost of significant tensions with Planck, which make the resulting
dataset combination problematic. Settling this issue would require identifying a dataset which
can break the geometrical degeneracy while not incurring in these tensions. In this work we argue
that cosmic chronometers (CC), measurements of the expansion rate $H(z)$ from the relative ages
of massive early-type passively evolving galaxies, are the dataset we are after. Furthermore,
CC come with the additional advantage of being virtually free of cosmological model assumptions.
Combining Planck 2018 CMB temperature and polarization data with the latest compilation of CC measurements,
we break the geometrical degeneracy and find $\Omega_K=-0.0054 \pm 0.0055$, consistent with a
spatially flat Universe and competitive with the Planck+BAO constraint. After discussing our
results in light of the oldest objects in the Universe, we assess their stability against against
minimal parameter space extensions and CC systematics, finding them to be stable against both.
We find no substantial tension between Planck and CC data within a non-flat Universe, making the
resulting combination reliable. Our results therefore allow us to assert with confidence that
the Universe is indeed spatially flat to the ${\cal O}(10^{-2})$ level, a finding which might possibly
settle the ongoing spatial curvature debate, and lends even more support to the already very successful
inflationary paradigm.

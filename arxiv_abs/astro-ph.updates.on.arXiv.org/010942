We present a wavelet-based algorithm to identify dwarf galaxies in the Milky Way in ${\it Gaia}$
DR2 data. Our algorithm detects overdensities in 4D position-proper motion space, making it the
first search to explicitly use velocity information to search for dwarf galaxy candidates. We optimize
our algorithm and quantify its performance by searching for mock dwarfs injected into ${\it Gaia}$
DR2 data and for known Milky Way satellite galaxies. Comparing our results with previous photometric
searches, we find that our search is sensitive to undiscovered systems at Galactic latitudes $\lvert
b\rvert>10^{\circ}$ and with half-light radii larger than the 50% detection efficiency threshold
for Pan-STARRS1 (PS1) at (${\it i}$) absolute magnitudes of $-6.5<M_V<-3$ and distances of $32$
kpc $< D < 64$ kpc, and (${\it ii}$) $M_V< -4$ and $64$ kpc $< D < 128$ kpc. Based on these results, we predict
that our search is expected to discover $6 \pm 2$ new satellite galaxies; four in the PS1 footprint
and two outside the Dark Energy Survey and PS1 footprints. We apply our algorithm to the ${\it Gaia}$
DR2 dataset and recover $\sim 1000$ high-significance candidates, out of which we identify a "gold
standard" list of $\sim 120$ candidates based on color-magnitude diagram inspection. Of these
120 candidates, nine contain ${\it Gaia}$-identified RR Lyrae, four of which are likely associated
with the Sagittarius Stream, one of which is likely associated with the PS1-D stream, and four of
which are near known systems but do not show conclusive associations. All of our candidate lists
are publicly distributed for future follow-up studies. We show that improvements in parallax and
proper motion measurements provided by ${\it Gaia}$ EDR3 and DR3 data will increase the sensitivity
of this technique, and we will continue to refine our candidate list using future data releases.

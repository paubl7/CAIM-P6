In the search for life on other planets, the presence of photosynthetic vegetation may be detectable
from the colors of light it reflects. On the modern Earth, this spectral reflectance is characterized
by an increase in reflectance between the red and near-infrared wavelengths, a "red edge". On planets
orbiting different stellar types, red edge analogs may occur at other colors than red. Thus, knowing
the wavelengths at which photosynthetic organisms preferentially absorb and reflect photons
is necessary to detect red edge analogs on other planets. Using a numerical model that predicts the
absorbance spectrum of extant photosynthetic pigments on Earth from Marosv\"olgyi and van Gorkom
(2010), we calculate the absorbance spectrum for pigments on an Earth-like planet around F through
late M type stars that are adapted for maximal energy production. In this model, cellular energy
production is maximized when pigments are tuned to absorb at the wavelength that maximizes energy
input from incident photons while minimizing thermal emission and costs to build the photosynthetic
apparatus. We find that peak photon absorption for photosynthetic organisms around F type stars
tends to be in the blue while for G, K, and early M type stars, red or just beyond is preferred. Around
the coolest M type stars, these organisms may preferentially absorb in the near-infrared, possibly
past one micron. These predictions are consistent with previous, qualitative estimates of pigment
absorptance. Our predicted pigment absorbance spectra depend on both the stellar type and planetary
atmospheric composition, especially atmospheric water vapor concentrations, which alter the
availability of surface photons and thus the predicted pigment absorption. By constraining the
absorbance spectra of alien, photosynthetic organisms, future observations may be better equipped
to detect red edge analogs.

We present a large sample of 2.5-38 $\mu m$ galaxy spectra drawn from a cross-archival comparison
in the AKARI-Spitzer Extragalactic Spectral Survey (ASESS), and investigate a subset of 113 star-forming
galaxies with prominent polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) emission spanning a wide range
of star formation properties. With AKARI's extended 2.5-5 $\mu m$ wavelength coverage, we self-consistently
model for the first time all PAH emission bands using a modified version of PAHFIT. We find $L_\mathrm{PAH\,3.3}/L_\mathrm{IR}$
$\sim$ 0.1% and the 3.3 $\mu m$ PAH feature contributes $\sim$1.5-3% to the total PAH power -- somewhat
less than earlier dust models have assumed. We establish a calibration between 3.3 $\mu m$ PAH emission
and star formation rate, but also find regimes where it loses reliability, including at high luminosity
and low metallicity. The 3.4 $\mu m$ aliphatic emission and a broad plateau feature centered at 3.47
$\mu m$ are also modeled. As the shortest wavelength PAH feature, 3.3 $\mu m$ is susceptible to attenuation,
leading to a factor of $\sim$ 3 differences in the inferred star formation rate at high obscuration
with different assumed attenuation geometries. Surprisingly, $L_\mathrm{PAH\, 3.3} / L_\mathrm{\Sigma\,
PAH}$ shows no sign of decline at high luminosities, and the low metallicity dwarf galaxy II Zw 40
exhibits an unusually strong 3.3 $\mu m$ band; both results suggest either that the smallest PAHs
are better able to survive under intense radiation fields than presumed, or that PAH emission is
shifted to shorter wavelengths in intense and high energy radiation environments. A photometric
surrogate for 3.3 $\mu m$ PAH luminosity using JWST/NIRCam is provided and found to be highly reliable
at low redshift.

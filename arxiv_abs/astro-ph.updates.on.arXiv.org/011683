[Abridged] Luminous hot stars dominate the stellar energy input to the interstellar medium throughout
cosmological time, they are laboratories to test theories of stellar evolution and multiplicity,
and they serve as luminous tracers of star formation in the Milky Way and other galaxies. Massive
stars occupy well-defined loci in colour-colour and colour-magnitude spaces, enabling selection
based on the combination of Gaia EDR3 astrometry and photometry and 2MASS photometry, even in the
presence of substantive dust extinction. In this paper we devise an all-sky sample of such luminous
OBA-type stars, designed to be quite complete rather than very pure, to serve as targets for spectroscopic
follow-up with the SDSS-V survey. We estimate "astro-kinematic" distances by combining parallaxes
and proper motions with a model for the expected velocity and density distribution of young stars;
we show that this adds useful constraints on the stars' distances, and hence luminosities. With
these distances we map the spatial distribution of a more stringently selected sub-sample across
the Galactic disc, and find it to be highly structured, with distinct over- and under-densities.
The most evident over-densities can be associated with the presumed spiral arms of the Milky Way,
in particular the Sagittarius-Carina and Scutum-Centaurus arms. Yet, the spatial picture of the
Milky Way's young disc structure emerging in this study is complex, and suggests that most young
stars in our Galaxy ($t_{age}<t_{dyn}$) are not neatly organised into distinct spiral arms. The
combination of the comprehensive spectroscopy to come from SDSS-V (yielding velocities, ages,
etc..) with future Gaia data releases will be crucial to reveal the dynamical nature of the spiral
arm themselves.

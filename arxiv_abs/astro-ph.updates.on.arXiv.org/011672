While it is generally accepted that the magnetic field and its non-ideal effects play important
roles during the stellar formation, simple models of pure hydrodynamics and angular momentum conservation
are still widely employed in the studies of disk assemblage in the framework of the so-called "alpha-disk"
model due to their simplicity. There has only been a few efforts trying to bridge the gap between a
collapsing prestellar core and a developed disk. The goal of the present work is to revisit the assemblage
of the protoplanetary disk (PPD), by performing 3D MHD simulations with ambipolar diffusion and
full radiative transfer. We follow the global evolution of the PPD from the prestellar core collapse
for 100 kyr, with resolution of one AU. The formed disk is more realistic and is in agreement with recent
observations of disks around class-0 young stellar objects. The mass flux arriving onto the disk
and the radial mass accretion rate within the disk are measured and compared to analytical self-similar
models. The surface mass flux is very centrally peaked, implying that most of the mass falling onto
the star does not transit through the mid-plane of the disk. The disk mid-plane is almost dead to turbulence,
whereas upper layers and the disk outer edge are very turbulent. The snow-line is significantly
further away than in a passive disk. We developed a zoomed rerun technique to quickly obtain a reasonable
disk that is highly stratified, weakly magnetized inside, and strongly magnetized outside. During
the class-0 phase of PPD formation, the interaction between the disk and the infalling envelope
is important and ought not be neglected. Accretion onto the star is found to mostly depend on dynamics
of the collapsing envelope, rather than the detailed disk structure.

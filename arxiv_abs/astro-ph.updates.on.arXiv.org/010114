Understanding how galaxies cease to form stars represents an outstanding challenge for galaxy
evolution theories. This process of "star formation quenching" has been related to various causes,
including Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) activity, the influence of large-scale dynamics, and the
environment in which galaxies live. In this paper, we present the first results from a follow-up
of CALIFA survey galaxies with observations of molecular gas obtained with the APEX telescope.
Together with EDGE survey CARMA observations, we collect $^{12}$CO observations that cover approximately
one effective radius in 472 CALIFA galaxies. We observe that the deficit of galaxy star formation
with respect to the star formation main sequence (SFMS) increases with the absence of molecular
gas and with a reduced efficiency of conversion of molecular gas into stars, in line with results
of other integrated studies. However, by dividing the sample into galaxies dominated by star formation
and galaxies quenched in their centres (as indicated by the average value of the H$\alpha$ equivalent
width), we find that this deficit increases sharply once a certain level of gas consumption is reached,
indicating that different mechanisms drive separation from the SFMS in star-forming and quenched
galaxies. Our results indicate that differences in the amount of molecular gas at a fixed stellar
mass are the primary driver for the dispersion in the SFMS, and the most likely explanation for the
start of star-formation quenching. However, once a galaxy is quenched, changes in star formation
efficiency drive how much a retired galaxy separates in star formation rate from star-forming ones
of similar masses. In other words, once a paucity of molecular gas has significantly reduced star
formation, changes in the star formation efficiency are what drives a galaxy deeper into the red
cloud, retiring it.

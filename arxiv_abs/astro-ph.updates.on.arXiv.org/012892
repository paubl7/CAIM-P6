We investigated the origin and gas properties of a simulated galaxy cluster pair, to connect simulation
predictions to the SRG/eROSITA X-ray observations of the Abell 3391/95 field. The simulated system
has been extracted from the (352 cMpc/h)^3 volume of the Magneticum Pathfinder cosmological simulations
at z=0.07. We tracked back in time the main progenitors of the pair clusters and surrounding groups
to study the assembly history of the system and its evolution. Similarly to the observed A3391/95
system, the simulated pair is embedded in a complex network of gas filaments, with structures aligned
over more than 20 projected Mpc and the whole region collapsing towards the central overdense node.
The spheres of influence (3*R200) of the two main clusters already overlap at z=0.07, but their virial
boundaries are still physically separated. The diffuse gas located in the interconnecting bridge
closely reflects the WHIM, with typical temperature of ~1 keV and overdensity $\sim 100$, with respect
to the mean baryon density of the Universe, and lower enrichment level compared to the ICM in clusters.
We find that most of the bridge gas collapsed from directions roughly orthogonal to the intra-cluster
gas accretion directions, and its origin is mostly unrelated to the two cluster progenitors. We
find clear signatures in the surrounding groups of infall motion towards the pair, such as significant
radial velocities and slowdown of gas compared to dark matter. These findings further support the
picture of the Northern Clump (MCXC J0621.7-5242) cluster infalling along a cosmic gas filament
towards Abell 3391, possibly merging with it. We conclude that, in such a configuration, the pair
clusters of the A3391/95-like system are in a pre-merger phase, and did not interact yet. The diffuse
gas in the interconnecting bridge is mostly warm filament gas, rather than tidally-stripped cluster
gas.

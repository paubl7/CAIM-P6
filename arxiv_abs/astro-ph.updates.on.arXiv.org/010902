We use the APOSTLE LCDM cosmological hydro-simulations of the Local Group to study the recent accretion
of massive satellites into the halo of Milky Way-sized galaxies. These systems are selected to be
analogues to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the most massive satellite of the Milky Way (MW).
The simulations allow us to address, in a cosmological context, a number of questions regarding
the impact of the Clouds on the MW, including the contribution of Magellanic satellites to the MW
satellite population, and the constraints placed on the Galactic potential by the motion of the
LMC. Our results indicate that LMC-like satellites are twice more common around Local Group-like
primaries than around isolated halos of similar mass; these satellites come from fairly large turnaround
radii (~400 kpc) and are on highly eccentric orbits whose velocities at first pericentre are comparable
with the primary's escape velocity. This implies V_esc^MW(50 kpc)~365 km/s, a strong constraint
on Galactic potential models. LMC analogues contribute only 2+-1 satellites with M*>10^5 Msun,
and have thus only a mild impact on the luminous satellite population of their hosts. LMC satellites
as luminous as the SMC seem rare, and none are found in our simulations. At first pericentre, LMC-associated
satellites are close to the LMC in position and velocity, and are distributed along the LMC's orbital
plane. Their orbital angular momenta are nearly parallel to the LMC's, but, interestingly, they
may appear to "counter-rotate" the MW in some cases. These criteria refine earlier estimates of
the LMC association of MW satellites: of all MW satellites with known distances and full velocity
data, only the SMC, Hydrus1, Car3, Hor1, Tuc4, Ret2 and Phx2 are clearly compatible with all criteria.
Carina, Grus2, Hor2 and Fornax are also possible associates, although their large LMC relative
velocity weakens their case.

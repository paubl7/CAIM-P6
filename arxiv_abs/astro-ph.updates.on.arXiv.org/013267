The advent of a new generation of radial velocity instruments has allowed us to break the one Earth-mass
barrier. We report a new milestone in this context with the detection of the lowest-mass planet measured
so far using radial velocities: L 98-59 b, a rocky planet with half the mass of Venus. It is part of a
system composed of three known transiting terrestrial planets (planets b to d). We announce the
discovery of a fourth nontransiting planet with a minimum mass of 3.06_{-0.37}^{+0.33} MEarth
and an orbital period of 12.796_{-0.019}^{+0.020} days and report indications for the presence
of a fifth nontransiting terrestrial planet. With a minimum mass of 2.46_{-0.82}^{+0.66} MEarth
and an orbital period 23.15_{-0.17}^{+0.60} days, this planet, if confirmed, would sit in the middle
of the habitable zone of the L 98-59 system. L 98-59 is a bright M dwarf located 10.6 pc away. Positioned
at the border of the continuous viewing zone of the James Webb Space Telescope, this system is destined
to become a corner stone for comparative exoplanetology of terrestrial planets. The three transiting
planets have transmission spectrum metrics ranging from 49 to 255, which makes them prime targets
for an atmospheric characterization with the James Webb Space Telescope, the Hubble Space Telescope,
Ariel, or ground-based facilities such as NIRPS or ESPRESSO. With an equilibrium temperature ranging
from 416 to 627 K, they offer a unique opportunity to study the diversity of warm terrestrial planets.
L 98-59 b and c have densities of 3.6_{-1.5}^{+1.4} and 4.57_{-0.85}^{+0.77} g.cm^{-3}, respectively,
and have very similar bulk compositions with a small iron core that represents only 12 to 14 % of the
total mass, and a small amount of water. However, with a density of 2.95_{-0.51}^{+0.79} g.cm^{-3}
and despite a similar core mass fraction, up to 30 % of the mass of L 98-59 d might be water.

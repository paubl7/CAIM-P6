We predict linear polarization for a radioactively-powered kilonova following the merger of a
black hole and a neutron star. Specifically, we perform 3-D Monte Carlo radiative transfer simulations
for two different models, both featuring a lanthanide-rich dynamical ejecta component from numerical-relativity
simulations while only one including an additional lanthanide-free disk wind component. We calculate
polarization spectra for nine different orientations at 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 d after the merger and in
the $0.1-2\,\mu$m wavelength range. We find that both models are polarized at a detectable level
1.5 d after the merger while show negligible levels thereafter. The polarization spectra of the
two models are significantly different. The model lacking a disk wind shows no polarization in the
optical, while a signal increasing at longer wavelengths and reaching $\sim1\%-6\%$ at $2\,\mu$m
depending on the orientation. The model with a disk-wind component, instead, features a characteristic
"double-peak" polarization spectrum with one peak in the optical and the other in the infrared.
Polarimetric observations of future events will shed light on the debated neutron richness of the
disk-wind component. The detection of optical polarization would unambiguously reveal the presence
of a lanthanide-free disk-wind component, while polarization increasing from zero in the optical
to a peak in the infrared would suggest a lanthanide-rich composition for the whole ejecta. Future
polarimetric campaigns should prioritize observations in the first $\sim48$ hours and in the $0.5-2\,\mu$m
range, where polarization is strongest, but also explore shorter wavelengths/later times where
no signal is expected from the kilonova and the interstellar polarization can be safely estimated.

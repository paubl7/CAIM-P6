In order to investigate the causes of different spectral slope in ccps, different grain-sizes of
Ceres analogue mixtures were produced, heated to remove absorption of atmospheric water, and spectrally
analyzed. First, the end-members which compose the Ceres surface (using the antigorite as Mg-phyllosilicate,
the NH4-montmorillonite as NH4-phyllosilicate, the dolomite as carbonate and the graphite as
dark component), were mixed, obtaining mixtures with different relative abundance, and identifying
the mixture with the reflectance spectrum most similar to the average Ceres spectrum. The mixtures
were obtained with grain size of 0-25 {\mu}m, 25-50 mic and 50-100 mic, were heated and spectrally
analysed at T= 300 K and T=200 K (typical for surface Ceres temperature during VIR observations).
The most similar Ceres analogue mixture is composed of dolomite (18%), graphite (27%), antigorite
(32%) and NH4-montmorillonite (29%) and the results of this work suggest that this mixture is more
similar to the Ceres youngest region than to the Ceres average, in particular for the negative slope
of spectrum. Small variation in the composition and grain size of end-members need to be considered,
in addition to the occurrence of a dark component dispersed in fine size. Furthermore, the positive
spectral slope that characterizes the mean Ceres spectrum can be obtained by the application of
some processes simulating the space weathering on Ceres (as micro-meteoritic impacts and solar
wind irradiation), i.e. laser and ion irradiation. As conclusion, youngest ccps on Ceresare probably
composed by fresher and weakly processed mixture with fine dark material intimately dispersed:
as a result, the reflectance spectra of youngest material show a negative slope in the 1.2-1.9 mic
range. The redder slope observed in the older ccps is probably the consequence of the space weathering
effects on fresher material

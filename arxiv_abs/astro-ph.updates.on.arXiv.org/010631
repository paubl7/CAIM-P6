WASP-121b is one of the most studied Ultra-hot Jupiters: many recent analyses of its atmosphere
report interesting features at different wavelength ranges. In this paper we analyze one transit
of WASP-121b acquired with the high-resolution spectrograph ESPRESSO at VLT in 1-telescope mode,
and one partial transit taken during the commissioning of the instrument in 4-telescope mode. We
investigate the anomalous in-transit radial velocity curve and study the transmission spectrum
of the planet. By analysing the in-transit radial velocities we were able to infer the presence of
the atmospheric Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. We measured the height of the planetary atmospheric
layer that correlates with the stellar mask (mainly Fe) to be 1.052$\pm$0.015 Rp and we also confirmed
the blueshift of the planetary atmosphere. By examining the planetary absorption signal on the
stellar cross-correlation functions we confirmed the presence of a temporal variation of its blueshift
during transit, which could be investigated spectrum-by-spectrum. We detected significant absorption
in the transmission spectrum for Na, H, K, Li, CaII, Mg, and we certified their planetary nature by
using the 2D tomographic technique. Particularly remarkable is the detection of Li, with a line
contrast of $\sim$0.2% detected at the 6$\sigma$ level. With the cross-correlation technique
we confirmed the presence of FeI, FeII, CrI and VI. H$\alpha$ and CaII are present up to very high altitudes
in the atmosphere ($\sim$1.44 Rp and $\sim$2 Rp, respectively), and also extend beyond the transit-equivalent
Roche lobe radius of the planet. These layers of the atmosphere have a large line broadening that
is not compatible with being caused by the tidally-locked rotation of the planet alone, and could
arise from vertical winds or high-altitude jets in the evaporating atmosphere.

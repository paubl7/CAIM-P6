The SRG observatory, equipped with the X-ray telescopes Mikhail Pavlinsky ART-XC and eROSITA,
was launched by Roscosmos to the L2 point on July 13, 2019. The launch was carried out from Baikonur
by a Proton-M rocket with a DM-03 upper stage. The German telescope eROSITA was installed on SRG under
agreement between Roskosmos and DLR. In December 2019, SRG started to scan the celestial sphere
in order to obtain X-ray maps of the entire sky in several energy bands (from 0.3 to 8 keV, eROSITA,
and from 4 to 30 keV, ART-XC). By mid-December 2020, the second full-sky scan had been completed.
Over 4 years, 8 independent maps of the sky will be obtained. Their sum will reveal more than three
million quasars and over one hundred thousand galaxy clusters and groups. The availability of 8
sky maps will enable monitoring of long-term variability (every six months) of a huge number of extragalactic
and Galactic X-ray sources, including hundreds of thousands of stars. Rotation of the satellite
around the axis directed toward the Sun with a period of 4 hours makes it possible to track faster variability
of bright X-ray sources. The chosen scanning strategy leads to the formation of deep survey zones
near both ecliptic poles. We present sky maps obtained by the telescopes aboard SRG during the first
scan of the sky and a number of results of deep observations performed during the flight to L2, demonstrating
the capabilities of the Observatory in imaging, spectroscopy and timing. In December 2023 the Observatory
will switch for at least two years to observations of the most interesting sources in the sky in triaxial
orientation mode and deep scanning of selected fields with an area of up to 150 sq. deg. These modes
of operation were tested during the Performance Verification phase. Every day, SRG data are dumped
onto the largest antennae of the Russian Deep Space Network in Bear Lakes and near Ussuriysk.

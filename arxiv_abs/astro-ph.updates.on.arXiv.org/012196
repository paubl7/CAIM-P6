One of the most important and well-established empirical results in astronomy is the Kennicutt-Schmidt
(KS) relation between the density of interstellar gas and the rate at which that gas forms stars.
A tight correlation between these quantities has long been measured at galactic scales. More recently,
using surveys of YSOs, a KS relationship has been found within molecular clouds relating the surface
density of star formation to the surface density of gas; however, the scaling of these laws varies
significantly from cloud to cloud. In this Letter, we use a recently developed, high-accuracy catalog
of young stellar objects from $\textit{Spitzer}$ combined with high-dynamic-range gas column
density maps of twelve nearby ($<$1.5 kpc) molecular clouds from $\textit{Herschel}$ to re-examine
the KS relation within individual molecular clouds. We find a tight, linear correlation between
clouds' star formation rate per unit area and their gas surface density normalized by the gas free-fall
time. The measured intracloud KS relation, which relates star formation rate to the volume density,
extends over more than two orders of magnitude within each cloud and is nearly identical in each of
the twelve clouds, implying a constant star formation efficiency per free-fall time $\epsilon_{\rm
ff}\approx 0.026$. The finding of a universal correlation within individual molecular clouds,
including clouds that contain no massive stars or massive stellar feedback, favors models in which
star formation is regulated by local processes such as turbulence or stellar feedback such as protostellar
outflows, and disfavors models in which star formation is regulated only by galaxy properties or
supernova feedback on galactic scales.

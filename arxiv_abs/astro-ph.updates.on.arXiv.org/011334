Context: Asteroids up to a few tens of meters in diameter may spin very fast, completing an entire
rotation in a period of few minutes. These small and fast rotating bodies are thought to be monolithic
objects, since the weak gravitational force due to their small size is not strong enough to counteract
the large centripetal force caused by the fast rotation. Additionally, it is not clear whether the
fast spin prevents dust and small particles (regolith) to be kept on their surface. Aims: We aim to
develop a model to constrain the thermal conductivity of the surface of the small, fast-rotating
near-Earth asteroids. This model may suggest whether the presence of regolith is likely or not.
Methods: Our approach is based on the comparison between the measured Yarkovsky drift and a predicted
value using a theoretical model, which depends on the orbital, physical and thermal parameters
of the object. The necessary parameters are either deduced from statistical distribution derived
for near-Earth asteroids population or determined from observations with associated uncertainty.
With that information available, we perform Monte Carlo simulations, producing a probability
density distribution for the thermal conductivity. Results: Applying our model to the super-fast
rotator asteroid (499998) 2011 PT, we find that the measured Yarkovsky drift can be achieved only
if the thermal conductivity $K$ of the surface is low. The resulting probability density function
for the conductivity is bimodal, with two most likely values being around 0.0001 and 0.005 W m$^{-1}$
K$^{-1}$. Based on this, we find that the probability of $K$ being smaller than 0.1 W m$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$
is at least 95 per cent. This low thermal conductivity could be a clue that the surface of 2011 PT is
covered with a thermal insulating layer, composed by a regolith-like material similar to lunar
dust.

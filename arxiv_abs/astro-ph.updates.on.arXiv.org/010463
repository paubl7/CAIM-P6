A pointing accuracy better than 1"(3{\sigma}) star tracker plays a significant role for the advanced
scientific missions. This thesis makes a series of studies on the typical error sources associated
with the positioning and calibration processes, such as the centroiding algorithm, detector noise,
motion, focal length drift, variation of the center wavelength of stellar spectrum, the model error,
etc., some works of which are listed as follows: IWCOG algorithm is studied for the characteristics
of both the accuracy and efficiency. Using Cram\'er-Rao Lower Bound theorem,centified to have
an approximate optimum property for signal with Possion noise and the optimum feature in case of
Gaussian noise. In order to enhance the dynamic performance, the generallized dynamic compensation
formula is derived to compensate out the error from motion. decoupling of three technical indicators
including dynamic performance, pointing accuracy and attitude output rate. To solve the problems
exhibited in the in-orbit correction procedure, a brilliant idea, known as the CRLB constraint
method, is presented to minimize some small error sources. To fulfill this goal, the full CRLB constaint
formulas are derived to build a budget to limit the in-flight parameters. Using this method the overall
error are obtained, which in turn results in three significant inferences. The attitude determination
process is further optimized, by giving different weights to each star according to their magnitudes
and the position over different star field, the QUEST algorithm is thus upgraded. The results show
that this method can improve the attitude measurement accuracy statistically by 10-20%. The theory
and deductions can be directly applied to various types of star trackers, whether it is a super-high
accuracy one, or a high dynamic one.

We present a catalogue of homogeneous determined chromospheric emission (CE), stellar atmospheric
parameters and ages for 1,674 FGK main sequence (MS), subgiant, and giant stars. The analysis of
CE level and variability is also performed. We measured CE in the CaII lines using more than 180,000
high-resolution spectra from the HARPS spectrograph, as compiled in the AMBRE project, obtained
between 2003 and 2019. We converted the fluxes to bolometric and photospheric corrected chromospheric
emission ratio, $R'_\text{HK}$. Stellar atmospheric parameters $T_\text{eff}$, $\log g$, and
[Fe/H] were retrieved from the literature or determined using an homogeneous method. $M_\star$,
$R_\star$, and ages were determined from isochrone fitting. We analysed the CE distribution for
the different luminosity classes and spectral types and confirmed the existence of the very inactive
stars (VIS) and very active stars (VAS) populations at $\log R'_\text{HK}< -5.1$ and $> -4.2$ dex,
respectively. We found indications that the VIS population is composed mainly of subgiant and giant
stars and that $\log R'_\text{HK}= -5.1$ dex marks a transition in stellar evolution. There appears
to be at least three regimes of variability, for inactive, active and very active stars, with the
inactive and active regimes separated by a diagonal Vaughan-Preston gap. We show that stars with
low activity levels do not necessarily have low variability. In the case of K dwarfs which show high
CE variability, inactive and active stars have similar levels of activity variability. This means
that activity levels alone are not enough to infer about the activity variability of a star. We also
explained the shape of the VP gap observed in the distribution of CE by using the CE variability-level
diagram. In the CE variability-level diagram, the Sun is located in the high variability region
of the inactive MS stars zone. (Abridged)

Ancient ($>$10 Gyr) globular clusters (GCs) show chemical abundance variations in the form of patterns
among certain elements, e.g. N correlates with Na and anti-correlates with O. Recently, N abundance
spreads have also been observed in massive star clusters that are significantly younger than old
GCs, down to an age of $\sim$2 Gyr. However, so far N has been the only element found to vary in such young
objects. We report here the presence of Na abundance variations in the intermediate age massive
star clusters NGC 416 ($\sim$6.5 Gyr old) and Lindsay 1 ($\sim$7.5 Gyr old) in the Small Magellanic
Cloud, by combining HST and ESO-VLT MUSE observations. Using HST photometry we were able to construct
''chromosome maps'' and separate sub-populations with different N content, in the red giant branch
of each cluster. MUSE spectra of individual stars belonging to each population were combined, resulting
in high signal-to-noise spectra representative of each population, which were compared to search
for mean differences in Na. We find a mean abundance variation of $\Delta$[Na/Fe]$=0.18\pm0.04$
dex for NGC 416 and $\Delta$[Na/Fe]$=0.24\pm0.05$ dex for Lindsay 1. In both clusters we find that
the population that is enhanced in N is also enhanced in Na, which is the same pattern to the one observed
in ancient GCs. Furthermore, we detect a bimodal distribution of core-helium burning Red Clump
(RC) giants in the UV colour magnitude diagram of NGC 416. A comparison of the stacked MUSE spectra
of the two RCs shows the same mean Na abundance difference between the two populations. The results
reported in this work are a crucial hint that star clusters of a large age range share the same origin:
they are the same types of objects, but only separated in age.

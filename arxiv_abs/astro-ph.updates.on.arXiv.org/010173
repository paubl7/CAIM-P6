We present observations and detailed characterizations of five new host galaxies of fast radio
bursts (FRBs) discovered with the Australian Square Kilometre Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) and localized
to $\lesssim 1''$. Combining these galaxies with FRB hosts from the literature, we introduce criteria
based on the probability of chance coincidence to define a sub-sample of 10 highly-confident associations
(at $z=0.03-0.52$), three of which correspond to known repeating FRBs. Overall, the FRB host galaxies
exhibit a broad, continuous range of color ($M_u-M_r = 0.9 - 2.0$), stellar mass ($M_\star = 10^{8}
- 6\times 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$), and star-formation rate (${\rm SFR} = 0.05 - 10\,M_{\odot}\,{\rm
yr}^{-1}$) spanning the full parameter space occupied by $z<0.5$ galaxies. However, they do not
track the color-magnitude, SFR-$M_\star$, nor BPT diagrams of field galaxies surveyed at similar
redshifts. There is an excess of "green valley" galaxies and an excess of emission-line ratios indicative
of a harder radiation field than that generated by star-formation alone. From the observed stellar
mass distribution, we rule out the hypothesis that FRBs strictly track stellar mass in galaxies
($>99\%$ c.l.). We measure a median offset of 3.3 kpc from the FRB to the estimated center of the host
galaxies and compare the host-burst offset distribution and other properties with the distributions
of long- and short-duration gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs and SGRBs), core-collapse supernovae (CC-SNe),
and Type Ia SNe. This analysis rules out galaxies hosting LGRBs (faint, star-forming galaxies)
as common hosts for FRBs ($>95\%$ c.l.). Other transient channels (SGRBs, CC- and Type Ia SNe) have
host galaxy properties and offsets consistent with the FRB distributions. All of the data and derived
quantities are made publicly available on a dedicated website and repository.

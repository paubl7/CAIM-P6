The mass of a supermassive black hole ($M_\mathrm{BH}$) is a fundamental property that can be obtained
through observational methods. Constraining $M_\mathrm{BH}$ through multiple methods for an
individual galaxy is important for verifying the accuracy of different techniques, and for investigating
the assumptions inherent in each method. NGC 4151 is one of those rare galaxies for which multiple
methods can be used: stellar and gas dynamical modeling because of its proximity ($D=15.8\pm0.4$
Mpc from Cepheids), and reverberation mapping because of its active accretion. In this work, we
re-analyzed $H-$band integral field spectroscopy of the nucleus of NGC 4151 from Gemini NIFS, improving
the analysis at several key steps. We then constructed a wide range of axisymmetric dynamical models
with the new orbit-superposition code Forstand. One of our primary goals is to quantify the systematic
uncertainties in $M_\mathrm{BH}$ arising from different combinations of the deprojected density
profile, inclination, intrinsic flattening, and mass-to-light ratio. As a consequence of uncertainties
on the stellar luminosity profile arising from the presence of the AGN, our constraints on \mbh are
rather weak. Models with a steep central cusp are consistent with no black hole; however, in models
with more moderate cusps, the black hole mass lies within the range of $0.25\times10^7\,M_\odot
\lesssim M_\mathrm{BH} \lesssim 3\times10^7\,M_\odot$. This measurement is somewhat smaller
than the earlier analysis presented by Onken et al., but agrees with previous $M_\mathrm{BH}$ values
from gas dynamical modeling and reverberation mapping. Future dynamical modeling of reverberation
data, as well as IFU observations with JWST, will aid in further constraining $M_\mathrm{BH}$ in
NGC 4151.

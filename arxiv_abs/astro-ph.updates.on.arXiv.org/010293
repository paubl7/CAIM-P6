Young stars interact with their accretion disk through their strong magnetosphere. We investigate
the magnetospheric accretion process in the young stellar system DoAr 44. We monitored the system
over several rotational cycles, combining high-resolution optical and near-IR spectropolarimetry
with long-baseline near-IR interferometry and multicolor photometry. DoAr 44 is a young 1.2 solar
mass star, moderately accreting from its disk, and seen at a low inclination. We derive a rotational
period of 2.96 d from the system's light curve. Several optical and near-IR line profiles probing
the accretion funnel flows and the accretion shock are modulated at the stellar rotation period.
The most variable line profile, HeI 1083 nm, exhibits modulated redshifted wings a signature of
accretion funnel flows, as well as deep blueshifted absorptions indicative of transient outflows.
The Zeeman-Doppler analysis suggests the star hosts a mainly dipolar magnetic field, inclined
by about 20 deg. onto the spin axis, with an intensity reaching about 800 G at the photosphere, and
up to 2 +/- 0.8 kG close to the accretion shock. The magnetic field appears strong enough to disrupt
the inner disk close to the corotation radius, at a distance of about 4.6 stellar radii (0.043 au).
This supports the upper limit of 5 stellar radii (0.047 au) we derived for the size of the magnetosphere
from long baseline interferometry. DoAr 44 is a pre-transitional disk system, exhibiting a 25-30
au gap in its circumstellar disk, with the inner and outer disks being misaligned. On a scale of 0.1
au or less, our results indicate that the system steadily accretes from its inner disk through its
tilted dipolar magnetosphere. We conclude that in spite of a highly structured outer disk, perhaps
the signature of ongoing planetary formation, the magnetospheric accretion process proceeds
unimpeded at the star-disk interaction level.

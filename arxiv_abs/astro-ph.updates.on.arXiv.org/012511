The concept for space interferometry from Polar or Equatorial Circular Medium Earth Orbits (the
PECMEO concept) is a promising way to acquire the image of the "shadow" of the event horizon of Sagittarius
A* with an angular resolution of circa 5 microarcseconds. The concept is intended to decrease the
size of the main reflector of the instrument to about 3 m using a precise orbit reconstruction based
on Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) navigation, inter-satellite range and range-rate
measurements, and data from the Attitude and Orbit Determination System (AODS). The paper provides
the current progress on the definition of the subsystems required for the concept on the basis of
simulations, radio regulations, and available technology. The paper proposes the requirement
for the localization of the phase centre of the main reflector. The paper provides information about
the visibility of GNSS satellites and the needed accuracies of the AODS. The paper proposes the frequency
plan for the instrument and its Inter-Satellite Links (ISLs). The concepts for measurement of range
and range rate using ISLs (as well as for the data exchange at these ISLs) are presented. The block
diagram of the interferometer is described and its sensitivity is estimated. The link budget for
both ISLs is given as well as their critical components. The calculated measurement quality factors
are given. The paper shows the expected performance of the sub-systems of the interferometer. The
requirements for the localization of the main reflectors and the information about the availability
of the GNSS satellites are based on the simulations results. (Two sentences have been deleted in

information for the development of the orbit reconstruction filter and the whole PECMEO system.

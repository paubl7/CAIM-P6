While the standard cosmological model, $\Lambda$CDM, agrees well with a host of cosmological data
on large scales, a number of contentious small-scale tensions and the unknown physical (e.g. particle)
nature of dark matter motivate the exploration of alternative scenarios. An ultra-light bosonic
particle of mass in the range $\approx 10^{-22}\,\mathrm{eV}/c^2$ is of special interest, as it
both has particle physics motivations, and may give rise to notable differences in the structures
on highly non-linear scales due to the manifestation of quantum-physical wave effects on macroscopic
scales. Using a spectral technique, we here discuss simulations of such fuzzy dark matter (FDM)
with a comparatively large dynamic range and for larger box sizes than considered previously. We
focus on the evolution of the matter power spectrum, and give first results for the FDM halo mass function
directly based on FDM simulations. Unlike in $\Lambda$CDM, it is computationally challenging
to accurately treat the growth on large scales in FDM, even in the regime where this follows linear
theory. Once sufficient numerical resolution is available, FDM shows a pronounced suppression
of power on small scales relative to cold dark matter (CDM), which can be understood as a damping effect
due to 'quantum pressure'. In certain regimes, however, the FDM power can exceed that of CDM, which
may be interpreted as a reflection of order-unity density fluctuations occurring in FDM. The halo
mass functions are identical for massive haloes, but FDM shows a significant abundance reduction
below a characteristic mass scale. This could in principle alleviate the need to invoke very strong
feedback processes in small galaxies to reconcile $\Lambda$CDM with the observed galaxy luminosity
function, but detailed studies that also include baryons will be needed to ultimately judge the
viability of FDM.

High-mass gamma-ray binaries consist of a presumptive pulsar in orbit with a massive star. The intense
outflows from the star can absorb radio emission from the pulsar, making the detection of pulsation
difficult. In this work, we present the basic geometry and formulae that describe the absorption
process of a pulsar in binary with an O/B star and apply our model to two typical and well-studied binaries:
PSR~B1259-63/LS~2883 and LS 5039. We investigate the influences of the equatorial disc of LS 2883
with different orientations on the dispersion measure and free-free absorption of the radio pulsation
from PSR B1259-63. The observed data are consistent with the disc inserted on the orbital plane with
a relatively large inclination angle. For LS 5039, due to its tight orbit, it was believed that the
strong wind absorption makes detecting radio emissions from the putative pulsar unlikely. However,
considering the wind interaction and orbital motion, a bow shock cavity and a Coriolis shock would
be formed, thereby allowing the pulsations to partially avoid stellar outflow absorption. We investigate
the dependence of the radio optical depth on the observing frequencies, the orbital inclination
angle, and the wind parameters. We suppose that the presumptive pulsar in LS 5039 is similar to PSR
B1259-63 with pulsed emission extending to several tens of gigahertz. In that case, there could
be a transparent window for radio pulsations when the pulsar is moving around the inferior conjunction.
The following deep monitoring of LS 5039 and other systems by radio telescopes at high radio frequencies
might reveal the nature of compact objects in the future. Alternatively, even a null detection could
still provide further constraints on the properties of the putative pulsar and stellar outflows.

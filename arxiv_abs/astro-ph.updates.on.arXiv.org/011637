The recently-discovered giant exoplanet HR5183b exists on a wide, highly-eccentric orbit ($a=18$\,au,
$e=0.84$). Its host star possesses a common proper-motion companion which is likely on a bound orbit.
In this paper, we explore scenarios for the excitation of the eccentricity of the planet in binary
systems such as this, considering planet-planet scattering, Lidov-Kozai cycles from the binary
acting on a single-planet system, or Lidov-Kozai cycles acting on a two-planet system that also
undergoes scattering. Planet-planet scattering, in the absence of a binary companion, has a $2.8-7.2\%$
probability of pumping eccentricities to the observed values in our simulations, depending on
the relative masses of the two planets. Lidov-Kozai cycles from the binary acting on an initially
circular orbit can excite eccentricities to the observed value, but require very specific orbital
configurations for the binary and overall there is a low probability of catching the orbit at the
high observed high eccentricity ($0.6\%$). The best case is provided by planet-planet scattering
in the presence of a binary companion: here, the scattering provides the surviving planet with an
initial eccentricity boost that is subsequently further increased by Kozai cycles from the binary.
We find a success rate of $10.4\%$ for currently observing $e\ge0.84$ in this set-up. The single-planet
plus binary and two-planet plus binary cases are potentially distinguishable if the mutual inclination
of the binary and the planet can be measured, as the latter permits a broader range of mutual inclinations.
The combination of scattering and Lidov-Kozai forcing may also be at work in other wide-orbit eccentric
giant planets, which have a high rate of stellar binary companions.

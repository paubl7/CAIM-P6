Understanding the chemical interactions between water and Mg-silicates or iron is essential to
constrain the interiors of water-rich planets. Hydration effects have, however, been mostly neglected
by the astrophysics community so far. As such effects are unlikely to have major impacts on theoretical
mass-radius relations this is justified as long as the measurement uncertainties are large. However,
upcoming missions, such as the PLATO mission (scheduled launch 2026), are envisaged to reach a precision
of up to $\approx 3 \%$ and $\approx 10 \%$ for radii and masses, respectively. As a result, we may soon
enter an area in exoplanetary research where various physical and chemical effects such as hydration
can no longer be ignored. Our goal is to construct interior models for planets that include reliable
prescriptions for hydration of the cores and the mantles. These models can be used to refine previous
results for which hydration has been neglected and to guide future characterization of observed
exoplanets. We have developed numerical tools to solve for the structure of multi-layered planets
with variable boundary conditions and compositions. Here we consider three types of planets: dry
interiors, hydrated interiors and dry interiors + surface ocean where the ocean mass fraction corresponds
to the mass fraction of $\rm H_2 O$ equivalent in the hydrated case. We find H/OH storage capacities
in the hydrated planets equivalent to $0-6 \rm \ wt\% \ \rm H_{2}O$ corresponding to up to $\approx
800 \rm \ km$ deep ocean layers. In the mass range $0.1 \leq M/M_\oplus \leq 3$ the effect of hydration
on the total radius is found to be $\leq 2.5\%$ whereas the effect of differentiation into an isolated
surface ocean is $\leq 5 \ \%$. Furthermore, we find that our results are very sensitive to the bulk
composition.

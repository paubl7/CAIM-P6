Thanks to very deep spectroscopic observations carried out at the Large Binocular Telescope, we
measured simultaneously stellar age, metallicity and velocity dispersion for C1-23152, an ETG
at redshift $z$=3.352, corresponding to an epoch when the Universe was $\sim$1.8 Gyr old. The analysis
of its spectrum shows that this galaxy, hosting an AGN, formed and assembled $\sim$2$\times$10$^{11}$
M$_\odot$ shaping its morphology within the $\sim$600 Myr preceding the observations, since $z$$\sim$4.6.
The stellar population has a mean mass-weighted age 400$^{+30}_{-70}$ Myr and it is formed between
$\sim$600 Myr and $\sim$150 Myr before the observed epoch, this latter being the time since quenching.
Its high stellar velocity dispersion, $\sigma_e$=409$\pm$60 km s$^{-1}$, confirms the high mass
(M$_{dyn}$=$2.2(\pm0.4)$$\times$10$^{11}$ M$_\odot$) and the high mass density ($\Sigma_e^{M^*}$=$\Sigma_{1kpc}=3.2(\pm0.7)\times10^{10}$
M$_\odot$ kpc$^{-2}$), suggesting a fast dissipative process at its origin. The analysis points
toward a supersolar metallicity, [Z/H]=0.25$^{+0.006}_{-0.10}$, in agreement with the above
picture, suggesting a star formation efficiency much higher than the replenishment time. However,
sub-solar metallicity values cannot be firmly ruled out by our analysis. Quenching must have been
extremely efficient to reduce the star formation to SFR$<$6.5 M$_\odot$ yr$^{-1}$ in less than
150 Myr. This could be explained by the presence of the AGN, even if a causal relation cannot be established
from the data. C1-23152 has the same stellar and physical properties of the densest ETGs in the local
Universe of comparable mass, suggesting that they are C1-23152-like galaxies which evolved to
$z=0$ unperturbed.

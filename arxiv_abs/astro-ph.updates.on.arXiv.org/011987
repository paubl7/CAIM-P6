The galaxy quenching process, in which a galaxy stops forming stars is a crucial stage in galaxy life.
Two mechanisms for quenching are possible: halo mass quenching of central galaxies and environmental
quenching of satellite galaxies. This thesis describes the satellite galaxies (SG) quenching
process and its primary causes. The analysis contains a study of a large sample of 118 SGs within the
Vela cosmological simulation, identified by a specific SG merger tree algorithm. We find that the
quenching evolves through a typical path in the diagram of specific star formation (sSFR) vs. inner
stellar surface density ($\Sigma_{\star, 0.5\textrm kpc}$), with the inner surface density defined
as the density within 0.5kpc from the center of mass of the SG. Three discrete phases characterize
this path: 1. Halt in gas accretion with SG compaction at high sSFR as the SG keeps forming stars 2.
Gas removal and rapid drop in the sSFR at the peri-center of its orbit within the host halo 3. Stellar
heating and stripping may lead to coalescing with the halo center, an ultra-diffuse galaxy (UDG),
a compact elliptical galaxy (eCg), or a globular cluster (GC). We find that the main drivers of SG
evolution are ram pressure stripping at the initial stages and tidal forces at the final stages,
aided by starvation, suppression of gas accretion. We show that other processes, such as gas depletion
by star formation or stellar feedback are secondary. Moreover, we present an innovative method
for constructing merger trees in simulations that solve systemic errors. Two new significant results
presented here: a. Decoupling of dark-matter from the stellar component in SGs. b. Compact elliptical
SG formation. An assembly of these results and others are presented in a fast and robust catalog.

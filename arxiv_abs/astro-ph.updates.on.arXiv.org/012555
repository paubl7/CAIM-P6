Direct dynamical mass measurements of stars with masses above 30 M${}_\odot$ are rare. This is the
result of the low yield of the upper initial mass function and the limited number of such systems in
eclipsing binaries. Long-period, double-lined spectroscopic binaries that are also resolved
astrometrically offer an alternative for obtaining absolute masses of stellar objects. 9 Sgr is
one such long-period, high-mass binary. Unfortunately, a large amount of tension exists between
its total dynamical mass inferred from radial velocity measurements and that from astrometric
data. We obtained the astrometric orbit from VLTI/PIONIER and VLTI/GRAVITY interferometric measurements.
Using archival and new spectroscopy, we performed a grid-based spectral disentangling search
to constrain the semi-amplitudes of the radial velocity curves. We computed atmospheric parameters
and surface abundances by adjusting \textsc{fastwind} atmosphere models and we compared our results
with evolutionary tracks computed with the Bonn Evolutionary Code (BEC). Grid spectral disentangling
of 9 Sgr supports the presence of a 53 M${}_\odot$ primary and a 39 M${}_\odot$ secondary. Comparison
with BEC evolutionary tracks shows the components of 9 Sgr are most likely coeval with an age of roughly
1 Myr. Our analysis clears up the contradiction between mass and orbital inclination estimates
reported in previous studies. We detect the presence of significant CNO-processed material at
the surface of the primary, suggesting enhanced internal mixing compared to currently implemented
in the BEC models. The present measurements provide a high-quality high-mass anchor to validate
stellar evolution models and to test the efficiency of internal mixing processes.

The extreme extinction ($A_V\sim30$) and its variation on arc-second scales towards the Galactic
centre hamper the study of its stars. Their analysis is restricted to the near infrared (NIR) regime,
where the extinction curve can be approximated by a broken power law for the $JHK_s$ bands. Therefore,
correcting for extinction is fundamental to analyse the structure and stellar population of the
central regions of our Galaxy. We aim at: (1) Discussing different strategies to de-redden the photometry
and checking the usefulness of extinction maps to deal with variable stars. (2) Building extinction
maps for the NIR bands $JHK_s$. (3) Creating a de-reddened GALACTICNUCLEUS (GNS) survey, identifying
foreground stars. (4) Performing a preliminary analysis of the de-reddened $K_s$ luminosity functions
(KLFs). We use photometry from the GNS survey to create extinction maps for the whole catalogue.
We take red clump (RC) and red giant stars of similar brightness as a reference to build the maps, and
de-redden the GNS photometry. We discuss the limitations of the process and analyse non-linear
effects. We create high resolution ($\sim3''$) extinction maps with low statistical and systematics
uncertainties ($\lesssim5$\,\%), and compute average extinctions for each of the regions covered
by the GNS. We check that our maps effectively correct the differential extinction reducing the
spread of the RC features by a factor of $\sim2$. We assess the validity of the broken power law approach
computing two equivalent extinction maps $A_H$ using either $JH$ and $HK_s$ photometry for the
same reference stars, and obtain compatible average extinctions within the uncertainties. Finally,
we analyse de-reddened KLFs for different line-of-sights and find that the regions belonging to
the NSD contain a homogeneous stellar population that is significantly different from the one in
the innermost bulge regions.

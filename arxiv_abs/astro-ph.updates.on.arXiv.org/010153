We investigate the redshift and blueshift of light emitted by timelike geodesic particles in orbits
around a Kerr-Newman-(anti) de Sitter (KN(a)dS) black hole. Specifically we compute the redshift
and blueshift of photons that are emitted by geodesic massive particles and travel along null geodesics
towards a distant observer-located at a finite distance from the KN(a)dS black hole. For this purpose
we use the Killing-vector formalism and the associated first integrals-constants of motion. We
consider in detail stable timelike equatorial circular orbits of stars and express their corresponding
redshift/blueshift in terms of the metric physical black hole parameters (angular momentum per
unit mass, mass, electric charge and the cosmological constant) and the orbital radii of both the
emitter star and the distant observer. These radii are linked through the constants of motion along
the null geodesics followed by the photons since their emission until their detection and as a result
we get closed form analytic expressions for the orbital radius of the observer in terms of the emitter
radius, and the black hole parameters. In addition, we compute exact analytic expressions for the
frame dragging of timelike spherical orbits in the KN(a)dS spacetime in terms of multivariable
generalised hypergeometric functions of Lauricella and Appell. We solve the conditions for timelike
spherical orbits in KN(a)dS and KN spacetimes. We present new, elegant compact forms for the parameters
of these orbits. Last but not least we derive a very elegant and novel exact formula for the periapsis
advance for a test particle in a non-spherical polar orbit in KNdS black hole spacetime in terms of
Jacobi's elliptic function sn and Lauricella's hypergeometric function $F_D$.

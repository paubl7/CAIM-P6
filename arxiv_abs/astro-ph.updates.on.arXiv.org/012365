Establishing the origin of the water D/H ratio in the Solar System is central to our understanding
of the chemical trail of water during the star and planet formation process. Recent modeling suggests
that comparisons of the D$_2$O/HDO and HDO/H$_2$O ratios are a powerful way to trace the chemical
evolution of water and, in particular, determine whether the D/H ratio is inherited from the molecular
cloud or established locally. We seek to determine the D$_2$O column density and derive the D$_2$O/HDO
ratios in the warm region toward the low-mass Class 0 sources B335 and L483. The results are compared
with astrochemical models and previous observations to determine their implications for the chemical
evolution of water. We present ALMA observations of the D$_2$O transition at 316.8 GHz toward B335
and L483 at $<$0.5" ($<$ 100 au) resolution, probing the inner warm envelope gas. The column densities
of D$_2$O, HDO, and H$_{2}^{18}$O are determined by synthetic spectrum modeling and direct Gaussian
fitting, under the assumption of a single excitation temperature and similar spatial extent for
the three water isotopologs. D$_2$O is detected toward both sources in the inner warm envelope.
The derived D$_2$O/HDO ratios is $(1.0\pm0.2)\times10^{-2}$ for L483 and $(1.4\pm0.1)\times10^{-2}$
for B335. The high D$_2$O/HDO ratios are a strong indication of chemical inheritance of water from
the prestellar phase down to the inner warm envelope. This implies that the local cloud conditions
in the prestellar phase, such as temperatures and timescales, determine the water chemistry at
later stages and could provide a source of chemical differentiation in young systems. In addition,
the observed D$_2$O/H$_2$O ratios support an observed dichotomy in the deuterium fractionation
of water toward isolated and clustered protostars, namely, a higher D/H ratio toward isolated sources

We present measurements of the radial gravitational acceleration around isolated galaxies, comparing
the expected gravitational acceleration given the baryonic matter with the observed gravitational
acceleration, using weak lensing measurements from the fourth data release of the Kilo-Degree
Survey. These measurements extend the radial acceleration relation (RAR) by 2 decades into the
low-acceleration regime beyond the outskirts of the observable galaxy. We compare our RAR measurements
to the predictions of two modified gravity (MG) theories: MOND and Verlinde's emergent gravity.
We find that the measured RAR agrees well with the MG predictions. In addition, we find a difference
of at least $6\sigma$ between the RARs of early- and late-type galaxies (split by S\'{e}rsic index
and $u-r$ colour) with the same stellar mass. Current MG theories involve a gravity modification
that is independent of other galaxy properties, which would be unable to explain this behaviour.
The difference might be explained if only the early-type galaxies have significant ($M_{gas} \approx
M_*$) circumgalactic gaseous haloes. The observed behaviour is also expected in $\Lambda$CDM
models where the galaxy-to-halo mass relation depends on the galaxy formation history. We find
that MICE, a $\Lambda$CDM simulation with hybrid halo occupation distribution modelling and abundance
matching, reproduces the observed RAR but significantly differs from BAHAMAS, a hydrodynamical
cosmological galaxy formation simulation. Our results are sensitive to the amount of circumgalactic
gas; current observational constraints indicate that the resulting corrections are likely moderate.
Measurements of the lensing RAR with future cosmological surveys will be able to further distinguish
between MG and $\Lambda$CDM models if systematic uncertainties in the baryonic mass distribution
around galaxies are reduced.

Context. The blazar OJ 287 has been proposed as a binary black hole system based on its periodic optical
outburst. Among blazars with parsec scale jets, the black hole binary systems are very rare and hence
this source is very interesting to study. Aims. The BL Lac OJ 287 is an interesting object for multi-wavelength
study due to its periodic outbursts. We have analyzed the optical, X-ray, and gamma-ray data of OJ
287 for the period of 2017-2020. There are several high states in optical-UV and X-ray frequencies
during this period. Based on the observed variability in optical and X-ray frequencies the entire
period 2017-2020 is divided into five segments, referred to as A, B, C, D, & E in this paper. A detailed
temporal and spectral analysis is performed to understand the nature of its flaring activities.
Methods. To understand the temporal variability in this source we have studied the intra-day, and
fractional variability for all the various states, and along with that fast variability time was
also estimated to understand the nature of variability. Further, the multi-wavelength SED modeling
is performed to know more about the physical processes responsible for the simultaneous broadband
emission and the fast variability. Results. The Fermi-LAT observations show a moderate flux level
of this source in gamma-ray frequency throughout this period, though flux variability has been
observed. The source has shown a strong flux variability in X-ray, optical, and UV during early 2017
and mid-2020 when the source was in a very high state. A single zone SSC emission model is considered
to model the spectral energy distributions and this helps us to explore the nature of this BL Lac with
binary super-massive black holes.

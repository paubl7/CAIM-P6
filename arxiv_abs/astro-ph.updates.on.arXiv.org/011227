IGR J18027-2016 is an obscured high-mass X-ray binary formed by a neutron star accreting from the
wind of a supergiant companion with a $\sim$4.57 day orbital period. The source shows an asymmetric
eclipse profile that remained stable across several years. We aim at investigating the geometrical
and physical properties of stellar wind structures formed by the interaction between the compact
object and the supergiant star. In this work we analyse the temporal and spectral evolution of this
source along its orbit using six archival XMM-Newton observations and the accumulated Swift/BAT
hard X-ray light curve. XMM-Newton light curves show that the source hardens during the ingress
and egress of the eclipse, in accordance with the asymmetric profile seen in Swift/BAT data. A reduced
pulse modulation is observed on the ingress to the eclipse. We model XMM-Newton spectra by means
of a thermally-comptonized continuum (nthcomp) adding two gaussian emission lines corresponding
to Fe K$\alpha$ and Fe K$\beta$. We included two absorption components to account for the interstellar
and intrinsic media. We found that the local absorption column outside the eclipse fluctuates uniformly
around $\sim$ 6$\times$10$^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$, whereas, when the source enters and leaves the eclipse,
the column increases by a factor of $\gtrsim$3, reaching values up to $\sim$35 and $\sim$15$\times
10^{22}$~cm$^{-2}$, respectively. Combining the physical properties derived from the spectral
analysis, we propose a scenario where a photo-ionisation wake (mainly) and an accretion wake (secondarily)
are responsible for the orbital evolution of the absorption column, the continuum emission and
the variability seen at the Fe-line complex.

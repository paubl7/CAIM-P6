The long-standing disparity between the sunspot number record and the Hoyt and Schatten (1998,
H&S) Group Sunspot Number series was initially resolved by the Clette et al. (2014) revision of the
sunspot number and the group number series. The revisions resulted in a flurry of dissenting group
number series while the revised sunspot number series was generally accepted. Thus, the disparity
persisted and confusion reigned, with the choice of solar activity dataset continuing to be a free
parameter. A number of workshops and follow-up collaborative efforts by the community have not
yet brought clarity. We review here several lines of evidence that validate the original revisions
put forward by Clette et al. (2014) and suggest that the perceived conundrum no longer need to delay
acceptance and general use of the revised series. We argue that the solar observations constitute
several distinct populations with different properties which explain the various discontinuities
in the series. This is supported by several proxies: diurnal variation of the geomagnetic field,
geomagnetic signature of the strength of the heliomagnetic field, and variation of radionuclides.
The Waldmeier effect shows that the sunspot number scale has not changed over the last 270 years and
a mistaken scale factor between observers Wolf and Wolfer explains the disparity beginning in 1882
between the sunspot number and the H&S reconstruction of the group number. Observations with replica
of 18th century telescopes (with similar optical flaws) validate the early sunspot number scale;
while a reconstruction of the group number with monthly resolution (with many more degrees of freedom)
validate the size of Solar Cycle 11 given by the revised series that the dissenting series fail to
meet.

Young stellar clusters harbour complex spatial structures emerging from the star formation process.
Identifying stellar over-densities is a key step to constrain better how these structures are formed.
The high accuracy of distances derived from Gaia DR2 parallaxes yet do not allow to locate with certainty
individual stars within clusters of size $\approx 1\, \rm{pc}$. In this work, we explore how such
uncertainty in distance estimates can lead to the misidentification of membership of sub-clusters
selected by the minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm. Our goal is to assess how this impacts their
estimated properties. Using N-body simulations, we build Gravity-Driven Fragmentation (GDF)
models that reproduce self-consistently the early stellar configurations of a star forming region.
Stellar groups are then identified both in 3- and 2-dimensions by the MST algorithm, representing
respectively an ideal and an inaccurate identification. We compare the properties derived of these
resulting groups, to assess the systematic bias introduced by projection and incompleteness.
We show that in such fragmented configurations, the dynamical mass of groups identified in projection
is systematically underestimated compared to those of groups identified in 3D. This systematic
error is statistically of $50\%$ for more than half of the groups and reach $100\%$ in a quarter of
them. Adding incompleteness further increases this bias. These results challenge our ability
to identify accurately sub-clusters in most nearby star forming regions where distance estimate
uncertainties are comparable to the size of the region. New clump finding methods have to tackle
this issue in order to define better the dynamical state of these substructures.

Recent advances in our understanding of the dynamical history of the Solar system have altered the
inferred bombardment history of the Earth during accretion of the Late Veneer, after the Moon-forming
impact. We investigate how the bombardment by planetesimals left-over from the terrestrial planet
region after terrestrial planet formation, as well as asteroids and comets, affects the evolution
of Earth's early atmosphere. We develop a new statistical code of stochastic bombardment for atmosphere
evolution, combining prescriptions for atmosphere loss and volatile delivery derived from hydrodynamic
simulations and theory with results from dynamical modelling of realistic populations of impactors.
We find that for an initially Earth-like atmosphere impacts cause moderate atmospheric erosion
with stochastic delivery of large asteroids giving substantial growth ($\times 10$) in a few $\%$
of cases. The exact change in atmosphere mass is inherently stochastic and dependent on the dynamics
of the left-over planetesimals. We also consider the dependence on unknowns including the impactor
volatile content, finding that the atmosphere is typically completely stripped by especially
dry left-over planetesimals ($<0.02 ~ \%$ volatiles). Remarkably, for a wide range of initial atmosphere
masses and compositions, the atmosphere converges towards similar final masses and compositions,
i.e. initially low mass atmospheres grow whereas massive atmospheres deplete. While the final
properties are sensitive to the assumed impactor properties, the resulting atmosphere mass is
close to that of current Earth. The exception to this is that a large initial atmosphere cannot be
eroded to the current mass unless the atmosphere was initially primordial in composition.

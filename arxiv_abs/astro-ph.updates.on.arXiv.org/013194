In strongly magnetized astrophysical plasma systems, magnetic reconnection is believed to be
a primary process during which explosive energy release and particle acceleration occur, leading
to significant high-energy emission. Past years have witnessed active development of kinetic
modeling of relativistic magnetic reconnection, supporting this magnetically dominated scenario.
A much less explored issue is the consequence of 3D dynamics, where turbulent structures are naturally
generated as various types of instabilities develop. This paper presents a series of 3D, fully-kinetic
simulations of relativistic turbulent magnetic reconnection (RTMR) in positron-electron plasmas
with system domains much larger than kinetic scales. Our simulations start from a force-free current
sheet with several different modes of long wavelength magnetic field perturbations, which drive
additional turbulence in the reconnection region. Because of this, the current layer breaks up
and the reconnection region quickly evolves into a turbulent layer filled with coherent structures
such as flux ropes and current sheets. We find that plasma dynamics in RTMR is vastly different from
their 2D counterparts in many aspects. The flux ropes evolve rapidly after their generation, and
can be completely disrupted due to the secondary kink instability. This turbulent evolution leads
to superdiffusion behavior of magnetic field lines as seen in MHD studies of turbulent reconnection.
Meanwhile, nonthermal particle acceleration and energy-release time scale can be very fast and
do not strongly depend on the turbulence amplitude. The main acceleration mechanism is a Fermi-like
acceleration process supported by the motional electric field, whereas the non-ideal electric
field acceleration plays a subdominant role. We discuss possible observational implications
of 3D RTMR in high-energy astrophysics.

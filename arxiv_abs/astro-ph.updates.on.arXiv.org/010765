The significance of the Ly$\alpha$ emission line as a probe of the high-redshift Universe has long
been established. Originating mainly in the vicinity of young, massive stars and in association
with accretion of large bulks of matter, it is ideal for detecting young galaxies, the fundamental
building blocks of our Universe. Since many different processes shape the spectrum and the spatial
distribution of the Ly$\alpha$ photons in various ways, a multitude of physical properties of galaxies
can be unveiled. However, this also makes the interpretation of Ly$\alpha$ observations notoriously
difficult. Because Ly$\alpha$ is a resonant line, it scatters on neutral hydrogen, having its path
length from the source to our telescopes vastly increased, and taking it through regions of unknown
physical conditions. In this work, a numerical code capable of calculating realistically the radiative
transfer of Ly$\alpha$ is presented. The code is capable of performing the radiative transfer in
an arbitrary and adaptively refined distribution of Ly$\alpha$ source emission, temperature
and velocity field of the interstellar and intergalactic medium, as well as density of neutral and
ionized hydrogen, and, particularly important, dust. Accordingly, it is applied to galaxies simulated
at high resolution, yielding a number of novel and interesting results, most notably the escape
fractions of Ly$\alpha$ photons, the effect of dust on the line profile, and the impact of the transfer
through the intergalactic medium. Furthermore, the remarkable detection of Ly$\alpha$ emission
from a so-called "damped Ly$\alpha$ absorber" -- a special type of objects thought to be the progenitor
of present-day's galaxies -- is presented, and the potential of the code for interpreting observations
is demonstrated.

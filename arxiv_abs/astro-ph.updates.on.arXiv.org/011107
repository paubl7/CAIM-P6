Context. The structure of the wind from the cool giants in symbiotic binaries carries important
information for understanding the wind mass transfer to their white dwarf companions and its fuelling.
Aims. In this paper, we indicate a non-spherical distribution of the neutral wind zone around the
red giant (RG) in the symbiotic binary star, EG And. Methods. We achieved this aim by analysing the
periodic orbital variations of fluxes and radial velocities of individual components of the H$\alpha$
and [OIII]$\lambda$5007 lines observed on our high-cadence medium (R $\sim$ 11 000) and high-resolution
(R $\sim$ 38 000) spectra. Results. The asymmetric shaping of the neutral wind zone at the near-orbital-plane
region is indicated by: (i) the asymmetric course of the H$\alpha$ core emission fluxes along the
orbit; (ii) the presence of their secondary maximum around the orbital phase $\varphi = 0.1$, which
is possibly caused by the refraction effect; and (iii) the properties of the H$\alpha$ broad wing
emission originating by Raman scattering on H$^0$ atoms. The wind is substantially compressed
from polar directions to the orbital plane as constrained by the location of the [OIII]$\lambda$5007
line emission zones in the vicinity of the RG at/around its poles. The corresponding mass-loss rate
from the polar regions of $\lesssim 10 ^{-8}$ Msun/yr is a factor of $\gtrsim 10$ lower than the average
rate of $\approx 10^{-7}$Msun/yr derived from nebular emission of the ionised wind from the RG.
Furthermore, it is two orders of magnitude lower than that measured in the near-orbital-plane region
from Rayleigh scattering. Conclusions. The startling properties of the nebular [OIII]$\lambda$5007
line in EG And provides an independent indication of the wind focusing towards the orbital plane.

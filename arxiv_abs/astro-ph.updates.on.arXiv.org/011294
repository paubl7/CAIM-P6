SPT-CL J2106-5844 is among the most massive galaxy clusters at z>1 yet discovered. While initially
used in cosmological tests to assess the compatibility with $\Lambda$CDM cosmology of such a massive
virialized object at this redshift, more recent studies indicate SPT-CL J2106-5844 is undergoing
a major merger, and is not an isolated system with a singular, well-defined halo. We use sensitive,
high spatial resolution measurements from ALMA and ACA of the thermal SZ effect to reconstruct the
pressure distribution of the intracluster medium in this system. These measurements are coupled
with radio observations from the EMU pilot survey, using ASKAP and the ATCA to search for diffuse
non-thermal emission. Further, to better constrain the thermodynamic structure of the cluster,
we complement our analysis with re-processed archival $Chandra$ observations. We fit the ALMA+ACA
SZ data in $uv$-space using a Bayesian forward modelling technique. The ASKAP and ATCA data are processed
and imaged to specifically highlight any potential diffuse radio emission. In the ALMA+ACA SZ data,
we reliably identify at high significance two main gas components associated with the mass clumps
inferred from weak lensing. Our statistical test excludes at the ~9.9$\sigma$ level the possibility
of describing the system with a single SZ component. While the components had been more difficult
to identify in the X-ray data alone, we find that the bimodal gas distribution is supported by X-ray
hardness distribution. The EMU radio observations reveal a diffuse radio structure ~400 kpc in
projected extent along the north-west/south-east direction, indicative of strong activity from
the active galactic nucleus within the brightest cluster galaxy. Interestingly, albeit on a smaller
scale, a putative optical star-forming filamentary structure detected in the HST image is in an
excellent alignment with the radio structure.

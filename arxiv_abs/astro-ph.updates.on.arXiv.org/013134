The TOPG\"ot project studies a sample of 86 high-mass star-forming regions in different evolutionary
stages from starless cores to ultra compact HII regions. The aim of the survey is to analyze different
molecular species in a statistically significant sample to study the chemical evolution in high-mass
star-forming regions, and identify chemical tracers of the different phases. The sources have
been observed with the IRAM 30m telescope in different spectral windows at 1, 2, and 3 mm. In this first
paper, we present the sample and analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of the TOPG\"ot
sources to derive physical parameters. We use the MADCUBA software to analyze the emission of methyl
cyanide (CH$_3$CN), a well-known tracer of high-mass star formation. The emission of the $\rm{CH_3CN(5_{K}-4_{K})}$
K-transitions has been detected towards 73 sources (85% of the sample), with 12 non-detections
and one source not observed in the frequency range of $\rm{CH_3CN(5_{K}-4_{K})}$. The emission
of CH$_3$CN has been detected towards all evolutionary stages, with the mean abundances showing
a clear increase of an order of magnitude from high-mass starless-cores to later evolutionary stages.
We found a conservative abundance upper limit for high-mass starless cores of $X_{\rm CH_3CN}<4.0\times10^{-11}$,
and a range in abundance of $4.0\times10^{-11}<X_{\rm CH_3CN}<7.0\times10^{-11}$ for those
sources that are likely high-mass starless cores or very early high-mass protostellar objects.
In fact, in this range of abundance we have identified five sources previously not classified as
being in a very early evolutionary stage. The abundance of $\rm{CH_3CN}$ can thus be used to identify
high-mass star-forming regions in early phases of star-formation.

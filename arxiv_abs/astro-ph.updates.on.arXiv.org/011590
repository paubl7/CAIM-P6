The Sari\c{c}i\c{c}ek howardite meteorite shower consisting of 343 documented stones occurred
on 2 September 2015 in Turkey and is the first documented howardite fall. Cosmogenic isotopes show
that Sari\c{c}i\c{c}ek experienced a complex cosmic ray exposure history, exposed during ~12-14
Ma in a regolith near the surface of a parent asteroid, and that an ca.1 m sized meteoroid was launched
by an impact 22 +/- 2 Ma ago to Earth (as did one third of all HED meteorites). SIMS dating of zircon and
baddeleyite yielded 4550.4 +/- 2.5 Ma and 4553 +/- 8.8 Ma crystallization ages for the basaltic magma
clasts. The apatite U-Pb age of 4525 +/- 17 Ma, K-Ar age of ~3.9 Ga, and the U,Th-He ages of 1.8 +/- 0.7
and 2.6 +/- 0.3 Ga are interpreted to represent thermal metamorphic and impact-related resetting
ages, respectively. Petrographic, geochemical and O-, Cr- and Ti- isotopic studies confirm that
Sari\c{c}i\c{c}ek belongs to the normal clan of HED meteorites. Petrographic observations and
analysis of organic material indicate a small portion of carbonaceous chondrite material in the
Sari\c{c}i\c{c}ek regolith and organic contamination of the meteorite after a few days on soil.
Video observations of the fall show an atmospheric entry at 17.3 +/- 0.8 kms-1 from NW, fragmentations
at 37, 33, 31 and 27 km altitude, and provide a pre-atmospheric orbit that is the first dynamical link
between the normal HED meteorite clan and the inner Main Belt. Spectral data indicate the similarity
of Sari\c{c}i\c{c}ek with the Vesta asteroid family spectra, a group of asteroids stretching to
delivery resonances, which includes (4) Vesta. Dynamical modeling of meteoroid delivery to Earth
shows that the disruption of a ca.1 km sized Vesta family asteroid or a ~10 km sized impact crater on
Vesta is required to provide sufficient meteoroids <4 m in size to account for the influx of meteorites
from this HED clan.

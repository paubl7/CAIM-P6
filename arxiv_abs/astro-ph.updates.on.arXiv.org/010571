We quantify the distribution of [OIII]+H$\beta$ line strengths at z$\simeq$7 using a sample of
20 bright (M$_{\mathrm{UV}}$ $\lesssim$ $-$21) galaxies. We select these systems over wide-area
fields (2.3 deg$^2$ total) using a new colour-selection which precisely selects galaxies at z$\simeq$6.63$-$6.83,
a redshift range where blue Spitzer/IRAC [3.6]$-$[4.5] colours unambiguously indicate strong
[OIII]$+$H$\beta$ emission. These 20 galaxies suggest a log-normal [OIII]$+$H$\beta$ EW distribution
with median EW = 759$^{+112}_{-113}$ $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$ and standard deviation = 0.26$^{+0.06}_{-0.05}$
dex. We find no evidence for strong variation in this EW distribution with UV luminosity. The typical
[OIII]+H$\beta$ EW at z$\simeq$7 implied by our sample is considerably larger than that in massive
star forming galaxies at z$\simeq$2, consistent with a shift toward larger average sSFR (4.4 Gyr$^{-1}$)
and lower metallicities (0.16 Z$_\odot$). We also find evidence for the emergence of a population
with yet more extreme nebular emission ([OIII]+H$\beta$ EW$>$1200 $\mathrm{\mathring{A}}$)
that is rarely seen at lower redshifts. These objects have extremely large sSFR ($>$30 Gyr$^{-1}$),
as would be expected for systems undergoing a burst or upturn in star formation. While this may be
a short-lived phase, our results suggest that 20% of the z$\simeq$7 population has such extreme
nebular emission, implying that galaxies likely undergo intense star formation episodes regularly
at z$>$6. We argue that this population may be among the most effective ionizing agents in the reionization
era, both in terms of photon production efficiency and escape fraction. We furthermore suggest
that galaxies passing through this large sSFR phase are likely to be very efficient in forming bound
star clusters.

In physically realistic scalar-field based dynamical dark energy models (including, e.g., quintessence)
one naturally expects the scalar field to couple to the rest of the model's degrees of freedom. In
particular, a coupling to the electromagnetic sector leads to a time (redshift) dependence of the
fine-structure constant and a violation of the Weak Equivalence Principle. Here we extend the previous
Euclid forecast constraints on dark energy models to this enlarged (but physically more realistic)
parameter space, and forecast how well Euclid, together with high-resolution spectroscopic data
and local experiments, can constrain these models. Our analysis combines simulated Euclid data
products with astrophysical measurements of the fine-structure constant, $\alpha$, and local
experimental constraints, and includes both parametric and non-parametric methods. For the astrophysical
measurements of $\alpha$ we consider both the currently available data and a simulated dataset
representative of Extremely Large Telescope measurements and expected to be available in the 2030s.
Our parametric analysis shows that in the latter case the inclusion of astrophysical and local data
improves the Euclid dark energy figure of merit by between $8\%$ and $26\%$, depending on the correct
fiducial model, with the improvements being larger in the null case where the fiducial coupling
to the electromagnetic sector is vanishing. These improvements would be smaller with the current
astrophysical data. Moreover, we illustrate how a genetic algorithms based reconstruction provides
a null test for the presence of the coupling. Our results highlight the importance of complementing
surveys like Euclid with external data products, in order to accurately test the wider parameter
spaces of physically motivated paradigms.

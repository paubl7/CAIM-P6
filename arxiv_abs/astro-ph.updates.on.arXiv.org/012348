Next generation telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) and the Nancy Grace Roman
Space Telescope (NGRST) will enable us to study the first billion years of our Universe in unprecedented
detail. In this work we use the ASTRAEUS (semi-numerical rAdiative tranSfer coupling of galaxy
formaTion and Reionization in N-body dArk mattEr simUlationS) framework, that couples galaxy
formation and reionization (for a wide range of reionization feedback models), to estimate the
cosmic variance expected in the UV Luminosity Function (UV LF) and the Stellar Mass Function (SMF)
in JWST surveys. We find that different reionization scenarios play a minor role in the cosmic variance.
Most of the cosmic variance is completely driven by the underlying density field and increases above
$100\%$ for ${\rm M}_{\rm UV} \sim -17.5 (-20)$ at $z =12 (6)$ for the JADES-deep survey (the deep
JWST Advanced Extragalactic Survey with an area of 46 arcmin$^2$); the cosmic variance decreases
with an increasing survey area roughly independently of redshift. We find that the faint-end (${\rm
M}_{\rm UV} > -17$) slope of the Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) UV LF becomes increasingly shallower
with increasing reionization feedback and show how JWST observations will be able to distinguish
between different models of reionization feedback at $z>9$, even accounting for cosmic variance.
We also show the environments (in terms of density and ionization fields)of Lyman Break Galaxies
during the EoR, finding that the underlying over-density and ionization fraction scale positively
with the UV luminosity. Finally, we also provide a public software tool to allow interested readers
to compute cosmic variance for different redshifts and survey areas.

Large-amplitude longitudinal oscillations (LALOs) in solar prominences have been widely studied
in the last decades. However, their damping and amplification mechanisms are not well understood.
In this study, we investigate the attenuation and amplification of LALOs using high-resolution
numerical simulations with progressively increasing spatial resolutions. We performed time-dependent
numerical simulations of LALOs using the 2D magnetic configuration that contains a dipped region.
After the prominence mass loading in the magnetic dips, we triggered LALOs by perturbing the prominence
mass along the magnetic field. We performed the experiments with four values of spatial resolution.
In the simulations with the highest resolution, the period shows a good agreement with the pendulum
model. The convergence experiment revealed that the damping time saturates at the bottom prominence
region with improving the resolution, indicating the existence of a physical reason for the damping
of oscillations. At the prominence top, the oscillations are amplified during the first minutes
and then are slowly attenuated. The characteristic time suggests more significant amplification
in the experiments with the highest spatial resolution. The analysis revealed that the energy exchange
between the bottom and top prominence regions is responsible for the attenuation and amplification
of LALOs. The high-resolution experiments are crucial for the study of the periods and the damping
mechanism of LALOs. The period agrees with the pendulum model only when using high enough spatial
resolution. The results suggest that numerical diffusion in simulations with insufficient spatial
resolution can hide important physical mechanisms, such as amplification of oscillations.

The formation of the Galactic disc is an enthusiastically debated issue. Numerous studies and models
seek to identify the dominant physical process(es) that shaped its observed properties. Taking
advantage of the improved coverage of the inner Milky Way provided by the SDSS DR16 APOGEE catalogue
and of the ages published in the APOGEE-AstroNN Value Added Catalogue (VAC), we examine the radial
evolution of the chemical and age properties of the Galactic stellar disc, with the aim to better
constrain its formation. Using a sample of 199,307 giant stars with precise APOGEE abundances and
APOGEE-astroNN ages, selected in a +/-2 kpc layer around the galactic plane, we assess the dependency
with guiding radius of: (i) the median metallicity, (ii) the ridge lines of the [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] and
age-[Mg/Fe] distributions and (iii) the Age Distribution Function (ADF). The giant star sample
allows us to probe the radial behaviour of the Galactic disc from Rg = 0 to 14-16 kpc. The thick disc
[Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] ridge lines follow closely grouped parallel paths, supporting the idea that the
thick disc did form from a well-mixed medium. However, the ridge lines present a small drift in [Mg/Fe],
which decreases with increasing guiding radius. At sub-solar metallicity, the intermediate and
outer thin disc [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] ridge lines follow parallel sequences shifted to lower metallicity
as the guiding radius increases. We interpret this pattern, as the signature of a dilution of the
inter-stellar medium from Rg~6 kpc to the outskirt of the disc, which occured before the onset of
the thin disc formation. The APOGEE-AstroNN VAC provides stellar ages for statistically significant
samples of thin disc stars from the Galactic centre up to Rg~14 kpc. An important result provided
by this dataset, is that the thin disc presents evidence of an inside-out formation up to R_g~10-12
kpc.(Abridged)

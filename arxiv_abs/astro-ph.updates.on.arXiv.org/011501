Sub-solar mass black hole binaries, due to their light mass, would have to be primordial in origin
instead of the result of stellar evolution. Soon after formation in the early Universe, primordial
black holes can form binaries after decoupling from the cosmic expansion. Alternatively, primordial
black holes as dark matter could also form binaries in the late Universe due to dynamical encounters
and gravitational-wave braking. A significant feature for this channel is the possibility that
some sources retain non-zero eccentricity in the LIGO/Virgo band. Assuming all dark matter is primordial
black holes with a delta function mass distribution, $1M_\odot-1M_\odot$ binaries formed in this
late Universe channel can be detected by Advanced LIGO and Virgo with at their design sensitivities
with a rate of $\mathcal{O}(1)$/year, where $12\%(3\%)$ events have eccentricity at gravitational-wave
frequency 10 Hz, $e^\mathrm{10Hz}\geq0.01(0.1)$, and non-detection can constrain the binary
formation rate within this model. Third generation detectors would be expected to detect sub-solar
mass eccentric binaries as light as $0.01 M_\odot$ within this channel, if they account for the majority
of the dark matter. Furthermore, we use simulated gravitational-wave data to study the ability
to search for eccentric gravitational-wave signals using quasi-circular waveform template bank
with Advanced LIGO design sensitivity. Assuming binaries with a delta function mass of $0.1(1)M_\odot$
and the eccentricity distribution derived from this late Universe formation channel, for a match-filtering
targeted search, $41\%(6\%)$ of the signals would be missed compared to ideal detection rate due
to the mismatch in the gravitational-wave signal from eccentricity.

Large-scale stellar surveys coupled with recent developments in magneto-hydrodynamical simulations
of the formation of Milky Way-mass galaxies provide an unparalleled opportunity to unveil the physical
processes driving the evolution of the Galaxy. We developed a framework to compare a variety of parameters
with their corresponding predictions from simulations in an unbiased manner, taking into account
the selection function of a stellar survey. We applied this framework to a sample of over 7000 stars
with asteroseismic, spectroscopic, and astrometric data available, together with 6 simulations
from the Auriga project. We found that some simulations are able to produce abundance dichotomies
in the $[{\rm Fe}/{\rm H}]-[\alpha/{\rm Fe}]$ plane which look qualitatively similar to observations.
The peak of their velocity distributions match the observed data reasonably well, however they
predict hotter kinematics in terms of the tails of the distributions and the vertical velocity dispersion.
Assuming our simulation sample is representative of Milky Way-like galaxies, we put upper limits
of 2.21 and 3.70 kpc on radial migration for young ($< 4$ Gyr) and old ($\in [4, 8]$ Gyr) stellar populations
in the solar cylinder. Comparison between the observed and simulated metallicity dispersion as
a function of age further constrains migration to about 1.97 and 2.91 kpc for the young and old populations.
These results demonstrate the power of our technique to compare numerical simulations with high-dimensional
datasets, and paves the way for using the wider field TESS asteroseismic data together with the future
generations of simulations to constrain the subgrid models for turbulence, star formation and
feedback processes.

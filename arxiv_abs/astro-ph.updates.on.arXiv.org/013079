We obtained polarimetric differential imaging of a gas-rich debris disk around HD 141569A with
SPHERE in the H-band to compare the scattering properties of the innermost ring at 44 au with former
observations in total intensity with the same instrument. In polarimetric imaging, we observed
that the intensity of the ring peaks in the south-east, mostly in the forward direction, whereas
in total intensity imaging, the ring is detected only at the south. This noticeable characteristic
suggests a non-uniform dust density in the ring. We implemented a density function varying azimuthally
along the ring and generated synthetic images both in polarimetry and in total intensity, which
are then compared to the actual data. We find that the dust density peaks in the south-west at an azimuthal
angle of $220^{\circ} \sim 238^{\circ}$ with a rather broad width of $61^{\circ} \sim 127^{\circ}$.
Although there are still uncertainties that remain in the determination of the anisotropic scattering
factor, the implementation of an azimuthal density variation to fit the data proved to be robust.
Upon elaborating on the origin of this dust density distribution, we conclude that it could be the
result of a massive collision when we account for the effect of the high gas mass that is present in
the system on the dynamics of grains. Using the outcome of this modelization, we further measured
the polarized scattering phase function for the observed scattering angle between 33$^{\circ}$
and 147$^{\circ}$ as well as the spectral reflectance of the southern part of the ring between 0.98
$\mu$m and 2.1 $\mu$m. We tentatively derived the grain properties by comparing these quantities
with MCFOST models and assuming Mie scattering. Our preliminary interpretation indicates a mixture
of porous sub-micron sized astro-silicate and carbonaceous grains.

The estimation of the polarization $P$ of extragalactic compact sources in Cosmic Microwave Background
images is a very important task in order to clean these images for cosmological purposes -- as, for
example, to constrain the tensor-to-scalar ratio of primordial fluctuations during inflation
-- and also to obtain relevant astrophysical information about the compact sources themselves
in a frequency range, $\nu \sim 10$--$200$ GHz, where observations have only very recently started
to be available. In this paper we propose a Bayesian maximum a posteriori (MAP) approach estimation
scheme which incorporates prior information about the distribution of the polarization fraction
of extragalactic compact sources between 1 and 100 GHz. We apply this Bayesian scheme to white noise
simulations and to more realistic simulations that include CMB intensity, Galactic foregrounds
and instrumental noise with the characteristics of the QUIJOTE experiment Wide Survey at 11 GHz.
Using these simulations, we also compare our Bayesian method with the frequentist Filtered Fusion
method that has been already used in WMAP data and in the \emph{Planck} mission. We find that the Bayesian
method allows us to decrease the threshold for a feasible estimation of $P$ to levels below $\sim
100$ mJy (as compared to $\sim 500$ mJy that was the equivalent threshold for the frequentist Filtered
Fusion). We compare the bias introduced by the Bayesian method and find it to be small in absolute
terms. Finally, we test the robustness of the Bayesian estimator against uncertainties in the prior
and in the flux density of the sources. We find that the Bayesian estimator is robust against moderate
changes in the parameters of the prior and almost insensitive to realistic errors in the estimated
photometry of the sources.

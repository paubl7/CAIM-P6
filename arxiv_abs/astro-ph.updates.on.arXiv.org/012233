Within just two years, two interstellar objects (ISOs) - Oumuamuas and Borisov - have been discovered.
Large quantities of planetesimals form as a by-product of planet formation. Therefore, it seems
likely that ISOs are former planetesimals that became unbound from their parent star. The discoveries
raise the question of the dominant ISO formation process. Here, we concentrate on planetesimals
released during another star's close flybys. We quantify the amount of planetesimals released
during close stellar flybys, their ejection velocity and likely composition. We study the dependence
of the effect of parabolic flybys on the mass ratio between the perturber and parent star, the periastron
distance, inclination, and angle of periastron. Whenever ISOs are produced, they leave their parent
system typically with velocities of 0.5-2 km/s. This ejection velocity is distinctly different
to that of ISOs produced by planet scattering (4-8 km/s) and those shed during the stellar post-main-sequence
phase 0.1-0.2 km/s). Using the typical disc truncation radius in various cluster environments,
we find that clusters like the Orion nebula cluster are likely to produce the equivalent of 0.85 Earth-masses
of ISOs per star. In contrast, clusters like NGC 3603 could produce up to 50 Earth-masses of ISOs per
star. Our solar system probably produced the equivalent of 2-3 Earth masses of ISOs, which left our
solar system at a mean ejection velocity of 0.7 km/s. Most ISOs produced by flybys should be comet-like,
similar to Borisov. ISOs originating from compact long-lived clusters would often show a deficiency
in CO. As soon as a statistically significant sample of ISOs is discovered, the combined information
of their observed velocities and composition might help in constraining the dominant production
process (abridged).

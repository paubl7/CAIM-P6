We study the mean properties of a large representative sample of 217 galaxies showing CIII] emission
at $2<z<4$, selected from a parent sample of $\sim$750 main-sequence star-forming galaxies in
the VANDELS survey. These CIII] emitters have a broad range of UV luminosities, thus allowing a detailed
stacking analysis to characterize their stellar mass, star formation rate (SFR) and stellar metallicity,
as a function of the UV emission line ratios, EWs, and the carbon-to-oxygen (C/O) abundance ratio.
Reliable CIII] detections represent $\sim$30% of the parent sample. Extreme CIII] emitters (EW(CIII])$\gtrsim$8\r{A})
are exceedingly rare ($\sim$3%) in VANDELS. The UV line ratios of the sample suggest no ionization
source other than massive stars. Stacks with larger EW(CIII]) show larger EW(Ly$\alpha$) and lower
metallicity, but not all CIII] emitters are Ly$\alpha$ emitters. The stellar metallicities of
CIII] emitters are not significantly different from that of the parent sample, increasing from
$\sim$10% to $\sim$40% solar for stellar masses $\log$(M$_{\star}$/M$_{\odot})\sim$9-10.5.
The stellar mass-metallicity relation of the CIII] emitters is consistent with previous works
showing strong evolution from $z=0$ to $z\sim3$. The C/O abundances of the sample range 35%-150%
solar, with a noticeable increase with FUV luminosity and a smooth decrease with the CIII] and Ly$\alpha$
EWs. We discuss the CIII] emitters in the C/O-Fe/H and the C/O-O/H planes and find they follow stellar
and nebular abundance trends consistent with those of Milky Way halo and thick disc stars and local
HII galaxies, respectively. A qualitative agreement is also found with chemical evolution models,
which suggests that CIII] emitters at $z\sim$3 are experiencing an active phase of chemical enrichment.

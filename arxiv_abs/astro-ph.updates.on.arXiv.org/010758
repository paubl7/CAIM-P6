Context. FU Orionis is the archetypal FUor star, a subclass of young stellar object (YSO) that undergo
rapid brightening events, often gaining 4-6 magnitudes on timescales of days. This brightening
is often associated with a massive increase in accretion; one of the most ubiquitous processes in
astrophysics from planets and stars to super-massive black holes. We present multi-band interferometric
observations of the FU Ori circumstellar environment, including the first J-band interferometric
observations of a YSO. Aims. We investigate the morphology and temperature gradient of the inner-most
regions of the accretion disk around FU Orionis. We aim to characterise the heating mechanisms of
the disk and comment on potential outburst triggering processes. Methods. Recent upgrades to the
MIRC-X instrument at the CHARA array allowed the first dual-band J and H observations of YSOs.Using
baselines up to 331 m, we present high angular resolution data of a YSO covering the near-infrared
bands J, H, and K. The unprecedented spectral range of the data allows us to apply temperature gradient
models to the innermost regions of FU Ori. Results. We spatially resolve the innermost astronomical
unit of the disk and determine the exponent of the temperature gradient of the inner disk to $T=r^{-0.74\pm0.02}$.
This agrees with theoretical work that predicts $T = r^{-0.75}$ for actively accreting, steady
state disks, a value only obtainable through viscous heating within the disk. We find a disk which
extends down to the stellar surface at $0.015\pm0.007$ au where the temperature is found to be $5800\pm700$
K indicating boundary layer accretion. We find a disk inclined at $32\pm4^\circ$ with a minor-axis
position angle of $34\pm11^\circ$.

Hubble (HST) spectroscopic transit observations of the temperate sub-Neptune K2-18b were interpreted
as the presence of water vapour with potential water clouds. 1D modelling studies also predict the
formation of water clouds at some conditions. However, such models cannot predict the cloud cover,
driven by atmospheric dynamics and thermal contrasts, and thus their real impact on spectra. The
main goal of this study is to understand the formation, distribution and observational consequences
of water clouds on K2-18b and other temperate sub-Neptunes. We simulated the atmospheric dynamics,
water cloud formation and spectra of K2-18b for H2-dominated atmosphere using a 3D GCM. We analysed
the impact of atmospheric composition (with metallicity from 1*solar to 1000*solar), concentration
of cloud condensation nuclei and planetary rotation rate. Assuming that K2-18b has a synchronous
rotation, we show that the atmospheric circulation in the upper atmosphere essentially corresponds
to a symmetric day-to-night circulation. This regime preferentially leads to cloud formation
at the substellar point or at the terminator. Clouds form for metallicity >100*solar with relatively
large particles. For 100-300*solar metallicity, the cloud fraction at the terminators is small
with a limited impact on transit spectra. For 1000*solar metallicity, very thick clouds form at
the terminator. The cloud distribution appears very sensitive to the concentration of CCN and to
the planetary rotation rate. Fitting HST transit data with our simulated spectra suggests a metallicity
of ~100-300*solar. In addition, we found that the cloud fraction at the terminator can be highly
variable, leading to a potential variability in transit spectra. This effect could be common on
cloudy exoplanets and could be detectable with multiple transit observations.

The study of the intensity fluctuation power spectrum of individual supernova remnants (SNRs)
can reveal the structures present at sub-pc scales, and also constrain the physical process that
generates those structures. There are various effects, such as the remnant shell thickness, projection
of a three-dimensional structure onto a two-dimensional observational plane, and the presence
of diffuse "foreground" emission, which causes the observed power spectrum to deviate from the
intrinsic power spectrum of the fluctuations. Here, we report results from a systematic study of
these effects, using direct numerical simulations, in the measured power spectrum. For an input
power-law power spectrum, independent of the power-law index, we see a break in the observed power
law at a scale which depends on the shell thickness of a shell-type SNR, and the three-dimensional
turbulence changes to two-dimensional turbulence beyond that scale. We also report how the estimated
power spectrum is expected to deviate from the intrinsic SNR power spectrum in the presence of additional
diffuse Galactic synchrotron emission (DGSE) around the remnant shell. For a reasonable choice
of the parameters, if the intrinsic SNR power spectrum is shallower than the DGSE power spectrum,
the SNR contribution dominates at small angular scales of the estimated power spectra. On the other
hand, if the SNR power spectrum is relatively steeper, the original power spectra is recovered only
over a small window of angular scales. This study shows how detailed modeling may be used to infer
the true power spectrum from the observed SNR intensity fluctuations power spectrum, which in turn
can be used to constrain the nature of the turbulence that gives rise to these small scale structures.

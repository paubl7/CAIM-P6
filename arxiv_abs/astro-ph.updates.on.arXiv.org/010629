The Milky Way disk exhibits intricate orbit substructure of still-debated dynamical origin. The
phase angles $(\theta_\phi,\theta_R)$---which are conjugates to the actions $(L_z,J_R)$ and
describe a star's location along its orbit---are a powerful diagnostic to identify $m$:$l$ resonances
via the orbit shape relation $\Delta \theta_R / \Delta \theta_\phi = -m/l$. In the past, angle signatures
have been hidden by survey selection effects (SEs). Using test particle simulations of a barred
galaxy, we demonstrate that \emph{Gaia} should allow us to identify the Galactic bar's Outer Lindblad
Resonance (OLR, $l=+1, m=2$) in angle space. We present a simple strategy to mitigate and gauge SEs.
In the angle data of the \emph{Gaia} DR2 RVS sample, we independently identify four candidates for
the OLR and therefore for the pattern speed $\Omega_\text{bar}$. The strongest candidate, $\Omega_\text{bar}\sim1.4\Omega_0$,
positions the OLR above the `Sirius' moving group, agrees with measurements from the Galactic center,
and might be supported by higher-order resonances around the `Hercules/Horn'. But it misses the
classic orbit orientation flip, as discussed in the companion study on actions. The candidate $\Omega_\text{bar}\sim1.2\Omega_0$
was also suggested by the action-based study, has the OLR at the `Hat', is consistent with \emph{slow
bar} models, but still affected by SEs. Weaker candidates are $\Omega_\text{bar}=1.6$ and $1.74\Omega_0$.
In addition, we show that the stellar angles do not support the `Hercules/Horn' being created by
the OLR of a \emph{fast bar}. We conclude that---to resolve if `Sirius' or `Hat' are related to the
bar's OLR---either more complex dynamical explanations and/or more extended data are required.

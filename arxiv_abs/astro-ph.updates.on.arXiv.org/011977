Following a tidal disruption event (TDE), the accretion rate can evolve from quiescent to near-Eddington
levels and back over months - years timescales. This provides a unique opportunity to study the formation
and evolution of the accretion flow around supermassive black holes (SMBHs). We present two years
of multi-wavelength monitoring observations of the TDE AT2018fyk at X-ray, UV, optical and radio
wavelengths. We identify three distinct accretion states and two state transitions between them.
These appear remarkably similar to the behaviour of stellar-mass black holes in outburst. The X-ray
spectral properties show a transition from a soft (thermal-dominated) to a hard (power-law dominated)
spectral state around L$_{\rm bol} \sim $few $ \times 10^{-2}$ L$_{\rm Edd}$, and the strengthening
of the corona over time $\sim$100--200 days after the UV/optical peak. Contemporaneously, the
spectral energy distribution (in particular, the UV-to-X-ray spectral slope $\alpha_{ox}$)
shows a pronounced softening as the outburst progresses. The X-ray timing properties also show
a marked change, initially dominated by variability at long ($>$day) timescales while a high frequency
($\sim$10$^{-3}$ Hz) component emerges after the transition into the hard state. At late times
($\sim$500 days after peak), a second accretion state transition occurs, from the hard into the
quiescent state, as identified by the sudden collapse of the bolometric (X-ray+UV) emission to
levels below 10$^{-3.4}$ L$_{\rm Edd}$. Our findings illustrate that TDEs can be used to study the
scale (in)variance of accretion processes in individual SMBHs. Consequently, they provide a new
avenue to study accretion states over seven orders of magnitude in black hole mass, removing limitations
inherent to commonly used ensemble studies.

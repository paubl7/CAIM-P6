With the discovery of TRAPPIST-1 and its seven planets within 0.06 au, the correct treatment of tidal
interactions is becoming necessary. The eccentricity, rotation, and obliquity of the planets
of TRAPPIST-1 are indeed the result of tidal evolution over the lifetime of the system. Tidal interactions
can also lead to tidal heating in the interior of the planets, which can then be responsible for volcanism
and/or surface deformation. In the majority of studies to estimate the rotation of close-in planets
or their tidal heating, the planets are considered as homogeneous bodies and their rheology is often
taken to be a Maxwell rheology. We investigate here the impact of considering a multi-layer structure
and an Andrade rheology on the way planets dissipate tidal energy as a function of the excitation
frequency. We use an internal structure model, which provides the radial profile of structural
and rheological quantities to compute the tidal response of multi-layer bodies. We then compare
the outcome to the dissipation of a homogeneous planet. We find that for purely rocky bodies, it is
possible to approximate the response of a multi-layer planet by that of a homogeneous planet. However,
using average profiles of shear modulus and viscosity to compute the homogeneous planet response
leads to an overestimation of the averaged dissipation. We provide fitted values of shear modulus
and viscosity to be able to reproduce the response of various types of rocky planets. However, we
find that if the planet has an icy layer, its tidal response can no longer be approximated by a homogeneous
body because of the very different properties of the icy layers, which lead to a second dissipation
peak at higher frequencies. We also compute the tidal heating profiles for the outer TRAPPIST-1
planets (e to h).

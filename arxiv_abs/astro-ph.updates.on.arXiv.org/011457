We present MeerKAT neutral hydrogen (HI) observations of the Fornax A group, that is likely falling
into the Fornax cluster for the first time. Our HI image is sensitive to 1.4 x 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$
over 44.1 km s$^{-1}$, where we detect HI in 10 galaxies and a total of 1.12 x 10$^{9}$ Msol of HI in the
intra-group medium (IGM). We search for signs of pre-processing in the 12 group galaxies with confirmed
optical redshifts that reside within our HI image. There are 9 galaxies that show evidence of pre-processing
and we classify the pre-processing status of each galaxy, according to their HI morphology and gas
(atomic and molecular) scaling relations. Galaxies yet to experience pre-processing have extended
HI disks, a high HI content with a H$_2$-to-HI ratio an order of magnitude lower than the median for
their stellar mass. Galaxies currently being pre-processed display HI tails, truncated HI disks
with typical gas ratios. Galaxies in the advanced stages of pre-processing are HI deficient. If
there is any HI, they have lost their outer HI disk and efficiently converted their HI to H$_2$, resulting
in H$_2$-to-HI ratios an order of magnitude higher than the median for their stellar mass. The central,
massive galaxy in our group underwent a 10:1 merger 2 Gyr ago, and ejected 6.6 - 11.2 x 10$^{8}$ Msol
of HI that we detect as clouds and streams in the IGM, some forming coherent structures up to 220 kpc
in length. We also detect giant (100 kpc) ionised hydrogen (H$\alpha$) filaments in the IGM, likely
from cool gas being removed (and ionised) from an infalling satellite. The H$\alpha$ filaments
are situated within the hot halo of NGC 1316 and some regions contain HI. We speculate that the H$\alpha$
and multiphase gas is supported by magnetic pressure (possibly assisted by the AGN), such that the
hot gas can condense and form HI that survives in the hot halo for cosmological timescales.

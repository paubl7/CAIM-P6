We study the near-infrared (NIR) scattering in LDN 1642, its correlation with the cloud structure,
and the ability of dust models to simultaneously explain sub-millimetre emission, NIR extinction,
and NIR scattering. We use observations from the HAWK-I instrument to measure the NIR surface brightness
and extinction. These are compared with Herschel data on dust emission and, with radiative transfer
modelling, with predictions calculated for different dust models. We find an optical depth ratio
$\tau(250\,\mu{\rm m})/\tau(J)\approx 10^{-3}$, confirming earlier findings of high sub-millimetre
emissivity. The relationships between the column density derived from dust emission and the NIR
colour excesses is linear and consistent with the standard NIR extinction curve. The extinction
peaks at $A_J=2.6\,$mag, the NIR surface brightness remaining correlated with $N({\rm H}_2)$
without saturation. Radiative transfer models can fit the sub-millimetre data with any of the tested
dust models. However, these predict a NIR extinction that is higher and a NIR surface brightness
that is lower than in observations. If the dust sub-millimetre emissivity is rescaled to the observed
value of $\tau(250\,\mu{\rm m})/\tau(J)$, dust models with high NIR albedo can reach the observed
level of NIR surface brightness. The NIR extinction of the models tends to be higher than directly
measured, which is reflected in the shape of the NIR surface brightness spectra. The combination
of emission, extinction, and scattering measurements provides strong constraints on dust models.
The observations of LDN 1642 indicate clear dust evolution, including a strong increase in the sub-millimetre
emissivity, not yet fully explained by the current dust models.

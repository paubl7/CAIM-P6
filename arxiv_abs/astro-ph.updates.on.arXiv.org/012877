The narrow-line region (NLR) consists of gas clouds ionized by the strong radiation from the active
galactic nucleus (AGN), distributed in the spatial scale of AGN host galaxies. The strong emission
lines from the NLR are useful to diagnose physical and chemical properties of the interstellar medium
in AGN host galaxies. However, the origin of the NLR is unclear; the gas clouds in NLRs may be originally
in the host and photoionized by the AGN radiation, or they may be transferred from the nucleus with
AGN-driven outflows. For studying the origin of the NLR, we systematically investigate the gas
density and velocity dispersion of NLR gas clouds using a large spectroscopic data set taken from
the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The [S II] emission-line flux ratio and [O III] velocity width of 9,571
type-2 Seyfert galaxies and 110,041 star-forming galaxies suggest that the gas density and velocity
dispersion of NLR clouds in Seyfert galaxies (ne ~ 194 cm-3 and sigma([O III]) ~ 147 km s-1) are systematically
larger than those of clouds in H II regions of star-forming galaxies (ne ~ 29 cm-3 and sigma([O III])
~ 58 km s-1). Interestingly, the electron density and velocity dispersion of NLR gas clouds are larger
for Seyfert galaxies with a higher [O III]/Hbeta flux ratio, i.e., with a more active AGN. We also
investigate the spatially-resolved kinematics of ionized gas clouds using the Mapping Nearby
Galaxies at the Apache Point Observatory (MaNGA) survey data for 90 Seyfert galaxies and 801 star-forming
galaxies. We find that the velocity dispersion of NLR gas clouds in Seyfert galaxies is larger than
that in star-forming galaxies at a fixed stellar mass, at both central and off-central regions.
These results suggest that gas clouds in NLRs come from the nucleus, probably through AGN outflows.

Quasar-driven outflows must have made their most significant impact on galaxy formation during
the epoch when massive galaxies were forming most rapidly. To study the impact of quasar feedback
we conducted rest-frame optical integral field spectrograph (IFS) observations of three extremely
red quasars (ERQs) and one type-2 quasar at $z=2-3$, obtained with the NIFS and OSIRIS instruments
at the Gemini North and W. M. Keck Observatory with the assistance of laser-guided adaptive optics.
We use the kinematics and morphologies of the [OIII] 5007\AA\ and H$\alpha$ 6563\AA\ emission lines
redshifted into the near-infrared to gauge the extents, kinetic energies and momentum fluxes of
the ionized outflows in the quasars host galaxies. For the ERQs, the galactic-scale outflows are
likely driven by radiation pressure in a high column density environment or due to an adiabatic shock.
For the type-2 quasar, the outflow is driven by radiation pressure in a low column density environment
or due to a radiative shock. The outflows in the ERQs carry a significant amount of energy ranging
from 0.05-5$\%$ of the quasar's bolometric luminosity, powerful enough to have a significant impact
on the quasar host galaxies. However, the outflows are likely only impacting the inner few kpc of
each host galaxy. The observed outflow sizes are generally smaller than other ionized outflows
observed at high redshift. The high ratio between the momentum flux of the ionized outflow and the
photon momentum flux from the quasar accretion disk and high nuclear obscuration makes these ERQs
great candidates for transitional objects where the outflows are likely responsible for clearing
material in the inner regions of each galaxy, unveiling the quasar accretion disk at optical wavelengths.

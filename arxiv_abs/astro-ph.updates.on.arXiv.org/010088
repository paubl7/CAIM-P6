Measuring isotopic ratios is a sensitive technique used to obtain information on stellar nucleosynthesis
and chemical evolution. We present measurements of the carbon and sulphur abundances in the interstellar
medium of the central region of our Galaxy. The selected targets are the +50km/s Cloud and several
l.o.s. clouds towards Sgr B2(N). Towards the +50km/s Cloud, we observed the J=2-1 rotational transitions
of CS, C34S, 13CS, C33S, and 13C34S, and the J=3-2 transitions of CS and C34S with the IRAM-30m telescope,
as well as the J=6-5 transitions of C34S and 13CS with the APEX 12m telescope, all in emission. The
J=2-1 rotational transitions of CS, C34S, 13CS, and 13C34S were observed with ALMA in the envelope
of Sgr B2(N), with those of CS and C34S also observed in the l.o.s. clouds towards Sgr B2(N), all in
absorption. In the +50km/s Cloud we derive a 12C13C isotopic ratio of ~22.1, that leads, with the
measured 13CS/C34S line intensity ratio, to a 32S/34S ratio of 16.3+3.0-2.4. We also derive the
32S/34S isotopic ratio more directly from the two isotopologues 13CS and 13C34S, which leads to
an independent 32S/34S estimation of 16.3+2.1-1.7 and 17.9+-5.0 for the +50km/s Cloud and Sgr B2(N),
respectively. We also obtain a 34S/33S ratio of ~4.3 in the +50 km/s Cloud. Previous studies observed
a decreasing trend in the 32S/34S isotopic ratios when approaching the Galactic centre. Our result
indicates a termination of this tendency at least at a galactocentric distance of 130-30+60 pc.
This is at variance with findings based on 12C/13C, 14N/15N and 18O/17O isotope ratios, where the
above-mentioned trend is observed to continue right to the central molecular zone. This can indicate
a drop in the production of massive stars at the Galactic centre, in the same line as recent metallicity
gradient studies, and opens the work towards a comparison with Galactic and stellar evolution models.

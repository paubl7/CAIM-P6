Context:In 2020 May-June, six solar energetic ion events were observed by the Parker Solar Probe/ISoIS
instrument suite at 0.35 AU from the Sun. From standard velocity-dispersion analysis, the apparent
ion path length is 0.625 AU at the onset of each event. Aims:We develop a formalism for estimating
the path length of random-walking magnetic field lines, to explain why the apparent ion pathlength
at event onset greatly exceeds the radial distance from the Sun for these events. Methods:We developed
analytical estimates of the average increase in pathlength of random-walking magnetic field lines,
relative to the unperturbed mean field. Monte Carlo simulations of fieldline and particle trajectories
in a model of solar wind turbulence are used to validate the formalism and study the path lengths of
particle guiding-center and full-orbital trajectories. The formalism is implemented in a global
solar wind model, and results are compared with ion pathlengths inferred from ISoIS observations.
Results:Both a simple estimate and a rigorous theoretical formulation are obtained for fieldlines'
pathlength increase as a function of pathlength along the large-scale field. From simulated fieldline
and particle trajectories, we find that particle guiding centers can have pathlengths somewhat
shorter than the average fieldline pathlength, while particle orbits can have substantially larger
pathlengths due to their gyromotion with a nonzero effective pitch angle. Conclusions:The long
apparent path length during these solar energetic ion events can be explained by 1) a magnetic field
line path length increase due to the field line random walk, and 2) particle transport about the guiding
center with a nonzero effective pitch angle. Our formalism for computing the magnetic field line
path length, accounting for turbulent fluctuations, may be useful for application to solar particle
transport in general.

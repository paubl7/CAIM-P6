We report photometric estimates of effective temperature, $T_{\rm eff}$, metallicity, [Fe/H],
carbonicity, [C/Fe], and absolute carbon abundances, $A{\rm (C)}$, for over 700,000 stars from
the Southern Photometric Local Universe Survey (S-PLUS) Data Release 2, covering a substantial
fraction of the equatorial Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82. We present an analysis for two stellar
populations: 1) halo main-sequence turnoff stars and 2) K-dwarf stars of mass $0.58 < M/M_{\odot}
<0.75$ in the Solar Neighborhood. Application of the Stellar Photometric Index Network Explorer
(SPHINX) to the mixed-bandwidth (narrow- plus wide-band) filter photometry from S-PLUS produces
robust estimates of the metallicities and carbon abundances in stellar atmospheres over a wide
range of temperature, $4250 < T_{\rm eff} \textrm{(K)} < 7000$. The use of multiple narrow-band
S-PLUS filters enables SPHINX to achieve substantially lower levels of "catastrophic failures"
(large offsets in metallicity estimates relative to spectroscopic determinations) than previous
efforts using a single metallicity-sensitive narrow-band filter. We constrain the exponential
slope of the Milky Way's K-dwarf halo metallicity distribution function (MDF), $\lambda_{10,
\textrm{[Fe/H]}} = 0.85 \pm 0.21$, over the metallicity range $-2.5 < \textrm{[Fe/H]} < -1.0$;
the MDF of our local-volume K-dwarf sample is well-represented by a gamma distribution with parameters
$\alpha=2.8$ and $\beta=4.2$. S-PLUS photometry obtains absolute carbon abundances with a precision
of $\sim 0.35$dex for stars with $T_{\rm eff} < 6500$K. We identify 364 candidate carbon-enhanced
metal-poor stars, obtain assignments of these stars into the Yoon-Beers morphological groups
in the $A$(C)-[Fe/H] space, and derive the CEMP frequencies.

While most purpose-built 21cm intensity mapping experiments are close-packed interferometer
arrays, general-purpose dish arrays should also be capable of measuring the cosmological 21cm
signal. This can be achieved most efficiently if the array is used as a collection of scanning autocorrelation
dishes rather than as an interferometer. As a first step towards demonstrating the feasibility
of this observing strategy, we show that we are able to successfully calibrate dual-polarisation
autocorrelation data from 64 MeerKAT dishes in the L-band (856-1712 MHz, 4096 channels), with 10.5
hours of data retained from six nights of observing. We describe our calibration pipeline, which
is based on multi-level RFI flagging, periodic noise diode injection to stabilise gain drifts and
an absolute calibration based on a multi-component sky model. We show that it is sufficiently accurate
to recover maps of diffuse celestial emission and point sources over a 10 deg x 30 deg patch of the sky
overlapping with the WiggleZ 11hr field. The reconstructed maps have a good level of consistency
between per-dish maps and external datasets, with the estimated thermal noise limited to 1.4 x the
theoretical noise level (~ 2 mK). The residual maps have rms amplitudes below 0.1 K, corresponding
to <1% of the model temperature. The reconstructed Galactic HI intensity map shows excellent agreement
with the Effelsberg-Bonn HI Survey, and the flux of the radio galaxy 4C+03.18 is recovered to within
3.6%, which demonstrates that the autocorrelation can be successfully calibrated to give the zero-spacing
flux and potentially help in the imaging of MeerKAT interferometric data. Our results provide a
positive indication towards the feasibility of using MeerKAT and the future SKA to measure the HI
intensity mapping signal and probe cosmology on degree scales and above.

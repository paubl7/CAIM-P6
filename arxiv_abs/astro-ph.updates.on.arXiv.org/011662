Scalar-field dark matter (SFDM) halos exhibit a core-envelope structure with soliton-like cores
and CDM-like envelopes. Simulations without self-interaction (free-field case) report a core-halo
mass relation $M_c\propto M_{h}^{\beta}$, with either $\beta=1/3$ or $\beta=5/9$, which can
be understood if core and halo obey certain energy or velocity scalings. We extend the core-halo
mass relations to include SFDM with self-interaction (SI), either repulsive or attractive, and
investigate its implications for the gravitational instability and collapse of solitonic cores,
leading to supermassive black hole (SMBH) formation. For SFDM parameters that make $\sim$ Kpc-sized
cores and CDM-like structure formation on large scales but suppressed on small scales, cores are
stable for all galactic halos of interest, from the free-field to the repulsive SI limit. For attractive
SI, however, halos masses $M_h\sim (10^{10}-10^{12}) M_\odot$ have cores that collapse to SMBHs
with $M_{SMBH}\sim 10^{6}-10^8 M_\odot$, as observations seem to require, while smaller-mass
halos have stable cores, for particle masses $m\simeq (2.14\times 10^{-22}-9.9\times 10^{-20})\rm{eV}/c^2$,
if the free-field has $\beta=1/3$, or $m = 2.23\times 10^{-21}-1.7\times 10^{-18}\rm{eV}/c^2$,
if $\beta=5/9$. For free-field and repulsive cases, however, if previous constraints on particle
parameters are relaxed to allow much smaller (sub-galactic scale) cores, then halos can also form
SMBHs, for the same range of halo and BH masses, as long as $\beta = 5/9$ is correct for the free-field.
In that case, structure formation in SFDM would be largely indistinguishable from Cold Dark Matter
(CDM). Such SFDM models might not resolve the small-scale structure problems of CDM, but they would
explain the formation of SMBHs quite naturally. Since CDM, itself, has not yet been ruled out, such
SFDM models must also be viable (Abbreviated).

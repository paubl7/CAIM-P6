It has been recently shown from observational data sets the variation of structural parameters
and internal dynamical evolution of star clusters in the Milky Way and in the Large Magellanic Cloud
(LMC), caused by the different gravitational field strengths that they experience. We report here
some hints for such a differential tidal effects in structural parameters of star clusters in the
Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), which is nearly 10 times less massive than the LMC. A key contribution
to this study is the consideration of the SMC as a triaxial spheroid, from which we estimate the deprojected
distances to the SMC center of the statistically significant sample of star clusters analyzed.
By adopting a 3D geometry of the SMC, we avoid the spurious effects caused by considering that a star
cluster observed along the line-of-sight is close to the galaxy center. When inspecting the relationships
between the star cluster sizes (represented by the 90% light radii), their eccentricities, masses
and ages with the deprojected distances, we find: (i) the star cluster sizes are not visibly affected
by tidal effects, because relatively small and large objects are spread through the SMC body. (ii)
Star clusters with large eccentricities (> 0.4) are preferentially found located at deprojected
distances smaller than $\sim$ 7-8 kpc, although many star clusters with smaller eccentricities
are also found occupying a similar volume. (iii) Star clusters more massive than log(M /Mo) $\sim$
4.0 are among the oldest star clusters, generally placed in the outermost SMC region and with a relative
small level of flattening. These findings contrast with the more elongated, generally younger,
less massive and innermost star clusters.

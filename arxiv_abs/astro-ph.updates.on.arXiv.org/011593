Besides the spirals induced by the Lindblad resonances, planets can generate a family of tightly
wound spirals through buoyancy resonances. The excitation of buoyancy resonances depends on the
thermal relaxation timescale of the gas. By computing timescales of various processes associated
with thermal relaxation, namely, radiation, diffusion, and gas-dust collision, we show that the
thermal relaxation in protoplanetary disks' surface layers ($Z/R\gtrsim0.1$) and outer disks
($R\gtrsim100$ au) is limited by infrequent gas-dust collisions. The use of isothermal equation
of state or rapid cooling, common in protoplanetary disk simulations, is therefore not justified.
Using three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we show that the collision-limited slow thermal
relaxation provides favorable conditions for buoyancy resonances to develop. Buoyancy resonances
produce predominantly vertical motions, whose magnitude at the $^{12}$CO emission surface is
of order of $100~{\rm m~s}^{-1}$ for Jovian-mass planets, sufficiently large to detect using molecular
line observations with ALMA. We generate synthetic observations and describe characteristic
features of buoyancy resonances in Keplerian-subtracted moment maps and velocity channel maps.
Based on the morphology and magnitude of the perturbation, we propose that the tightly wound spirals
observed in TW Hya could be driven by a (sub-)Jovian-mass planet at 90 au. We discuss how non-Keplerian
motions driven by buoyancy resonances can be distinguished from those driven by other origins.
We argue that observations of multiple lines tracing different heights, with sufficiently high
spatial/spectral resolution and sensitivity to separate the emission arising from the near and
far sides of the disk, will help constrain the origin of non-Keplerian motions.

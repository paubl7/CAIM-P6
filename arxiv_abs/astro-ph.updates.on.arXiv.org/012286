[Abridged] The study of disc kinematics has recently opened up as a promising method to detect unseen
planets. However, a systematic, statistically meaningful analysis of such an approach remains
missing. The aim of this work is to devise an automated, statistically robust technique to identify
kinematical perturbations induced by the presence of planets in a gas disc, and to accurately infer
their location. For this purpose, we produce hydro simulations of planet-disc interactions with
different planet masses, 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 $M_{Jup}$, at a radius of $R=100$ au in the disc, and perform
radiative transfer calculations of CO to simulate observables for 13 planet azimuths. Using the
DISCMINER package, we fit the synthetic data cubes with a Keplerian model of the channel-by-channel
emission to study line profile differences, including deviations from Keplerian rotation. The
detection technique, based on line centroid differences, captures localised planet-driven perturbations,
and can distinguish them from axisymmetric velocity perturbations. The method can detect all three
simulated planets, at all azimuths, with an average accuracy of $\pm3^\circ$ in azimuth and $\pm8$
au in radius. Owing to disc structure and line-of-sight projection effects, planets at azimuths
close to $\pm45^\circ$ yield the highest velocity fluctuations, whereas those at limiting cases,
$0^\circ$ and $\pm90^\circ$, drive the lowest. The observed peak velocities range within 40$-$70,
70$-$170 and 130$-$450 m s$^{-1}$ for 0.3, 1.0 and 3.0 $M_{Jup}$ planets. Our analysis indicates
that the variance of peak velocities is boosted near planets due to organised gas motions prompted
by their localised gravitational well. We propose an approach that exploits this velocity coherence
to provide, for the first time, statistically significant detections of localised planet-driven
perturbations in the gas disc kinematics.

The projected density distribution of type ab RR Lyrae (RRab) stars was characterised from the innermost
regions of the Milky Way to the halo, with the aim of placing constraints on the Galaxys evolution.
The compiled sample (N_RRab = 64,850) stems from fundamental mode RR Lyrae variables identified
by the VVV, OGLE, and Gaia surveys. The distribution is well fitted by three power laws over three
radial intervals. In the innermost region (R < 2.2 deg) the distribution follows Sigma_RRab[1]
propto R ^(-0.94 +- 0.051), while in the external region the distribution adheres to Sigma_RRab[2]
propto R^(-1.50 +- 0.019) for 2.2 deg< R <8.0 deg and Sigma_RRab[3] propto R ^(-2.43 +- 0.043) for
8.0 deg < R <30.0 deg. Conversely, the cumulative distribution of red clump (RC) giants exhibits
a more concentrated distribution in the mean, but in the central R < 2.2 deg the RRab population is
more peaked, whereas globular clusters (GCs) follow a density power law (Sigma_GCs propto R ^(-1.59
+- 0.060) for R<30.0 deg) similar to that of RRab stars, especially when considering a more metal-poor
subsample ([Fe/H]<-1.1 dex). The main conclusion emerging from the analysis is that the RRab distribution
favours the star cluster infall and merger scenario for creating an important fraction (>18 %) of
the central Galactic region. The radii containing half of the populations (half populations radii)
are R_H=6.8 deg (0.99 kpc), R_H =4.2 deg (0.61 kpc), and R_H =11.9 deg (1.75 kpc) for the RRab stars,
RC giants, and GCs, respectively. Finally, merely 1% of the stars have been actually discovered
in the innermost region (R < 35 pc) out of the expected (based on our considerations) total number
of RRab therein: N sim 1,562. That deficit will be substantially ameliorated with future space missions
like the Nancy Grace Roman Space Telescope (formerly WFIRST).

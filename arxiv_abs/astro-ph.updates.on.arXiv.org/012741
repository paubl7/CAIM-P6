Relativistic jets launched by rotating black holes are powerful emitters of non-thermal radiation.
Extraction of the rotational energy via electromagnetic stresses produces magnetically-dominated
jets, which may become turbulent. Studies of magnetically-dominated plasma turbulence from first
principles show that most of the accelerated particles have small pitch angles, i.e. the particle
velocity is nearly aligned with the local magnetic field. We examine synchrotron-self-Compton
radiation from anisotropic particles in the fast cooling regime. The small pitch angles reduce
the synchrotron cooling rate and promote the role of inverse Compton (IC) cooling, which can occur
in two different regimes. In the Thomson regime, both synchrotron and IC components have soft spectra,
$\nu F_\nu\propto\nu^{1/2}$. In the Klein-Nishina regime, synchrotron radiation has a hard spectrum,
typically $\nu F_\nu\propto\nu$, over a broad range of frequencies. Our results have implications
for the modelling of BL Lacs and Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). BL Lacs produce soft synchrotron and IC
spectra, as expected when Klein-Nishina effects are minor. The observed synchrotron and IC luminosities
are typically comparable, which indicates a moderate anisotropy with pitch angles $\theta\gtrsim0.1$.
Rare orphan gamma-ray flares may be produced when $\theta\ll0.1$. The hard spectra of GRBs may be
consistent with synchrotron radiation when the emitting particles are IC cooling in the Klein-Nishina
regime, as expected for pitch angles $\theta\sim0.1$. Blazar and GRB spectra can be explained by
turbulent jets with a similar electron plasma magnetisation parameter, $\sigma_{\rm e}\sim10^4$,
which for electron-proton plasmas corresponds to an overall magnetisation $\sigma=(m_{\rm e}/m_{\rm
p})\sigma_{\rm e}\sim10$.

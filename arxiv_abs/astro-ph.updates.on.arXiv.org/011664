With the advent of next-generation surveys and the expectation of discovering huge numbers of strong
gravitational lens systems, much effort is being invested into developing automated procedures
for handling the data. The several orders of magnitude increase in the number of strong galaxy-galaxy
lens systems is an insurmountable challenge for traditional modelling techniques. Whilst machine
learning techniques have dramatically improved the efficiency of lens modelling, parametric
modelling of the lens mass profile remains an important tool for dealing with complex lensing systems.
In particular, source reconstruction methods are necessary to cope with the irregular structure
of high-redshift sources. In this paper, we consider a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) that
analyses the outputs of semi-analytic methods which parametrically model the lens mass and linearly
reconstruct the source surface brightness distribution. We show the unphysical source reconstructions
that arise as a result of incorrectly initialised lens models can be effectively caught by our CNN.
Furthermore, the CNN predictions can be used to automatically re-initialise the parametric lens
model, avoiding unphysical source reconstructions. The CNN, trained on reconstructions of lensed
S\'ersic sources, accurately classifies source reconstructions of the same type with a precision
$P > 0.99$ and recall $R > 0.99$. The same CNN, without re-training, achieves $P=0.89$ and $R=0.89$
when classifying source reconstructions of more complex lensed HUDF sources. Using the CNN predictions
to re-initialise the lens modelling procedure, we achieve a 69 per cent decrease in the occurrence
of unphysical source reconstructions. This combined CNN and parametric modelling approach can
greatly improve the automation of lens modelling.

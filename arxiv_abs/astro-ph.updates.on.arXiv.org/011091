Determining the effective temperatures (Teff) of red supergiants (RSGs) observationally is important
in many fields of stellar physics and galactic astronomy, yet some significant difficulties remain
due to model uncertainty originating majorly in the extended atmosphere of RSGs. Here we propose
the line-depth ratio (LDR) method in which we use only Fe I lines. As opposed to the conventional LDR
method with lines of multiple species involved, the LDR of this kind is insensitive to the surface
gravity effects and expected to circumvent the uncertainty originating in the upper atmosphere
of RSGs. Therefore, the LDR--Teff relations that we calibrated empirically with red giants may
be directly applied to RSGs, though various differences, e.g., caused by the three-dimensional
non-LTE effects, between the two groups of objects need to be kept in mind. Using the near-infrared
YJ-band spectra of nine well-known solar-metal red giants observed with the WINERED high-resolution
spectrograph, we selected 12 pairs of Fe I lines least contaminated with other lines. Applying their
LDR--Teff relations to ten nearby RSGs, the resultant Teff with the internal precision of 30--70
K shows good agreement with previous observational results assuming one-dimensional LTE and with
Geneva's stellar evolution model. We found no evidence of significant systematic bias caused by
various differences, including those in the size of the non-LTE effects, between red giants and
RSGs except for one line pair which we rejected because the non-LTE effects may be as large as ~250
K. Nevertheless, it is difficult to evaluate the systematic bias, and further study is required,
e.g., with including the three-dimensional non-LTE calculations of all the lines involved.

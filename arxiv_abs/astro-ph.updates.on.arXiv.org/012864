The investigation of the wind in the solar corona initiated with the observations of the resonantly
scattered UV emission of the coronal plasma obtained with UVCS-SOHO, designed to measure the wind
outflow speed by applying the Doppler dimming diagnostics. Metis on Solar Orbiter complements
the UVCS spectroscopic observations, performed during solar activity cycle 23, by simultaneously
imaging the polarized visible light and the HI Ly-alpha corona in order to obtain high-spatial and
temporal resolution maps of the outward velocity of the continuously expanding solar atmosphere.
The Metis observations, on May 15, 2020, provide the first HI Ly-alpha images of the extended corona
and the first instantaneous map of the speed of the coronal plasma outflows during the minimum of
solar activity and allow us to identify the layer where the slow wind flow is observed. The polarized
visible light (580-640 nm), and the UV HI Ly-alpha (121.6 nm) coronal emissions, obtained with the
two Metis channels, are combined in order to measure the dimming of the UV emission relative to a static
corona. This effect is caused by the outward motion of the coronal plasma along the direction of incidence
of the chromospheric photons on the coronal neutral hydrogen. The plasma outflow velocity is then
derived as a function of the measured Doppler dimming. The static corona UV emission is simulated
on the basis of the plasma electron density inferred from the polarized visible light. This study
leads to the identification, in the velocity maps of the solar corona, of the high-density layer
about +/-10 deg wide, centered on the extension of a quiet equatorial streamer present at the East
limb where the slowest wind flows at about (160 +/- 18) km/s from 4 Rs to 6 Rs. Beyond the boundaries
of the high-density layer, the wind velocity rapidly increases, marking the transition between
slow and fast wind in the corona.

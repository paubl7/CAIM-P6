Photometric monitoring of Beta Pictoris in 1981 showed anomalous fluctuations of up to 4% over several
days, consistent with foreground material transiting the stellar disk. The subsequent discovery
of the gas giant planet Beta Pictoris b and the predicted transit of its Hill sphere to within 0.1 au
projected distance of the planet provided an opportunity to search for the transit of a circumplanetary
disk in this $21\pm 4$ Myr-old planetary system. Continuous broadband photometric monitoring
of Beta Pictoris requires ground-based observatories at multiple longitudes to provide redundancy
and to provide triggers for rapid spectroscopic followup. These observatories include the dedicated
Beta Pictoris monitoring observatory bRing at Sutherland and Siding Springs, the ASTEP400 telescope
at Concordia, and observations from the space observatories BRITE and Hubble Space Telescope.
We search the combined light curves for evidence of short period transient events caused by rings
and for longer term photometric variability due to diffuse circumplanetary material. We find no
photometric event that matches with the event seen in November 1981, and there is no systematic photometric
dimming of the star as a function of the Hill sphere radius. We conclude that the 1981 event was not
caused by the transit of a circumplanetary disk around Beta Pictoris b. The upper limit on the long
term variability of Beta Pictoris places an upper limit of $1.8\times 10^{22}$ g of dust within the
Hill sphere. Circumplanetary material is either condensed into a non-transiting disk, is condensed
into a disk with moons that has a small obliquity, or is below our detection threshold. This is the
first time that a dedicated international campaign has mapped the Hill sphere transit of a gas giant
extrasolar planet at 10 au.

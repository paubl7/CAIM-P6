Stellar systems are often formed through the collapse of dense molecular clouds which, in turn,
return copious amounts of atomic and molecular material to the interstellar medium. An in-depth
understanding of chemical evolution during this cyclic interaction between the stars and the interstellar
medium is at the heart of astrochemistry. Systematic chemical composition changes as interstellar
clouds evolve from the diffuse stage to dense, quiescent molecular clouds to star-forming regions
and proto-planetary disks further enrich the molecular diversity leading to the evolution of ever
more complex molecules. In particular, the icy mantles formed on interstellar dust grains and their
irradiation are thought to be the origin of many of the observed molecules, including those that
are deemed to be prebiotic; that is those molecules necessary for the origin of life. This review
will discuss both observational (e.g., ALMA, SOFIA, Herschel) and laboratory investigations
using millimeter, submillimeter, and terahertz and far-IR (THz/F-IR) spectroscopies and the
role that they play in contributing to our understanding of the formation of prebiotic molecules.
Mid-IR spectroscopy has typically been the primary tool used in laboratory studies. However, THz/F-IR
spectroscopy offers an additional and complementary approach in that it provides the ability to
investigate intermolecular interactions compared to the intramolecular modes available in the
mid-IR. THz/F-IR spectroscopy is still somewhat under-utilized, but with the additional capability
it brings, its popularity is likely to significantly increase in the near future. This review will
discuss the strengths and limitations of such methods, and will also provide some suggestions on
future research areas that should be pursued in the coming decade exploiting both space-borne and
laboratory facilities.

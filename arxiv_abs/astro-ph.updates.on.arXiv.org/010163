The reflectance of a particulate surface depends on the phase angle at which it is observed. This
is true for laboratory measurements on powders of natural materials as well as remote observations
of Solar System surfaces. Here, we measured the dependences of reflectance spectra with phase angles,
of a suite of 72 meteorites in the 400-2600 nm range. The 10-30{\deg} phase angle range is investigated
in order to study the contribution of Shadow Hiding Opposition Effect to the phase behavior. The
behavior is then extrapolated to phase angle of 0{\deg} using a polynomial fit, in order to provide
grounds for comparison across meteorite groups (enabling to remove the contribution of shadows
to reflectance) as well as to provide equivalent albedo values that should be comparable to geometric
albedo values derived for small bodies. We find a general behavior of increasing strength of the
SHOE with lower reflectance values (whether between samples or for a given samples with absorption
features). This trend provides a first order way to correct any reflectance spectra of meteorite
powders measured under standard conditions (g=30) from the contribution of shadows. The g=0 degre
calculated reflectance and equivalent albedos are then compared to typical values of albedos for
main-belt asteroids. This reveals that among carbonaceous chondrites only Tagish Lake group,
CI, and CM chondrites have equivalent albedo compatible with C- and D-type asteroids. On the other
hand equivalent albedo derived with CO, CR and CK chondrites are compatible with L- and K-type asteroids.
The equivalent albedo derived for ordinary chondrites is related to petrographic types, with low-grade
petrographic type (type 3.6 and less) being generally darker that higher petrographic types. This
works provides a framework for further understanding of the asteroids meteorite linkage when combining
with colors and spectroscopy.

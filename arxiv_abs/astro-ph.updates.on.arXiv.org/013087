The NASA Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission is a planetary defense-driven test of
a kinetic impactor on Dimorphos, the satellite of the binary asteroid 65803 Didymos. DART will intercept
Dimorphos at a relative speed of ${\sim}6.5 \text{ km s}^{-1}$, perturbing Dimorphos's orbital
velocity and changing the binary orbital period. We present three independent methods (one analytic
and two numerical) to investigate the post-impact attitude stability of Dimorphos as a function
of its axial ratios, $a/b$ and $b/c$ ($a \ge b \ge c$), and the momentum transfer efficiency $\beta$.
The first method uses a novel analytic approach in which we assume a circular orbit and a point-mass
primary that identifies four fundamental frequencies of motion corresponding to the secondary's
mean motion, libration, precession, and nutation frequencies. At resonance locations among these
four frequencies, we find that attitude instabilities are possible. Using two independent numerical
codes, we recover many of the resonances predicted by the analytic model and indeed show attitude
instability. With one code, we use fast Lyapunov indicators to show that the secondary's attitude
can evolve chaotically near the resonance locations. Then, using a high-fidelity numerical model,
we find that Dimorphos enters a chaotic tumbling state near the resonance locations and is especially
prone to unstable rotation about its long axis, which can be confirmed by ESA's Hera mission arriving
at Didymos in late 2026. We also show that a fully coupled treatment of the spin and orbital evolution
of both bodies is crucial to accurately model the long-term evolution of the secondary's spin state
and libration amplitude. Finally, we discuss the implications of a post-impact tumbling or rolling
state, including the possibility of terminating BYORP evolution if Dimorphos is no longer in synchronous
rotation.

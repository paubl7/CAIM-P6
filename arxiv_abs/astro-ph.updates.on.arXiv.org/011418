Context. Planetary mass and radius data are showing a wide variety in densities of low-mass exoplanets.
This includes sub-Neptunes, whose low densities can be explained with the presence of a volatile-rich
layer. Water is one of the most abundant volatiles, which can be in the form of different phases depending
on the planetary surface conditions. To constrain their composition and interior structure, it
is required to develop models that calculate accurately the properties of water at its different
phases. Aims. We present an interior structure model that includes a multiphase water layer with
steam, supercritical and condensed phases. We derive the constraints for planetary compositional
parameters and their uncertainties, focusing on the multiplanetary system TRAPPIST-1, which
presents both warm and temperate planets. Methods. We use a 1D steam atmosphere in radiative-convective
equilibrium with an interior whose water layer is in supercritical phase self-consistently. For
temperate surface conditions, we implement liquid and ice Ih to ice VII phases in the hydrosphere.
We adopt a MCMC inversion scheme to derive the probability distributions of core and water compositional
parameters Results. We refine the composition of all planets and derive atmospheric parameters
for planets b and c. The latter would be in a post-runaway greenhouse state and could be extended enough
to be probed by space mission such as JWST. Planets d to h present condensed ice phases, with maximum
water mass fractions below 20%. Conclusions. The derived amounts of water for TRAPPIST-1 planets
show a general increase with semi-major axis, with the exception of planet d. This deviation from
the trend could be due to formation mechanisms, such as migration and an enrichment of water in the
region where planet d formed, or an extended CO$_{2}$-rich atmosphere.

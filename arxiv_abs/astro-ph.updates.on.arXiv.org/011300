We report on observations of the active K2 dwarf $\epsilon$ Eridani based on contemporaneous SPIRou,
NARVAL, and TESS data obtained over two months in late 2018, when the activity of the star was reported
to be in a non-cyclic phase. We first recover the fundamental parameters of the target from both visible
and nIR spectral fitting. The large-scale magnetic field is investigated from polarimetric data.
From unpolarized spectra, we estimate the total magnetic flux through Zeeman broadening of magnetically
sensitive nIR lines and the chromospheric emission using the CaII H & K lines. The TESS photometric
monitoring is modeled with pseudo-periodic Gaussian Process Regression. Fundamental parameters
of $\epsilon$ Eridani derived from visible and near-infrared wavelengths provide us with consistent
results, also in agreement with published values. We report a progressive increase of macroturbulence
towards larger nIR wavelengths. Zeeman broadening of individual lines highlights an unsigned
surface magnetic field $B_{\rm mono} = 1.90 \pm 0.13$ kG, with a filling factor $f = 12.5 \pm 1.7$%
(unsigned magnetic flux $Bf = 237 \pm 36$ G). The large-scale magnetic field geometry, chromospheric
emission, and broadband photometry display clear signs of non-rotational evolution over the course
of data collection. Characteristic decay times deduced from the light curve and longitudinal field
measurements fall in the range 30-40 d, while the characteristic timescale of surface differential
rotation, as derived through the evolution of the magnetic geometry, is equal to $57 \pm 5$ d. The
large-scale magnetic field exhibits a combination of properties not observed previously for $\epsilon$
Eridani, with a surface field among the weakest previously reported, but also mostly axisymmetric,
and dominated by a toroidal component.

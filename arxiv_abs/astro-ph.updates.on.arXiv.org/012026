The largest asteroids in the Koronis family (sizes $\geq 25$ km) have very peculiar rotation state
properties, with the retrograde- and prograde-rotating objects being distinctly different.
A recent e-analysis of observations suggests that one of the asteroids formerly thought to be retrograde-rotating,
208~Lacrimosa, in reality exhibits prograde rotation, yet other properties of this object are
discrepant with other members this group. We seek to understand whether the new spin solution of
Lacrimosa invalidates the previously proposed model of the Koronis large members or simply reveals
more possibilities for the long-term evolutionary paths, including some that have not yet been
explored. We confirm and substantiate the previously suggested prograde rotation of Lacrimosa.
Its spin vector has an ecliptic longitude and latitude of $(\lambda,\beta)=(15^\circ \pm 2^\circ,
67^\circ\pm 2^\circ)$ and a sidereal rotation period $P=14.085734\pm 0.000007$ hr. The thermal
and occultation data allow us to calibrate a volume equivalent size of $D=44\pm 2$ km of Lacrimosa.
The observations also constrain the shape model relatively well. Assuming uniform density, the
dynamical ellipticity is $\Delta=0.35\pm 0.05$. Unlike other large prograde-rotating Koronis
members, Lacrimosa spin is not captured in the Slivan state. We propose that Lacrimosa differed
from this group in that it had initially slightly larger obliquity and longer rotation period. With
those parameters, it jumped over the Slivan state instead of being captured and slowly evolved into
the present spin configuration. In the future, it is likely to be captured in the Slivan state corresponding
to the proper (instead of forced) mode of the orbital plane precession in the inertial space.

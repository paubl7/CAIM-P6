In the universe's most massive galaxies, kinetic feedback from a central supermassive black hole
appears to limit star formation. Abundant circumstantial evidence suggests that accumulation
of cold gas near the central black hole strongly boosts the feedback output, keeping the ambient
medium in a state marginally unstable to condensation and formation of cold gas clouds. However,
the ability of that mechanism to self-regulate may depend on numerous environmental factors, including
the depth of the potential well and the pressure of the surrounding circumgalactic medium (CGM).
Here we present a suite of numerical simulations that explores the dependence of cold-fuelled bipolar
kinetic feedback on those environmental factors. Halo mass in this simulation suite ranges from
$2 \times 10^{12} \, M_\odot$ to $8 \times 10^{14} \, M_\odot$. We include the spatially extended
mass and energy input from the massive galaxy's old stellar population, which is capable of sweeping
gas out of the galaxy and away from the central black hole if the confining CGM pressure is sufficiently
low. Our simulations show that this feedback mechanism is tightly self-regulating in a massive
galaxy with a deep central potential and low CGM pressure, permitting only small amounts of multiphase
gas to accumulate and allowing almost no star formation. In a massive galaxy of similar mass but a
shallower central potential and greater CGM pressure the same feedback mechanism is more episodic,
producing extended multiphase gas and occasionally allowing small rates of star formation ($\sim
0.1 \, M_\odot \, {\rm yr}^{-1}$). At the low-mass end of the explored range the mechanism becomes
implausibly explosive, perhaps because the ambient gas initially has no angular momentum, which
would have reduced the amount of condensed gas capable of fueling feedback.

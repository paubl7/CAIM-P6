We present a pilot search of CO emission in three H$_2$-absorbing, long-duration gamma-ray burst
(GRB) host galaxies at z~2-3. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA)
to target the CO(3-2) emission line and report non-detections for all three hosts. These are used
to place limits on the host molecular gas masses, assuming a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H$_2$
conversion factor ($\alpha_{\rm CO}$). We find, $M_{\rm mol} < 3.5\times 10^{10}\,M_{\odot}$
(GRB\,080607), $M_{\rm mol} < 4.7\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ (GRB\,120815A), and $M_{\rm mol}
< 8.9\times 10^{11}\,M_{\odot}$ (GRB\,181020A). The high limits on the molecular gas mass for
the latter two cases are a consequence of their low stellar masses $M_\star$ ($M_\star \lesssim
10^{8}\,M_{\odot}$) and low gas-phase metallicities ($Z\sim 0.03\,Z_{\odot}$). The limit on
the $M_{\rm mol}/M_\star$ ratio derived for GRB\,080607, however, is consistent with the average
population of star-forming galaxies at similar redshifts and stellar masses. We discuss the broader
implications for a metallicity-dependent CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factor, and demonstrate that
the canonical Galactic $\alpha_{\rm CO}$, will severely underestimate the actual molecular gas
mass for all galaxies at $z>1$ with $M_\star < 10^{10}\,M_\odot$. To better quantify this we develop
a simple approach to estimate the relevant $\alpha_{\rm CO}$ factor based only on the redshift and
stellar mass of individual galaxies. The elevated conversion factors will make these galaxies
appear CO-"dark" and difficult to detect in emission, as is the case for the majority of GRB hosts.
GRB spectroscopy thus offers a complementary approach to identify low-metallicity, star-forming
galaxies with abundant molecular gas reservoirs at high redshifts that are otherwise missed by
current ALMA surveys.

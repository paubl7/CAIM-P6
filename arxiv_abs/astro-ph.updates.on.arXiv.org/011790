Dust grains play a major role in many astrophysical contexts. They influence the chemical, magnetic,
dynamical and optical properties of their environment, from galaxies down to the interstellar
medium, star-forming regions, and protoplanetary disks. Their coagulation leads to shifts in
their size distribution and ultimately to the formation of planets. However, although the coagulation
process is reasonably uncomplicated to implement numerically by itself, it is difficult to couple
it with multi-dimensional hydrodynamics numerical simulations because of its high computational
cost. We propose here a simple method to track the coagulation of grains at far lower cost. Given an
initial grain size distribution, the state of the distribution at time t is solely determined by
the value of a single variable integrated along the trajectory, independently of the specific path
taken by the grains. Although this method cannot account for other processes than coagulation,
it is mathematically exact, fast, inexpensive, and can be used to evaluate the impact of grain coagulation
in most astrophysical contexts. Although other processes modifying the size-distribution, as
fragmentation cannot be coupled to this method, it is applicable to all coagulation kernels in which
local physical conditions and grain properties can be separated. We also describe another method
to calculate the average electric charge of grains and the density of ions and electrons in environments
shielded from radiation fields, given the density and temperature of the gas, the cosmic-ray ionization
rate and the average mass of the ions. The equations we provide are fast to integrate numerically,
and can be used in multidimensional numerical simulations to self-consistently calculate, on-the-fly,
the local resistivities needed to model non-ideal magnetohydrodynamics.

The Gamma RAy Polarimeter Experiment (GRAPE), a balloon borne Compton polarimeter for 50-500 keV
gamma rays, was successfully flown for the second time in 2014. GRAPE consists of 24 collimated polarimeter
modules. Each module is made up of 64 rectangular scintillators elements in a grid of 8 $\times$ 8
(36 plastic scintillators surrounded by 28 CsI scintillators). GRAPE uses photon scattered events
between 2 detector elements to measure the polarization of the measured photons. GRAPE was flown
from Fort Sumner, New Mexico on the morning of September 26$^{\text{th}}$ 2014. GRAPE was at float
altitude for 14.4 hours and the Crab (primary target) was observed for 1.8 hours (initially planned
for 8 hours). Background dominates the observations at flight altitudes, which depends on many
flight and instrument parameters (altitude, instrument pointing, temperatures, etc). A technique
based on the Principle Component Analysis (PCA) was implemented which used the varying parameters
to estimate the background for the Crab. Our instrument design allows for an optical crosstalk (a
known issue) that arises from light exiting the scintillator element and spilling to neighboring
anodes. A model was developed to represent the crosstalk, which was incorporated in our simulations
and the instrument response. The analysis was focused on the phase-integrated data (due to limited
statistics of the shortened observation period). A power-law spectrum with photon index of 1.70$\pm$0.24
and a normalization of 1.01$\pm$1.35 ph/keV/s/cm$^2$ was measured. A polarization fraction of
0.43$\pm$0.4 and a polarization angle of 56$^\circ \pm$30$^\circ$ was measured for the phase integrated
Crab observation in the 70-200 keV energy range. This result was not sufficiently significant enough
to further our understanding of the emission mechanism.

The study of the quiet Sun in gamma rays started over a decade ago, and rapidly gained a wide interest.
Gamma rays from the quiet Sun are produced by Cosmic Rays (CRs) interacting with its surface (disk
component) and with its photon field (spatially extended inverse-Compton component, IC). The
latter component is maximum close to the Sun and it is above the background even at large angular distances,
extending over the whole sky. First detected with EGRET, it is studied now with Fermi-LAT with high
statistical significance. Observations of the IC component allow us to obtain information on CR
electrons and positrons close to the Sun and in the heliosphere for the various periods of solar activity
and polarity. They allow to learn about CR interactions and propagation close to stars, in the heliosphere
and on the solar surface, and to understand the Sun itself, its environment, and its activity. Analyses
of solar observations are usually model-driven. Hence advances in model calculations and constraints
from precise CR measurements are timely and needed. Here we present our StellarICS code to compute
the gamma-ray IC emission from the Sun and also from single stars. The code is publicly available
and it is extensively used by the scientific community to analyze Fermi-LAT data. It has been used
by the Fermi-LAT collaboration to produce the solar models released with the FSSC Fermi Tools. Our
modeling provides the basis for analyzing and interpreting high-energy data of the Sun and of stars.
After presenting examples of updated solar IC models in the Fermi-LAT energy range that account
for the various CR measurements, we extend the models to keV, MeV, and TeV energies for predictions
for future possible telescopes such as AMEGO, GECCO, e-ASTROGAM, HAWC, LHAASO, SWGO, and present
X-ray telescopes. We also present predictions for some of the closest and most luminous stars.

The initial mass function (IMF) of stars is a key quantity affecting almost every field of astrophysics,
yet it remains unclear what physical mechanisms determine it. We present the first runs of the STARFORGE
project, using a new numerical framework to follow the formation of individual stars in giant molecular
clouds (GMCs) using the GIZMO code. Our suite include runs with increasingly complex physics, starting
with isothermal ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) and then adding non-isothermal thermodynamics
and protostellar outflows. We show that without protostellar outflows the resulting stellar masses
are an order of magnitude too high, similar to the result in the base isothermal MHD run. Outflows
disrupt the accretion flow around the protostar, allowing gas to fragment and additional stars
to form, thereby lowering the mean stellar mass to a value similar to that observed. The effect of
jets upon global cloud evolution is most pronounced for lower-mass GMCs and dense clumps, so while
jets can disrupt low-mass clouds, they are unable to regulate star formation in massive GMCs, as
they would turn an order unity fraction of the mass into stars before unbinding the cloud. Jets are
also unable to stop the runaway accretion of massive stars, which could ultimately lead to the formation
of stars with masses $\mathrm{>500\,M_\odot}$. Although we find that the mass scale set by jets
is insensitive to most cloud parameters (i.e., surface density, virial parameter), it is strongly
dependent on the momentum loading of the jets (which is poorly constrained by observations) as well
the the temperature of the parent cloud, which predicts slightly larger IMF variations than observed.
We conclude that protostellar jets play a vital role in setting the mass scale of stars, but additional
physics are necessary to reproduce the observed IMF.

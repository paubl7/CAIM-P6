We studied a region of 1.636 square degrees corresponding to the VVV tile $b204$. Using SExtractor,
we analysed photometric data generating a catalogue of extended sources in this area. In order to
confirm these sources as galaxy candidates we visually inspected RGB images looking for typical
galaxy features. Using 2MASX and GCMW catalogued sources we tested completeness and contamination
of our catalogue and define suitable colour cuts to select galaxies. We also compared the observational
results with those obtained from two semi-analytical models on Dark Matter simulations. One galaxy
catalogue was constructed with the SAG semi-analytic model of galaxy formation, and the other one
was constructed with the L-Galaxies semi-analytic model.By adopting CLASS-STAR$< 0.5$, $r_{1/2}
> 0.7$ arcsec and specific colour cuts (J-Ks$>$0.97, J-H$>$0 and H-Ks$>$0) we generated an automatic
catalogue of extended sources. After visual inspection we identified 624 sources with 10$<$Ks$<$17
as galaxy candidates. The contamination of the automatic catalogue is 28% when considering visually
confirmed galaxies as reliable objects. The estimated completeness is 87% up to magnitude Ks=13.5.
We analysed the spatial distribution of galaxy candidates, finding a high concentration of galaxies
in a small region of 15 arcmin radius. This region has three times higher density than similar areas
in the tile. We compared the number of galaxies in this small area with the mean density values obtained
from a suitable sample of galaxies from semi-analytic models finding that our results are consistent
with an overdensity region. Using VVV near-infrared data and mock catalogues we detect new extragalactic
sources that have not been identified by other catalogues. We demonstrate the potentiality of the
VVV survey studying a large number of galaxy candidates and extragalactic structures obscured
by the Milky Way.

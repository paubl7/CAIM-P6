The use of Gaussian processes (GPs) as models for astronomical time series datasets has recently
become almost ubiquitous, given their ease of use and flexibility. GPs excel in particular at marginalization
over the stellar signal in cases where the variability due to starspots rotating in and out of view
is treated as a nuisance, such as in exoplanet transit modeling. However, these effective models
are less useful in cases where the starspot signal is of primary interest since it is not obvious how
the parameters of the GP model are related to the physical properties of interest, such as the size,
contrast, and latitudinal distribution of the spots. Instead, it is common practice to explicitly
model the effect of individual starspots on the light curve and attempt to infer their properties
via optimization or posterior inference. Unfortunately, this process is degenerate, ill-posed,
and often computationally intractable when applied to stars with more than a few spots and/or to
ensembles of many light curves. In this paper, we derive a closed-form expression for the mean and
covariance of a Gaussian process model that describes the light curve of a rotating, evolving stellar
surface conditioned on a given distribution of starspot sizes, contrasts, and latitudes. We demonstrate
that this model is correctly calibrated, allowing one to robustly infer physical parameters of
interest from one or more stellar light curves, including the typical radii and the mean and variance
of the latitude distribution of starspots. Our GP has far-ranging implications for understanding
the variability and magnetic activity of stars from both light curves and radial velocity (RV) measurements,
as well as for robustly modeling correlated noise in both transiting and RV exoplanet searches.
Our implementation is efficient, user-friendly, and open source, available as the Python package
starry-process.

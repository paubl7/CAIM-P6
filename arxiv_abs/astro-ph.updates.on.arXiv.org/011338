Less than one percent of the discovered small solar system objects have highly inclined orbits ($i>60^{\circ}$),
and revolve around the Sun on near-polar or retrograde orbits. The origin and evolutionary history
of these objects are not yet clear. In this work we study the surface properties and orbital dynamics
of selected high-inclination objects. BVRI photometric observations were performed in 2019-2020
using the 2.0m telescope at the Terskol Observatory and the 2.6m telescope at the Crimean Astrophysical
Observatory. Additionally, we searched for high-inclination objects in the Sloan Digital Sky
Survey and Pan-STARRS. The dynamics of the selected objects was studied using numerical simulations.
We obtained new photometric observations of six high-inclination objects. All of the objects have
similar $B-V$, $V-R$, $R-I$ colours, which are close to those of moderately red TNOs and grey Centaurs.
The photometric data that were extracted from the all-sky surveys also correspond to moderately
red surfaces of high-inclination objects. No signs of ultra-red material on the surface of high-inclination
asteroids were found, which supports the results of previous works. The comet C/2018 DO4 (Lemmon)
revealed some complex morphology with structures that could be associated with particles that
were ejected from the cometary nucleus. For objects 2013 LU28, 2015 KZ120, and 2020 EP we estimated
future and past lifetimes on their orbits. It appears that the orbits of considered objects are strongly
chaotic, and with the available accuracy of the orbital elements no reliable predictions can be
made about their distant past or future. The lifetimes of high-inclination objects turned out to
be highly non-sensitive to the precision of the orbital elements, and to the Yarkovsky orbital drift.

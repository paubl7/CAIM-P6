In early type galaxies, externally accreted gas is thought to be the main source of gas replenishment
at late times. We use MUSE integral field spectroscopy data to study the active S0 galaxy NGC 5077,
known to have disturbed dynamics, indicative of a past external interaction. We confirm the presence
of a stellar kinematically distinct core with a diameter of 2.8 kpc, counter-rotating with respect
to the main stellar body of the galaxy. We find that the counter-rotating core consists of an old stellar
population, not significantly different from the rest of the galaxy. The ionised gas is strongly
warped and extends out to 6.5 kpc in the polar direction and in a filamentary structure. The gas dynamics
is complex, with significant changes in the position angle as a function of radius. The ionised gas
line ratios are consistent with LINER excitation by the AGN both in the nucleus and at kiloparsec
scales. We discover a nuclear outflow with projected velocity V ~ 400 km/s, consistent with a hollow
outflow cone intersecting the plan of the sky. The properties of the misaligned gas match predictions
from numerical simulations of misaligned gas infall after a gas-rich merger. The warp and change
in the gas orientation as a function of radius are consistent with gas relaxation due to stellar torques,
that are stronger at small radii where the gas aligns faster than in the outer regions, driving gas
to the nucleus. The stellar and gas dynamics indicate that NGC 5077 has had at least two external interactions,
one that resulted in the formation of the counter-rotating core followed by late time external gas
accretion. NGC 5077 illustrates the importance of external interactions in the replenishment
of the galaxy gas reservoir and the nuclear gas content available for black hole fuelling.

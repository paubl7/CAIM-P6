In this work we generalize the constant-roll condition for minimally coupled canonical scalar
field inflation. Particularly, we shall assume that the scalar field satisfies the condition $\ddot{\phi}=\alpha
(\phi) V'(\phi)$, and we derive the field equations under this assumption. We call the framework
extended constant-roll framework. Accordingly we calculate the inflationary indices and the
corresponding observational indices of inflation. In order to demonstrate the inflationary viability,
we choose three potentials that are problematic in the context of slow-roll dynamics, namely chaotic,
linear power-law and exponential inflation, and by choosing a simple power-law form for the smooth
function $\alpha (\phi)$, we show that in the extended constant-roll framework, the models are
compatible with the latest 2018 Planck constraints on inflation. We also justify appropriately
why we called this new framework extended constant-roll framework, and we show that the condition
$\ddot{\phi}=\alpha (\phi) V'(\phi)$ is equivalent to the condition $\ddot{\phi}=\beta (\phi)
H \dot{\phi}$, with the latter condition being a simple generalization of the constant-roll condition.
Finally, we examine an interesting physical situation, in which a general extended constant-roll
scalar field model is required to satisfy the cosmological tracker condition used in quintessence
models. In contrast to the slow-roll and ordinary constant-roll cases, in which case the tracker
condition is not compatible with neither the slow-roll or the ordinary constant-roll conditions,
the extended constant-roll condition can be compatible with the tracker condition. This feature
leads to a new inflationary phenomenological framework, the essential features of which we develop
in brief.

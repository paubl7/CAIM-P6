We present self-consistent, 3D core-collapse supernova simulations of a 40 $M_\odot$ progenitor
model using the isotropic diffusion source approximation for neutrino transport and an effective
general relativistic potential up to $\sim0.9$~s~postbounce. We consider three different rotational
speeds with initial angular velocities of $\Omega_0=0$,~0.5, and~1~rad~s$^{-1}$ and investigate
the impact of rotation on shock dynamics, black hole formation, and gravitational wave signals.
The rapidly-rotating model undergoes an early explosion at $\sim 250$~ms postbounce and shows
signs of the low $T/|W|$ instability. We do not find black hole formation in this model within $\sim
460$~ms postbounce. In contrast, we find black hole formation at 776~ms~postbounce and 936~ms~postbounce
for the non-rotating and slowly-rotating models, respectively. The slowly-rotating model explodes
at $\sim 650$~ms postbounce and fallback accretion onto the proto-neutron star (PNS) results in
BH formation. In addition, the standing~accretion~shock~instability could induce rotation
on the proto-neutron star with a non-rotating progenitor and gives a black~hole spin parameter
of $a=J/M=0.046$, if the specific angular momentum is conserved during black hole formation. But
for the non-rotating model, without an explosion, all the angular momentum should eventually be
accreted by the BH, resulting in a non-spinning BH. The successful explosion of the slowly-rotating
model drastically slows accretion onto the PNS allowing continued cooling and contraction that
results in an extremely high gravitational-wave frequency ($f\sim3000$~Hz) at black~hole formation,
while the non-rotating model generates gravitational wave signals similar to its 2D counterpart.

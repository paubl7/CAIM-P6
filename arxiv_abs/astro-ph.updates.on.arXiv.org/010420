The recent observation of GW190412, the first high-mass ratio binary black-hole (BBH) merger,
by the LIGO-Virgo Collaboration (LVC) provides a unique opportunity to probe the impact of subdominant
harmonics and precession effects encoded in a gravitational wave signal. We present refined estimates
of source parameters for GW190412 using \texttt{NRSur7dq4}, a recently developed numerical relativity
waveform surrogate model that includes all $\ell \leq 4$ spin-weighted spherical harmonic modes
as well as the full physical effects of precession. We compare our results with two different variants
of phenomenological precessing BBH waveform models, \texttt{IMRPhenomPv3HM} and \texttt{IMRPhenomXPHM},
as well as to the LVC results. Our results are broadly in agreement with \texttt{IMRPhenomXPHM}
results and the reported LVC analysis compiled with the \texttt{SEOBNRv4PHM} waveform model,
but in tension with \texttt{IMRPhenomPv3HM}. Using the \texttt{NRSur7dq4} model, we provide
a tighter constraint on the mass-ratio ($0.26^{+0.07}_{-0.05}$) as compared to the LVC estimate
of $0.28^{+0.13}_{-0.07}$ (both reported as median values withs 90\% credible intervals). We
infer the luminosity distance to be $\sim 4 \%$ larger than the estimated values with phenomenological
models and the quoted LVC result, constrain the binary to be more face-on, and find a broader posterior
for the spin precession parameter. We further find that even though $\ell=4$ harmonic modes have
negligible signal-to-noise ratio, omission of these modes will influence the estimated posterior
distribution of several source parameters including chirp mass, effective inspiral spin, luminosity
distance, and inclination. We also find that commonly used model approximations, such as neglecting
the asymmetric modes (excited during precession), have negligible impact on parameter recovery
for moderate SNR-events similar to GW190412.

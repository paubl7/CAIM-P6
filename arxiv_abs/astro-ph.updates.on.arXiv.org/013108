Large galaxy samples from multi-object IFS surveys now allow for a statistical analysis of the z~0
galaxy population using resolved kinematics. However, the improvement in number statistics comes
at a cost, with multi-object IFS survey more severely impacted by the effect of seeing and lower S/N.
We present an analysis of ~1800 galaxies from the SAMI Galaxy Survey and investigate the spread and
overlap in the kinematic distributions of the spin parameter proxy $\lambda_{Re}$ as a function
of stellar mass and ellipticity. For SAMI data, the distributions of galaxies identified as regular
and non-regular rotators with \textsc{kinemetry} show considerable overlap in the $\lambda_{Re}$-$\varepsilon_e$
diagram. In contrast, visually classified galaxies (obvious and non-obvious rotators) are better
separated in $\lambda_{Re}$ space, with less overlap of both distributions. Then, we use a Bayesian
mixture model to analyse the observed $\lambda_{Re}$-$\log(M_*/M_{\odot})$ distribution.
Below $\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})\sim10.5$, a single beta distribution is sufficient to fit
the complete $\lambda_{Re}$ distribution, whereas a second beta distribution is required above
$\log(M_{\star}/M_{\odot})\sim10.5$ to account for a population of low-$\lambda_{Re}$ galaxies.
While the Bayesian mixture model presents the cleanest separation of the two kinematic populations,
we find the unique information provided by visual classification of kinematic maps should not be
disregarded in future studies. Applied to mock-observations from different cosmological simulations,
the mixture model also predicts bimodal $\lambda_{Re}$ distributions, albeit with different
positions of the $\lambda_{Re}$ peaks. Our analysis validates the conclusions from previous smaller
IFS surveys, but also demonstrates the importance of using kinematic selection criteria that are
dictated by the quality of the observed or simulated data.

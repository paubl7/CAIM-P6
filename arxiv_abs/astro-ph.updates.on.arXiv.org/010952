In the central few degrees of the bulge of the Milky Way there is a flattened structure of gas, dust,
and stars. Due to extreme foreground extinction we possess only sparse information about its (mostly
old) stellar population. Here we present our KMOS low resolution spectroscopic survey of the stars
in the nuclear disk reaching the old populations. In order to obtain an unbiased data set, we sample
stars in the full extinction range along each line-of-sight. We also observe reference fields in
neighboring regions of the bulge. Here we describe the design and execution of the survey and present
first results: line-of-sight velocities, spectral indices, metallicities and temperatures.
We obtain spectra of 3113 stars with a median S/N of 67. We measure velocities for 3051 stars. Of those,
2735 sources have sufficient S/N to estimate temperatures and metallicities. We derive metallicities
using the two strongest features of cool stars in the K-band: CO 2-0 and Na I. We derive our own empirical
calibration using metallicities obtained with higher resolution, observations, and K-band spectra.
We use for calibration 183 giant stars spanning in metallicity from -2.5 to 0.6 dex and covering temperatures
of up to 5500 K. The derived index based metallicities deviate from the calibration values with a
scatter of 0.32 dex. The internal uncertainty of our metallicities is likely smaller, because our
S/N causes errors of 0.13 dex and we observe mostly stars of similar luminosity. We use these metallicity
measurements together with the CO index to derive effective temperatures using literature relations.
Here we publish the catalog. Our data set complements Galactic surveys such as Gaia and APOGEE for
the inner 200 pc radius of the Milky Way which is not readily accessible by those surveys due to extinction.
We will use the derived properties in future papers for further analysis of the nuclear disk.

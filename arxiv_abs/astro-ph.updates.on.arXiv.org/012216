Using the atomic carbon [CI](1$-$0) and [CI](2$-$1) emission maps observed with the $Herschel\
Space\ Observatory$, and CO(1$-$0), HI, infrared and submm maps from literatures, we estimate
the [CI]-to-H$_2$ and CO-to-H$_2$ conversion factors of $\alpha_\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}$, $\alpha_\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}$,
and $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ at a linear resolution $\sim1\,$kpc scale for six nearby galaxies of
M 51, M 83, NGC 3627, NGC 4736, NGC 5055, and NGC 6946. This is perhaps the first effort, to our knowledge,
in calibrating both [CI]-to-H$_2$ conversion factors across the spiral disks at spatially resolved
$\sim1\,$kpc scale though such studies have been discussed globally in galaxies near and far. In
order to derive the conversion factors and achieve these calibrations, we adopt three different
dust-to-gas ratio (DGR) assumptions which scale approximately with metallicity taken from precursory
results. We find that for all DGR assumptions, the $\alpha_\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}$, $\alpha_\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}$,
and $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ are mostly flat with galactocentric radii, whereas both $\alpha_\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}$
and $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ show decrease in the inner regions of galaxies. And the central $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$
and $\alpha_\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}$ values are on average $\sim 2.2$ and $1.8$ times lower than its
galaxy averages. The obtained carbon abundances from different DGR assumptions show flat profiles
with galactocentric radii, and the average carbon abundance of the galaxies is comparable to the
usually adopted value of $3 \times 10^{-5}$. We find that both metallicity and infrared luminosity
correlate moderately with the $\alpha_\mathrm{CO}$ whereas only weakly with either the $\alpha_\mathrm{[CI](1-0)}$
or carbon abundance, and not at all with the $\alpha_\mathrm{[CI](2-1)}$.

Massive data mining of image archives observed with large etendue facilities represents a great
opportunity for orbital amelioration of poorly known virtual impactor asteroids (VIs). There
are more than 1000 VIs known today; most of them have very short observed arcs and many are considered
lost as they became extremely faint soon after discovery. We aim to improve the orbits of VIs and eliminate
their status by data mining the existing image archives. Within the European Near Earth Asteroids
Research (EURONEAR) project, we developed the Virtual Impactor search using Mega-Precovery (VIMP)
software endowed with a very effective (fast and accurate) algorithm to predict apparitions of
candidate pairs for subsequent guided human search. Considering a simple geometric model, the
VIMP algorithm searches for any possible intersection in space and time between the positional
uncertainty of any VI and the bounding sky projection of any image archive. We applied VIMP to mine
the data of 451914 Blanco/DECam images observed between 12 Sep 2012 and 11 Jul 2019, identifying
212 VIs that possibly fall into 1286 candidate images leading to either precovery or recovery events.
Following a careful search of candidate images, we recovered and measured 54 VIs in 183 DECam images.
About 4000 impact orbits were eliminated from both lists, 27 VIs were removed from at least one list,
while 14 objects were eliminated from both lists. The faintest detections were around V~24.0, while
the majority fall between 21<V<23. The minimal orbital intersection distances remains constant
for 67% detections, increasing for eight objects and decreasing for 10 objects. Most eliminated
VIs had short initial arcs of less than 5 days. Some unexpected photometric discovery has emerged
regarding the rotation period of 2018 DB, based on the close inspection of longer trailed VIs and
the measurement of their fluxes along the trails.

During more than 17 years of operation in space INTEGRAL telescope has accumulated large data set
that contains records of hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray astronomical sources. These data can be re-used
in the context of multi-wavelength or multi-messenger studies of astronomical sources and have
to be preserved on long time scales. We present a scientific validation of an interactive online
INTEGRAL data analysis system for multi-wavelength studies of hard X-ray and soft gamma-ray sources.
The online data analysis system generates publication-quality high-level data products: sky
images, spectra and light-curves in response to user queries that define analysis parameters,
such as source position, time and energy interval and binning. The data products can be requested
via a web browser interface or via Application Programming Interface (API) available as a Python
package. The analysis workflow organized to preserve and re-use various intermediate analysis
products, ensuring that frequently requested results are available without delay. The platform
can be deployed in any compatible infrastructure. We report the functionalities and performance
of the online data analysis system by reproducing the benchmark INTEGRAL results on different types
of sources, including bright steady and transient Galactic sources, and bright and weak variable
extra-galactic sources. We compare the results obtained with the online data analysis system with
previously published results on these sources. We consider the INTEGRAL online data analysis as
a demonstrator of more general web-based "data analysis as a service" approach that provides a promising
solution for preservation and maintenance of data analysis tools of astronomical telescopes on
(multi)decade long time scales and facilitates combination of data in multi-wavelength and multi-messenger
studies of astronomical sources.

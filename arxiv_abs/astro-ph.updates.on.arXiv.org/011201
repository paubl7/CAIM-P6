We present a set of self-consistent chemo-dynamical simulations of MW-type galaxies formation
to study the origin of the bimodality of $\alpha$-elements in stellar populations. We explore how
the bimodality is related to the geometrically and kinematically defined stellar discs, gas accretion
and radial migration. We find that the two $\alpha$-sequences are formed in quite different physical
environments. The high-$\alpha$ sequence is formed early from a burst of star formation (SF) in
a turbulent, compact gaseous disc which forms a thick disc. The low-$\alpha$ stellar populations
is the result of quiescent SF supported by the slow accretion of enriched gas onto a radially extended
thin disc. Stellar feedback-driven outflows during the formation of the thick disc are responsible
for the enrichment of the surrounding gaseous halo, which subsequently feeds the disc on a longer
time-scale. During the thin disc phase, chemical evolution reaches an equilibrium metallicity
and abundance, where the stars pile-up. This equilibrium metallicity decreases towards the outer
disc, generating the ridgeline that forms the low-$\alpha$ sequence. We identify a second mechanism
capable of creating a low-$\alpha$ sequence in one of our simulations. Rapid shutdown of the SF,
provoked by the feedback at the end of the thick disc phase, suppresses the chemical enrichment of
the halo gas, which, once accreted onto the star-forming disc, dilutes the ISM at the beginning of
the thin disc formation. Both mechanisms can operate in a galaxy, but the former is expected to occur
when SF efficiency ceases to be dominated by the formation of the thick disc, while the latter can
occur in the inner regions. Being the result of the presence of low and high gas density environments,
the bimodality is independent of any particular merger history, suggesting that it could be much
more widespread than has been claimed.

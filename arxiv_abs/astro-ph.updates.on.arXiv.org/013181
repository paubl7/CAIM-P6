We compute the internal modes of a non-spinning neutron star and its tidal metric perturbation in
general relativity, and determine the effect of relativistic corrections to the modes on mode coupling
and the criterion for instability. Claims have been made that a new hydrodynamic instability can
occur in a neutron star in a binary neutron star system triggered by the nonlinear coupling of the
companion's tidal field to pairs of p-modes and g-modes in it as the binary inspirals toward merger.
This 'PG' instability may be significant since it can influence the binary's inspiral phase by extracting
orbital energy, thereby potentially causing large deviations in their gravitational waveforms
from those predicted by theoretical models that do not account for it. This can result in incorrect
parameter estimation, at best, or mergers going undetected, at worst, owing to the use of deficient
waveform models. On the other hand, better modeling of this instability and its effect on binary
orbits can unravel a new phenomenon and shed light on stellar instabilities, via gravitational
wave observations. So far, all mode-tide coupling instability studies have been formulated in
Newtonian perturbation theory. Neutron stars are compact objects, so relativistic corrections
might be important. We present and test a new code to calculate the relativistic eigenmodes of nonrotating
relativistic stars. We use these relativistic tide and neutron star eigenmodes to compute the mode-tide
coupling strength (MTCS) for a few selected equations of state. The MTCS thus calculated can be at
most tens of percent different from its purely Newtonian value, but we confirm the dependencies
on orbital separation and equation of state found by Newtonian calculations. For some equations
of state, the MTCS is very sensitive to the neutron star crust region, demonstrating the importance
of treating this region accurately.

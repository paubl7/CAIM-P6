Searching in the MaNGA IFU survey, I identify 9 galaxies that have strong Balmer absorption lines
and weak nebular emission lines measured from the spectra integrated over the entire IFUs. The spectral
features measured from the bulk of the stellar light make these galaxies local analogs of high-redshift
spectroscopically-selected post-starburst galaxies, thus, proxies to understand the mechanisms
producing post-starburst galaxies at high-redshifts. I present the distributions of absorption-line
indices and emission-line strengths, as well as stellar kinematics of these local post-starburst
galaxies. Almost all local post-starburst galaxies have central compact emission-line regions
at the central $<1$ kpc, mostly powered by weak star-formation activities. The age-sensitive absorption
line indices EW(H$\delta$) and Dn4000 indicate that the stellar populations at the outskirts are
older. Toy stellar population synthesis models suggest that the entire galaxies are experiencing
a rapid decline of star formation with residual star-formation activities at the centers. These
features demand that most post-starburst galaxies are the aftermath of highly dissipative processes
that drive gas into centers, invoke centrally-concentrated star formation, then quench the galaxies.
Meanwhiles, when measurable, post-starburst galaxies have the directions of maximum stellar
velocity gradients align with photometric major axes, which suggest against major mergers being
the principal driving mechanism, while gas-rich minor mergers are plausible. While directly obtaining
the same quality of spatially-resolved spectra of high-redshift post-starburst galaxies is very
difficult, finding proper local counterparts provides an alternative to understand quenching
processes in the distant Universe.

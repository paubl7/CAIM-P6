The discovery of the moderate differential rotation between the core and the envelope of evolved
solar-like stars could be the signature of a strong magnetic field trapped inside the radiative
interior. The population of intermediate-mass red giants presenting a surprisingly low-amplitude
of their mixed modes could also arise from the effect of an internal magnetic field. Indeed, stars
more massive than about 1.1Ms are known to develop a convective core during their main sequence,
which could relax into a strong fossil magnetic field trapped inside the core of the star for the rest
of its evolution. The observations of mixed modes can constitute an excellent probe of the deepest
layers of evolved solar-like stars. The magnetic perturbation on mixed modes may thus be visible
in asteroseismic data. To unravel which constraints can be obtained from observations, we theoretically
investigate the effects of a plausible mixed axisymmetric magnetic field with various amplitudes
on the mixed-mode frequencies of evolved solar-like stars. The first-order frequency perturbations
are computed for dipolar and quadrupolar mixed modes. These computations are carried out for a range
of stellar ages, masses, and metallicities. We show that typical fossil-field strengths of 0.1-1
MG, consistent with the presence of a dynamo in the convective core during the main sequence, provoke
significant asymmetries on mixed-mode frequency multiplets during the red-giant branch. We show
that these signatures may be detectable in asteroseismic data for field amplitudes small enough
for the amplitude of the modes not to be affected by the conversion of gravity into Alfven waves inside
the magnetised interior. Finally, we infer an upper limit for the strength of the field, and the associated
lower limit for the timescale of its action, to redistribute angular momentum in stellar interiors.

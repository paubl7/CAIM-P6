Pulsars in the Galactic Centre promise to enable unparalleled tests of gravity theories and black
hole physics and serve as probes of the stellar formation history and evolution and the interstellar
medium in the complex central region of the Milky Way. Since decades, the community surveyed the
innermost region of the galaxy without detecting a population of pulsars, which is puzzling. A strong
scattering of the pulsed signals in this particular direction has been argued as a potential reason
for the non-detections. With scattering having a strong inverse dependence with observing frequency,
an effective way to alleviate its impact is to use higher frequencies when surveying for pulsars
in the Galactic Centre, in particular close to the supermassive black hole, Sagittarius A*. Here,
we present the first pulsar survey at short millimetre wavelengths, using several frequency bands
between 84 and 156 GHz (3.57-1.92 mm), targeted to the Galactic Centre. The observations were done
with the Institut de Radioastronomie Millimetrique (IRAM) 30m Telescope on 28 epochs between 2016
December and 2018 May. This survey is the first essentially unaffected by scattering and therefore
unbiased in population coverage, including fast-spinning pulsars that might be out of reach of
lower-frequency Galactic Centre surveys. We discovered no new pulsars, a result that we relate
mainly to the decreased flux density of pulsars at high frequencies combined with our current sensitivity.
However, we demonstrate that surveys at these extremely high radio frequencies are capable of discovering
new pulsars, analyse their sensitivity limits with respect to a simulated Galactic Centre pulsar
population, and discuss the major challenges and how to improve similar surveys in the future.

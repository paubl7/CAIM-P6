NenuFAR (New extension in Nan\c{c}ay upgrading LoFAR) is a new radio telescope developed and built
on the site of the Nan\c{c}ay Radio Observatory. It is designed to observe the largely unexplored
frequency window from 10 to 85\,MHz, offering a high sensitivity across its full bandwidth. NenuFAR
has started its "early science" operation in July 2019, with 58\% of its final collecting area being
available. Pulsars are one of the major topics for the scientific exploitation of this frequency
range and represent an important challenge in terms of instrumentation. Designing instrumentation
at these frequencies is complicated by the need to compensate for the effects of both the interstellar
medium and the ionosphere on the observed signal. Our real-time pipeline LUPPI (Low frequency Ultimate
Pulsar Processing Instrumentation) is able to cope with a high data rate and to provide real-time
coherent de-dispersion down to the lowest frequencies reached by NenuFAR (10\,MHz). The full backend
functionality is described, as well as the main pulsar observing modes (folded, single-pulse,
waveform, and dynamic spectrum). This instrumentation allowed us to detect 172 pulsars in our first
targeted search below 85\,MHz, including 10 millisecond pulsars (6 of which detected for the first
time below 100 MHz). We also present some of the "early science" results of NenuFAR on pulsars: a high
frequency resolution mapping of PSR B1919$+$21's emission profile and a detailed observation
of single-pulse sub-structures from PSR~B0809$+$74 down to 16\,MHz, the high rate of giant-pulse
emission from the Crab pulsar detected at 68.7\,MHz (43 events/min), and the illustration of the
very good timing performance of the instrumentation, allowing us to study dispersion measure variations
in great detail.

The Curiosity rover investigated a topographic structure known as Vera Rubin ridge, associated
with a hematite signature in orbital spectra. There, Curiosity encountered mudstones interpreted
as lacustrine deposits, in continuity with the 300 m-thick underlying sedimentary rocks of the
Murray formation at the base of Mount Sharp. While the presence of hematite ($\alpha$-Fe2O3) was
confirmed insitu by both Mastcam and ChemCam spectral observations and by the CheMin instrument,
neither ChemCam nor APXS observed any significant increase in FeO$_T$ (total iron oxide) abundances
compared to the Murray formation. Instead, Curiosity discovered dark-toned diagenetic features
displaying anomalously high FeO$_T$ abundances, commonly observed in association with light-toned
Ca-sulfate veins but also as crystal pseudomorphs in the host rock. These iron-rich diagenetic
features are predominantly observed in "grey" outcrops on the upper part of the ridge, which lack
the telltale ferric signature of other Vera Rubin ridge outcrops. Their composition is consistent
with anhydrous Fe-oxide, as the enrichment in iron is not associated with enrichment in any other
elements, nor with detections of volatiles. The lack of ferric absorption features in the ChemCam
reflectance spectra and the hexagonal crystalline structure associated with dark-toned crystals
points toward coarse "grey" hematite. In addition, the host rock adjacent to these features appears
bleached and show low-FeO$_T$ content as well as depletion in Mn, indicating mobilization of these
redox-sensitive elements during diagenesis. Thus, groundwater fluid circulations could account
for the remobilization of iron and recrystallization as crystalline hematite during diagenesis
as well as color variations observed in the Vera Rubin ridge outcrops.

"Changing-look quasars" (CLQs) are active galactic nuclei (AGN) showing extreme variability
that results in a transition from Type 1 to Type 2. The short timescales of these transitions present
a challenge to the unified model of AGN and the physical processes causing these transitions remain
poorly understood. CLQs also provide interesting samples for the study of AGN host galaxies since
the central emission disappears almost entirely. Previous searches for CLQs have utilised photometric
variability or SDSS classification changes to systematically identify CLQs, this approach may
miss lower luminosity CLQs. In this paper, we aim to use spectroscopic data to asses if analysis difference
spectra can be used to detect further changing look quasars missed by photometric searches. We search
SDSS-II DR 7 repeat spectra for sources that exhibit either a disappearance or appearance of both
broad line emission and accretion disk continuum emission by directly analysing the difference
spectrum between two epochs of observation. From a sample of 24,782 objects with difference spectra,
our search yielded six CLQs within the redshift range $0.1 \leq z \leq 0.3$, including four newly
identified sources. Spectral analysis indicates that changes in accretion rate can explain the
changing-look behaviour. While a change in dust extinction fits the changes in spectral shape,
the time-scales of the changes observed are too short for obscuration from torus clouds. Using difference
spectra was shown to be an effective and sensitive way to detect CLQs. We recover CLQs an order of magnitude
lower in luminosities than those found by photometric searches and achieve higher completeness
than spectroscopic searches relying on pipeline classification.

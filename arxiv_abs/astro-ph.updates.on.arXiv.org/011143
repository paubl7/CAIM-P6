The nonthermal source abundances of elements play a crucial role in the understanding of cosmic
ray (CR) phenomena from a few GeV up to several tens of EeV. We present a first systematic approach
to describe the change of the abundances from the thermal to the nonthermal state via diffusive shock
acceleration by a temporally evolving shock. We consider hereby not only ionization states of elements
contained in the ambient gas, which we allow to be time dependent due to shock heating, but also elements
condensed on solid, charged dust grains which can be injected into the acceleration process as well.
Our generic parametrized model is then applied to the case of particle acceleration by supernova
remnants in various ISM phases, for which we use state-of-the-art computation packages to calculate
the ionization states of all elements. The resulting predictions for low energy cosmic ray (LECR)
source abundances are compared with the data obtained by various experiments. We obtain excellent
agreement for shocks in warm ionized ISM environments, which include HII regions, if dust grains
are injected into the diffusive shock acceleration process with a much higher efficiency than ions.
Less dependence of the fit quality is found on the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. For neutral environments,
assuming that there are shocks in the weakly ionized component, and for the hot ionized medium we
obtain generally inferior fits, but except for the cold neutral medium we do not exclude them as subdominant
sites of Galactic CR production. The key challenge is found to be putting the LECR abundance of pure
gas phase elements like neon and the (semi-)volatile elements phosphorus, sulfur and chlorine
into the right balance with silicon, calcium and elements of the iron group. Finally, a brief outlook
to the potential consequences for the understanding of the CR composition at higher energies is
presented.

The Centaur (10199) Chariklo has the first rings system discovered around a small object. It was
first observed using stellar occultation in 2013. Stellar occultations allow the determination
of sizes and shapes with kilometre accuracy and obtain characteristics of the occulting object
and its vicinity. Using stellar occultations observed between 2017 and 2020, we aim at constraining
Chariklo's and its rings physical parameters. We also determine the rings' structure, and obtain
precise astrometrical positions of Chariklo. We predicted and organised several observational
campaigns of stellar occultations by Chariklo. Occultation light curves were measured from the
data sets, from which ingress and egress times, and rings' width and opacity were obtained. These
measurements, combined with results from previous works, allow us to obtain significant constraints
on Chariklo's shape and rings' structure. We characterise Chariklo's ring system (C1R and C2R),
and obtain radii and pole orientations that are consistent with, but more accurate than, results
from previous occultations. We confirmed the detection of W-shaped structures within C1R and an
evident variation of radial width. The observed width ranges between 4.8 and 9.1 km with a mean value
of 6.5 km. One dual observation (visible and red) does not reveal any differences in the C1R opacity
profiles, indicating ring particle's size larger than a few microns. The C1R ring eccentricity
is found to be smaller than 0.022 (3-sigma), and its width variations may indicate an eccentricity
higher than 0.005. We fit a tri-axial shape to Chariklo's detections over eleven occultations and
determine that Chariklo is consistent with an ellipsoid with semi-axes of 143.8, 135.2 and 99.1
km. Ultimately, we provided seven astrometric positions at a milliarcseconds accuracy level,
based on Gaia EDR3, and use it to improve Chariklo's ephemeris.

Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are potential hosts of the elusive early phases of high-mass star formation
(HMSF). Here we conduct an in-depth analysis of the fragmentation properties of a sample of 10 IRDCs,
which have been highlighted as some of the best candidates to study HMSF within the Milky Way. To do
so, we have obtained a set of large mosaics covering these IRDCs with ALMA at band 3 (or 3mm). These
observations have a high angular resolution (~3arcsec or ~0.05pc), and high continuum and spectral
line sensitivity (~0.15mJy/beam and ~0.2K per 0.1km/s channel at the N2H+(1-0) transition). From
the dust continuum emission, we identify 96 cores ranging from low- to high-mass (M = 3.4 to 50.9Msun)
that are gravitationally bound (alpha_vir = 0.3 to 1.3) and which would require magnetic field strengths
of B = 0.3 to 1.0mG to be in virial equilibrium. We combine these results with a homogenised catalogue
of literature cores to recover the hierarchical structure within these clouds over four orders
of magnitude in spatial scale (0.01pc to 10pc). Using supplementary observations at an even higher
angular resolution, we find that the smallest fragments (<0.02pc) within this hierarchy do not
currently have the mass and/or the density required to form high-mass stars. Nonetheless, the new
ALMA observations presented in this paper have facilitated the identification of 19 (6 quiescent
and 13 star-forming) cores that retain >16Msun without further fragmentation. These high-mass
cores contain trans-sonic non-thermal motions, are kinematically sub-virial, and require moderate
magnetic field strengths for support against collapse. The identification of these potential
sites of high-mass star formation represents a key step in allowing us to test the predictions from
high-mass star and cluster formation theories.

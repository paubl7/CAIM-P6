Gravitational-wave (GW) memory effects produce permanent shifts in the GW strain and its time integrals
after the passage of a burst of GWs. Their presence is closely tied to symmetries of asymptotically
flat spacetimes and fluxes of conserved charges conjugate to these symmetries. While the phenomenology
of GW memory effects is well understood in general relativity (GR), it is less well understood in
the many modifications to GR. We recently computed asymptotically flat solutions, symmetries,
conserved quantities, and GW memory effects in one such modified theory: Brans-Dicke theory. In
this paper, we apply our results from this earlier work to compute the GW memories from compact binaries
in the post-Newtonian (PN) approximation. In addition to taking the PN limit of these effects, we
work in the approximation that the energy and angular momentum losses through scalar radiation
are small compared to the energy and angular momentum losses through (tensor) GWs. We focus on the
tensor (as opposed to scalar) GW memory effect, which we compute through Newtonian order, and the
small differences induced by scalar radiation at this order. Specifically, we compute the nonlinear
parts of the tensor displacement and spin GW memory effects produced during the inspiral of quasicircular,
nonprecessing binaries in Brans-Dicke theory. Because the energy radiated through the scalar
dipole moment appears as a -1 PN order-effect, then in this approximation, the displacement memory
has a logarithmic dependence on the PN parameter and the spin memory has a relative -1 PN-order correction;
these corrections are ultimately small because they are related to the total energy and angular
momentum radiated in the scalar field, respectively. At Newtonian order, the scalar radiation
also gives rise to a sky pattern of the memory effect around an isolated source that differs from that
of the memory effect in GR.

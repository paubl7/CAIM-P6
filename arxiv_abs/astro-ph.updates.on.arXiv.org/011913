Interstellar dust grains are non-spherical and, in some environments, partially aligned along
the direction of the interstellar magnetic field. Numerous alignment theories have been proposed,
all of which examine the grain rotational dynamics. In 1999, Lazarian & Draine introduced the important
concept of thermal flipping, in which internal relaxation processes induce the grain body to flip
while its angular momentum remains fixed. Through detailed numerical simulations, we study the
role of thermal flipping on the grain dynamics during periods of relatively slow rotation, known
as `crossovers', for the special case of a spheroidal grain with a non-uniform mass distribution.
Lazarian & Draine proposed that rapid flipping during a crossover would lead to `thermal trapping',
in which a systematic torque, fixed relative to the grain body, would time average to zero, delaying
spin-up to larger rotational speeds. We find that the time-averaged systematic torque is not zero
during the crossover and that thermal trapping is not prevalent. As an application, we examine whether
the classic Davis-Greenstein alignment mechanism is viable, for grains residing in the cold neutral
medium and lacking superparamagnetic inclusions. We find that Davis-Greenstein alignment is
not hindered by thermal trapping, but argue that it is, nevertheless, too inefficient to yield the
alignment of large grains responsible for optical and infrared starlight polarization. Davis-Greenstein
alignment of small grains could potentially contribute to the observed ultraviolet polarization.
The theoretical and computational tools developed here can also be applied to analyses of alignment
via radiative torques and rotational disruption of grains.

The heliocentric redshifts ($z_\text{hel}$) reported for 150 Type Ia supernovae in the Pantheon
compilation are significantly discrepant from their corresponding values in the JLA compilation,
with 58 having differences between 5 and 137 times the measurement uncertainty. Both catalogues
include corrections to the redshifts & magnitudes of the supernovae to account for the motion of
the heliocentric frame relative to the `CMB rest frame', as well as corrections for the directionally
coherent bulk motion of local galaxies with respect to this frame. The latter is done employing modelling
of peculiar velocities which assume the $\Lambda$CDM cosmological model but nevertheless provide
evidence for residual bulk flows which are discordant with this model. Until recently these peculiar
velocity corrections in the Pantheon catalogue were made at redshifts exceeding 0.2 although no
data on which to base such corrections is available. We study the impact of these vexed issues on the
$4.4\sigma$ discrepancy between the Hubble constant of $67.4\pm0.5$ km/s/Mpc inferred from observations
of CMB anisotropies by Planck assuming $\Lambda$CDM, and the measurement of e.g. $73.5\pm1.4$
km/s/Mpc by the SH0ES project which extended the local distance ladder using Type Ia supernovae.
Using the same methodology as the latter study we find that for supernovae whose redshifts are discrepant
between Pantheon and JLA with $\Delta z_\text{hel}>0.0025$, the Pantheon redshifts favour $H_0\simeq72$
km/s/Mpc, while the JLA redshifts favour $H_0\simeq68$ km/s/Mpc. Thus the discrepancies between
publicly available SNe Ia datasets are sufficient to undermine the claimed `Hubble tension'. We
further note the systematic variation of $H_0$ by $\sim 9$ km/s/Mpc across the sky seen in multiple
datasets, implying that it cannot be measured to better than $\sim 13\%$ precision in a model-independent
manner.

Context. The paths followed by the known extreme trans-Neptunian objects (ETNOs) effectively
avoid direct gravitational perturbations from the four giant planets, yet their orbital eccentricities
are in the range between 0.69-0.97. Solar system dynamics studies show that such high values of the
eccentricity can be produced via close encounters or secular perturbations. In both cases, the
presence of yet-to-be-discovered trans-Plutonian planets is required. Aims. If the high eccentricities
of the known ETNOs are the result of relatively recent close encounters with putative planets, the
mutual nodal distances of sizeable groups of ETNOs with their assumed perturber may still be small
enough to be identifiable geometrically. In order to confirm or reject this possibility, we used
Monte Carlo random search techniques. Methods. Two arbitrary orbits may lead to close encounters
when their mutual nodal distance is sufficiently small. We generated billions of random planetary
orbits with parameters within the relevant ranges and computed the mutual nodal distances with
a set of randomly generated orbits with parameters consistent with those of the known ETNOs and their
uncertainties. We monitored which planetary orbits had the maximum number of potential close encounters
with synthetic ETNOs and we studied the resulting distributions. Results. We provide narrow ranges
for the orbital parameters of putative planets that may have experienced orbit-changing encounters
with known ETNOs. Conclusions. Our calculations suggest that more than one perturber is required
if scattering is the main source of orbital modification for the known ETNOs. Perturbers might not
be located farther than 600 AU and they have to follow moderately eccentric and inclined orbits to
be capable of experiencing close encounters with multiple known ETNOs.

Line-driven wind instability is expected to cause small-scale wind inhomogeneities, X-ray emission,
and wind line profile variability. The instability can already develop around the sonic point if
it is initiated close to the photosphere due to stochastic turbulent motions. In such cases, it may
leave its imprint on the light curve as a result of wind blanketing. We study the photometric signatures
of the line-driven wind instability. We used line-driven wind instability simulations to determine
the wind variability close to the star. We applied two types of boundary perturbations: a sinusoidal
one that enables us to study in detail the development of the instability and a stochastic one given
by a Langevin process that provides a more realistic boundary perturbation. We estimated the photometric
variability from the resulting mass-flux variations. The variability was simulated assuming
that the wind consists of a large number of independent conical wind sectors. We compared the simulated
light curves with TESS light curves of OB stars that show stochastic variability. We find two typical
signatures of line-driven wind instability in photometric data: a knee in the power spectrum of
magnitude fluctuations, which appears due to engulfment of small-scale structure by larger structures,
and a negative skewness of the distribution of fluctuations, which is the result of spatial dominance
of rarefied regions. These features endure even when combining the light curves from independent
wind sectors. The stochastic photometric variability of OB stars bears certain signatures of the
line-driven wind instability. The distribution function of observed photometric data shows negative
skewness and the power spectra of a fraction of light curves exhibit a knee. This can be explained
as a result of the line-driven wind instability triggered by stochastic base perturbations.

The Low Frequency Array (LOFAR) Two-metre Sky Survey (LoTSS) is a sensitive, high-resolution 120-168
MHz survey split across multiple tiers over the northern sky. The first LoTSS Deep Fields data release
consists of deep radio continuum imaging at 150 MHz of the Bo\"{o}tes, European Large Area Infrared
Space Observatory Survey-North 1 (ELAIS-N1), and Lockman Hole fields, down to rms sensitivities
of $\sim$32, 20, and 22 $\mu$Jy beam$^{-1}$, respectively. In this paper we present consistent
photometric redshift (photo-$z$) estimates for the optical source catalogues in all three fields
- totalling over 7 million sources ($\sim5$ million after limiting to regions with the best photometric
coverage). Our photo-$z$ estimation uses a hybrid methodology that combines template fitting
and machine learning and is optimised to produce the best possible performance for the radio continuum
selected sources and the wider optical source population. Comparing our results with spectroscopic
redshift samples, we find a robust scatter ranging from 1.6 to 2% for galaxies and 6.4 to 7% for identified
optical, infrared, or X-ray selected active galactic nuclei (AGN). Our estimated outlier fractions
($\left | z_{\text{phot}} - z_{\text{spec}} \right | / (1+z_{\text{spec}}) > 0.15$) for the corresponding
subsets range from 1.5 to 1.8% and 18 to 22%, respectively. Replicating trends seen in analyses of
previous wide-area radio surveys, we find no strong trend in photo-$z$ quality as a function of radio
luminosity for a fixed redshift. We exploit the broad wavelength coverage available within each
field to produce galaxy stellar mass estimates for all optical sources at $z < 1.5$. Stellar mass
functions derived for each field are used to validate our mass estimates, with the resulting estimates
in good agreement between each field and with published results from the literature.

Since the discovery of exoplanets around pulsars, there has been a debate on their origin. Popular
scenarios include in situ formation or the dynamical capture of a planet in a dense stellar system.
The possibility of a planet surviving its host star's supernova is often neglected, because a planet
in orbit around a single exploding star is not expected to survive the supernova. A circum-binary
planet, however, may stand a chance in staying bound when one of the binary components explodes.
We investigate the latter and constrain the distribution of post-supernova orbital parameters
of circum-binary planets. This is done by performing population synthesis calculations of binary
stars until the first supernova. Just before the supernova, we add a planet in orbit around the binary
to study its survivability. In our supernova model, the exploding star's mass is assumed to change
instantaneously, and we apply a velocity kick to the newly formed remnant. The mass loss and velocity
kick affect the orbits of the two stars and the planet. Only $2 \cdot 10^{-3}$ of systems survive the
supernova while keeping the circum-binary planet bound. The surviving planetary orbits are wide
($a \apgt 10$ au) and eccentric ($e \apgt 0.3$). It turns out much more likely ($3\cdot 10^{-2}$ system
fraction) that the newly formed compact object is ejected from the system, leaving the planet bound
to its companion star in a highly eccentric orbit (typically $\apgt 0.9$). We expect that the Milky
way Galaxy hosts at most $10$ x-ray binaries that are still orbited by a planet, and $\aplt 150$ planets
that survived in orbit around the compact object's companion. These numbers should be convolved
with the fraction of massive binaries that is orbited by a planet.

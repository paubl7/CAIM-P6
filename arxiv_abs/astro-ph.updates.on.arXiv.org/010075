Motivated by prior remote observations of a transition from striated solar coronal structures
to more isotropic ``flocculated'' fluctuations, we propose that the dynamics of the inner solar
wind just outside the Alfv\'en critical zone, and in the vicinity of the first $\beta=1$ surface,
is powered by the relative velocities of adjacent coronal magnetic flux tubes. We suggest that large
amplitude flow contrasts are magnetically constrained at lower altitude but shear-driven dynamics
are triggered as such constraints are released above the Alfv\'en critical zone, as suggested by
global magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations that include self-consistent turbulence transport.
We argue that this dynamical evolution accounts for features observed by {\it Parker Solar Probe}
({\it PSP}) near initial perihelia, including magnetic ``switchbacks'', and large transverse
velocities that are partially corotational and saturate near the local Alfv\'en speed. Large-scale
magnetic increments are more longitudinal than latitudinal, a state unlikely to originate in or
below the lower corona. We attribute this to preferentially longitudinal velocity shear from varying
degrees of corotation. Supporting evidence includes comparison with a high Mach number three-dimensional
compressible MHD simulation of nonlinear shear-driven turbulence, reproducing several observed
diagnostics, including characteristic distributions of fluctuations that are qualitatively
similar to {\it PSP} observations near the first perihelion. The concurrence of evidence from remote
sensing observations, {\it in situ} measurements, and both global and local simulations supports
the idea that the dynamics just above the Alfv\'en critical zone boost low-frequency plasma turbulence
to the level routinely observed throughout the explored solar system.

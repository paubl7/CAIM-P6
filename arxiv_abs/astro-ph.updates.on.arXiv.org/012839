{The Galactic centre (GC) is a unique astrophysical laboratory to study the stellar population
of galactic nuclei because it is the only galactic nucleus whose stars can be resolved down to milliparsec
scales. However, the extreme and spatially highly variable interstellar extinction towards the
GC poses a serious obstacle to photometric stellar classification.} {Our goal is to identify hot,
massive stars in the nuclear stellar disc (NSD) region through combining near-infrared (NIR) and
mid-infrared (MIR) photometry, and thus to demonstrate the feasibility of this technique, which
may gain great importance with the arrival of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).} {We combined
the GALACTICNUCLEUS NIR survey with the IRAC/Spitzer MIR survey of the GC. We applied the so-called
Rayleigh-Jeans colour excess (RJCE) de-reddening method to our combined NIR-MIR data to identify
potential hot stars in colour-magnitude diagrams (CMDs).} {Despite the very low angular resolution
of IRAC we find 12 clear candidates for young massive stars among the $1\,065$ sources that meet our
selection criteria. Seven out of these 12 stars are previously known hot, massive stars belonging
to the Arches and Quintuplet clusters, as well as sources detected by the Hubble Space Telescope/NICMOS
Paschen-$\alpha$ survey. Five of our massive star candidates have not been previously reported
in the literature.} {We show that the RJCE method is a valuable tool to identify hot stars in the GC
using photometry alone. Upcoming instruments with high angular resolution MIR imaging capabilities
such as the JWST could surely make more substantial use of this de-reddening method and help establish
a far more complete census of hot, young stars in the GC area than what is possible at the moment.}

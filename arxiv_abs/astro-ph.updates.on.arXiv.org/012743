We study the angular correlation function of star-forming galaxies and properties of their host
dark matter halos at z>1 using the Hyper-Suprime Cam (HSC) SSP survey. We use [OII] emitters identified
using two narrow-band (NB) filters, NB816 and NB921, in the Deep/UltraDeep layers, which respectively
cover large angular areas of 16.3 deg^2 and 16.9 deg^2. Our sample contains 8302 and 9578 [OII] emitters
at z=1.19 (NB816) and z=1.47 (NB921), respectively. We detect a strong clustering signal over a
wide angular range, 0.001 < \theta < 1 [deg], with the bias $b=1.61^{+0.13}_{-0.11}$ (z=1.19) and
$b=2.09^{+0.17}_{-0.15}$ (z=1.47). We also find a clear deviation of the correlation from a simple
power-law form. To interpret the measured clustering signal, we adopt a halo occupation distribution
(HOD) model that is constructed to explain the spatial distribution of galaxies selected by a star
formation rate. The observed correlation function and number density are simultaneously explained
by the best-fitting HOD model. From the constrained HOD model, the average mass of halos hosting
the [OII] emitters is derived to be $\log{M_{eff}/(h^{-1}M_\odot)}=12.70^{+0.09}_{-0.07}$
and $12.61^{+0.09}_{-0.05}$ at z=1.19 and 1.47, respectively, which will become halos with the
present-day mass, $M\sim 1.5 \times 10^{13}h^{-1}M_\odot$. The satellite fraction of the [OII]
emitter sample is found to be $f_{sat}\sim 0.15$. All these values are consistent with the previous
studies of similar samples, but we obtain tighter constraints even in a larger parameter space due
to the larger sample size from the HSC. The results obtained for host halos of [OII] emitters in this
paper enable the construction of mock galaxy catalogs and the systematic forecast study of cosmological
constraints from upcoming emission line galaxy surveys such as the Subaru PFS survey.

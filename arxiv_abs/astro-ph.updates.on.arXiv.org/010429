Quasi-periodic fluctuations in the light curves of blazars can provide insight into the underlying
emission process. This type of flux modulation hints at periodic physical processes that result
in emission. CTA 102, a flat spectrum radio quasar at $z=1.032$, has displayed significant activity
since 2016. The multi-waveband light curve of CTA 102 shows signs of quasi-periodic oscillations
during the 2016-2017 flare. Our goal is to quantify the presence of any periodicity in the emitted
flux during the mentioned period and to explore the causes that can give rise to it. Techniques such
as the Lomb-Scargle periodogram and weighted wavelet z-transform were employed to observe the
power emitted at different frequencies. To quantify the significance of the dominant period, Monte-Carlo
techniques were employed considering an underlying smooth bending power-law model for the power
spectrum. In addition, the light curve was modeled using an autoregressive process to analytically
obtain the significance of the dominant period. Lastly, the light curve was modeled using a generalized
autoregressive integrated moving average process to check whether introducing a periodic component
results in a statistically preferable model. Significant, simultaneous quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) were observed in the $\gamma$-ray and optical fluxes of blazar CTA 102 during its 2016-2017
flare. The periodic flux modulation had a dominant period of $\sim$ 7.6 days and lasted for $\sim$
8 cycles (MJD 57710-57770). All of the methods used point toward significant ($>4\sigma$) quasi-periodic
modulation in both $\gamma$-ray and optical fluxes. Several possible models were explored while
probing the origin of the periodicity, and by extension, the 2016--2017 optical flare. The best
explanation for the detected QPO appears to be a region of enhanced emission, moving helically inside
the jet.

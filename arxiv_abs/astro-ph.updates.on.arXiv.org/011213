AU Mic is a young, active star around which a transiting planet has been recently detected. Here we
report an analysis of its TESS light curve where we model the quasi-periodic rotational modulation
by starspots simultaneously to the flaring activity and planetary transits. We measured a flare
occurrence rate of 6.35 flares-per-day for flares with amplitudes in the range $0.06\% < f_{\rm
max} < 1.5\%$ of the star flux. We employ a Bayesian MCMC analysis to model the five transits of AU Mic
b observed by TESS, improving the constraints on the planetary parameters. The measured planet-to-star
radius ratio of $0.05345^{+0.00014}_{-0.00015}$ implies a physical radius of $4.38\pm0.18$
M$_\oplus$ and a planet density of $1.1\pm0.3$ g\,cm$^{-3}$, confirming that AU Mic b is a Neptune-size
moderately inflated planet. Whereas a single feature possibly due to a second planet was previously
reported in the former TESS data, we report the detection of two additional transit-like events
in the new TESS observations of July 2020. This represents substantial evidence for a second planet
(AU Mic c) in the system. We analyzed its three available transits and obtained an orbital period
of $18.858991\pm0.000010$ d and a planetary radius of $3.51\pm0.16$ R$_\oplus$, which defines
AU Mic c as a warm Neptune-size planet with an expected mass in the range 1.7 M$_\oplus < M_{\rm c} <
27.7$ M$_\oplus$. The two planets in the AU Mic system are in near 9:4 mean-motion resonance. We show
that this configuration is dynamically stable and should produce TTV. Our non-detection of significant
TTV in AU Mic b suggests an upper limit to the mass of AU Mic c of $<7$ M$_\oplus$. Being a young multi-planet
system with at least two transiting planets, AU Mic becomes a key system for the study of atmospheres
of infant planets as well as of planet-planet and planet-disk dynamics at the early stages of planetary
evolution.

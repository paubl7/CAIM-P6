Solar observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array (ALMA) facilitate
studying the atmosphere of the Sun at chromospheric heights at high spatial and temporal resolution
at millimeter wavelengths. ALMA intensity data at mm-wavelengths are used for a first detailed
systematic assessment of the occurrence and properties of small-scale dynamical features in the
quiet Sun. ALMA Band 3 data (~ $3$ mm / $100$ GHz) with spatial resolution ~ $1.4$ - $2.1$ arcsec and
a duration of ~ $40$ min are analysed together with SDO/HMI magnetograms. The temporal evolution
of the mm-maps is studied to detect pronounced dynamical features which are connected to dynamical
events via a k-means clustering algorithm. The physical properties of the resulting events are
studied and it is explored if they show properties consistent with propagating shock waves. For
this purpose, observable shock wave signatures at mm wavelengths are calculated from one- and three-dimensional
model atmospheres. There are 552 dynamical events detected with an excess in brightness temperature
($\Delta T_\text{b}$) of at least $\geq 400$ K. The events show a large variety in size up to ~ $9$ arcsec,
amplitude $\Delta T_\text{b}$ up to ~ $1200$ K with typical values between ~ $450$ - $750$ K and lifetime
at FWHM of $\Delta T_\text{b}$ between ~ $43$ - $360$ s, with typical values between ~ $55$ - $125$
s. Furthermore, many of the events show signature properties that suggest that they are likely produced
by propagating shock waves. There are a lot of small-scale dynamic structures detected in the Band
3 data, even though the spatial resolution sets limitations of the size of events that can be detected.
The amount of dynamic signatures in the ALMA mm data is very low in areas with photospheric footpoints
with stronger magnetic fields, which is consistent with the expectation for propagating shock
waves.

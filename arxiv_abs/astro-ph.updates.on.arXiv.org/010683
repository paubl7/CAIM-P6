The work extends the computational model EULAG-MHD to include Hall magnetohydrodynamics (HMHD)---important
to explore physical systems undergoing fast magnetic reconnection at the order of the ion inertial
length scale. Examples include solar transients along with reconnections in magnetosphere, magnetotail
and laboratory plasmas. The paper documents the results of two distinct sets of implicit large-eddy
simulations in the presence and absence of the Hall forcing term, initiated with an unidirectional
sinusoidal magnetic field. The HMHD simulation while benchmarking the code also emphasizes the
complexity of three dimensional (3D) evolution over its two dimensional (2D) counterpart. The
magnetic reconnections onset significantly earlier in HMHD. Importantly, the magnetic field
generated by the Hall term breaks any inherent symmetry, ultimately making the evolution 3D. The
resulting 3D reconnections develop magnetic flux ropes and magnetic flux tubes. Projected on the
reconnection plane, the ropes and tubes appear as magnetic islands, which later break into secondary
islands, and finally coalesce to generate an X-type neutral point. These findings are in agreement
with the theory and contemporary simulations of HMHD, and thus verify our extension of the EULAG-MHD
model. The second set explores the influence of the Hall forcing on generation and ascend of a magnetic
flux rope from sheared magnetic arcades---a novel scenario instructive in understanding the coronal
transients. The rope evolves through intermediate complex structures, ultimately breaking locally
because of reconnections. Interestingly, the breakage occurs earlier in the presence of the Hall
term, signifying faster dynamics leading to magnetic topology favorable for reconnections.

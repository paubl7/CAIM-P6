One of the fundamental properties of an intermediate polar is the dynamical nature of the accretion
flow as it encounters the white dwarf's magnetosphere. Many works have presumed a dichotomy between
disk-fed accretion, in which the WD accretes from a Keplerian disk, and stream-fed accretion, in
which the matter stream from the donor star directly impacts the WD's magnetosphere without forming
a disk. However, there is also a third, poorly understood regime in which the accretion flow consists
of a torus of diamagnetic blobs that encircles the WD. This mode of accretion is expected to exist
at mass-transfer rates below those observed during disk-fed accretion, but above those observed
during pure stream-fed accretion. We invoke the diamagnetic-blob regime to explain the exceptional
TESS light curve of the intermediate polar TX Col, which transitioned into and out of states of enhanced
accretion during Cycles 1 and 3. Power-spectral analysis reveals that the accretion was principally
stream-fed. However, when the mass-transfer rate spiked, large-amplitude quasi-periodic oscillations
(QPOs) abruptly appeared and dominated the light curve for weeks. The QPOs have two striking properties:
they appear in a stream-fed geometry at elevated accretion rates, and they occur preferentially
within a well-defined range of frequencies (~10-25 cycles per day). We propose that during episodes
of enhanced accretion, a torus of diamagnetic blobs forms near the binary's circularization radius
and that the QPOs are beats between the white dwarf's spin frequency and unstable blob orbits within
the WD's magnetosphere. We discuss how such a torus could be a critical step in producing an accretion
disk in a formerly diskless system.

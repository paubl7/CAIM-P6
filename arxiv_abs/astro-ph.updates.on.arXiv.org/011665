We revisit the squeezed-limit non-Gaussianity in the single-field non-attractor inflation models
from the viewpoint of the cosmological soft theorem. In the single-field attractor models, inflaton's
trajectories with different initial conditions effectively converge into a single trajectory
in the phase space, and hence there is only one clock degree of freedom (DoF) in the scalar part. Its
long-wavelength perturbations can be absorbed into the local coordinate renormalization and
lead to the so-called \emph{consistency relation} between $n$- and $(n+1)$-point functions.
On the other hand, if the inflaton dynamics deviates from the attractor behavior, its long-wavelength
perturbations cannot necessarily be absorbed and the consistency relation is expected not to hold
any longer. In this work, we derive a formula for the squeezed bispectrum including the explicit
correction to the consistency relation, as a proof of its violation in the non-attractor cases.
First one must recall that non-attractor inflation needs to be followed by attractor inflation
in a realistic case. Then, even if a specific non-attractor phase is effectively governed by a single
DoF of phase space (represented by the exact ultra-slow-roll limit) and followed by a single-DoF
attractor phase, its transition phase necessarily involves two DoF in dynamics and hence its long-wavelength
perturbations cannot be absorbed into the local coordinate renormalization. Thus, it can affect
local physics, even taking account of the so-called \emph{local observer effect}, as shown by the
fact that the bispectrum in the squeezed limit can go beyond the consistency relation. More concretely,
the observed squeezed bispectrum does not vanish in general for long-wavelength perturbations
exiting the horizon during a non-attractor phase.

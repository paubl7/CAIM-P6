The majority of cataclysmic variables are predicted to be post-period minimum systems with degenerate
donor stars, the period bouncers. Owing to their intrinsic faintness, however, only a handful of
these systems have so far been securely identified. We want to study the X-ray properties of two eclipsing
period bouncers, OV Bootis and SDSS J103533.02+055158.3, that were selected for this study due
to their proximity to Earth. We have obtained XMM-Newton phase-resolved X-ray and ultraviolet
observations of the two objects for spectral and timing analysis. Owing to a recent dwarf nova outburst
OV Boo was much brighter than SDSS J103533.02+055158.3 at X-ray and ultraviolet wavelengths and
the eclipse could be studied in some detail. An updated eclipse ephemeris was derived. The X-rays
were shown to originate close to the white dwarf, the boundary layer, with significant absorption
affecting its spectrum. There was no absorption in SDSS J103533.02+055158.3, despite being observed
at the same inclination indicating different shapes of the disk and the disk rim. The white-dwarf
temperature was re-determined for both objects: the white dwarf in OV Boo was still hot (23,000 K)
five months after a dwarf nova outburst, and the white dwarf in SDSS J103533.02+055158.3 hotter
than assumed previously (Teff = 11,500 K). All three cataclysmic variables with degenerate donors
studied so far in X-rays, including SDSS J121209.31+013627.7, were clearly discovered in X-rays
and revealed mass accretion rates dot(M) >= 8 x 10^(-15) Msun/ yr. If their X-ray behavior is representative
of the subpopulation of period bouncers, the all-sky X-ray surveys with eROSITA together with comprehensive
follow-up will uncover new objects in sufficient number to address the remaining questions concerning
late-stage cataclysmic variable evolution.

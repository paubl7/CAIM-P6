The kinematics of MgII absorbers is the key to understanding the origin of cool, metal-enriched
gas clouds in the circumgalactic medium of massive quiescent galaxies. Exploiting the fact that
the line-of-sight velocity distribution of those clouds is the only unknown for predicting the
redshift-space distortion (RSD) of MgII absorbers from their 3D real-space distribution around
galaxies, we develop a novel method to infer the cool cloud kinematics from the redshift-space galaxy-cloud
cross-correlation function $\xi^{s}$. We measure $\xi^{s}$ for ~$10^4$ MgII absorbers around
a sample of luminous red galaxies at $0.4{<}z{<}0.8$. By comparing with the RSD of galaxies, we discover
that $\xi^{s}$ does not exhibit a strong Fingers-of-God effect, but is heavily truncated at relative
velocity ~$300\,km/s$. We reconstruct both the redshift and real-space cloud number density distributions
for absorbers that reside within the LRG halos, $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ and $\xi_{1h}$, respectively.
Thus, for given model of cloud kinematics, we can predict $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ from the reconstructed
$\xi_{1h}$, and compare to the observed $\xi^{s}_{1h}$ in a self-consistently manner. We consider
four types of cloud kinematics, including an isothermal model with a single velocity dispersion,
a satellite infall model in which cool clouds reside in the subhalos, a cloud accretion model in which
cool clouds follow the cosmic dark matter accretion, and a tired wind model in which cool clouds originate
from the galactic wind-driven bubbles. We find that all the four models provide statistically good
fits to the RSD data, but only the tired wind model can reproduce the observed truncation by propagating
an ancient wind bubble at ~$250\,km/s$ on scales ~$400\,kpc/h$. Our method provides an exciting
path to decoding the dynamical origin of metal absorbers from the small-scale RSD modelling with
upcoming spectroscopic surveys.

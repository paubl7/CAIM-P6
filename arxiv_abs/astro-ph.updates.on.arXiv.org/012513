Context. In exoplanet searches with radial velocity data, the most common statistical significance
metrics are the Bayes factor and the false alarm probability (FAP). Both have proved useful, but
do not directly address whether an exoplanet detection should be claimed. Furthermore, it is unclear
which detection threshold should be taken and how robust the detections are to model misspecification.
Aims. The present work aims at defining a detection criterion which conveys as precisely as possible
the information needed to claim an exoplanet detection. We compare this new criterion to existing
ones in terms of sensitivity and robustness. Methods. We define a significance metric called the
false inclusion probability (FIP) based on the posterior probability of presence of a planet. Posterior
distributions are computed with the nested sampling package Polychord. We show that for FIP and
Bayes factor calculations, defining priors on linear parameters as Gaussian mixture models allows
to significantly speed up computations. The performances of the FAP, Bayes factor and FIP are studied
with simulations as well as analytical arguments. We compare the methods assuming the model is correct,
then evaluate their sensitivity to the prior and likelihood choices. Results. Among other properties,
the FIP offers ways to test the reliability of the significance levels, it is particularly efficient
to account for aliasing and allows to exclude the presence of planets with a certain confidence.
We find that, in our simulations, the FIP outperforms existing detection metrics. We show that planet
detections are sensitive to priors on period and semi-amplitude and that letting free the noise
parameters offers better performances than fixing a noise model based on a fit to ancillary indicators.

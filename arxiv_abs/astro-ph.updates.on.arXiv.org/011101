We carried out observations of the 22 GHz H2O masers in a high-mass protostar S255 NIRS 3 by using VERA.
We measured the proper motions of the 22 GHz H2O masers associated with a bipolar outflow. The expansion
velocity of the blueshifted bow shock traced by the 22 GHz H2O masers was 28 km s-1 corresponding to
a dynamical timescale of 60 years. The direction of the maser outflow is slightly tilted compared
with the radio jet, which could suggest a more recent ejection episode during the accretion burst
event. The total flux density of the 22 GHz H2O masers has gradually increased from early 2017 and
has become almost constant in 2018. For the first time, we reveal extended H2O maser emission at 22
GHz in a star forming region, which is partly resolved out by VERA and even by the most extended VLA
configurations. We find that the flux variation of such an extended component is similar to that
of the unresolved maser emission. We also conducted observations of the submillimeter continuum
and the 321 GHz H2O masers with ALMA at Band 7. The continuum emission does not show significant variations
compared with the previous observations performed 5 months before. We mapped the 321 GHz H2O masers
in S255 NIRS 3 providing the fourth example, for this maser, of the spatial distribution in a high-mass
star-forming region. The lower ratio of the 22 GHz/321 GHz maser luminosity in the blueshifted bow
shock suggests a temperature (>1000 K), higher than for the other maser features in this region.
We conclude that the bow shock structure traced by the 22 GHz H2O maser features is unlikely to be originating
at the interface between the radio jet powered by the recent accretion outburst and the surrounding
medium. The brightening of the 22 GHz H2O masers could be due to radiative excitation by photons form
the infrared outburst escaping along the cavity created by the newly ejected material.

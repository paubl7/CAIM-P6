We study phase shifts of the propagating slow waves in coronal loops invoking the effects of thermal
conductivity, compressive viscosity, radiative losses and heating-cooling imbalance. We derive
a general dispersion relation and solve it to determine the phase shifts of density and temperature
perturbations relative to the velocity and their dependence on the equilibrium parameters ($\rho_0$,
$T_0$). We estimate phase difference ($\Delta \phi$) between density and temperature perturbations
and its dependence on $\rho_0$ and $T_0$. The effect of viscosity on the phase shifts was found negligible.
The role of radiative losses along with h/c imbalance for chosen specific heating function ($H(\rho,
T) \propto \rho^{-0.5} T^{-3}$) in determining phase shifts, is found to be significant for the
high density and low temperature loops. The h/c imbalance can increase the phase difference ($\Delta
\phi \approx 140^\circ$) for low temperature loops compared to the constant heating case ($\Delta
\phi \approx 30^\circ$). We derive a general expression for the polytropic index. We find that in
the presence of thermal conduction alone, the polytropic index remains close to its classical value
for all the considered $\rho_0$ and $T_0$. However, it reduces to a value $1.2$ when loop density
is decreased by an order of magnitude compared to its normal coronal value. We find that the inclusion
of radiative losses, with or without h/c imbalance, cannot explain the observed polytropic index.
The thermal ratio ($d$) needs to be enhanced by an order of magnitude, in order to explain its observed
value $1.1 \pm 0.02$ in the solar loops. We also explore the role of different heating functions for
typical coronal parameters and found that although the polytropic index remains close to its classical
value, the phase difference is highly dependent on the form of heating function (The abstract is
restructured).

We present a supermassive black hole (SMBH) mass measurement in the Seyfert 1 galaxy NGC7469 using
Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of the atomic-${\rm [CI]}$(1-0)
and molecular-$^{12}$CO(1-0) emission lines at the spatial resolution of $\approx0.3$" (or $\approx$
100 pc). These emissions reveal that NGC7469 hosts a circumnuclear gas disc (CND) with a ring-like
structure and a two-arm/bi-symmetric spiral pattern within it, surrounded by a starbursting ring.
The CND has a relatively low $\sigma/V\approx0.35$ ($r\sim0.5$") and $\sim0.19$ ($r>0.5"$),
suggesting that the gas is dynamically settled and suitable for dynamically deriving the mass of
its central source. As is expected from X-ray dominated region (XDR) effects that dramatically
increase an atomic carbon abundance by dissociating CO molecules, we suggest that the atomic [CI](1-0)
emission is a better probe of SMBH masses than CO emission in AGNs. Our dynamical model using the ${\rm
[CI]}$(1-0) kinematics yields a $M_{\rm BH}=1.78^{+2.69}_{-1.10}\times10^7$M$_\odot$ and
$M/L_{\rm F547M}=2.25^{+0.40}_{-0.43}$ (M$_\odot$/L$_\odot$). The model using the CO(1-0)
kinematics also gives a consistent $M_{\rm BH}$ with a larger uncertainty, up to an order of magnitude,
i.e.\ $M_{\rm BH}=1.60^{+11.52}_{-1.45}\times10^7$M$_\odot$. This newly dynamical $M_{\rm
BH}$ is $\approx$ 2 times higher than the mass determined from the reverberation mapped (RM) method
using emissions arising in the unresolved broad-line region (BLR). Given this new $M_{\rm BH}$,
we are able to constrain the specific RM dimensionless scaling factor of $f=7.2^{+4.2}_{-3.4}$
for the AGN BLR in NGC7469. The gas within the unresolved BLR thus has a Keplerian virial velocity
component and the inclination of $i\approx11.0^\circ$$_{-2.5}^{+2.2}$, confirming its face-on
orientation in a Seyfert 1 AGN by assuming a geometrically thin BLR model.

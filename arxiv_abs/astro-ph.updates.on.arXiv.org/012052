We present Quasarnet, a novel research platform that enables deployment of data-driven modeling
techniques for the investigation of the properties of super-massive black holes. Black hole data
sets -- observations and simulations -- have grown rapidly in the last decade in both complexity
and abundance. However, our computational environments and tool sets have not matured commensurately
to exhaust opportunities for discovery with these data. Our pilot study presented here is motivated
by one of the fundamental open questions in understanding black hole formation and assembly across
cosmic time - the nature of the black hole host galaxy and parent dark matter halo connection. To explore
this, we combine and co-locate large, observational data sets of quasars, the high-redshift luminous
population of accreting black holes, at z > 3 alongside simulated data spanning the same cosmic epochs
in Quasarnet. We demonstrate the extraction of the properties of observed quasars and their putative
dark matter parent halos that permit studying their association and correspondence. In this paper,
we describe the design, implementation, and operation of the publicly queryable Quasarnet database
and provide examples of query types and visualizations that can be used to explore the data. Starting
with data collated in Quasarnet, which will serve as training sets, we plan to utilize machine learning
algorithms to predict properties of the as yet undetected, less luminous quasar population. To
that ultimate goal, here we present the first key step in building the BH-galaxy-halo connection
that underpins the formation and evolution of supermassive black holes. All our codes and compiled
data are available on the public Google Kaggle Platform.

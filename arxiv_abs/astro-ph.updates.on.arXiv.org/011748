Measuring the HI-halo mass scaling relation (HIHM) is fundamental to understanding the role of
HI in galaxy formation and its connection to structure formation. While direct measurements of
the HI mass in haloes are possible using HI-spectral stacking, the reported shape of the relation
depends on the techniques used to measure it (e.g. monotonically increasing with mass versus flat,
mass-independent). Using a simulated HI and optical survey produced with the SHARK semi-analytic
galaxy formation model, we investigate how well different observational techniques can recover
the intrinsic, theoretically predicted, HIHM relation. We run a galaxy group finder and mimic the
HI stacking procedure adopted by different surveys and find we can reproduce their observationally
derived HIHM relation. However, none of the adopted techniques recover the underlying HIHM relation
predicted by the simulation. We find that systematic effects in halo mass estimates of galaxy groups
modify the inferred shape of the HIHM relation from the intrinsic one in the simulation, while contamination
by interloping galaxies, not associated with the groups, contribute to the inferred HI mass of a
halo mass bin, when using large velocity windows for stacking. The effect of contamination is maximal
at Mvir~10^(12-12.5)Msol. Stacking methods based on summing the HI emission spectra to infer the
mean HI mass of galaxies of different properties belonging to a group suffer minimal contamination
but are strongly limited by the use of optical counterparts, which miss the contribution of dwarf
galaxies. Deep spectroscopic surveys will provide significant improvements by going deeper while
maintaining high spectroscopic completeness; for example, the WAVES survey will recover ~52%
of the total HI mass of the groups with Mvir~10^(14)Msol compared to ~21% in GAMA.

The minor planets on orbits that are dynamically stable in Neptune's 1:1 resonance on Gyr timescales
were likely emplaced by Neptune's outward migration. We explore the intrinsic libration amplitude,
eccentricity, and inclination distribution of Neptune's stable Trojans, using the detections
and survey efficiency of the Outer Solar System Origins Survey (OSSOS) and Pan-STARRS1. We find
that the libration amplitude of the stable Neptunian Trojan population can be well modeled as a Rayleigh
distribution with a libration amplitude width $\sigma_{A_phi}$ of 15$^\circ$. When taken as a
whole, the Neptune Trojan population can be acceptably modeled with a Rayleigh eccentricity distribution
of width $\sigma_e$ of 0.045 and a typical sin(i) x Gaussian inclination distribution with a width
$\sigma_i$ of 14 +/- 2 degrees. However, these distributions are only marginally acceptable. This
is likely because, even after accounting for survey detection biases, the known large Hr < 8 and small
Hr >= 8 Neptune Trojans appear to have markedly different eccentricities and inclinations. We propose
that like the classical Kuiper belt, the stable intrinsic Neptunian Trojan population have dynamically
`hot' and dynamically `cold' components to its eccentricity/inclination distribution, with
$\sigma_{e-cold}$ ~ 0.02 / $\sigma_{i-cold}$ ~ 6$^\circ$ and $\sigma_{e-hot}$~ 0.05 / $\sigma_{i-hot}$
~ 18$^\circ$. In this scenario, the `cold' L4 Neptunian Trojan population lacks the Hr >= 8 members
and has 13 +11/-6 `cold' Trojans with Hr < 8. On the other hand, the `hot' L4 Neptunian Trojan population
has 136 +57/-48 Trojans with Hr < 10 -- a population 2.4 times greater than that of the L4 Jovian Trojans
in the same luminosity range.

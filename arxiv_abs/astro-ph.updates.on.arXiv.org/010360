The next generation of data-intensive surveys are bound to produce a vast amount of data, which can
be dealt with using machine-learning methods to explore possible correlations within the multi-dimensional
parameter space. We explore the classification capabilities of convolution neural networks (CNNs)
to identify galaxy cluster members (CLMs) by using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images of 15 galaxy
clusters at redshift 0.19<z<0.60, observed as part of the CLASH and Hubble Frontier Field programmes.
We used extensive spectroscopic information, based on the CLASH-VLT VIMOS programme combined
with MUSE observations, to define the knowledge base. We performed various tests to quantify how
well CNNs can identify cluster members on the basis of imaging information only. We investigated
the CNN capability to predict source memberships outside the training coverage, by identifying
CLMs at the faint end of the magnitude distributions. We find that the CNNs achieve a purity-completeness
rate ~90%, demonstrating stable behaviour, along with a remarkable generalisation capability
with respect to cluster redshifts. We concluded that if extensive spectroscopic information is
available as a training base, the proposed approach is a valid alternative to catalogue-based methods
because it has the advantage of avoiding photometric measurements, which are particularly challenging
and time-consuming in crowded cluster cores. As a byproduct, we identified 372 photometric CLMs,
with mag(F814)<25, to complete the sample of 812 spectroscopic CLMs in four galaxy clusters RX~J2248-4431,
MACS~J0416-2403, MACS~J1206-0847 and MACS~J1149+2223. When this technique is applied to the
data that are expected to become available from forthcoming surveys, it will be an efficient tool
for a variety of studies requiring CLM selection, such as galaxy number densities, luminosity functions,
and lensing mass reconstruction.

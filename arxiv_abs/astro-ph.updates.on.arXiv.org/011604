The past decade has seen impressive progress in the detection of $z>7$ galaxies with the Hubble Space
Telescope, however little is known about their properties. The James Webb Space Telescope will
revolutionise the high-$z$ field by providing NIR (i.e., rest-frame optical) data of unprecedented
depth and spatial resolution. Measuring galaxy quantities such as resolved stellar ages or gas
metallicity gradients traditionally requires spectroscopy, as broad-band imaging filters are
generally too coarse to fully isolate diagnostics such as the 4000 \r{A} (rest-frame) break, continuum
emission from aged stars, and key emission lines (e.g., [OII], [OIII], H$\beta$). However, in this
paper, we show that adding NIRCam images through a strategically chosen medium-band filter to common
wide-band filters sets adopted by ERS and GTO programs delivers tighter constraints on these galactic
properties. To constrain the choice of filter, we perform a systematic investigation of which combinations
of wide-band filters from ERS and GTO programs and single medium-band filters offer the tightest
constraints on several galaxy properties at redshifts $z\sim7-11$. We employ the JAGUAR extragalactic
catalogs to construct statistical samples of physically-motivated mock photometry and conduct
SED-fitting procedures to evaluate the accuracy of galaxy property (and photo-$z$) recovery with
a simple star-formation history model. We find that adding $>4.1 \mu$m medium filters at comparable
depth to the broad-band filters can significantly improve photo-$z$s and yield close to order-of-magnitude
improvements in the determination of quantities such as stellar ages, metallicities, SF-related
quantities and emission line fluxes at $z\sim8$. For resolved sources, the proposed approach enables
spatially-resolved determination of these quantities that would be prohibitive with slit spectroscopy.

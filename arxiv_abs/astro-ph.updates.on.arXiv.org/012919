We present a detailed analysis of an eruptive event that occurred on early 2019 March 8 in active region
AR 12734, to which we refer as the International Women's day event. The event under study is intriguing
in several aspects: 1) low-coronal eruptive signatures come in ''pairs'' (a double-peak flare,
two coronal dimmings, and two EUV waves); 2) although the event is characterized by a complete chain
of eruptive signatures, the corresponding coronagraphic signatures are weak; 3) although the
source region of the eruption is located close to the center of the solar disc and the eruption is thus
presumably Earth-directed, heliospheric signatures are very weak with little Earth-impact.
We analyze a number of multi-spacecraft and multi-instrument (both remote-sensing and in situ)
observations, including Soft X-ray, (extreme-) ultraviolet (E)UV), radio and white-light emission,
as well as plasma, magnetic field and particle measurements. We employ 3D NLFF modeling to investigate
the coronal magnetic field configuration in and around the active region, the GCS model to make a
3D reconstruction of the CME geometry and the 3D MHD numerical model EUHFORIA to model the background
state of the heliosphere. Our results indicate two subsequent eruptions of two systems of sheared
and twisted magnetic fields, which merge already in the upper corona and start to evolve further
out as a single entity. The large-scale magnetic field significantly influences both, the early
and the interplanetary evolution of the structure. During the first eruption the stability of the
overlying field was disrupted which enabled the second eruption. We find that during the propagation
in the interplanetary space the large-scale magnetic field, i.e. , the location of heliospheric
current sheet between the AR and the Earth likely influences propagation and the evolution of the
erupted structure(s).

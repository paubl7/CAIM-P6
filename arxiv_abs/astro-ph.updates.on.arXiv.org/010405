Massive outflows of neutral atomic hydrogen (HI) have been observed in absorption in a number of
radio galaxies and are considered a signature of AGN feedback. These outflows on kpc-scales have
not been investigated in great detail as they require high-angular resolution observations to
be spatially resolved. In some radio AGN, they are likely the result of the radio jets interacting
with the interstellar medium. We have used a global VLBI array to map the HI outflow in a small sample
of young and restarted radio galaxies which we previously observed with the VLA and the WSRT at lower
resolution. Here, we report on our findings for 4C52.37 and 3C293 and we discuss the sample including
the previously published sources 4C12.50 and 3C236. For 4C52.37, we present the first-ever HI VLBI
observation which recovered the majority of the outflowing HI gas in form of clouds towards the central
100pc of the AGN. The clouds are blue-shifted by up to 600km/s with respect to the systemic velocity.
3C293 is largely resolved out in our VLBI observation, but we detect, towards the VLBI core, some
outflowing HI gas blueshifted with respect to the systemic velocity by up to 300km/s. We also find
indications that the HI outflow is extended. Overall, we find that the fraction of HI gas recovered
by our VLBI observation varies significantly within our sample. In all cases we find evidence for
a clumpy structure of both the outflowing and the quiescent gas, consistent with predictions from
numerical simulations. The outflows include at least a component of relatively compact clouds
(10^4-10^5Msun) often observed already at a few tens of pc (in projection) from the core. We also
find indications that the HI outflow might have a diffuse component, especially in larger sources.
Our results support the interpretation that we observe these AGNs at different stages in the evolution
of the jet-ISM interaction.

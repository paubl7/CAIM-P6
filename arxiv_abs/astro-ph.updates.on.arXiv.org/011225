Yearslong time series of high-precision brightness measurements have been assembled for thousands
of stars with telescopes operating in space. Such data have allowed astronomers to measure the physics
of stellar interiors via nonradial oscillations, opening a new avenue to study the stars in the Universe.
Asteroseismology, the interpretation of the characteristics of oscillation modes in terms of
the physical properties of the stellar interior, brought entirely new insights in how stars rotate
and how they build up their chemistry throughout their evolution. Data-driven space asteroseismology
delivered a drastic increase in the reliability of computer models mimicking the evolution of stars
born with a variety of masses and metallicities. Such models are critical ingredients for modern
physics as a whole, because they are used throughout various contemporary and multidisciplinary
research fields in space science, including the search for life outside the solar system, archaeological
studies of the Milky Way, and the study of single and binary supernova progenitors, among which are
future gravitational wave sources. The specific role and potential of asteroseismology for those
modern research fields are illustrated. The review concludes with current limitations of asteroseismology
and highlights how they can be overcome with ongoing and future large infrastructures for survey
astronomy combined with new theoretical research in the era of high-performance computing. This
review presents results obtained through major community efforts over the past decade. These breakthroughs
were achieved in a collaborative and inclusive spirit that is characteristic of the asteroseismology
community. The review's aim is to make this research field accessible to graduate students and readers
coming from other fields of physics, with incentives to join future applications in this domain
of astrophysics.

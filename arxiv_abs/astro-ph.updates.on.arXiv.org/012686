We present the discovery of J22564-5910, a new type of hot subdwarf (sdB) which shows evidence of
gas present in the system and has shallow, multi-peaked hydrogen and helium lines which vary in shape
over time. All observational evidence points towards J22564-5910 being observed very shortly
after the merger phase that formed it. Using high-resolution, high signal-to-noise spectroscopy,
combined with multi-band photometry, Gaia astrometry, and TESS light curves, we aim to interpret
these unusual spectral features. The photometry, spectra and light curves are all analyzed, and
their results are combined in order to support our interpretation of the observations: the likely
presence of a magnetic field combined with gas features around the sdB. Based on the triple-peaked
H lines, the magnetic field strength is estimated and, by using the shellspec code, qualitative
models of gas configurations are fitted to the observations. All observations can either be explained
by a magnetic field of ~650 kG which enables the formation of a centrifugal magnetosphere, or a non-magnetic
hot subdwarf surrounded by a circumstellar gas disk/torus. Both scenarios are not mutually exclusive
and both can be explained by a recent merger. J22564-5910 is the first object of its kind. It is a rapidly
spinning sdB with gas still present in the system. It is the first post-merger star observed this
early after the merger event, and as such is very valuable system to test merger theories. If the magnetic
field can be confirmed, it is not only the first magnetic sdB, but it hosts the strongest magnetic
field ever found in a pre-white dwarf object. Thus, it could represent the long-sought for immediate
ancestor of strongly magnetic WDs.

Hot massive stars present strong stellar winds that are driven by absorption, scattering and re\-emission
of photons by the ions of the atmosphere (\textit{line-driven winds}). A better comprehension
of this phenomenon, and a more accurate calculation of hydrodynamics and radiative acceleration
is required to reduce the number of free parameters in spectral fitting, to determine accurate wind
parameters such as mass-loss rates and velocity profiles. We use the non-LTE model-atmosphere
code CMFGEN to numerically solve the radiative transfer equation in the stellar atmosphere and
to calculate the radiative acceleration $g_\text{rad}(r)$. Under the assumption that the radiative
acceleration depends only on the radial coordinate, we solve analytically the equation of motion
by means of the Lambert $W$-function. An iterative procedure between the solution of the radiative
transfer and the equation of motion is executed in order to obtain a final self-consistent velocity
field that is no longer based on any $\beta$-law. We apply the Lambert-procedure to three O supergiant
stars ($\zeta$-Puppis, HD~165763 and $\alpha$-Cam) and discuss the Lambert-solutions for the
velocity profiles. It is found that, even without recalculation of the mass-loss rate, the Lambert-procedure
allows the calculation of consistent velocity profiles that reduce the number of free parameters
when a spectral fitting using CMFGEN is performed. Synthetic spectra calculated from our Lambert-solutions
show significant differences compared to the initial $\beta$-law CMFGEN models. The results indicate
the importance of consistent velocity profile calculation in the CMFGEN code and its usage in a fitting
procedure and interpretation of observed spectra.

Trojans are defined as objects that share the orbit of a planet at the stable Lagrangian points $L_4$
and $L_5$. In the Solar System, these bodies show a broad size distribution ranging from micrometer($\mu$m)
to centimeter(cm) particles (Trojan dust) and up to kilometer (km) rocks (Trojan asteroids). It
has also been theorized that earth-like Trojans may be formed in extra-solar systems. The Trojan
formation mechanism is still under debate, especially theories involving the effects of dissipative
forces from a viscous gaseous environment. We perform hydro-simulations to follow the evolution
of a protoplanetary disk with an embedded 1--10 Jupiter-mass planet. On top of the gaseous disk,
we set a distribution of $\mu$m--cm dust particles interacting with the gas. This allows us to follow
dust dynamics as solids get trapped around the Lagrangian points of the planet. We show that large
vortices generated at the Lagrangian points are responsible for dust accumulation, where the leading
Lagrangian point $L_4$ traps a larger amount of submillimeter (submm) particles than the trailing
$L_5$, which traps mostly mm--cm particles. However, the total bulk mass, with typical values of
$\sim M_{\rm moon}$, is more significant in $L_5$ than in $L_4$, in contrast to what is observed in
the current Solar System a few gigayears later. Furthermore, the migration of the planet does not
seem to affect the reported asymmetry between $L_4$ and $L_5$. The main initial mass reservoir for
Trojan dust lies in the same co-orbital path of the planet, while dust migrating from the outer region
(due to drag) contributes very little to its final mass, imposing strong mass constraints for the
in situ formation scenario of Trojan planets.

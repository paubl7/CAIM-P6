Exotic electromagnetic energy injection in the early Universe may alter cosmological recombination,
and ultimately cosmic microwave background (CMB) anisotropies. Moreover, if energy injection
is inhomogeneous, it may induce a spatially-varying ionization fraction, and non-Gaussianity
in the CMB. The observability of these signals, however, is contingent upon how far the injected
particles propagate and deposit their energy into the primordial plasma, relative to the characteristic
scale of energy injection fluctuations. In this study we inspect the spatial properties of energy
deposition and perturbed recombination resulting from an inhomogeneous energy injection of sub-10
MeV photons, relevant to accreting primordial black holes (PBHs). We develop a novel Monte-Carlo
radiation transport code accounting for all relevant photon interactions in this energy range,
and including secondary electron energy deposition efficiency through a new analytic approximation.
For a specified injected photon spectrum, the code outputs an injection-to-deposition Green's
function depending on time and distance from the injection point. Combining this output with a linearized
solution of the perturbed recombination problem, we derive time- and scale-dependent deposition-to-ionization
Green's functions. We apply this general framework to accreting PBHs, whose luminosity is strongly
spatially modulated by supersonic relative velocities between cold dark matter and baryons. We
find that the resulting spatial fluctuations of the free-electron fraction are of the same magnitude
as its mean deviation from standard recombination, from which current CMB power spectra constraints
are derived. This work suggests that the sensitivity to accreting PBHs might be substantially improved
by propagating these inhomogeneities to CMB anisotropy power spectra and non-Gaussian statistics,
which we study in subsequent papers.

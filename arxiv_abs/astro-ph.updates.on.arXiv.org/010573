Planck Galactic Cold Clumps (PGCCs) are contemplated to be the ideal targets to probe the early phases
of star formation. We have conducted a survey of 72 young dense cores inside PGCCs in the Orion complex
with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) at 1.3\,mm (band 6) using three different
configurations (resolutions $\sim$ 0$\farcs$35, 1$\farcs$0, and 7$\farcs$0) to statistically
investigate their evolutionary stages and sub-structures. We have obtained images of the 1.3\,mm
continuum and molecular line emission ($^{12}$CO, and SiO) at an angular resolution of $\sim$ 0$\farcs$35
($\sim$ 140\,au) with the combined arrays. We find 70 substructures within 48 detected dense cores
with median dust-mass $\sim$ 0.093\,M$_{\sun}$ and deconvolved size $\sim$ 0$\farcs$27. Dense
substructures are clearly detected within the central 1000\,au of four candidate prestellar cores.
The sizes and masses of the substructures in continuum emission are found to be significantly reduced
with protostellar evolution from Class\,0 to Class\,I. We also study the evolutionary change in
the outflow characteristics through the course of protostellar mass accretion. A total of 37 sources
exhibit CO outflows, and 20 ($>$50\%) show high-velocity jets in SiO. The CO velocity-extents ($\Delta$Vs)
span from 4 to 110 km/s with outflow cavity opening angle width at 400\,au ranging from $[\Theta_{obs}]_{400}$
$\sim$ 0$\farcs$6 to 3$\farcs$9, which corresponds to 33$\fdg$4$-$125$\fdg$7. For the majority
of the outflow sources, the $\Delta$Vs show a positive correlation with $[\Theta_{obs}]_{400}$,
suggesting that as protostars undergo gravitational collapse, the cavity opening of a protostellar
outflow widens and the protostars possibly generate more energetic outflows.

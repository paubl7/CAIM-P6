[Abridged] Context: We present a systematic X-ray spectral-timing study of the recently discovered,
exceptionally bright black hole X-ray binary system MAXI J1820+070. Our analysis focuses on the
first part of the 2018 outburst, covering the rise throughout the hard state, the bright hard and
hard-intermediate states, and the transition to the soft-intermediate state. Aims: We address
the issue of constraining the geometry of the innermost accretion flow and its evolution throughout
an outburst. Methods: We employed two independent X-ray spectral-timing methods applied to the
NICER data of MAXI J1820+070. We first identified and tracked the evolution of a characteristic
frequency of soft X-ray reverberation lags. Then, we studied the spectral evolution of the quasi-thermal
component responsible for the observed thermal reverberation lags. Results: The frequency of
thermal reverberation lags steadily increases throughout most of the outburst, implying that
the relative distance between the X-ray source and the disc decreases as the source softens. However,
near transition this evolution breaks, showing a sudden increase (decrease) of lag amplitude (frequency).
The temperature of the quasi-thermal component in covariance spectra consistently increases
throughout all the analysed observations. Conclusions: The behaviour of thermal reverberation
lags near transition might be related to the relativistic plasma ejections detected at radio wavelengths,
suggesting a causal connection between the two phenomena. Throughout most of the hard and hard-intermediate
states the disc is consistent with being truncated (with an inner radius $R_{\rm in}>\sim 10 R_{\rm
g}$), reaching close to the innermost stable circular orbit only near transition.

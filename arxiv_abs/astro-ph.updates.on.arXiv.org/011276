The magnetic activity of the Sun directly impacts the Earth and human life. Likewise, other stars
will have an impact on the habitability of planets orbiting these host stars. The lack of information
on the magnetic field in the higher atmospheric layers hampers our progress in understanding solar
magnetic activity. Overcoming this limitation would allow us to address four paramount long-standing
questions: (1) How does the magnetic field couple the different layers of the atmosphere, and how
does it transport energy? (2) How does the magnetic field structure, drive and interact with the
plasma in the chromosphere and upper atmosphere? (3) How does the magnetic field destabilise the
outer solar atmosphere and thus affect the interplanetary environment? (4) How do magnetic processes
accelerate particles to high energies? New ground-breaking observations are needed to address
these science questions. We suggest a suite of three instruments that far exceed current capabilities
in terms of spatial resolution, light-gathering power, and polarimetric performance: (a) A large-aperture
UV-to-IR telescope of the 1-3 m class aimed mainly to measure the magnetic field in the chromosphere
by combining high spatial resolution and high sensitivity. (b) An extreme-UV-to-IR coronagraph
that is designed to measure the large-scale magnetic field in the corona with an aperture of about
40 cm. (c) An extreme-UV imaging polarimeter based on a 30 cm telescope that combines high throughput
in the extreme UV with polarimetry to connect the magnetic measurements of the other two instruments.
This mission to measure the magnetic field will unlock the driver of the dynamics in the outer solar
atmosphere and thereby greatly advance our understanding of the Sun and the heliosphere.

Point-spread function (PSF) estimation in spatially undersampled images is challenging because
large pixels average fine-scale spatial information. This is problematic when fine-resolution
details are necessary, as in optimal photometry where knowledge of the illumination pattern beyond
the native spatial resolution of the image may be required. Here, we introduce a method of PSF reconstruction
where point sources are artificially sampled beyond the native resolution of an image and combined
together via stacking to return a finely sampled estimate of the PSF. This estimate is then deconvolved
from the pixel-gridding function to return a superresolution kernel that can be used for optimally
weighted photometry. We benchmark against the < 1% photometric error requirement of the upcoming
SPHEREx mission to assess performance in a concrete example. We find that standard methods like
Richardson--Lucy deconvolution are not sufficient to achieve this stringent requirement. We
investigate a more advanced method with significant heritage in image analysis called iterative
back-projection (IBP) and demonstrate it using idealized Gaussian cases and simulated SPHEREx
images. In testing this method on real images recorded by the LORRI instrument on New Horizons, we
are able to identify systematic pointing drift. Our IBP-derived PSF kernels allow photometric
accuracy significantly better than the requirement in individual SPHEREx exposures. This PSF
reconstruction method is broadly applicable to a variety of problems and combines computationally
simple techniques in a way that is robust to complicating factors such as severe undersampling,
spatially complex PSFs, noise, crowded fields, or limited source numbers.

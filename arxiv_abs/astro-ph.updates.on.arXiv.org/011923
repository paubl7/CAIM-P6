The abundances of n-capture elements in the CEMP-r/s stars agree with predictions of intermediate
n-density nucleosynthesis, at $N_\mathrm{n}\sim 10^{13}$-$10^{15} \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$, in
rapidly-accreting white dwarfs (RAWDs). We have performed Monte-Carlo simulations of this i-process
nucleosynthesis to determine the impact of (n,$\gamma$) reaction rate uncertainties of 164 unstable
isotopes, from $^{131}$I to $^{189}$Hf, on the predicted abundances of 18 elements from Ba to W.
The impact study is based on two representative one-zone models with constant values of $N_\mathrm{n}
= 3.16\times 10^{14}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$ and $N_\mathrm{n} = 3.16\times 10^{13}\ \mathrm{cm}^{-3}$
and on a multi-zone model based on a realistic stellar evolution simulation of He-shell convection
entraining H in a RAWD model with [Fe/H]=-2.6. For each of the selected elements, we have identified
up to two (n,$\gamma$) reactions having the strongest correlations between their rate variations
constrained by Hauser-Feshbach computations and the predicted abundances, with the Pearson product-moment
correlation coefficients $|r_\mathrm{P}| > 0.15$. We find that the discrepancies between the
predicted and observed abundances of Ba and Pr in the CEMP-i star CS31062-050 are significantly
diminished if the rate of $^{137}$Cs(n,$\gamma)^{138}$Cs is reduced and the rates of $^{141}$Ba(n,$\gamma)^{142}$Ba
or $^{141}$La(n,$\gamma)^{142}$La increased. The uncertainties of temperature-dependent
$\beta$-decay rates of the same unstable isotopes have a negligible effect on the predicted abundances.
One-zone Monte-Carlo simulations can be used instead of computationally time-consuming multi-zone
Monte-Carlo simulations in reaction rate uncertainty studies if they use comparable values of
$N_\mathrm{n}$ (abridged).

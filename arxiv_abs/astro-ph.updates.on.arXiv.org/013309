The MAMMOTH-Grism slitless spectroscopic survey is a Hubble Space Telescope (HST) cycle-28 medium
program, which is obtaining 45 orbits of WFC3/IR grism spectroscopy in the density peak regions
of three massive galaxy protoclusters at $z=2-3$ discovered using the MAMMOTH technique. We introduce
this survey by presenting the first measurement of mass-metallicity relation (MZR) at high redshift
in overdense environments via grism spectroscopy. From the completed MAMMOTH-Grism observation
in the field of the BOSS1244 protocluster at $z=2.24\pm0.02$, We secure a sample of 36 protocluster
member galaxies at $z\sim2.24$, showing strong nebular emission lines ([O III], H$\beta$ and [O
II]) in their G141 spectra. Using the multi-wavelength broad-band deep imaging from HST and ground-based
telescopes, we measure their stellar masses in the range of $[10^{9},10^{10.4}]M_\odot$, instantaneous
star formation rates (SFR) from 10 to 240$M_\odot yr^{-1}$, and global gas-phase metallicities
[1/3,1] of solar. Compared with similarly selected field galaxy sample at the same redshift, our
galaxies show on average increased SFRs by ~0.06dex and ~0.18dex at ~10$^{10.1}M_\odot$ and ~10$^{9.8}M_\odot$,
respectively. Using the stacked spectra of our sample galaxies, we derive the MZR in the BOSS1244
protocluster core as $12+\log({\rm O/H})=(0.136\pm0.018)\times\log(M_\ast/M_\odot)+(7.082\pm0.175)$,
showing significantly shallower slope than that in the field. This shallow MZR slope is likely caused
by the combined effects of efficient recycling of feedback-driven winds and cold-mode gas accretion
in protocluster environments. The former effect helps low-mass galaxies residing in overdensities
retain their metal production, whereas the latter effect dilutes the metal content of high-mass
galaxies, making them more metal poor than their coeval field counterparts.

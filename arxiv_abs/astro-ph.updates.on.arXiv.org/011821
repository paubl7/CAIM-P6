We present a study of the Corona Borealis (CB) supercluster. We determined the high-density cores
of the CB and the richest galaxy clusters in them, and studied their dynamical state and galaxy content.
We determined filaments in the supercluster to analyse the connectivity of clusters. We compared
the mass distribution in the CB with predictions from the spherical collapse model and analysed
the acceleration field in the CB. We found that at a radius $R_{\mathrm{30}}$ around clusters in
the CB (A2065, A2061, A2089, and Gr2064) (corresponding to the density contrast $\Delta\rho \approx
30$), the galaxy distribution shows a minimum. The $R_{30}$ values for individual clusters lie
in the range of $3 - 6$ $h^{-1}$ Mpc. The radii of the clusters (splashback radii) lie in the range of
$R_{\mathrm{cl}} \approx 2 - 3$ $R_{\mathrm{vir}}$. The projected phase space diagrams and the
comparison with the spherical collapse model suggest that $R_{\mathrm{30}}$ regions have passed
turnaround and are collapsing. Galaxy content in clusters varies strongly. The cluster A2061 has
the highest fraction of galaxies with old stellar populations, and A2065 has the highest fraction
of galaxies with young stellar populations. The number of long filaments near clusters vary from
one at A2089 to five at A2061. During the future evolution, the clusters in the main part of the CB may
merge and form one of the largest bound systems in the nearby Universe. Another part of the CB, with
the cluster Gr2064, will form a separate system. The structures with a current density contrast
$\Delta\rho \approx 30$ have passed turnaround and started to collapse at redshifts $z \approx
0.3 - 0.4$. The comparison of the number and properties of the most massive collapsing supercluster
cores from observations and simulations may serve as a test for cosmological models.

We analyzed the sunspot-group daily data that were reported by Greenwich Photoheliogrphic Results
(GPR) during the period 1874-1976 and Debrecen Photoheliographic Data (DPD) during the period
1977-2017. We determined the equatorial rotation rate [A] and the latitude gradient [B] components
of the solar differential rotation by fitting the data in each of the 3-year moving time intervals
(3-year MTIs) successively shifted by one year during the period 1874-2017 to the standard law of
differential rotation. The values of A and B around the years of maxima and minima of Solar Cycles
12-24 are obtained from the 3-year MTIs series of A and B and studied the long-term cycle-to-cycle
modulations in these coefficients. Here we have used the epochs of the maxima and minima of Solar
Cycles 12-24 that were recently determined from the revised Version-2 international sunspot-number
series. We find that there exits a considerably significant secular decreasing-trend in A around
the maxima of solar cycles. There exist no secular trends in both A and B around the minima of solar
cycles. The secular trend in B around the maxima of solar cycles is also found to be statistically
insignificant. We fitted a cosine function to the values of A, and also to those of B, after removing
the corresponding linear trends. The cosine-fits suggest that there exist ~54-year (~94-year)
and ~82-year (~79-year) periodicities in A (B) around the maxima and minima of solar cycles, respectively.
The amplitude of the cosine-profile of A (B) around the minima of solar cycles is about 41% (65%) larger
than that of A (B) around the maxima. In addition, the cosine profiles of A and B suggest a large (up
to 180 degree) phase difference between the long-term variations of A, and also between those of
B, around maxima and minima of solar cycles.

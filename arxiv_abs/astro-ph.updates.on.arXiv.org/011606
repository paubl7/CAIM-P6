Deuteration has been used as a tracer of the evolutionary phases of low- and high-mass star formation.
The APEX Telescope Large Area Survey (ATLASGAL) provides an important repository for a detailed
statistical study of massive star-forming clumps in the inner Galactic disc at different evolutionary
phases. We study the amount of deuteration using NH2D in a representative sample of high-mass clumps
discovered by the ATLASGAL survey covering various evolutionary phases of massive star formation.
Unbiased spectral line surveys at 3 mm were thus conducted towards ATLASGAL clumps between 85 and
93 GHz with the Mopra telescope and from 84 to 115 GHz using the IRAM 30m telescope. A subsample was
followed up in the NH2D transition at 74 GHz with the IRAM 30m telescope. We determined the deuterium
fractionation from the column density ratio of NH2D and NH3 and measured the NH2D excitation temperature
for the first time from the simultaneous modelling of the 74 and 110 GHz line using MCWeeds. We find
a large range of the NH2D to NH3 column density ratio up to 1.6+/-0.7 indicating a high degree of NH3
deuteration in a subsample of the clumps. Our analysis yields a clear difference between NH3 and
NH2D rotational temperatures for a fraction of the sources. We therefore advocate observation
of the NH2D transitions at 74 and 110 GHz simultaneously to determine the NH2D temperature directly.
We determine a median ortho-to-para column density ratio of 3.7+/-1.2. The high detection rate
of NH2D confirms a high deuteration previously found in massive star-forming clumps. Using the
excitation temperature of NH2D instead of NH3 is needed to avoid an overestimation of deuteration.
We measure a higher detection rate of NH2D in sources at early evolutionary stages. The deuterium
fractionation shows no correlation with evolutionary tracers such as the NH3 (1,1) line width,
or rotational temperature.

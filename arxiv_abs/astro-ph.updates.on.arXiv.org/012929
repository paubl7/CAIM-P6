Direct measurements of the masses of supermassive black holes (SMBHs) are key to understanding
their growth and constrain their symbiotic relationship to their host galaxies. However, current
methods used to directly measure black hole masses in active quasars become challenging or impossible
beyond $z\gtrsim0.2$. Spectroastrometry (SA) measures the spatial centroid of an object's spectrum
as a function of wavelength, delivering angular resolution far better than PSF for high signal-to-noise
ratio observations. We observed the luminous quasar SDSS J212329.47--005052.9 at $z=2.279$ with
the aim of resolving its $\sim100\mu\mathrm{as}$ H$\alpha$ broad emission line region (BLR),
and present the first SA constraints on the size and kinematic structure of the BLR. Using a novel
pipeline to extract the SA signal and reliable uncertainties, we achieved a centroiding precision
of $\simeq100\mu\mathrm{as}$, or $>2000\times$ smaller than the $K$-band AO-corrected PSF,
yielding a tentative $3.2\sigma$ detection of an SA signal from the BLR. Modeling the BLR emission
as arising from an inclined rotating disk with a mixture of coherent and random motions we constrain
$r_\mathrm{BLR}=454^{+565}_{-162}\,\mu\mathrm{as}$ ($3.71^{+4.65}_{-1.28}\,\mathrm{pc}$),
providing a $95\%$ confidence upper limit on the black hole mass $M_\mathrm{BH}\,\sin^2\,i \leq1.8
\times10^9\,\mathrm{M}_\odot$. Our results agree with the $r_\mathrm{BLR}-L$ relation measured
for lower-$z$ quasars, but expands its dynamic range by an order of magnitude in luminosity. We did
not detect the potentially stronger SA signal from the narrow line region, but discuss in detail
why it may be absent. Already with existing instrumentation, SA can deliver $\sim6\times$ smaller
uncertainties ($\sim15\,\mu\mathrm{as}$) than achieved here, enabling $\sim10\%$ measurements
of SMBH masses in high-$z$ quasars.

The NANOGrav Collaboration found strong Bayesian evidence for a common-spectrum stochastic process
in its 12.5-yr pulsar timing array (PTA) dataset, with median characteristic strain amplitude
at periods of a year of $A_{\rm yr} = 1.92^{+0.75}_{-0.55} \times 10^{-15}$. However, evidence
for the quadrupolar Hellings & Downs interpulsar correlations, which are characteristic of gravitational
wave (GW) signals, was not yet significant. We emulate and extend the NANOGrav dataset, injecting
a wide range of stochastic gravitational wave background (GWB) signals that encompass a variety
of amplitudes and spectral shapes. We then apply our standard detection pipeline and explore three
key astrophysical milestones: (I) robust detection of the GWB; (II) determination of the source
of the GWB; and (III) measurement of the properties of the GWB spectrum. Given the amplitude measured
in the 12.5 yr analysis and assuming this signal is a GWB, we expect to accumulate robust evidence
of an interpulsar-correlated GWB signal with 15--17 yrs of data. At the initial detection, we expect
a fractional uncertainty of 40% on the power-law strain spectrum slope, which is sufficient to distinguish
a GWB of supermassive black-hole binary origin from some models predicting primordial or cosmic-string
origins. Similarly, the measured GWB amplitude will have an uncertainty of 44% upon initial detection,
allowing us to arbitrate between some population models of supermassive black-hole binaries.
In general, however, power-law models are distinguishable from those having low-frequency spectral
turnovers once 20yrs of data are reached. Even though our study is based on the NANOGrav data, we also
derive relations that allow for a generalization to other PTA datasets. Most notably, by combining
individual PTA's data into the International Pulsar Timing Array, all of these milestones can be
reached significantly earlier.

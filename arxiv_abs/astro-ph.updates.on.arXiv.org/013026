The Spectrum-Roentgen-Gamma (SRG) observatory is currently conducting its 4-year all-sky X-ray
survey, which started on December 12, 2019. The survey is periodically interrupted for technological
operations with the spacecraft. These time intervals are usually used by the Mikhail Pavlinsky
ART-XC telescope to perform calibrations. A number of objects of different nature have been targeted.
In particular, SRG carried out scanning observations of the Puppis A supernova remnant (SNR) with
the aim to check the imaging performance of ART-XC and to optimize the technique of image reconstruction
for very extended objects having an angular size larger than the telescope field of view (36' in diameter).
Using the unique imaging capabilities of ART-XC, we attempted to investigate the morphology of
this supernova remnant at energies >4 keV. The region of the Puppis A SNR was observed in 2019 and 2020
with SRG/ART-XC, conducting 1.5 x 1.5 degrees shallow surveys with a total exposure of 36 hours,
which resulted in a highly uniform survey of this region at energies of 4-12 keV. Additional deep
pointed observations of the central part of Puppis A were carried out in 2021 with the total exposure
of 31 hours to highlight the morphology of the extended emission. The X-ray emission of the Puppis
A SNR was significantly detected as an extended structure in the 4-6 keV energy band. The morphology
of the emission is in general agreement with that observed in soft X-rays previously. The deep sky
image of Puppis A obtained with the ART-XC telescope is characterized by a contrast SNR shell rim,
an extended emission and a bright emission knot in the north-eastern part of the supernova shell.
Also, four point X-ray sources have been detected, including three objects identified in 4XMM-DR10
and Chandra point source catalogs, and one newly discovered X-ray emitter.

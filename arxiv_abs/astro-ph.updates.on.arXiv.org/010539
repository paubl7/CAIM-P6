We present a brief review of observational results contributing to modern ideas on the evolution
of stellar activity. Basic laws, derived for both rotation-age and activity-rotation relationships,
allow us to trace how the activity of low-mass stars changes with age during their stay on the main
sequence. We focus on the evaluation of the activity properties of stars that could be analogs of
the young Sun. Our study includes joint consideration of different tracers of activity, rotation
and magnetic fields of Sun-like stars of various ages. We identify rotation periods, when the saturated
regime of activity changes to the unsaturated mode, when the solar-type activity is formed: for
G- and K-type stars, they are 1.1 and 3.3 days, respectively. This corresponds to an age interval
of about 0.2-0.6 Gyr, when regular sunspot cycle began to be established on the early Sun. We discuss
properties of the coronal and chromospheric activity in young Suns. Our evaluation of the EUV-fluxes
in the spectral range of 1350-1750 A shows that the far-UV radiation of the early Sun was a factor of
7 times more intense than that of the present-day Sun, and twice higher when the regular sunspot cycle
was established. For the young Sun, we can estimate the possible mass loss rate associated with quasi-steady
outflow as $10^{-12} M_\odot$/yr. The results of observations of the largest flares on solar-type
stars are also discussed, leading to conclusion that the most powerful phenomena occur on the fast-rotating
stars in the saturated activity regime. Our estimate of the stellar magnetic fields makes it possible
to evaluate the maximal possible flare energy. This could help us better understand the origin of
extreme events on the Sun in the past.

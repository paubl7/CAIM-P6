In a Quantum Field Theory, the analytic structure of the 2-points correlation functions, ie the
propagators, encloses information about the properties of the corresponding quanta, particularly
if they are or not confined. However, in Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), we can only have an analytic
solution in a perturbative picture of the theory. For the non-perturbative propagators, one resorts
on numerical solutions of QCD that accesses specific regions of the Euclidean momentum space, as,
for example, those computed via Monte Carlo simulations on the lattice. In the present work, we rely
on Pad\'e Approximants (PA) to approximate the numerical data for the gluon and ghost propagators,
and investigate their analytic structures. In a first stage, the advantages of using PAs are explored
when reproducing the properties of a function, focusing on its analytic structure. The use of PA
sequences is tested for the perturbative solutions of the propagators, and a residue analysis is
performed to help in the identification of the analytic structure. A technique used to approximate
a PA to a discrete set of points is proposed and tested for some test data sets. Finally, the methodology
is applied to the Landau gauge gluon and ghost propagators, obtained via lattice simulations. The
results identify a conjugate pair of complex poles for the gluon propagator, that is associated
with the infrared structure of the theory. This is in line with the presence of singularities for
complex momenta in theories where confinement is observed. Regarding the ghost propagator, a pole
at $p^2=0$ is identified. For both propagators, a branch cut is found on the real negative $p^2$-axis,
which recovers the perturbative analysis at high momenta.

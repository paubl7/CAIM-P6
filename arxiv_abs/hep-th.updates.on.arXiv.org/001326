In this article, we study the quantum field theoretic generalization of the Caldeira-Leggett model
to describe the Brownian Motion in general curved space-time considering interactions between
two scalar fields in a classical gravitational background. The thermalization phenomena is then
studied from the obtained de Sitter solution using quantum quench from one scalar field model obtained
from path integrated effective action in Euclidean signature. We consider an instantaneous quench
in the time-dependent mass protocol of the field of our interest. We find that the dynamics of the
field post-quench can be described in terms of the state of the generalized Calabrese-Cardy (gCC)
form and computed the different types of two-point correlation functions in this context. We explicitly
found the conserved charges of $W_{\infty}$ algebra that represents the gCC state after a quench
in de Sitter space and found it to be significantly different from the flat space-time results. We
extend our study for the different two-point correlation functions not only considering the pre-quench
state as the ground state, but also a squeezed state. We found that irrespective of the pre-quench
state, the post quench state can be written in terms of the gCC state showing that the subsystem of
our interest thermalizes in de Sitter space. Furthermore, we provide a general expression for the
two-point correlators and explicitly show the thermalization process by considering a thermal
Generalized Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Finally, from the equal time momentum dependent counterpart
of the obtained results for the two-point correlators, we have studied the hidden features of the
power spectra and studied its consequences for different choices of the quantum initial conditions.

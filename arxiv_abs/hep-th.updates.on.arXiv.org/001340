We explicitly construct a class of holographic quantum error correction codes with non-trivial
centers in the code subalgebra. Specifically, we use the Bacon-Shor codes and perfect tensors to
construct a gauge code (or a stabilizer code with gauge-fixing), which we call the holographic hybrid
code. This code admits a local log-depth encoding/decoding circuit, and can be represented as a
holographic tensor network which satisfies an analog of the Ryu-Takayanagi formula and reproduces
features of the sub-region duality. We then construct approximate versions of the holographic
hybrid codes by "skewing" the code subspace, where the size of skewing is analogous to the size of
the gravitational constant in holography. These approximate hybrid codes are not necessarily
stabilizer codes, but they can be expressed as the superposition of holographic tensor networks
that are stabilizer codes. For such constructions, different logical states, representing different
bulk matter content, can "back-react" on the emergent geometry, resembling a key feature of gravity.
The locality of the bulk degrees of freedom becomes subspace-dependent and approximate. Such subspace-dependence
is manifest from the point of view of the "entanglement wedge" and bulk operator reconstruction
from the boundary. Exact complementary error correction breaks down for certain bipartition of
the boundary degrees of freedom; however, a limited, state-dependent form is preserved for particular
subspaces. We also construct an example where the connected two-point correlation functions can
have a power-law decay. Coupled with known constraints from holography, a weakly back-reacting
bulk also forces these skewed tensor network models to the "large $N$ limit" where they are built
by concatenating a large $N$ number of copies.

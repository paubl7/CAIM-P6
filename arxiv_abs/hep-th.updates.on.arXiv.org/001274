In this work we shall study the implications of a subclass of $E$-models cosmological attractors,
namely of $a$-attractors, on hydrodynamically stable slowly rotating neutron stars. Specifically,
we shall present the Jordan frame theory of the $a$-attractors, and by using a conformal transformation
we shall derive the Einstein frame theory. We discuss the inflationary context of $a$-attractors
in order to specify the allowed range of values for the free parameters of the model based on the latest
cosmic-microwave-background-based Planck 2018 data. Accordingly, using the notation and physical
units frequently used in theoretical astrophysics contexts, we shall derive the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff
equations in the Einstein frame. Assuming a piecewise polytropic equation of state, the lowest
density part of which shall be chosen to be the WFF1, or APR or the SLy EoS, we numerically solve the
Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations using a double shooting python-based "LSODA" numerical
code. The resulting picture depends on the value of the parameter $a$ characterizing the $a$-attractors.
As we show, for large values of $a$, which do not produce a viable inflationary era, the $M-R$ graphs
are nearly identical to the general relativistic result, and these two are discriminated at large
central densities values. Also, for large $a$-values, the WFF1 equation of state is excluded, due
to the GW170817 constraints. In addition, the small $a$ cases produce larger masses and radii compared
to the general relativistic case and are compatible with the GW170817 constraints on the radii of
neutron stars. Our results indicate deep and not yet completely understood connections between
non-minimal inflationary attractors and neutron stars phenomenology in scalar-tensor theory.

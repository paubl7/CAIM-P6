We propose a family of Abelian quantum Hall states termed the non-diagonal states, which arise at
filling factors $\nu=p/2q$ for bosonic systems and $\nu=p/(p+2q)$ for fermionic systems, with
$p$ and $q$ being two coprime integers. Non-diagonal quantum Hall states are constructed in a coupled
wire model, which shows an intimate relation to the non-diagonal conformal field theory and has
a constrained pattern of motion for bulk quasiparticles, featuring a non-trivial interplay between
charge symmetry and translation symmetry. The non-diagonal state is established as a distinctive
symmetry-enriched topological order. Aside from the usual $U(1)$ charge sector, there is an additional
symmetry-enriched neutral sector described by the quantum double model $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$,
which relies on the presence of both the $U(1)$ charge symmetry and the $\mathbb{Z}$ translation
symmetry of the wire model. Translation symmetry distinguishes non-diagonal states from Laughlin
states, in a way similar to how it distinguishes weak topological insulators from trivial band insulators.
Moreover, the translation symmetry in non-diagonal states can be associated to the $\mathbf{e}\leftrightarrow\mathbf{m}$
anyonic symmetry in $\mathcal{D}(\mathbb{Z}_p)$, implying the role of dislocations as two-fold
twist-defects. The boundary theory of non-diagonal states is derived microscopically. For the
edge perpendicular to the direction of wires, the effective Hamiltonian has two components: a chiral
Luttinger liquid and a generalized $p$-state clock model. Importantly, translation symmetry
in the bulk is realized as self-duality on the edge. The symmetric edge is thus either gapless or gapped
with spontaneously broken symmetry. For $p=2,3$, the respective electron tunneling exponents
are predicted for experimental probes.

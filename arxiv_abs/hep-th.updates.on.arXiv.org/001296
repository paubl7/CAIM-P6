Performing a leading-order renormalization group analysis, here we compute the effects of generic
local or short-range electronic interactions in monolayer and Bernal bilayer graphene. Respectively
in these two systems chiral quasiparticles display linear and biquadratic band touching, leading
to linearly vanishing and constant DOS. Consequently, the former system remains stable for weak
enough local interactions, and supports a variety of ordered phases only beyond a critical strength
of interactions. By contrast, ordered phases can nucleate for sufficiently weak interactions
in bilayer graphene. By tuning the strength of all symmetry allowed local interactions, we construct
various cuts of the phase diagram at zero and finite temperature and chemical doping. Typically,
at zero doping insulating phases (such as charge-density-wave, antiferromagnet, quantum anomalous
and spin Hall insulators) prevail at the lowest temperature, while gapless nematic or smectic liquids
stabilize at higher temperatures. On the other hand, at finite doping the lowest temperature ordered
phase is occupied by a superconductor. Besides anchoring such an organizing principle among the
candidate ordered phases, we also establish a selection rule between them and the interaction channel
responsible for the breakdown of linear or biquadrtic chiral nodal Fermi liquid. In addition, we
also demonstrate the role of the normal state band structure in selecting the pattern of symmetry
breaking from a soup of preselected incipient competing orders. As a direct consequence of the selection
rule, while an antiferromagnetic phase develops in undoped monolayer and bilayer graphene, the
linear (biquadratic) band dispersion favors condensation of a spin-singlet nematic (translational
symmetry breaking Kekul\'e) superconductor in doped monolayer (bilayer) graphene, when the on
site Hubbard repulsion dominates in these systems.

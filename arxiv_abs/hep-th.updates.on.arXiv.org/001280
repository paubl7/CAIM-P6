It is well known that the inflationary scenario often displays different sets of degeneracies in
its predictions for CMB observables. These degeneracies usually arise either because multiple
inflationary models predict similar values for the scalar spectral index $n_{_S}$ and the tensor-to-scalar
ratio $r$, or because within the same model, the values of $\lbrace n_{_S}, r \rbrace$ are insensitive
to some of the model parameters, making it difficult for CMB observations alone to constitute a unique
probe of inflationary cosmology. We demonstrate that by taking into account constraints on the
post-inflationary reheating parameters such as the duration of reheating $N_{_{\rm re}}$, its
temperature $T_{_{\rm re}}$ and especially its equation of state (EOS), $w_{_{\rm re}}$, it is
possible to break this degeneracy in certain classes of inflationary models where identical values
of $\lbrace n_{_S}, r \rbrace$ can correspond to different reheating $w_{_{\rm re}}$. In particular,
we show how reheating constraints can break inflationary degeneracies in the T-model and the E-model
$\alpha$-attractors. Non-canonical inflation is also studied. The relic gravitational wave
(GW) spectrum provides us with another tool to break inflationary degeneracies. This is because
the GW spectrum is sensitive to the post-inflationary EOS of the universe. Indeed a stiff EOS during
reheating $(w_{_{\rm re}} > 1/3)$ gives rise to a small scale blue tilt in the spectral index $n_{_{\rm
GW}} = \frac{d\log{\Omega_{_{\rm GW}}}}{d\log{k}} > 0$, while a soft EOS $(w_{_{\rm re}} < 1/3)$
results in a red tilt. Relic GWs therefore provide us with valuable information about the post-inflationary
epoch, and their spectrum can be used to cure inflationary degeneracies in $\lbrace n_{_S}, r\rbrace$.

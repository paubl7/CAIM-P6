The genus zero contribution to the four-point correlator $\langle {\cal O}_{p_1}{\cal O}_{p_2}{\cal
O}_{p_3}{\cal O}_{p_4}\rangle$ of half-BPS single-particle operators ${\cal O}_p$ in $\mathcal{N}=4$
super Yang-Mills at strong coupling computes the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude of closed superstrings
on $AdS_5\times S^5$. Combining Mellin space techniques, the large $p$ limit, and data about the
spectrum of two-particle operators at tree level in supergravity, we design a bootstrap algorithm
which heavily constrains its $\alpha'$ expansion. We use crossing symmetry, polynomiality in
the Mellin variables and the large $p$ limit to stratify the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude away from
the ten-dimensional flat space limit. Then we analyse the spectrum of exchanged two-particle operators
at fixed order in the $\alpha'$ expansion. We impose that the ten-dimensional spin of the spectrum
visible at that order is bounded above in the same way as in the flat space amplitude. This constraint
determines the Virasoro-Shapiro amplitude in $AdS_5\times S^5$ up to a small number of ambiguities
at each order and we compute it explicitly for $(\alpha')^{5,6,7,8,9}$. As the order of $\alpha'$
grows, the ten dimensional spin grows, and the set of visible two-particle operators opens up. Operators
illuminated for the first time receive a string correction to their anomalous dimensions. This
correction is uniquely determined and lifts the residual degeneracy of tree level supergravity
due to ten-dimensional conformal symmetry. We encode the lifting of the residual degeneracy in
a characteristic polynomial. This object carries information about all orders in $\alpha'$.It
is analytic in the quantum numbers, symmetric under an $AdS_5 \leftrightarrow S^5$ exchange, and
it enjoys intriguing properties, which we explain and detail in various cases.

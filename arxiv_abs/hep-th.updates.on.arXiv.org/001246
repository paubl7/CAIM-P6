We investigate the effects of non-Hermiticity on interacting fermionic systems. We do this by including
non-Hermitian bilinear terms into the 3+1 dimensional Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. Two possible
bilinear modifications give rise to $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetric theories; this happens when the
standard NJL model is extended either by a pseudovector background field $ig \bar\psi\gamma_5
B_\mu \gamma^\mu \psi$ or by an antisymmetric-tensor background field $g \bar\psi F_{\mu\nu}\gamma^\mu
\gamma^\nu \psi$. The three remaining bilinears are {\it anti}-$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric in
nature, $ig \bar\psi B_\mu \gamma^\mu \psi, ig\bar\psi \gamma_5 \psi$ and $ig\bar\psi {1}\psi$,
so that the Hamiltonian then has no overall symmetry. The pseudovector $ig \bar\psi\gamma_5 B_\mu
\gamma^\mu \psi$ and the vector $ig \bar\psi B_\mu \gamma^\mu \psi$ combinations, are, in addition,
chirally symmetric. Thus, within this framework we are able to examine the effects that the various
combinations of non-Hermiticity, $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry, chiral symmetry and the two-body
interactions of the NJL model have on the existence and dynamical generation of a real effective
fermion mass (a feature which is absent in the corresponding modified massless free Dirac models)
as well as on the masses of the composite particles, the pseudoscalar and scalar mesonic modes ($\pi$
and $\sigma$ mesons). Our findings demonstrate that $\mathcal{PT}$ symmetry is not necessary
for real fermion mass solutions to exist, rather the two-body interactions of the NJL model supersede
the non-Hermitian bilinear effects. The effects of chiral symmetry are evident most clearly in
the meson modes, the pseudoscalar of which will always be Goldstone in nature if the system is chirally
symmetric. Second solutions of the mesonic equations are also discussed.

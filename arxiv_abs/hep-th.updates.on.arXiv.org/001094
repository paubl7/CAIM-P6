I develop an Effective Field Theory (EFT) framework to compute jet substructure observables for
heavy ion collision experiments. I consider dijet events that accompany the formation of a weakly
coupled Quark Gluon Plasma(QGP) medium in a heavy ion collision and look at the simultaneous measurement
of jet mass along with the transverse momentum imbalance between the jets accounting for both vacuum
and medium evolution. The jets are groomed using a suitable grooming algorithm in order to mitigate
effects of soft contamination from Multi-parton interactions as well as the QGP medium. This has
the great advantage that we do not have to keep track of the evolution of the QGP medium into subsequent
soft hadrons since these are groomed away from the final jet. Treating the energetic jet as an open
quantum system interacting with a QGP bath, I write down a factorization formula within the SCET(Soft
Collinear Effective Theory) framework, in which the forward scattering regime accounts for the
interaction of the medium with the jet. This leads me to a Lindblad type master equation for the evolution
of the reduced density matrix of the jet in the Markovian approximation. The resulting solution
allows a resummation of large logarithms that arise due to the final state measurements imposed
while simultaneously summing over multiple interactions of the jet with the medium. I find that
the the decoherence between the hard interaction that creates the jet and the subsequent medium
interactions leads to $\ physical$ Infra-Red(IR) collinear divergences that are otherwise absent
in pure vacuum evolution. I show that these IR divergences are completely regulated by the medium
induced gluon mass and highlight the need to develop a multi-scale EFT approach in the future to resum
the new logarithms that arise from these divergences.

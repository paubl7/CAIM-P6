Poincar\'e invariance is a well-tested symmetry of nature and sits at the core of our description
of relativistic particles and gravity. At the same time, in most systems Poincar\'e invariance
is not a symmetry of the ground state and is hence broken spontaneously. This phenomenon is ubiquitous
in cosmology where Lorentz boosts are spontaneously broken by the existence of a preferred reference
frame in which the universe is homogeneous and isotropic. This motivates us to study scattering
amplitudes without requiring invariance of the interactions under Lorentz boosts. In particular,
using on-shell methods and assuming massless, relativistic and luminal particles of any spin,
we show that the allowed interactions around Minkowski spacetime are severely constrained by unitarity
and locality in the form of consistent factorization. The existence of an interacting massless
spin-2 particle enforces (analytically continued) three-particle amplitudes to be Lorentz invariant,
even those that do not involve a graviton, such as cubic scalar couplings. We conjecture this to be
true for all n-particle amplitudes. Also, particles of spin S > 2 cannot self-interact nor can be
minimally coupled to gravity, while particles of spin S > 1 cannot have electric charge. Given the
growing evidence that free gravitons are well described by massless, luminal relativistic particles,
our results imply that cubic graviton interactions in Minkowski must be those of general relativity
up to a unique Lorentz-invariant higher-derivative correction of mass dimension 9. Finally, we
point out that consistent factorization for massless particles is highly IR sensitive and therefore
our powerful at-space results do not straightforwardly apply to curved spacetime.

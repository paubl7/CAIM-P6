We study the impact of the viscous effects of the primordial plasma on the evolution of the primordial
gravitational waves (pGW) spectrum from Inflation until today, considering a self-consistent
interaction that incorporates the back-reaction of the GW into the plasma. We use a relativistic
causal hydrodynamic framework with a positive entropy production based on a Second-Order Theory
(SOT) in which the viscous properties of the fluid are effectively described by a new set of independent
variables. We study how the spin-2 modes typical of SOTs capture the simplest GW-fluid viscous interaction
to first order. We consider that all non-ideal properties of the primordial plasma are due to an extra
effectively massless self-interacting scalar field whose state becomes a many-particles one
after Reheating and for which an effective fluid description is suitable. We numerically solve
the evolution equations and explicitly compute the current GW spectrum obtaining two contributions.
On the one hand we have the viscous evolution of the pGW: For the collision-dominated regime the GW
source becomes negligible while in the collisionless limit there exists an absorption of the pGW
energy due to the damping effect produced by the free-streaming spin-2 modes of the fluid and driven
by the expansion of the Universe. The latter effect is characterized by a relative amplitude decrease
of about 1 to 10 \% with respect to the GW free evolution spectrum. On the other hand we get the GW production
due to the decay of the initial spin-2 fluctuations of the fluid that is negligible compared with
the above-mentioned contribution. This SOT framework captures the same qualitative effects on
the evolution of GW coupled to matter reported in previous works in which a kinetic theory approach
has been used.

We study partially massless gravity theory(PM gravity theory) and suggest an alternative way to
add higher order interaction vertices to the theory. Rather than introducing self interaction
vertices of the gravitational fields to the partially massless gravity action, we consider interactions
with matter fields, since it is well known that addition of the self interaction terms necessarily
breaks the $U(1)$ gauge symmetry that PM gravity theory enjoys. For the coupling with matter fields,
we consider two different types of interaction vertices. The first one is given by an interaction
Lagrangian density, $\mathcal L_{int}\sim h_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu}$, where $h_{\mu\nu}$ is the
PM gravity field and $T^{\mu\nu}$ is the stress-energy tensor of the matter fields. To retain the
$U(1)$ gauge symmetry, the matter fields also transform accordingly and it turns out that the transform
must be non-local in this case. The second type interaction is obtained by employing a gauge covariant
derivative with the PM gravity field, where the PM gravity fields play a role of a gauge connection
canceling the phase shift of the matter fields. We also study the actions and the equations of motion
of the partially massless gravity fields. As expected, it shows 4 unitary degrees of freedom. 2 of
them are traceless tensor modes and they are light like fields. The other 2 are transverse vector
modes and their dispersion relation changes as background space time (de Sitter) evolutes. In the
very early time, they are light like but in the very late time, their velocity become a half of speed
of light. The vector mode dispersion relation shows momentum dependent behavior. In fact, the higher(lower)
frequency modes show the faster(slower) velocity. We suggest their quantization, compute Hamiltonians
to present their exited quanta and construct their free propagators.

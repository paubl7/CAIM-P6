We provide further evidence to support the fact that a four-dimensional effective field theory
description with de Sitter isometries in IIB string theory, overcoming the no-go and the swampland
criteria, can only exist if de Sitter space is realized as a Glauber-Sudarshan state. We show here
that this result is independent of the choice of de Sitter slicings. The Glauber-Sudarshan state,
constructed by shifting the interacting vacuum in the M-theory uplift of the scenario, differs
from a standard coherent state in QFT in the sense that the shape and size of the state changes with
respect to time, implying changes in the graviton and the flux quanta. Despite this, the expectation
values of the graviton and flux operators in such a state reproduce the exact de Sitter background,
as long as we are within the temporal bound set by the onset of the strong coupling in the dual type IIA
side, and satisfy the corresponding Schwinger-Dyson's equations in the presence of hierarchically
controlled perturbative and non-perturbative quantum corrections. Additionally, we provide
a detailed study of the fluxes supporting the Glauber-Sudarshan state in the M-theory uplift of
the IIB scenario. We show explicitly how the Bianchi identities, anomaly cancellation and flux
quantization conditions, along-with the constraints from the Schwinger-Dyson's equations,
conspire together to provide the necessary temporal dependences to support such a state in full
M-theory. We also discuss how our analysis points towards a surprising connection to the four-dimensional
null energy condition, for a Friedman-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker state in the IIB side, as a consistency
condition for the existence of an effective field theory description in M-theory.

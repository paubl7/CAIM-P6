In a situation like eternal inflation, where our data is replicated at infinitely-many other space-time
events, it is necessary to make a prior assumption about our location to extract predictions. The
principle of mediocrity entails that we live at asymptotic late times, when the occupational probabilities
of vacua has settled to a near-equilibrium distribution. In this paper we further develop the idea
that we instead exist during the approach to equilibrium, much earlier than the exponentially-long
mixing time. In this case we are most likely to reside in vacua that are easily accessed dynamically.
Using first-passage statistics, we prove that vacua that maximize their space-time volume at early
times have: 1. maximal ever-hitting probability; 2. minimal mean first-passage time; and 3. minimal
decay rate. These requirements are succinctly captured by an early-time measure. The idea that
we live at early times is a predictive guiding principle, with many phenomenological implications.
First, our vacuum should lie deep in a funneled region, akin to folding energy landscapes of proteins.
Second, optimal landscape regions are characterized by relatively short-lived vacua, with lifetime
of order the de Sitter Page time. For our vacuum, this lifetime is $\sim 10^{130}$~years, which is
consistent with the Standard Model estimate due to Higgs metastability. Third, the measure favors
vacua with small, positive vacuum energy. This can address the cosmological constant problem,
provided there are sufficiently many vacua in the entire ensemble of funnels. As a concrete example,
we study the Bousso-Polchinski lattice of flux vacua, and find that the early-time measure favors
lattices with the fewest number of flux dimensions. This favors compactifications with a large
hierarchy between the lightest modulus and all other K\"ahler and complex structure moduli.

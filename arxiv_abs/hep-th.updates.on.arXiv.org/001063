It often is assumed that a test for spatial orientability requires a journey across the whole 3-space
to check for orientation-reversing paths. Since such a global expedition is not feasible, theoretical
arguments that combine universality of physical experiments with local arrow of time, CP violation
and CPT invariance are offered to support the choosing of time- and space-orientable spacetime
manifolds. We show that it is possible to access spatial orientability of Minkowski spacetime through
local physical effects involving quantum electromagnetic fluctuations. To this end, we study
the motions of a charged particle and an electric dipole under these fluctuations in Minkowski spacetime
with orientable and non-orientable spatial topologies. We derive expressions for the velocity
dispersion for both point-like particles in two spatially flat topologies. For the particle, we
show that it is possible to distinguish the orientable from the non-orientable topology by contrasting
the evolution of the dispersions. This result makes apparent that it is possible to access orientability
through electromagnetic quantum fluctuations. The answer to the question: how to locally probe
the orientability of Minkowski 3-space intrinsically comes about in the study of the motion of the
dipole. We find that a characteristic inversion pattern exhibited by the dipole velocity dispersion
curves is a signature of non-orientability. This important result makes it clear that it is possible
to locally unveil spatial non-orientability through the inversion pattern of velocity dispersion
curves of an electric dipole under quantum electromagnetic fluctuations. Our findings open the
way to a conceivable experiment involving quantum electromagnetic fluctuations to locally probe
the spatial orientability on the microscopic scale of Minkowski empty spacetime.

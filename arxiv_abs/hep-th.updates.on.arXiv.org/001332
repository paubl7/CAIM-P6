In five dimensions we consider a general shift symmetric and parity preserving scalar tensor action
that contains up to second order covariant derivatives of the scalar field. A rotating stealth black
hole solution is constructed where the metric is given by the Myers-Perry spacetime with equal momenta
and the scalar field is identified with the Hamilton-Jacobi potential. This nontrivial scalar
field has an extra hair associated with the rest mass of the test particle, and the solution does not
require any fine tuning of the coupling functions of the theory. Interestingly enough, we show that
the disformal transformation, generated by this scalar field, and with a constant degree of disformality,
leaves invariant (up to diffeomorphisms) the Myers-Perry metric with equal momenta. This means
that the hair of the scalar field, along with the constant disformality parameter, can be consistently
absorbed into further redefinitions of the mass and of the single angular parameter of the disformed
metric. These results are extended in higher odd dimensions with a Myers-Perry metric for which
all the momenta are equal. The key of the invariance under disformal transformation of the metric
is mainly the cohomogeneity-1 character of the Myers-Perry metric with equal momenta. Starting
from this observation, we consider a general class of cohomogeneity-1 metrics in arbitrary dimension,
and we list the conditions ensuring that this class of metrics remain invariant (up to diffeomorphisms)
under a disformal transformation with a constant degree of disformality and with a scalar field
with constant kinetic term. The extension to the Kerr-(A)dS case is also considered where it is shown
that rotating stealth solutions may exist provided some fine tuning of the coupling functions of
the scalar tensor theory.

We study eight different gamma-ray burst (GRB) data sets to examine whether current GRB measurements
-- that probe a largely unexplored part of cosmological redshift ($z$) space -- can be used to reliably
constrain cosmological model parameters. We use three Amati-correlation samples and five Combo-correlation
samples to simultaneously derive correlation and cosmological model parameter constraints.
The intrinsic dispersion of each GRB data set is taken as a goodness measurement. We examine the consistency
between the cosmological bounds from GRBs with those determined from better-established cosmological
probes, such as baryonic acoustic oscillation (BAO) and Hubble parameter $H(z)$ measurements.
We use the Markov chain Monte Carlo method implemented in \textsc{MontePython} to find best-fit
correlation and cosmological parameters, in six different cosmological models, for the eight
GRB samples, alone or in conjunction with BAO and $H(z)$ data. For the Amati correlation case, we
compile a data set of 118 bursts, the A118 sample, which is the largest -- about half of the total Amati-correlation
GRBs -- current collection of GRBs suitable for constraining cosmological parameters. This updated
GRB compilation has the smallest intrinsic dispersion of the three Amati-correlation GRB data
sets we examined. We are unable to define a collection of reliable bursts for current Combo-correlation
GRB data. Cosmological constraints determined from the A118 sample are consistent with -- but significantly
weaker than -- those from BAO and $H(z)$ data. They also are consistent with the spatially-flat $\Lambda$CDM
model as well as with dynamical dark energy models and non-spatially-flat models. Since GRBs probe
a largely unexplored region of $z$, it is well worth acquiring more and better-quality burst data
which will give a more definitive answer to the question of the title.

Pattern recognition algorithms are commonly employed to simplify the challenging and necessary
step of track reconstruction in sub-atomic physics experiments. Aiding in the discrimination
of relevant interactions, pattern recognition seeks to accelerate track reconstruction by isolating
signals of interest. In high collision rate experiments, such algorithms can be particularly crucial
for determining whether to retain or discard information from a given interaction even before the
data is transferred to tape. As data rates, detector resolution, noise, and inefficiencies increase,
pattern recognition becomes more computationally challenging, motivating the development of
higher efficiency algorithms and techniques. Quantum associative memory is an approach that seeks
to exploits quantum mechanical phenomena to gain advantage in learning capacity, or the number
of patterns that can be stored and accurately recalled. Here, we study quantum associative memory
based on quantum annealing and apply it to the particle track classification. We focus on discrimination
models based on Ising formulations of quantum associative memory model (QAMM) recall and quantum
content-addressable memory (QCAM) recall. We characterize classification performance of these
approaches as a function detector resolution, pattern library size, and detector inefficiencies,
using the D-Wave 2000Q processor as a testbed. Discrimination criteria is set using both solution-state
energy and classification labels embedded in solution states. We find that energy-based QAMM classification
performs well in regimes of small pattern density and low detector inefficiency. In contrast, state-based
QCAM achieves reasonably high accuracy recall for large pattern density and the greatest recall
accuracy robustness to a variety of detector noise sources.

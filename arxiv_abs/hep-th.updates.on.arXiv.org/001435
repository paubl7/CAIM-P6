We consider a Hayden \& Preskill like setup for both maximally chaotic and sub-maximally chaotic
quantum field theories. We act on the vacuum with an operator in a Rindler like wedge $R$ and transfer
a small subregion $I$ of $R$ to the other wedge. The chaotic scrambling dynamics of the QFT Rindler
time evolution reveals the information in the other wedge. The holographic dual of this process
involves a particle excitation falling into the bulk and crossing into the entanglement wedge of
the complement to $r=R \backslash I$. With the goal of studying the locality of the emergent holographic
theory we compute various quantum information measures on the boundary that tell us when the particle
has entered this entanglement wedge. In a maximally chaotic theory, these measures indicate a sharp
transition where the particle enters the wedge exactly when the insertion is null separated from
the quantum extremal surface for $r$. For sub-maximally chaotic theories, we find a smoothed crossover
at a delayed time given in terms of the smaller Lyapunov exponent and dependent on the time-smearing
scale of the probe excitation. The information quantities that we consider include the full vacuum
modular energy $R \backslash I$ as well as the fidelity between the state with the particle and the
state without. Along the way, we find a new explicit formula for the modular Hamiltonian of two intervals
in an arbitrary 1+1 dimensional CFT to leading order in the small cross ratio limit. We also give an
explicit calculation of the Regge limit of the modular flowed chaos correlator and find examples
which do not saturate the modular chaos bound. Finally, we discuss the extent to which our results
reveal properties of the target of the probe excitation as a ``stringy quantum extremal surface''
or simply quantify the probe itself thus giving a new approach to studying the notion of longitudinal
string spreading.

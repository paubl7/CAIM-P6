Equilibrium quantum many-body systems in the vicinity of phase transitions generically manifest
universality. In contrast, limited knowledge has been gained on possible universal characteristics
in the non-equilibrium evolution of systems in quantum critical phases. Here, we present such a
universal feature in the equilibration dynamics of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) Hamiltonian --
a paradigmatic system of disordered, all-to-all interacting fermions that has been designed as
a phenomenological description of quantum critical regions. We drive the system far away from equilibrium
by performing a global quench, and track how its ensemble average relaxes to a steady state. Employing
state-of-the-art numerical simulations for the exact evolution, we reveal that the disorder-averaged
evolution of few-body observables, including the quantum Fisher information (QFI) and low-order
moments of local operators, exhibit within numerical resolution a universal equilibration process.
Under a straightforward rescaling, data that correspond to different initial states collapse
onto a universal curve, which can be well approximated by a Gaussian throughout large parts of the
evolution. To reveal the physics behind this process, we formulate a general theoretical framework
based on the Novikov--Furutsu theorem. This framework extracts the disorder-averaged dynamics
of a many-body system as an effective dissipative evolution, and can have applications beyond this
work. The exact non-Markovian evolution of the SYK ensemble is very well captured by Bourret--Markov
approximations, which contrary to common lore become justified thanks to the extreme chaoticity
of the system, and universality is revealed in a spectral analysis of the corresponding Liouvillian.

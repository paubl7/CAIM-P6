It has long been realized that the effect of the local acceleration is equivalent to a thermal temperature
bath termed as Unruh effect. The two accelerated observers can detect quantum correlations between
them through the vacuum field. A natural question arises: Can we quantify the quantum correlations
between the two accelerated detectors or equivalently between two locations in curved space time
and are these equilibrium (equal accelerations of the two detectors) quantum correlation equivalent
to the ones between the two stationary detectors under a thermal bath? A further question is what
if the two accelerations or the couplings between the detectors and the vacuum field are different
and how this nonequilibrium effect can influence the quantum correlations. In this study, we examine
the above scenarios. The temperature and acceleration characterizing the equivalently effective
local space-time curvature show qualitatively similar and quantitatively different impacts
on the quantum correlations in this equilibrium scenario. This shows the similarities and differences
between the two detectors under equal accelerations or equivalently local curvatures and the same
temperatures for the effects on the quantum correlations. As the acceleration (temperature) of
the detectors increases, the entanglement decreases to zero at some instant but the mutual information
(discord) is amplified. As the acceleration increases when the equal acceleration is in the opposite
direction, the quantum correlation decays. Importantly, we show that the larger quantum correlations
can appear due to the nonequilibriumness characterized by the degree of the detailed balance breaking
from enhanced difference in the couplings. We also uncovered that both the nonequilibriumness
and the distance between the detectors affect the quantum correlations between the detectors.

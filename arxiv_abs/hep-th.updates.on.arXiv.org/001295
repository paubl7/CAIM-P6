We present a doubly holographic prescription for computing entanglement entropy on a gravitating
brane. It involves a Ryu-Takayanagi surface with a Dirichlet anchoring condition. In braneworld
cosmology, a related approach was used previously in arXiv:2007.06551. There, the prescription
naturally computed a co-moving entanglement entropy, and was argued to resolve the information
paradox for a black hole living in the cosmology. In this paper, we show that the Dirichlet prescription
leads to reasonable results, when applied to a recently studied wedge holography set up with a gravitating
bath. The nature of the information paradox and its resolution in our Dirichlet problem have a natural
understanding in terms of the strength of gravity on the two branes and at the anchoring location.
By sliding the anchor to the defect, we demonstrate that the limit where gravity decouples from the
anchor is continuous -- in other words, as far as island physics is considered, weak gravity on the
anchor is identical to no gravity. The weak and (moderately) strong gravity regions on the brane
are separated by a "Dirichlet wall". We find an intricate interplay between various extremal surfaces,
with an island coming to the rescue whenever there is an information paradox. This is despite the
presence of massless gravitons in the spectrum. The overall physics is consistent with the slogan
that gravity becomes "more holographic", as it gets stronger. Our observations strengthen the
case that the conventional Page curve is indeed of significance, when discussing the information
paradox in flat space. We work in high enough dimensions so that the graviton is non-trivial, and
our results are in line with the previous discussions on gravitating baths in arXiv:2005.02993
and arXiv:2007.06551.

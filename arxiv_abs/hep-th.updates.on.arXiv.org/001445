We provide a comprehensive summary of concepts from Calabi-Yau motives relevant to the computation
of multi-loop Feynman integrals. From this we derive several consequences for multi-loop integrals
in general, and we illustrate them on the example of multi-loop banana integrals. For example, we
show how Griffiths transversality, known from the theory of variation of mixed Hodge structures,
leads quite generically to a set of quadratic relations among maximal cut integrals associated
to Calabi-Yau motives. These quadratic relations then naturally lead to a compact expression for
$l$-loop banana integrals in $D=2$ dimensions in terms of an integral over a period of a Calabi-Yau
$(l-1)$-fold. This new integral representation generalizes in a natural way the known representations
for $l\le 3$ involving logarithms with square root arguments and iterated integrals of Eisenstein
series. In a second part, we show how the results obtained by some of the authors in earlier work can
be extended to dimensional regularization. We present a method to obtain the differential equations
for banana integrals with an arbitrary number of loops in dimensional regularization without the
need to solve integration-by-parts relations. We also present a compact formula for the leading
asymptotics of banana integrals with an arbitrary number of loops in the large momentum limit. This
generalizes the novel $\widehat{\Gamma}$-class introduced by some of the authors to dimensional
regularization and provides a convenient boundary condition to solve the differential equations
for the banana integrals. As an application, we present for the first time numerical results for
equal-mass banana integrals with up to four loops and up to second order in the dimensional regulator.

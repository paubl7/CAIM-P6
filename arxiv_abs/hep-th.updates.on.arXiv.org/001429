In AdS/CFT partition functions of decoupled copies of the CFT factorize. In bulk computations of
such quantities contributions from spacetime wormholes which link separate asymptotic boundaries
threaten to spoil this property, leading to a "factorization puzzle." Certain simple models like
JT gravity have wormholes, but bulk computations in them correspond to averages over an ensemble
of boundary systems. These averages need not factorize. We can formulate a toy version of the factorization
puzzle in such models by focusing on a specific member of the ensemble where partition functions
will again factorize. As Coleman and Giddings-Strominger pointed out in the 1980s, fixed members
of ensembles are described in the bulk by "$\alpha$-states" in a many-universe Hilbert space. In
this paper we analyze in detail the bulk mechanism for factorization in such $\alpha$-states in
the topological model introduced by Marolf and Maxfield (the "MM model") and in JT gravity. In these
models geometric calculations in $\alpha$ states are poorly controlled. We circumvent this complication
by working in $\textit{approximate}$ $\alpha$ states where bulk calculations just involve the
simplest topologies: disks and cylinders. One of our main results is an effective description of
the factorization mechanism. In this effective description the many-universe contributions
from the full $\alpha$ state are replaced by a small number of effective boundaries. Our motivation
in constructing this effective description, and more generally in studying these simple ensemble
models, is that the lessons learned might have wider applicability. In fact the effective description
lines up with a recent discussion of the SYK model with fixed couplings arXiv:2103.16754. We conclude
with some discussion about the possible applicability of this effective model in more general contexts.

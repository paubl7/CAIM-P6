Can a dynamically robust bosonic star (BS) produce an (effective) shadow that mimics that of a black
hole (BH)? The BH shadow is linked to the existence of light rings (LRs). For free bosonic fields,
yielding mini-BSs, it is known that these stars can become ultra-compact - i.e., possess LRs - but
only for perturbatively unstable solutions. We show this remains the case even when different self-interactions
are considered. However, an effective shadow can arise in a different way: if BSs reproduce the existence
of an innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) for timelike geodesics (located at $r_{\rm ISCO}=6M$
for a Schwarzschild BH of mass M), the accretion flow morphology around BHs is mimicked and an effective
shadow arises in an astrophysical environment. Even though spherical BSs may accommodate stable
timelike circular orbits all the way down to their centre, we show the angular velocity along such
orbits may have a maximum away from the origin, at $R_{\Omega}$; this scale was recently observed
to mimic the BH's ISCO in some scenarios of accretion flow. Then: (i) for free scalar fields or with
quartic self-interactions, $R_{\Omega}\neq 0$ only for perturbatively unstable BSs; (ii) for
higher scalar self-interactions, e.g. axionic, $R_{\Omega}\neq 0$ is possible for perturbatively
stable BSs, but no solution with $R_{\Omega}=6M$ was found in the parameter space explored; (iii)
but for free vector fields, yielding Proca stars (PSs), perturbatively stable solutions with $R_{\Omega}\neq
0$ exist, and indeed $R_{\Omega}=6M$ for a particular solution. Thus, dynamically robust spherical
PSs can mimic the shadow of a (near-)equilibrium Schwarzschild BH with the same M, in an astrophysical
environment, despite the absence of a LR, at least under some observation conditions, as we confirm
by comparing the lensing of such PSs and Schwarzschild BHs.

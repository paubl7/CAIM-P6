The Bogoliubov transformation connecting the standard inertial frame mode functions to the standard
mode functions defined in the Rindler frame $R_0$, leads to the result that the inertial vacuum appears
as a thermal state with temperature $T_0=a_0/2\pi$ where $a_0$ is the acceleration parameter of
$R_0$. We construct an infinite family of nested Rindler-like coordinate systems $R_1, R_2, ...$
within the right Rindler wedge, with time coordinates $\tau_1, \tau_2, ...,$ and acceleration
parameters $a_1, a_2, ...$ by shifting the origin along the inertial $x$-axis by amounts $\ell_1,
\ell_2,\cdots$. We show that, apart from the inertial vacuum, the Rindler vacuum of the frame $R_n$
also appears to be a thermal state in the frame $R_{n+1}$ with the temperature $a_{n+1}/2\pi$. In
fact, the Rindler frame $R_{n+1}$ attributes to all the Rindler vacuum states of $R_1, R_2, ... R_n$,
as well as to the inertial vacuum state, the same temperature $a_{n+1}/2\pi$. The frame with the
shift $\ell$ and the corresponding acceleration parameter $a(\ell)$ can be thought of as a Rindler
frame which is instantaneously comoving with the Einstein's elevator moving with a variable acceleration.
Our result suggests that the quantum temperature associated with such an Einstein's elevator is
the same as that defined in the comoving Rindler frame. The shift parameters $\ell_j$ are crucial
for the inequivalent character of these vacua and encode the fact that Rindler vacua are not invariant
under spatial translation. We further show that our result is discontinuous in an essential way
in the coordinate shift parameters. Similar structures can be introduced in the right wedge of any
spacetime with bifurcate Killing horizon, like, for e.g., Schwarzschild spacetime. This has important
implications for quantum gravity when flat spacetime is treated as the ground state of quantum gravity.

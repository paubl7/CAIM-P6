In previous works we have embedded the Running Vacuum Model (RVM) of Cosmology in the framework of
string theory. Specifically, we considered a string-inspired Cosmology with primordial gravitational
waves (GW) and gravitational anomalies, which were argued to lead, via appropriate condensation
during the very-early-universe era, to dynamical inflation, of RVM type, without the need for extra
inflaton fields. A crucial role for the associated slow-roll nature of the inflationary era was
played by the fundamental axion field that exists in the gravitational multiplet of strings, viz.
the Kalb-Ramond (KR) axion. In this paper, we study further this model and demonstrate several novel
facts, completing our previous studies. We clarify the different roles played by the background
KR axions, which constitute a form of stiff matter that dominates a pre-RVM-inflationary epoch
of the Universe. We show that the KR axion when combined with the gravitational Chern-Simons contribution
obey together a peculiar equation of state $p=-\rho$, with negative energy density $\rho < 0$, which
we call `phantom vacuum'. Eventually, this state transmutes into the standard vacuum state thanks
to the contribution from the gravitational Chern-Simons condensate, which makes the total $\rho_{\rm
total} =-p_{\rm total} >0$. At this point the RVM vacuum picture emerges naturally, with an overall
equation of state of true vacuum type. We find that our scenario is consistent with the trans-Planckian
censorship hypothesis, given that the rate of change of the KR axion takes only sub-Planckian values.
We also discuss some explicit scenarios on the creation of GWs within the context of supergravity
models that could be embedded in our string theory framework. {Finally, we argue how the RVM in our
context can help to alleviate the current tensions of the $\Lambda$CDM.}

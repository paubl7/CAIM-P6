When a Poincar\'e-invariant system spontaneously breaks continuous internal symmetries, Goldstones's
theorem demands the existence of massless, spin-zero excitations in a one-to-one correspondence
with the broken symmetry generators. When a system spontaneously breaks Poincar\'e symmetry,
however, the kinds of excitations that satisfy Goldstone's theorem can be quite unusual. In particular,
they may have any spin and need not be particles or even quasiparticles. The standard coset construction
used to formulate effective actions of Goldstones, however, is rather restrictive and is incapable
of generating the full spectrum of possibilities allowed by Goldstone's theorem. We propose a (partial)
remedy to this problem by postulating a novel coset construction for systems that spontaneously
break Poincar\'e symmetry. This new construction is capable of generating effective actions with
a wide range of Goldstone excitations---including fermionic degrees of freedom---even when all
symmetries are bosonic. To demonstrate it's utility, we focus on constructing effective actions
for point particles of various spins. We recover the known result that a particle of spin $s$ requires
an $\mathcal N=2s$ supersymmetric worldline reparameterization gauge symmetry, which we implement
at the level of the coset construction. In the process, we discover that massless particles require
a novel kind of inverse Higgs constraint that bears some resemblance to the dynamical inverse Higgs
constraints that appear in certain fermi liquid effective field theories. We then consider particles
that, in addition to quantum spin, have finite spatial extent and are free to rotate. We derive a novel
action for such particles and find a `spin-orbital' coupling between the intrinsic quantum spin
and the physical-rotation degrees of freedom.

Clean isotropic quantum Hall fluids in the continuum possess a host of symmetry-protected quantized
invariants, such as the Hall conductivity, shift and Hall viscosity. Here we develop a theory of
symmetry-protected quantized invariants for topological phases defined on a lattice, where quantized
invariants with no continuum analog can arise. We develop topological field theories using discrete
crystalline gauge fields to fully characterize quantized invariants of (2+1)D Abelian topological
orders with symmetry group $G = U(1) \times G_{\text{space}}$, where $G_{\text{space}}$ consists
of orientation-preserving space group symmetries on the lattice. We show how discrete rotational
and translational symmetry fractionalization can be characterized by a discrete spin vector,
a discrete torsion vector which has no analog in the continuum or in the absence of lattice rotation
symmetry, and an area vector, which also has no analog in the continuum. The discrete torsion vector
implies a type of crystal momentum fractionalization that is only non-trivial for $2$, $3$, and
$4$-fold rotation symmetry. The quantized topological response theory includes a discrete version
of the shift, which binds fractional charge to disclinations and corners, a fractionally quantized
angular momentum of disclinations, rotationally symmetric fractional charge polarization and
its angular momentum counterpart, constraints on charge and angular momentum per unit cell, and
quantized momentum bound to dislocations and units of area. The fractionally quantized charge
polarization, which is non-trivial only on a lattice with $2$, $3$, and $4$-fold rotation symmetry,
implies a fractional charge bound to lattice dislocations and a fractional charge per unit length
along the boundary. An important role is played by a finite group grading on Burgers vectors, which
depends on the point group symmetry of the lattice.

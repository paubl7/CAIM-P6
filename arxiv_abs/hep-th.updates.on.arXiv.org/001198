We exploit the theoretical strength of the supervariable and Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST)
formalisms to derive the proper (i.e. off-shell nilpotent and absolutely anticommuting) (anti-)BRST
symmetry transformations for the reparameterization invariant model of a non-relativistic (NR)
free particle whose space $(x)$ and time $(t)$ variables are function of an evolution parameter
$(\tau)$. The infinitesimal reparameterization (i.e. 1D diffeomorphism) symmetry transformation
of our theory is defined w.r.t. this evolution parameter $(\tau)$. We apply the modified Bonora-Tonin
(BT) supervariable approach (MBTSA) as well as the (anti-)chiral supervariable approach (ACSA)
to BRST formalism to discuss various aspects of our present system. For this purpose, our 1D ordinary
theory (parameterized by $\tau$) is generalized onto a $(1, 2)$-dimensional supermanifold which
is characterized by the superspace coordinates $Z^M = (\tau, \theta, \bar\theta)$ where a pair
of Grassmannian variables satisfy the fermionic relationships: $\theta^2 = {\bar\theta}^2 =
0, \, \theta\,\bar\theta + \bar\theta\,\theta = 0$ and $\tau$ is the bosonic evolution parameter.
In the context of ACSA, we take into account only the (1, 1)-dimensional (anti-)chiral super sub-manifolds
of the general (1, 2)-dimensional supermanifold. The derivation of the universal Curci-Ferrari
(CF)-type restriction, from various underlying theoretical methods, is a novel observation in
our present endeavor. Furthermore, we note that the form of the gauge-fixing and Faddeev-Popov
ghost terms for our NR and non-SUSY system is exactly same as that of the reparameterization invariant
SUSY (i.e. spinning) and non-SUSY (i.e. scalar) relativistic particles. This is a novel observation,
too.

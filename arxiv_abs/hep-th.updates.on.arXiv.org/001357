We present a full symmetry classification of fermion matter in and out of thermal equilibrium. Our
approach starts from first principles, the ten different classes of linear and anti-linear state
transformations in fermionic Fock spaces, and symmetries defined via invariance properties of
the dynamical equation for the density matrix. The object of classification are then the generators
of reversible dynamics, dissipation and fluctuations featuring in the generally irreversible
and interacting dynamical equations. A sharp distinction between the symmetries of equilibrium
and out of equilibrium dynamics, respectively, arises from the different role played by `time'
in these two cases: In unitary quantum mechanics as well as in `micro-reversible' thermal equilibrium,
anti-linear transformations combined with an inversion of time define time reversal symmetry.
However, out of equilibrium an inversion of time becomes meaningless, while anti--linear transformations
in Fock space remain physically significant, and hence must be considered in autonomy. The practical
consequence of this dichotomy is a novel realization of antilinear symmetries (six out of the ten
fundamental classes) in non-equilibrium quantum dynamics that is fundamentally different from
the established rules of thermal equilibrium. At large times, the dynamical generators thus symmetry
classified determine the steady state non-equilibrium distributions for arbitrary interacting
systems. To illustrate this principle, we consider the fixation of a symmetry protected topological
phase in a system of interacting lattice fermions. More generally, we consider the practically
important class of mean field interacting systems, represented by Gaussian states. This class
is naturally described in the language of non-Hermitian matrices, which allows us to compare to
previous classification schemes in the literature.

We derive a new metric form of the complete family of black hole spacetimes (without a cosmological
constant) presented by Plebanski and Demianski in 1976. It further improves the convenient representation
of this large family of exact black holes found in 2005 by Griffiths and Podolsky. The main advantage
of the new metric is that the key functions are considerably simplified, fully explicit, and factorized.
All four horizons are thus clearly identified, and degenerate cases with extreme horizons can easily
be discussed. Moreover, the new metric depends only on six parameters with direct geometrical and
physical meaning, namely m, a, l, alpha, e, g which characterize mass, Kerr-like rotation, NUT parameter,
acceleration, electric and magnetic charges of the black hole, respectively. This general metric
reduces directly to the familiar forms of either (possibly accelerating) Kerr-Newman, charged
Taub-NUT solution, or (possibly rotating and charged) C-metric by simply setting the corresponding
parameters to zero, without the need of any further transformations. In addition, it shows that
the Plebanski-Demianski family does not involve accelerating black holes with just the NUT parameter,
which were discovered by Chng, Mann and Stelea in 2006. It also enables us to investigate various
physical properties, such as the character of singularities, horizons, ergoregions, global conformal
structure including the Penrose diagrams, cosmic strings causing the acceleration of the black
holes, their rotation, pathological regions with closed timelike curves, or explicit thermodynamic
properties. It thus seems that our new metric is a useful representation of this important family
of black hole spacetimes of algebraic type D in the asymptotically flat settings.

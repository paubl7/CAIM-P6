We investigate the relation between dilatation and conformal symmetries in the statistical mechanics
of flexible crystalline membranes. We analyze, in particular, a well-known model which describes
the fluctuations of a continuum elastic medium embedded in a higher-dimensional space. In this
theory, the renormalization group flow connects a non-interacting ultraviolet fixed point, where
the theory is controlled by linear elasticity, to an interacting infrared fixed point. By studying
the structure of correlation functions and of the energy-momentum tensor, we show that, in the infrared,
the theory is only scale-invariant: the dilatation symmetry is not enhanced to full conformal invariance.
The model is shown to present a non-vanishing virial current which, despite being non-conserved,
maintains a scaling dimension exactly equal to $D - 1$, even in presence of interactions. We attribute
the absence of anomalous dimensions to the symmetries of the model under translations and rotations
in the embedding space, which are realized as shifts of phonon fields, and which protect the renormalization
of several non-invariant operators. We also note that closure of a symmetry algebra with both shift
symmetries and conformal invariance would require, in the hypothesis that phonons transform as
primary fields, the presence of new shift symmetries which are not expected to hold on physical grounds.
We then consider an alternative model, involving only scalar fields, which describes effective
phonon-mediated interactions between local Gaussian curvatures. The model is described in the
ultraviolet by two copies of the biharmonic theory, which is conformal, but flows in the infrared
to a fixed point which we argue to be only dilatation-invariant.

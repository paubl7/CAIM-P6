Quantum homogeneous spaces are noncommutative spaces with quantum group covariance. Their semiclassical
counterparts are Poisson homogeneous spaces, which are quotient manifolds of Lie groups $M=G/H$
equipped with an additional Poisson structure $\pi$ which is compatible with a Poisson-Lie structure
$\Pi$ on $G$. Since the infinitesimal version of $\Pi$ defines a unique Lie bialgebra structure
$\delta$ on the Lie algebra $\frak g=\mbox{Lie}(G)$, we exploit the idea of Lie bialgebra duality
in order to study the notion of complementary dual homogeneous space $M^\perp=G^\ast/H^\perp$
of a given homogeneous space $M$ with respect to a coisotropic Lie bialgebra. Then, by considering
the natural notions of reductive and symmetric homogeneous spaces, we extend these concepts to
$M^\perp$ thus showing that an even richer duality framework between $M$ and $M^\perp$ arises from
them. In order to analyse physical implications of these notions, the case of $M$ being a Minkowski
or (Anti-) de Sitter Poisson homogeneous spacetime is fully studied, and the corresponding complementary
dual reductive and symmetric spaces $M^\perp$ are explicitly constructed in the case of the well-known
$\kappa$-deformation, where the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ is introduced as an explicit
parameter in order to describe all Lorentzian spaces simultaneously. In particular, the fact that
$M^\perp$ is a reductive space is shown to provide a natural condition for the representation theory
of the quantum analogue of $M$ that ensures the existence of physically meaningful uncertainty
relations between the noncommutative spacetime coordinates. Finally, despite these dual spaces
$M^\perp$ are not endowed in general with a $G^\ast$-invariant metric, we show that their geometry
can be described by making use of $K$-structures.

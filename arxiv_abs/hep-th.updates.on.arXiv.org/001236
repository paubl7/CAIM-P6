We analyze the general mathematical problem of global reconstruction of a function with least possible
errors, based on partial information such as n terms of a Taylor series at a point, possibly also with
coefficients of finite precision. We refer to this as the "inverse approximation theory problem,
because we seek to reconstruct a function from a given approximation, rather than constructing
an approximation for a given function. Within the class of functions analytic on a common Riemann
surface Omega, and a common Maclaurin series, we prove an optimality result on their reconstruction
at other points on Omega, and provide a method to attain it. The procedure uses the uniformization
theorem, and the optimal reconstruction errors depend only on the distance to the origin. We provide
explicit uniformization maps for some Riemann surfaces Omega of interest in applications. One
such map is the covering of the Borel plane of the tritronquee solutions to the Painleve equations
PI-PV. As an application we show that this uniformization map leads to dramatic improvement in the
extrapolation of the PI tritronquee solution throughout its domain of analyticity and also into
the pole sector. Given further information about the function, such as is available for the ubiquitous
class of resurgent functions, significantly better approximations are possible and we construct
them. In particular, any one of their singularities can be eliminated by specific linear operators,
and the local structure at the chosen singularity can be obtained in fine detail. More generally,
for functions of reasonable complexity, based on the nth order truncates alone we propose new efficient
tools which are convergent as n to infty, which provide near-optimal approximations of functions
globally, as well as in their most interesting regions, near singularities or natural boundaries.

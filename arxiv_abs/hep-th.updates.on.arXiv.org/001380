We study the structure of the scattering amplitudes of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons and the gravitational
KK Goldstone bosons with compactified fifth dimension. We analyze the geometric Higgs mechanism
for mass-generation of KK gravitons under compactification with a general $R_{\xi}$ gauge-fixing,
which is free from vDVZ discontinuity. With these, we formulate the Gravitational Equivalence
Theorem (GET) to connect the scattering amplitudes of longitudinally polarized KK gravitons (with
helicity-zero) to that of the corresponding gravitational KK Goldstone bosons, which is a manifestation
of the geometric Higgs mechanism at the $S$-matrix level. We present a direct computation of the
gravitational KK Goldstone boson scattering amplitudes at tree-level which equal the corresponding
longitudinal KK gravton amplitudes in the high energy limit. We further use the doubel-copy method
with color-kinematics duality to reconstruct, under the high energy expansion, the scattering
amplitudes of spin-2 KK gravitons and of their KK Goldstone bosons from the scattering amplitudes
of spin-1 KK gauge bosons and their KK Goldstone bosons in the compactified 5d Yang-Mills (YM) theories.
From these, we reconstruct the GET of the KK longitudinal graviton (KK Goldstone) scattering amplitudes
in the 5d General Relativity (GR) from the KK longitudinal gauge boson (KK Goldstone) scattering
amplitudes in the 5d YM theories. Using the GET and the double-copy reconstruction, we provide a
theoretical mechanism showing that the sum of all the energy-power terms [up to $O(E^{10})$] in
the high-energy longitudinal KK graviton scattering amplitudes must cancel down to $O(E^{2})$
as enforced by matching the energy-power dependence in the corresponding gravitational KK Goldstone
amplitudes as well as matching that of the double-copy amplitudes from the KK YM gauge theories.

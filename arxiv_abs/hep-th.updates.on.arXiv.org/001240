We obtain a Lorentz covariant wave equation whose complex wave function transforms under a Lorentz
boost according to the following rule, $\Psi(x)\rightarrow e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}f(x)}\Psi(x)$.
We show that the spacetime dependent phase $f(x)$ is the most natural relativistic extension of
the phase associated with the transformation rule for the non-relativistic Schroedinger wave
function when it is subjected to a Galilean transformation. We then generalize the previous analysis
by postulating that $\Psi(x)$ transforms according to the above rule under proper Lorentz transformations
(boosts or spatial rotations). This is the most general transformation rule compatible with a Lorentz
invariant physical theory whose observables are bilinear functions of the field $\Psi(x)$. We
use the previous wave equations to describe several physical systems. In particular, we solve the
bound state and scattering problems of two particles which interact both electromagnetically
and gravitationally (static electromagnetic and gravitational fields). The former interaction
is modeled via the minimal coupling prescription while the latter enters via an external potential.
We also formulate logically consistent classical and quantum field theories associated with these
Lorentz covariant wave equations. We show that it is possible to make those theories equivalent
to the Klein-Gordon theory whenever we have self-interacting terms that do not break their Lorentz
invariance or if we introduce electromagnetic interactions via the minimal coupling prescription.
For interactions that break Lorentz invariance, we show that the present theories imply that particles
and antiparticles behave differently at decaying processes, with the latter being more unstable.
This suggests a possible connection between Lorentz invariance-breaking interactions and the
matter-antimatter asymmetry problem.

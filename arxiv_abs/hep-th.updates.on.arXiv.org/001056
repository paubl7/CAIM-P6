The ultrashort unitary (4,0) supermultiplet of 6d superconformal algebra OSp(8*|8) reduces to
the CPT-self conjugate supermultiplet of 4d superconformal algebra SU(2,2|8) that represents
the fields of maximal N=8 supergravity. The graviton in the (4,0) multiplet is described by a mixed
tensor gauge field which can not be identified with the standard metric in 6d. Furthermore the (4,0)
supermultiplet can be obtained as a double copy of (2,0) conformal supermultiplet whose interacting
theories are non-Lagrangian. It had been suggested that an interacting non-metric (4,0) supergravity
theory might describe the strongly coupled phase of 5d maximal supergravity. In this paper we study
the implications of the existence of an interacting non-metric (4,0) supergravity in 6d. The (4,0)
theory can be truncated to non-metric (1,0) supergravity coupled to 5,8 and 14 self-dual tensor
multiplets that reduce to three of the unified magical supergravity theories in d=5. This implies
that the three infinite families of unified N=2 , 5d Maxwell-Einstein supergravity theories (MESGTs)
plus two sporadic ones must have uplifts to unified non-metric (1,0) tensor Einstein supergravity
theories in d=6. These theories have non-compact global symmetry groups under which all the self-dual
tensor fields including the gravitensor transform irreducibly. Four of these theories are uplifts
of the magical supergravity theories whose scalar manifolds are symmetric spaces. The scalar manifolds
of the other unified theories are not homogeneous spaces. One of the infinite families of MESGTs
can be gauged to obtain an infinite family of unified Yang-Mills Einstein supergravity theories
in d=5. Hence corresponding non-metric (1,0) tensor Einstein supergravity theories must admit
non-Abelian couplings while preserving their unified property.

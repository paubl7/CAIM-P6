Spontaneous symmetry breaking is the foundation of electroweak unification and serves as an integral
part of the model building beyond the standard model of particle physics and it also finds interesting
applications in the late Universe. We review development related to obtaining the late cosmic acceleration
from spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Universe at large scales. This phenomenon is best understood
through Ginzburg-Landau theory of phase transitions which we briefly describe. Hereafter, we
present elements of spontaneous symmetry breaking in relativistic field theory. We then discuss
the "symmetron" scenario-based upon symmetry breaking in the late Universe which is realized by
using a specific form of conformal coupling. However, the model is faced with "NO GO" for late time
acceleration due to local gravity constraints. We argue that the problem can be circumvented by
using the massless $\lambda \phi^4$ theory coupled to massive neutrino matter. As for the early
Universe, spontaneous symmetry breaking finds its interesting applications in the study of electroweak
phase transition. To this effect, we first discuss in detail, the Ginzburg-Landau theory of first
order phase transitions and then apply it to electroweak phase transition including technical
discussions on bubble nucleation and sphaleron transitions. We provide a pedagogical expositions
of dynamics of electroweak phase transition and emphasize the need to go beyond the standard model
of particle physics for addressing the baryogenesis problem. Review ends with a brief discussion
on Affleck-Dine mechanism and spontaneous baryogenesis. Appendixes include technical details
on essential ingredients of baryogenesis, sphaleron solution, one loop finite temperature effective
potential and dynamics of bubble nucleation.

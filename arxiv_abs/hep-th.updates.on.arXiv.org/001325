The theory for the vanishing of N\'eel order in the spin $S=1/2$ square lattice antiferromagnet
has been the focus of attention for many decades. A consensus appears to have emerged in recent numerical
studies on the antiferromagnet with first and second neighbor exchange interactions (the $J_1$-$J_2$
model): a gapless spin liquid is present for a narrow window of parameters between the vanishing
of the N\'eel order and the onset of a gapped valence bond solid state. We propose a deconfined critical
SU(2) gauge theory for a transition into a stable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid with massless Dirac
spinon excitations; on the other side the critical point, the SU(2) spin liquid (the `$\pi$-flux'
phase) is presumed to be unstable to confinement to the N\'eel phase. We identify a dangerously irrelevant
coupling in the critical SU(2) gauge theory, which contributes a logarithm-squared renormalization.
This critical theory is also not Lorentz invariant, and weakly breaks the SO(5) symmetry which rotates
between the N\'eel and valence bond solid order parameters. We also propose a distinct deconfined
critical U(1) gauge theory for a transition into the same gapless $\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid; on
the other side of the critical point, the U(1) spin liquid (the `staggered flux' phase) is presumed
to be unstable to confinement to the valence bond solid. This critical theory has no dangerously
irrelevant coupling, dynamic critical exponent $z \neq 1$, and no SO(5) symmetry. All of these phases
and critical points are unified in a SU(2) gauge theory with Higgs fields and fermionic spinons which
can naturally realize the observed sequence of phases with increasing $J_2/J_1$: N\'eel, gapless
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ spin liquid, and valence bond solid.

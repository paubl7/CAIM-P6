This thesis presents the general structure of non-conformal higher-spin supercurrent multiplets
in three and four spacetime dimensions. Such supercurrents are in one-to-one correspondence with
off-shell massless higher-spin gauge supermultiplets, some of which are constructed in this thesis
for the first time. In the first part of the thesis, we propose a new off-shell formulation for a massless
integer superspin multiplet, whose gauge-invariant action involves an unconstrained complex
superconformal prepotential, in conjunction with two types of compensators. Next, we deduce the
structure of consistent non-conformal higher-spin ${\cal N}=1$ supercurrents. Explicit expressions
for such supercurrents are derived for various theories in 4D ${\cal N}=1$ Minkowski and AdS superspaces.
These include a model of $N$ massive chiral superfields with an arbitrary mass matrix, along with
free theories of tensor and complex linear superfields. The second part of the thesis is devoted
to ${\cal N}=1$ and ${\cal N}=2$ supersymmetric higher-spin theories in 3D AdS space. Two dually
equivalent off-shell Lagrangian formulations for the massless multiplets of arbitrary superspin
in (1,1) AdS superspace and their corresponding supercurrents are derived. With regards to (2,0)
AdS supersymmetry, we identify a multiplet of conserved higher-spin currents in models for a chiral
superfield, which is then used to construct two series of a massless half-integer superspin multiplet.
Finally, our (2,0) AdS supermultiplets are reduced to (1,0) AdS superspace, yielding four series
of ${\cal N}=1$ supersymmetric higher-spin models. Further applications of these massless models
are discussed, one of which is related to the construction of two new off-shell formulations for
the massive ${\cal N}=1$ gravitino supermultiplet in AdS.

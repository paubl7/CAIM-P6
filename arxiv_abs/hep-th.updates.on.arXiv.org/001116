In this paper we prove that points in the space $X(k,n)$ of configurations of $n$ points in $\mathbb{CP}^{k-1}$
which are fixed under a certain cyclic action are the solutions to the generalized scattering equations
on planar kinematics (PK). In the first part, we give a constructive upper bound: we show that these
solutions inject into certain aperiodic k-element subsets of $\{1,\ldots, n\}$, and consequently
that their number is bounded above by the number of Lyndon words with k one's and n-k zeros. The proof
uses a somewhat surprising connection between the superpotential of the mirror of $G(n-k,n)$ and
the generalized CHY potential on $X(k,n)$. We also check the recent conjecture that generalized
biadjoint amplitudes evaluate to $k$-dimensional Catalan numbers on PK for several examples including
$k=3$ and $n\leq 40$ and $(k,n)=(6,13)$. We then reformulate the CEGM generalized biadjoint scalar
amplitude directly as a Laplace transform-type integral over ${\rm Trop}^+ G(k,n)$ and we use it
to evaluate the amplitude on PK with the purpose of exhibiting how GFD's glue together. We initiate
the study of two minimal lattice polytopal neighborhoods of the planar kinematics point. One of
these, the rank-graded root polytope $\mathcal{R}_{k,n}$, in the case $k=2$, is a projection of
the standard type A root polytope. The other, denoted $\Pi_{k,n}$, in the case $k=2$, is a degeneration
of the associahedron. We check up to and including $\mathcal{R}_{3,9}$ and $\mathcal{R}_{4,9}$
that the relative volume of $\mathcal{R}_{k,n}$ is the multi-dimensional Catalan number $C^{(k)}_{n-k}$,
hinting towards the possibility of deeper geometric and combinatorial interpretations of $m^{(k)}(\mathbb{I}_n,\mathbb{I}_n)$
near the PK point.

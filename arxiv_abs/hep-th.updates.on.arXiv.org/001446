A holographic computation of $T_c$ at ${\it intermediate\ coupling}$ from M-theory dual of thermal
QCD-like theories, has been missing in the literature. Filling this gap, we demonstrate a novel
UV-IR mixing, (conjecture and provide evidence for) a non-renormalization beyond 1 loop of ${\bf
M}-{\bf c}$hiral perturbation theory arXiv:2011.04660[hep-th]-compatible deconfinement
${\bf T}$emperature, and show equivalence with an ${\bf E}$ntanglement (as well as Wald) entropy
arXiv:0709.2140[hep-th] computation, up to terms ${\bf Q}$uartic in curvature. We demonstrate
a ${\bf F}$lavor-${\bf M}$emory (FM) effect in the M-theory uplifts of the gravity duals, wherein
the no-braner M-theory uplift retains the "memory" of the flavor D7-branes of the parent type IIB
dual in the sense that a specific combination of the aforementioned quartic corrections to the metric
components precisely along the compact part of the non-compact four-cycle "wrapped" by the flavor
D7-branes, is what determines, e.g., the Einstein-Hilbert action at O$(R^4)$. The same linear
combination of O$(R^4)$ metric corrections, upon matching the phenomenological value of the coupling
constant of one of the SU(3) NLO ChPT Lagrangian, is required to have a definite sign. Interestingly,
in the decompactification limit of the spatial circle, we ${\it derive}$ this, and obtain the values
of the relevant O$(R^4)$ metric corrections. Further, equivalence with Wald entropy for the black
hole at ${\cal O}(R^4)$ imposes a linear constraint on the same linear combination of metric corrections.
Remarkably, when evaluating $T_c$ from an entanglement entropy computation in the thermal gravity
dual, due to a delicate cancelation between the ${\cal O}(R^4)$ corrections from a subset of the
abovementioned metric components, one sees that there are no corrections to $T_c$ at quartic order
supporting the conjecture referred to above.

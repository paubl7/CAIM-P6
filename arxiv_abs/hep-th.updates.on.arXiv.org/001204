We argue that the exact gauge symmetry of the QCD Lagrangian does not coincide with the symmetry of
its ground state. The dynamical source of this breakdown has been identified with the tadpole/seagull
term, which renormalized version called, the mass gap. It is explicitly present in the full gluon
self-energy. The true dynamical role of the mass gap was hidden in the QCD ground state. To disclose
it the splintering between the transverse conditions for the full gluon self-energy and its subtracted
counterpart has been derived. We have established the equation of motion for the full gluon propagator
on account of the mass gap with a newly-derived generalized gauge. It is uniquely fixed as a function
of the gluon momentum. All this makes it possible to present novel non-perturbative analytical
approach to QCD, which we call the mass gap approach. It allows to extend the mass gap concept to be
accounted for the QCD ground state as well. We have discovered the non-perturbative singular solution
for the full gluon propagator valid in the whole gluon momentum range, while dominating at large
distances (small gluon momenta) over all the other possible solutions. It accommodates all the
severe infrared singularities (when the gluon momenta go to zero), which may appear in the QCD ground
state due to the self-interaction of massless gluon modes. We developed the theoretical formalism
how to put them under a firm mathematical control. Despite the exact gauge symmetry is broken in the
ground state, the renormalizability of the theory is not affected. For this the corresponding non-pertubative
multiplicative infrared renormalization program has been formulated. The resulting full gluon
propagator prevents gluons to appear at large distances as physical states (confinement of color
gluons).

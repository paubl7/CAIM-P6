We argue that strings (vortices) and monopoles are confined, when fields receiving nontrivial
Aharonov-Bohm (AB) phases around a string develop vacuum expectation values (VEVs). We illustrate
this in an $SU(2) \times U(1)$ gauge theory with charged triplet complex scalar fields admitting
Alice strings and monopoles, by introducing charged doublet scalar fields receiving nontrivial
AB phases around the Alice string. The Alice string carries a half $U(1)$ magnetic flux and $1/4$
$SU(2)$ magnetic flux taking a value in two of the $SU(2)$ generators characterizing the $U(1)$
modulus. This string is not confined in the absence of a doublet VEV in the sense that the $SU(2)$ magnetic
flux can be detected at large distance by an AB phase around the string. When the doublet field develops
VEVs, there appear two kinds of phases that we call deconfined and confined phases. When a single
Alice string is present in the deconfined phase, the $U(1)$ modulus of the string and the vacuum moduli
are locked (the bulk-soliton moduli locking). In the confined phase, the Alice string is inevitably
attached by a domain wall that we call an AB defect and is confined with an anti-Alice string or another
Alice string with the same $SU(2)$ flux. Depending on the partner, the pair annihilates or forms
a stable doubly-wound Alice string having an $SU(2)$ magnetic flux inside the core, whose color
cannot be detected at large distance by AB phases, implying the "color" confinement. The theory
also admits stable Abrikosov-Nielsen-Olesen string and a ${\mathbb Z}_2$ string in the absence
of the doublet VEVs, and each decays into two Alice strings in the presence of the doublet VEVs. A monopole
in this theory can be constructed as a closed Alice string with the $U(1)$ modulus twisted once, and
we show that with the doublet VEVs, monopoles are also confined to monopole mesons of the monopole
charge two.

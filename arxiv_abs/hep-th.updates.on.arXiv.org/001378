We systematically study the anomaly inflow by the bulk Chern-Simons (CS) theory in a slice of five-dimensional
anti-de Sitter spacetime ($\text{AdS}_5$). The introduction of UV and IR 3-branes makes the anomaly
story remarkably rich and many interesting aspects can be obtained, including weakly gauging and
spontaneous symmetry breaking of the global symmetries of the dual 4D CFT. Our main contribution
is to provide a unified and comprehensive discussion of the subject, together with a detailed description
of the dual CFT picture for each case. Employing a gauge-fixed effective action suitable for a holographic
study, we reproduce many known results in the literature, such as 't Hooft anomaly matching for unbroken
symmetry (Neumann IR-BC) and (gauged) Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) action for broken symmetry (IR-BC
breaks the bulk group $G \to H$). In addition, we show that anomaly matching occurs for ABJ anomalies
as well as 't Hooft anomalies, which suggests anomalies inflowed from the bulk CS theory are necessarily
free of mixed anomalies with the confining gauge force of the 4D dual CFT. In the case of broken symmetry,
we prove that the "would-be" Goldstone bosons associated with the weakly gauged symmetry are completely
removed by a proper field redefinition, provided the anomaly from the bulk is exactly cancelled
by the boundary contribution, hence confirming the standard expectation. Moreover, we present
a holographic formulation of Witten's argument for the quantization condition for the WZW action,
and argue in favor of an alternative way to obtain the same condition using a "deformed" theory (different
BCs). We work out several examples, including a product group with mixed anomaly, and identify the
corresponding dual CFT picture. We consider a fully general case typically arising in the context
of dynamical electroweak symmetry breaking.

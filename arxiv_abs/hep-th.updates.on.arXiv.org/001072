We conducted series of experiments on observing a Stark-type effect in superfluid $^4$He in presence
of relative laminar flows of the normal and superfluid components. It is designed a measurement
cell which allows us to simultaneously create hydrodynamic flows in the liquid and to carry out high-frequency
radio-measurements at external electric field. We used a dielectric disk resonator that made possible
to cover a wide frequency range. In our experiments it was registered the spectrum of the dielectric
disk resonator modes, as well as narrow lines of absorption of a microwave radiation in He II on its
background and in different conditions. We discovered that having in the liquid helium a relative
motion of the normal and superfluid fractions in the temperature range of 1.4$\div$2.17 K the narrow
line of absorption/radiation is observed in the EM spectrum, the frequency of which - 180 GHz - corresponds
to the roton minimum. This line splits in a constant electric field. Note that in a weak electric field
the value of splitting depends linearly on the electric field strength, i.e. the linear Stark effect
is detected. It is found that with the external electric field increasing both split lines are displaced
towards more low frequencies side. The obtained data set could be described by an empirical formula,
taking into account as the linear part of the Stark effect, as well as a quadratic addition, related
to the polarization part. The data point out on having particles or excitations in the liquid helium
with the dipole moment $\sim 10^{-4}$ D, that in four order less of the characteristic dipole moment
of polar molecules. The comparison of our findings to values of the electric dipole moment (EDM)
of elementary particles and nuclei is also performed. We sum up with brief discussion of extensions
of the known theoretical models and possible mechanisms of the EDM production.

The classification scheme for rational conformal field theories, given by the Mathur-Mukhi-Sen
(MMS) program, identifies a rational conformal field theory by two numbers: $(n, l)$. $n$ is the
number of characters of the rational conformal field theory. The characters form linearly independent
solutions to a modular linear differential equation (which is also labelled by $(n, l)$); the Wronskian
index $l$ is a non-negative integer associated to the structure of zeroes of the Wronskian. In this
paper, we compute the $(n, l)$ values for three classes of well-known CFTs viz. the WZW CFTs, the Virasoro
minimal models and the $\mathcal{N} = 1$ super-Virasoro minimal models. For the latter two, we obtain
exact formulae for the Wronskian indices. For WZW CFTs, we get exact formulae for small ranks (upto
2) and all levels and for all ranks and small levels (upto 2) and for the rest we compute using a computer
program. We find that any WZW CFT at level 1 has a vanishing Wronskian index as does the $\mathbf{\hat{A}_1}$
CFT at all levels. We find intriguing coincidences such as: (i) for the same level CFTs with $\mathbf{\hat{A}_2}$
and $\mathbf{\hat{G}_2}$ have the same $(n,l)$ values, (ii) for the same level CFTs with $\mathbf{\hat{B}_r}$
and $\mathbf{\hat{D}_r}$ have the same $(n,l)$ values for all $r \geq 5$. Classifying all rational
conformal field theories for a given $(n, l)$ is one of the aims of the MMS program. We can use our computations
to provide partial classifications. For the famous $(2, 0)$ case, our partial classification turns
out to be the full classification (achieved by MMS three decades ago). For the $(3, 0)$ case, our partial
classification includes two infinite series of CFTs as well as seven ``discrete'' CFTs; except
two all others have Kac-Moody symmetry.

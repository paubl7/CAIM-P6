Let $(X,g)$ be a compact manifold with boundary $M^n$ and $\sigma$ a defining function of $M$. To
these data, we associate conformally covariant polynomial one-parameter families of differential
operators $C^\infty(X) \to C^\infty(M)$. They arise through a residue construction which generalizes
an earlier construction in the framework of Poincar\'e-Einstein metrics and are referred to as
residue families. The main ingredient of the definition of these families are eigenfunctions of
the Laplacian of the singular metric $\sigma^{-2}g$. We prove that, if $\sigma$ is an approximate
solution of a singular Yamabe problem, i.e., if $\sigma^{-2}g$ has constant scalar curvature $-n(n+1)$
up to a sufficiently small remainder, these families can be written as compositions of certain degenerate
Laplacians (Laplace-Robin operators). This shows that the notions of extrinsic conformal Laplacians
and extrinsic $Q$-curvature introduced in recent works by Gover and Waldron naturally can be rephrased
in terms of residue families. This new spectral theoretical perspective allows easy new proofs
of results of Gover and Waldron. Moreover, it enables us to relate the extrinsic conformal Laplacians
and the critical extrinsic $Q$-curvature to the scattering operator of the asymptotically hyperbolic
metric $\sigma^{-2}g$ extending work of Graham and Zworski. The relation to the scattering operators
implies that the exterior conformal Laplacians are self-adjoint. We also derive new local holographic
formulas for all extrinsic $Q$-curvatures. Furthermore, we prove a new formula for the singular
Yamabe obstruction $B_n$. We use this formula for $B_n$ to derive explicit expressions for the obstructions
in low-order cases (confirming earlier results). Finally, we relate the obstruction $B_n$ to the
supercritical $Q$-curvature $Q_{n+1}$.

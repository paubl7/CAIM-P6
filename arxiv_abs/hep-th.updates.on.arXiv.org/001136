We provide a simple geometric meaning for deformations of so-called $T{\overline T}$ type in relativistic
and non-relativistic systems. Deformations by the cross products of energy and momentum currents
in integrable quantum field theories are known to modify the thermodynamic Bethe ansatz equations
by a "CDD factor". In turn, CDD factors may be interpreted as additional, fixed shifts incurred in
scattering processes: a finite width added to the fundamental particles (or, if negative, to the
free space between them). We suggest that this physical effect is a universal way of understanding
$T{\overline T}$ deformations, both in classical and quantum systems. We first show this in non-relativistic
systems, with particle conservation and translation invariance, using the deformation formed
out of the densities and currents of particles and momentum. This holds at the level of the equations
of motion, and for any interaction potential, integrable or not. We then argue, and show by similar
techniques in free relativistic particle systems, that $T\overline T$ deformations of relativistic
systems produce the equivalent phenomenon, accounting for length contractions. We also show that,
in both the relativistic and non-relativistic cases, the width of particles is equivalent to a state-dependent
change of metric, where the distance function discounts the particles' widths, or counts the additional
free space. This generalises and explains the known field-dependent coordinate change describing
$T\overline T$ deformations. The results connect such deformations with generalised hydrodynamics,
where the relations between scattering shifts, widths of particles and state-dependent changes
of metric have been established.

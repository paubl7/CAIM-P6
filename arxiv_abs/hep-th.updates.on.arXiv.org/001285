Starting from nonequilibrium quantum field theory on a closed time path, we derive kinetic equations
for the strong-field regime of quantum electrodynamics (QED) using a systematic expansion in the
gauge coupling $e$. The strong field regime is characterized by a large photon field of order $\mathcal{O}(1/e)$,
which is relevant for the description of, e.g., intense laser fields, the initial stages of off-central
heavy ion collisions, and condensed matter systems with net fermion number. The strong field enters
the dynamical equations via both quantum Vlasov- and collision terms, which we derive to order $\mathcal{O}(e^2)$.
The strong-field scattering kernel couples the transport equations to an equation for the fermion
spectral function. The description includes single photon emission, electron-positron pair
photoproduction, vacuum (Schwinger) pair production, their inverse processes, medium effects
and contributions from the field, which are not restricted to the so-called locally-constant crossed
field approximation. This extends known kinetic equations commonly used in strong-field QED of
intense laser fields. In particular, we propose an expression for an asymptotic fermion pair number
that remains valid for strongly inhomogeneous fields. For the purpose of analytically highlighting
limiting cases, we also consider plane-wave fields. A plane-wave particle picture is identified
and it is shown how to recover Furry-picture scattering amplitudes by further assuming negligible
occupations. Known on-shell descriptions are recovered for the case of simply peaked ultrarelativistic
fermion occupations. Collisional strong-field equations are necessary to describe the dynamics
to thermal equilibrium starting from strong-field initial conditions.

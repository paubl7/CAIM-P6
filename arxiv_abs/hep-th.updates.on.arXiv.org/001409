We study massless 1-dimensional Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonians, that is, operators on the half-line
of the form $D_{\omega,\lambda}:=\begin{bmatrix} -\frac{\lambda+\omega}{x} & - \partial_x
\\ \partial_x & -\frac{\lambda-\omega}{x} \end{bmatrix}$. We describe their closed realizations
in the sense of the Hilbert space $L^2(\mathbb R_+,\mathbb C^2)$, allowing for complex values of
the parameters $\lambda,\omega$. In physical situations, $\lambda$ is proportional to the electric
charge and $\omega$ is related to the angular momentum. We focus on realizations of $D_{\omega,\lambda}$
homogeneous of degree $-1$. They can be organized in a single holomorphic family of closed operators
parametrized by a certain 2-dimensional complex manifold. We describe the spectrum and the numerical
range of these realizations. We give an explicit formula for the integral kernel of their resolvent
in terms of Whittaker functions. We also describe their stationary scattering theory, providing
formulas for a natural pair of diagonalizing operators and for the scattering operator. It is well-known
that $D_{\omega,\lambda}$ arise after separation of variables of the Dirac-Coulomb operator
in dimension 3. We give a simple argument why this is still true in any dimension. Our work is mainly
motivated by a large literature devoted to distinguished self-adjoint realizations of Dirac-Coulomb
Hamiltonians. We show that these realizations arise naturally if the holomorphy is taken as the
guiding principle. Furthermore, they are infrared attractive fixed points of the scaling action.
Beside applications in relativistic quantum mechanics, Dirac-Coulomb Hamiltonians are argued
to provide a natural setting for the study of Whittaker (or, equivalently, confluent hypergeometric)
functions.

We identify a nontrivial yet tractable quantum field theory model with space/time anisotropic
scale invariance, for which one can exactly compute certain four-point correlation functions
and their decompositions via the operator-product expansion(OPE). The model is the Calogero model,
non-relativistic particles interacting with a pair potential $\frac{g}{|x-y|^2}$ in one dimension,
considered as a quantum field theory in one space and one time dimension via the second quantisation.
This model has the anisotropic scale symmetry with the anisotropy exponent $z=2$. The symmetry
is also enhanced to the Schr\"odinger symmetry. The model has one coupling constant $g$ and thus
provides an example of a fixed line in the renormalisation group flow of anisotropic theories. We
exactly compute a nontrivial four-point function of the fundamental fields of the theory. We decompose
the four-point function via OPE in two different ways, thereby explicitly verifying the associativity
of OPE for the first time for an interacting quantum field theory with anisotropic scale invariance.
From the decompositions, one can read off the OPE coefficients and the scaling dimensions of the
operators appearing in the intermediate channels. One of the decompositions is given by a convergent
series, and only one primary operator and its descendants appear in the OPE. The scaling dimension
of the primary operator we computed depends on the coupling constant. The dimension correctly reproduces
the value expected from the well-known spectrum of the Calogero model combined with the so-called
state-operator map which is valid for theories with the Schr\"odinger symmetry. The other decomposition
is given by an asymptotic series. The asymptotic series comes with exponentially small correction
terms, which also has a natural interpretation in terms of OPE.

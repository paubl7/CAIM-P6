In this thesis we describe high-harmonic cosmic string loops in a general relativistic context,
and study the implications of high-harmonic content for the predicted gravitational wave signal
from cosmic string networks. Initially, we introduce the variational principle, spacetime concepts
and other mathematical tools that we will need for the calculations in the following chapters. We
introduce the FLRW universe and the $\Lambda CDM$ universe. We then describe the Nambu-Goto cosmic
string in a curved spacetime, its equations of motion and its energy-momentum tensor. Fixing the
spacetime to be flat, and fixing the gauge, we find the motion of the cosmic string and we present and
discuss special solutions. Using the odd-harmonic family of cosmic string loops, we calculate
the number of cusps per period and the values of the second derivatives of the left- and right-moving
harmonic modes at the cusp, and study their dependence on the harmonic order. We then develop a toy
model that calculates the stable daughter loops produced from a parent loop using a statistical
approach based on a binary tree description of the loop chopping. We also use the toy model to calculate
the average number of cusps produced from a system of loops that self intersect over their course
of existence. We derive the gravitational waveform emitted from a cusp as observed away from the
cusp, in any direction of observation. We then propagate this result in an FLRW spacetime to reach
an expression of its amplitude on Earth. Assuming two different cosmic string network models, we
implement our above mentioned high-harmonic results to find the amplitude of the signal and the
rate at which these signals reach an observer on Earth.

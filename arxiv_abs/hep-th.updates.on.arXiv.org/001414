Starting with QCD, we derive an effective field theory description for forward scattering and factorization
violation as part of the soft-collinear effective field theory (SCET) for high energy scattering.
These phenomena are mediated by long distance Glauber gluon exchanges, which are static in time,
localized in the longitudinal distance, where $|t| \ll s$. In hard scattering, Glauber gluons can
induce corrections which invalidate factorization. With SCET, Glauber exchange graphs can be
calculated explicitly, and are distinct from graphs with soft, collinear, or ultrasoft gluons.
We derive a complete basis of operators which describe the leading power effects of Glauber exchange.
Key ingredients include regulating light-cone rapidity singularities and subtractions which
prevent double counting. Our results include a novel all orders gauge invariant pure glue soft operator
which appears between two collinear rapidity sectors. The 1-gluon Feynman rule for the soft operator
coincides with the Lipatov vertex, but it also contributes to emissions with $\ge 2$ soft gluons.
Our Glauber operator basis is derived using tree level and one-loop matching calculations from
full QCD to SCET. The rapidity RGE yields gluon Reggeization at the amplitude level, and gives the
BFKL equation for the soft and collinear functions in the forward scattering cross section. We derive
an explicit rule for when eikonalization is valid, and provide a direct connection to the picture
of multiple Wilson lines crossing a shockwave. In hard scattering operators Glauber subtractions
for soft and collinear loop diagrams ensure that we are not sensitive to the directions for soft and
collinear Wilson lines. Conversely, certain Glauber interactions can be absorbed into these soft
and collinear Wilson lines by taking them to be in specific directions. We also discuss criteria
for factorization violation.

A stealth de Sitter solution in scalar-tensor theories has an exact de Sitter background metric
and a nontrivial scalar field profile. Recently, in the context of Degenerate Higher-Order Scalar-Tensor
(DHOST) theories it was shown that stealth de Sitter solutions suffer from either infinite strong
coupling or gradient instability for scalar field perturbations. The sound speed squared is either
vanishing or negative. In the first case, the strong coupling scale is zero and thus lower than the
energy scale of any physical phenomena. From the viewpoint of effective field theory, this issue
is naturally resolved by introducing a controlled detuning of the degeneracy condition dubbed
scordatura, recovering a version of ghost condensation. In this paper we construct a viable dark
energy model in the scordatura DHOST theory based on a stealth cosmological solution, in which the
metric is the same as in the standard $\Lambda$CDM model and the scalar field profile is linearly
time-dependent. We show that the scordatura mechanism resolves the strong coupling and gradient
instability. Further, we find that the scordatura is also necessary to make the quasi-static limit
well-defined, which implies that the subhorizon observables are inevitably affected by the scordatura.
We derive the effective gravitational coupling and the correction to the friction term for the subhorizon
evolution of the linear dark matter energy density contrast as well as the Weyl potential and the
gravitational slip parameter. In the absence of the scordatura, the quasi-static approximation
would break down at all scales around stealth cosmological solutions even if the issue of the infinite
strong coupling is unjustly disregarded. Therefore previous estimations of the subhorizon evolution
of matter density contrast in modified gravity in the literature need to be revisited by taking into
account the scordatura effect.

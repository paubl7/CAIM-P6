We study gravitational particle production of the massive spin-$3/2$ Rarita-Schwinger field,
and its close relative, the gravitino, in FRW cosmological spacetimes. For masses lighter than
the value of the Hubble expansion rate after inflation, $m_{3/2} \lesssim H$, we find catastrophic
gravitational particle production, wherein the number of gravitationally produced particles
is divergent, caused by a transient vanishing of the helicity-1/2 gravitino sound speed. In contrast
with the conventional gravitino problem, the spectrum of produced particles is dominated by those
with momentum at the UV cutoff. This suggests a breakdown of effective field theory, which might
be cured by new degrees of freedom that emerge in the UV. We study the UV completion of the Rarita-Schwinger
field, namely ${\cal N}=1$, $d=4$, supergravity. We reproduce known results for models with a single
superfield and models with an arbitrary number of chiral superfields, find a simple geometric expression
for the sound speed in the latter case, and extend this to include nilpotent constrained superfields
and orthogonal constrained superfields. We find supergravity models where the catastrophe is
cured and models where it persists. Insofar as quantizing the gravitino is tantamount to quantizing
gravity, as is the case in any UV completion of supergravity, the models exhibiting catastrophic
production are prime examples of 4-dimensional effective field theories that become inconsistent
when gravity is quantized, suggesting a possible link to the Swampland program. We propose the Gravitino
Swampland Conjecture, which is consistent with and indeed follows from the KKLT and Large Volume
scenarios for moduli stabilization in string theory.

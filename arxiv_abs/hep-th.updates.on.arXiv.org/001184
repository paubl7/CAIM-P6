We propose a new model of the spherical symmetric quantum black hole in the reduced phase space formulation.
We deparametrize gravity by coupling to the Gaussian dust which provides the material coordinates.
The foliation by dust coordinates covers both the interior and exterior of the black hole. After
the spherical symmetry reduction, our model is a 1+1 dimensional field theory containing infinitely
many degrees of freedom. The effective dynamics of the quantum black hole is generated by an improved
physical Hamiltonian ${\bf H}_\Delta$ where the holonomy correction is implemented by the $\bar{\mu}$-scheme
regularization with a Planckian area scale $\Delta$. The effective dynamics recovers the semiclassical
Schwarzschild geometry at low curvature regime and resolves the black hole singularity with Planckian
curvature. Our model predicts that the evolution of the black hole at late time reaches the charged
Nariai geometry ${\rm dS}_2\times S^2$ with Planckian radii. The Nariai geometry is stable under
linear perturbations but may be unstable by nonperturbative quantum effects. Our model suggests
the existence of quantum tunneling of the Nariai geometry and a scenario of black-hole-to-white-hole
transition. During the transition, the linear perturbations exhibit chaotic dynamics with Lyapunov
exponent $\lambda=2\pi T_{\rm dS}\sim \Delta^{-1/2}$ relating to the Hawking temperature $T_{\rm
dS}$ of ${\rm dS}_2$. In addition, the Nariai geometry in our model provides an interesting example
of Wheeler's bag of gold and contains infinitely many infrared soft modes with zero energy density.
These infrared modes span a Hilbert space carrying a representation of 1-dimensional spatial diffeomorphisms
(or the Witt/Virasoro algebra) which are conserved charges of the effective dynamics by ${\bf H}_\Delta$.

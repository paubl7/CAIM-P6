We investigate the asymptotic structure of the free Rarita-Schwinger theory in four spacetime
dimensions at spatial infinity in the Hamiltonian formalism. We impose boundary conditions for
the spin-$3/2$ field that are invariant under an infinite dimensional (abelian) algebra of non-trivial
asymptotic fermionic symmetries. The compatibility of this set of boundary conditions with the
invariance of the theory under Lorentz boosts requires the introduction of boundary degrees of
freedom in the Hamiltonian action, along the lines of electromagnetism. These boundary degrees
of freedom modify the symplectic structure by a surface contribution appearing in addition to the
standard bulk piece. The Poincar\'e transformations have then well-defined (integrable, finite)
canonical generators. Moreover, improper fermionic gauge symmetries, which are also well-defined
canonical transformations, are further enlarged and turn out to be parametrized by three independent
angle-dependent spinor functions at infinity, which lead to an infinite-dimensional fermionic
algebra endowed with a central charge. We extend next the analysis to the supersymmetric spin-$(1,3/2)$
and spin-$(2,3/2)$ multiplets. First, we present the canonical realization of the super-Poincar\'e
algebra on the spin-$(1,3/2)$ multiplet, which is shown to be consistently enhanced by the infinite-dimensional
abelian algebra of angle-dependent bosonic and fermionic improper gauge symmetries associated
with the electromagnetic and the Rarita-Schwinger fields, respectively. A similar analysis of
the spin-$(2,3/2)$ multiplet is then carried out to obtain the canonical realization of the super-Poincar\'e
algebra, consistently enhanced by the abelian improper bosonic gauge transformations of the spin-$2$
field (BMS supertranslations) and the abelian improper fermionic gauge transformations of the
spin-$3/2$ field.

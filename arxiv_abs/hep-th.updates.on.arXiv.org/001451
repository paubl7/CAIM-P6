In this paper, we analyze the Schwarzschild-like wormhole in the Asymptotically Safe Gravity(ASG)
scenario. The ASG corrections are implemented via renormalization group methods, which, as consequence,
provides a new tensor $X_{\mu\nu}$ as a source to improved field equations, and promotes the Newton's
constant into a running coupling constant. In particular, we check whether the radial energy conditions
are satisfied and compare with the results obtained from the usual theory. We show that only in the
particular case of the wormhole being asymptotically flat(Schwarzschild Wormholes) that the
radial energy conditions are satisfied at the throat, depending on the chosen values for its radius
$r_0$. In contrast, in the general Schwarzschild-like case, there is no possibility of the energy
conditions being satisfied nearby the throat, as in the usual case. After that, we calculate the
radial state parameter, $\omega(r)$, in $r_0$, in order to verify what type of cosmologic matter
is allowed at the wormhole throat, and we show that in both cases there is the possibility of the presence
of exotic matter, phantom or quintessence-like matter. Finally, we give the $\omega(r)$ solutions
for all regions of space. Interestingly, we find that Schwarzschild-like Wormholes with excess
of solid angle of the sphere in the asymptotic limit have the possibility of having non-exotic matter
as source for certain values of the radial coordinate $r$. Furthermore, it was observed that quantum
gravity corrections due the ASG necessarily imply regions with phantom-like matter, both for Schwarzschild
and for Schwarzschild-like wormholes. This reinforces the supposition that a phantom fluid is
always present for wormholes in this context.

We show that as a result of the axial anomaly, massless fermions at zero temperature define a relativistic
quantum superfluid. The anomaly pole implies the existence of a gapless Chiral Density Wave (CDW),
i.e. an axion-like acoustic mode of an irrotational and dissipationless Hamiltonian perfect fluid,
that is a correlated fermion/anti-fermion pair excitation of the Fermi-Dirac sea. In $D\!=\!2$
dimensions the chiral superfluid effective action coincides with that of the Schwinger model as
$e\rightarrow 0$, and the CDW acoustic mode is precisely the Schwinger boson. Since this identity
holds also at zero chiral chemical potential, the Dirac vacuum itself may be viewed as a quantum superfluid
state. The CDW collective boson is a $U(1)$ chiral phase field, which is gapless as a result of a novel,
non-linear realization of Goldstone's theorem, extended to this case of symmetry breaking by an
anomaly. A new local form of the axial anomaly bosonic effective action in any $D$ even spacetime
is given, consistent with superfluidity, and its quantization is shown to be required by the anomalous
Schwinger terms in fermion current commutators. In QED$_4$ this collective Goldstone mode appears
as a massless pole in the axial anomaly triangle diagram, and is responsible for the macroscopic
non-dissipative currents of the Chiral Magnetic and Chiral Separation Effects, as well as the Anomalous
Hall Effect. In a constant uniform magnetic field an exact dimensional reduction from $D\!=\!4$
to $D\!=\!2$ occurs and the collective $e^+e^-$ CDW chiral pair excitation propagating along the
magnetic field direction is a Chiral Magnetic Wave, which acquires a mass gap $M^2\!=\! e^{3}B/2\pi^{2}$.
Possible realizations and tests of the theory of collective bosonic excitations due to the anomaly
in Dirac/Weyl materials are briefly discussed.

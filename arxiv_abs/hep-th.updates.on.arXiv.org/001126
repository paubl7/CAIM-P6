A method to unitarize the scattering amplitude produced by infinite-range forces is developed
and applied to Born terms. In order to apply $S$-matrix techniques, based on unitarity and analyticity,
we first derive an $S$-matrix free of infrared divergences. This is achieved by removing a divergent
phase factor due to the interactions mediated by the massless particles in the crossed channels,
a procedure that is related to previous formalisms to treat infrared divergences. We apply this
method in detail by unitarizing the Born terms for graviton-graviton scattering in pure gravity
and we find a scalar graviton-graviton resonance with vacuum quantum numbers ($J^{PC}=0^{++}$)
that we call the \textit{graviball}. Remarkably, this resonance is located below the Planck mass
but deep in the complex $s$-plane (with $s$ the usual Mandelstam variable), so that its effects along
the physical real $s$ axis peak for values significantly lower than this scale. We argue that the
position and width of the graviball are reduced when including extra light fields in the theory.
This could lead to phenomenological consequences in scenarios of quantum gravity with a large number
of such fields or, in general, with a low-energy ultraviolet completion. We also apply this formalism
to two non-relativistic potentials with exact known solutions for the scattering amplitudes:
Coulomb scattering and an energy-dependent potential obtained from the Coulomb one with a zero
at threshold. This latter case shares the same $J=0$ partial-wave projected Born term as the graviton-graviton
case, except for a global factor. We find that the relevant resonance structure of these examples
is reproduced by our methods, which represents a strong indication of their robustness.

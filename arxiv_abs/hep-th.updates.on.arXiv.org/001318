The string and brane tensions do not have to be put in by hand, they can be dynamically generated, as
in the case when we formulate string and brane theories in the modified measure formalism. Then string
and brane tensions appears, but as an additional dynamical degree of freedom . It can be seen however
that these string or brane tensions are not universal, but rather each string and each brane generates
its own tension, which can have a different value for each string or brane. We define a new background
fields that can couple to this new type of extended objects, the tension scalar is capable of changing
locally along the world sheet the value of the tension of the extended object. When many strings probing
the same region of space are considered this tension scalar is constrained by the requirement of
quantum conformal invariance. For the case of two strings probing the same region of space with different
dynamically generated tensions, there are two different metrics, associated to the different
strings, that have to satisfy vacuum Einstein equations and the consistency of these two Einstein
equation determines the tension scalar. The universal metric, common to both strings generically
does not satisfy Einstein equation . The problem is analyzed for Schwarzschild background and for
Kasner type space, for the Milne representation, for the case of two types of string tensions, with
solutions with negative string tension at the early universe and a positive string tension that
appears for the late universe . The universal metric is not flat, instead it represents a non singular
bounce cosmology. The case in a warped space time where positive and and negative string tensions
are separated by a spontaneously generated wall is also studied.

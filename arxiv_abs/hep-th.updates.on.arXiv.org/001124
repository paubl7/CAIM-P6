We establish a connection between time evolution of free Fermi droplets and partition function
of \emph{generalised} \emph{q}-deformed Yang-Mills theories on Riemann surfaces. Classical
phases of $(0+1)$ dimensional unitary matrix models can be characterised by free Fermi droplets
in two dimensions. We quantise these droplets and find that the modes satisfy an abelian Kac-Moody
algebra. The Hilbert spaces $\mathcal{H}_+$ and $\mathcal{H}_-$ associated with the upper and
lower free Fermi surfaces of a droplet admit a Young diagram basis in which the phase space Hamiltonian
is diagonal with eigenvalue, in the large $N$ limit, equal to the quadratic Casimir of $u(N)$. We
establish an exact mapping between states in $\mathcal{H}_\pm$ and geometries of droplets. In
particular, coherent states in $\mathcal{H}_\pm$ correspond to classical deformation of upper
and lower Fermi surfaces. We prove that correlation between two coherent states in $\mathcal{H}_\pm$
is equal to the chiral and anti-chiral partition function of $2d$ Yang-Mills theory on a cylinder.
Using the fact that the full Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}_+ \otimes \mathcal{H}_-$ admits a \emph{composite}
basis, we show that correlation between two classical droplet geometries is equal to the full $U(N)$
Yang-Mills partition function on cylinder. We further establish a connection between higher point
correlators in $\mathcal{H}_\pm$ and higher point correlators in $2d$ Yang-Mills on Riemann surface.
There are special states in $\mathcal{H}_\pm$ whose transition amplitudes are equal to the partition
function of $2d$ \emph{q}-deformed Yang-Mills and in general character expansion of Villain action.
We emphasise that the \emph{q}-deformation in the Yang-Mills side is related to special deformation
of droplet geometries without deforming the gauge group associated with the matrix model.

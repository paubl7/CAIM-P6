Crossing symmetry asserts that particles are indistinguishable from anti-particles traveling
back in time. In quantum field theory, this statement translates to the long-standing conjecture
that probabilities for observing the two scenarios in a scattering experiment are described by
one and the same function. Why could we expect it to be true? In this work we examine this question in
a simplified setup and take steps towards illuminating a possible physical interpretation of crossing
symmetry. To be more concrete, we consider planar scattering amplitudes involving any number of
particles with arbitrary spins and masses to all loop orders in perturbation theory. We show that
by deformations of the external momenta one can smoothly interpolate between pairs of crossing
channels without encountering singularities or violating mass-shell conditions and momentum
conservation. The analytic continuation can be realized using two types of moves. The first one
makes use of an $i\varepsilon$ prescription for avoiding singularities near the physical kinematics
and allows us to adjust the momenta of the external particles relative to one another within their
lightcones. The second, more violent, step involves a rotation of subsets of particle momenta via
their complexified lightcones from the future to the past and vice versa. We show that any singularity
along such a deformation would have to correspond to two beams of particles scattering off each other.
For planar Feynman diagrams, these kinds of singularities are absent because of the particular
flow of energies through their propagators. We prescribe a five-step sequence of such moves that
combined together proves crossing symmetry for planar scattering amplitudes in perturbation
theory, paving a way towards settling this question for more general scattering processes in quantum
field theories.

Motivated by the study of physical models associated with General Relativity, we review some finite-dimensional,
geometric and covariant formulations that allow us to characterize in a simple manner the symmetries
for classical field theory by implementing an appropriate fibre-bundle structure, either at the
Lagrangian, the multisymplectic or the polysymplectic levels. In particular, we are able to formulate
Noether's theorems by means of the covariant momentum maps and to systematically introduce a covariant
Poisson-Hamiltonian framework. Also, by focusing on the space plus time decomposition for a generic
classical field theory and its relation to these geometric formulations, we are able to successfully
recover the gauge content and the true local degrees of freedom for the theory. In order to illustrate
the relevance of these geometric frameworks, we center our attention to the analysis of a model for
$3$-dimensional theory of General Relativity that involves an arbitrary Immirzi-like parameter.
At the Lagrangian level, we reproduce the field equations of the system which for this model turn
out to be equivalent to the vanishing torsion condition and the Einstein equations. We also concentrate
on the analysis of the gauge symmetries of the system in order to obtain the Lagrangian covariant
momentum map associated with the theory and, consequently, its corresponding Noether currents.
Next, we aim our attention to describing how the gauge symmetries of the model yield covariant canonical
transformations on the covariant multimomenta phase-space, thus giving rise to the existence
of a covariant momentum map. Besides, we analyze the physical system under consideration within
the De Donder-Weyl canonical theory implemented at the polysymplectic level, thus establishing
a relation from the covariant momentum map to the conserved currents of the theory.

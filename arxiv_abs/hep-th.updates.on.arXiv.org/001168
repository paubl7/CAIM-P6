After the recent GW170817 event of the two neutron stars merging, many string corrected cosmological
theories confronted the non-viability peril. This was due to the fact that most of these theories
produce massive gravitons primordially. Among these theories were the ones containing a non-minimal
kinetic coupling correction term in the Lagrangian, which belong to a subclass of Horndeski theories.
In this work we demonstrate how these theories may be revived and we show how these theories can produce
primordial gravitational waves with speed $c_T^2=1$ in natural units, thus complying with the
GW170817 event. As we show, if the gravitational action of an Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet theory also
contains a kinetic coupling of the form $\sim \xi(\phi) G^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi$,
the condition of having primordial massless gravitons, or equivalently primordial gravitational
waves with speed $c_T^2=1$ in natural units, results to certain conditions on the scalar field dependent
coupling function of the Gauss-Bonnet term, which is also the non-minimal coupling of the kinetic
coupling. We extensively study the phenomenological implications of such a theory focusing on
the inflationary era, by only assuming slow-roll dynamics for the scalar field. Accordingly, we
briefly study the case that the scalar field evolves in a constant-roll way. By using some illustrative
examples, we demonstrate that the viability of the theoretical framework at hand may easily be achieved.
Also, theories containing terms of the form $\sim \xi(\phi)\Box\phi g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi$
and $\sim \xi(\phi)\left(g^{\mu\nu}\partial_\mu\phi\partial_\nu\phi\right)^2$ also lead
to the same gravitational wave speed as the theory we shall study in this paper, so this covers a larger
class of Horndeski theories.

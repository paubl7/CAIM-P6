A mirror-extended standard model (MESM) is proposed, where the SM sector and its mirror copy have
identical SU(2) X U(1) gauge structure and parameters; the mirror fermion counter-partners have
opposite chiralities. A theory is used that allows obtaining MESM in Minkowski space only if one
starts with an accurate account of gravity and only at the end go to the limit of Minkowski space. The
initial conditions imposed on the inflaton in the T-model inflation provide spontaneous breaking
of left-right symmetry and appearance of the "wrong" signs in the mass terms of the SM and mirror Higgs
fields potentials. The Yukawa coupling constant in the underlying Lagrangian is chosen y\approx10^{-3}
as universal for all generations of charged leptons and up-quarks. As an example, it is shown that
additional dimensionless parameters in the range of width less than 0.5 are enough to obtain the
masses of known charged leptons and up quarks. In this sense, MESM bypasses the problem of the fermion
mass hierarchy. With this choice of parameters, MESM predicts that vacuum expectation value for
the mirror Higgs field is 10^{14} GeV and masses of mirror particles are in the range 10^{8}GeV - 10^{13}GeV.
There is only gravitational interaction between particles of the SM and mirror sectors. Hence,
mirror particles can constitue dark matter. Vacuum is defined as the limiting state realized during
the cosmological evolution of the inflaton and classical Higgs fields, in which the energy stored
in them becomes minimal, providing the maximum possible contribution of these fields to the entropy
of the Universe. This allows one to bypass the cosmological constant problem. Quantum corrections
to MESM cannot interfere with the implementation of the new concept of vacuum proposed in this paper.

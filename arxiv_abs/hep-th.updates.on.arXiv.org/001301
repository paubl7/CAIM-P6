This is my Ph.D. thesis which I am going to defend in 2021, and it is devoted to the study of the geometry
of curved Yang-Mills-Higgs gauge theory (CYMH GT), a theory introduced by Alexei Kotov and Thomas
Strobl. This theory reformulates classical gauge theory, in particular, the Lie algebra (and its
action) is generalized to a Lie algebroid $E$, equipped with a connection $\nabla$, and the field
strength has an extra term $\zeta$. In the classical situation $E$ is an action Lie algebroid, $\nabla$
is then the canonical flat connection with respect to such an $E$, and $\zeta\equiv 0$. The shortened
main results of this Ph.D.thesis are the following; see the abstract in the thesis itself for more
information: 1. Reformulating curved Yang-Mills-Higgs gauge theory, also including a thorough
introduction and a coordinate-free formulation. Especially the infinitesimal gauge transformation
will be generalized to a derivation on vector bundle $V$-valued functionals, induced by a Lie algebroid
connection. 2. We will discuss what type of connection for the definition of the infinitesimal gauge
transformation should be used, and this is argued by studying the commutator of two infinitesimal
gauge transformations, viewed as derivations on $V$-valued functionals. We take the connection
on $W$ then in such a way that the commutator is again an infinitesimal gauge transformation. 3. Defining
an equivalence of CYMH GTs given by a field redefinition. In order to preserve the physics, this equivalence
is constructed in such a way that the Lagrangian of the studied theory is invariant under this field
redefinition. It is then natural to study whether there are equivalence classes admitting representatives
with flat $\nabla$ and/or zero $\zeta$, and we will do so especially for Lie algebra bundles, tangent
bundles and their direct products as Lie algebroids.

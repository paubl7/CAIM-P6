A definition of nonequilibrium free energy $\mathcal{F}_{\textsc{s}}$ is proposed for dynamical
Gaussian quantum open systems strongly coupled to a heat bath and a formal derivation is provided
by way of the generating functional in terms of the coarse-grained effective action and the influence
action. For Gaussian open quantum systems exemplified by the quantum Brownian motion model studied
here, a time-varying effective temperature can be introduced in a natural way, and with it, the nonequilibrium
free energy $\mathcal{F}_{\textsc{s}}$, von Neumann entropy $\mathcal{S}_{vN}$ and internal
energy $\mathcal{U}_{\textsc{s}}$ of the reduced system ($S$) can be defined accordingly. In
contrast to the nonequilibrium free energy found in the literature which references the bath temperature,
the nonequilibrium thermodynamic functions we find here obey the familiar relation $\mathcal{F}_{\textsc{s}}(t)=\mathcal{U}_{\textsc{s}}(t)-
T_{\textsc{eff}} (t)\,\mathcal{S}_{vN}(t)$ {\it at any and all moments of time} in the system's
fully nonequilibrium evolution history. After the system equilibrates they coincide, in the weak
coupling limit, with their counterparts in conventional equilibrium thermodynamics. Since the
effective temperature captures both the state of the system and its interaction with the bath, upon
the system's equilibration, it approaches a value slightly higher than the initial bath temperature.
Notably, it remains nonzero for a zero-temperature bath, signaling the existence of system-bath
entanglement. Reasonably, at high bath temperatures and under ultra-weak couplings, it becomes
indistinguishable from the bath temperature. The nonequilibrium thermodynamic functions and
relations discovered here for dynamical Gaussian quantum systems should open up useful pathways
toward establishing meaningful theories of nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics.

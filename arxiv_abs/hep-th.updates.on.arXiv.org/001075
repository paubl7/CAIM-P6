We provide various aspects of second rank antisymmetric Kalb-Ramond (KR) field in modified theories
of gravity. The KR field energy density is found to decrease with the expansion of our universe at
a faster rate in comparison to radiation and matter components. Thus as the Universe evolves and
cools down, the contribution of the KR field on the evolutionary process reduces significantly,
and at present it almost does not affect the universe evolution. However the KR field has a significant
contribution during early universe, in particular, it affects the beginning of inflation as well
as increases the amount of primordial gravitational radiation and hence enlarges the value of tensor
to scalar ratio in respect to the case when the KR field is absent. In regard to the KR field couplings,
it turns out that in four dimensional higher curvature inflationary model the couplings of the KR
field to other matter fields is given by $1/M_{Pl}$ i.e same as the usual gravity-matter coupling.
However in higher dimensional higher curvature model the KR couplings get an additional suppression
over $1/M_{Pl}$ and thus gives a better explanation of why the present universe carries practically
no footprint of the Kalb-Ramond field in comparison to the 4D higher curvature model. The higher
curvature term in 5D action acts as a suitable stabilizing agent in the dynamical stabilization
mechanism of the extra dimensional modulus field from the perspective of effective on-brane theory.
Based on the evolution of KR field, one intriguing question can be - sitting in present day universe,
how do we confirm the existence of the Kalb-Ramond field which has considerably low energy density
in our present universe but has a significant impact during early universe ? We try to answer this
question by the phenomena "cosmological quantum entanglement" which indeed carries the information
of early universe.

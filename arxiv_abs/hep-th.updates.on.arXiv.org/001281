Orientability is an important topological property of spacetime manifolds. It is generally assumed
that a test for spatial orientability requires a journey across the whole 3-space to check for orientation-reversing
paths. Since such a global expedition is not feasible, theoretical arguments that combine universality
of physical experiments with local arrow of time, CP violation and CPT invariance are offered to
support the choosing of time- and space-orientable spacetime manifolds. We show that it is possible
to access spatial orientability of Minkowski spacetime through local physical effects involving
quantum electromagnetic fluctuations. To this end, we study the motions of a charged particle and
an electric dipole under these fluctuations in Minkowski spacetime with orientable and non-orientable
spatial topologies. We derive expressions for an orientability indicator for both point-like
particles in two spatially flat topologies. For the particle, we show that it is possible to distinguish
the orientable from the non-orientable topology by contrasting the evolution of the indicators.
This shows that it is possible to access orientability through electromagnetic quantum fluctuations.The
answer to the question on how to locally probe the orientability of Minkowski 3-space intrinsically
arises in the study of the dipole's motions. We find that a characteristic inversion pattern exhibited
by the dipole indicator curves is a signature of non-orientability. This result makes it clear that
it is possible to locally unveil spatial non-orientability by the inversion pattern of orientability
indicator curves of an electric dipole under electromagnetic fluctuations. Our findings open
the way to a conceivable experiment involving quantum electromagnetic fluctuations to locally
probe the spatial orientability on the microscopic scale of Minkowski spacetime.

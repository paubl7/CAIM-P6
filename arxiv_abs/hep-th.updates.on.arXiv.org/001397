Despite their consequential applications, metastable states of antibranes in warped throats
are not yet fully understood. In this thesis, we provide new information on various aspects of these
metastable antibranes through applications of the blackfold effective theory for higher-dimensional
black holes. As concrete examples, we study the conjectured metastable state of polarised anti-D3
branes at the tip of the Klebanov-Strassler (KS) throat in type IIB supergravity and the analogous
state of polarised anti-M2 branes at the tip of the Cvetic-Gibbons-Lu-Pope (CGLP) throat in eleven-dimensional
supergravity. For anti-D3 branes in KS throat, we provide novel evidence for the existence of the
metastable state exactly where no-go theorems are lifted. In the extremal limit, we recover directly
in supergravity the metastable states originally discovered by Kachru, Pearson, and Verlinde
(KPV). Away from extremality, we uncover a metastable wrapped black NS5 state. We observe that such
metastability is lost when the wrapped NS5 is heated sufficiently that its horizon geometry resembles
that of a black anti-D3. We study the classical stability of the KPV state under generic long-wavelength
deformations. We observe that, with regards to considered perturbations and regime of parameters,
the state is classically stable. A study of anti-M2 branes in CGLP throat reveals many similarities
to that of the anti-D3 branes. We recover directly in supergravity the Klebanov-Pufu (KP) state
at extremality, and our finite temperature results fit suggestively well with known, complementary
no-go theorems. However, we discover an unexpected, exotic pattern of thermal transitions of the
KP state different from that of the KPV. This thesis contains also a pedagogical introduction to
the blackfold formalism, focusing on aspects immediately relevant to applications to metastable
antibranes.

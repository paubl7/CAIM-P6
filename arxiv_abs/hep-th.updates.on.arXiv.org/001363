In a recent report, Carballo-Rubio [1] utilizes the semi-classical theory of gravity to obtain
a generalized Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff (TOV) equation. This model has a new coupling constant
$l_p$ implying two different modified TOV equation forms characterized by the sign of $p'$. The
negative branch reduces to the ordinary GR-TOV in the limit of $l_p\to0$, while the positive one
does not. In the positive branch, Carballo-Rubio was able to find the exact solutions using the constant-$\lambda$
trick. In this work, we investigate whether this theory's negative branch can also provide a different
feature of the ultra-compact object compared to those obtained from the GR-TOV equation. We study
ultra-compact objects with an isotropically ideal fluid matter where we use a simple but physically
motivated equation of state $\rho=p/w+\rho_0$ with $w$=1 and $w$=1/3. In general, we obtain that
the range of $l_p$ is very restricted and must not be equal to $r_c$. Here $r_c$ is the starting point
of integration located at the center of the star. While $l_p$ should be set to be much larger than Planck
length $L_\text{Pl}$. Consequently, the mass-radius curves for the various value of $l_p$ for
both $w$ cases are still indistinguishable from the standard GR-TOV results. Hence from the negative
branch of $p'(r)$, the additional free parameter $l_p$ does not provide a significant effect compared
to the standard GR-TOV equation results, even though $l_p$ is not in the limit of $l_p\to0$ anymore.
Therefore, similar to the conclusion in Ref. [3] with GR theory that the ultra-compact objects from
negative branch of semi-classical gravity with a linear equation of state are unable to generate
demanding gravitational echoes.

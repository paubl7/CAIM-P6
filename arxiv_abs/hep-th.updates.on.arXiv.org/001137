A quantum system with a black hole accommodates two widely different, though physically equivalent,
descriptions. In one description, based on global spacetime of general relativity, the existence
of the interior region is manifest, while understanding unitarity requires nonperturbative quantum
gravity effects such as Euclidean wormholes. The other description adopts a manifestly unitary,
or holographic, description, in which the interior emerges effectively as a collective phenomenon
of fundamental degrees of freedom. In this paper we study the latter approach, which we refer to as
the unitary gauge construction. In this picture, the formation of a black hole is signaled by the
emergence of a surface (stretched horizon) possessing special dynamical properties: quantum
chaos, fast scrambling, and low energy universality. These properties allow for constructing
interior operators, as we do explicitly, without relying on details of microscopic physics. A key
role is played by certain coarse modes in the zone region (hard modes), which determine the degrees
of freedom relevant for the emergence of the interior. We study how the interior operators can or
cannot be extended in the space of microstates and analyze irreducible errors associated with such
extension. This reveals an intrinsic ambiguity of semiclassical theory formulated with a finite
number of degrees of freedom. We provide an explicit prescription of calculating interior correlators
in the effective theory, which describes only a finite region of spacetime. We study the issue of
state dependence of interior operators in detail and discuss a connection of the resulting picture
with the quantum error correction interpretation of holography.

We propose a new cosmological framework in which the strength of the gravitational force acted on
dark matter at late time can be weaker than that on the standard matter fields without introducing
extra gravitational degrees of freedom. The framework integrates dark matter into a type-II minimally
modified gravity that was recently proposed as a dark energy mimicker. The idea that makes such a
framework possible consists of coupling a dark matter Lagrangian and a cosmological constant to
the metric in a canonically transformed frame of general relativity (GR). On imposing a gauge fixing
constraint, which explicitly breaks the temporal diffeomorphism invariance, we keep the number
of gravitational degrees of freedom to be two, as in GR. We then make the inverse canonical transformation
to bring the theory back to the original frame, where one can add the standard matter fields. This
framework contains two free functions of time which specify the generating functional of the above
mentioned canonical transformation and which are then used in order to realize desired time evolutions
of both the Hubble expansion rate $H(z)$ and the effective gravitational constant for dark matter
$G_{\rm eff}(z)$. The aim of this paper is therefore to provide a new framework to address the two
puzzles present in today's cosmology, i.e. the $H_0$ tension and the $S_8$ tension, simultaneously.
When the dark matter is cold in this framework, we dub the corresponding cosmological model the V
Canonical Cold Dark Matter (VCCDM), as the cosmological constant $\Lambda$ in the standard $\Lambda$CDM
is replaced by a function $V(\phi)$ of an auxiliary field $\phi$ and the CDM is minimally coupled
to the metric in a canonically transformed frame.

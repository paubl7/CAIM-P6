All the laws of physics are time-reversible. Time arrow emerges only when ensembles of classical
particles are treated probabilistically, outside of physics laws, and the entropy and the second
law of thermodynamics are introduced. In quantum physics, no mechanism for a time arrow has been
proposed despite its intrinsic probabilistic nature. In consequence, one cannot explain why an
electron in an excited state will "spontaneously" transition into a ground state as a photon is created
and emitted, instead of continuing in its reversible unitary evolution. To address such phenomena,
we introduce an entropy for quantum physics, which will conduce to the emergence of a time arrow.
The entropy is a measure of randomness over the degrees of freedom of a quantum state. It is dimensionless;
it is a relativistic scalar, it is invariant under coordinate transformation of position and momentum
that maintain conjugate properties and under CPT transformations; and its minimum is positive
due to the uncertainty principle. To excogitate why some quantum physical processes cannot take
place even though they obey conservation laws, we partition the set of all evolutions of an initial
state into four blocks, based on whether the entropy is (i) increasing but not a constant, (ii) decreasing
but not a constant, (iii) a constant, (iv) oscillating. We propose a law that in quantum physics entropy
(weakly) increases over time. Thus, evolutions in the set (ii) are disallowed, and evolutions in
set (iv) are barred from completing an oscillation period by instantaneously transitioning to
a new state. This law for quantum physics limits physical scenarios beyond conservation laws, providing
causality reasoning by defining a time arrow.

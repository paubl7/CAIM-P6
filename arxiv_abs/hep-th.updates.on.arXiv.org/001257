We present a novel expression for an integrated correlation function of four superconformal primaries
in $SU(N)$ $\mathcal{N}=4$ SYM. This integrated correlator, which is based on supersymmetric
localisation, has been the subject of several recent developments. The correlator is re-expressed
as a sum over a two dimensional lattice that is valid for all $N$ and all values of the complex Yang-Mills
coupling $\tau$. In this form it is manifestly invariant under $SL(2,\mathbb{Z})$ Montonen-Olive
duality. Furthermore, it satisfies a remarkable Laplace-difference equation that relates the
$SU(N)$ to the $SU(N+1)$ and $SU(N-1)$ correlators. For any fixed value of $N$ the correlator is
an infinite series of non-holomorphic Eisenstein series, $E(s;\tau,\bar\tau)$ with $s\in \mathbb{Z}$,
and rational coefficients. The perturbative expansion of the integrated correlator is asymptotic
and the $n$-loop coefficient is a rational multiple of $\zeta(2n+1)$. The $n=1$ and $n=2$ terms
agree precisely with results determined directly by integrating the expressions in one- and two-loop
perturbative SYM. Likewise, the charge-$k$ instanton contributions have an asymptotic, but Borel
summable, series of perturbative corrections. The large-$N$ expansion of the correlator with
fixed $\tau$ is a series in powers of $N^{1/2-\ell}$ ($\ell\in \mathbb{Z}$) with coefficients
that are rational sums of $E_s$ with $s\in \mathbb{Z}+1/2$. This gives an all orders derivation
of the form of the recently conjectured expansion. We further consider 't Hooft large-$N$ Yang-Mills
theory. The coefficient of each order can be expanded as a convergent series in $\lambda$. For large
$\lambda$ this becomes an asymptotic series with coefficients that are again rational multiples
of odd zeta values. The large-$\lambda$ series is not Borel summable, and its resurgent non-perturbative
completion is $O(\exp(-2\sqrt{\lambda}))$.

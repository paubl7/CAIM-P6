We present the first numerical solutions of the causal, stable relativistic Navier-Stokes equations
as formulated by Bemfica, Disconzi, Noronha, and Kovtun (BDNK). For this initial investigation
we restrict to plane-symmetric configurations of a conformal fluid in Minkowski spacetime. We
consider evolution of three classes of initial data: a smooth (initially) stationary concentration
of energy, a standard shock tube setup, and a smooth shockwave setup. We compare these solutions
to those obtained with the Muller-Israel-Stewart (MIS) formalism, variants of which are the common
tools used to model relativistic, viscous fluids. We find that for the two smooth initial data cases,
simple finite difference methods are adequate to obtain stable, convergent solutions to the BDNK
equations. For low viscosity, the MIS and BDNK evolutions show good agreement. At high viscosity
the solutions begin to differ in regions with large gradients, and there the BDNK solutions can (as
expected) exhibit violation of the weak energy condition. This behavior is transient, and the solutions
evolve toward a hydrodynamic regime in a way reminiscent of an approach to a universal attractor.
For the shockwave problem, we give evidence that if a hydrodynamic frame is chosen so that the maximum
characteristic speed of the BDNK system is the speed of light (or larger), arbitrarily strong shockwaves
are smoothly resolved. Regarding the shock tube problem, it is unclear whether discontinuous initial
data is mathematically well-posed for the BDNK system, even in a weak sense. Nevertheless we attempt
numerical solution, and then need to treat the perfect fluid terms using high-resolution shock-capturing
methods. When such methods can successfully evolve the solution beyond the initial time, subsequent
evolution agrees with corresponding MIS solutions, as well as the perfect fluid solution in the
limit of zero viscosity.

We obtain a type of Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{\i}a (ABG) related black hole solutions with five parameters:
the mass $m$, the charge $q$, and three dimensionless parameters $\alpha$, $\beta$ and $\gamma$
associated with nonlinear electrodynamics. We find that this type of black holes is regular under
the conditions: $\alpha \gamma \geqslant 6$, $\beta \gamma \geqslant 8$, and $\gamma >0$. Here
we focus on the saturated case: $\alpha={6}/{\gamma}$ and $\beta ={8}/{\gamma }$, such that only
three parameters $m$, $q$ and $\gamma$ remain, which leads to a new family of ABG black holes. For
such a family of black holes, we investigate the influence of the charge $q$ and the parameter $\gamma$
on the horizon radius and the Hawking temperature. In addition, we calculate the quasinormal mode
frequencies of massless scalar field perturbations by using the sixth-order WKB approximation
method and the unstable circular null geodesic method in the eikonal limit. On the one hand, our results
show that the increase of the charge $q$ makes the scalar waves decay faster at first and then slowly
except for the case of $\gamma=2$. On the other hand, they show that the increase of the parameter
$\gamma$ makes the scalar waves decay at first sharply and then slowly. In particular, $\gamma=1$
can be regarded as the critical value for the transition from an unstable configuration to a stable
one. Finally, we compute the shadow radius for the new family of ABG black holes. We find that the increase
of the charge $q$ makes the shadow radius decrease monotonically, while the increase of the parameter
$\gamma$ makes the shadow radius increase at first rapidly and then almost remain unchanged, especially
the parameter $\gamma$ has a significant impact on the shadow radius when it is less than one.

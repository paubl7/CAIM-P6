This thesis is devoted to studying strong coupling phenomena (and confinement in particular) in
supersymmetric gauge theories. The central object of investigation is the non-Abelian string
that is responsible for the "instead-of-confinement" phase for monopoles in 4D ${\mathcal N} =
2$ supersymmetric QCD with the U($N$) gauge group and $N_f$ flavors of quark hypermultiplets, $N
\leqslant N_f \leqslant 2 N$. Here it is shown that the non-Abelian strings and confined monopoles
survive when we transition to the ${\mathcal N} = 1$ supersymmetric QCD. To this end we consider a
mass term $\mu$ for the adjoint matter, and in the limit of large $\mu$ the bulk theory flows to ${\mathcal
N} = 1$. We consider this transition both from the bulk point of view and from the world sheet theory,
which is the two-dimensional $\mathbb{CP}(N-1)$ model. Survival of monopoles in the ${\mathcal
N} = 1$ supersymmetric QCD is important for the "instead-of-confinement" phase, and also for the
Seiberg-Witten picture of confinement. Apart from that, we also consider non-Abelian vortex strings
in 4D $\mathcal{N} = 2$ supersymmetric QCD with U$(N=2)$ gauge group and $N_f=4$ flavors of quark
hypermultiplets. It has been recently shown that these vortices behave as critical superstrings.
In particular, the lowest string state appears to be a massless BPS "baryon." Here we show the occurrence
of this stringy baryon using a purely field-theoretic method. Moreover, we explicitly demonstrate
the "instead-of-confinement" phase, when the screened quarks and gauge bosons of weak coupling
are replaced by the confined monopole-antimonopole pairs of strong coupling. English version.

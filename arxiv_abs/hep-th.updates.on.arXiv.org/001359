The 't Hooft model, i.e. the two-dimensional quantum chromodynamics in the limit of infinite number
of colors, is interpolated by an angle parameter $\delta$ between $\delta=0$ for the instant form
dynamics (IFD) and $\delta=\pi/4$ for the light-front dynamics (LFD). With this parameter $\delta$,
we formulate the interpolating mass gap equation which takes into account the non-trivial vacuum
effect on the bare fermion mass to find the dressed fermion mass. Our interpolating mass gap solutions
link the IFD and LFD results with the $\delta$ parameter. We find the interpolation angle independent
characteristic energy function which satisfies the energy-momentum dispersion relation of the
dressed fermion, identifying the renormalized fermion mass function and the wave function renormalization
factor. Using the dressed fermion propagator interpolating between IFD and LFD, we derive the corresponding
quark-antiquark bound-state equation in the interpolating formulation. The mass spectra of mesons
bearing the feature of the Regge trajectories are found independent of the $\delta$-parameter
for the equal mass quark and antiquark bound-states. The Gell-Mann - Oakes - Renner relation for
the pionic ground-state in the zero fermion mass limit is confirmed indicating that the spontaneous
breaking of the chiral symmetry occurs regardless of the quantization for $0 \le \delta \le \pi/4$.
We obtain the corresponding bound-state wave functions and discuss their reference frame dependence.
Applying them for the computation of the so-called quasi parton distribution functions, we note
a possibility of utilizing not only the reference frame dependence but also the interpolation angle
dependence to get an alternative effective approach to the LFD-like results.

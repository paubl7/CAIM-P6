We explore a class of random tensor network models with ``stabilizer'' local tensors which we name
Random Stabilizer Tensor Networks (RSTNs). For RSTNs defined on a two-dimensional square lattice,
we perform extensive numerical studies of entanglement phase transitions between volume-law
and area-law entangled phases of the one-dimensional boundary states. These transitions occur
when either (a) the bond dimension $D$ of the constituent tensors is varied, or (b) the tensor network
is subject to random breaking of bulk bonds, implemented by forced measurements. In the absence
of broken bonds, we find that the RSTN supports a volume-law entangled boundary state with bond dimension
$D\geq3$ where $D$ is a prime number, and an area-law entangled boundary state for $D=2$. Upon breaking
bonds at random in the bulk with probability $p$, there exists a critical measurement rate $p_c$
for each $D\geq 3$ above which the boundary state becomes area-law entangled. To explore the conformal
invariance at these entanglement transitions for different prime $D$, we consider tensor networks
on a finite rectangular geometry with a variety of boundary conditions, and extract universal operator
scaling dimensions via extensive numerical calculations of the entanglement entropy, mutual
information and mutual negativity at their respective critical points. Our results at large $D$
approach known universal data of percolation conformal field theory, while showing clear discrepancies
at smaller $D$, suggesting a distinct entanglement transition universality class for each prime
$D$. We further study universal entanglement properties in the volume-law phase and demonstrate
quantitative agreement with the recently proposed description in terms of a directed polymer in
a random environment.

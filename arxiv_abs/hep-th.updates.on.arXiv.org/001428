The hypersimplex $\Delta_{k+1,n}$ is the image of the positive Grassmannian $Gr^{\geq 0}_{k+1,n}$
under the moment map. It is a polytope of dimension $n-1$ in $\mathbb{R}^n$. Meanwhile, the amplituhedron
$\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}(Z)$ is the projection of the positive Grassmannian $Gr^{\geq 0}_{k,n}$
into $Gr_{k,k+2}$ under a map $\tilde{Z}$ induced by a matrix $Z\in \text{Mat}_{n,k+2}^{>0}$.
Introduced in the context of scattering amplitudes, it is not a polytope, and has dimension $2k$.
Nevertheless, there seem to be remarkable connections between these two objects via T-duality,
as was first noted by Lukowski--Parisi--Williams (LPW). In this paper we use ideas from oriented
matroid theory, total positivity, and the geometry of the hypersimplex and positroid polytopes
to obtain a deeper understanding of the amplituhedron. We show that the inequalities cutting out
positroid polytopes -- images of positroid cells of $Gr^{\geq 0}_{k+1,n}$ under the moment map
-- translate into sign conditions characterizing the T-dual Grasstopes -- images of positroid
cells of $Gr^{\geq 0}_{k,n}$ under $\tilde{Z}$. Moreover, we subdivide the amplituhedron into
chambers, just as the hypersimplex can be subdivided into simplices, with both chambers and simplices
enumerated by the Eulerian numbers. We prove the main conjecture of (LPW): a collection of positroid
polytopes is a triangulation of $\Delta_{k+1, n}$ if and only if the collection of T-dual Grasstopes
is a triangulation of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}(Z)$ for all $Z$. Moreover, we prove Arkani-Hamed--Thomas--Trnka's
conjectural sign-flip characterization of $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}(Z)$, and Lukowski--Parisi--Spradlin--Volovich's
conjectures on $m=2$ cluster adjacency and on generalized triangles (images of $2k$-dimensional
positroid cells which map injectively into $\mathcal{A}_{n,k,2}(Z)$). Finally, we introduce
new cluster structures in the amplituhedron.

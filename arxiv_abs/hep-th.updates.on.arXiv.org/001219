We study a scalar field model in a two dimensional space-time with a generalized $\phi^4_G$ potential
which has four minima, obtaining novel kink solutions with well defined properties although the
potential is non-analytical at the origin. The model contains a control parameter $\delta$ that
breaks the degeneracy of the potential minima, giving rise to two different phases for the system.
The $\delta<0$ phases do not possess solitary wave solutions. At the transition point $\delta=0$
all the potential minima are degenerate and three different kink solutions result. As the transition
to the $\delta>0$ phase takes place, the minima of the potential are no longer degenerate and a unique
kink $\phi_\delta$ solution is produced. Remarkably, this kink is a coherent structure that results
from the merge of three kinks that can be identified with those observed at the transition point.
To support the interpretation of $\phi_\delta$ as a bound state of three kinks, we calculate the
force between the kink-kink pair components of $\phi_\delta$, obtaining an expression that has
both exponentially repulsive and constant attractive contributions that yields an equilibrium
configuration, explaining the formation of the $\phi_\delta$ multi-kink state. We further investigate
kink properties including their stability guaranteed by the positive defined spectrum of small
fluctuations around the kink configurations. The findings of our work together with a semiclassical
WKB quantization, including the one loop mass renormalization, enable computing quantum corrections
to the kink masses. The general results could be relevant to the development of effective theories
for non-equilibrium steady states and for the understanding of the formation of coherent structures.

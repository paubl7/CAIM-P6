We explore a reduced phase space quantization of loop quantum cosmology (LQC) for a spatially flat
FLRW universe filled with reference fields and an inflaton field in a Starobinsky inflationary
potential. We consider three separate cases in which the reference fields are taken to be the Gaussian
dust, the Brown-Kucha\v{r} dust, and massless Klein-Gordon scalar reference fields respectively.
This is a "two-fluid" model in which reference fields act as global clocks providing a physical time
in an inflationary spacetime, and allow bypassing various technical hurdles in conventional quantum
cosmological models. The reduced phase space is obtained in terms of the Dirac observables of the
gravitational as well as the inflaton degrees of freedom. The physical Hamiltonians of the two dust
models take the same form but turn out to be quite different from that of the Klein-Gordon reference
field which reflects an aspect of the multiple choice problem of time. Loop quantization is implemented
using the so-called $\bar \mu$ scheme and the Schr\"{o}dinger equations involving the physical
Hamiltonian operators generating the evolution in the physical time in the dust and massless Klein-Gordon
models are obtained. These turn out to be quantum difference equations with same non-singular structure
as for other models in LQC. We study some phenomenological implications of the quantization using
the effective dynamics resulting from the reduced phase space quantization including the resolution
of the big bang singularity via a quantum bounce, and effects of the different reference fields on
e-foldings in both the pre-inflationary and the slow-roll inflationary phases. We find that different
clocks, even when starting with a small but same energy density, can leave tiny but different imprints
on the inflationary dynamics. (abridged)

The celebrated Green-Schwarz mechanism in heterotic string theory has been suggested to secretly
underly a higher gauge theoretic phenomenon, embodying a higher Bianchi identity for a higher-degree
analog of a curvature form of a higher gauge field. Here we prove that the non-perturbative Horava-Witten
Green-Schwarz mechanism for heterotic line bundles in heterotic M-theory with M5-branes parallel
to MO9-planes on $A_1$-singularities is accurately encoded in the higher gauge theory for higher
gauge group of the equivariant homotopy type of the Z/2-equivariant A-infinity-loop group of twistor
space. In this formulation, the flux forms of the heterotic gauge field, the B-field on the M5-brane,
and of the C-field in the M-theory bulk are all unified into the character image of a single cocycle
in equivariant twistorial Cohomotopy theory; and that cocycle enforces the quantization condition
on all fluxes: the integrality of the gauge flux, the half-shifted integrality of the C-field flux
and the integrality of the dual C-field flux (i.e., of the Page charge in the bulk and of the Hopf-WZ
term on the M5-brane). This result is in line with the Hypothesis H that M-brane charges are quantized
in J-twisted Cohomotopy theory. The mathematical essence of our proof is, first, the construction
of the equivariant twisted non-abelian character map via an equivariant twisted non-abelian de
Rham theorem, which we prove; and, second, the computation of the equivariant relative minimal
model of the Z/2-equivariant Sp(1)-parametrized twistor fibration. We lay out the relevant background
in equivariant rational homotopy theory and explain how this brings about the subtle flux quantization
relations in heterotic M-theory.

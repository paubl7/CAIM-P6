The accretion around the black hole plays a pivotal role in the theoretical analysis of black hole
shadow, and of the black hole observation in particular. In this paper, we mainly study the shadow
and observation characteristics of noncommutative Schwarzschild black holes wrapped by three
accretion models, and then explore the influence of noncommutative parameters on the observation
appearance and spacetime geometry of black holes. When the black hole is surrounded by an optically
and geometrically thin accretion disk, it shows that the direct emissions always dominate the total
observed intensity, while the lensing ring superimposed upon the direct emission produces a thin
ring, which improves the observation intensity of the black hole image. However, the photon rings
makes a negligible contributions to the total observed brightness due to its exponential narrowness,
although the photon ring intersects the thin plane more than three times to pick up larger intensity.
More importantly, when the noncommutative parameters changed, the corresponding regions and
observation intensities of photon ring, lensing ring and direct emission all change correspondingly.
For optical thin spherically symmetric accretion, we consider the static and infalling matters,
respectively. We find that the observation intensity of the two spherical accretion models increase
with the increase of noncommutative parameters. In addition, due to the Doppler effect of the infalling
movement, the shadow image of infalling accretion is darker than that of static accretion. In a word,
the different accretion models and noncommutative parameters will lead to different shadow images
and optical appearances of noncommutative Schwarzschild black holes.

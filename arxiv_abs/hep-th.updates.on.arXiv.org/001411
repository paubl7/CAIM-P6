Despite being the overwhelming majority of events produced in hadron or heavy ion collisions, minimum
bias events do not enjoy a robust first-principles theoretical description as their dynamics are
dominated by low-energy quantum chromodynamics. In this paper, we present a novel expansion scheme
of the cross section for minimum bias events that exploits an ergodic hypothesis for particles in
the events and events in an ensemble of data. We identify power counting rules and symmetries of minimum
bias from which the form of the squared matrix element can be expanded in symmetric polynomials of
the phase space coordinates. This expansion is entirely defined in terms of observable quantities,
in contrast to models of heavy ion collisions that rely on unmeasurable quantities like the number
of nucleons participating in the collision, or tunes of parton shower parameters to describe the
underlying event in proton collisions. The expansion parameter that we identify from our power
counting is the number of detected particles $N$ and as $N\to\infty$ the variance of the squared
matrix element about its mean, constant value on phase space vanishes. With this expansion, we show
that the transverse momentum distribution of particles takes a universal form that only depends
on a single parameter, has a fractional dispersion relation, and agrees with data in its realm of
validity. We show that the constraint of positivity of the squared matrix element requires that
all azimuthal correlations vanish in the $N\to\infty$ limit at fixed center-of-mass energy, as
observed in data. The approach we follow allows for a unified treatment of small and large system
collective behavior, being equally applicable to describe, e.g., elliptic flow in PbPb collisions
and the "ridge" in pp collisions.

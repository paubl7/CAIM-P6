We work out the interplay between lowest-order perturbative computations in the 't Hooft coupling,
$g^2=g^2_{YM} N$, operator mixing, renormalization-group (RG) improved ultraviolet (UV) asymptotics
of leading-order (LO) nonplanar/planar contributions to $2$-point correlators, and nonperturbative
large-$N$ expansion of perturbatively massless QCD-like theories. As concrete examples, we compute
to the lowest perturbative order in $SU(N)$ YM theory the ratios, $r_i$, of LO-nonplanar to planar
contributions to the $2$-point correlators in the orthogonal basis in the coordinate representation
of the gauge-invariant dimension-$8$ scalar operators and all the twist-$2$ operators. We demonstrate
that -- if $\frac{\gamma_0}{\beta_0}$ has no LO-nonplanar contribution, with $\gamma_0$ and
$\beta_0$ the one-loop coefficients of the anomalous-dimension matrix and beta function respectively
-- $r_i$ actually coincides with the corresponding ratio in the large-$N$ expansion of the RG-improved
UV asymptotics of the $2$-point correlators, provided that a certain canonical nonresonant diagonal
renormalization scheme exists for the corresponding operators. Contrary to the aforementioned
scalar operators, for the first $10^3$ twist-$2$ operators we actually verify the above conditions,
and we get the universal value $r_i=-\frac{1}{N^2}$. Hence, nonperturbatively such $r_i$ must
coincide with the UV asymptotics of the ratio of the glueball self-energy loop to the glueball tree
contribution to the $2$-point correlators above. As a consequence, the universality of $r_i$ reflects
the universality of the effective coupling in the nonperturbative large-$N$ YM theory for the twist-$2$
operators in the coordinate representation.

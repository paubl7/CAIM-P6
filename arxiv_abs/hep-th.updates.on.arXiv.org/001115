The quantum field theoretic description of general relativity is a modern approach to gravity where
gravitational force is carried by spin-2 gravitons. In the classical limit of this theory, general
relativity as described by the Einstein field equations is obtained. This limit, where classical
general relativity is derived from quantum field theory is the topic of this thesis. The Schwarzschild-Tangherlini
metric, which describes the gravitational field of an inertial point particle in arbitrary space-time
dimensions, $D$, is analyzed. The metric is related to the three-point vertex function of a massive
scalar interacting with a graviton to all orders in $G_N$, and the one-loop contribution to this
amplitude is computed from which the $G_N^2$ contribution to the metric is derived. To understand
the gauge-dependence of the metric, covariant gauge is used which introduces the parameter, $\xi$,
and the gauge-fixing function $G_\sigma$. In the classical limit, the gauge-fixing function turns
out to be the coordinate condition, $G_\sigma=0$. As gauge-fixing function a novel family of gauges,
which depends on an arbitrary parameter $\alpha$ and includes both harmonic and de Donder gauge,
is used. Feynman rules for the graviton field are derived and important results are the graviton
propagator in covariant gauge and a general formula for the n-graviton vertex in terms of the Einstein
tensor. The Feynman rules are used both in deriving the Schwarzschild-Tangherlini metric from
amplitudes and in the computation of the one-loop correction to the metric. The one-loop correction
to the metric is independent of the covariant gauge parameter, $\xi$, and satisfies the gauge condition
$G_\sigma=0$ where $G_\sigma$ is the family of gauges depending on $\alpha$. In space-time $D=5$
a logarithm appears in position space and this phenomena is analyzed in terms of redundant gauge
freedom.

Classical Hamiltonian systems with balanced loss and gain are considered in this review. A generic
Hamiltonian formulation for systems with space-dependent balanced loss and gain is discussed.
It is shown that the loss-gain terms may be removed completely through appropriate co-ordinate
transformations with its effect manifested in modifying the strength of the velocity-mediated
coupling. The effect of the Lorentz interaction in improving the stability of classical solutions
as well as allowing a possibility of defining the corresponding quantum problem consistently on
the real line, instead of within Stokes wedges, is also discussed. Several exactly solvable models
based on translational and rotational symmetry are discussed which include coupled cubic oscillators,
Landau Hamiltonian etc. The role of PT-symmetry on the existence of periodic solution in systems
with balanced loss and gain is critically analyzed. A few non-PT-symmetric Hamiltonian as well
as non-Hamiltonian systems with balanced loss and gain, which include mechanical as well as extended
system, are shown to admit periodic solutions. An example of Hamiltonian chaos within the framework
of a non-PT-symmetric system of coupled Duffing oscillator with balanced loss-gain and/or positional
non-conservative forces is discussed. It is conjectured that a non-PT-symmetric system with balanced
loss-gain and without any velocity mediated interaction may admit periodic solution if the linear
part of the equations of motion is necessarily PT-symmetric -- the nonlinear interaction may or
may not be PT-symmetric. Further, systems with velocity mediated interaction need not be PT-symmetric
at all in order to admit periodic solutions. Results related to nonlinear Schrodinger and Dirac
equations with balanced loss and gain are mentioned briefly. A class of solvable models of oligomers
with balanced loss and gain is presented.

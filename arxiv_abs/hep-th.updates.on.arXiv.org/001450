This paper systematically treats the evolving quantum state for two-dimensional black holes,
with particular focus on the CGHS model, but also elucidating features generalizing to higher dimensions.
This is done in Schr\"odinger picture(s), to exhibit the dynamic evolution of the state at intermediate
times. After a review of classical solutions, also connecting to descriptions of higher-dimensional
black holes, it overviews the canonical quantum treatment of the full evolution, including gravitational
dynamics. Derived in an approximation to this, following conversion to "perturbation picture,"
is the evolution of the quantum matter on the background geometry. Features of the evolving matter
state are described, based on choice of a time slicing to put the evolution into ADM form. The choices
of slicing as well as coordinates on the slices result in different quantum "pictures" for treating
the evolution. If such a description is based on smooth trans-horizon slices, that avoids explicit
reference to ultra-planckian modes familiar from traditional treatments, and exhibits the Hawking
excitations as emerging from a "quantum atmosphere" with thickness comparable to the inverse temperature.
Detailed study of the state exhibits the entanglement structure between Hawking quanta and the
partner excitations inside the black hole, and the corresponding "missing information." This
explicit description also allows direct study of the evolution and features, e.g. as seen by infalling
observers, of these partner excitations, helping to address various puzzles with them. Explicit
treatment of the evolving state, and its extension to higher dimensions, provides further connections
to information theory and a starting point for study of corrections that can unitarize evolution,
arising from new quantum gravity effects -- whether wormholes or something entirely different.

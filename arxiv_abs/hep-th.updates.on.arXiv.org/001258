We study the radiative process of two entangled two-level atoms uniformly accelerated in a thermal
bath, coupled to a massless scalar field. First, using the positive frequency Wightman function
from the Minkowski modes with a Rindler transformation we provide the transition probabilities
for the transitions from maximally entangled symmetric and anti-symmetric Bell states to the collective
excited state in $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$ dimensions. We observe a possible case of \emph{anti-Unruh-like}
event in these transition probabilities, though the $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$ dimensional results are
not completely equivalent. We infer that thermal bath plays a major role in the occurrence of the
anti-Unruh-like effect, as it is also present in the transition probabilities corresponding to
a single detector in this case. Second, we have considered the Green's functions in terms of the Rindler
modes with the vacuum of Unruh modes for estimating the same. Here the anti-Unruh effect appears
only for the transition from the anti-symmetric state to the collective excited state. It is noticed
that here the $(1+1)$ and $(1+3)$ dimensional results are equivalent, and for a single detector,
we do not observe any anti-Unruh effect. This suggests that the entanglement between the states
of the atoms is the main cause for the observed anti-Unruh effect in this case. In going through the
investigation, we find that the transition probability for a single detector case is symmetric
under the interchange between the thermal bath's temperature and the Unruh temperature for Rindler
mode analysis; whereas this is not the case for Minkowski mode. We further comment on whether this
observation may shed light on the analogy between an accelerated observer and a real thermal bath.
An elaborate investigation for the classifications of our observed anti-Unruh effects is also
thoroughly demonstrated.

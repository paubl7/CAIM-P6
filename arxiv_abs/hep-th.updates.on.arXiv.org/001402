We study the behavior of Donaldson's invariants of 4-manifolds based on the moduli space of anti
self-dual connections (instantons) in the perturbative field theory setting where the underlying
source manifold has boundary. It is well-known that these invariants take values in the instanton
Floer homology groups of the boundary 3-manifold. Gluing formulae for these constructions lead
to a functorial topological field theory description according to a system of axioms developed
by Atiyah, which can be also regarded in the setting of perturbative quantum field theory, as it was
shown by Witten, using a version of supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory, known today as Donaldson-Witten
theory. One can actually formulate an AKSZ model which recovers this theory for a certain gauge-fixing.
We consider these constructions in a perturbative quantum gauge formalism for manifolds with boundary
that is compatible with cutting and gluing, called the BV-BFV formalism, which was recently developed
by Cattaneo, Mnev and Reshetikhin. We prove that this theory satisfies a modified Quantum Master
Equation and extend the result to a global picture when perturbing around constant background fields.
Additionally, we relate these constructions to Nekrasov's partition function by treating an equivariant
version of Donaldson-Witten theory in the BV formalism. Moreover, we discuss the extension, as
well as the relation, to higher gauge theory and enumerative geometry methods, such as Gromov-Witten
and Donaldson-Thomas theory and recall their correspondence conjecture for general Calabi-Yau
3-folds. In particular, we discuss the corresponding (relative) partition functions, defined
as the generating function for the given invariants, and gluing phenomena.

We investigate the effects of a brane and magnetic-flux-carrying cosmic string on the vacuum expectation
value (VEV) of the current density for a charged fermionic field in the background geometry of 4+1
dimensional anti-de Sitter (AdS) spacetime. The brane is parallel to the AdS boundary and the cosmic
string is orthogonal to the brane. Two types of boundary conditions are considered on the brane that
include the MIT bag boundary condition and the boundary conditions in Z2-symmetric braneworld
models. The brane divides the space into two regions with different properties of the vacuum state.
The only nonzero component of the current density is along the azimuthal direction and in both the
regions the corresponding VEV is decomposed into the brane-free and brane-induced contributions.
The latter vanishes on the string and near the string the total current is dominated by the brane-free
part. At large distances from the string and in the region between the brane and AdS horizon the decay
of the brane-induced current density, as a function of the proper distance, is power-law for both
massless and massive fields. For a massive field this behavior is essentially different from that
in the Minkowski bulk. In the region between the brane and AdS boundary the large-distance decay
of the current density is exponential. Depending on the boundary condition on the brane, the brane-induced
contribution is dominant or subdominant in the total current density at large distances from the
string. By using the results for fields realizing two inequivalent irreducible representations
of the Clifford algebra, the vacuum current density is investigated in C- and P-symmetric fermionic
models. Applications are given for a cosmic string in the Randall-Sundrum-type braneworld model
with a single brane.

In this paper, we apply the Regge-Wheeler formalism in our study of axial and polar gravitational
waves in the Kantowski-Sachs universe. The background field equations and the linearised perturbation
equations for axial and polar modes are derived in presence of matter. To find the analytical solutions,
we analyze the propagation of waves in vacuum spacetime. The background field equations in absence
of matter are first solved by assuming that the expansion scalar $ \Theta $ to be proportional to the
shear scalar $ \sigma $ (so that the metric coefficients are given by the relation $ a = b^n $, where
$ n $ is an arbitrary constant). Using the method of separation of variables, the axial perturbation
parameter $ h_0(t, r) $ is obtained from its wave equation. The other perturbation $ h_1(t, r) $ is
then determined from $ h_0(t, r) $. %the equation connecting the two. We observe that the anisotropy
of the background spacetime is responsible for the damping of the axial waves propagating through
it. On the other hand, the polar perturbation equations are much more involved compared to their
FLRW counterparts, as well as to the axial perturbations in the Kantowski-Sachs background. The
polar equations contain complicated couplings among the perturbation variables. In both the axial
and polar cases, the radial and temporal solutions for the perturbations separate out as a product.
The perturbation equations in presence of matter show that the axial waves can cause perturbations
only in the azimuthal velocity of the fluid without deforming the matter field. But the polar waves
must perturb the energy density, the pressure and also the non-azimuthal components of the fluid
velocity. The propagation of axial and polar gravitational waves in Kantowski-Sachs and Bianchi
I spacetimes is found to be more or less similar in nature.

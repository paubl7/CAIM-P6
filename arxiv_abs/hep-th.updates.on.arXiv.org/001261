Higher order topological insulators (HOTIs) are a novel form of insulating quantum matter, which
are characterized by having gapped boundaries that are separated by gapless corner or hinge states.
Recently, it has been proposed that the essential features of a large class of HOTIs are captured
by topological multipolar response theories. In this work, we show that these multipolar responses
can be realized in interacting lattice models, which conserve both charge and dipole. In this work
we study several models in both the strongly interacting and mean-field limits. In $2$D we consider
a ring-exchange model which exhibits a quadrupole response, and can be tuned to a $C_4$ symmetric
higher order topological phase with half-integer quadrupole moment, as well as half-integer corner
charges. We then extend this model to develop an analytic description of adiabatic dipole pumping
in an interacting lattice model. The quadrupole moment changes during this pumping process, and
if the process is periodic, we show the total change in the quadrupole moment is quantized as an integer.
We also consider two interacting $3$D lattice models with chiral hinge modes. We show that the chiral
hinge modes are heralds of a recently proposed "dipolar Chern-Simons" response, which is related
to the quadrupole response by dimensional reduction. Interestingly, we find that in the mean field
limit, both the $2$D and $3$D interacting models we consider here are equivalent to known models
of non-interacting HOTIs (or boundary obstructed versions). The self-consistent mean-field
theory treatment provides insight into the connection between free-fermion (mean-field) theories
having vanishing polarization and interacting models where dipole moments are microscopically
conserved.

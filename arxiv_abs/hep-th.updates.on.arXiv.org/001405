Eigenvalue problems arise in many areas of physics from solving a classical electromagnetic problem
to calculating quantum bound states of the hydrogen atom. Eigenvalue problems are traditionally
defined for linear problems and in particular for linear differential equations such as time-independent
Schr\"odinger equations. Eigenfunctions of such problems exhibit several common features independent
of the form of the underlying equations. As discussed in [J. Phys. A47, 235204 (2014)], separatrices
of nonlinear differential equations share some of these features, and in this sense, they can be
considered as eigenfunctions of nonlinear differential equations, and the initial conditions
that give rise to the separatrices play the role of eigenvalues. We introduce a first-order nonlinear
eigenvalue problem that involves a general class of functions and obtain the large-eigenvalue
limit by reducing the problem to a random walk problem on a half-line. The introduced general class
of functions covers many special functions such as the Bessel and Airy functions, which are themselves
solutions of second-order differential equations. For instance, in the special case involving
the Bessel functions of the first kind, i.e. for $y'(x)=J_\nu(xy)$, we show that the eigenvalues
asymptotically grow as $2^{41/42} n^{1/4}$. We also introduce and discuss nonlinear eigenvalue
problems that involve the reciprocal gamma and the Riemann zeta functions, which are not solutions
to any simple differential equations. With the reciprocal gamma function, i.e. for $y'(x)=1/\Gamma(-xy)$,
we show that the eigenvalues grow factorially fast as $\sqrt{(1-2n)/\Gamma(r_{2n-1})}$, where
$r_{2n-1}$ is the $(2n-1)$th root of the digamma function.

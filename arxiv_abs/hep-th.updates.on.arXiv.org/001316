[Abridged] Recently, the production of primordial black holes (PBHs) and secondary gravitational
waves (GWs) due to enhanced scalar power on small scales have garnered considerable attention in
the literature. Often, the mechanism considered to arrive at such enhanced power involves a modification
of the standard slow roll inflationary dynamics, achieved with the aid of fine-tuned potentials.
In this work, we investigate another well known method to generate features in the power spectrum
wherein the initial state of the perturbations is assumed to be squeezed states. This approach is
technically straightforward to implement since the Bogoliubov coefficients characterizing
the squeezed initial states, can be immediately determined from the desired form of the power spectrum.
It is known that, for squeezed initial states, the scalar bispectrum is strongly scale dependent
and the consistency condition governing the scalar bispectrum in the squeezed limit is violated.
In fact, the non-Gaussianity parameter $f_{_{\rm NL}}$ characterizing the scalar bispectrum
proves to be inversely proportional to the squeezed mode and this dependence enhances its amplitude
at large wave numbers making it highly sensitive to even a small deviation from the standard Bunch-Davies
vacuum. These aspects can possibly aid in leading to enhanced formation of PBHs and generation of
secondary GWs. However, we find that: (i) the desired form of the squeezed initial states may be challenging
to achieve from a dynamical mechanism, and (ii) the backreaction due to the excited states severely
limits the extent of deviation from the Bunch-Davies vacuum at large wave numbers. We argue that,
unless the issue of backreaction is circumvented, squeezed initial states cannot lead to a substantial
increase in power on small scales that is required for enhanced formation of PBHs and generation
of secondary GWs.

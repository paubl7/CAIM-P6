This thesis presents a framework in which to explore kinematical symmetries beyond the standard
Lorentzian case. This framework consists of an algebraic classification, a geometric classification,
and a derivation of the geometric properties required to define physical theories on the classified
spacetime geometries. The work completed in substantiating this framework for kinematical, super-kinematical,
and super-Bargmann symmetries constitutes the body of this thesis. To this end, the classification
of kinematical Lie algebras in spatial dimension $D = 3$, as presented in [3, 4], is reviewed; as is
the classification of spatially-isotropic homogeneous spacetimes of [5]. The derivation of geometric
properties such as the non-compactness of boosts, soldering forms and vielbeins, and the space
of invariant affine connections is then presented. We move on to classify the $\mathcal{N}=1$ kinematical
Lie superalgebras in three spatial dimensions, finding 43 isomorphism classes of Lie superalgebras.
Once these algebras are determined, we classify the corresponding simply-connected homogeneous
(4|4)-dimensional superspaces and show how the resulting 27 homogeneous superspaces may be related
to one another via geometric limits. Finally, we turn our attention to generalised Bargmann superalgebras.
In the present work, these will be the $\mathcal{N}=1$ and $\mathcal{N}=2$ super-extensions of
the Bargmann and Newton-Hooke algebras, as well as the centrally-extended static kinematical
Lie algebra, of which the former three all arise as deformations. Focussing solely on three spatial
dimensions, we find $9$ isomorphism classes in the $\mathcal{N}=1$ case, and we identify $22$ branches
of superalgebras in the $\mathcal{N}=2$ case.

The holomorphic Coulomb gas formalism is a set of rules for computing minimal model observables
using free field techniques. We attempt to derive and clarify these rules using standard techniques
of QFT. We begin with a careful examination of the timelike linear dilaton. Although the background
charge $Q$ breaks the scalar field's continuous shift symmetry, the exponential of the action is
invariant under a discrete shift because $Q$ is imaginary. Gauging this symmetry makes the dilaton
compact and introduces winding modes into the spectrum. One of these winding operators corresponds
to the BRST current first introduced by Felder. The cohomology of this BRST charge isolates the irreducible
representations of the Virasoro algebra within the linear dilaton Fock space, and the supertrace
in the BRST complex reproduces the minimal model partition function. The model at the radius $R=\sqrt{pp'}$
has two marginal operators corresponding to the Dotsenko-Fateev screening charges. Deforming
by them, we obtain a model that might be called a "BRST quotiented compact timelike Liouville theory."
The Hamiltonian of the zero-mode quantum mechanics is not Hermitian, but it is $PT$-symmetric and
exactly solvable. Its eigenfunctions have support on an infinite number of plane waves, suggesting
an infinite reduction in the number of independent states in the full QFT. Applying conformal perturbation
theory to the exponential interactions reproduces the Coulomb gas calculations of minimal model
correlators. In contrast to spacelike Liouville, these resonance correlators are finite because
the zero mode is compact. We comment on subtleties regarding the reflection operator identification,
as well as naive violations of truncation in correlators with multiple reflection operators inserted.
This work is part of an attempt to understand the relationship between JT gravity and the $(2,p)$
minimal string.

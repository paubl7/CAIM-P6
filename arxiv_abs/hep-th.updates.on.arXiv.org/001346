We convincingly argue that the true dynamical and gauge structures of the QCD ground state are much
more complicated than its Lagrangian exact gauge symmetry supposes to be. The dynamical source
of these complications has been identified with the tadpole/seagull term, which renormalized
version called, {\sl the mass gap}. It is explicitly present in the full gluon self-energy. The true
dynamical role of the mass gap was hidden in the QCD ground state. To disclose it the splintering between
the transverse conditions for the full gluon self-energy and its subtracted counterpart has been
derived. We have established the equation of motion for the full gluon propagator on account of the
mass gap. It allows to fix the dynamical and gauge structures of the full gluon propagator with a newly-derived
generalized gauge. It is uniquely given as a function of the gluon momentum. All this makes it possible
to present novel non-perturbative analytical approach to QCD, which we call the mass gap approach.
It extends the mass gap concept to be accounted for the QCD ground state as well. We have found the general
non-perturbative solution for the full gluon propagator with exactly defined finite gluon pole
mass, and it is different from the excitations with the effective gluon masses. Despite the exact
gauge symmetry is broken in the ground state, the renormalizability of the theory is not affected
due to the important role of the Slavnov-Taylor identity in the renormalization beyond the perturbation
theory. For this the non-perturbative multiplicative renormalization program for the full massive
gluon propagator has been formulated. Our approach does not allow the massive gluons to be the mass-shell
objects, and thus prevents them to appear as physical states at large distances (confinement of
massive gluons).

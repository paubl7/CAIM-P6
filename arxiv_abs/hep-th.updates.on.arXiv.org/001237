Oscillons are spatially localized structures that appear in scalar field theories and exhibit
extremely long life-times. We go beyond single-field analyses and study oscillons comprised of
multiple interacting fields, each having an identical potential with quadratic, quartic and sextic
terms. We consider quartic interaction terms of either attractive or repulsive nature. In the two-field
case, we construct semi-analytical oscillon profiles for different values of the potential parameters
and coupling strength using the two-timing small-amplitude formalism. We show that the interaction
sign, attractive or repulsive, leads to different oscillon solutions, albeit with similar characteristics,
like the emergence of "flat-top" shapes. In the case of attractive interactions, the oscillons
can reach higher values of the energy density and smaller values of the width. For repulsive interactions
we identify a threshold for the coupling strength, above which oscillons do not exist within the
two-timing small-amplitude framework. We extend the Vakhitov-Kolokolov (V-K) stability criterion,
which has been used to study single-field oscillons, and show that the symmetry of the potential
leads to similar equations as in the single-field case, albeit with modified terms. We explore the
basin of attraction of stable oscillon solutions numerically to test the validity of the V-K criterion
and show that, depending on the initial perturbation size, unstable oscillons can either completely
disperse or relax to the closest stable configuration. Similarly to the V-K criterion, the decay
rate and lifetime of two-field oscillons are found to be qualitatively and quantitatively similar
to their single-field counterparts. Finally, we generalize our analysis to multi-field oscillons
and show that the governing equations for their shape and stability can be mapped to the ones arising
in the two-field case.

In arXiv:1911.08172 we have studied the single-particle free energy of a class of Little String
Theories of A-type, which are engineered by $N$ parallel M5-branes on a circle. To leading instanton
order (from the perspective of the low energy $U(N)$ gauge theory) and partially also to higher order,
a decomposition was observed, which resembles a Feynman diagrammatic expansion: external states
are given by expansion coefficients of the $N=1$ BPS free energy and a quasi-Jacobi form that governs
the BPS-counting of an M5-brane coupling to two M2-branes. The effective coupling functions were
written as infinite series and similarities to modular graph functions were remarked. In the current
work we continue and extend this study: Working with the full non-perturbative BPS free energy,
we analyse in detail the cases $N=2,3$ and $4$. We argue that in these cases to leading instanton order
all coupling functions can be written as a simple combination of two-point functions of a single
free scalar field on the torus. We provide closed form expressions, which we conjecture to hold for
generic $N$. To higher instanton order, we observe that a decomposition of the free energy in terms
of higher point functions with the same external states is still possible but a priori not unique.
We nevertheless provide evidence that tentative coupling functions are still combinations of
scalar Greens functions, which are decorated with derivatives or multiplied with holomorphic
Eisenstein series. We interpret these decorations as corrections of the leading order effective
couplings and in particular link the latter to dihedral graph functions with bivalent vertices,
which suggests an interpretation in terms of disconnected graphs.

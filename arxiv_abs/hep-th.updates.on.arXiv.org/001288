Violations of Lorentz (and specifically boost) invariance can make gravity renormalizable in
the ultraviolet, as initially noted by Ho\v{r}ava, but are increasingly constrained in the infrared.
At low energies, Ho\v{r}ava gravity is characterized by three dimensionless couplings, $\alpha$,
$\beta$ and $\lambda$, which vanish in the general relativistic limit. Solar system and gravitational
wave experiments bound two of these couplings ($\alpha$ and $\beta$) to tiny values, but the third
remains relatively unconstrained ($0\leq\lambda\lesssim 0.01-0.1$). Moreover, demanding
that (slowly moving) black-hole solutions are regular away from the central singularity requires
$\alpha$ and $\beta$ to vanish {\it exactly}. Although a canonical constraint analysis shows that
the class of khronometric theories resulting from these constraints ($\alpha=\beta=0$ and $\lambda\neq0$)
cannot be equivalent to General Relativity, even in vacuum, previous calculations of the dynamics
of the solar system, binary pulsars and gravitational-wave generation show perfect agreement
with General Relativity. Here, we analyze spherical collapse and compute black-hole quasinormal
modes, and find again that they behave {\it exactly} as in General Relativity, as far as {\it observational}
predictions are concerned. Nevertheless, we find that spherical collapse leads to the formation
of a regular {\it universal} horizon, i.e. a causal boundary for signals of arbitrary propagation
speeds, inside the usual event horizon for matter and tensor gravitons. Our analysis also confirms
that the additional scalar degree of freedom present alongside the spin-2 graviton of General Relativity
remains strongly coupled at low energies, even on curved backgrounds. These puzzling results suggest
that any further bounds on Ho\v{r}ava gravity will probably come from cosmology.

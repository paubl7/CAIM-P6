Equilibrium thermodynamic properties of charged relativistic fluids can be captured by a static
generating functional, which is a functional of the background sources. The stress-energy tensor
of the fluid, for instance, gets sourced by the background metric, and charge currents are sourced
by background gauge fields. In the hydrodynamic regime, where one probes the system at low energy
and long length scales, the generating functional admits an expansion in derivatives, capturing
the equilibrium response of the fluid to the presence of external sources through various susceptibilities
that appear as coefficients in this derivative expansion. For a relativistic fluid in 3+1 dimensions
with a $U(1)$ charge, there are nine independent thermodynamic susceptibilities at the second
order in the derivative expansion. Of these, seven are time-reversal $\mathbb{T}$ invariant and
admit Kubo formulas in terms of equilibrium two-point functions of the conserved currents. Making
use of the gauge/gravity duality along with these Kubo formulas, we numerically compute all seven
$\mathbb{T}$-invariant second order susceptibilities for the charged $\mathcal{N} = 4$ supersymmetric
$SU(N_c)$ Yang-Mills plasma in the large $N_c$ limit and at strong 't-Hooft coupling $\lambda$
as a function of the parameter $\mu/T$, where $\mu$ is the chemical potential and $T$ is the temperature
of the plasma. The dual gravitational description for the charged plasma in thermal equilibrium
is provided by the asymptotically AdS$_5$ Reissner-Nordstr\"{o}m black brane geometry. Making
use of the Kubo formulas, the susceptibilities are extracted by studying perturbations to the bulk
geometry as well as to the bulk gauge field. We also present an estimate of the second order transport
coefficient $\kappa$, which determines the response of the fluid to the presence of background
curvature, for QCD, using our results.

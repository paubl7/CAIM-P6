Unlike scalar and gauge field theories in four dimensions, gravity is not perturbatively renormalizable
and as a result perturbation theory is badly divergent. Often the method of choice for investigating
nonperturbative effects has been the lattice formulation, and in the case of gravity the Regge-Wheeler
lattice path integral lends itself well for that purpose. Nevertheless, lattice methods ultimately
rely on extensive numerical calculations, leaving a desire for alternate calculations that can
be done analytically. In this work we outline the Hartree-Fock approximation to quantum gravity,
along lines which are analogous to what is done for scalar fields and gauge theories. The starting
point is Dyson's equations, a closed set of integral equations which relate various physical amplitudes
involving graviton propagators, vertex functions and proper self-energies. Such equations are
in general difficult to solve, and as a result not very useful in practice, but nevertheless provide
a basis for subsequent approximations. This is where the Hartree-Fock approximation comes in,
whereby lowest order diagrams get partially dressed by the use of fully interacting Green's function
and self-energies, which then lead to a set of self-consistent integral equations. Specifically,
for quantum gravity one finds a nontrivial ultraviolet fixed point in Newton's constant G for spacetime
dimensions greater than two, and nontrivial scaling dimensions between d=2 and d=4, above which
one obtains Gaussian exponents. In addition, the Hartree-Fock approximation gives an explicit
analytic expression for the renormalization group running of Newton's constant, suggesting gravitational
antiscreening with Newton's G slowly increasing on cosmological scales.

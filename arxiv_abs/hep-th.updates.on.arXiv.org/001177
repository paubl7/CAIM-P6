We delineate the quark-hadron continuity by constructing QCD equations of state for neutron star
dynamics, covering the wide range of charge chemical potential ($\mu_Q$) and temperatures ($T$).
Based on the nuclear-2SC continuity scenario, we match equations of state for nuclear and two-flavor
color-superconducting (2SC) quark matter, where the matching baryon density is $n_B\simeq 1.5n_0$
($n_0\simeq 0.16\, {\rm fm^{-3}}$: nuclear saturation density). The effective vector and diquark
couplings in a quark matter model evolve as functions of ($n_B, \mu_Q, T$), whose low density values
are constrained by the nuclear matter properties and neutron star radii, while the high density
behavior by the two-solar mass ($2M_\odot$) constraint. In this coupling constant interpolation,
at low temperature we found a tension in nuclear and 2SC entropies, as baryon and quark Fermi velocities
differ. This mismatch is closed by the temperature dependence of the evolving couplings but whose
behaviors seem to require the physics beyond conventional 2SC descriptions. Hence we call the 2SC
matter with such extra contributions "2SCX", where X is perhaps a composite object not manifestly
computed in our model. At high density, the strangeness appears around $n_B\simeq 2$-$4n_0$ and
the 2SCX transforms into "CFLX" (CFL:color-flavor-locked) which is more sensitive to $(\mu_Q,T)$
than in the conventional CFL. Including charged leptons and neutrinos, we study the composition
of matter for lepton fractions relevant for protoneutron stars and neutron star mergers. The abundance
of neutrinos and thermal effects reduce the strangeness fraction and stiffen equations of state.
For a neutrino trapped neutron star at $T\simeq 30 $ MeV with a lepton fraction $Y_L\simeq 0.05$,
the mass is larger than its cold static counterpart by $\sim 0.1M_\odot$.

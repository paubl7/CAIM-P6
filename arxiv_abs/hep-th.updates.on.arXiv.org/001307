This article describes the regularization of the generally relativistic gauge field representation
of gravity on a piecewise linear lattice. It is a part of the program concerning the classical relativistic
theory of fundamental interactions, represented by minimally coupled gauge vector field densities
and half-densities. The correspondence between the local Darboux coordinates on phase space and
the local structure of the links of the lattice, embedded in the spatial manifold, is demonstrated.
Thus, the canonical coordinates are replaceable by links-related quantities. This idea and the
significant part of formalism are directly based on the model of canonical loop quantum gravity
(CLQG). The first stage of this program is formulated regarding the gauge field, which dynamics
is independent of other fundamental fields, but contributes to their dynamics. This gauge field,
which determines systems equivalence in the actions defining all fundamental interactions, represents
Einsteinian gravity. The related links-defined quantities depend on holonomies of gravitational
connections and fluxes of densitized dreibeins. This article demonstrates how to determine these
quantities, which lead to a nonpertubative formalism that preserves the general postulate of relativity.
From this perspective, the formalism presented in this article is analogous to the Ashtekar-Barbero-Holst
formulation on which CLQG is based. However, in this project, it is additionally required that the
fields' coordinates are quantizable in the standard canonical procedure for a gauge theory and
that any approximation in the construction of the model is at least as precisely demonstrated as
the gauge invariance. These requirements lead to new relations between holonomies and connections,
and the representation of the densitized deibein determinant that is more precise than the volume
representation in CLQG.

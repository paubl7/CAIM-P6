We investigate the differential geometry and topology of globally hyperbolic four-manifolds
$(M,g)$ admitting a parallel real spinor $\varepsilon$. Using the theory of parabolic pairs recently
introduced in arXiv:1911.08658 , we first formulate the parallelicity condition of $\varepsilon$
on $M$ as a system of partial differential equations, the parallel spinor flow equations, for a family
of polyforms on any given Cauchy surface $\Sigma \hookrightarrow M$. Existence of a parallel spinor
on $(M,g)$ induces a system of constraint partial differential equations on $\Sigma$, which we
prove to be equivalent to an exterior differential system involving a cohomological condition
on the shape operator of the embedding $\Sigma\hookrightarrow M$. Solutions of this differential
system are precisely the allowed initial data for the evolution problem of a parallel spinor and
define the notion of parallel Cauchy pair $(\mathfrak{e},\Theta)$, where $\mathfrak{e}$ is a
coframe and $\Theta$ is a symmetric two-tensor. We characterize all parallel Cauchy pairs on simply
connected Cauchy surfaces, refining a result of Baum, Leistner and Lischewski. Furthermore, we
classify all compact three-manifolds admitting parallel Cauchy pairs, proving that they are canonically
equipped with a locally free action of $\mathbb{R}^2$ and are isomorphic to certain torus bundles
over $S^1$, whose Riemannian structure we characterize in detail. Moreover, we classify all left-invariant
parallel Cauchy pairs on simply connected Lie groups, specifying when they are allowed initial
data for the Ricci flat equations and when the shape operator is Codazzi. Finally, we give a novel
geometric interpretation of a class of parallel spinor flows and solve it in several examples, obtaining
explicit families of four-dimensional Lorentzian manifolds carrying parallel spinors.

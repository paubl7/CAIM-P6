The central question in this article is how information does leak out from black holes. Relying on
algebraic arguments and the concept of superselection sectors, we propose the existence of certain
operators whose correlations extend across the black hole atmosphere and range into the interior.
Contained in the full algebra, these black hole intertwiners will not belong to the subalgebra describing
semiclassical bulk physics. We study this proposal in the context of operator reconstructions
for code spaces containing a large number of microstates. As long as the atmosphere is excluded from
a particular subsystem, the global state seen under the action of the associated algebra is maximally
mixed and therefore described by a single classical background. Once the relevant correlations
are encoded, i.e. if the algebra is sufficiently enlarged, perfect state distinguishability becomes
possible. We arrive at this by computing the von Neumann entropy which may explain the result obtained
by applying the quantum extremal surface prescription to the mixed state. We then examine these
insights in the context of black hole evaporation and argue that information is transferred to the
radiation via black hole intertwiners. We derive the Page curve. The mechanism above suggests that
black hole information is topologically protected. An infalling observer would experience no
drama. This may resolve the unitarity problem without running into any firewall or state puzzle,
the latter being evident in generalized entropy computations. We also examine the question of how
certain wormhole topologies may be understood given these findings. We argue that their occurrence
in gravity replica computations may be related to the maximal correlation between radiation and
atmosphere surrounding the old black hole. This may suggest a connection between topology change
and near horizon quantum gravitational effects.

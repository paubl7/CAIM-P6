One of the most interesting candidates for dark matter are massive real scalar particles. A well-motivated
example is from a pure Yang-Mills hidden sector, which locks up into glueballs in the early universe.
The lightest glueball states are scalar particles and can act as a form of bosonic dark matter. If
self-interactions are repulsive this can potentially lead to very massive boson stars, where the
inward gravitational force is balanced by the repulsive self-interaction. This can also arise
from elementary real scalars with a regular potential. In the literature it has been claimed that
this allows for astrophysically significant boson stars with high compactness, which could undergo
binary mergers and generate detectable gravitational waves. Here we show that previous analyses
did not take into proper account $3 \to 2$ and $4 \to 2$ quantum mechanical annihilation processes
in the core of the star, while other work miscalculated the $3 \to 1$ process. In this work, we compute
the annihilation rates, finding that massive stars will rapidly decay from the $3 \to 2$ or $4 \to
2$ processes (while the $3 \to 1$ process is typically small). Using the Einstein-Klein-Gordon
equations, we also estimate the binding energy of these stars, showing that even the densest stars
do not have quite enough binding energy to prevent annihilations. For such boson stars to live for
the current age of the universe and to be consistent with bounds on dark matter scattering in galaxies,
we find the following upper bound on their mass for $O(1)$ self-interaction couplings: $M_* < 10^{-18}
M_{sun}$ when $3 \to 2$ processes are allowed and $M_* < 10^{-11} M_{sun}$ when only $4 \to 2$ processes
are allowed. We also estimate destabilization from parametric resonance which can considerably
constrain the phase space further. Furthermore, such stars are required to have very small compactness
to be long lived.

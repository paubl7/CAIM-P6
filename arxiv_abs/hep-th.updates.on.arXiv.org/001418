Braneworld scenarios appear in dynamical string tension theories, where string tension is positive
between two surfaces separated by a short distance and at the two surfaces themselves the string
tensions become infinite, therefore producing an effective confinement of the strings and therefore
of all matter and gravity to the space between these to surfaces. The specific model studied is in
the context of the modified measure formulation the string where tension appear as an additional
dynamical degree of freedom and these tensions are not universal, but rather each string generates
its own tension, which can have a different value for each string. We consider a new background field
that can couple to these strings, the tension scalar is capable then of changing locally along the
world sheet and then the value of the tension of the string object changes accordingly along the world
sheet. Sting tension appears dynamically and each string tension has a characteristic constant
of integration that appears as a consequence of the dynamical tension generation . When many types
of strings probing the same region of space are considered this tension scalar is constrained by
the requirement of quantum conformal invariance. For the case of two types of strings probing the
same region of space with different dynamically generated tensions (characterized by different
constants of integration) , there are two different metrics, associated to the different strings,
that have to satisfy vacuum Einsteins equations and the consistency of these two Einsteins equations
determine that the tension field behaves. The two metrics are flat space in Minkowshi space and flat
space after a special conformal transformation, then the strings are confined inside a light like
Segment or alternatively as expanding Braneworlds where the strings are confined between two expanding
bubbles.

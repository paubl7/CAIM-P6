The Hamiltonian theory for the collective longitudinally polarized colorless gluon excitations
(plasmons) and for collective quark-antiquark excitations with abnormal relation between chirality
and helicity (plasminos) in a high-temperature quark-gluon plasma (QGP) is developed. For this
purpose, Zakharov's forma\-lism for constructing the wave theory in nonlinear media with dispersion
is used. A generalization of the Poisson superbracket with anticommuting variables to the case
of a continuous medium is performed and the corresponding Hamilton equations are presented. The
canonical transformations including simultaneously both bosonic and fermionic degrees of freedom
of the collective excitations in QGP are discussed and a complete system of the canonicity conditions
for these transformations is written out. An explicit form of the effective fourth-order Hamiltonians
describing the elastic scattering of plasmino off plasmon and plasmino off plasmon is found and
the Boltzmann type kinetic equations describing the processes of elastic scattering are obtained.
A detailed comparison of the effective amplitudes defined within the (pseudo)classical Hamiltonian
theory, with the corresponding matrix elements calcu\-la\-ted early in the framework of high-temperature
quantum chromodynamics in the so-called hard thermal loop approximation is performed. This enables
one to obtain, in particular, an explicit form of the vertex and coefficient functions in the effective
amplitudes and in the canonical transformations, correspondingly, and also to define the validity
of a purely classical approach in the Hamiltonian description of the dynamics of quark-gluon plasma.
The problem of determining the higher coefficient functions in the canonical transformations
of fermionic and bosonic normal variables is considered.

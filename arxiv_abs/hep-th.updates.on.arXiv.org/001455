We study the influence of angular momentum on quantum complexity for CFT states holographically
dual to rotating black holes. Using the holographic complexity=action (CA) and complexity=volume
(CV) proposals, we study the full time dependence of complexity and the complexity of formation
for two dimensional states dual to rotating BTZ. The obtained results and their dependence on angular
momentum turn out to be analogous to those of charged states dual to Reissner-Nordstr\"om AdS black
holes. For CA, our computation carefully accounts for the counterterm in the gravity action, which
was not included in previous analysis in the literature. This affects the complexity early time
dependence and its effect becomes negligible close to extremality. In the grand canonical ensemble,
the CA and CV complexity of formation are linear in the temperature, and diverge with the same structure
in the speed of light angular velocity limit. For CA the inclusion of the counterterm is crucial for
both effects. We also address the problem of studying holographic complexity for higher dimensional
rotating black holes, focusing on the four dimensional Kerr-AdS case. Carefully taking into account
all ingredients, we show that the late time limit of the CA growth rate saturates the expected bound,
and find the CV complexity of formation of large black holes diverges in the critical angular velocity
limit. Our holographic analysis is complemented by the study of circuit complexity in a two dimensional
free scalar model for a thermofield double (TFD) state with angular momentum. We show how this can
be given a description in terms of non-rotating TFD states introducing mode-by-mode effective
temperatures and times. We comment on the similarities and differences of the holographic and QFT
complexity results.

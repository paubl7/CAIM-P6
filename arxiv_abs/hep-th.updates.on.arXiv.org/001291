We classify all fundamental electrically charged thin shells in general relativity, i.e., static
spherically symmetric perfect fluid thin shells with a Minkowski spacetime interior and a Reissner-Nordstr\"om
spacetime exterior, characterized by the spacetime mass and electric charge. The fundamental
shell can exist in three states, nonextremal, extremal, and overcharged. The nonextremal state
allows the shell to be located such that its radius can be outside its own gravitational radius, or
can be inside its own Cauchy radius. The extremal state allows the shell to be located such that its
radius can be outside its own gravitational radius, or can be inside it. The overcharged state allows
the shell to be located anywhere. There is a further division, one has to specify the orientation
of the shell, i.e., whether the normal out of the shell points toward increasing or decreasing radii.
There is still a subdivision in the extremal state when the shell is at the gravitational radius,
in that the shell can approach it from above or from below. The shell is assumed to be composed of an
electrically charged perfect fluid, and the energy conditions are tested. Carter-Penrose diagrams
are drawn for the shell spacetimes. There are fourteen cases in the classification of the fundamental
shells, namely, nonextremal star shells, nonextremal tension shell black holes, nonextremal
tension shell regular and nonregular black holes, nonextremal compact shell naked singularities,
Majumdar-Papapetrou star shells, extremal tension shell singularities, extremal tension shell
regular and nonregular black holes, Majumdar-Papapetrou compact shell naked singularities,
Majumdar-Papapetrou shell quasiblack holes, extremal null shell quasinonblack holes, extremal
null shell singularities, Majumdar-Papapetrou null shell singularities, overcharged star shells,
and overcharged compact shell naked singularities.

A rapid phantom transition of the dark energy equation of state parameter $w$ at a transition redshift
$z_t<0.1$ of the form $w(z)=-1+\Delta w\;\Theta (z_t-z)$ with $\Delta w<0$ can lead to a higher
value of the Hubble constant while closely mimicking a Planck18/$\Lambda$CDM form of the comoving
distance $r(z)=\int_0^z\frac{dz'}{H(z')}$ for $z>z_t$. Such a transition however would imply
a significantly lower value of the SnIa absolute magnitude $M$ than the value $M_C$ imposed by local
Cepheid calibrators at $z<0.01$. Thus, in order to resolve the $H_0$ tension it would need to be accompanied
by a similar transition in the value of the SnIa absolute magnitude $M$ as $M(z)=M_C+\Delta M \;\Theta
(z-z_t)$ with $\Delta M<0$. This is a Late $w-M$ phantom transition ($LwMPT$). It may be achieved
by a sudden reduction of the value of the normalized effective Newton constant $\mu=G_{\rm{eff}}/G_{\rm{N}}$
by about $6\%$ assuming that the absolute luminosity of SnIa is proportional to the Chandrasekhar
mass which varies as $\mu^{-3/2}$. We demonstrate that such an ultra low $z$ abrupt feature of $w-M$
provides a better fit to cosmological data compared to smooth late time deformations of $H(z)$ that
also address the Hubble tension. For $z_t=0.02$ we find $\Delta w\simeq -4$, $\Delta M \simeq -0.1$.
This model also addresses the growth tension due to the predicted lower value of $\mu$ at $z>z_t$.
A prior of $\Delta w=0$ (no $w$ transition) can still resolve the $H_0$ tension with a larger amplitude
$M$ transition with $\Delta M\simeq -0.2$ at $z_t\simeq 0.01$. This implies a larger reduction
of $\mu$ for $z>0.01$ (about $12\%$). The $LwMPT$ can be generically induced by a scalar field non-minimally
coupled to gravity with no need of a screening mechanism since in this model $\mu=1$ at $z<0.01$.

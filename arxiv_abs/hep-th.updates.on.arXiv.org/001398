We study the structure of scattering amplitudes of the Kaluza-Klein (KK) gravitons and of the gravitational
KK Goldstone bosons in the compactified 5d General Relativity (GR). We analyze the geometric Higgs
mechanism for mass-generation of KK gravitons under compactification with a general $R_\xi$ gauge-fixing,
which is free from vDVZ discontinuity. Then, we formulate the Gravitational Equivalence Theorem
(GET) to connect the longitudinal KK graviton amplitudes to the KK Goldstone amplitudes, which
is a manifestation of the geometric Higgs mechanism at $S$-matrix level. We directly compute the
tree-level KK Goldstone amplitudes which equal the longitudinal KK graviton amplitudes in the
high energy limit. We further use the double-copy method with color-kinematics duality to reconstruct,
under high energy expansion, the KK longitudinal graviton (Goldstone) amplitudes from the KK longitudinal
gauge boson (Goldstone) amplitudes in the compactified 5d Yang-Mills (YM) theory. From these,
we reconstruct the GET of the KK longitudinal graviton (Goldstone) amplitudes in the 5d GR from the
KK longitudinal gauge boson (Goldstone) amplitudes in the 5d YM theory. Using either the GET or the
double-copy reconstruction, we provide a theoretical mechanism showing that the sum of all the
energy-power terms [up to $O(E^{10})$] in the high-energy longitudinal KK graviton amplitudes
must cancel down to $O(E^2)$ as enforced by matching the energy-power dependence of the corresponding
KK Goldstone amplitudes or by matching that of the double-copy amplitudes from the KK YM theory.
With the double-copy approach, we establish a new correspondence between the two energy-cancellations:
$E^4 \to E^0$ in the 5d KK YM theory and $E^{10} \to E^2$ in the 5d KK GR theory. We further analyze the
structure of the residual terms in the GET and uncover a new energy-cancellation mechanism therein.

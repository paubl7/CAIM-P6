We discuss tensor categories motivated by CFT, their unitarizability and applications to various
models including the affine VOAs. We discuss classification of type A Verlinde fusion categories.
We propose an approach to Kazhdan-Lusztig-Finkelberg theorem. This theorem gives a ribbon equivalence
between the fusion category associated to a quantum group at a certain root of unity and that associated
to a corresponding affine vertex operator algebra at a suitable positive integer level. We develop
ideas by Wenzl. Our results rely on the notion of weak-quasi-Hopf algebra of Drinfeld-Mack-Schomerus.
We were also guided by Drinfeld original proof, by Bakalov and Kirillov and Neshveyev and Tuset work
for a generic parameter. Wenzl described a fusion tensor product in quantum group fusion categories,
and related it to the unitary structure. Given two irreducible objects, the inner product of the
fusion tensor product is induced by the braiding of U_q(g), with q a suitable root of 1. Moreover,
the paper suggests a suitable untwisting procedure to make the unitary structure trivial. Then
it also describes a continuous path that intuitively connects objects of the quantum group fusion
category to representations of the simple Lie group defining the affine Lie algebra. We study this
procedure. One of our main results is the construction of a Hopf algebra in a weak sense associated
to quantum group fusion category and of a twist of it giving a wqh structure on the Zhu algebra and a
unitary modular fusion category structure on the representation category of the affine Lie algebra.
We show that this modular fusion category structure is equivalent to that obtained via the tensor
product theory of VOAs by Huang and Lepowsky. This gives a direct proof of FKL theorem.

Quantum many-body systems subjected to local measurements at a nonzero rate can be in distinct dynamical
phases, with differing entanglement properties. We introduce theoretical approaches to measurement-induced
phase transitions (MPT) and also to entanglement transitions in random tensor networks. Many of
our results are for "all-to-all" quantum circuits with unitaries and measurements, in which any
qubit can couple to any other, and related settings where some of the complications of low-dimensional
models are reduced. We also propose field theory descriptions for spatially local systems of finite
dimensionality. To build intuition, we first solve the simplest "minimal cut" toy model for entanglement
dynamics in all-to-all circuits, finding scaling forms and exponents within this approximation.
We then show that certain all-to-all measurement circuits allow exact results by exploiting the
circuit's local tree-like structure. For this reason, we make a detour to give universal results
for entanglement phase transitions in a class of random tree tensor networks, making a connection
with the classical theory of directed polymers on a tree. We then compare these results with numerics
in all-to-all circuits, both for the MPT and for the simpler "Forced Measurement Phase Transition"
(FMPT). We characterize the two different phases in all-to-all circuits using observables that
are sensitive to the amount of information propagated between the initial and final time. We demonstrate
signatures of the two phases that can be understood from simple models. Finally we propose Landau-Ginsburg-Wilson-like
field theories for the MPT, the FMPT, and for entanglement transitions in tensor networks. This
analysis shows a surprising difference between the MPT and the other cases. We discuss variants
of the measurement problem with additional structure, and questions for the future.

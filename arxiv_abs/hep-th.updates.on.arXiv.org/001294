Polarization of a vacuum as well as of dispersive and dissipative dielectric media with piece-wise
and smooth inhomogeneities is studied with the goal to clarify the question of renormalizability
of diverging electromagnetic stress-energy tensor. First, the stress tensor is computed with
the Lifshitz approach to London forces in the non-retarded limit, which after the substraction
of the leading free space ultraviolet divergencies still retains the divergencies associated
with the presence of sharp boundaries between piece-wise inhomogeneities. We call these contributions
finite because they become renormalized after a sharp interface is replaced with a dielectric permittivity
changing according to a smooth function of spatial coordinates. In addition, such a smoothed out
interface exhibits new subleading ultraviolet divergencies that appear due to its internal structure.
To systematically deal with the polarization of inhomogeneous media, the Hadamard expansion is
applied to single out both finite and subleading contributions and to unequivocally demonstrate
incomplete renormalizability of the Lifshitz theory. The above approach also allows us to reveal
the nature of surface tension, which proves to be purely quantum mechanical. The deduced theory
of surface tension and its calculations for real dielectric media are favorably compared to the
available experimental data. While the sharp interface limit recovers the classical boundary
conditions for the electric field and uncovers the origin of the apparent local divergencies of
the renormalized stresses in the sharp interface formulation previously pointed out in the literature,
the problem of surface tension proves to be of a distinguished limit type because the sharp interface
formulation loses the information about the internal structure of an interface and hence cannot
explain the origin of surface tension.

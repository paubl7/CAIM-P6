Braiding phases among topological excitations are key data for physically characterizing topological
orders. In this paper, we provide a field-theoretical approach towards a complete list of mutually
compatible braiding phases of topological orders in (3+1)D spacetime. More concretely, considering
a discrete gauge group as input data, topological excitations in this paper are bosonic \particles
carrying gauge charges and loops carrying gauge fluxes. Among these excitations, there are three
classes of root braiding processes: particle-loop braidings (i.e., the familiar Aharonov-Bohm
phase of winding an electric charge around a thin magnetic solenoid), multi-loop braidings [Phys.
Rev. Lett. 113, 080403 (2014)], and particle-loop-loop braidings [i.e., Borromean Rings braiding
in Phys. Rev. Lett. 121, 061601 (2018)]. A naive way to exhaust all topological orders is to arbitrarily
combine these root braiding processes. Surprisingly, we find that there exist illegitimate combinations
in which certain braiding phases cannot coexist, i.e., are mutually incompatible. Thus, the resulting
topological orders are illegitimate and must be excluded. It is not obvious to identify these illegitimate
combinations. But with the help of the powerful (3+1)D topological quantum field theories (TQFTs),
we find that illegitimate combinations violate gauge invariance. In this way, we are able to obtain
all sets of mutually compatible braiding phases and all legitimate topological orders. To illustrate,
we work out all details when gauge groups are $\mathbb{Z}_{N_1},\mathbb{Z}_{N_1}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_2},\mathbb{Z}_{N_1}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_2}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_3}$,
and $\mathbb{Z}_{N_1}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_2}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_3}\times\mathbb{Z}_{N_4}$.
Finally, we concisely discuss compatible braidings and TQFTs in (4+1)D spacetime.

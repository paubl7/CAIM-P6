Here I develop the connection between thermodynamics, entanglement, and gravity. I begin by showing
that the classical null energy condition (NEC) can arise as a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics
applied to local holographic screens. This is accomplished by essentially reversing the steps
of Hawking's area theorem, leading to the Ricci convergence condition as an input, from which an
application of Einstein's equations yields the NEC -- even in the presence of 1-loop quantum corrections
to the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy formula. Then, by attributing thermodynamics to the stretched
horizon of future lightcones -- a timelike hypersurface generated by a collection of radially accelerating
observers with constant and uniform proper acceleration -- I derive Einstein's equations from
the Clausius relation $T\Delta S_{\text{rev}}=Q$, where $\Delta S_{\text{rev}}$ is the reversible
entropy change. Based on this derivation I uncover a local first law of gravity, $\Delta E=T\Delta
S-W$, connecting gravitational entropy $S$ to matter energy $E$ and work $W$. I then provide an entanglement
interpretation of stretched lightcone thermodynamics by extending the entanglement equilibrium
proposal. Using the $\text{AdS}_{3}/\text{CFT}_{2}$ correspondence, I then provide a microscopic
explanation of the `thermodynamic volume' in extended black hole thermodynamics and reveal the
super-entropicity of $\text{AdS}_{3}$ black holes is due to the gravitational entropy overcounting
the number of available dual $\text{CFT}_{2}$ states. Finally, I conclude by providing a recent
generalization of the extended first law of entanglement, and study its non-trivial 2+1- and 1+1-dimensional
limits, including an extended first law for Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity. This thesis is self-contained
and pedagogical by including useful background content relevant to emergent gravity.

We make forecasts for the impact a future "midband" space-based gravitational wave experiment,
most sensitive to $10^{-2}- 10 $ Hz, could have on potential detections of cosmological stochastic
gravitational wave backgrounds (SGWBs). Specific proposed midband experiments considered are
TianGo, B-DECIGO and AEDGE. We propose a combined power-law integrated sensitivity (CPLS) curve
combining GW experiments over different frequency bands, which shows the midband improves sensitivity
to SGWBs by up to two orders of magnitude at $10^{-2} - 10$ Hz. We consider GW emission from cosmic strings
and phase transitions as benchmark examples of cosmological SGWBs. We explicitly model various
astrophysical SGWB sources, most importantly from unresolved black hole mergers. Using Markov
Chain Monte Carlo, we demonstrated that midband experiments can, when combined with LIGO A+ and
LISA, significantly improve sensitivities to cosmological SGWBs and better separate them from
astrophysical SGWBs. In particular, we forecast that a midband experiment improves sensitivity
to cosmic string tension $G\mu$ by up to a factor of $10$, driven by improved component separation
from astrophysical sources. For phase transitions, a midband experiment can detect signals peaking
at $0.1 - 1$ Hz, which for our fiducial model corresponds to early Universe temperatures of $T_*\sim
10^4 - 10^6$ GeV, generally beyond the reach of LIGO and LISA. The midband closes an energy gap and
better captures characteristic spectral shape information. It thus substantially improves measurement
of the properties of phase transitions at lower energies of $T_* \sim O(10^3)$ GeV, potentially
relevant to new physics at the electroweak scale, whereas in this energy range LISA alone will detect
an excess but not effectively measure the phase transition parameters. Our modelling code and chains
are publicly available.

The gravitational three-body problem is a rich open problem, dating back to Newton. It serves as
a prototypical example of a chaotic system and has numerous applications in astrophysics. Generically,
the motion is non-integrable and susceptible to disintegration, and for negative total energy
the decay outcome is a free body flying apart from a binary. Since Poincar\'e, the problem is known
to be chaotic and is believed to lack a general deterministic solution. Instead, decades ago a statistical
solution was marked as a goal. Yet, despite considerable progress, all extant approaches display
two flaws. First, probability was equated with phase space volume, thereby ignoring the fact that
significant regions of phase space describe regular motion, including post-decay motion. Secondly
and relatedly, an adjustable parameter, the strong interaction region, which is a sort of cutoff,
was a central ingredient of the theory. This paper introduces remedies and presents for the first
time a statistical prediction of decay rates, in addition to outcomes. Based on an analogy with a
particle moving within a leaky container, the statistical distribution is presented in an exactly
factorized form. One factor is the flux of phase-space volume, rather than the volume itself, and
it is given in a cutoff-independent closed-form. The other factors are the chaotic absorptivity
and the regularized phase space volume. The situation is analogous to Kirchhoff's law of thermal
radiation, also known as greybody radiation. In addition, an equation system for the time evolution
of the statistical distribution is introduced; it describes the decay rate statistics while accounting
for sub-escape excursions. Early numerical tests indicate a leap in accuracy.

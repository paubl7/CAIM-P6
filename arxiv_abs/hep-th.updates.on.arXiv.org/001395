In this paper, we shall consider spherically symmetric spacetime solutions describing the interior
of stellar compact objects, in the context of higher-order curvature theory of the f(R) type. We
shall derive the non--vacuum field equations of the higher-order curvature theory, without assuming
any specific form of the $\mathrm{f(R)}$ theory, specifying the analysis for a spherically symmetric
spacetime with two unknown functions. We obtain a system of highly non-linear differential equations,
which consists of four differential equations with six unknown functions. To solve such a system,
we assume a specific form of metric potentials, using the Krori-Barua ansatz. We successfully solve
the system of differential equations, and we derive all the components of the energy-momentum tensor.
Moreover, we derive the non-trivial general form of $\mathrm{f(R)}$ that may generate such solutions
and calculate the dynamic Ricci scalar of the anisotropic star. Accordingly, we calculate the asymptotic
form of the function $\mathrm{f(R)}$, which is a polynomial function. We match the derived interior
solution with the exterior one, which was derived in \cite{Nashed:2019tuk}, with the latter also
resulting in a non-trivial form of the Ricci scalar. Notably but rather expected, the exterior solution
differs from the Schwarzschild one in the context of general relativity. The matching procedure
will eventually relate two constants with the mass and radius of the compact stellar object. We list
the necessary conditions that any compact anisotropic star must satisfy and explain in detail that
our model bypasses all of these conditions for a special compact star $\textit {Her X--1 }$, which
has an estimated mass and radius \textit {(mass = 0.85 $\pm 0.15M_{\circledcirc}$\,\, and\, \,radius
$= 8.1 \pm 0.41$km)}.

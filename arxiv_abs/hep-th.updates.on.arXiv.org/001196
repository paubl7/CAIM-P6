Fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states are examples of symmetry-enriched topological states (SETs):
in addition to the intrinsic topological order, which is robust to symmetry breaking, they possess
symmetry-protected topological invariants, such as fractional charge of anyons and fractional
Hall conductivity. In this paper we develop a comprehensive theory of symmetry-protected topological
invariants for FQH states with spatial symmetries, which applies to Abelian and non-Abelian topological
states, by using a recently developed framework of $G$-crossed braided tensor categories ($G\times$BTCs)
for SETs. We consider systems with $U(1)$ charge conservation, magnetic translational, and spatial
rotational symmetries, in the continuum and for all $5$ orientation-preserving crystalline space
groups in two dimensions, allowing arbitrary rational magnetic flux per unit cell, and assuming
that symmetries do not permute anyons. In the crystalline setting, applicable to fractional Chern
insulators and spin liquids, symmetry fractionalization is fully characterized by a generalization
to non-Abelian states of the charge, spin, discrete torsion, and area vectors, which specify fractional
charge, angular momentum, linear momentum, and fractionalization of the translation algebra
for each anyon. The topological response theory contains $9$ terms, which attach charge, linear
momentum, and angular momentum to magnetic flux, lattice dislocations, disclinations, corners,
and units of area. Using the $G\times$BTC formalism, we derive the formula relating charge filling
to the Hall conductivity and flux per unit cell; in the continuum this relates the filling fraction
and the Hall conductivity without assuming Galilean invariance. We provide systematic formulas
for topological invariants within the $G\times$BTC framework; this gives, for example, a new categorical
definition of the Hall conductivity.

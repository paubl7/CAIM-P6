Considering marginally relevant and relevant deformations of the weakly coupled $(3+1)$-dimensional
large $N$ conformal gauge theories introduced in arXiv:2011.13981, we study the patterns of phase
transitions in these systems that lead to a symmetry-broken phase in the high temperature limit.
These deformations involve only the scalar fields in the models. The marginally relevant deformations
are obtained by varying certain double trace quartic couplings between the scalar fields. The relevant
deformations, on the other hand, are obtained by adding masses to the scalar fields while keeping
all the couplings frozen at their fixed point values. At the $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit, the RG
flows triggered by these deformations approach the aforementioned weakly coupled CFTs in the UV
regime. These UV fixed points lie on a conformal manifold with the shape of a circle in the space of
couplings. In certain parameter regimes a subset of points on this manifold exhibits thermal order
characterized by the spontaneous breaking of a global $\mathbb Z_2$ or $U(1)$ symmetry and Higgsing
of a subset of gauge bosons at all nonzero temperatures. We show that the RG flows triggered by the
marginally relevant deformations lead to a weakly coupled IR fixed point which lacks the thermal
order. Thus, the systems defined by these RG flows undergo a transition from a disordered phase at
low temperatures to an ordered phase at high temperatures. This provides examples of both inverse
symmetry breaking and symmetry nonrestoration. For the relevant deformations, we demonstrate
that a variety of phase transitions are possible depending on the signs and magnitudes of the masses
(squared) added to the scalar fields. Using thermal perturbation theory, we derive the approximate
values of the critical temperatures for all these phase transitions. All the results are obtained
at the $N\rightarrow\infty$ limit.

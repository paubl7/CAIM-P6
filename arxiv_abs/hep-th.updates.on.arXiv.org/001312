Topological orders, as an emergent phenomenon, can be realized in strongly correlated condensed
matter systems or strongly-coupled quantum field theories. In this condensed-matter oriented
field-theoretical paper, by considering a cyclic gauge group $G=\prod_{i=1}^n\mathbb{Z}_{N_i}$,
we study topological orders in five (spacetime) dimensions in which topological excitations include
not only point-like \textit{particles}, but also spatially extended objects: closed-string-like
loops and two-dimensional closed membranes. Their low-energy effective theories are topological
quantum field theories (TQFT) with various exotic topological terms consisting of Abelian gauge
fields of $1$-form $A$, $2$-form $B$, and $3$-form $C$. In all these TQFTs, there are two types of
$BF$ terms with twists, some of which are beyond Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories, i.e., not classified
by $H^{5}(G, \mathbb{R}/\mathbb{Z})$. Braiding statistics among topological excitations is
exhausted by following the gauge invariance principle and combining topological terms that are
mutually compatible. In this way, we obtain the complete list of TQFTs within the present theoretical
framework. Since the boundary theory of a topological order exhibits gravitational anomaly following
Wen's definition, the boundary theory cannot be realized alone unless a higher-dimensional bulk
is added for canceling out the anomaly. Therefore, our studies are also an attempt towards a more
complete list of gravitational anomalies and impossible quantum spin liquids in four dimensions
with gauge group $G$. The physical theory of this paper also indicates that there are highly unexplored
connections between mathematical link theory of spatially extended objects and their realization
in topological orders.

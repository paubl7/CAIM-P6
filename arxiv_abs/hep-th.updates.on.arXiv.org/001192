We introduce a general statistical method for estimating first-order magnetic field fluctuations
generated from primordial black hole (PBH) populations. To that end, we consider monochromatic
and extended Press-Schechter PBH mass functions for different formation scenarios, such that
each constituent is capable of producing its own magnetic field due to some given physical mechanism.
Assuming the simplest linear correlation between magnetic field fluctuations and matter over-densities,
our estimates depend on the mass function, on the physical field generation mechanism by each PBH
constituent, and on a certain PBH characteristic distance which is also introduced in this work.
After studying the statistics of magnetic field fluctuations by defining the corresponding magnetic
power spectrum, we apply our general formalism to study the plausibility that two particular field
generation mechanisms could have given rise to the expected seed fields according to current observational
constraints. The first example is the Biermann battery as a prominent primordial seed field generation
candidate, and the second one is due to the accretion of magnetic monopoles at PBH formation, constituting
magnetic PBHs. Our results show that, for monochromatic distributions, it does not seem to be possible
to generate sufficiently intense seed fields in any of the two field generation mechanisms explored
here. For extended distributions, it is also not possible to generate the required seed field by
only assuming a Biermann battery mechanism. In fact, we report an average seed field by this mechanism
of about 10^{-47} G, at z = 20. For the case of magnetic monopoles we instead assume that the seed values
from the literature are achieved and calculate the necessary number density of monopoles. In this
case we obtain values that are below the upper limits from current constraints.

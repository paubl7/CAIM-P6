Disordered mechanical systems with high connectivity represent a limit opposite to the more familiar
case of disordered crystals. Individual ions in a crystal are subjected essentially to nearest-neighbor
interactions. In contrast, the systems studied in this paper have all their degrees of freedom coupled
to each other. Thus, the problem of linearized small oscillations of such systems involves two full
positive-definite and non-commuting matrices, as opposed to the sparse matrices associated with
disordered crystals. Consequently, the familiar methods for determining the averaged vibrational
spectra of disordered crystals, introduced many years ago by Dyson and Schmidt, are inapplicable
for highly connected disordered systems. In this paper we apply random matrix theory to calculate
the averaged vibrational spectra of such systems, in the limit of infinitely large system size.
We calculate the average spectrum of the product of two positive definite random matrices by means
of free probability theory techniques. We also show that this problem is intimately related with
quasi-hermitian random matrix theory. The analytical results we obtain for the spectrum agree
well with our numerical results. The latter also exhibit oscillations at the high-frequency band
edge, which fit well the Airy kernel pattern. We also compute inverse participation ratios of the
corresponding amplitude eigenvectors and demonstrate that they are all extended, in contrast
with conventional disordered crystals. In addition to matrix model analysis, we study the vibrational
spectra of various multi-segmented disordered pendula, as concrete realizations of highly connected
mechanical systems. A universal feature of the density of vibration modes, common to both pendula
and the matrix model, is that it tends to a non-zero constant at vanishing frequency.

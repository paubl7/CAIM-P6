In this paper we study the role of planarity in generalized scattering amplitudes, through several
closely interacting structures in combinatorics, algebraic and tropical geometry. The generalized
biadjoint scalar amplitude, introduced recently by Cachazo-Early-Guevara-Mizera (CEGM), is
a rational function of homogeneous degree $-(k-1)(n-k-1)$ in $\binom{n}{k}-n$ independent variables;
its poles can be constructed directly from the rays of the positive tropical Grassmannian. We introduce
for each pair of integers $(k,n)$ with $2\le k\le n-2$ a system of generalized positive roots which
arises as a specialization of the planar basis of kinematic invariants. We prove that the higher
root polytope $\mathcal{R}^{(k)}_{n-k}$ has volume the k-dimensional Catalan number $C^{(k)}_{n-k}$,
via a flag unimodular triangulation into simplices, in bijection with noncrossing collections
of $k$-element subsets. We also give a bijection between certain positroidal subdivisions, called
tripods, of the hypersimplex $\Delta_{3,n}$ and noncrossing pairs of 3-element subsets that are
not weakly separated. We show that the facets of the Planar Kinematics (PK) polytope, introduced
recently by Cachazo and the author, are exactly the $\binom{n}{k}-n$ generalized positive roots.
We show that the PK specialization of the generalized biadjoint amplitude evaluates to $C^{(k)}_{n-k}$.
Looking forward, we give defining equations and conjecture explicit solutions using $(\mathbb{CP}^{n-k-1})^{\times
(k-1)}$ via a notion of compatibility degree for noncrossing collections, for a two parameter family
of generalized worldsheet associahedra $\mathcal{W}^+_{k,n}$. These specialize when $k=2$
to a certain dihedrally invariant partial compactification of the configuration space $M_{0,n}$
of $n$ distinct points in $\mathbb{CP}^{1}$. Many detailed examples are given throughout to motivate
future work.

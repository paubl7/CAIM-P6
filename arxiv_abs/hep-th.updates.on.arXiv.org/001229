Equivariant localization theory is a powerful tool that has been extensively used in the past thirty
years to elegantly obtain exact integration formulas, in both mathematics and physics. These integration
formulas are proved within the mathematical formalism of equivariant cohomology, a variant of
standard cohomology theory that incorporates the presence of a symmetry group acting on the space
at hand. A suitable infinite-dimensional generalization of this formalism is applicable to a certain
class of Quantum Field Theories (QFT) endowed with supersymmetry. In this thesis we review the formalism
of equivariant localization and some of its applications in Quantum Mechanics (QM) and QFT. We start
from the mathematical description of equivariant cohomology and related localization theorems
of finite-dimensional integrals in the case of an Abelian group action, and then we discuss their
formal application to infinite-dimensional path integrals in QFT. We summarize some examples
from the literature of computations of partition functions and expectation values of supersymmetric
operators in various dimensions. For 1-dimensional QFT, that is QM, we review the application of
the localization principle to the derivation of the Atiyah-Singer index theorem applied to the
Dirac operator on a twisted spinor bundle. In 3 and 4 dimensions, we examine the computation of expectation
values of certain Wilson loops in supersymmetric gauge theories and their relation to 0-dimensional
theories described by "matrix models". Finally, we review the formalism of non-Abelian localization
applied to 2-dimensional Yang-Mills theory and its application in the mapping between the standard
"physical" theory and a related "cohomological" formulation.

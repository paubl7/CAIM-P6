There has recently been an increasing interest in regularizations of Lovelock-Lanczos gravity
(LLG) in four dimensions, in which dimensional poles and possibly counter-terms are introduced
to compensate the vanishing of the Lovelock field equations in critical and lower dimensions. In
this paper, we review and extend some of these results. We first find a class of LLG theories whose
perturbative expansion around a given (A)dS vacuum can be regularized up to arbitrary order, the
simplest one being close to Lovelock gravities with a unique vacuum. If well-defined, these models
might be interpreted as effective field theories of gravitons in four dimensions, or might be combined
with other regularization approaches. Among those, we establish the general procedure to obtain
$4$D covariant and background independent regularizations from metric transformations. In the
conformal (and critical) case, we generalize previous results obtained for the Gauss-Bonnet theory
to the full Lovelock series. Similarly, the regularization of Gauss-Bonnet gravity from the breaking
of $4$D-covariance down to $3$D is generalized to arbitrary curvature order, seemingly resulting
in new Minimally Modified gravities propagating solely the two degrees of freedom of the graviton.
Finally, we present general results regarding the minisuperspace regularization of specific
sectors of LLG. Non-perturbative (in curvature) regularized theories admitting non-singular
black holes as well as non-singular past-dS$_4$ and cyclic closed cosmologies are found. We conclude
with the non-uniqueness of these background regularizations by finding inequivalent regularizations
of the Bianchi I sector of Lovelock-Lanczos gravity in four dimensions.

In this note we consider Coulomb-branch chiral primary correlation functions in ${\cal N} = 2$ superconformal
QCD with gauge group $SU(2)$, in the limit of large R-charge ${\cal J} = 2n$ for the chiral primary
operators $[{\cal O}(x)]^ n$ with the inverse gauge coupling $\tau$ held fixed. In previous work,
these correlation functions were determined to all orders in $n$, up to unknown exponentially small
corrections. In this paper we determine the first several orders of the asymptotic expansion of
the exponentially small correction itself. To do this we use: the physical interpretation of the
exponentially small correction as the virtual propagation of a massive BPS particle, to fix the
leading term in the expansion; the supersymmetric recursion relations to derive differential
equations for the coupling-dependence of the subleading terms; and the double-scaling limit,
to fix undetermined coefficients in the solution of the differential equation. We calculate the
expansion of the exponentially small term up to and including relative order $n^{-{5\over 2}}$.
We also use the recursion relations to calculate the subleading large-${\cal J}$ corrections to
the exponentially small correction in the double-scaling limit, up to and including relative order
$n^{-5}$ at fixed double-scaled coupling $\lambda$. We compare the expansion to exact results
from supersymmetric localization at the coupling $\tau = {{25}\over \pi} i$, up to $n=150$. At values
$n\sim 100-150$, we find the fixed-coupling and double-scaled large-R-charge expansions are
accurate to within one part in $10^ 6$ and $10^ 8$, respectively, of the size of the exponentially
small correction itself. Relative to the full correlator including the dominant EFT contribution,
these estimates give results accuracte to one part in $10^{15}$ and $10^{17}$, respectively.

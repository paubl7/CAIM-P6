In a previous paper it was shown how to calculate the ground-state energy density $E$ and the $p$-point
Green's functions $G_p(x_1,x_2,...,x_p)$ for the $PT$-symmetric quantum field theory defined
by the Hamiltonian density $H=\frac{1}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2+\frac{1}{2}\phi^2(i\phi)^\varepsilon$
in $D$-dimensional Euclidean spacetime, where $\phi$ is a pseudoscalar field. In this earlier
paper $E$ and $G_p(x_1,x_2,...,x_p)$ were expressed as perturbation series in powers of $\varepsilon$
and were calculated to first order in $\varepsilon$. (The parameter $\varepsilon$ is a measure
of the nonlinearity of the interaction rather than a coupling constant.) This paper extends these
perturbative calculations to the Euclidean Lagrangian $L= \frac{1}{2}(\nabla\phi)^2+\frac{1}{2}\mu^2\phi^2+\frac{1}{2}
g\mu_0^2\phi^2\big(i\mu_0^{1-D/2}\phi\big)^\varepsilon-iv\phi$, which now includes renormalization
counterterms that are linear and quadratic in the field $\phi$. The parameter $g$ is a dimensionless
coupling strength and $\mu_0$ is a scaling factor having dimensions of mass. Expressions are given
for the one-, two, and three-point Green's functions, and the renormalized mass, to higher-order
in powers of $\varepsilon$ in $D$ dimensions ($0\leq D\leq2$). Renormalization is performed perturbatively
to second order in $\varepsilon$ and the structure of the Green's functions is analyzed in the limit
$D\to 2$. A sum of the most divergent terms is performed to {\it all} orders in $\varepsilon$. Like
the Cheng-Wu summation of leading logarithms in electrodynamics, it is found here that leading
logarithmic divergences combine to become mildly algebraic in form. Future work that must be done
to complete the perturbative renormalization procedure is discussed.

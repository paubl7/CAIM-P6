It has recently been proved that, in the presence of vortex flows, the fluctuation dynamics of a rotating
photon-fluid model is governed by the Klein-Gordon equation of an effective massive scalar field
in a $(2+1)$-dimensional acoustic black-hole spacetime. Interestingly, it has been demonstrated
numerically that the rotating acoustic black hole, like the familiar Kerr black-hole spacetime,
may support spatially regular stationary density fluctuations (linearized acoustic scalar `clouds')
in its exterior regions. In particular, it has been shown that the composed rotating-acoustic-black-hole-stationary-scalar-field
configurations of the photon-fluid model exist in the narrow dimensionless regime $\alpha\equiv\Omega_0/m\Omega_{\text{H}}\in(1,\alpha_{\text{max}})$
with $\alpha_{\text{max}}\simeq 1.08$ [here $\Omega_{\text{H}}$ is the angular velocity of
the black-hole horizon and $\{\Omega_0,m\}$ are respectively the effective proper mass and the
azimuthal harmonic index of the acoustic scalar field]. In the present paper we use analytical techniques
in order to explore the physical and mathematical properties of the acoustic scalar clouds of the
photon-fluid model in the regime $\Omega_{\text{H}}r_{\text{H}}\gg1$ of rapidly-spinning
central supporting acoustic black holes. In particular, we derive a remarkably compact analytical
formula for the discrete resonance spectrum $\{\Omega_0(\Omega_{\text{H}},m;n)\}$ which characterizes
the stationary bound-state acoustic scalar clouds of the photon-fluid model. Interestingly,
it is proved that the critical (maximal) mass parameter $\alpha_{\text{max}}$, which determines
the regime of existence of the composed acoustic-black-hole-stationary-bound-state-massive-scalar-field
configurations, is given by the exact dimensionless relation $\alpha_{\text{max}}=\sqrt{{{32}\over{27}}}$.

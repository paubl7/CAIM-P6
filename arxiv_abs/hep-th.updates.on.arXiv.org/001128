We investigate the asymptotic symmetry group of the free SU(N)-Yang-Mills theory using the Hamiltonian
formalism. We closely follow the strategy of Henneaux and Troessaert who successfully applied
the Hamiltonian formalism to the case of gravity and electrodynamics, thereby deriving the respective
asymptotic symmetry groups of these theories from clear-cut first principles. These principles
include the minimal assumptions that are necessary to ensure the existence of Hamiltonian structures
(phase space, symplectic form, differentiable Hamiltonian) and, in case of Poincar\'e invariant
theories, a canonical action of the Poincar\'e group. In the first part of the paper we show how these
requirements can be met in the non-abelian SU(N)-Yang-Mills case by imposing suitable fall-off
and parity conditions on the fields. We observe that these conditions admit neither non-trivial
asymptotic symmetries nor non-zero global charges. In the second part of the paper we discuss possible
gradual relaxations of these conditions by following the same strategy that Henneaux and Troessaert
had employed to remedy a similar situation in the electromagnetic case. Contrary to our expectation
and the findings of Henneaux and Troessaert for the abelian case, there seems to be no relaxation
that meets the requirements of a Hamiltonian formalism and allows for non-trivial asymptotic symmetries
and charges. Non-trivial asymptotic symmetries and charges are only possible if either the Poincar\'e
group fails to act canonically or if the formal expression for the symplectic form diverges, i.e.
the form does not exist. This seems to hint at a kind of colour-confinement built into the classical
Hamiltonian formulation of non-abelian gauge theories.

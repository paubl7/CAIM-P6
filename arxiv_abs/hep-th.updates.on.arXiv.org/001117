Applying recursive renormalization group transformations to a scalar field theory, we obtain
an effective quantum gravity theory with an emergent extra dimension, described by a dual holographic
Einstein-Klein-Gordon type action. Here, the dynamics of both the dual order-parameter field
and the metric tensor field originate from density-density and energy-momentum tensor-tensor
effective interactions, respectively, in the recursive renormalization group transformation,
performed approximately in the Gaussian level. This linear approximation in the recursive renormalization
group transformation for the gravity sector gives rise to a linearized quantum Einstein-scalar
theory along the $z-$directional emergent space. In the large $N$ limit, where $N$ is the flavor
number of the original scalar fields, quantum fluctuations of both dynamical metric and dual scalar
fields are suppressed, leading to a classical field theory of the Einstein-scalar type in $(D+1)$-spacetime
dimensions. We show that this emergent background gravity describes the renormalization group
flows of coupling functions in the UV quantum field theory through the extra dimension. More precisely,
the IR boundary conditions of the gravity equations correspond to the renormalization group $\beta$-functions
of the quantum field theory, where the infinitesimal distance in the extra-dimensional space is
identified with an energy scale for the renormalization group transformation. Finally, we also
show that this dual holographic formulation describes quantum entanglement in a geometrical way,
encoding the transfer of quantum entanglement from quantum matter to classical gravity in the large
$N$ limit. We claim that this entanglement transfer serves as a microscopic foundation for the emergent
holographic duality description.

We introduce a new microscopic quantity $\varepsilon $ that describes the contribution of a single
black hole molecule to black hole entropy and give a key relation that this microscopic quantity
is proportional to the macroscopic quantity -- entropy surface density $\sigma_{S}$, thus connecting
a microscopic quantity to a macroscopic quantity of black holes. Such a connection provides a new
probe for understanding the black hole microstructure from the macroscopic perspective. We also
classify black holes in terms of entropy surface density. When its entropy surface density is larger
(smaller) than $1/4$, this type of black holes is defined as strong (weak) Bekenstein-Hawking black
holes, where the black holes with $1/4$-entropy surface density are regarded as Bekenstein-Hawking
black holes. We compute the entropy surface density for four models, where three of them are regular
black holes -- the Bardeen black hole, the Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{\i}a black hole, and the Hayward
black hole, and one of them is a singular black hole -- the five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet
black hole. Under this scheme of classification, the Bardeen black hole, the Ay\'{o}n-Beato-Garc\'{\i}a
black hole, and the five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet black hole belong to the type of strong
Bekenstein-Hawking black holes, but the Hayward black hole belongs to the type of weak Bekenstein-Hawking
black holes, and the four black holes approach to the Bekenstein-Hawking black hole if their event
horizon radii go to infinity. In addition, we find interesting properties in phase transitions
from the viewpoint of entropy surface density, or equivalently from the viewpoint of a single black
hole molecule entropy, for the five-dimensional neutral Gauss-Bonnet AdS black hole.

We present a comprehensive analysis of supersymmetry anomalies in the free and massless Wess-Zumino
(WZ) model in perturbation theory. At the classical level the model possesses ${\mathcal N}=1$
superconformal symmetry, which is partially broken by quantum anomalies. The form of the anomalies
and the part of the symmetry they break depend on the multiplet of conserved currents used. It was
previously shown that the R-symmetry anomaly of the conformal current multiplet induces an anomaly
in Q-supersymmetry, which appears first in 4-point functions. Here we confirm this result by an
explicit 1-loop computation using a supersymmetric Pauli-Villars regulator. The conformal current
multiplet does not exist in the regulated theory because the regulator breaks conformal invariance,
R-symmetry and S-supersymmetry explicitly. The minimal massive multiplet is the Ferrara-Zumino
(FZ) one and the supersymmetry preserved by the regulator is a specific field dependent combination
of Q- and S- supersymmetry of the conformal multiplet. While this supersymmetry is non anomalous,
conformal invariance, R-symmetry and the original Q- and S-supersymmetries are explicitly broken
by finite contact terms (already at the level of 2-point functions), both in the regulated and renormalized
theories. A conformal current multiplet does exist for the renormalized theory and may be obtained
from the FZ multiplet by a set of finite local counterterms that eliminate the explicit symmetry
breaking, thus restoring superconformal invariance up to anomalies. However, this necessarily
renders both Q- and S-supersymmetries anomalous, as is manifest starting at 4-point functions
of conformal multiplet currents. The paper contains a detailed discussion of a number of issues
and subtleties related to Ward identities that may be useful in a wider context.

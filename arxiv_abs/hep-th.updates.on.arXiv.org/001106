So far none of attempts to quantize gravity has led to a satisfactory model that not only describe
gravity in the realm of a quantum world, but also its relation to elementary particles and other fundamental
forces. Here we outline preliminary results for a model of quantum universe, in which gravity is
fundamentally and by construction quantic. The model is based on 3 well motivated assumptions with
compelling observational and theoretical evidence: quantum mechanics is valid at all scales;
quantum systems are described by their symmetries; Universe has infinite independent degrees
of freedom. The last assumption means that the Hilbert space of the Universe has $SU(N\rightarrow
\infty) \cong \text{area preserving Diff.} (S_2)$ symmetry, which is parameterized by two angular
variables. We show that in absence of a background spacetime, this Universe is trivial and static.
Nonetheless, quantum fluctuations break the symmetry and divide the Universe to subsystems. When
a subsystem is singled out as reference - {\it observer} - and another as {\it clock}, two more continuous
parameters arise, which can be interpreted as distance and time. We identify the classical spacetime
with parameter space of the Hilbert space of the Universe. Therefore, its quantization is meaningless.
In this view, the Einstein equation presents the projection of quantum dynamics in the Hilbert space
into its parameter space. Finite dimensional symmetries of elementary particles emerge as a consequence
of symmetry breaking when the Universe is divided to subsystems/particles without having any implication
for the infinite dimensional symmetry and its associated interaction percived as gravity. This
explains why gravity is a universal force.

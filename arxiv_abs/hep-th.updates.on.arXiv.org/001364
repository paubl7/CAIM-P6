We analyze the relevance of the generalized Kronheimer construction for the gauge-gravity correspondence.
We study the general structure of IIB supergravity D3-brane solutions on crepant resolutions $Y$
of singularities $\mathbb{C}^3/\Gamma$ with $\Gamma$ a finite subgroup of $SU(3)$. Next we concentrate
on another essential item for the D3-brane construction, i.e., the existence of a Ricci-flat metric
on $Y$, with particular attention to the case $\Gamma=\mathbb{Z}_4$. We conjecture that on the
exceptional divisor the Kronheimer K\"ahler metric and the Ricci-flat one, that is locally flat
at infinity, coincide. The conjecture is shown to be true in the case of the Ricci-flat metric on ${\rm
tot} K_{{\mathbb WP}[112]}$ that we construct, which is a partial resolution of $\mathbb{C}^3/\mathbb{Z}_4$.
For the full resolution we have $Y=\operatorname{tot} K_{\mathbb{F}_{2}}$, where $\mathbb{F}_2$
is the second Hizebruch surface. We try to extend the proof of the conjecture to this case using the
one-parameter K\"ahler metric on $\mathbb{F}_2$ produced by the Kronheimer construction as initial
datum in a Monge-Amp\`{e}re (MA) equation. We exhibit three formulations of this MA equation, one
in terms of the K\"ahler potential, the other two in terms of the symplectic potential; in all cases
one can establish a series solution in powers of the fiber variable of the canonical bundle. The main
property of the MA equation is that it does not impose any condition on the initial geometry of the
exceptional divisor, but uniquely determines all the subsequent terms as local functionals of
the initial datum. While a formal proof is still missing, numerical and analytical results support
the conjecture. As a by-product of our investigation we have identified some new properties of this
type of MA equations that we believe to be so far unknown.

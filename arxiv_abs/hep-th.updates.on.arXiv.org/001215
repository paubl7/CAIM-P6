According to the 't Hooft-Susskind holography, the black hole entropy,$S_\mathrm{BH}$, is carried
by the chaotic microscopic degrees of freedom, which live in the near horizon region and have a Hilbert
space of states of finite dimension $d=\exp(S_\mathrm{BH})$. In previous work we have proposed
that the near horizon geometry, when the microscopic degrees of freedom can be resolved, can be described
by the AdS$_2[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ discrete, finite and random geometry, where $N\propto S_\mathrm{BH}$.
It has been constructed by purely arithmetic and group theoretical methods in order to explain,
in a direct way, the finiteness of the entropy, $S_\mathrm{BH}$. What has been left as an open problem
is how the smooth AdS$_2$ geometry can be recovered, in the limit when $N\to\infty$. In the present
article we solve this problem, by showing that the discrete and finite AdS$_2[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ geometry
can be embedded in a family of finite geometries, AdS$_2^M[\mathbb{Z}_N]$, where $M$ is another
integer. This family can be constructed by an appropriate toroidal compactification and discretization
of the ambient $(2+1)$-dimensional Minkowski space-time. In this construction $N$ and $M$ can
be understood as "infrared" and "ultraviolet" cutoffs respectively. The above construction enables
us to obtain the continuum limit of the AdS$_2^M[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ discrete and finite geometry,
by taking both $N$ and $M$ to infinity in a specific correlated way, following a reverse process:
Firstly, by recovering the continuous, toroidally compactified, AdS$_2[\mathbb{Z}_N]$ geometry
by removing the ultraviolet cutoff; secondly, by removing the infrared cutoff in a specific decompactification
limit, while keeping the radius of AdS$_2$ finite. It is in this way that we recover the standard non-compact
AdS$_2$ continuum space-time. This method can be applied directly to higher-dimensional AdS spacetimes.

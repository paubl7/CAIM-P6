The Yang-Mills theory is part of the Standard Model of particle physics. The lack of the mathematical
understanding of the theory stands out in theoretical physics. In order to address this problem
we observe that a recently proposed general model beyond the Standard Model resolves the energy
scales of a lattice regularized Yang-Mills theory by means of an extra dimension. The extra dimension
ensures that all intermediate length scales of the physical system are available by definition.
In this paper we study the role of the extra dimension also in the case of the free boson field. We find
that if the extra dimension size is large, the model describes the classical motion of the system.
In the opposite limit we recover its standard quantum mechanical motion without loss of information.
Therefore, the Hilbert space of states in the presence of the extra dimension describes physical
phenomena at all energy scales. This observation allows us to raise the description of length scales
by an extra dimension at the level of a principle for the theories beyond the Standard Model, the only
modeling constraint being the correspondence principle. As it was shown recently, the fermion
ground state energy of a gauge invariant Hamilton operator of Dirac fermions gives a particular
lattice regularization of the Yang-Mills theory. Integration of gauge fields gives a pure fermion
theory of color singlet fermion-antifermion pairs at each lattice site evolving along the extra
dimension. Color confinement follows directly from this property. It allows for a saddle point
solution in the limit of a large number of colors. In this paper we find that the glueball spectrum
of the Yang-Mills regularized theory is of the Hagedron type and bounded below by a positive value.
We show also that the color charge is screened and the quark-antiquark potential is constant.

We revise the steady vortex surface theory following the recent finding of asymmetric vortex sheets
(AM,2021). These surfaces avoid the \KH{} instability by adjusting their discontinuity and shape.
The vorticity collapses to the sheet only in an exceptional case considered long ago by Burgers and
Townsend, where it decays as a Gaussian on both sides of the sheet. In generic asymmetric vortex sheets
(Shariff,2021), vorticity leaks to one side or another, making such sheets inadequate for vortex
sheet statistics and anomalous dissipation. We conjecture that the vorticity in a turbulent flow
collapses on the special kind of surface. The eigenvalue of the strain tensor along the velocity
gap vanishes at this surface. In this case, the Euler vortex sheet solution matches the planar Burgers-Townsend
solution of the Navier-Stokes equation in the local boundary layer; otherwise, it matches the asymmetric
vortex sheet solution which leaks vorticity. The most important qualitative observation is that
the inequality needed for this solution's stability breaks the Euler dynamics' time reversibility.
We interpret this as dynamic irreversibility. We have also represented the enstrophy by a surface
integral, conserved in the vortex sheet dynamics in the turbulent limit. We have found the exact
analytic solution for the cylindrical vortex surface for an arbitrary constant background strain
with two different eigenvalues. This solution is expressed as parametric representation using
two conformal maps: from the unit circle into the $x + \i y$ complex plane and into velocity field $v_x
- \i v_y$. We represent these conformal maps as integrals of certain algebraic functions over the
unit circle. We have investigated this solution numerically in great detail. In the next paper extending
this one, we study turbulent statistics corresponding to this family of steady solutions.

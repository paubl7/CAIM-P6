Directing a jet of humid air to impinge on a surface that is cooled below the dew point results in micro-sized
water droplets. Lord Rayleigh discussed the phenomenon called such behavior Breath Figures (BF).
Historically, utilizing dew as a water source was investigated by several scientists dating back
to Aristotle. However, due to the degrading effects of air as a non-condensable gas (NCG) such efforts
are limited to small scale water production systems. Recently, the concept of BF has been utilized
extensively in the generation of micro-scale polymer patterns as a self-assembly process. However,
the generation of BF on surfaces while being impinged by a humid air jet has not been quantified. In
this work, we illustrate that a BF spot generated on a cooled surface is a manifestation of a recovery
concentration. The concept is analogous to the concept of adiabatic-wall temperature defined
for heat transfer applications. Upon closer examination of the vapor concentration distribution
on a cooled impinged surface, we found that the distribution exhibits distinct regimes depending
on the radial location from the center of the impingement region. The first regime is confined within
the impingement region, whereas the second regime lies beyond this radial location including the
wall jet region. Scaling analysis as well as numerical solution of the former regime shows that the
maximum concentration on the surface is equivalent to its counterpart of a free unbounded jet with
similar geometrical conditions. Additionally, the scaling analysis of the latter regime reveals
that the jet speed and standoff distance are not important in determining the recovery concentration.
However, the recovery concentration is found to vary monotonically with the radial location. Our
conclusions are of great importance in optimizing jet impingement where condensation phase change
is prevalent.

Objective: Radiation therapy treatment planning is a time-consuming, iterative process with
potentially high inter-planner variability. Fully automated treatment planning processes could
reduce a planner's active treatment planning time and remove inter-planner variability, with
the potential to tremendously improve patient turnover and quality of care. In developing fully
automated algorithms for treatment planning, we have two main objectives: to produce plans that
are 1) Pareto optimal and 2) clinically acceptable. Here, we propose the Pareto optimal projection
search (POPS) algorithm, which provides a general framework for directly searching the Pareto
front. Methods: Our POPS algorithm is a novel automated planning method that combines two main search
processes: 1) gradient-free search in the decision variable space and 2) projection of decision
variables to the Pareto front using the bisection method. We demonstrate the performance of POPS
by comparing with clinical treatment plans. As one possible quantitative measure of treatment
plan quality, we construct a clinical acceptability scoring function (SF) modified from the previously
developed general evaluation metric (GEM). Results: On a dataset of 21 prostate cases collected
as part of clinical workflow, our proposed POPS algorithm produces Pareto optimal plans that are
clinically acceptable in regards to dose conformity, dose homogeneity, and sparing of organs-at-risk.
Conclusion: Our proposed POPS algorithm provides a general framework for fully automated treatment
planning that achieves clinically acceptable dosimetric quality without requiring active planning
from human planners. Significance: Our fully automated POPS algorithm addresses many key limitations
of other automated planning approaches, and we anticipate that it will substantially improve treatment
planning workflow.

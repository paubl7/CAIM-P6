Effective organismal behavior responds appropriately to changes in the surrounding environment.
Attaining this delicate balance of sensitivity and stability is a hallmark of the animal kingdom.
By studying the locomotory behavior of a simple animal (\textit{Trichoplax adhaerens}) without
muscles or neurons, here, we demonstrate how monociliated epithelial cells work collectively
to give rise to an agile non-neuromuscular organism. Via direct visualization of large ciliary
arrays, we report the discovery of sub-second ciliary reorientations under a rotational torque
that is mediated by collective tissue mechanics and the adhesion of cilia to the underlying substrate.
In a toy model, we show a mapping of this system onto an "active-elastic resonator". This framework
explains how perturbations propagate information in this array as linear speed traveling waves
in response to mechanical stimulus. Next, we explore the implications of parametric driving in
this active-elastic resonator and show that such driving can excite mechanical 'spikes'. These
spikes in collective mode amplitudes are consistent with a system driven by parametric amplification
and a saturating nonlinearity. We conduct extensive numerical experiments to corroborate these
findings within a polarized active-elastic sheet. These results indicate that periodic and stochastic
forcing are valuable for increasing the sensitivity of collective ciliary flocking. We support
these theoretical predictions via direct experimental observation of linear speed traveling
waves which arise from the hybridization of spin and overdamped density waves. We map how these ciliary
flocking dynamics result in agile motility via coupling between an amplified resonator and a tuning
(Goldstone-like) mode of the system. This sets the stage for how activity and elasticity can self-organize
into behavior which benefits the organism as a whole.

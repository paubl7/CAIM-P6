Advanced thermodynamic equilibrium computations are required to model the phase behavior in the
numerical simulation of thermal recovery processes. Such phase behavior models rely on compositional
descriptions of the oil using up to tens of components to obtain accurate solutions. Lumping a large
number of components into a smaller number of pseudo-components in order to reduce the computational
cost is standard practice for thermal simulations. However, the impact the lumping process has
on the displacement processes can be hard to estimate a priori. Thermal, compositional and reactive
simulations such as In-Situ Combustion (ISC) exhibit a tight coupling between mass and energy conservation,
through phase behavior, heat transport and reactions. We observe that depending on the number and
type of lumped pseudo-components retained in the simulation, the results can exhibit modeling
artefacts and/or fail to capture the relevant displacement processes. We illustrate that for several
thermal hot gas injection processes, with and without reactions, the displacement results using
a small number of pseudo-components do not capture the physical phenomena. Lumping heavy components
together overestimates the size of the oil banks and gives inaccurate speeds for multiple fronts.
Then, we consider the effects of different compositional interpretations of the lumped pseudo-species
appearing in typical reaction schemes. Due to compositional effects, they strongly impact the
behavior of the solutions through the intricate interplay between reactions, phase behavior and
displacement effects. We allow a constant, mass-based fraction of the oil to react and modify which
components are reactants. Due to molecular weight effects, the reaction rate is larger when light
and medium components are allowed to react. In those cases, the fronts are faster and the oil banks
bigger due to the increased displacement.

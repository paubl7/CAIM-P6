The radiance of thermal emission, as described by Planck law, depends only on the emissivity and
temperature of a body, and increases monotonically with the temperature rise at any emitted wavelength.
Nonthermal radiation, such as photoluminescence, is a fundamental light matter interaction that
conventionally involves the absorption of an energetic photon, thermalization, and the emission
of a redshifted photon. Such a quantum process is governed by rate conservation, which is contingent
on the quantum efficiency. In the past, the role of rate conservation for significant thermal excitation
had not been studied. Recently, we presented the theory and an experimental demonstration that
showed, in contrast to thermal emission, that the PL rate is conserved when the temperature increases
while each photon is blueshifted. A further rise in temperature leads to an abrupt transition to
thermal emission where the photon rate increases sharply. We also demonstrated how such thermally
enhanced PL, TEPL, generates orders of magnitude more energetic photons than thermal emission
at similar temperatures. These findings show that TEPL is an ideal optical heat pump that can harvest
thermal losses in photovoltaics with a maximal theoretical efficiency of 70%, and practical concepts
potentially reaching 45% efficiency. Here we move the TEPL concept onto the engineering level and
present Cr:Nd:YAG as device grade PL material, absorbing solar radiation up to 1 micrometer wavelength
and heated by thermalization of energetic photons. Its blueshifted emission, which can match GaAs
cells, is 20% of the absorbed power. Based on a detailed balance simulation, such a material coupled
with proper photonic management can reach 34% power conversion efficiency. These results raise
confidence in the potential of TEPL becoming a disruptive technology in photovoltaics.

As the photovoltaic sector approaches 1 TW in cumulative installed capacity, we provide an overview
of the current challenges to achieve further technological improvements. On the raw materials
side, we see no fundamental limitation to expansion in capacity of the current market technologies,
even though basic estimates predict that the PV sector will become the largest consumer of Ag in the
world after 2030. On the other hand, recent market data on PV costs indicates that the largest cost
fraction is now infrastructure and area-related, and nearly independent of the core cell technology.
Therefore, additional value adding is likely to proceed via an increase in energy yield metrics
such as the power density and/or efficiency of the PV module. However, current market technologies
are near their fundamental detailed balance efficiency limits. The transition to multijunction
PV in tandem configurations is regarded as the most promising path to surpass this limitation and
increase the power per unit area of PV modules. So far, each specific multijunction concept faces
particular obstacles that have prevented their upscaling, but the field is rapidly improving.
In this review work, we provide a global comparison between the different types of multijunction
concepts, including III-Vs, Si-based tandems and the emergence of perovskite/Si devices. Coupled
with analyses of new notable developments in the field, we discuss the challenges common to different
multijunction cell architectures, and the specific challenges of each type of device, both on a
cell level and on a module integration level. From the analysis, we conclude that several tandem
concepts are nearing the disruption level where a breakthrough into mainstream PV is possible.

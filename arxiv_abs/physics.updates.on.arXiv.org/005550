Knowledge of x-ray attenuation is essential for developing and evaluating x-ray imaging technologies.
For instance, techniques to distinguish between cysts and solid tumours at mammography screening
would be highly desirable to reduce recalls, but the development requires knowledge of the x-ray
attenuation for cysts and tumours. We have previously measured the attenuation of cyst fluid using
photon-counting spectral mammography. Data on x-ray attenuation for solid breast lesions are
available in the literature, but cover a relatively wide range, likely caused by natural spread
between samples, random measurement errors, and different experimental conditions. In this study,
we have adapted the previously developed spectral method to measure the linear attenuation of solid
breast lesions. A total of 56 malignant and 5 benign lesions were included in the study. The samples
were placed in a holder that allowed for thickness measurement. Spectral (energy-resolved) images
of the samples were acquired and the image signal was mapped to equivalent thicknesses of two known
reference materials, which can be used to derive the x-ray attenuation as a function of energy. The
spread in equivalent material thicknesses was relatively large between samples, which is likely
to be caused mainly by natural variation and only to a minor extent by random measurement errors and
sample inhomogeneity. No significant difference in attenuation was found between benign and malignant
solid lesions, or between different types of malignant lesions. The separation between cyst-fluid
and tumour attenuation was, however, significant, which suggests it may be possible to distinguish
cystic from solid breast lesions, and the results lay the groundwork for a clinical trial. [cropped]

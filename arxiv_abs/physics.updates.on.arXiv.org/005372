The transport of lymph through the lymphatic vasculature is the mechanism for returning excess
interstitial fluid to the circulatory system, and it is essential for fluid homeostasis. Collecting
lymphatic vessels comprise a significant portion of the lymphatic vasculature and are divided
by valves into contractile segments known as lymphangions. Despite its importance, lymphatic
transport in collecting vessels is not well understood. We present a computational model to study
lymph flow through chains of valved, contracting lymphangions. We used the Navier-Stokes equations
to model the fluid flow and the immersed boundary method to handle the two-way, fluid-structure
interaction. We used our model to evaluate the effects of chain length, contraction style, and adverse
axial pressure difference on cycle-mean flow rates (CMFRs). In the model, longer lymphangion chains
generally yield larger CMFRs, and they fail to generate positive CMFRs at higher adverse pressure
differences than shorter chains. Simultaneously contracting pumps generate the largest CMFRs
at nearly every adverse pressure difference and for every chain length. Due to the contraction timing
and valve dynamics, non-simultaneous pumps generate lower CMFRs than the simultaneous pumps;
the discrepancy diminishes as the adverse pressure difference increases. Valve dynamics vary
with the contraction style and exhibit hysteretic opening and closing behaviors. Interior-valve
closure occurs only in the non-simultaneous pumps. In all pumps, the outlet valve remains shut throughout
a contraction cycle when the adverse pressure difference is sufficiently large. Our model provides
insight into how contraction propagation affects flow rates and transport through a lymphangion
chain.

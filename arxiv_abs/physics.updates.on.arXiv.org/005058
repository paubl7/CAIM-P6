Objective: Many recent studies have suggested that brain deformation resulting from a head impact
is linked to the corresponding clinical outcome, such as mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI). Even
though several finite element (FE) head models have been developed and validated to calculate brain
deformation based on impact kinematics, the clinical application of these FE head models is limited
due to the time-consuming nature of FE simulations. This work aims to accelerate the process of brain
deformation calculation and thus improve the potential for clinical applications. Methods: We
propose a deep learning head model with a five-layer deep neural network and feature engineering,
and trained and tested the model on 1803 total head impacts from a combination of head model simulations
and on-field college football and mixed martial arts impacts. Results: The proposed deep learning
head model can calculate the maximum principal strain for every element in the entire brain in less
than 0.001s (with an average root mean squared error of 0.025, and with a standard deviation of 0.002
over twenty repeats with random data partition and model initialization). The contributions of
various features to the predictive power of the model were investigated, and it was noted that the
features based on angular acceleration were found to be more predictive than the features based
on angular velocity. Conclusion: Trained using the dataset of 1803 head impacts, this model can
be applied to various sports in the calculation of brain strain with accuracy, and its applicability
can even further be extended by incorporating data from other types of head impacts. Significance:
In addition to the potential clinical application in real-time brain deformation monitoring,
this model will help researchers estimate the brain strain from a large number of head impacts more
efficiently than using FE models.

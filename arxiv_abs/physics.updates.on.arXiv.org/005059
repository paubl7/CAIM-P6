Computationally hard problems, including combinatorial optimization, can be mapped into the
problem of finding the ground-state of an Ising Hamiltonian. Building physical systems with collective
computational ability and distributed parallel processing capability can accelerate the ground-state
search. Here, we present a continuous-time dynamical system (CTDS) approach where the ground-state
solution appears as stable points or attractor states of the CTDS. We harness the emergent dynamics
of a network of phase-transition nano-oscillators (PTNO) to build an Ising Hamiltonian solver.
The hardware fabric comprises of electrically coupled injection-locked stochastic PTNOs with
bi-stable phases emulating artificial Ising spins. We demonstrate the ability of the stochastic
PTNO-CTDS to progressively find more optimal solution by increasing the strength of the injection-locking
signal - akin to performing classical annealing. We demonstrate in silico that the PTNO-CTDS prototype
solves a benchmark non-deterministic polynomial time (NP)-hard Max-Cut problem with high probability
of success. Using experimentally calibrated numerical simulations, we investigate the performance
of the hardware with increasing problem size. We show the best-in-class energy-efficiency of 3.26x10^7
solutions/sec/Watt which translates to over five orders of magnitude improvement when compared
with digital CMOS, quantum and photonic Ising solver approaches. We also demonstrate an order of
magnitude improvement over a discrete-time memristor-based Hopfield network approach. Such
an energy efficient CTDS hardware exhibiting high solution-throughput/Watt can find application
in industrial planning and manufacturing, defense and cyber-security, bioinformatics and drug
discovery.

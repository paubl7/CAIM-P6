Peripheral Nerve Stimulation (PNS) constrains the clinical performance of Magnetic Resonance
and Particle Imaging (MRI and MPI) systems. Extensive magneto-stimulation studies have been carried
out recently in the field of MPI, where typical operation frequencies range from single to tens of
kilo-hertz. PNS literature is scarce for MRI in this regime, where the resonant character of MPI
coils prevents studies of broad-band excitation pulses. We have constructed an apparatus for PNS
threshold determination on a subject's limb, capable of narrow and broad-band magnetic excitation
with pulse characteristic times down to 40 us. From a first set of measurements on 51 volunteers,
we observe that PNS limits coincide for sinusoidal (biphasic narrow-band) and triangular (biphasic
broad-band) excitations, and are slightly lower for trapezoidal (monophasic broad-band) pulses.
We have also measured statistically significant correlations of PNS sensitivity with arm size
and body weight, and no correlation with height or gender. As opposed to resonant systems, our setup
allows the execution of arbitrarily short pulse trains. We have confirmed thresholds increase
significantly as trains transition from tens to a few pulses also in these fast timescales. By changing
the polarity of the coils in our setup, we also looked at the influence of the spatial distribution
of magnetic field strength on PNS effects. We find that thresholds are higher in an approximately
linearly inhomogeneous field (relevant to MRI) than in a rather homogeneous distribution (as in
MPI). Finally, given the large intersubject variability of PNS sensitivity, we propose employing
a versatile low-cost system (such as presented here) for fast offline determination of a subject's
limits prior to medical scanning, and then using this information to boost clinical imaging while
preserving the patient's safety.

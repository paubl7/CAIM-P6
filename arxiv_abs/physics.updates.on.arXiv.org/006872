In this paper, we report on the photon emission of Silicon Photomultipliers (SiPMs) from avalanche
pulses generated in dark condition, with the main objective of better understanding the associated
systematics for next-generation, large area, SiPM-based physics experiments. A new apparatus
for spectral and imaging analysis was developed at TRIUMF and used to measure the light emitted by
two SiPMs considered as photo-sensor candidates for the nEXO neutrinoless double-beta decay experiment:
one Fondazione Bruno Kessler (FBK) VUV-HD Low Field (LF) Low After Pulse (Low AP) (VUV-HD3) SiPM,
and one Hamamatsu Photonics K.K. (HPK) VUV4 Multi-Pixel Photon Counter (MPPC). Spectral measurements
of their light emission were taken with varying over-voltage in the wavelength range of 450--1020\,nm.
For the FBK VUV-HD3, at an over-voltage of $12.1\pm1.0$\,V, we measure a secondary photon yield
(number of photons ($\gamma$) emitted per charge carrier ($e^{-}$)) of $(4.04\pm0.02)\times
10^{-6}$ $\gamma/e^{-}$. The emission spectrum of the FBK VUV-HD3 contains an interference pattern
consistent with thin-film interference. Additionally, emission microscopy images (EMMIs) of
the FBK VUV-HD3 show a small number of highly localized regions with increased light intensity (hotspots)
randomly distributed over the SiPM surface area. For the HPK VUV4 MPPC, at an over-voltage of $10.7\pm1.0$\,V,
we measure a secondary photon yield of $(8.71\pm0.04)\times 10^{-6}$ $\gamma/e^{-}$. In contrast
to the FBK VUV-HD3, the emission spectra of the HPK VUV4 don't show an interference pattern---most
likely due to a thinner surface coating. EMMIs of the HPK VUV4 also reveal a larger number of hotspots
compared to the FBK VUV-HD3, especially in one of the corners of the device.

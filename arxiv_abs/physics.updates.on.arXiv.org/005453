Hydraulic jumps occur commonly in natural channels and energy dissipation systems of hydraulic
structures in the violent transition from supercritical to subcritical flows. They are characterised
by large flow aeration, high turbulence and strong fluctuations of the free surface and the jump
toe. For free surface measurements, fast-sampling, fixed-point instruments such as acoustic
displacement meters (ADMs) and wire gauges (WGs) are commonly used, while LIDAR technology is a
relatively new method for recording instantaneous free surface motions of aerated flows. While
each of these instruments has been shown previously to provide reasonable results for basic and
advanced free surface properties, differences between instruments and experiments remain unexplained.
To systematically analyse these differences, simultaneous laboratory experiments of aerated
hydraulic jumps were conducted. Good agreement between the three instruments was obtained for
basic free surface properties including elevations, fluctuations, skewness, kurtosis, and frequencies,
as well as advanced free surface properties such as integral time and length scales. These new results
indicate that any of these instruments can be used for the recording of free surface properties albeit
the integration limit for free surface scales must be considered. A key finding of this research
was that differences between repeated experiments as well as previous studies were observed when
using the visual jump toe for alignment. However, this bias could be resolved by using the mean jump
toe location recorded with the LIDAR. Therefore, future studies should simultaneously measure
the instantaneous jump toe to provide more consistent results across studies.

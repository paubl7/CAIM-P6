Accurate estimates of historical changes in sea surface temperatures (SSTs) and their uncertainties
are important for documenting and understanding historical changes in climate. A source of uncertainty
that has not previously been quantified in historical SST estimates stems from position errors.
A Bayesian inference framework is proposed for quantifying errors in reported positions and their
implications on SST estimates. The analysis framework is applied to data from the International
Comprehensive Ocean-Atmosphere Data Set (ICOADS3.0) in 1885, a time when astronomical and chronometer
estimation of position was common, but predating the use of radio signals. Focus is upon a subset
of 943 ship tracks from ICOADS3.0 that report their position every two hours to a precision of 0.01{\deg}
longitude and latitude. These data are interpreted as positions determined by dead reckoning that
are periodically updated by celestial correction techniques. The posterior medians of uncertainties
in celestial correction are 33.1 km (0.30{\deg} on the equator) in longitude and 24.4 km (0.22{\deg})
in latitude, respectively. The posterior medians of two-hourly dead reckoning uncertainties
are 19.2% for ship speed and 13.2{\deg} for ship heading, leading to random position uncertainties
with median 0.18{\deg} (20 km on the equator) in longitude and 0.15{\deg} (17 km) in latitude. Reported
ship tracks also contain systematic position uncertainties relating to precursor dead-reckoning
positions not being updated after obtaining celestial position estimates, indicating that more
accurate positions can be provided for SST observations. Finally, we translate position errors
into SST uncertainties by sampling an ensemble of SSTs from the Multi-scale Ultra-high resolution
Sea Surface Temperature (MURSST) data set.

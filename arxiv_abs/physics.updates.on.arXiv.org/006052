The Arecibo Observatory (AO) is a multidisciplinary research and education facility that is recognized
worldwide as a leading facility in astronomy, planetary, and atmospheric and space sciences. AO's
cornerstone research instrument was the 305-m William E. Gordon telescope. On December 1, 2020,
the 305-m telescope collapsed and was irreparably damaged. In the three weeks following the collapse,
AO's scientific and engineering staff and the AO users community initiated extensive discussions
on the future of the observatory. The community is in overwhelming agreement that there is a need
to build an enhanced, next-generation radar-radio telescope at the AO site. From these discussions,
we established the set of science requirements the new facility should enable. These requirements
can be summarized briefly as: 5 MW of continuous wave transmitter power at 2 - 6 GHz, 10 MW of peak transmitter
power at 430 MHz (also at 220MHz under consideration), zenith angle coverage 0 to 48 deg, frequency
coverage 0.2 to 30 GHz and increased Field-of-View. These requirements determine the unique specifications
of the proposed new instrument. The telescope design concept we suggest consists of a compact array
of fixed dishes on a tiltable, plate-like structure with a collecting area equivalent to a 300m dish.
This concept, referred to as the Next Generation Arecibo Telescope (NGAT), meets all of the desired
specifications and provides significant new science capabilities to all three research groups
at AO. This whitepaper presents a sample of the wide variety of the science that can be achieved with
the NGAT, the details of the telescope design concept and the need for the new telescope to be located
at the AO site. We also discuss other AO science activities that interlock with the NGAT in the white
paper.

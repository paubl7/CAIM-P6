This study introduces the HYPERSCINT research platform, the first commercially available scintillation
dosimetry platform capable of multi-point dosimetry through the hyperspectral approach. Optic
and dosimetric performances of the system were investigated through comparison with another commercially
available solution, the Ocean Optics QE65Pro spectrometer. The optical characterization was
accomplished by measuring the linearity of the signal as a function of integration time, photon
detection efficiency and spectral resolution for both systems under the same conditions. Dosimetric
performances were then evaluated with a 3-point plastic scintillator detector (mPSD) in terms
of signal to noise ratio (SNR) and signal to background ratio (SBR) associated to each scintillator.
The latter were subsequently compared with those found in the literature for the Exradin W1, a single-point
plastic scintillator detector. Finally, various beam measurements were realized with the HYPERSCINT
platform to evaluate its ability to perform clinical photon beam dosimetry. Although the QE65Pro
possess a higher spectral resolution, this study demonstrates that the sensitivity of the HYPERSCINT
is up to 10 time greater, surpassing even the SNR of the Exradin W1 single-point PSD. While the doses
ranging from 1 cGy to 600 cGy were accurately measured within 2.1% of the predicted dose using the
HYPERSCINT platform coupled to the mPSD, the Ocean optics spectrometer shows discrepencies up
to 86% under 50 cGy. Similarly, depth dose, Full-Width-Half-Max region of the beam profile and output
factors were all accurately measured within 2.3% of the predicted dose using the HYPERSCINT platform
and exhibit an average difference of 0.5%, 1.6% and 0.6%, respectively.

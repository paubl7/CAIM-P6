A study of a reacting boundary layer flow with heat transfer at conditions typical for configurations
at elevated pressures has been performed using a set of direct numerical simulations. Effects of
wall temperatures are investigated, representative for cooled walls of gas turbines and sub-scale
rocket engines operating with hydrocarbon as fuels. The results show that exothermic chemical
reactions induced by the low-enthalpy in the boundary layer take place predominantly in the logarthimic
sub-layer. The majority of the heat release is attributed to the exothermic recombination of OH
and CO to produce CO2 and H2O. The recombination reactions result in an increase of the wall heat loads
by up to 20% compared to the inert flow. The gas composition experiences strong deviations from the
chemical equilibrium conditions. In fact, a quenching of the major species is observed within the
viscous sub-layer and the transition region. Analysis of chemical time-scales shows that the location
of quenched composition coincides with the region where the Damkoehler number decreases below
unity. Within the viscous sub-layer, a secondary reaction zone is detected, involving the production
of formyl and formaldehyde radicals that provide an additional source of energy release. The analysis
of the reaction paths showed that reactions with zero activation energy are responsible for this
change in gas composition, which also account for the initial branching of hydrocarbon fuels decomposition
according to previous auto-ignition studies. The effect of the secondary recombination reactions
is more prominent for the lower wall temperature case. Finally, the role of turbulent fluctuations
on the species net chemical production rates is evaluated, showing a strong correlation between
species and temperature fluctuations.

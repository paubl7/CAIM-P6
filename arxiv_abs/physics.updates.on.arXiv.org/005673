The present study primarily focuses on the effect of jet spacing and strut geometry on the evolution
and structure of the large-scale vortices which play a key role in mixing characteristics in turbulent
supersonic flows. Numerically simulated results corresponding to varying parameters such as
strut geometry and jet spacing (Xn=nDj such that n=2, 3 & 5) for square jet of height Dj=0.6 mm is presented
in the current study, while the work also investigates the presence of the local quasi-two-dimensionality
for the X2(2Dj) jet spacing; however, the same is not true for higher jet spacing. Further, the tapered
strut (TS) section is modified to the straight strut (SS) for investigation, where the remarkable
difference in flow physics is unfolded between the two configurations for similar jet spacing (X2:
2Dj). The instantaneous density and vorticity contours reveal the structures of varying scales
undergoing different evolution for the different configurations. The effect of local spanwise
rollers is clearly manifested in the mixing efficiency and the jet spreading rate. SS configuration
exhibits excellent near field mixing behavior amongst all the arrangements. However, in case of
TS cases, only X2(2Dj) configuration performs better due to the presence of local spanwise rollers.
The qualitative and quantitative analysis reveals that near-field mixing is strongly affected
by the two-dimensional rollers, while the early onset of wake mode is another crucial parameter
to have improved mixing. Modal decomposition performed for SS arrangement sheds light into the
spatial and temporal coherence of the structures, where the most dominant structures are found
to be the Von-Karman street vortices in the wake region.

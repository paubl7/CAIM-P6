In this paper we present a novel hydrodynamic experiment using liquid $^4$He. The flow is forced
inertially by a canonical oscillating grid using either its normal (He~I) or superfluid (He~II)
phase, generating a statistically stationary turbulence. We characterise the turbulent properties
of the flow using 2D Lagrangian Particle tracking on hollow glass micro-spheres. As expected for
tracer particles, the Vorono\"{i} tessellation on particle positions does not show a significant
departure from a random Poisson process neither in He~I nor He~II phase. Particles' positions are
tracked with high temporal resolution, allowing to resolve velocity fluctuations at integral
and inertial scales while properly assessing the noise contribution. Additionally, we differentiate
the particles' positions (by convolution with Gaussian kernels) in order to access small scale
quantities like acceleration. Using these measured quantities and the formalism of classical
Homogeneous Isotropic Turbulence (HIT) to perform an energy budget across scales we extract the
energy injection rate at the large scale, the energy flux cascading through inertial scales, down
to small scales at which it is dissipated. We found that in such inertially driven turbulence, regardless
of the normal or superfluid state of the fluid, estimates of energy at the different scales are compatible
with each other and consistent with oscillating grid turbulence results reported for normal fluids
in the literature. The largest discrepancy shows up at small scales where the signal to noise ratio
is harder to control and where the 2D measurement is contaminated by the 3D nature of the flow. This
motivates to focus future experimental projects towards small scales, low noise and 3D measurements.

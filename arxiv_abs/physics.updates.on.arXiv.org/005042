Manganese oxides have received much attention over the years among the wide range of electrocatalysts
for the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) due to their low toxicity, high abundance and rich redox
chemistry. While many previous studies focused on the activity of these materials, a better understanding
of the material transformations relating to activation or degradation is highly desirable, both
from a scientific perspective and for applications. We electrodeposited Na-containing MnOx without
long-range order from an alkaline solution to investigate these aspects by cyclic voltammetry,
scanning electron microscopy and x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Mn-K and Mn-L edges. The
pristine film was assigned to a layered edge-sharing Mn3+/4+ oxide with Mn-O bond lengths of mainly
1.87 {\AA} and some at 2.30 {\AA} as well as Mn-Mn bond lengths of 2.87 {\AA} based on fits to the extended
x-ray fine structure. The decrease of the currents at voltages before the onset of the OER followed
power laws with three different exponents depending on the number of cycles and the Tafel slope decreases
from 186 \pm 48 to 114 \pm 18 mV dec-1 after 100 cycles, which we interpret in the context of surface
coverage with unreacted intermediates. Post-mortem microscopy and bulk spectroscopy at the Mn-K
edge showed no change of the microstructure, bulk local structure or bulk Mn valence. Yet, the surface
region of MnOx oxidized toward Mn4+, which explains the reduction of the currents in agreement with
literature. Surprisingly, we find that MnOx reactivates after 30 min at open-circuit (OC), where
the currents and also the Tafel slope increase. Reactivation processes during OC are crucial because
OC is unavoidable when coupling the electrocatalysts to intermittent power sources such as solar
energy for sustainable energy production.

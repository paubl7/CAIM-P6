Diffusion MRI (dMRI) generally suffers from eddy currents induced by strong diffusion gradients,
which introduce artefacts that can impair subsequent diffusion metric analysis. Existing correction
techniques assume that eddy currents do not decay during acquisition, which is generally effective
for traditional Pulsed Gradient Spin Echo (PGSE) diffusion encoding. However, these methods do
not necessarily apply to advanced forms of dMRI that require substantial gradient slewing, such
as Oscillating Gradient Spin Echo (OGSE). In this work, dynamic field monitoring was used to characterize
diffusion gradient induced eddy currents for both PGSE and OGSE to assess the applicability of these
typical assumptions. The performance of an in-house algorithm (TVEDDY) that models eddy current
decay was evaluated by correcting in-vivo PGSE and OGSE brain images and comparing correction quality
with conventional methods using mean-squared error (MSE) between diffusion weighted images acquired
with opposite polarity diffusion gradients. As a ground truth comparison, spatially varying field
dynamics up to third order in space were used in a model-based iterative reconstruction to eliminate
distortions. Time-varying eddy currents were observed for OGSE, which introduced blurring along
the phase-encode direction that was not reduced using the traditional approach, but was diminished
considerably with TVEDDY and model-based reconstruction. No MSE difference was observed between
the conventional approach and TVEDDY for PGSE, but for OGSE TVEDDY resulted in significantly lower
MSE. The field-monitoring-informed model-based reconstruction had the lowest MSE for both PGSE
and OGSE. Accordingly, this work establishes that it is possible to estimate time-varying eddy
currents from the diffusion data itself, which provides substantial image quality improvements
for gradient-intensive dMRI acquisitions like OGSE.

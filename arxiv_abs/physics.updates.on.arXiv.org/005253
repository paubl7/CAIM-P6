Selective heating of a microparticle surface had been observed to cause its autonomous movement
in a fluid medium due to self-generated temperature gradients. In this work, we theoretically investigate
the response of such an auto-thermophoretic particle near a planar wall which is held isothermal.
We derive an exact solution of the energy equation and employ the Reynolds reciprocal theorem to
obtain the translational and rotational swimming velocities in the creeping flow limit. Subsequently,
we analyse the trajectories of the micromotor for different thermo-physical and configurational
parameters. Results show that the micromotor trajectories can be switched either from wall-bound
sliding or stationary state to escape from the near-wall zone by suitably choosing the particle
and the surrounding fluid pair having selective thermal conductivity contrasts. Further, we discuss
the dependency of this swimming-state transition on the launching orientation and the coverage
of the metallic cap. Our results reveal that the scenario addressed here holds several exclusive
distinguishing features from the otherwise extensively studied self-diffusiophoresis phenomenon
near an inert wall, despite obvious analogies in the respective constitutive laws relating the
fluxes with the gradients of the concerned forcing parameters. The most contrasting locomotion
behaviour here turns out to be the ability of a self-thermophoretic micromotor to migrate towards
the wall with large heated cap even if it is initially directed away from the wall. Besides, during
the stationary state of swimming, the cold portion on the micromotor surface faces away from the
wall, under all conditions. Such unique aspects of locomotion hold the potential of being harnessed
in practice towards achieving intricate control over autonomous motion of microparticles in thermally-regulated
fluidic environments.

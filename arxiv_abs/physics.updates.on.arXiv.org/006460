Magnetic reconnection, a plasma process converting magnetic energy to particle kinetic energy,
is often invoked to explain magnetic energy releases powering high-energy flares in astrophysical
sources including pulsar wind nebulae and black hole jets. Reconnection is usually seen as the (essentially
2D) nonlinear evolution of the tearing instability disrupting a thin current sheet. To test how
this process operates in 3D, we conduct a comprehensive particle-in-cell simulation study comparing
2D and 3D evolution of long, thin current sheets in moderately-magnetized, collisionless, relativistically-hot
electron-positron plasma, and find dramatic differences. We first systematically characterize
this process in 2D, where classic, hierarchical plasmoid-chain reconnection determines energy
release, and explore a wide range of initial configurations, guide magnetic field strengths, and
system sizes. We then show that 3D simulations of similar configurations exhibit a diversity of
behaviours, including some where energy release is determined by the nonlinear relativistic drift-kink
instability. Thus, 3D current-sheet evolution is not always fundamentally classical reconnection
with perturbing 3D effects, but, rather, a complex interplay of multiple linear and nonlinear instabilities
whose relative importance depends sensitively on the ambient plasma, minor configuration details,
and even stochastic events. It often yields slower but longer-lasting and ultimately greater magnetic
energy release than in 2D. Intriguingly, nonthermal particle acceleration is astonishingly robust,
depending on the upstream magnetization and guide field, but otherwise yielding similar particle
energy spectra in 2D and 3D. Though the variety of underlying current-sheet behaviours is interesting,
the similarities in overall energy release and particle spectra may be more remarkable.

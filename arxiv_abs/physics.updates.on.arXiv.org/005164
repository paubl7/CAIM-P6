Classical nonlinear random waves can exhibit a process of condensation. It originates in the singularity
of the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium distribution and it is characterized by the macroscopic population
of the fundamental mode of the system. Several recent experiments revealed a phenomenon of spatial
beam cleaning of an optical field that propagates through a graded-index multimode optical fiber
(MMF). Our aim in this article is to provide physical insight into the mechanism underlying optical
beam self-cleaning through the analysis of wave condensation in the presence of structural disorder
inherent to MMFs. We consider experiments of beam cleaning where long pulses are injected in the
and populate many modes of a 10-20 m MMF, for which the dominant contribution of disorder originates
from polarization random fluctuations (weak disorder). On the basis of the wave turbulence theory,
we derive nonequilibrium kinetic equations describing the random waves in a regime where disorder
dominates nonlinear effects. The theory reveals that the presence of a conservative weak disorder
introduces an effective dissipation in the system, which is shown to inhibit wave condensation
in the usual continuous wave turbulence approach. On the other hand, the experiments of beam cleaning
are described by a discrete wave turbulence approach, where the effective dissipation induced
by disorder modifies the regularization of wave resonances, which leads to an acceleration of condensation
that can explain the effect of beam self-cleaning. The simulations are in quantitative agreement
with the theory. The analysis also reveals that the effect of beam cleaning is characterized by a
repolarization as a natural consequence of the condensation process. In addition, the discrete
wave turbulence approach explains why optical beam self-cleaning has not been observed in step-index
multimode fibers.

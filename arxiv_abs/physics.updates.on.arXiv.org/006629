Since Newton all of classical and quantum physics depends upon the "Newtonian Paradigm" (NP). Here
the relevant variables of the system are identified. The boundary conditions creating the phase
space of all possible values of the variables are defined. Then, given any initial condition, the
differential equations of motion are integrated to yield an entailed trajectory in the pre-stated
phase space. In the NP the set of possibilities that constitute the phase space is always definable
ahead of time. All of this fails for the diachronic evolution of ever new adaptations in our or any
biosphere. The central reason is that living cells achieve Constraint Closure and construct themselves.
Living cells, evolving via heritable variation and Natural selection, adaptively construct new
in the universe possibilities. The new possibilities are opportunities for new adaptations thereafter
seized by heritable variation and Natural Selection. Surprisingly, we can neither define nor deduce
the evolving phase spaces ahead of time. The reason we cannot deduce the ever-evolving phase spaces
of life is that we can use no mathematics based on Set Theory to do so. The ever-new adaptations with
ever-new relevant variables constitute the ever-changing phase space of evolving biospheres.
Because of this, evolving biospheres are entirely outside the NP. One consequence is that for any
universe such as ours with one or more evolving biospheres, there can be no final theory that entails
all that comes to exist. We face a third major transition in science. We must give up deducing the diachronic
evolution of the biosphere. All of physics, classical and quantum, however, apply to the analysis
of existing life, a synchronic analysis. We begin to better understand the emergent creativity
of an evolving biosphere. We are on the edge of inventing a physics-like new statistical mechanics
of emergence.

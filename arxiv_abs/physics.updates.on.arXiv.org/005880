Development of the methods to exploit nuclear hyperpolarization and search for molecules whose
nuclear spins can be efficiently hyperpolarized is an active area in nuclear magnetic resonance.
Of particular interest are those molecules that have long nuclear relaxation times, making them
to be suitable candidates as contrast agents in magnetic resonance imaging. In this work, we present
a detailed study of SABRE SHEATH (Signal Amplification By Reversible Exchange in Shield Enabled
Alignment Transfer to Heteronuclei) experiments of 15N,15N' azobenzene. In SABRE SHEATH experiments
nuclear spins of the target are hyperpolarized by transfer of spin polarization from parahydrogen
at ultralow fields during a reversible chemical process. The studied system is complicated, and
we are concerned only about a subset of the data, presenting details for the molecules that experience
fast chemical exchange at the catalytic complex and thus are involved in polarizing the free azobenzene.
Azobenzene exists in two isomers trans- and cis-. We show that all nuclear spins in cis-azobenzene
can be efficiently hyperpolarized by SABRE at suitable magnetic fields. Enhancement factors (relative
to 9.4 T) reach several thousands of times for 15N spins and a few tens of times for the 1H spins. There
are two approaches to observe either hyperpolarized magnetization of 15N/1H spins or hyperpolarized
singlet order of the 15N spin pair. We compare these approaches and present the field dependencies
of SABRE experiments for them. No hyperpolarization of trans 15N,15N' azobenzene was observed.
The results presented here will be useful for further experiments where hyperpolarized cis-15N,15N'
azobenzene is switched by light to trans 15N,15N' azobenzene for storing the produced hyperpolarization
in the long-lived spin state of the 15N pair of trans-15N,15N' azobenzene.

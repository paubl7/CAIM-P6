The evolution of the photospheric magnetic field plays a key role in the energy transport into the
chromosphere and the corona. In active regions, newly emerging magnetic flux interacts with the
pre-existent magnetic field, which can lead to reconnection events that convert magnetic energy
to thermal energy. We aim to study the heating caused by a strong reconnection event that was triggered
by magnetic flux cancellation. We use imaging-spectropolarimetric data in the Fe I 6301A, Fe I 6302A,
Ca II 8542A and Ca II K obtained with the CRISP and CHROMIS instruments at the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope.
This data was inverted using multi-atom, multi-line non-LTE inversions using the STiC code. The
inversion yielded a three-dimensional model of the reconnection event and surrounding atmosphere,
including temperature, velocity, microturbulence, magnetic file configuration, and the radiative
loss rate. The model atmosphere shows the emergence of magnetic loops with a size of several arcsecs
into a pre-existing predominantly unipolar field. Where the reconnection region is expected to
be, we see an increase in the chromospheric temperature of roughly 2000 K as well as bidirectional
flows of the order of 10 km s$^{-1}$ emanating from the region. We see bright blobs of roughly 0.2 arcsec
diameter in the Ca II K moving at a plane-of-the-sky velocity of order 100 km s$^{-1}$ and a blueshift
of 100 km s$^{-1}$, which we interpret as plasmoids ejected from the same region. This evidence is
consistent with theoretical models of reconnection and we thus conclude that reconnection is taking
place. The chromospheric radiative losses at the reconnection site in our inferred model are as
high as 160 kW m$^{-2}$, providing a quantitative constraint on theoretical models that aim to simulate
reconnection caused by flux emergence in the chromosphere.

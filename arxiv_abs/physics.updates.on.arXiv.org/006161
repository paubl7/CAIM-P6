Reaction-diffusion waves have long been used to describe the growth and spread of populations undergoing
a spatial range expansion. Such waves are generally classed as either pulled, where the dynamics
are driven by the very tip of the front and stochastic fluctuations are high, or pushed, where cooperation
in growth or dispersal results in a bulk-driven wave in which fluctuations are suppressed. These
concepts have been well studied experimentally in populations where the cooperation leads to a
density-dependent growth rate. By contrast, relatively little is known about experimental populations
that exhibit density-dependent dispersal. Using bacteriophage T7 as a test organism, we present
novel experimental measurements that demonstrate that the diffusion of phage T7, in a lawn of host
E. coli, is hindered by steric interactions with host bacteria cells. The coupling between host
density, phage dispersal and cell lysis caused by viral infection results in an effective density-dependent
diffusion coefficient akin to cooperative behavior. Using a system of reaction-diffusion equations,
we show that this effect can result in a transition from a pulled to pushed expansion. Moreover, we
find that a second, independent density-dependent effect on phage dispersal spontaneously emerges
as a result of the viral incubation period, during which phage is trapped inside the host unable to
disperse. Additional stochastic agent-based simulations reveal that lysis time dramatically
affects the rate of diversity loss in viral expansions. Taken together, our results indicate both
that bacteriophage can be used as a controllable laboratory population to investigate the impact
of density-dependent dispersal on evolution, and that the genetic diversity and adaptability
of expanding viral populations could be much greater than is currently assumed.

The past decade has witnessed major advances in the development of microresonator-based frequency
combs (microcombs) that are broadband optical frequency combs with repetition rates in the millimeter-wave
to microwave domain. Integrated microcombs can be manufactured using wafer-scale process and
have been applied in numerous applications. Most of these advances are based on the harnessing of
dissipative Kerr solitons (DKS) in optical microresonators with anomalous group velocity dispersion
(GVD). However, microcombs can also be generated with normal GVD using dissipative localized structures
that are referred to as "dark pulse", "switching wave" or "platicon". Importantly, as most materials
feature intrinsic normal GVD, the requirement of dispersion engineering is significantly relaxed
for platicon generation. Therefore while DKS microcombs require particular designs and fabrication
processes, platicon microcombs can be readily built using standard CMOS-compatible platforms
such as thin-film (i.e. typically below 300 nm) Si3N4. Yet laser self-injection locking that has
been recently used to create highly compact integrated DKS microcomb modules has not been demonstrated
for platicons. Here we report the first fully integrated platicon microcomb operating at a microwave-K-band
repetition rate. Using laser self-injection locking of a DFB laser edge-coupled to a Si3N4 microresonator,
platicons are electrically initiated and stably maintained, enabling a compact microcomb module
without any complex control. We further characterize the phase noise of the platicon repetition
rate and the pumping laser. The observation of self-injection-locked platicons facilitates future
wide adoption of microcombs as a build-in block in standard photonic integrated architectures
via commercial foundry service.

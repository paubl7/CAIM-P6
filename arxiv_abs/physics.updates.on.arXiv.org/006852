Collisionless dissipation of macroscopic energy into heat is an unsolved problem of space and astrophysical
plasmas, e.g., solar wind and Earth's magnetosheath. The most viable process under consideration
is the turbulent-cascade of macroscopic energy to kinetic-scales where collisionless-plasma-processes
dissipate the energy. Space observations and numerical simulations show the formation of kinetic
scale current sheets in turbulent plasmas. Instabilities in these CS can provide collisionless
dissipation and influence the turbulence. Spatial gradients of physical quantities and non-Maxwellian
velocity distribution functions provide the free-energy-sources for CS plasma instabilities.
To determine the free-energy-sources provided by the spatial gradients of plasma density and electron/ion
bulk velocities in CS formed in collisionless turbulent plasmas with an external magnetic field
$\mathbf{B}_0$, we carried out two-dimensional PIC-hybrid simulations and interpret the results
within the limitations of the simulation model. We found that ion-scale CS in a collisionless turbulent
plasma are formed primarily by electron shear flows, i.e., electron bulk velocity inside CS is much
larger than ion bulk velocity while the density variations through the CS are relatively small ($<$
10\%). The electron-bulk-velocity and, thus, the current density inside the sheets are directed
mainly parallel to $\mathbf{B}_0$. The shear in the perpendicular electron- and ion-bulk-velocities
generates parallel electron- and ion-flow-vorticities. Inside CS, parallel electron-flow-vorticity
exceeds the parallel ion-flow-vorticity, changes sign around the CS centers and peaks near the
CS edges. An ion temperature anisotropy develops near CS during the CS formation. It has positive
correlation with the parallel ion- and electron-flow-vorticities. Theoretical estimates support
the simulation results.

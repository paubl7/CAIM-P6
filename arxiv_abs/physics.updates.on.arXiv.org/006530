Leaf hydraulic networks play an important role not only in fluid transport but also in maintaining
whole-plant water status through transient environmental changes in soil-based water supply
or air humidity. Both water potential and hydraulic resistance vary spatially throughout the leaf
transport network, consisting of xylem, stomata and water-storage cells, and portions of leaf
areas far from the leaf base can be disproportionately disadvantaged under water stress. Besides
the suppression of transpiration and reduction of water loss caused by stomatal closure, the leaf
capacitance of water storage, which can also vary locally, is thought to be crucial for the maintenance
of leaf water status. In order to study the fluid dynamics in these networks, we develop a spatially
explicit, capacitive model which is able to capture the local spatiotemporal changes of water potential
and flow rate. In electrical-circuit analogues described by Ohm's law, we implement linear capacitors
imitating water storage, and we present both analytical calculations of a uniform one-dimensional
model and numerical simulation methods for general spatially explicit network models, and their
relation to conventional lumped-element models. Calculation and simulation results are shown
for the uniform model, which mimics key properties of a monocotyledonous grass leaf. We illustrate
water status of a well-watered leaf, and the lowering of water potential and transpiration rate
caused by excised water source or reduced air humidity. We show that the time scales of these changes
under water stress are hugely affected by leaf capacitance and resistances to capacitors, in addition
to stomatal resistance. Through this modeling of a grass leaf, we confirm the presence of uneven
water distribution over leaf area, and also discuss the importance of considering the spatial variation
of leaf hydraulic traits in plant biology.

Most studies that examine CO2-neutral, or near CO2-neutral, power systems by using energy system
models investigate Europe or the United States, while similar studies for other regions are rare.
In this paper, we focus on the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), where weather conditions differ
substantially from those in Europe. We use a green-field linear capacity expansion model with over-night
investment to assess the effect on the system cost of (i) limiting/expanding the amount of land available
for wind and solar farms, (ii) allowing for nuclear power and (iii) disallowing for international
transmission. The assessment is done under three different cost regimes for solar PV and battery
storage. First, we find that the amount of available land for wind and solar farms can have a significant
impact on the system cost, with a cost increase of 0-50% as a result of reduced available land. Second,
allowing for nuclear power has a minor effect in MENA, while it may decrease the system cost in Europe
by up to 20%. In Europe, the effect on system cost from allowing for nuclear power is highly dependent
on the PV and battery cost regime. Third, disallowing for international transmission increases
the system cost by up to 25% in both Europe and MENA. The impacts on system cost from these three controversial
and policy-relevant factors in a decarbonized power system thus play out differently, depending
on (i) the region and (ii) uncertain future investment costs for solar PV and storage. We conclude
that a renewable power system in MENA is likely to be less costly than one in Europe, irrespective
of future uncertainties regarding investment cost for PV and batteries, and policies surrounding
nuclear power, transmission, and land available for wind and solar farms.

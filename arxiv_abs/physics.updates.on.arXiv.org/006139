Due to their small size and unique properties, single-molecule electronics have long seen research
interest from experimentalists and theoreticians alike. From a theoretical standpoint, modeling
these systems using electronic structure theory can be difficult due to the importance of electron
correlation in the determination of molecular properties, and this electron correlation can be
computationally expensive to consider, particularly multiconfigurational correlation energy.
In this work, we develop a new approach for the study of single-molecule electronic systems, denoted
NEGF-MCPDFT, which combines multiconfiguration pair-density functional theory (MC-PDFT) with
the non-equilibrium Green's function formalism (NEGF). The use of MC-PDFT with NEGF allows for
the efficient inclusion of both static and dynamic electron correlation in the description of the
junction's electronic structure. CASSCF wave functions are used as references in the MC-PDFT calculation,
and like with any active space method, effort must be made to determine the proper orbital character
to include in the active space. We perform conductance and transmission calculations on a series
of alkanes (predominantly single-configurational character) and benzyne (multiconfigurational
character), exploring the role that active space selection has on the computed results. For the
alkane junctions explored (where dynamic electron correlation dominates), the MCPDFT-NEGF results
agree well with DFT-NEGF results. For the benzyne junction (which has significant static correlation),
we see clear differences in the MCPDFT-NEGF and DFT-NEGF results, and evidence that NEGF-MCPDFT
is capturing additional electron correlation effects beyond those provided by the PBE functional.

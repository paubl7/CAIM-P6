Metal oxide (MOx) electro-chemical gas sensors are a sensible choice for many applications, due
to their tunable sensitivity, their space-efficiency and their low price. Publicly available
sensor datasets streamline the development and evaluation of novel algorithm and circuit designs,
making them particularly valuable for the Artificial Olfaction / Mobile Robot Olfaction community.
In 2013, Vergara et al. published a dataset comprising 16 months of recordings from a large MOx gas
sensor array in a wind tunnel, which has since become a standard benchmark in the field. Here we report
a previously undetected property of the dataset that limits its suitability for gas classification
studies. The analysis of individual measurement timestamps reveals that gases were recorded in
temporally clustered batches. The consequential correlation between the sensor response before
gas exposure and the time of recording is often sufficient to predict the gas used in a given trial.
Even if compensated by zero-offset-subtraction, residual short-term drift contains enough information
for gas classification. We have identified a minimally drift-affected subset of the data, which
is suitable for gas classification benchmarking after zero-offset-subtraction, although gas
classification performance was substantially lower than for the full dataset. We conclude that
previous studies conducted with this dataset very likely overestimate the accuracy of gas classification
results. For the 17 potentially affected publications, we urge the authors to re-evaluate the results
in light of our findings. Our observations emphasize the need to thoroughly document gas sensing
datasets, and proper validation before using them for the development of algorithms.

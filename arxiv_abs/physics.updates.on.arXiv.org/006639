An MRI-only adaptive radiotherapy (ART) workflow is desirable for managing interfractional changes
in anatomy, but producing synthetic CT (sCT) data through paired data-driven deep learning (DL)
for abdominal dose calculations remains a challenge due to the highly variable presence of intestinal
gas. We present the preliminary dosimetric evaluation of our novel approach to sCT reconstruction
that is well suited to handling intestinal gas in abdominal MRI-only ART. We utilize a paired data
DL approach enabled by the intensity projection prior, in which well-matching training pairs are
created by propagating air from MRI to corresponding CT scans. Evaluations focus on two classes:
patients with (1) little involvement of intestinal gas, and (2) notable differences in intestinal
gas presence between corresponding scans. Comparisons between sCT-based plans and CT-based clinical
plans for both classes are made at the first treatment fraction to highlight the dosimetric impact
of the variable presence of intestinal gas. Class 1 patients ($n=13$) demonstrate differences
in prescribed dose coverage of the PTV of $1.3 \pm 2.1\%$ between clinical plans and sCT-based plans.
Mean DVH differences in all structures for Class 1 patients are found to be statistically insignificant.
In Class 2 ($n=20$), target coverage is $13.3 \pm 11.0\%$ higher in the clinical plans and mean DVH
differences are found to be statistically significant. Significant deviations in calculated
doses arising from the variable presence of intestinal gas in corresponding CT and MRI scans may
limit the effectiveness of adaptive dose escalation efforts. We have proposed a paired data-driven
DL approach to sCT reconstruction for accurate dose calculations in abdominal ART enabled by the
creation of a clinically unavailable training data set with well-matching representations of
intestinal gas.

Airfoil stall plays a central role in the design of safe and efficient lifting surfaces. We typically
distinguish between static and dynamic stall based on the unsteady rate of change of an airfoil's
angle of attack. Despite the somewhat misleading denotation, the force and flow development of
an airfoil undergoing static stall are highly unsteady and the boundary with dynamic stall is not
clearly defined. We experimentally investigate the forces acting on a two-dimensional airfoil
that is subjected to two manoeuvres leading to static stall: a slow continuous increase in angle
of attack with a reduced pitch rate of 1.3e-4 and a step-wise increase in angle of attack from 14.2{\deg}
to 14.8{\deg} within 0.04 convective times. We systematically quantify the stall reaction delay
for many repetitions of these two manoeuvres. The onset of flow stall is marked by the distinct drop
in the lift coefficient. The reaction delay for the slow continuous ramp-up manoeuvre is not influenced
by the blade kinematics and its occurrence histogram is normally distributed around 32 convective
times. The static reaction delay is compared with dynamic stall delays for dynamic ramp-up motions
with reduced pitch rates ranging from 9e-4 to 0.14 and for dynamic sinusoidal pitching motions of
different airfoils at higher Reynolds numbers up to 1e6. The stall delays for all conditions follows
the same power law decrease from 32 convective times for the most steady case down to an asymptotic
value of 3 for reduced pitch rates above 0.04. Static stall is not phenomenologically different
than dynamic stall and is merely a typical case of stall for low pitch rates. Based on our results,
we suggest that conventional measurements of the static stall angle and the static load curves should
be conducted using a continuous and uniform ramp-up motion at a reduced frequency around 1e-4.

Active particles often swim in confined environments. The transport mechanisms, especially the
global one as reflected by the Taylor dispersion model, are of great practical interest to various
applications. For active dispersion process in confined flows, previous analytical studies focused
on the long-time asymptotic values of dispersion characteristics. Only several numerical studies
preliminarily investigated the temporal evolution. Extending recent studies of Jiang & Chen (J.
Fluid Mech., vol. 877, 2019, pp. 1--34; J. Fluid Mech., vol. 899, 2020, A18), this work makes the first
analytical attempt to investigate the transient process. The temporal evolution of the local distribution
in the confined-section--orientation space, drift, dispersivity and skewness, is explored based
on moments of distributions. We introduce the biorthogonal expansion method for solutions because
the classic integral transform method for passive transport problems is not applicable due to the
self-propulsion effect. Two types of boundary condition, the reflective condition and the Robin
condition for wall accumulation, are imposed respectively. A detailed study on spherical and ellipsoidal
swimmers dispersing in a plane Poiseuille flow demonstrates the influences of the swimming, shear
flow, wall accumulation and particle shape on the transient dispersion process after a point-source
release. The swimming-induced diffusion makes the local distribution reach its equilibrium state
faster than that of passive particles. Though the wall accumulation significantly affects the
evolution of the local distribution and the drift, the time scale to reach the Taylor regime is not
obviously changed. The shear-induced alignment of ellipsoidal particles can enlarge the dispersivity
but has less influence on the drift and the skewness.

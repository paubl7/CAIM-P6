The transverse Rashba effect is proposed and investigated by the first-principle calculations
based on density functional theory in a quasi-one-dimensional antiferromagnet with a strong perpendicular
magnetocrystalline anisotropy, which is materialized by the Gd-adsorbed graphene nanoribbon
with a centric symmetry. The Rashba effect in this system is associated with the local dipole field
transverse to and in the plane of the nanoribbon. That dipole field is induced by the off-center adsorption
of the Gd adatom above the hex-carbon ring near the nanoribbon edges. The transverse Rashba effect
at the two Gd adatoms enhances each other in the antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state and cancels
each other in the ferromagnetic (FM) meta-stable state, because of the centrosymmetric atomic
structure. The transverse Rashba parameter is 1.51 eV A. This system shows a strong perpendicular
magnetocrystalline anisotropy (MCA), which is 1.4 meV per Gd atom in the AFM state or 2.2 meV per Gd
atom in the FM state. The origin of the perpendicular MCA is analyzed in k-space by filtering out the
contribution of the transverse Rashba effect from the band structures perturbed by the spin-orbit
coupling interactions. The first-order perturbation of the orbit and spin angular momentum coupling
is the major source of the MCA, which is associated with the one-dimensionality of the system. The
transverse Rashba effect and the strong perpendicular magnetization hosted simultaneously by
the proposed AFM Gd-adsorbed graphene nanoribbon lock the up- (or down-) spin quantization direction
to the forward (or backward) movement. This finding offers a magnetic approach to a high coherency
spin propagation in one-dimensionality, and open a new door to manipulating spin transportation
in graphene-based spintronics.

We use Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations and single molecule experiments to investigate the influence
of topological constraints and hydrodynamic interactions on the dynamics and rheology of solutions
of ring-linear polymer blends at the overlap concentration. We find agreement between simulation
and experiment in that rings in solution blends exhibit large conformational fluctuations, including
extension overshoots on the startup of flow and tumbling and tank-treading at steady state. Ring
polymer fluctuations increase with blend fraction of linear polymers and are peaked at a ring Weissenberg
number $\textrm{Wi}_R \approx 1.5$. On the contrary, linear and ring polymers in their pure solution
show a peak in fluctuations at the critical coil-stretch Weissenberg number $\textrm{Wi} = 0.5$.
BD simulations show that extension overshoots on startup of flow are due to flow-induced intermolecular
ring-linear polymer hooks, whereas fluctuations at steady state are driven by intermolecular
hydrodynamic interactions (HI). The streamlines determined from BD simulation are qualitatively
comparable to elastic instabilities in cross-slot flow of polymer solutions, and we speculate
that the dynamics of solution blends may be understood by deviations of the flow from planar extension.
This is supported by simulations of bidisperse linear polymer solution blends, which show similar
trends in conformational dynamics between rings and linear polymers with a matched contour length.
Comparing to BD simulations, single molecule experiments show quantitatively larger fluctuations,
which could arise because experiments are performed on higher molecular weight polymers with stronger
entanglement effects. To this end, we have advanced the understanding of the effects of topological
interactions and intermolecular HI on the dynamics of semidilute ring-linear polymer blend solutions.

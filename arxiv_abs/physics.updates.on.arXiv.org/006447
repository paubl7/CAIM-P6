Solving the wave equation is one of the most (if not the most) fundamental problems we face as we try
to illuminate the Earth using recorded seismic data. The Helmholtz equation provides wavefield
solutions that are dimensionally reduced, per frequency, compared to the time domain, which is
useful for many applications, like full waveform inversion (FWI). However, our ability to attain
such wavefield solutions depends often on the size of the model and the complexity of the wave equation.
Thus, we use here a recently introduced framework based on neural networks to predict functional
solutions through setting the underlying physical equation as a loss function to optimize the neural
network parameters. For an input given by a location in the model space, the network learns to predict
the wavefield value at that location, and its partial derivatives using a concept referred to as
automatic differentiation, to fit, in our case, a form of the Helmholtz equation. We specifically
seek the solution of the scattered wavefield considering a simple homogeneous background model
that allows for analytical solutions of the background wavefield. Providing the neural network
(NN) a reasonable number of random points from the model space will ultimately train a fully connected
deep NN to predict the scattered wavefield function. The size of the network depends mainly on the
complexity of the desired wavefield, with such complexity increasing with increasing frequency
and increasing model complexity. However, smaller networks can provide smoother wavefields that
might be useful for inversion applications. Preliminary tests on a two-box-shaped scatterer model
with a source in the middle, as well as, the Marmousi model with a source on the surface demonstrate
the potential of the NN for this application. Additional tests on a 3D model demonstrate the potential
versatility of the approach.

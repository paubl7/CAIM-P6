In the energy-momentum density expressions for a relativistic perfect fluid with a bulk motion,
one comes across a couple of pressure-dependent terms, which though well known, are to an extent,
lacking in their conceptual basis and the ensuing physical interpretation. In the expression for
the energy density, the rest mass density along with the kinetic energy density of the fluid constituents
due to their random motion, which contributes to the pressure as well, are already included. However,
in a fluid with a bulk motion, there are, in addition, a couple of explicit, pressure-dependent terms
in the energy-momentum densities, whose presence to an extent, is shrouded in mystery, especially
from a physical perspective. We show here that one such pressure-dependent term appearing in the
energy density, represents the work done by the fluid pressure against the Lorentz contraction
during transition from the rest frame of the fluid to another frame in which the fluid has a bulk motion.
This applies equally to the electromagnetic energy density of electrically charged systems in
motion and explains in a natural manner an apparently paradoxical result that the field energy of
a charged capacitor system decreases with an increase in the system velocity. The momentum density
includes another pressure-dependent term, that represents an energy flow across the system, due
to the opposite signs of work being done by pressure on two opposite sides of the moving fluid. From
Maxwell's stress tensor we demonstrate that in the expression for electromagnetic momentum of
an electric charged particle, it is the presence of a similar pressure term, arising from electrical
self-repulsion forces in the charged sphere, that yields a natural solution for the notorious,
more than a century old but thought by many as still unresolved, 4/3 problem in the electromagnetic
momentum.

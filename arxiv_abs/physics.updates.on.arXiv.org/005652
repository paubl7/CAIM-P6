While the use of spatial agent-based and individual-based models has flourished across many scientific
disciplines, the complexities these models generate are often difficult to manage and quantify.
This research reduces population-driven, spatial modeling of individuals to the simplest configurations
and parameters: an equal resource opportunity landscape with equally capable individuals; and
asks the question, "Will valid complex population and inequality dynamics emerge from this simple
economic model?" Two foraging economies are modeled: subsistence and surplus. The resulting,
emergent population dynamics are characterized by their sensitivities to agent and landscape
parameters. The various steady and oscillating regimes of single-species population dynamics
are generated by appropriate selection of model growth parameters. These emergent dynamics are
shown to be consistent with the equation-based, continuum modeling of single-species populations
in biology and ecology. The intrinsic growth rates, carry capacities, and delay parameters of these
models are implied for these simple economies. Aggregate measures of individual distributions
are used to understand the sensitivities to model parameters. New local measures are defined to
describe complex behaviors driven by spatial effects, especially extinctions. This simple economic
model is shown to generate significantly complex population and inequality dynamics. Model parameters
generating the intrinsic growth rate have strong effects on these dynamics, including large variations
in inequality. Significant inequality effects are shown to be caused by birth costs above and beyond
their contribution to the intrinsic growth rate. The highest levels of inequality are found during
the initial non-equilibrium period and are driven by factors different than those driving steady
state inequality.

The building sector is responsible for 40% of primary energy consumption, with heating/cooling
covering the most significant portion. Thus, passive heating/cooling applications have gained
significant ground during the last three decades, with many research activities on the subject.
Among passive cooling/heating applications, ground cooling (especially earth-to-air heat exchangers)
has been highlighted as a remarkably attractive technological research subjects because of its
significant contribution to the reduction of heating/cooling energy loads; the improvement of
indoor thermal comfort conditions; and the amelioration of the urban environment. This paper presents
a holistic review of state-of-the-art research, methodologies, and technologies of earth-to-air
heat exchangers that help achieve energy conservation and thermal comfort in the built environment.
The review covers the critical subject of the thermal performance of earth-to-air heat exchanger
systems; experimental studies and applications; parametric studies for investigating the impact
of their main characteristics on thermal efficiency; and recent advances and trends including
hybrid technologies and systems. The models describing the thermal performance of earth-to-air
heat exchangers systems were classified in numerical, analytical, and data-driven; their main
theoretical principles were presented; and experimental validation was mentioned when carried
out. System parameters were grouped into three categories: system design, soil types, and soil
surface coverage. System design parameters, especially length and burial depth, bore the most
important influence on the thermal efficiency of the system. The paper was rounded up with an economic
assessment of system application, and the conclusions highlighted the need for more experimental
work including laboratory simulators.

We investigate numerically the influence of a weak current on wind-generated surface deformations
for wind velocity below the onset of regular waves. In that regime, the liquid surface is populated
by small disorganised deformations elongated in the wind direction, referred to as wrinkles. These
wrinkles are the superposition of incoherent wakes generated by the pressure fluctuations traveling
in the turbulent boundary layer in the air. In this work, we account for the effect of a weak sheared
current in the liquid, either longitudinal or transverse, by introducing a modified Doppler-shifted
dispersion relation to lowest order in viscosity and current in the spectral theory previously
derived by Perrard et al (2019). This theory describes the simplified one-way problem of surface
deformations excited by a prescribed turbulent forcing, thereby neglecting the retroaction of
waves on turbulence in the air. The forcing is taken from a set of direct numerical simulations of
a turbulent channel flow. We determine the wrinkle properties (size and amplitude) as a function
of the liquid viscosity and current properties (surface velocity, thickness and orientation).
We find significant modifications of the wrinkle geometry by the currents: the wrinkles are tilted
for a transverse current, and show finer scales for a longitudinal current. However, their characteristic
size is weakly affected, and their amplitude remains independent of the current. We discuss the
implications of these results on the onset of regular waves at larger wind velocity. In this work,
we introduce a spectral interpolation method to evaluate the surface deformation fields, based
on a refined meshing close to the dispersion relation of the waves. This method, which can be extended
to any dispersive system excited by a random forcing, strongly reduces the discretization effects
at a low computational cost.

Convection in the Sun occurs at Rayleigh numbers, $Ra$, as high as $10^{22}$, molecular Prandtl
number, $Pr$, as low as $10^{-6}$, and occurs under conditions that are far from satisfying the Oberbeck-Boussinesq
(OB) idealization. The effects of these extreme circumstances on turbulent heat transport are
unknown, and no comparable conditions exist on Earth. Our goal is to understand how these effects
scale (since we cannot yet replicate the Sun's conditions faithfully). We study thermal convection
by using direct numerical simulations, and determine the variation with respect to $Pr$, up to $Pr$
as low as $10^{-4}$, of the turbulent Prandtl number, $Pr_t$, which is the ratio of turbulent viscosity
to thermal diffusivity. The simulations are primarily two-dimensional but we draw upon some three-dimensional
results as well. We focus on non-Oberbeck-Boussinesq (NOB) conditions of a certain type, but also
study OB convection for comparison. The OB simulations are performed in a rectangular box of aspect
ratio 2 by varying $Pr$ from $O(10)$ to $10^{-4}$ at fixed Grashof number $Gr \equiv Ra/Pr = 10^9$.
The NOB simulations are done in the same box by letting only the thermal diffusivity depend on the
temperature. Here, the Rayleigh number is fixed at the top boundary while the mean $Pr$ varies in
the bulk from 0.07 to $5 \times 10^{-4}$. The three-dimensional simulations are performed in a box
of aspect ratio 25 at a fixed Rayleigh number of $10^5$, and $0.005 < Pr < 7$. The principal finding
is that $Pr_t$ increases with decreasing $Pr$ in both OB and NOB convection: $Pr_t \sim Pr^{-0.3}$
for OB convection and $Pr_t \sim Pr^{-1}$ for the NOB case. The $Pr_t$-dependence for the NOB case
especially suggests that convective flows in the astrophysical settings behave effectively as
in high-Prandtl-number turbulence.

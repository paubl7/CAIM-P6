In modern geodynamics, isostasy can be viewed either as the static equilibrium of the crust that
minimizes deviatoric stresses, or as a dynamic process resulting from the viscous relaxation of
the non-hydrostatic crustal shape. Paper I gave a general formulation of Airy isostasy as an elastic
loading problem solved with Love numbers, and applied it to the case of minimum stress isostasy.
In this sequel, the same framework is used to study Airy isostasy as the long-time evolution of a viscoelastic
shell submitted to surface and internal loads. Isostatic ratios are defined in terms of time-dependent
deviatoric Love numbers. Dynamic isostasy depends on the loading history, two examples of which
are the constant load applied on the surface in the far past and the constant shape maintained by addition
or removal of material at the compensation depth. The former model results in a shape decreasing
exponentially with time and has no elastic analog, whereas the latter (stationary) model is equivalent
to a form of elastic isostasy. Viscoelastic and viscous approaches are completely equivalent.
If both load and shape vary slowly with time, isostatic ratios look like those of the stationary model.
Isostatic models thus belong to two independent groups: the elastic/stationary approaches and
the time-dependent approaches. If the shell is homogeneous, all models predict a similar compensation
of large-scale gravity perturbations. If the shell rheology depends on depth, stationary models
predict more compensation at long wavelengths, whereas time-dependent models result in negligible
compensation. Mathematica and Fortran codes are available for computing the isostatic ratios
of an incompressible body with three homogeneous layers.

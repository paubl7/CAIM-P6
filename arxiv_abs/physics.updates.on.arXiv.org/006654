Differences in the social and economic environment across countries encourage humans to migrate
in search of better living conditions, including job opportunities, higher salaries, security
and welfare. Quantifying global migration is, however, challenging because of poor recording,
privacy issues and residence status. This is particularly critical for some classes of migrants
involved in stigmatised, unregulated or illegal activities. Escorting services or high-end prostitution
are well-paid activities that attract workers all around the world. In this paper, we study international
migration patterns of sex-workers by using network methods. Using an extensive international
online advertisement directory of escorting services and information about individual escorts,
we reconstruct a migrant flow network where nodes represent either origin or destination countries.
The links represent the direct routes between two countries. The migration network of sex-workers
shows different structural patterns than the migration of the general population. The network
contains a strong core where mutual migration is often observed between a group of high-income European
countries, yet Europe is split into different network communities with specific ties to non-European
countries. We find non-reciprocal relations between countries, with some of them mostly offering
while others attract workers. The GDP per capita is a good indicator of country attractiveness for
incoming workers and service rates but is unrelated to the probability of emigration. The median
financial gain of migrating, in comparison to working at the home country, is 15.9%. Only sex-workers
coming from 77% of the countries have financial gains with migration and average gains decrease
with the GDPc of the country of origin. Our results shows that high-end sex-worker migration is regulated
by economic, geographic and cultural aspects.

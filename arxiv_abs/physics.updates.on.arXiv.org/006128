We present an approach for automated in-situ monitoring of phytoplankton and zooplankton communities
based on a dual magnification dark-field imaging microscope/camera. We describe the Dual Scripps
Plankton Camera (DSPC) system and associated image processing, and assess its capabilities in
detecting and characterizing plankton species of different size and taxonomic categories, and
in measuring their abundances in both laboratory and field applications. In the laboratory, body
size and abundance estimates by the DSPC significantly and robustly scale with the same measurements
derived by traditional microscopy. In the field, a DSPC installed permanently at 3 m depth in Lake
Greifensee (Switzerland), delivered images of plankton individuals, colonies, and heterospecific
aggregates without disrupting natural arrangements of interacting organisms, their microenvironment
or their behavior at hourly timescales. The DSPC was able to track the dynamics of taxa in the size
range between ~10 $\mu$m to ~ 1 cm, covering virtually all the components of the planktonic food web
(including parasites and potentially toxic cyanobacteria). Comparing data from the field-deployed
DSPC to traditional sampling and microscopy revealed a general overall agreement in estimates
of plankton diversity and abundances, despite imaging limitations in detecting small phytoplankton
species and rare and large zooplankton taxa (e.g. carnivorous zooplankton). The most significant
disagreements between traditional methods and the DSPC resided in the measurements of community
properties of zooplankton, organisms that are heterogeneously distributed spatially and temporally,
and whose demography appeared to be better captured by automated imaging. Time series collected
by the DSPC depicted ecological succession patterns, algal bloom dynamics and circadian fluctuations
with a temporal frequency and morphological [continues...]

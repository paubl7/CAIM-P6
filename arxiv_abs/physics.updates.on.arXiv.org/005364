Hair cells of the auditory and vestibular systems display astonishing sensitivity, frequency
selectivity, and temporal resolution to external signals. These specialized cells utilize an
internal active amplifier to achieve highly sensitive mechanical detection. One of the manifestations
of this active process is the occurrence of spontaneous limit-cycle motion of the hair cell bundle.
As hair bundles under in vivo conditions are typically coupled to each other by overlying structures,
we explore the role of this coupling on the dynamics of the system, using a combination of theoretical
and experimental approaches. Our numerical model suggests that the presence of chaotic dynamics
in the response of individual bundles enhances their ability to synchronize when coupled, resulting
in significant improvement in the system's ability to detect weak signals. This synchronization
persists even for a large frequency dispersion and a large number of oscillators comprising the
system. Further, the amplitude and coherence of the active motion is not reduced upon increasing
the number of oscillators. Using artificial membranes, we impose mechanical coupling on groups
of live and functional hair bundles, selected from in vitro preparations of the sensory epithelium,
allowing us to explore the role of coupling experimentally. Consistent with the numerical simulations
of the chaotic system, synchronization occurs even for large frequency dispersion and a large number
of hair cells. Further, the amplitude and coherence of the spontaneous oscillations are independent
of the number of hair cells in the network. We therefore propose that hair cells utilize their chaotic
dynamics to stabilize the synchronized state and avoid the amplitude death regime, resulting in
collective coherent motion that could play a role in generating spontaneous otoacoustic emissions
and an enhanced ability to detect weak signals.

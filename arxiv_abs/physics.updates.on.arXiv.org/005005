Background: Pressure mapping technology has been adapted to monitor over prolonged periods to
evaluate pressure ulcer risk in individuals during extended lying postures. However, temporal
pressure distribution signals are not currently used to identify posture or mobility. The present
study was designed to examine the potential of an automated approach for the detection of a range
of static lying postures and corresponding transitions between postures.Methods: Healthy subjects
(n = 19) adopted a range of sagittal and lateral lying postures. Parameters reflecting both the interactions
at the support surface and body movements were continuously monitored. Subsequently, the derivative
of each signal was examined to identify transitions between postures. Three machine learning algorithms,
namely Na{\"i}ve-Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector Machine classifiers, were assessed
to predict a range of static postures, established with a training model (n = 9) and validated with
new input from test data (n = 10).Findings: Results showed that the derivative signals provided
a means to detect transitions between postures, with actimetry providing the most distinct signal
perturbations. The accuracy in predicting the range of postures from new test data ranged between
82%--100%, 70%--98% and 69%--100% for Na{\"i}ve-Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors and Support Vector
Machine classifiers, respectively.Interpretation: The present study demonstrated that detection
of both static postures and their corresponding transitions was achieved by combining machine
learning algorithms with robust parameters from two monitoring systems. This approach has the
potential to provide reliable indicators of posture and mobility, to support personalised pressure
ulcer prevention strategies.

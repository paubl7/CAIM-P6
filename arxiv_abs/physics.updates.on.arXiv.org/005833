Thermodynamics tells us to expect underwater contact between two hydrophobic surfaces to result
in stronger adhesion compared to two hydrophilic surfaces. However, presence of water changes
not only energetics, but also the dynamic process of reaching a final state, which couples solid
deformation and liquid evacuation. These dynamics can create challenges for achieving strong
underwater adhesion/friction, which affects diverse fields including soft robotics, bio-locomotion
and tire traction. Closer investigation, requiring sufficiently precise resolution of film evacuation
while simultaneously controlling surface wettability has been lacking. We perform high resolution
in-situ frustrated total internal reflection imaging to track underwater contact evolution between
soft-elastic hemispheres of varying stiffness and smooth-hard surfaces of varying wettability.
Surprisingly, we find exponential rate of water evacuation from hydrophobic-hydrophobic (adhesive)
contact is 3 orders of magnitude lower than that from hydrophobic-hydrophilic (non-adhesive)
contact. The trend of decreasing rate with decreasing wettability of glass sharply changes about
a point where thermodynamic adhesion crosses zero, suggesting a transition in mode of evacuation,
which is illuminated by 3-Dimensional spatiotemporal heightmaps. Adhesive contact is characterized
by the early localization of sealed puddles, whereas non-adhesive contact remains smooth, with
film-wise evacuation from one central puddle. Measurements with a human thumb and alternatively
hydrophobic/hydrophilic glass surface demonstrate practical consequences of the same dynamics:
adhesive interactions cause instability in valleys and lead to a state of more trapped water and
less intimate solid-solid contact.
